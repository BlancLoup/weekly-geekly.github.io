The competition among programmers, however, is also great, so for successful work you need constant improvement of skills.  Studying at a top European university is suitable for this purpose, and it is possible to increase the level of knowledge there with the material support of the educational institution. <br><br>  The <a href="https://studyqa.com/">StudyQA</a> team <a href="https://studyqa.com/">will be</a> happy to tell which universities are suitable for this purpose.

      <b>University of Cambridge (UK)</b> <br><br>  Let's start the selection with the University of Cambridge - the best educational institution for the study of information technology in Europe.  By the way, last year he finished fourth in the <a href="https://www.unipage.net/ru/bachelor_in_uk_experience">list of the</a> best universities in the world according to UniPage.  Not bad, right? <br><br>  Cambridge supports applicants and offers scholarships for undergraduate, graduate and doctoral studies.  On the official website of the University operates a search engine for scholarships.  Scholarships are filtered by specialty, student's country of origin and program of study. <br><br>  ‚Üí <a href="https://www.cambridgetrust.org/scholarships/">Additional information about scholarships</a> <br><br>  <b>ETH Zurich - Swiss Federal Institute of Technology (Switzerland)</b> <br><br>  ETH Zurich, also known as the Swiss Higher Technical School of Zurich, is the <a href="https://www.topuniversities.com/where-to-study/europe/switzerland/guide">most</a> prestigious university in the country.  What is really there, in him, Albert Einstein himself studied.  And now you can learn in it. <br><br>  ETH Zurich offers material support for students of master programs - Excellence Scholarship &amp; Opportunity Program (ESOP) and Master Scholarship Program (MSP).  The first one covers all tuition fees and living expenses, the second covers only part of the school expenses. <br><br>  The criterion for applying for a scholarship is standard - academic performance.  You can apply only if 10% of the exams for the undergraduate degree were passed perfectly. <br><br>  ‚Üí <a href="https://www.ethz.ch/students/en/studies/financial/scholarships/excellencescholarship.html">Additional information about scholarships</a> <br><br>  <b>University of Oxford (United Kingdom)</b> <br><br>  Oxford University is listed as the best educational institution in the world in the prestigious rating of Times Higher Education.  Training in information technologies in it is also at the level - it ranks <a href="https://www.topuniversities.com/university-rankings/university-subject-rankings/2017/computer-science-information-systems">second</a> in Europe in this area.  Education is worth a lot, but you can still learn there as an IT specialist if you get funding.  The university offers a whole list of scholarships for different levels of study.  The list of scholarships for which you can apply is available in a search engine on the <a href="http://www.ox.ac.uk/admissions/graduate/fees-and-funding/fees-funding-and-scholarship-search/search">official website.</a> <br><br>  ‚Üí <a href="http://www.ox.ac.uk/admissions/graduate/fees-and-funding/fees-funding-and-scholarship-search">Additional information about scholarships</a> <br><br>  <b>Imperial College London (United Kingdom)</b> <br><br>  Another British university in our collection is the Imperial College of London.  His material support applies only to doctoral studies.  There are two general scholarships offered: Anne Seagrim Accommodation Scholarship and President's PhD Scholarships.  The first covers only the cost of living, and the second will allow you to pay tuition and living expenses. <br><br>  ‚Üí <a href="https://www.imperial.ac.uk/study/pg/fees-and-funding/scholarships/">Additional information about scholarships</a> <br><br>  <b>Ecole Polytechnique F√©d√©rale de Lausanne (EPFL) (Switzerland)</b> <br><br>  And again Switzerland is on our list, this time - the Federal Polytechnic School of Lausanne.  There, as in ETH Zurich, you can learn to understand information technology with the support of Excellence scholarships.  And, as in ETH Zurich, the scholarship is given exclusively to masters. <br><br>  Excellence provides monthly stipend payments, but does not cover the cost of living and studying.  A small bonus for fellows - guaranteed provision of rooms in the student dormitory. <br><br>  ‚Üí <a href="https://master.epfl.ch/excellence-fellowships">Additional information about scholarships</a> <br><br>  <b>University College London (United Kingdom)</b> <br><br>  Back to the UK again, this time for University College London.  It ranks seventh among the top European universities for IT education.  UCL scholarships are also available: you can use a search engine on the official university website to search for them.  They are available for all levels of study.  When searching, we advise you to pay attention to the criteria - part of the scholarships depends on the current income level of the applicant, and part - on his academic performance. <br><br>  ‚Üí <a href="http://www.ucl.ac.uk/prospective-students/scholarships/latest">Additional information about scholarships</a> <br><br>  <b>Politecnico di Milano (Italy)</b> <br><br>  From London to warm Milan: the next item on our selection is the Milan Technical University.  The official website of the university claims that 99.4% of those who studied information technology there are employed.  The prospect is promising. <br><br>  You can study at the Milan Technical University with a scholarship.  The size of the scholarship depends on the financial situation and academic achievements.  For example, a scholarship for special academic achievements (Merit Based Scholarships) provides for tuition fees and payments from ‚Ç¨ 5,000 to ‚Ç¨ 10,000 for especially distinguished students. <br><br>  ‚Üí <a href="http://www.polinternational.polimi.it/how-to-apply/laurea-magistrale/scholarships/">Additional information about scholarships</a> <br><br>  <b>Aarhus University (Denmark)</b> <br><br>  Aarhus University is one of the largest Danish universities and a supplier of brilliant information technology specialists.  His scholarships are divided into three types: <br>  Government scholarships; <br>  Specialized faculty scholarships (availability depends on the time of admission - winter or summer semester); <br>  Scholarships by country of origin. <br><br>  ‚Üí <a href="http://kandidat.au.dk/en/admission/tuition-fees-and-scholarships/scholarship-programmes/">Additional information about scholarships</a> <br><br>  <b>Delft University of Technology (Netherlands)</b> <br><br>  The next university in our selection of the best European educational institutions for studying IT is Delft Technical University.  In it, as in other universities in this list, you can use a scholarship to study.  Scholarships are divided into two groups: university and state. <br><br>  Despite the fact that the number of scholarships is limited (3 and 8 for the faculty), bonuses are worth it to fight for them.  The first one covers the tuition fee and provides a monthly payment of ‚Ç¨ 950, and the second offers support of ‚Ç¨ 5,000.  Both scholarships cover tuition only. <br><br>  ‚Üí <a href="https://www.tudelft.nl/en/education/practical-matters/scholarships/">Additional information about scholarships</a> <br><br>  <b>KU Leuven (Belgium)</b> <br><br>  Closes our top 10 Leuven Catholic University.  He offers both state and university scholarships.  Scholarships are focused on the master's and doctoral studies. <br><br>  ‚Üí <a href="https://www.kuleuven.be/english/international/development-cooperation/funding-possibilities/scholarships">Additional information about scholarships</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/346168/">https://habr.com/ru/post/346168/</a></p>
