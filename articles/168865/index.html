      <b>More than half of Android devices are still 2.2 and 2.3</b> <br>  <a href="http://developer.android.com/about/dashboards/index.html">Eng</a> <br>  New Google statistics show that the Jelly Bean version now uses a total of 13.6% of devices - 12.2% of Android 4.1 and 1.4% of Android 4.2.  At the same time, almost half (45.6%) still work on Gingerbread, and the share of Android 4.0, Ice Cream Sandwich has even declined over the last month - from 29.1% to 29%.  The sad thing is that 8.1% is still sitting on Android 2.2 (Froyo).  Thus, more than half of Android devices are outdated models with Android 2.2 or Android 2.3. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/6e8/f43/132/6e8f43132406045971e446f8eab009e5.png"><br><br>  <b>Software development for Nexus 7</b> <br>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/168769/">Rus</a> <br>  At the moment I have written only one application using the Nexus 7 tablet. However, its sales in the Play Market have already paid for the price of the tablet.  In the process of writing was also used a laptop at home to bring the application to mind.  However, the first version was entirely written on the tablet.  The only serious problem at the moment is that AIDE does not know how to build projects with reference dependencies (ADT feature in Eclipse).  Therefore, to build an application that uses libraries like ActionBarSherlock is very problematic.  I can imagine the solution to the problem, but I have not yet gone deep.  If you do not use references, then there will be no problems. <br><br>  <b>Wine for Android</b> <br>  <a href="http://thenextweb.com/apps/2013/02/03/wine-for-linux-is-going-mobile-you-will-soon-be-able-to-run-windows-apps-on-android/">Eng</a> |  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/168155/">Rus</a> <br>  At the Free and Open Source Software Developers European Meeting conference, which was held at the weekend in Brussels, Alexander Julliard, the leader of the Wine project, announced that Wine will be ported to Android. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/def/7b7/07d/def7b707dd58ca1235aa3453b45bbfa4.jpg"><br><br>  <b>Android leads advertising</b> <br>  <a href="http://www.insidemobileapps.com/2013/02/01/millennial-media-android-platform-accounts-for-64-of-games-impressions-12-percent-higher-than-the-ad-networks-platform-average-for-android/">Eng</a> |  <a href="http://apps4all.ru/news/applications/android-lidiruet-v-reklame.html">Rus</a> <br>  The new report Millennial Media Mobile Mix shows that smartphones in general and Android in particular occupy most of the impressions in the company's advertising network.  Millennial Media tracks ad impressions in gaming applications depending on the operating system ‚Äî Android, iOS, BlackBerry, and Windows.  Android is leading in this area, occupying 64% of gaming hits on the platform, in general, 52% of all hits comes from Android devices.  iOS is in second place with 30% of online impressions. <br><br>  <b>dot42 - C # compiler for Dalvik Runtime</b> <br>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/168689/">Rus</a> <br>  The main disadvantage of Mono for Android is that applications require a separate runtime environment, different from Dalvik.  And while full access to the CLR looks very attractive, proxying and marshalling calls from one runtime environment to another can greatly affect performance.  So why not remove the intermediate compilation in the IL code and get a working Dex code right away?  This is what the dot42 project does. <br><br><h4>  iOS </h4><br>  <b>Apple will provide the developer the opportunity to receive short links to applications.</b> <br>  <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/02/03/apple-debuts-new-vanity-urls-for-app-store-developers-during-super-bowl-domain-name-land-grab-to-follow/">Eng</a> <br>  During the Super Bowl, Apple introduced a glimpse of a new product for App Store developers - short links to AppStore.com.  At the end of the trailer for the Star Trek universe, a link is provided that directs viewers to Appstore.com/StarTrekApp instead of, for example, Facebook.com/StarTrekMovie or the film‚Äôs official website, as is usually done during television advertising. <br><br>  <b>How to use the Instruments utility in Xcode</b> <br>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/168491/">Rus</a> <br>  At this point, your iOS development career is in the state where you wrote one application or two, and you are certainly wondering what you can do to make your applications even better.  In addition to improving your application by adding to it all kinds of "curlicues", there is one thing that all good developers have to do with their code - process it with the Instruments utility! <br><br>  <b>Garbage collector in iOS?</b>  <b>Not!</b>  <b>Efficient memory management with ARC.</b>  <b>Part 1.</b> <br>  <a href="http://www.enterra.ru/blog/garbage_collector_in_ios/">Rus</a> <br>  Apple introduced the technology of automatic reference counting in 2011 and recommended ARC for use in new projects, as well as transferring the existing code under the control of ARC.  However, not all developers were quick to change the already familiar patterns of manual memory management with the advent of the new technology.  One of the reasons is that ARC does not just relieve the programmer from having to explicitly send retain and release messages, but also requires more understanding and attention to the relationships and connections between objects, the right approach to writing code, as well as knowledge and understanding of some features. which will be noted in the following sections. <br><br><h4>  Windows phone </h4><br>  <b>Nokia</b> <br>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/168097/">Nokia, The Elop Effect and the burning platform</a> - <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/168173/">Once again about the statistics, Nokia, Elop and burning memo</a> <br>  Just two articles highlighting the recent past - the transition of Nokia on Windows Phone.  One is always in favor, the other is always against. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/92b/ae2/b5b/92bae2b5bf5cea8c32049177ccaf32e1.jpg"><br><br>  <b>Development of the Sheremetyevo application for Windows Phone through the eyes of a developer</b> <br>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/168309/">Rus</a> <br>  I received from friends and colleagues requests to tell about the development of the Sheremetyevo application and now, when Aplana allowed me to tell about the development of this application, I decided to publish an article with answers to the most frequently asked questions. <br><br>  <b>Windows Phone for the first time overtook BlackBerry in the US market</b> <br>  <a href="http://bgr.com/2013/02/05/windows-phone-blackberry-market-share-316540/">Eng</a> |  <a href="http:/apps4all.ru/news/applications/android-lidiruet-v-reklame.html">Rus</a> <br>  One of the most interesting stories in the mobile market in 2013 will be the battle for third place between Windows Phone and BlackBerry - the positions of the two leaders seem clear and unshakable, but for the third place a serious struggle will unfold.  And it does not start too well for a Canadian company. <br><br>  <b>AppClub {build, monetize} # 4 will be held February 21 in Kiev</b> <br>  <a href="http://wp7rocks.com/posts/details/8230">Rus</a> <br><br>  <b>Developer earned $ 30,000 per month on Windows 8 applications</b> <br>  <a href="http://wp7rocks.com/posts/details/8222">Rus</a> <br>  Kevin Ashley, developer of Windows Phone and Windows 8 applications, as well as Microsoft employee and author of the Professional Windows 8 Programming: Application Development with C # and XAML, earned about $ 30,000 in a month from his "Card Games Chest" application (using in-app purchase and app sales). <br><br><h4>  Blackberry </h4><br>  <b>BlackBerry 10 upgrade to Android 4.1 Jelly Bean</b> <br>  <a href="http://www.phonearena.com/news/Your-BlackBerry-Z10-may-soon-execute-Android-apps-in-a-4.1-Jelly-Bean-environment_id39475">Eng</a> |  <a href="http://apps4all.ru/news/rim/blackberry-10-obnovyat-do-android-4-1.html">Rus</a> <br>  The BlackBerry company (known to us as RIM) announced that the runtime will be updated to a more modern version - Android 4.1 Jelly Bean.  When this happens is unknown, but when it happens, the work of Android applications inside the BB10 should improve significantly. <br><br><h4>  Applications </h4><br>  <b>"Fight" against piracy in Russian</b> <br>  Google and Apple blocked the Moon + Reader application and a number of other readers on the LitRes complaint. <br>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/168003/">Habr</a> |  <a href="http://www.exler.ru/blog/item/13271/">Exler</a> |  <a href="http://www.exler.ru/blog/item/13282/">Exler: what to do</a> |  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/168841/">Return of the reader</a> |  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/168749/">Moon + Reader restored on Google Play</a> <br><br><h4>  Devices </h4><br>  <b>Berners-Lee: No Root?</b>  <b>Your device serves others</b> <br>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/apps4all/blog/168239/">Rus</a> <br>  ‚ÄúThe right to have root on your machine,‚Äù full administrative privileges to access a device, such as a smartphone, is a ‚Äúkey question,‚Äù said Tim Berners-Lee to an audience at the 2013 Canberra Linux.conf.au conference.  ‚ÄúThe right to have a root on your car is the right to own a thing that you can dispose of at your discretion,‚Äù he said. <br><br><h4>  Money </h4><br>  <b>Kongregate invests $ 10 million in support of mobile developers</b> <br>  <a href="http://venturebeat.com/2013/02/04/gamestops-kongregate-to-invest-10m-in-mobile-game-developers/">Eng</a> |  <a href="http://apps4all.ru/news/applications/kongregate-investiruet-10-mln.html">Rus</a> <br>  Kongregate (a division of GameStop, one of the largest online gaming sites) announced plans to invest $ 10 million in mobile developers. <br><br>  <b>GREE expands its investment program by $ 10 million</b> <br>  <a href="http://www.insidemobileapps.com/2013/02/05/gree-lifts-the-lid-off-10m-investment-fund-for-mobile-game-developers/">Eng</a> <br>  The Japanese company intends to increase its Partners Fund, an investment program for social and mobile developers, by $ 10 million. <br><br>  <b>Amazon introduces Amazon Coin's own money</b> <br>  <a href="http://www.insidemobileapps.com/2013/02/05/amazon-coins-virtual-currency-coming-in-may/">Eng</a> |  <a href="http://apps4all.ru/news/applications/amazon-coin.html">Rus</a> <br>  Amazon launches Amazon Coin, a virtual currency for app purchases and app purchases.

At the moment, for the coins of NARRs, you can purchase exclusive collectible items from each series, which will appear in a special section of the NARR8 menu - "My Collections". <br><br>  <b>FarmVille bought goods worth $ 1 billion</b> <br>  <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/02/05/zynga-q4/">Eng</a> |  <a href="http://apps4all.ru/news/applications/farmville-1-milliard.html">Rus</a> <br>  In general, according to the results of the fourth quarter, Zynga exceeded analysts' expectations in terms of revenue.  However, CityVille 2, Party Friends and The Friend Game will be closed.  Considerably a big loss, perhaps, is CityVille 2, the sequel to the company's most successful game.  Zynga has previously closed 11 games and held a series of layoffs. <br><br><h4>  Other </h4><br>  <b>Javascript will become the main thing in GNOME</b> <br>  <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2013/02/05/gnome_standardises_on_javascript/">Eng</a> <br>  The developers have announced that JavaScript will be the only first class language for developing applications for the platform. <br><br>  <b>Dropbox introduced Sync API, which greatly simplified work with the cloud</b> <br>  <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/02/06/dropbox-unveils-sync-api-for-mobile-developers-allows-apps-to-work-with-cloud-based-files-as-if-they-were-local/">Eng</a> |  <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/developers/blog/26">Eng</a> <br>  Sync API greatly simplifies the integration of Dropbox in applications and work with files.
