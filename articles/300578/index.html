      We continue to publish useful materials that will help you in building effective marketing, since marketing is the only thing that you can‚Äôt use to us. <br>  This simple article in which the main types of marketing are listed is very useful to answer the question ‚ÄúAm I doing everything for my business?‚Äù.  Let's put it another way, if you do not use at least one of the ‚Äútechniques‚Äù listed in this ‚Äúcaptain's‚Äù article, then you need to urgently start doing something.  :-) <br><br>  Sincerely yours, <a href="http://landing.yamboks.ru/">Yambox</a> full-line operator <br>  ( <a href="http://landing.yamboks.ru/">Yambox</a> - turn your online store into a computer game) <br><br><h4>  <b>1. Content Marketing</b> </h4><br>  The ability to write is, in essence, the ability to communicate online.  Each product description in e-commerce, each blog post, each article with advice, each page about you, each video clip is content marketing.  Creating and distributing consumer-friendly information will help you ‚Äúpump‚Äù marketing into ecommerce.  If this tool is not taken seriously, then your materials can only cause a smile of the buyer. <br><br>  The following example will not leave any doubt.  This real message was sent to thousands of subscribers in support of one of the ‚ÄúHot Saturdays‚Äù (name of sale). <br><br>  ‚ÄúIf you are waiting for the best time of the year, spring, then your patience will be rewarded!  On __________ (the name of the retailer was deleted) <b>,</b> Saturday <b>night</b> (in the original, the first letter ‚Äúg‚Äù was omitted from the word ‚Äúhot‚Äù) On Saturday this weekend and only one day you can get huge discounts!  ‚Äû <br><br>  Check your text and correct errors and omissions - a necessary condition for successful marketing. <br><br><h4>  <b>2. Data analysis, analytics</b> </h4><br>  Successful marketers check facts and statistics to make the right decisions about how to invest in marketing and promotion.  This ability to view facts and understand the meaning of statistics is called data analysis.  This is important for modern e-commerce marketing. <br><br>  Three trends were identified: <br><br><ul><li>  According to a survey conducted at the end of 2015 in the United States, companies plan to increase their investment in marketing analytics by 73 percent over the next three years; </li></ul><br><ul><li>  Data analysis affects many areas of marketing, including customer acquisition, marketing mix, customer retention, social media, segmentation and promotion strategies; </li></ul><br><ul><li>  Marketing organizations are not as efficient at processing data as they are expected of. </li></ul><br>  Only those marketers who can more effectively use and understand the data will succeed. <br><br><h4>  <b>3. Testing and data collection</b> </h4><br>  Close to the content of the analysis, is the ability to collect facts and statistics on the marketing effectiveness of your company. <br><br>  This marketing skill includes the ability to properly configure Google Analytics or similar platforms, optimizing them for your e-commerce business with specific, meaningful reports.  This skill includes an understanding of how to test platforms, such as, for example, Optimizely, or similar.  It also includes the ability to pick up data from each software package that your business uses, such as sales data, email reports, or order management. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/69e/1ee/21f/69e1ee21fb9246fe97e97507565c8a4f.png" alt="image"><br>  <i>In this example, measuring or gathering information about when respondents took part in a competition made it easy to see the impact email marketing had.</i>  <i>Thus, monitoring could lead to the adoption of the most optimal decisions in the future.</i> <br><br>  If you are able to gather useful information about how your marketing works, you will most likely make the right decisions based on this information. <br><br><h4>  <b>4. Design</b> </h4><br>  Graphic and web design are the basics of internet marketing.  The method of publishing an advertisement, article, or even a page with a detailed image of the product being sold may have a significant impact on how the marketing message or even the product itself is perceived. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/2a4/66e/42a/2a466e42ac9c409bb5edd2b4d908fc4e.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Advertising campaigns in terms of increasing the value of brands are aimed at stimulating the purchase of services or products.  One of the most important factors encouraging a customer to make a purchase is trust.  Brands receive an assessment of buyers in this way, when buyers conditionally designate for themselves in their minds: this brand represents quality and luxury for me, and this one is comfort and reliability. <br><br>  Regardless of what is most important for your client in his value system, your brand will only conditionally denote certain features that the buyer will endow it with in his head.  Every piece of creativity that you make - blog posts, brochures, Google PPC (pay-per-click), participation in industry shows - always something of the above will be able to tell about your brand. <br><br>  If the design is less than professional and only combined with the main idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe brand, it can devalue both your years of work and good customer impressions.  In contrast, good design speaks volumes, for example, about the professionalism of the company itself, quality and positioning in the market. <br><br>  Like your website, your advertisements and branded materials must be dealt with seriously in order to achieve success in your business of ecommerce. <br><br><h4>  <b>5. Development</b> </h4><br>  For example, the ability to write code can be a huge advantage for marketers.  This skill may be in understanding HTML and CSS, with the help of which you will improve the performance of your work on publishing articles in WordPress (one of the content management systems).  Or it may be the ability to develop your own marketing tools and reports. <br><br>  By some estimates, half of all digital marketing vacancies require at least some technical knowledge.  This is true because most of what is being done on the Internet requires at least an understanding of coding. <br><br>  Learn to code and you will have more control over marketing.  With more control, your chances of success increase. <br><br><h4>  <b>6. Advertising</b> </h4><br>  Advertising in ekommers should be planned, full of creativity, payback and verified.  It should come through many channels, using many forms of media, including pay-per-click advertising in search engines and social media sites, display advertising, hidden advertising, mobile, video clips, and so on. <br><br>  An effective marketer understands how advertising works and seeks to maximize sales through it. <br><br>  Advertising management is a high-class marketing skill that can take a long time to learn and even more lengthy to master.  But it's worth it, because advertising can increase sales and profits. <br><br><h4>  <b>7. Email Marketing</b> </h4><br>  With the help of your email address, you can be easily figured out on the Internet.  This, to some extent, is your digital name, and email marketing can be one of the best ways to find new customers.  You can communicate directly with consumers who know your company and are interested in your products. <br><br>  In fact, a study by the Direct Marketing Association found that many people consider email marketing to be the most effective marketing tool. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e17/01e/47d/e1701e47d3184b8ab9f5d4d96b193823.png" alt="image"><br>  <i>A study by the Association of Direct Marketing has shown that many marketers are confident in increasing the company's profits through email marketing.</i> <br><br><h4>  <b>8. Marketing Automation</b> </h4><br>  Marketing automation can reduce marketing costs, increase the conversion rate, increase the average cost of the order, and in some cases even improve the impression of the buyer. <br>  Marketing automation involves managing processes and a sequence of managed actions on automation platforms such as Marketo, Infusionsoft, or MailChimp. <br>  Find automation tools suitable for your company and master them. <br><br><h4>  <b>9. Search engine optimization.</b> </h4><br>  Search engine optimization is a process in which they are doing everything possible to make the web pages of your website easier and faster to be found in search engines.  The idea is that if Google, Bing and other search engines can easily find and catalog what is on your page, then they can also easily highlight your site on the relevant search results pages. <br><br>  The goal of SEO is not to trick search engines with fake website content or keyword stuff, but rather to help search engines find and understand your content. <br><br>  And it‚Äôs quite natural that SEO will help to make your website easy to find for a client, which, again, will lead to successful marketing results. <br><br>  Sincerely yours, <a href="http://landing.yamboks.ru/">Yambox</a> full-line operator <br>  ( <a href="http://landing.yamboks.ru/">Yambox</a> - turn your online store into a computer game) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/300578/">https://habr.com/ru/post/300578/</a></p>
