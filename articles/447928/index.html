This invention of mankind has become an indispensable aspect of everyone‚Äôs life.  And of course, the Internet has a great impact on the life of a particular person and society as a whole. <br><br>  Of course, now there are a lot of articles on the topic ‚ÄúPros and cons of the Internet‚Äù and there are quite banal things listed there.  But sometimes, to dig a little deeper, you need to remember what lies on the surface.  Therefore, perhaps, I'll start with a simple banal, which is obvious to almost everyone.  I will not razmusolivat, but briefly explain. <br><br>  So, we first consider the positive aspects of the influence of the Internet on external factors of the human environment. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b>Pros:</b>

      <b>1.</b> Alternative ways to make money. <br><br>  With the advent of the Internet the opportunity to work remotely.  Such a fashionable word now "freelancer."  In Soviet times, you would be looked at as insane, twisted at the temple and would be told to do business, and not just this.  But not now.  The Internet opened the door to many new professions, and also helped a huge number of people start working for themselves, planning their working day and their free time on their own. <br><br>  <b>2.</b> Friends around the world. <br><br>  If earlier you and your ‚Äúclose soul‚Äù were born in different parts of the world, then, my friend, you are not lucky.  For you may never meet (and maybe you will, fate is such a thing).  But I will not write here love stories, in general, it was hard to find some close person, if this was not your environment.  Of course there is a whole city, a country, after all.  But now the Internet has expanded these borders dozens, hundreds of times.  Now you can correspond with a foreigner, having vague ideas about his language, simply by driving in a phrase into an online translator.  Of course, everything is still far from ideal, but if you look at this huge leap in progress, it seems that the future is close enough. <br><br>  <b>3.</b> Without leaving home. <br><br>  Well, everything is very simple here.  Absolutely everything can be delivered home, just place an application on the right site or online store.  Without departing from the cash register.  Chose.  Ordered.  Paid  Received.  Another question is that sometimes we miscalculate with the actual look.  But this is a separate issue.  Someone may say that this is a minus, but considering that the author is a bit introvert, so he will go to the pros, do not be angry :) <br><br>  <b>4.</b> Availability of knowledge. <br><br>  If earlier, in order to learn something in some field, you had to go to the library, find a book, write it out, read a bunch of unnecessary and unfiltered information to extract even a drop of knowledge (and if your topic is not developed at all in your country, then forgive me somehow), now everything is very simple.  Opened the search bar.  Scored a request.  Enjoy it  Information from around the world.  Full web of knowledge.  Although here now there are a sufficient number of articles with excess material.  But still it does not compare with what it was. <br><br>  Talked about the good, why not come to the bad.  This is where the "granny" mode is turned on. <br><blockquote>  "Here in my time" </blockquote><br><blockquote>  "It used to be better" </blockquote><br>  So, the <b>cons:</b> <br><br>  1. Alternative reality. <br><br>  Sometimes a person does not like his own life.  And to change it is not enough strength or courage.  Therefore, people head off into a virtual machine, just to feel like those who in real life they are not. <br><br>  2. Harsh advertising. <br><br>  I think everyone sitting here has an AdBlock.  Not from a wonderful life, I suppose.  And indeed, advertising is becoming too much.  She becomes too intrusive, too open, too frank.  It undermines the moral principles of many people.  And it‚Äôs scary to run children on the Internet at all, as if it‚Äôs released into the street with maniacs.  I immediately recall the 1st season of the Black Mirror series, where a person was forced to open his eyes to watch an advertisement.  Funny is not it? <br><br>  3. Minimum responsibility. <br><br>  When you do not directly see the face of the interlocutor, you do not hear his voice, then some people immediately have a feeling of freedom that no one is watching you.  A slight degree of permissiveness inspires the head and write disappeared.  Insults, mate, threats - this is only a small part, which allows a person who feels impunity and freedom of action. <br><br>  4. Health. <br><br>  Although rather it applies to all computers in general.  Let's not even talk about sight, this is clear to the hedgehog.  Simply, even if you take into account the sedentary lifestyle at the computer, which inevitably leads to problems with the cardiovascular system, overweight, nervous system.  You can continue the list yourself, each has its own.  But movement - this is the life <s>my roof said and went</s> , so with a lack of activities the body begins to crumble anyway. <br><br>  So, well, sort of dealt with the basics and banalities.  And then comes the most interesting.  How does the internet affect our brain?  This is a global part of our life, our work, our productivity.  We can say that this is us, our personality.  How does the Internet affect our most important body? <br><br>  <b>1. The</b> availability of information causes amnesia in a person. <br><br>  When a person knows in his subcortex that at any moment he can extract information using the Internet at hand, he begins to remember information worse.  All this becomes a kind of addiction to the Internet.  We remember only the method of obtaining information, and not its very essence.  And that's the problem.  You can read more about this effect on the <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A6%25D0%25B8%25D1%2584%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B0%25D1%258F_%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BC%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B7%25D0%25B8%25D1%258F">wiki</a> . <br><br>  <b>2. The</b> excessive flow of information. <br><br>  The large flow of information and knowledge coming from the Internet, as well as the inability to filter and structure them, strongly influence our perception of reality.  The brain begins to be confused in the testimony and sometimes creates non-existent memories.  And just putting everything on the shelves, you realize that you saw this cupboard in a photo from a friend in Vkontakte, and not what you were going to buy it. <br><br>  <b>3.</b> Lack of stimulation. <br><br>  Even the worst and poor quality training stimulates us to think.  Training is not a school and an institute (although they include), but the activity that is done by the brain and is currently quite difficult for it.  You can not read books and hope to become a master. <br><br>  <u>A small sammari:</u> <br><br>  Everything in this life must be lived through experience, in practice.  This machine and dry information will never teach, and in this they will never replace living people.  In order for the brain to live, to think, to develop and flourish, you need to constantly water and nourish it.  For people to live, you need to develop the brain.  It's simple.  You need to go in different directions, apply knowledge in real life, do not be afraid to try and start.  And the Internet should be a tool in our hands to achieve our goals, and not the meaning of life.  And then everything will be right and in their places. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/447928/">https://habr.com/ru/post/447928/</a></p>
