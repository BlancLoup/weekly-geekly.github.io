  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Visit to ASICMINER farm</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  During my visit to Hong Kong today, I saw a green container ship on a square near the Wan Chai territory (near the subway), two open cartoon tigers came out of the open doors and, turning to me, offered to visit their bitcoin farm!  To the sound of attractive light music, I went inside and saw some meter-high tanks made of transparent glass, filled with liquid for a third, with numerous green boards immersed in this liquid, between which bubbles were quietly gurgling.  From each glass tank rise copper pipes connected to a small cooling installation.  Condensed liquid vapors drip down from time to time.  LEDs are constantly flashing, creating the impression of the presence of life. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/0b2/79f/fd2/0b279ffd2c0d43d042903e4adf20062d.jpg" alt="image" vspace="20" hspace="20"><br>  _ <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/3c4/0aa/68a/3c40aa68a07dda792f96594942294b20.jpg" alt="image" vspace="20" hspace="20"><br><br>  Well, I must admit, there was a piece of science fiction above.  I have not seen a container ship near the territory of Wan Chai, it does not exist.  But what I wrote next is reality.  In fact, with the permission of friedcat, I, as an official Bitell reporter and YangYang show, visited the ASICMINER secret farm located in Hong Kong on November 22.  And, fortunately, I am the first person on the planet who has received such an opportunity.

The construction of the farm began in August 2013 with the acquisition of the best cooling plant and pumps in China.  With the help of a crane, they were installed on the roof.  By the beginning of October, this farm began to function.  By ensuring this, the entire technical support team did an incredible job trying to outrun the time. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/389/00f/db1/38900fdb13a7fec8d02c08d02f388f78.jpg" alt="image" vspace="20" hspace="20"><br>  _ <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/192/099/0e7/1920990e7172049167b2e24d61293c51.jpg" alt="image" vspace="20" hspace="20"><br><br>  The farm is located on an industrial site, consists of many standard racks, which can be found in any data center.  Each rack contains 3 sealed glass tanks, inside which "blades" work silently, from which wires go to the switches. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d13/06a/bb5/d1306abb58ef0c93cef5c1d815e5a32b.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  If you turn off the air ventilation, then this place will become quieter than the library.  By comparison, I once had several Avalons, so their roar was heard even behind two closed heavy doors.  This system looks harmonious, and the shiny pipes, and the red valves hanging side by side fit perfectly into the big picture. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/dee/e5f/77e/deee5f77e338dfa98dc80ce26043e49e.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Alex told me: <br>  The technology of cooling by immersion was developed not one year, very carefully.  He showed me a prototype of a fluid container designed for ASICMINER tests.  The first version of the Block Erupter Blade mining boards contained many external interfaces equipped with large-sized heat sinks for air cooling.  Now, the new Blade board has been significantly improved to optimize the results of fluid cooling.  Boards are reduced in height, which allowed the use of less fluid.  In fact, this cooling technology is the most advanced on the planet.  The same technique is used in supercomputer systems.  Through the use of immersion cooling technology, it became possible to significantly clarify the calculations associated with heat removal in comparison with the air cooling system.  At the moment, each container with liquid can hold 92 "blades", and in the future - possibly more.  Every 200 liters of fluid can absorb heat from the boards, with a total capacity of up to 4 kW.  Each cooling tube can absorb up to 25 kW of heat, in each tank 4 sets of cooling tubes can be installed. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/8b5/47e/e93/8b547ee9301cf1792d4637d22ef95d61.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  In the world of Bitcoin, time is everything.  In order to speed up the introduction of the system, all sorts of common equipment was used: from racks to valves that can be bought at any market.  After the mining and cooling equipment is installed, the weight of each tank is about 200 kg.  Instead of using expensive rails in racks, the surface on which the container slides is covered with Teflon, which has little resistance to friction.  This greatly facilitated all operations related to the installation of the container. <br><br>  This system inherits practicality, simplicity, low cost and high performance - the characteristics that friedcat forms the basis for fast and easily scalable deployment. <br>  The tank is not like the walls of a reactor designed for high temperatures or pressures.  When I touched the outside of the tank wall - its temperature was not higher than the body temperature.  Alex showed me an application on his iPhone, which displayed the temperature of the room, the temperature of the fluid coming in for cooling and the temperature of the fluid that absorbed the heat released during the operation of the equipment ‚Äî all within 37 degrees.  Liquid production 3M, very expensive, not only non-flammable, but also used for fire fighting purposes.  You can find its use in rich financial information processing centers.  Fire extinguishing systems also use it. <br><br>  Low temperature, lack of pressure, refractory materials - all this provides an incomparable level of security. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/950/5ad/071/9505ad071f800094139e1099d61d1b74.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Stability is a requirement of a mining farm.  All cooling systems and pumps are backed up.  The farm is connected to the Internet with three uplinks.  Each electronic device operating in the tank is carefully checked and connected in the most optimal way.  Many people have access to knowledge about research and development, and among them - the development of chips - the most important part of a large-scale implementation project on the Bitcoin market.  But not many people have access to information about the cost of the spent man-hours and the time needed to perfect the technology.  The team of friedcat-a owns real experience and all the necessary knowledge. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/841/d08/952/841d0895249f5c9472581d48eb06b1ea.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  This farm does not work at full capacity, some racks are empty in anticipation.  I suppose, in anticipation of boards with chips of a new generation from ASICMINER. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c34/0ab/ee0/c340abee0d71f8f62b3cf55a7aa66632.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Based on a modern immersion cooling system, ASICMINER guarantees a future farm that is easily scalable and expandable.  The system is fully equipped and its price is also determined. <br>  It is designed for large-scale deployment around the world, only power supply is required, a network connection and a serious commercial implementation project can be considered complete anywhere. <br>  Yes, by the way, in an area with a cool climate, this system can give off the heat produced in production for space heating. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/5af/d5c/fcb/5afd5cfcb6fc41a3d657910277b03352.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  And, yes, perhaps in a few months the container that I described at the very beginning will become a reality. <br><br>  With thanks, I will accept amendments and corrections, especially if there is something inaccurate in the description of technical issues. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/203998/">https://habr.com/ru/post/203998/</a></p>
