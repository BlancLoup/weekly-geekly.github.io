  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The most effective methods of promotion of iPad and iPhone applications on the Apple AppStore (Part 2)</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  In the <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/macosxdev/125906/">previous article</a> , written about 2 months ago, I described some of the marketing and advertising methods of application promotion in the AppStore, I also promised to write how long our application was in the TOP-10 Russian apstor, as well as what additional promotion methods were used, so everything is in order. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  In TOP 10, we lasted exactly two and a half days, and then began to slide down smoothly.  Promo codes have ended, reviews have been written on almost all popular sites and have also gone on the second and third pages, according to the plan there were only 2 recent ways left, namely to try advertising through Admob and ispreadnews.com service, by the way, this service was also found on the habr. <br><br>  About Admob (www.admob.com - Google service) was talked and written a lot, and for the most part not very good reviews and recommendations were written, such as ‚ÄúDo not waste your time on admob‚Äù, ‚ÄúExpenses on admob do not pay off sales‚Äù and t .d  But, since  Our alphabet was falling down (at the time of launching admob, we were not even in the TOP 200 of the Russian appstora) we decided to try.  I threw $ 200 on admob, created an advertising campaign and sent it for moderation.  If someone has previously worked with Google Adwords, it will not be difficult for him to create ads in admob, because  here the procedure is almost the same, i.e.  create the name of an advertising campaign, then target your advertising geographically, choose which devices to show advertising, choose the type of traffic, set a price for the transition, load a banner and wait.  I had to wait 3 days.  We targeted our advertising to Russia, only for iPad devices, and only for wifi traffic, since  The application weighs more than 20 MB.  The minimum price for the transfer was set at 5 cents, and the daily budget was set at $ 100. <br><br>  After 2 days, the money was spent, and our application came out in the general TOP 50 and TOP 2 of its section.  During these 2 days there were absolutely 110 purchases.  What can I say, the result is really not very good, because  Spending $ 200 earned about $ 150 (our application costs $ 1.99 and a 30% apple commission).  Now about the good, in admob there is a functionality called the ‚Äúdelivery method‚Äù, which is divided into 2 points ‚ÄúStandard - show ads evenly through a day‚Äù and ‚ÄúShow ads as quickly ad possible‚Äù, the default is the first, i.e.  In our case, the daily budget of $ 100 will be spent evenly throughout the day, but if you choose the second, the same $ 100 will be spent as quickly as possible.  The second method paid for itself, i.e.  not the advertisement itself paid for itself, but the TOPs, i.e.  due to the fast advertising, we were in total TOP 30 and TOP 1 of our section, as well as our icon got into featured and top grossing, from where natural sales began.  Those.  When using admob, it is important to understand that advertising as such will not pay for itself, but due to a sharp jump upwards and getting into the TOPs, natural sales can begin, which can recoup advertising costs and make a profit.

      In the ispreadnews.com service, we ordered the most expensive package ‚ÄúPackage ALL - Sending announcement to 384 sites in 23 languages‚Äù.  In principle, we did not expect any special results, since  Our alphabet is only in Russian, and this package included the placement of press releases and articles on foreign websites.  About 100 letters arrived, but there was no jump in sales, although the guys from this service worked very quickly and efficiently.  I believe that if your application is not only in Russian, then this service will be useful. <br><br> <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/ru/app/little-genius/id465059157%3Fl%3Dru%26ls%3D1%26mt%3D8"><img src="http://genius.stylemix.net/icon2.png" alt="image"></a> <br><br>  Having summarized and implemented all the promotion methods described in the first and second articles (except for the prgage.com service) using the example of another application <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/ru/app/little-genius/id465059157%3Fl%3Dru%26ls%3D1%26mt%3D8">‚ÄúLittle Genius‚Äù</a> , I can draw the following conclusions, which, in my opinion, will be very useful for developers in terms of building marketing and choosing a common development strategy: <br><br>  1. Immediately after you have uploaded your application to itunesconnect and it has fallen on moderation, start doing an update, because  After each update, Apple gives an additional 50 promotional codes, and accordingly, after appearing in the store, immediately fill in the update in order to receive new codes in a week. <br><br>  2. Promotion should be done in a complex, and in no case separately, please note that as a rule the sweetest are the first 2 months of sales.  I think that if within 30 days the application at least did not pay for the development, then it is worth thinking very seriously. <br><br>  3. It is advisable to specialize in one subject, and not to scatter in all sections, i.e.  For example, we chose a specific market segment, namely, educational programs and games for children of preschool age.  Even if you look at the big players, almost everyone has a certain segment.  Segmentation allows you to sell several similar programs on the same subject to the same buyer, because  the buyer is usually looking for something purposefully, for example, tutorials and games for his child. <br><br>  4. Last, the application itself must be really high quality in all respects.  I try to constantly monitor the app, and several times I bought programs that attracted me with their icon and high-quality screenshots, since  I often am one of the first customers, but there are no reviews about the program yet, but having pecked at a beautiful picture after a minute of using it, I begin to understand that the developers have deceived me (the mechanics of the game are terrible, the program constantly crashes, etc.).  In the first article I wrote how important it is to make a high-quality icon and screenshots, yes it is really important, but the program or game itself is just as important.  Test and test again, the weekly delay in the publication will not affect the sales, and bugs and shortcomings can very seriously affect the reputation and just fill up the whole project, because  after a dozen negative reviews simply stop buying it. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/129693/">https://habr.com/ru/post/129693/</a></p>
