  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The first meeting with the customer, we squeeze the maximum.</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  I have been working on custom software development projects for several years and often at the beginning of my work, I was worried about how I can extract the maximum amount of useful and structured information about the future system.  Indeed, more often than not, even for a commercial offer, it is necessary to present both technologies and exemplary methods of implementation, and this can all change the price.  Yes, and about the timing would be nice to tell. <br><br>  I managed to find the best option for myself. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  At first meetings, I always dreamed of capturing thoughts, because you will agree, not every person can express thoughts consistently and structured.  Most often, the customer has light chaos in his head with a kaleidoscope of beautiful views of the future system, as well as beautiful pictures of how his business instantly goes uphill immediately after implementation.  And if you ask questions without a clear plan, meetings can take a long time. <br><br>  Now I act according to the plan and this allows me to immediately win in many areas: <br><ul><li>  I save my and others time by reducing the number of meetings.  This is especially relevant in connection with the craze for personal effectiveness. </li><li>  I immediately show myself a professional with a certain approach to work.  This gives me extra points and takes them away from potential competitors. </li><li>  I am deeply immersed in the system and I can already write a preliminary statement of work for performers on it or on its separate part (in case the system is large). </li></ul><br>  What is my plan?

    <h2>  Preparing for the meeting </h2><br><h3>  Writing accessories </h3><br>  I stock up with plain and colored pencils, a sharpener, an eraser, and a drawing album.  It is much more convenient than a set of sheets, and the paper is denser, which allows it to not crumple when wiping. <br><br><h3>  Dictaphone </h3><br>  It will help to remember some important moments from the meeting, if you forget them later, when analyzing the results.  And in any case, it never hurts to refresh your memory.  Just do not forget to warn the person that your meeting is being recorded, maybe he will be against it, although the likelihood of this is small. <br><br><h3>  A place </h3><br>  You can meet in offices, although personally I like in a cafe more.  All the same, our offices are usually completely uncomfortable places, and for a meeting and a good conversation, you need a cozy place, it would be better with a delicious coffee or tea.  But of course the cafe should be without loud annoying music, and that meeting will be spoiled. <br><br><h3>  A laptop </h3><br>  Maybe you need a computer to show the client some previous results or, say, to evaluate the work of certain interface elements in action.  However, try to spend less time on the computer, otherwise you risk getting stuck and moving away from a constructive, clear conversation.  Use the computer only in question-answer mode. <br><br><h2>  A meeting </h2><br><h3>  Where to begin? </h3><br>  Get an overview of the system.  What will do for whom is intended.  Ask the customer to clearly describe the system in two paragraphs, describe all users and roles.  Here's a tip that will help you: Imagine that the system is completely clean.  Who will be the first to enter information there?  What is this information?  How it will be there to make? <br><br><h3>  How to fix? </h3><br>  I personally try to use action lists and UML notation.  It is convenient, immediately structures information, it is easy to analyze and draw conclusions, and also to anticipate bottlenecks, which you should immediately pay attention to. <br><br>  I draw two types of diagrams: action diagrams and structural composite diagrams.  Also, if we discuss the interface, I try to make an outline of the interface and mark important points with colored pencils. <br><br>  Here is a small example, written according to the customer: <br><br>  <em>There are workers in the production department.</em>  <em>They compile the lists of equipment, fill in their properties and positions of the list.</em>  <em>And, by the way, they attach files to the list positions, well, you can make them in a pop-up window.</em> <br><br>  As a result, we get two diagrams.  One shows the actions of workers in the production department, the other is the relationship between entities. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/7e0/382/632/7e038263271e5f829c93efa8897f9220.png" width="450" height="68" alt="Class diagram (entity)" hspace="10" vspace="10"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/db4/d35/fc4/db4d35fc48e69adbb42a72986ef6429f.png" width="450" height="476" alt="Structural Composite Chart" hspace="10" vspace="10"><br><br>  Diagrams do not claim to be complete, they serve only as an example of documentation.  In addition, you can distribute the interface in blocks and figure out whether to make files in a pop-up window or not. <br><br><h3>  How to finish? </h3><br>  If you continue to work with the project, then after the meeting it is a good idea to transfer everything from paper to electronic form, at the same time to refresh and supplement. <br><br>  Results in the form of such diagrams, as well as possibly short stories (userstories), in the case of vague requirements, can be easily sent to the customer, no special knowledge is needed to read them. <br><br>  In fact, you have already saved a lot of time, because you laid the foundation for the future worthy and complete project documentation.  For such a detailed and illustrated technical task, you will be thanked not only by the customer, but also by future programmers. <br><br>  Interesting projects and successful discussions! <br><br>  <em>Original: <a href="http://www.steinzeig.ru/2007/12/09/rabota-s-zakazchikom-pervaya-vstrecha/">http://www.steinzeig.ru/2007/12/09/rabota-s-zakazchikom-pervaya-vstrecha/</a></em> <br></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/17627/">https://habr.com/ru/post/17627/</a></p>
