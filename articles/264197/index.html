  <section class="page js-page"><h1>HDD sled - cost effective grain</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The Westcomp team is pleased to welcome like-minded people at the country's largest IT resource.  The difficult economic times that have come will not make us stop loving IT.  We continue to develop our business and, as practice shows, we are especially useful now. <br>  The company sells used IT equipment from well-known brands such as HP, IBM, Dell, etc. <br>  There is a prejudice that in such a rapidly developing segment, how to buy IT B / Y means knowingly losing the competition.  Argue with this as it is difficult.  However, the case of each company is unique.  And now the time has come to think - is it so important to chase progress, if it is quite possible to solve current tasks with a smaller resource, with the same reliability. <br>  In this blog, we will post technical articles based on our practice of working with servers.  We will conduct comparative technical reviews of servers ‚Äúthrough generation‚Äù, for example HP G6 vs HP G8 and much more, noticed by experience over the years.  Sure, it will be interesting! <br>  Sincerely yours, Westcomp. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  <b>HDD sled - cost effective grain</b> </h4><br>  Modern server equipment entirely consists of quickly replaceable harmoniously working nodes.  In ensuring the continuity of its work, sooner or later there is a need for prevention or replacement of components.  Usually, due to budget constraints, this issue is very sensitive, because the cost saving mode is typical of most small and even medium-sized enterprises.  There are many ways to abandon the substantial costs of purchasing components, but such savings should be justified: without the risk of equipment failure or loss of information.  So, the most common and secure method to save the budget is to purchase a sled for HDD servers. <br>  Slides are baskets for hot-swappable server hard drives.  They are made for servers and storage systems of HP, IBM, Dell, Sun and even Supermicro - of all models and generations, having two types of form factor: 2.5 "and 3.5". <cut><br><br><h6><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/542/53a/1b3/54253a1b35384acb980f088ab4e6126e.jpeg"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ef8/bcb/a85/ef8bcba85df54ea2810e763a4c815097.jpeg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/72e/804/ca6/72e804ca6e68416f8b0f761e1c696dc5.jpeg"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/369/c9a/fb0/369c9afb07264880b7ee1c88eaf2f035.jpeg"><br></h6>

      Server manufacturers themselves do not sell separately HDD slides, but implement them only together with disks at an inflated price.  The thing is that they do not have their own production of hard drives, but only put their firmware on Seagate, Fujitsu and Western Digital discs, stamping on them recommender stickers with their own logo.  Only here the price of such a "quality mark" exceeds the cost of the HDD itself, that is, we pay the vendor for the originality of the part 100 - 150%.  Thus, the price of hard drives, for example, from Seagate, is more than 2 times less than the same ‚Äúoriginal‚Äù with HP, IBM, Dell and other nameplates. Yes, indeed, proprietary disks are determined by the server without any problems without any inconsistency signals , and this is a definite plus.  But the overpayment for this small "plus" is too substantial. <cut><br>  Also, this kind of savings deprives the buyer of the vendor warranty.  Is this important?  It is unlikely, since the warranty of the manufacturer of HDD, which is no worse, has not been canceled, as well as the warranty on the server using non-original disks, despite some prejudices.  If there is no difference, why pay more? <br>  Often in certain circles there is a stereotypical point of view that such tricks with a sled and ‚Äúnon-original‚Äù HDD are an exclusively Russian notion, arising from poverty and ‚Äúkulibinism‚Äù characteristic of our man.  This is fundamentally not the right idea.  Dispel this myth can easily known online auction eBay.  Sled - the most common selling goods abroad.  In the USA and in Western Europe, the server market is filled with skids, let alone China, India and other countries. <br><cut><br>  Guided by the results of an active 5-year practice of working with real buyers of the server sled, WestComp can provide sales statistics for this product: on average, it takes 500 copies per month.  At the same time for all the time there was not a single case of return of goods through the MoneyBack system.  On the contrary, there is a base of regular customers, which continues to grow. <br>  In this case, with the purchase of "original" hard drives, double overpayment goes not even for a brand, nor for higher quality, but just for a sticker with approval from the manufacturer of server hardware - that's all!  In the case of a limited budget, such expenditure of funds is highly impractical.  A rational grain and a critical approach should always be present in a purchase of this kind: are the ‚Äúoriginal‚Äù server hard drives really original?  In any case, the real savings are assigned to the sled, and the final choice - to the buyer. </cut></cut></cut></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/264197/">https://habr.com/ru/post/264197/</a></p>
