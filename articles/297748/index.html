For two weeks (taking into account the temporary period until January 3), customers spent a record amount on applications and in-app purchases in the Apple online store, which amounted to $ 1.1 billion. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  New Year's holidays are an important period for many stores, and the App Store is no exception, as it is on these days there are huge sales of the iPhone and iPad, and, consequently, growth in sales of applications.  The first day of this year was the most profitable day in the entire history of the App Store.  On the first day of the year, online store customers spent $ 144 million.  This amount exceeded the previous record, which took place only a few days earlier - December 25 (Catholic Christmas). <br><br>  According to information from representatives of Apple, the whole of 2015 brought the popular online store sales worth more than $ 20 billion, which is a quarter more than the year before last (then the figure was $ 15 billion).  This means that Apple itself received 6 billion in 2015. Not surprisingly, games like Minecraft and Clash of Clans, as well as applications like Netflix and Hulu, were the most popular among buyers.

      This, of course, is a good sign for Apple, because the company receives a third of all sales made on the App Store (30 cents from one dollar).  However, the company focuses on the fact that the App Store is a profitable platform for developers, stressing that since 2008 (which was the year the online store was launched), the company has helped developers earn $ 40 billion and has contributed to the creation of new jobs.  According to information from Apple, in the US alone, thanks to the company, 1.9 million jobs were created. <br><br>  Successful New Year sales could lead to an increase in the supply of apple products, which in turn would have a beneficial effect on Chinese suppliers, thereby minimizing the impact of the crisis that arose on the eve of holidays due to the fall in Apple's iPhone parts orders, which we already <a href="http://megamozg.ru/post/23140/">wrote about</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/297748/">https://habr.com/ru/post/297748/</a></p>
