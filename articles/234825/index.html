  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Nice to meet you. Custom</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Let me introduce myself: we are the CUSTIS team.  We live and work in Moscow, in a cozy office on Lesnaya Street.  Now there are just over 200 people in the company, classy specialists, open-minded, ambitious and passionate about their work. <br><br>  What exactly are we doing?  We design, develop and implement large corporate accounting and analytical systems for banks, retail chains and state-owned companies.  We create custom-made IT systems, precisely ‚Äúby the standards‚Äù of a particular client company.  And we spend almost all their life with them, from a flipchart with conceptual schemes after negotiations with the customer to duty in the Beijing office of a large trading network where one of our systems is being implemented. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  If we talk about the technologies we use, then, as one of our leading developers says, ‚Äúwe write on everything that burns‚Äù.  And from the most "burning" - Enterprise Java, .NET and Oracle.  Yes, we are engaged in harsh enterprise development, but there is also a place for experimentation and the opportunity to try something new, so we have solutions in the field of Big Data, non-relational repositories and mobile applications.  However, the technological details - in future posts. <br><br>  As another of ours, the lead developer, says, ‚Äúworking as a programmer is not just writing code‚Äù, so it would be unfair not to touch on important and favorite activities beyond the actual development - for example, our seminars in which we share the light of knowledge both within teams , and with students and young professionals.  And also - speeches at conferences and forums and various leisure activities: Friday gatherings, incendiary corporate parties and teambuildings, joint excursions on excursions and sports grounds.

      And, like any social community, we live according to our special principles and will follow them on Habr√©.  In the most brief presentation of them three. <br><br><ol><li>  <b>The best we have is people.</b>  We always thought so, think and will think.  We highly appreciate our specialists, we are proud of them and we trust them, therefore this blog will be run by the company's professional community, and not by a dedicated PR or corporate communications specialist. </li><li>  <b>We love and know how to share knowledge.</b>  Our company has always willingly passed on its knowledge and expertise to those to whom it can be useful - customers, industry colleagues and related areas and, of course, employees.  The same principle lies at the very core of Habrahabr, so we hope that here we will be at ease. </li><li>  <b>We strive to develop together.</b>  We believe that the present development can only be joint: making a project for a client, reading an open seminar, publishing interviews with an expert - we develop ourselves and develop the environment around us.  Clients, partners, specialists, information space in general.  We see our mission in this and we will try to grow and develop on Habr√© together with an audience that is critical, persistent and not tolerant of compromises - in general, ideally suitable. </li></ol><br>  We also appreciate quality content and do not strive to write on ‚Äútopical‚Äù, ‚Äútrend‚Äù and ‚Äúrelevant‚Äù topics, we respect the audience and our specialists, therefore it is interesting and thorough about ours.  And we will be happy if it becomes our, common. <br><br>  Welcome and we will be familiar! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/234825/">https://habr.com/ru/post/234825/</a></p>
