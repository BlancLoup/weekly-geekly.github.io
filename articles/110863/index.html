Sometimes in a good way, and sometimes in a bad way.  What is characteristic in both cases - does not reach all. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Some begin to worry a lot about ‚ÄúI'm so good, how could they do this to me.‚Äù  Some start to feel sorry for themselves, but it‚Äôs better not to get carried away, because self-pity is the path to inadequacy. <br>  Moral injuries of course remain, yes.  But in order for events to truly become an experience, they must be considered as a chain of facts and cause-effect relationships. <br><br>  Here are examples of some acute situations from my life.  The experience gained in them was and remains useful to this day.  As you read, think for yourself how you would behave (1) in the place of my leader, (2) in my place. <br><br><h4>  I am the head of the department responsible for all CAD systems in the enterprise. </h4><br><blockquote>  There is an old and old trick of autocratic rule. <br>  Good must feel guilty. <br>  A sense of failure begins with guilt. <br>  A good autocrat creates many possibilities. <br>  so that people feel like losers.

      "Children of the Dune", Frank Herbert </blockquote><br>  My boss doesn‚Äôt understand much about CAD, moreover, he doesn‚Äôt even know how to work on a computer for 70 years.  He started working at the enterprise even before my birth.  Owns only authoritarian management style.  He does not trust me, imposes his ‚Äúvision‚Äù of the issue, controls and criticizes trifles.  Criticism is mainly in the style of ‚Äúthis is wrong,‚Äù deviating from specific answers to the questions ‚Äúand how would it be more correct?‚Äù <br>  Criticizes for the flaws and lack of results a lot, with gusto and humor, but mostly politely.  He does this both individually, and in the presence of my subordinates, and in the presence of other department heads, and at the general meetings of the department, often repeatedly. <br><br>  Total: <br>  1 year I worked on the principle of "I will do what I can."  Checked the boundaries of the slogan "a good manager will perform his task in any conditions."  I achieved certain results, but I could not build normal relations with my boss. <br>  Gone under the weight of the feeling that in other conditions would have reached 5 times more in the same time. <br>  Then they told me that the CEO at a meeting of company executives said that he would never forgive my boss for my departure.  His department was partially disbanded, some of his projects were taken from him.  The situation with what my department was doing at the enterprise, some heads of other departments began to describe with the words ‚Äúyou left and the mess started again‚Äù. <br><br><h4>  I am the head of a large development department </h4><br><blockquote>  VALUE: Just because you are needed does not mean that you are important. <br><br>  <a href="">Demotivator</a> </blockquote><br>  My boss has been successfully responsible for the commercial part of our department for a couple of years.  She is younger than me, financial education, in character and style, a typical "girl from the sales department."  Relationships are not glued right from the start. <br>  Mostly I try to avoid clear answers to my questions about strategic objectives and criteria for evaluating my work.  Practically does not control me / my work, but does not interfere.  But at the same time, if someone else bothers me or there is a problem, sometimes it does not help at all.  It does not help at all to resolve conflicts at the firm level, does not protect my interests.  If problems arise with her - substitutes me. <br><br>  Total: <br>  He worked for a year and a half, concentrating fully on achieving concrete results in his work.  He achieved a lot, but not much of what he dreamed.  Political squabbles and other injustices within the firm usually had to be tolerated. <br>  After I left, my department quickly lost many key employees. <br><br><h4>  I am a project manager </h4><br><blockquote>  Do not think that I do not like the military. <br>  I deeply respect the feat of the people <br>  lost their minds in the service of the motherland. <br><br>  Thinking out loud </blockquote><br>  I, from the first day of work in the firm, have been entrusted with the task of <a href="">saving the project</a> , the head of which quit without practically starting the main part of the design work.  The backlog from the planned start date of work is 4-6 months (depending on how you evaluate the work done).  No approved project team. <br>  My boss is a former military man, a senior submarine officer.  Well versed in the regulations of work with military customers and in the relevant regulatory documentation.  In management understands poorly, in software development - even worse.  By nature, he is a very pronounced excitable type, and, due to the specifics of the company, no one ‚Äúcorrected‚Äù. <br>  Allows himself to scream at me, even in the presence of other colleagues, some of whom are my subordinates. <br><br>  Total: <br>  After the first week of work, I realized that I would not stay long in this company.  But so quickly change jobs can be both difficult and ugly.  The project passed almost on time, but without me.  The company still exists, and live people work in it! <br><br><h4>  Instead of output </h4><br><blockquote>  In the field of software development, there are non-technical managers <br>  and those who have technical experience, but 10 years behind the life. <br>  Technically competent, technically modern managers are rare. <br>  If you work with such, do everything to save your work. <br>  This is an extraordinary luck. <br><br>  ‚ÄúPerfect Code‚Äù by Steve McConnell </blockquote><br>  I agree completely, but I will add that this quotation will remain fair even if you everywhere throw out the word ‚Äútechnical‚Äù. <br><br>  Extraordinary luck. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/110863/">https://habr.com/ru/post/110863/</a></p>
