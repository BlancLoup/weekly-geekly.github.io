Now in GetIntent DSP there are additionally available about 400 million video hits of multi-roll and content-roll formats.  Videonow is a strategic partner for IMHO VI, the largest Russian salesperson in video network management. <br><br>  On the occasion of the partnership, we talked with Ilya Shatalov, commercial director of Videonow, about the industry and gathered in this material his understanding and vision of the current situation on the market programmatic video. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  ‚ÄúRecently, we are seeing an increase in advertiser interest in the use of new technologies, opportunities for working with the date, as well as in evaluating and measuring the effectiveness of the work of the Republic of Kazakhstan.  Already few who want to buy certain sites using classic media planning.  More and more players tend to automate the entire process of working with the audience.  We can say that they want to buy a certain territory and a specific user, thereby increasing the value of advertising, creating a much better quality contact for themselves.

      There are really interesting advertisers with complex tasks that they could solve before, but it was not possible to control the result.  And now the market requires, he wants to work in the same window with the entire video, as far as possible, use more leverage to optimize the quality of traffic.  Accordingly, this is an absolutely harmonious trend in advertising, and we could not get past it.  The best solution was to search for external partners.  Today we work with companies that post programmatic videos, use In-Stream, In-Article, In-Read formats.  We are engaged in the monetization of both dekstopnogo and mobile equipment.  One of the partners was GetIntent, and it turned out that we were able to close all relevant issues at once. ‚Äù <br><br><hr><br>  ‚ÄúCustomers who work with image advertising are focused on coverage.  Many of them use programmatic as a cheap way to purchase video inventory, and create coverage.  That is, those volumes that they could not get from other sources and through other channels get programmatic placement. <br><br>  By doing so, purchasing often private, non-public inventory customers receive maximum coverage.  It is hard to call it programmatic in its pure form, it‚Äôs just the additional purchase of cheap inventory - the ‚Äúwe want a lot and cheap‚Äù approach.  For us, this is a conditional programmatic. ‚Äù <br><br><hr><br>  ‚ÄúBy‚Äú real ‚Äùquality programmatic, we mean thoughtful and serious work with the audience, with data, with behavioral technologies - these are the elements that together give an accurate picture of the user in order to show him the most relevant advertising. <br><br>  In this we see the programmatic strengths, it is in this direction that it must develop, increasing the cost of advertising, increasing the income of publishers and benefiting everyone, especially the advertiser. <br><br>  It is very important to understand that cheap does not happen well: technologies, data, the purchase of this data, sampling - everything has a certain cost.  Accordingly, the result is improved, the quality of contact with the user improves. ‚Äù <br><br><hr><br>  ‚ÄúOn the one hand, for us, as for SSP, the main task is to maximize the revenue of each site, each publisher individually and the network as a whole.  On the other hand, we are responsible for the inventory, for the traffic that we have from the sites.  Inventory and traffic should be efficiently distributed.  This task is solved by placing inventory at a public auction.  We strive for absolute occupancy, but at the same time we try to keep the highest price on the principle of sales funnel. ‚Äù <br><br><hr><br>  ‚ÄúOf course, we are pleased with the additional procurement of traffic - no site will refuse additional profits.  But first of all, programmatic is the technology of working with the audience.  Thanks to programmatic, we see advertisers appearing with interesting and challenging tasks that they could have done before, but could not control it.  Our technologies allow you to get maximum data and evaluate the result.  As a result, the advertiser gets the contact an order of magnitude better, and the site gets more money.  Everyone is happy.  And we believe that this is the right development of the market. ‚Äù <br><br><hr><br>  ‚ÄúOf course, there are difficulties, as in any market.  There are a lot of DSP companies in the market, which, simply, according to our suspicions, do not have their own technology ... There are either one-day or half-one-day projects that are engaged in coming to the agency, to advertisers and trying to sell very cheaply, thereby creating competition in the market.  Of course, this situation does not benefit the market as a whole.  This is the problem of growth that we are seeing today; this is probably a natural difficulty.  The market will evolve according to the principle of natural selection, that is, only those programmatic platforms that have their own sets of tools and data acquisition technologies will survive. ‚Äù <br><br>  ‚ÄúWe chose GetIntent, as this is a company with a transparent history, an international company with its own technologies, a wide partner network of data providers.  For us, we absolutely transparently see your manufacturability, your usefulness for the market, therefore we are very happy to provide you with our inventory, ‚Äùcomments Ilya Shatalov, commercial director of Videonow. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/307404/">https://habr.com/ru/post/307404/</a></p>
