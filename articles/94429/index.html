      Imagine skills like bricks.  Acquisition of each of them is relatively simple and fast (although it can make you swear hard in the process). <br><br>  Imagine knowledge as a foundation. <br><br>  Can you scatter bricks along the beach?  You can. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/d2c/f45/cd3/d2cf45cd333c5650784ffae8c0aa251c.jpg" title="Photo from http://www.liveinternet.ru/users/721411/, by Ytsuken Fyvap"><br><br>  This is what knowledge of a beginner enikeyschik or just a computer user looks like.  In some places, the bricks even overlap each other and form a handful of 2-3 bricks high.  This is an experienced user who knows how to install drivers, how to clean the registry and optimize performance. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Experience grows, skills grow.  Piles of brick in some places begin to reach the height of human growth.  This experienced already-non-enikeyschik-and-almost-admin "knows everything" about desktop Windows (although the very first couple of questions about local security policies will plunge him into a stupor).  He has a decent pile of unsystematized bricks in one or two areas, the germs of future specialization.  As work progresses, piles of bricks appear in other areas unrelated to the first.  (following the outline of enikii: pulling out the SCS, setting up a PBX, playing a dud, updating the 1C configuration, artistic overclocking, installing video surveillance, fire alarms, setting Skype, pressing any key, etc.). <br><br>  Heaps are growing.  But still remain heaps.  Which can continue to grow, but every new dozen centimeters height is given a greater and greater price, as the bricks have to pile on evenly and horizontally. <br><br>  Attempting to lay out these bricks in a slender structure stumbles upon a problem: the structure does not hold without a foundation, and instead of a slender wall, it strives to again take the form of a heap. <br><br>  Building a foundation is hard and does not give any competitive advantages - the pile of bricks from the foundation does not become higher, rather, even, on the contrary, at the beginning, if the bricks are packed tightly, then they are visually smaller than in a disorderly pile. <br><br>  Moreover, the construction of the foundation leads to a terrible situation: bricks can be laid out only where there is a foundation!  It is no longer possible to scatter them anywhere - because there is sand, and there is no support at all.  More precisely, you can scatter anywhere, but you can effectively fold them only where there is a foundation. <br><br>  And digging a foundation is harder than hauling bricks.  Longer, ungrateful.  And man, of course, begins to try to lay bricks where the foundation is. <br><br>  And suddenly, its wall is half a brick in size, it turns out to be above the mature piles of brick around.  It seems, and not a lot of bricks - and above.  Try to lay this down without a foundation - it will collapse. <br><br>  ... Man begins to build higher and higher, but it turns out that the foundation is small.  It is too weak, and you need to make it bigger, deeper, wider, capturing the neighboring areas.  [Here, my analogy is lame, it will not be possible to finish the foundation for a semi-built building, but you can completely get knowledge for skills]. <br><br>  And so, the person begins to expand the foundation.  Hard, ungrateful work.  The deeper you dig in, the more difficult (because at a depth of 5 cm the whole city is littered with books "Foundations for Dummies in 24 hours", to a depth of 50 cm - there are some good thick textbooks, to a depth of a meter - a couple of unfinished manuals and several monographs in scientific journals, and then there only on their own ...).  But, on this foundation it is already possible to build a huge height and complexity of the building.  Perhaps there are no more bricks in them than in the piles around, but how it is laid, how it stands, makes this particular brick much higher and more functional than just a pile of skills ... <br><br>  A person at any time can begin to build in a new place.  Attach a single-storey hut with its main building, or shift the entire center of knowledge to a new point.  Or maybe, in general, to build a separate house (I administer tsiski and dzhunipery, and I also know how to solder well, and I understand quite well in radio electronics). <br><br>  The ‚Äúmulti-armed Shiva‚Äù syndrome is when you put bricks wherever the boss said, or where the wind moved the tumbleweed fields of life.  Today there are only heaps, tomorrow others ... For a more or less decent pile of bricks in the new place, you have to carry a lot of hands, folding the heaps again and again.  Sometimes the old heaps come in handy, but for that ‚Äúmany-armed Shiva‚Äù and many-handed, he has a lot of heaps, and you need more and more of them. <br><br>  But heaps will never grow taller, in fact, heaps, until there is a foundation, until there is a clear aspiration upwards and a willingness to put skills in a certain system, which has foundations, and emptiness, and bearing, and even decorative walls.  At the same time paying for the bricks in the right place and in the right form.  But putting bricks in the right and precise form on the top of the pile is much more difficult than on the next floor of its own building. <br><br>  The only way to build your building is to make a foundation.  In his free time, in his free time, using all the possibilities to get not only the next brick in the resume, but also not very prominent, but very important millimeter of concrete into the foundation. <br><br>  Faced with the technology, you need to either ‚Äúbypass it to the minimum‚Äù (set up the PBX and forget it), or dig into it to the maximum.  What, why, how ... And why exactly?  And in what standard is it written?  And what else is written in this standard?  And what does this look like in practice?  Are there any more similar standards?  And non-standard solutions?  And what is the motivation of the standard, what is it based on?  And why in this theory relies that way and not otherwise? <br><br>  Any topic you can dig "to the bottom."  Of course, not on any topic there is time, strength.  But there should be at least some systemically covered areas in which there is a foundation and understanding of "from and to".  Otherwise - all my life bricks in heaps. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/94429/">https://habr.com/ru/post/94429/</a></p>
