  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Bluetooth Stereo Headset from Dadget</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Convenience associated with the lack of wires has long attracted all gadget lovers.  Headphones with occasions are good while you sit in order to listen to music.  When moving or just doing something, the wire constantly strives to cling to hands or surrounding objects. <br>  We got rid of the wire, but here another question arises - what to do if the phone rings?  And for this to the headphones must be a microphone and control buttons. <br>  In general, the picture is clear, the word for a specific implementation of the problem.  (Recall how the implementation of smart watches was assumed a long time ago :) <iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/UXbfqhdpppI%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700023,15700186,15700190,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhjOHeQ-kWS0cJwYKHg2UBmz_OWeGA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>  ) <br><br>  In this review, the <a href="https://dadget.ru/katalog/multimedia/wireless-headphones/%3Futm_referrer%3Dgeektimes.ru%26utm_source%3Dgeektimes.ru%26utm_medium%3Darticle%26utm_term%3Dwireless-headphones%26utm_content%3Dwireless-headphones%26utm_campaign%3Dwireless-headphones_186">bluetooth stereo headset FB0035 from the company Dadzhet</a> will be tested for compliance with expectations. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Let's start with the kit. <br>  Beautiful green transparent packaging.

      Now in order.  Let's start with the characteristics stated by the manufacturer. <br>  1. Bluetooth version: 4.1 + EDR.  They connected to the smartphone without problems, but there is a nuance - when you first connect, you need to hold down and hold a large square button, otherwise the headphones will not be detected.  By the way, this is not written in the manual and it is not easy to guess right away. <br>  2. The battery life is 6-8 hours.  I'm just not able to listen to music for 6 hours, and I charge my headphones from time to time, so they have never sat down.  I think there are 6 hours :) <br>  3. Charging time up to 2 hours. <br>  4. Range (indoors) - up to 10 meters.  I would say ‚Äúwithout obstacles‚Äù, because the connection is not stable through the supporting w / b wall. <br>  5. Built-in microphone and volume control.  And switching between tracks and answering a call. <br>  6. On indication, indication of battery discharge, voice notification of on and off.  The notification is loud ... LOUDLY informs about his intentions, so if you listen to music quietly, then you may be surprised and scared;) <br>  7. Resistance 16 Ohm, frequency 20 Hz ~ 20 kHz. <br><br>  What are dry facts to us?  We charge, put on and forward to field trials! <br>  1. Ergonomics. <br>  In the ears sit well, keep well with attachments.  Without nozzles strive to fall out - affects the mass of the built-in battery and the rest of the filling. <br>  On the right earpiece is located the bottom of the microUSB connector.  There is also a LED that blinks happily in blue to everyone around you that you are connected to music. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/eb1/b2b/20e/eb1b2b20eca84ffba1cae25313bafc45.JPG"><br>  Replaceable liners no.  I came up with regular earbuds, but there is something to buy or take off from other headphones. <br>  Unfortunately, the dimensions of the headphones do not allow the use of headgear covering their ears.  So in the winter it will be necessary to look for something more suitable. <br>  The control panel under the right hand, thin flat wire thrown back and does not cling to clothes.  Everything is good. <br>  Headphones dimensions are a little confusing - at first it seems that they can catch on with something nearby :) <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d40/d0c/a63/d40d0ca63394464b8fced57c4976c265.JPG"><br><br>  2. Sound. <br>  The music is not the highest quality (music lovers are back in flight), which would be strange to expect from such an inexpensive model, but it is pleasant to listen.  Audiobooks and radio plays do not cause any complaints, and the headphones I use most often to listen to the voice. <br>  The volume reserve is large and you don‚Äôt have to push it to the maximum even in the noisiest places like the metro.  Noise isolation is good, so be careful - it is better not to use when traveling on a bicycle or in places where it is important to hear the surrounding space! <br><br>  3. Headset. <br>  Here is a small bummer.  It is difficult to use it in noisy places, it is necessary to constantly hold the microphone near the mouth.  The only plus is that there is no need to climb the pocket in the phone. <br>  Even in quiet places when walking, it is better to hold the microphone with your hand, otherwise the effect of approaching the deletion of the voice appears. <br><br><h1>  findings </h1><br>  Pros: <br>  - Lack of wires <br>  - Good workmanship <br>  - Acceptable sound quality <br>  Minuses: <br>  - No interchangeable nozzles <br>  - Large and heavy body <br>  - Loud voice prompts <br>  - The microphone is not for noisy places. <br><br>  In general - for my money is quite good. <br>  Headphone style sports, youth, but not business.  Headphones fit more for young people, for those who like to listen to music without being distracted from work.  You do not need to get the phone. <br>  The absence of wires - this is comfort as not cool! <br><br>  <a href="https://dadget.ru/katalog/multimedia/wireless-headphones/%3Futm_referrer%3Dgeektimes.ru%26utm_source%3Dgeektimes.ru%26utm_medium%3Darticle%26utm_term%3Dwireless-headphones%26utm_content%3Dwireless-headphones%26utm_campaign%3Dwireless-headphones_186">Readers of the site have the opportunity to purchase "Wireless headphones" with a 10% discount, using the code GEEKT-NAUSHBP, which is valid 14 days from the date of publication of this article.</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/393005/">https://habr.com/ru/post/393005/</a></p>
