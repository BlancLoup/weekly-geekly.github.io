I mean the question of how our perception of the world is developing.  We studied according to one textbook, we walked in the same clothes.  Our parents were average physicians, teachers, and vendors.  School, courtyard, sports sections and various clubs and ... In this publication I will try to tell about one huge layer of my childhood - the game Dendy.  To tell about the role that this miracle of the 90s had on me. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  <b>Dizzy - project management</b> <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/7a8/911/d53/7a8911d535ec4695b87711be4f6db6e7.PNG"></div><br>  We took cartridges with games for rent in salons, leaving the parents passport as a deposit.  To become the proud owner of a popular game for a day, it was necessary to enroll in a queue in the logbook of the owner of the salon.  Once, on an almost empty shelf, I noticed an unpopular orange box labeled ‚ÄúDizzy‚Äù.  And this game has become my favorite.  Thanks to her, I learned what I could not learn even at school.

      Your task is to collect artifacts, change them to other things.  Classic graphic quest.  You can only carry three things.  The order of transfer and exchange is important.  There was no saving of games then.  And each time, starting anew, it was necessary to remember what and where to carry, the order of transfer.  And it took precious time.  Then I added one more to my school notebooks and began to draw the order of assembling artifacts. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/4e5/a96/a02/4e5a96a02fef4fac98b261056ded14a9.PNG"></div><br><br>  Project managers, what does that remind you of?  No one among my friends had such an approach to the passage of this game. <br><br>  I still wonder why some of my employees and colleagues do not understand simple things in project planning and management.  I did not pass the game.  There was never enough time.  I downloaded a emulator on a PC a couple of years ago.  Now it is possible to remain, and the father will no longer pull out the plug of the b / w TV.  But so far he has not realized his old childhood dream - to collect all the stars in this beautiful game.  Maybe for the better. <br><br>  <b>Chip and Dale - Teamwork</b> <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/cc2/056/fff/cc2056fff54b454193d53393e00a9956.PNG"></div><br><br>  This game was a great way to learn how to work in a team.  In childhood, I already learned to divide people according to various characteristics / abilities.  In this game, companions for me were divided into three categories.  They play better than me, worse than me and like me. <br><br>  <i>Better than me</i> .  You play the game, you are constantly at the left end of the screen.  Do not have time for the leader.  He forwards you to collect all lives and does more damage to the main boss.  You start to notice his moves, jumps.  Constantly learn from him.  And be sure to look for an opportunity to sit down with him for a nearby joystick. <br><br>  <i>Worse than me</i>  You leave him a life, because you and so, with one you can pass the whole game.  Grab it, carry it and jump over difficult places.  You show him safe places in the battle with the boss. <br><br>  <i>Like me</i> .  This is the most interesting.  Here we come up with a wonderful option.  We need to go to the end of the game, while messing with each other.  Grab each other and throw at enemies, when moving up the map, do not wait for your partner and leave him in the screen abyss.  It developed maximum agility. <br><br>  It was then that I realized that all people are different and the approach to them must be individualized, since you happened to play in a team.  A lot of time has passed, now working in a team and managing people, I always select individual methods of working with a person and never row with the same comb.  And now, what do you think, with whom is it most interesting to cooperate / work in business, who is worse than you, is better or like you? <br><br>  <b>Race America - self control</b> <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e08/d9f/bd2/e08d9fbd21044b9b9916dd1a962ad080.PNG"></div><br><br>  Waiting for my turn at the joystick, I, in order to pass the time, watched not only the TV, but also the players.  You, probably, also noticed that many players, playing various races, moved with their whole body behind a virtual machine / motorcycle.  You can even compare with playing pianists.  You look at them and it seems that they live life together with the performed work.  But I had a different approach.  I began to control every move.  Comfortable posture and no swinging.  The buildup.  In athletics, this rule was hammered into us.  There should be no movement from side to side when running - a waste of energy and the wrong flow of thoughts.  I accepted the pose of a monk whenever I wanted to be a better player. <br><br>  Have you heard about non-verbal communication?  People constantly read you and give you signs themselves.  In any stressful situation, take my favorite pose - "racing monk."  And then you will often come out the winner after any business negotiations.  Ask for wage increases, get a job, quit, listen to criticism or criticize yourself - no swinging. <br><br>  <b>Epilogue</b> <br><br>  After graduation, I no longer played on such a scale as in childhood.  As a student, I got a little acquainted with Warcraft and a couple more games.  And now I'm generally far from the gaming industry.  I have my own children.  My three-year-old daughter handles the smartphone better than her grandfather with a push-button telephone.  That same grandfather, my dad, who told me - ‚ÄúDo not shoot an electronic gun, plant a kinescope,‚Äù but who secretly gave me your passport from my mom so that I could take the coveted color cartridge of the sun for rent. <br><br>  I do not know if my daughter will ever write about what the games taught her.  Does she see in them what I saw when I was small, and what she sees besides colorful sprites.  No matter how, but I will definitely give her a portion of the sun. <br><br>  <b>Ps</b> <br><br>  We have some guys smoked from the first class.  When someone was going to play in the apartment, a whole queue of games was lined up.  And some people wanted to smoke so much that they had to miss their chance to defeat Tolstosum.  I have never smoked and never smoke in my life.  And I do not advise you. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/327552/">https://habr.com/ru/post/327552/</a></p>
