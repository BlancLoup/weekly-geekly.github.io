If you take Tesla cars, they are both <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/post/190912/">safe</a> (much safer than regular cars with ICE), and eco-friendly (incorrect but fashionable term, yes), plus they can be charged for free at some gas stations.  In the future, as certain business representatives and supporters of electric cars are convinced, the whole world will switch to electric cars. <br><br>  But there may be a <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41560-017-0074-z">problem</a> .  The fact is that not all electrical networks can withstand such loads.  We all at least once got into a situation when electrical appliances included in the home network caused a power outage.  The network simply could not withstand the simultaneous operation of the washing machine, microwave, heating devices and even a couple of small things.  The same thing, only on a larger scale and with some reservations, can happen if everyone starts switching to electric cars. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  In general, while this problem threatens only those regions where citizens are accustomed to private cars and often have not one, but two or three cars per family.  Matteo Muratori, a researcher at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (Colorado, USA) made some calculations that made it clear that modern power grids are not very adapted to the dominance of electric vehicles.  If such machines spread rapidly, then in some regions there may be problems with energy supply.

      In a study, Muratori <a href="https://www.nrel.gov/news/press/2018/nrel_research_determines_integration_of_electric_vehicles.html">estimated the</a> proportion of electric vehicles in their total volume in different regions from 3 percent to 100 percent.  In the United States, for example, this <a href="https://www.iea.org/publications/freepublications/publication/GlobalEVOutlook2017.pdf">figure is less</a> and amounts to only 0.9%.  But this is "the average temperature in the hospital."  If we take a smaller scale, we will see that in some regions of the country there are more electric vehicles than in all other regions.  Particularly relevant is the problem of damage to electrical networks for electric vehicles that are charged using a ‚Äúfast‚Äù charging station. <br><br>  Muratori emulated changes in electricity demand for different states of America.  For his work, he used data that can be obtained in the public domain.  In addition, he decided to conduct the study "live".  So, he chose 200 households, which accounted for a total of 248 cars.  In general, if, say, a quarter of electric vehicles are replaced with electric cars, nothing terrible will happen, although the power consumption of the region will be higher with them than everywhere else. <br><br>  True, the moment when the owners of electric cars will not start to use all the fast charging polls.  This is very convenient, because you do not need to wait next to an electric car for many hours while it is charged.  But more energy is required. <br><br>  The scientist calculated the changes that can occur if the owners of electric vehicles will use such charging stations.  As it turned out, the problem is really relevant - this is not fiction.  Even more, it is revealed, if we take a smaller scale - say, only six households with 12 electric cars.  As long as electric cars will be charged in the usual way, problems will not arise.  But if all drivers use fast charges, the blackouts will begin. <br><br>  According <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2018/01/how-many-electric-cars-can-the-grid-take-depends-on-your-neighborhood/">to the scientist</a> , the problem can be solved if electric cars are not charged all together, but separately, according to a certain plan.  For example, this house charges its cars from 11 to 15, and the other from 15:00 to 21:00.  In addition, the scientist believes that you can use smart charging stations that can adapt the energy consumption for each electric vehicle. <br><br>  The same scientist says that the wide distribution of electric cars can be problematic only at first, until the infrastructure is adapted for charging electric vehicles.  Over time, everything will be changed and adapted, so that no one will notice any inconvenience.  True, up to this point is still a long time, so that the government and citizens of areas where there are a lot of electric vehicles, if there is every chance to talk and find points of contact. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/374191/">https://habr.com/ru/post/374191/</a></p>
