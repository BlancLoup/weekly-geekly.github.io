  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Mac OS and HTML Coding Software</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Honestly, this is not a review at all, but a brief description of the problems I encountered when choosing a text editor for typesetting under Makos. <br><br>  Under Windows, as I can remember, the layout of the sites was done in <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Notepad%252B%252B">Notepad ++</a> and, in general, I did not know grief - I hung it up on F4 in TotalCommander, I went to FTP or locally, I edited and saved the file.  To be honest, I had suspicions that somehow it was not at all effective that the work was done with this opened-edited-saved-opened ... but did not know the alternatives and did not search. <br><br>  After I collected Gentoo on my desktop, I first tried to use the same Notepad ++ for wine, but something went wrong for me and after some searches I discovered the wonderful editor <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quanta_Plus">Quanta Plus</a> (strange, well, what a crafter for developers to these advantages).  I must say, the editor of the proto-I conquered and spoiled once and for all.  To return after him to tools like Notepad ++ is absolutely impossible.  Of course, I certainly didn‚Äôt have time to study all his chips, but I learned some things after the first launches and remained in love with them to this day.  What exactly won out - working with projects, fine-tuning the type of indents (the width of the tab can be set not in some conditional units on the screen, but in the spaces, which, for example, is important when imposing in HAML), built-in work with FTP (ie, there is no such opened-nd-saved-opened- now only save and ready, edit further) and, most importantly, autocomplete (guys ... I have never met such an autocomplex, and I think I‚Äôll never meet again).

      And then I switched on a Mac. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Inspired by the <a href="http://macradar.ru/software/texteditors">note</a> on <a href="http://macradar.ru/">MacRadar, I</a> immediately rushed to set myself a <a href="http://macromates.com/">Textmate</a> .  Even some chitshit found hotkeys for him.  I decided to try the editor in battle and immediately broke off ... Maybe I didn‚Äôt understand what was likely, but I couldn‚Äôt make Textmate friends with FTP.  Ie generally nothing.  According to the familiar Windows scheme, Textmate hung up on F4 in Disk Order and when I tried to open a file for editing, I received it in the program‚Äôs built-in editor, although local files in such a way are opened just fine.  I didn‚Äôt find any analogue to the Quanta projects in Textmate either ... I want to repeat, most likely I didn‚Äôt screw up or understand something, because in blog search people complain about another misfortune - they want to transcode the edited files into the proper encoding on the fly directly on FTP (another serious minus for me TextMate - our Russian folk win and koi encodings are not supported).  So, friends, if you have a moment - teach me, stupid, the intricacies of Textmate's international interaction with FTP ... <br><br>  In general, spat on Textmate and continued searching.  Presented in the same note, MacRadar <a href="http://www.barebones.com/products/textwrangler/index.shtml">TextWrangler was</a> dismissed immediately because of the problems already mentioned above with domestic encodings, without which it is difficult to live (we are bonded people, if we are using servers from win-1251, then we must).  I thought to drive Eclipse, Emacs or Aptana, but so far I decided that in my case using IDE would not be justified.  I‚Äôll find time to seriously deal with Rails - then yes, then such layouts can be used for layout, but for the time being, too, refused them. <br><br>  Whether long or short, he decided to unsubscribe <a href="http://pepelsbey.net/">Vadim Makeev</a> in private ( <a href="http://pepelsbey.habrahabr.ru/">tyk into</a> this worthy husband's <a href="http://pepelsbey.habrahabr.ru/">karma</a> ), who, in his time, was also looking for a good text editor for Makosi.  So it was he who advised me a wonderful tool, about which, actually, I wanted to write this note, but something spread out through memories and thoughts on the tree =]. <br><br>  So, the drum roll and <strong><a href="http://www.panic.com/coda/">Coda</a></strong> is the only and unique for me code editor under Mac OS X. Not only is the program functional, it is also incredibly beautiful.  Rarely, you know, mind and beauty are combined ... In the case - as promised from the very beginning, briefly =], the list of things I liked and didn‚Äôt like. <br><br>  <b>1. Projects or sessions</b> <br><img src="http://www.reactant.ru/wp-content/uploads/2007/11/4.png" alt="Coda"><br>  Without this, I guess I'm already nowhere.  Everything is compact and beautiful, and it can be customized as the external part of the site panel (for example, you can take a photo of your favorite boss, not to be distracted from work, and then reduce its size so that you don‚Äôt bother) and internal (you can immediately specify a bunch of parameters for sites For example, appearances and passwords for SSH, if suddenly the data differ from the data of the FTP account). <br>  What you didn‚Äôt like - you cannot open files of different projects in one window.  Not very convenient when HTML templates are on one server, and CSS - on the other (and it happens). <br><br>  <b>2. Direct work with files on FTP</b> <br>  It's all clear.  That option that I loved so much in Quanta. <br><br>  <b>3. Clips</b> <br><img src="http://www.reactant.ru/wp-content/uploads/2007/11/3.png" alt="3.png"><br>  Pre-prepared text blocks.  Well, in my case, these are some kind of comments for CSS files.  I have not figured out yet whether it is possible to hang these clips on hotkeys, if it were possible, there would be no price for them =] <br><br>  <b>4. Built-in terminal</b> <br>  At first glance, a completely unnecessary thing for a text editor, which in practice turned out to be very useful.  Well, for example, when I work, I‚Äôm impatient to transfer a large number of files from one daddy to another - it‚Äôs not a question, I‚Äôm connecting, I‚Äôm in command, and I‚Äôm wearing a hat, these are my files in the directory tree on the left. <br><br>  <b>5. Syntax highlight and autocomplete</b> <br>  If there is nothing to say about syntax highlighting, then there are some things in the local autocomplex that make it difficult to live.  Although it is possible to live, and this is most likely a matter of taste ... <br><br>  I want to finish this story with a solemn promise to buy a program, if nothing comes out of the Quanta Plus assembly under Makos (does not want to, understand, she‚Äôs going, since I have no KDE).  I will invite smart people to dance with bubunas and if Quanta rises, I will write here instructions for ritual dances.  Only now it is necessary to buy plastic, no pipe has anything provided for them.  Okay, somehow get out ... <br><br>  Orrriginal: <a href="http://www.reactant.ru/blog/mac-os-i-programmyi-dlya-html-verstki.html">http://www.reactant.ru/blog/mac-os-i-programmyi-dlya-html-verstki.html</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/15741/">https://habr.com/ru/post/15741/</a></p>
