With Mac OS I understood at random and google.  For solving some problems under Windows, I used VirtualBox and VMware Fusion.  Fusion suited me completely.  To write to NTFS, I purchased a driver from Paragon.  I can not consider myself a Mac expert.  But I like the laptop myself. <br><br>  Then one day, good friends asked me to put Windows on a Mac.

      Being well-read, I heard that there is a great opportunity to turn a Mac into a Windows laptop using the BootCamp program.  On the Internet, quite a step-by-step instructions on how to do this in half an hour.  I can not say that people are lying, but I did it a little differently. <br><br>  During the research, it turned out that problems with BootCamp arise from a fair amount of users.  I found part of the answers myself, part of them went and gathered them in one place, so that I could not forget myself, and maybe save time for others. <br><br>  BootCamp is very simple.  A piece is cut from the current disk partition and a new partition is created (with the name BootCamp), into which Windows is installed.  Thus, Windows will work directly on hardware, without virtualization, and therefore faster.  Mac OS does not disappear anywhere, but in order to return to it you need to overload the computer.  The merit of BootCamp is to prepare this process in the OS X environment. After that, you need to install Windows yourself. <br><br>  Windows can be installed independently, without BootCamp. <br>  But do not do this for no good reason.  Below I will explain why. <br><br>  First, I came across a MacBookAir 6.1 11-inch 2013. <br>  The newest of the MacBook Air at the moment. <br>  6.1 is the model number.  His knowledge is helpful in some cases. <br><br>  Here are the system requirements and information, how to find your laptop model: <br>  <a href="http://support.apple.com/kb/HT5634%3Fviewlocale%3Den_US">support.apple.com/kb/HT5634?viewlocale=en_US</a> <br><br>  Please note that you can only install Windows 7.8 64-bit on a MacBook Air 6.1 11-inch 2013 via BootCamp.  Why not offer other operating systems, is not explained. <br>  BootCamp Master offers: <br><ol><li>  Create a Windows 7 or later installation disc. </li><li>  Download the latest Windows support software. </li><li>  Install Windows 7. </li></ol><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/18d/df1/cc0/18ddf1cc067d7fd47af3ddebbeefbdf9.jpg"><br><br>  It's no secret that many people don‚Äôt like Windows 8. Windows 7 was familiar to my users, and I‚Äôm glad that they propose to install it. <br><br>  To start the installation, BootCamp requires a blank flash drive and an ISO image of Windows 7. <br>  Often there is a problem that you have an ‚ÄúISO image 12 in 1‚Äù and you don‚Äôt like BootCamp in any way. <br>  I found out that the problem is not the licensed purity of the disks, but the lack of files in the image that are necessary for the subsequent system boot. <br><br>  Check in the ISO image of the disk directory in the image \ efi \ boot \. <br>  It should contain a file bootx64.efi. <br>  Frankly speaking, the ISO directory may be called differently, but the BootCamp is looking like this. <br><br><h4>  And why even EFI? </h4><br>  But because the Mac does not have the usual BIOS. <br>  BIOS is obsolete.  Slows down loading, does not allow to use sections more than 2 TB. <br>  Logically, Apple got rid of it.  MacBook Air 2013 is the first Mac that is compatible with UEFI 2.0, and supports downloading via EFI both OS X and Windows.  And not only supports, but already works.  Mac OS OS 64-bit EFI is used to download Mac. <br><br>  <b>And that's why only 64-bit Windows is required.</b> <br><br>  Microsoft requirements for installing UEFI: <br>  <a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh824898.aspx">technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh824898.aspx</a> <br><br>  Not just like that, before launching BootCamp, it is strongly advised to update your Mac.  Among other updates, there may be EFI and SMC updates that can help with installation and future work. <br><br>  All this I, of course, did not know.  I inserted a flash drive, indicated the path to ISO Windows 7-64 bits and after almost an hour of waiting until the BootCamp files are downloaded (about 500MB), I was offered to allocate space for the Windows partition. <br><br>  I was very pleased with how quickly and clearly the partition manager managed to split the main partition into 2 parts.  In the Windows world, a separate program was required, a lot of time and it was scary for the data on the disk. <br>  Immediately after creating the partition, the computer rebooted and began to boot from the flash drive itself.  The usual installation of Windows has begun.  The process went very smoothly and soon I was asked to enter a computer name.  But it could not be done. <br><br>  Neither the keyboard, nor the trackpad, nor the USB mouse, nor the USB keyboard worked. <br><br>  In Windows 7, there are no drivers for USB 3. And in MAcBook Air there is not a single mean USB 2 port. <br>  I successfully booted from a WinPE flash drive made on the basis of the WAIK from Windows 8, and I had a keyboard and a trackpad.  Attempts to substitute drivers and correct the registry on the installed system were unsuccessful. <br><br>  The elbow was close, but ... <br><br>  I tried to install and re-install drivers in the disk layout dialog.  I note that the Shift + F10 key combination is very helpful.  She opens a window with the command line, in which you can even command. <br>  The situation with Windows 7 is not hopeless, but, unfortunately, this system could not be easily installed. <br><br>  <b>There is an exit:</b> <br>  <a href="https://discussions.apple.com/thread/5742492%3Ftstart%3D75">discussions.apple.com/thread/5742492?tstart=75</a> <br><br>  You will need another flash drive and additional software from Microsoft. <br>  Those who have already built their Windows PE, know about <b>DISM</b> .  The rest of the need to understand and strictly follow the instructions.  There will be no automation, everything should be done with pens. <br><br>  If you don't like this option, there are others: <br><ol><li>  Forget about EFI and use Windows 7 in legacy mode. </li><li>  Install Windows 8. </li></ol><br>  During my attempts to install Windows, I was surprised by the fact that I have a keyboard and a trackpad immediately after rebooting from BootCamp. <br><br>  <b>What miracles and magic?</b> <br>  One day, after rebooting, I didn‚Äôt neatly leave my hard external drive connected, just like a bootable flash drive, and the boot started from just an external drive, and I saw only a black screen instead of an installation screen. <br>  Realizing my mistake and being overloaded from the flash drive, I was surprised again, because already at the initial stage there was no keyboard or trackpad. <br><br>  All this fascinated me a little, and I found a wonderful reason. <br>  There is a command that allows you to set the <b>legacy mode</b> in which the BIOS is emulated and Windows 7 starts to install with the current trackpad and keyboard. <br><br>  It is necessary to perform in the terminal Mac OS: <br><br>  diskutil list <br>  sudo bless --device / dev / disk0s4 --setBoot --legacy --nextonly <br><br>  <b>--nextonly</b> indicates using the mode only once!  This is how BootCamp works.  Thank God that at least it has not become easier, but everything is clear. <br><br>  Visually, the BIOS mode in Mac differs from the EFI boot in that after a gray screen for a moment, a blinking cursor appears on a black background. <br><br>  Those interested can appreciate the difference in download speed in my video on youtube: <br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/HITe9-VOrDI%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=25657,15700022,15700043,15700186,15700190,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhgIu-YEYhxGZoCpWRytOVBjLk_zWw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  If you get tired of listening to the sound that makes the Mac when you restart, you can put StartNinja: <br>  <a href="http://www.allvu.com/index.php/products/startninja.html">www.allvu.com/index.php/products/startninja.html</a> <br>  The program can turn on and off the sound of the Mac.  Free <br><br>  To find out which UEFI / Legacy boot mode is used in Windows, there is a small program ‚Äú <b>detectefi</b> ‚Äù. <br>  Source: <br>  <a href="">xcat.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/xcat/xcat-core/trunk/xCAT-server/share/xcat/netboot/windows/detectefi.cpp</a> <br>  The code is very simple, literally 3 lines.  You can find the executable file or build it yourself. <br><br>  Problems with installing Windows 7 are not just me.  And people share their personal experiences on the Apple support site.  Most of the tips give, I'm sorry, the same amateurs, as well as readers of the site.  Representatives of the apple company in the answers are not found. <br><br>  I caught the bait that someone managed to install Win7 using not the 5th BootCamp, but the fourth.  Nothing good, of course, did not work. <br>  I tried differently, but some devices in Windows still remained unknown. <br><br>  The multimedia controller is completely puzzled. <br>  It turned out to be: Cirrus Logic CS4208 <br>  Apple Camera with VEN_14E4 &amp; DEV_1570 is nowhere else! <br><br>  Do not succumb to advertising any kind of detectives.  In the best case, they will supply you with all kinds of advarna rubbish.  But they do not have drivers.  Apple has drivers! <br><br>  <b>Therefore, installing without BootCamp is much more difficult!</b> <br><br>  If you go back to the official BootCamp page, it clearly states that to install on a MacBook Air 2013, you need to use the kit created during the BootCamp process. <br>  <a href="http://support.apple.com/kb/HT5634%3Fviewlocale%3Den_US">support.apple.com/kb/HT5634?viewlocale=en_US</a> <br><br>  The BootCamp.exe executable file itself remains the 5th version, but in the process of creating a flash drive, drivers for your model are downloaded that are not in BootCamp5, which is available for free download. <br>  As a result, if you take Windows 8 and act strictly according to the instructions, then Windows is installed quite smoothly and everything works. <br><br>  Bootcamp.exe manages keyboard and trackpad settings.  You can configure the Mac function keys to work in the same way as in Windows, and the additional functions were called using the Fn key combination. <br><br>  It's funny that when you run BootCamp.exe, it checks the AppleKeybMngr value in the Run key.  If there is no value in the registry, the BootCamp does nothing. <br><br>  The second Macbook Air was 13-inch.  Model 6.2.  Windows 8 was installed and all devices were found, but every few seconds there were unpleasant distortions of the screen sweep.  Distortions so unpleasant that it was completely impossible to use a computer. <br><br>  I updated the HD Graphics 5000 driver from the Intel site.  Nothing changed.  If you kill the process of BootCamp.exe, then problems happen less often, but they do not disappear completely.  On Mac OS X, everything works perfectly. <br><br>  I suffered and finally chose a compatible driver from Microsoft instead of Intel driver.  On the problem and decided. <br><br>  Happy end!  MacBook Air loads quickly and you can switch from one OS to another in less than a minute.  The battery life is more than 8 hours. <br><br><h4>  Useful links: </h4><br>  Official BootCamp page: <br>  <a href="http://support.apple.com/kb/ht1461">support.apple.com/kb/ht1461</a> <br>  Boot a PC in UEFI Mode or Legacy BIOS-compatibility mode: <br>  <a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh825112.aspx">technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh825112.aspx</a> <br>  Haswell iMac Boot Camp Windows 7 Drivers: <br>  <a href="http://forums.macrumors.com/showthread.php%3Ft%3D1659481">forums.macrumors.com/showthread.php?t=1659481</a> <br>  Bless.
