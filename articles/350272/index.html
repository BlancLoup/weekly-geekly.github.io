"Network Basics".  "Switches from Cisco".  Eddie Martin  December 2012 </h4><br>  We are here with you for the third day and many are waiting for a web presentation from me.  Where is she?  She's on the Internet.  As they say - where is the tree?  It is in the forest.  Where is the sheet?  He is on a tree.  So, now I will show you some combinations, the most rational schemes for the application of our products.  We will use the Cisco external site.  Why external?  Our customers can go there.  In the past, sales representatives could simply hand out brochures with information, show products and talk to a customer.  Today we go to a client who knows everything about us and maybe even more than we know about ourselves.  The Internet has changed the rules of the game, now everything is completely different. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/mo/ry/da/morydaetem0abjk9awfn0rus2zo.jpeg"><br><br>  So, now I will connect my laptop, but if I don‚Äôt wear glasses, we will immediately finish our presentation.  Everything works perfectly.  Let's take a look at the Cisco site.  I will show you several paths that you might not have known.  If I need switches, I will type in www.  cisco.com/go/switching.  And I get on this page in the section of switches. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/vv/-s/34/vv-s34ki_12ipq0ir4ftqkh7s14.jpeg"><br><br>  If I want to look at the routers, then dial go / routers.  I can look at voice and video technologies, at protection programs, I will also type go / and the necessary section.  This is a go-strategy.  So we call it. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/zn/h3/in/znh3inarjodilkdnquwpevtedjm.jpeg"><br><br>  We see several switches here, let's look at the access switches.  We start at the bottom and see the Catalyst 2960 model. It runs at level 2 and provides service at the L2-L4 levels.  This means that it can support the 802.1x standard, you can go deeper into the frame or assign a VLAN, but the switch will not provide the possibility of routing, routing and traffic exchange between different networks.  This is only the second level. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/8x/6o/yu/8x6oyuqyhlpckxwhsxw_xgvnfe4.jpeg"><br><br>  Switches 2929 series - access switches, they provide PoE +, go to another page and see more specifications.  Such switches have 8, 24, or 48 Gigabit Ethernet ports.  Then we can go to the model comparison page.  But for some reason she does not scroll.  Let me remind you that at the second level switches of the 29xx series work, and level 3 begins with the switches of the 33xx series.  We have compact industrial switches without unnecessary problems.  Now I have opened the switch configuration page, here we see the numbers of various models, decipher some of them to you. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ku/g4/nv/kug4nv0xnr6qmks21ipahdcxtka.jpeg"><br><br>  Take, for example, LAN Base layer 2, it belongs to the working group of switches, and therefore stands the abbreviation WS.  The Catalyst 2960-S is the latest model that we released, S means a stackable, rack-mount switch that can be expanded.  The number 48 tells me about the number of ports that clients can use, if 24 is written, it means only 24 ports.  Then comes T (twisted pair), which means twisted pair, a type of copper cable that is used to connect.  Next, we see the letter D, which indicates that we have uplinks, and they are of fiber optic type.  This switch has two 10 Gbps uplinks for connecting to distribution switches.  Uplink ports are required for the convenience of connecting a similar device.  Without them, in the case of a twisted pair and a speed of 1 Gbit / s, for example, you have to compress the patchcord, twisting the green and orange pair.  Otherwise, the signals on these devices will have the same direction.  One pair of both switches will try to send packets to each other.  And on the other, both will wait for a response to the requested package.  In general, we can say that the switch has 48 ports that are connected using copper wire and two more 10-gigabit ports connected using fiber optic cable.  Remember that T is twisted pair, i.e. copper, and D is optics. <br><br>  Then there is the letter L, which means LANBASE software.  So, do we see here somewhere information about the power switch?  Not.  If we want to see a switch that provides power, then we need to go down here - to the model 2960 S, 48 FP ports, where FP is the total power.  We can provide 30 watts per port.  This is what FP means.  If we see an LP, this is limited power, for half of the ports 30 watts each. <br><br>  I try to explain the main points to you now, but after you visit this page 10 thousand times, you will remember everything.  I hope that you will come here often, as this will mean a huge amount of sales.  You will begin to understand the reasons for the appearance of these letters in the names.  Everything will become clear. <br><br>  I got a question about switches stacks.  I will tell you that in the 90s, Cisco considered the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãstacks, stacking switches to be very unclassical.  But that was until they sold their first rack-mount stack switch that could be built up (stackable switch).  Then they decided that they were still very cool.  You can stack only 4 switches and this is not smart stacking.  The maximum you get is 20 gigabits between switches, but this is not a smart network.  Please note that these switches do not have redundant power supplies.  There is only one source.  What happens if the power supply stops working?  Will we get a problem?  Since these are the cheapest switches operating at the second level, they can only assign VLANs, but cannot transfer data between them.  And they, by the way, have that very energywise function.  You can power and manage PoE.  But think, if I buy this switch, will I have PoE?  No, I have to buy another switch.  I will not be able to upgrade the switch that does not have power to the one that has it.  That is why you need to be very careful when choosing.  I honestly do not understand why we need to buy switches without PoE in our time.  This is stupid.  Let's see what this switch looks like.  Let's go back to the slide. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/8l/7c/oo/8l7coozn3a44p3--_y6lwhizlau.jpeg"><br><br>  See the areas highlighted in yellow?  These are the ports that provide power.  The remaining gray ports do not support PoE.  I'm not saying that you need to go and look at these switches and look at them.  For you sellers, this is a waste of time.  You need to sell them, and not look at them.  These are representatives of the lowest category of switches of our brand.  You can choose 10 gigabit uplink or 4 gigabit aplnik in them. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/-o/qm/he/-oqmhez_jxmwczuaoks46pmbtzy.jpeg"><br><br>  Then a picture jumped out, this is my daughter Emily (right) and her friend.  I don't know what they were doing that evening, but it definitely cost me a lot of money. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/kq/7l/0b/kq7l0bozk563qoc6ziaov4yvp28.jpeg"><br><br>  Now we go up a notch and look at the Catalyst 3560-X switch.  Let's read what we write about this series on the site.  With a series of 33xx and above, we have new opportunities.  What about security?  What if you want to encrypt all the information from your device?  Starting with the 35xx series and above, we have this opportunity.  At the second level, you can encrypt all incoming data and data on the network transmission path.  Why is it important?  Is it important in our time?  Not as important as it will be a couple of years later, I'm sure.  What if you want to encrypt a video session?  What if you need to encrypt a video conversation over your manager who wants to make a new acquisition?  These switches will enable you to do this. <br><br>  The main thing is not that you can use this function now.  Cisco looked a little into the future, when it will be even more important, and now they have provided the opportunity to use this feature, as well as QoS for the fastest uninterrupted data transfer.  You can also order an additional power source that provides redundancy, and fail-safe and has the ability to "hot" replacement.  If your client says that his network should never fall, then this switch is your choice.  Again, we reduce customer costs with energywise.  These switches support ipv6, PoE, let's see what else they have.  It is best to look at the information in the specification.  If you have never seen our specifications before - they look like this.  These specifications describe all the capabilities of the devices.  It shows the number of ports and other information, but now we will return to the previous page. <br><br>  The 3560 Series Switch is a standalone switch.  He has two power sources, we can compare models here in this tab.  This type of switch can be bundled with three different types of software.  You can buy a variant with LB (land-based) software, this is a second-level switch with some characteristics of the third, and it is cheaper.  You can upgrade this switch and completely transfer it to the third level for $ 2000, increasing its level to S (stackable switch).  Or upgrade it again and get a fully functioning router. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/rp/ks/2w/rpks2wr5ojvtxc4sbyifh5fcqj8.jpeg"><br><br>  Let me remind you that your clients can either raise or lower the switch level at their discretion.  I advise you not to sell second-level switches to clients, I would not do that, it is better to take the third.  The third level works best with video, multi gear and so on.  Even if I have only 10-15 people in my company, I will do just that. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/7x/sa/cw/7xsacwqd1cmw5tgyvyu5lgmsl00.jpeg"><br><br>  One more important detail is the uplink ports, we can switch from 4 one-gigabit ports to two ten gigabit ports.  That is, you can replace 4 ports with two and get a transmission bandwidth of 20 gigabits between two switches.  This is an important feature of the 3560 series switch.  Thus, if the X series, with 4 gigabit uplinks, does not suit you, since you want to transmit video at high speed, then you can immediately order the 3560G model with two ten-gigabit uplinks, or get this model as a result of the module replacement. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/pa/qt/ft/paqtft60w-bdflmziy5xa8r33bw.jpeg"><br><br>  Switch model 3750, my favorite switch in the family of autonomous communicators. <br>  And then I'll tell you why, let's look at its technical characteristics: it has the same functions as its predecessors - PoE, QoS, but there is the possibility of stacking (stackable switch), that is, the switch can be a stack one.  Here in the picture we can see 4 such switches at once.  Behind on the left they have connection ports.  This is an intelligent connection.  Although each switch is independent, in the case of a stack, one of them will play the role of a controller ‚Äî the master switch.  This switch will control routing tables (routing table), address memory ( <a href="https://www.packet6.com/cam-table-fundamental-switch-operations/">CAM-table</a> ) and switching (switching-table) for all 9 switches in the stack.  This will give you 64 gigabits between switches.  To the right on the rear panel there are 4 power supplies.  This is another Cisco innovation - power stacking. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/al/qb/r9/alqbr9lawi79shen_a3_tg0swmu.jpeg"><br><br>  Each of these modules in this configuration is able to provide power to another switch.  The point of this solution is to reduce the number of power supplies when buying new switches.  That is, in this case, we could remove 2 power supply units, while the other 2 power units could well provide the fault tolerance of power for the entire infrastructure.  This technology was created by Cisco, before it did not exist such solutions.  For example, if I want to provide power to the group of switches located on the screen on the left, I simply bring the power cable from the 3750X power supply to it. <br><br>  It is important to note that a stackable solution can contain a maximum of 4 switches, because in a configuration of 9 switches, you should use 3, 3 and 3 switches in a stack, that is, 3 stacks. <br><br>  The following shows switches, which also have dual power - from a normal network and from PoE.  These communicators can be used to create IP-telephony, LAN and for other tasks in the creation of networks. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ya/eb/r0/yaebr0v_rzig4m4ym2whottanzy.jpeg"><br><br>  The next product to pay attention to is the 4500 E series switch, the distribution switch.  The first model of the line received an index of 4503 E. There are three slots, one of which is intended for the supervisor.  Total we have 2 "useful" slots.  How many slots besides the controller in the 4506-E switch?  Five.  But now there will be a little tricky question.  How many slots does the 4507-R have?  Seven, and two of them are designed to accommodate supervisors, and another 5 remain to expand the chassis configuration.  We have released switches, in which at first glance there is no need, the 4507-R chassis is approximately $ 1,000 more expensive than a model that supports only 1 supervisor (4506-E).  However, this approach allows the user to solve the problem of redundancy.  It is better to have a slot that is not needed than not to have a slot that is needed.  We give the client the opportunity to configure the equipment for specific needs and expand its capabilities. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/kh/-0/kt/kh-0ktamfk17w4ezdonobzm4xti.png"><br><br>  Every day, the client needs to send more and more information, so the possibility of expanding the equipment plays a huge role.  These switches are suitable for service providers, and for office networks. <br><br>  The next model is 4510, it has 10 slots, incl.  two for supervisors.  Thus, if any eigrp services fail, they will automatically be restarted, this is the basis of the Linux kernel and the duplication of supervisors will help to ensure fault tolerance. <br><br>  Due to the fact that our switches are based on Linux and support the standard Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP), there is support for third-party software with which you can manage these devices and capture various indicators.  Our switches can give out all the necessary information about the health, for example, to warn of excess temperature.  Knowing that the server automatically shuts down at a temperature of 90 ¬∞, you can set the parameters when the system warns you in advance about the temperature increase to 60 or 70 ¬∞. <br><br>  The 4500 series is today a basic Cisco switch that provides 860 gigabits per second.  This is the only platform today that uses Cisco Universal Power UPOE, which is not yet a standard yet.  UPOE provides each connected device with 60 watts of power.  This is more than enough for any modern network equipment, VXI clients that we talked about, screens, etc.  If you are able to provide an electronic device with 60 W power, consider that you have a nuclear reactor, especially when you have a switch for 24 or 48 ports. <br><br>  Next comes the 6500 series. We have already mentioned SSL digital signature technology.  SSL is used to authenticate the client and server and encrypts the data between them.  This protocol is used by the 6500 series switches. Today it is the most unique switch, the only one in the world, which embodies the most advanced data encryption technology.  We even acquired a company for this. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/lu/ee/cg/lueecgxaxicbu2k85bybiku8sf0.jpeg"><br><br>  I want to acquaint you with the features of this switch, so we turn to its technical characteristics.  It provides a total bandwidth of up to 2 terabits per second, 80 gigabits per second per slot, and was created on the Catalist 5000 series platform. If you remember, the 2900 series switch provides only level 2.  The 4500 series switch operates at levels 2‚Äì7, and the 6500 series switch does the same ‚Äî it runs from level 2 to level 7.  But its main difference is that right out of the box it uses SSL technology, it is built into it, and the client does not need to buy additional equipment for digital signatures.  ACE balances the load and encrypts traffic.  Switch 6500 can be equipped with a firewall - a firewall to counter external threats and intrusions.  VPN services, network analysis, wireless network management - all this switch can contain thanks to separate embedded modules.  The 6500 chassis can contain exactly what you need, since the modules are not cheap.  For example, a separate module ‚Äì firewall costs about $ 30,000, and an ASA service module can cost as much as $ 35,000. <br><br>  This device is more than just a switch, more than just a router.  It was unique in the early 2000s and remains so today.  Cisco has invested more than a billion dollars in developing the 6500 series, and for the company it is a very important product.  We will support him for another 6-8 years, despite Juniper's attempts to conduct an aggressive policy against us, saying that this switch is outdated.  We have developed a new series of Nexus, which will eventually replace, but this switch is still indispensable and knows what is not yet available for Nexus.  For Internet service providers serving the network, it costs $ 400 thousand. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/15/r_/_t/15r__tn6ahw1ld7nh2ouuxbizza.jpeg"><br><br>  Speaking about the level of data centers or data centers, it is necessary to mention the switches of the Nexus 7000 series, the root switches, which are used to build the network core.  This is a powerful server hardware, which embodies the principles of networking Juniper, Cisco, HP, Dell and Brocade. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/jc/bu/rn/jcburneswjyrhh3gkplprqbtwbw.jpeg"><br><br>  There are 4 models in this series: 4, 9, 10 and 18 slots.  On the back panel of switches are ports for fiber optic cable, which provide the total bandwidth of all modules up to 15 terabytes.
