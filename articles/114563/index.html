Loyalty, satisfaction, quality of support, blah blah blah.  This is of course cool, but what does this really give companies?  Is it worth it to ‚Äúlick‚Äù customers and take care of them? <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/2f/0f/2f0f352b6a692353b102fe58f5d5a956.jpg" alt="image"><br>  Under the cut a small story about the bank, Svetlana and money. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  At the beginning of the business, when the IP registration was a big event, I asked a more experienced comrade where to open a checking account.  About the bank, which he recommended to me, had not heard before.  It was already decided to work with better-known and ‚Äúreliable‚Äù banks, but trusted a friend and opened a p / s in his bank. <br><br>  <b>Conclusion 1</b> .  People, including me, less and less believe advertising.  People <b>believe the recommendations</b> .  And not only from friends and acquaintances, but also recommendations on the Internet. 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"

        </script>
      <br>
      In the process of opening a p / s, it became clear why a friend recommended this particular bank.  Friendly staff, convenient working order, no queues and other pleasant things.  Svetlana became my manager.  I do not know how in other banks, but in this for the use of client-bank, it was necessary to submit a tax return.  And since  I was at the USN, then the declaration is submitted once a year, in the end I had to wait for the client bank for more than half a year.  And this is a printing of payments, trips to the bank in person and other inconveniences <br><br>  Svetlana went to the meeting and appealed to the manager with a request to provide me the client-bank without other formalities.  There were other "buns", for example, did the wiring for the call without payment, for which she could get a hat from the authorities.  In general, I liked it and when registering an LLC, I had no doubt where to open the r / s.  Because of this attitude, I went to a meeting: I placed funds on the deposit, freely hanging out on the bank account, though not at a very favorable rate.  And this is an additional income of the bank. <br><br>  <b>Conclusion 2</b> .  The average check from a loyal customer is <b>higher</b> than a neutral one.  Studies show that loyal customers can bring up to 80% of the company's revenue. <br><br>  In turn, 2 more friends asked me about where to open the r / s.  And as you probably already guessed, I advised them to your bank.  In order not to bother with accounting, we use boo.  service.  A couple of months ago, an accountant complained about the wild rates for servicing an account at her bank.  I took the opportunity and again recommended my bank. <br><br>  Do I get money for my recommendations?  Not.  Does anyone ask me to do this?  Not.  I just like being a customer of this bank, I like the attitude towards me.  I just want to help my friends and thank the bank employees. <br><br>  <b>Conclusion 3</b> .  Not advertising, but only <b>one recommendation</b> brought to the bank as many as <b>5 clients</b> (my IP + LLC, 2 friends and an accountant)!  And it is not known how much more will bring.  A satisfied customer who is loyal to the company is better than any advertising. <br><br>  Apparently, good service and loyalty are not empty words. <br><br>  <b>UPD1</b> Comrade after reading the article said that besides me, he recommended the bank to another 2m acquaintances =) <br>  <b>UPD2</b> Sorry, but I will not call the bank either in the comments or in the personal, because  this particular branch and person.  Far from the fact that in others as well.  Yes, and the name appears. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/114563/">https://habr.com/ru/post/114563/</a></p>
