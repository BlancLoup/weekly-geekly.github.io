The uniqueness of the printer lies in the fact that with good print rates, it has a surprisingly low cost - only 16,700 rubles. <br><br>  <i>A few words about the manufacturer.</i>  <i>Winbo Smart Tech Co is a large research and production enterprise; its production area covers about 20,000 square meters.</i>  <i>The company develops and manufactures equipment, materials and software for 3D printing.</i>  <i>The company has in its arsenal both desktop 3D printers and industrial models with a large area of ‚Äã‚Äãconstruction.</i>  <i>In addition to the above, the company pays great attention to the process of 3D-printing - the development and implementation of 3D-models of varying complexity.</i>  <i>With the support of Winbo, the Baiyun Winbo 3D Printing Technology College was opened.</i> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f3c/d7c/f6a/f3cd7cf6a18741f6a6601424d7df20a8.jpg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b>Appearance and design</b> <br><br>  The first thing that attracts in <a href="https://www.cvetmir3d.ru/3d-printery/domashnie/3d-printer-winbo-super-helper-sh105/">Winbo Super Helper SH105</a> is lightness and small size.  The size of the printer is 258x326x375 mm, the weight is 3.6 kg.  Many people know the eternal problem of finding free space for any equipment; this problem has been solved here.  In addition, there is a handle on the top of the device for easy transportation.  On the handle there is a hole into which a plastic holder for the coil is inserted.  Manufacturers decided to make the printer as compact and convenient as possible. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/8a0/5d6/8ce/8a05d68ce97a418792749ca16fae693a.jpg">

      Fully open printing platform allows you to monitor the printing process from any side, this is a big plus, especially for study groups, educational institutions or presentations. <br><br>  The rather simple and uncomplicated design of the Super Helper is compensated by the bright red color of the case.  Agree, an unusual color for a 3D printer! <br><br>  Developers focus on low power consumption, the Winbo presentation even presents a good example - the work of thirteen 3D Super-Helper printers equals to one conditioner in terms of power consumption. <br><br>  <b>What comes in the box</b> <br><br>  The 3D printer comes with everything you need for work: cables, a removable pad for printing, MicroSD, Card Reader, a set of tools, glue and a teflon tube. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c40/c88/12d/c40c8812df5642cb898ad63e036c3512.jpg"><br><br>  <b>Main characteristics</b> <br><br>  Super Helper is equipped with one extruder, which has a fairly good heating rate (less than 2 minutes), built-in 2 fans provide 4-points of airflow, which provides high quality PLA plastic printing.  The moving speed ranges from 50 to 100 mm / s.  The plastic feed mechanism is located separately from the extruder, on the body. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/31c/69f/bf3/31c69fbf30d94979b4d3b275cc73b9dd.png"><br><br>  <i><b>An important point!</b></i>  <i>The extruder Winbo SH105 is located on an aluminum profile, which moves during printing.</i>  <i>To avoid deforming the profile, pay attention to carefully moving the printer from place to place, and when transporting, be sure to use a box and protective foam.</i> <br><br>  A small 3.2-inch LCD screen during printing displays information about temperature (set and current), print speed in percent, print file name, blower fan speed, XYZ print options, print time, and a progress bar tasks. <br>  The interface is quite friendly, all settings are in English, for more convenient work, we have prepared instructions in Russian and a video with Russian subtitles. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/80d/b91/9ca/80db919caddb4452842467d53ce580ef.jpg"><br><br>  Winbo does not require a computer connection; to load a model, simply transfer the STL file to the SD card and insert it into the printer. <br><br>  WinWare software is recommended for Super Helper, but it is also compatible with other slicers: Simplify3D, Repetier-Host, Cura, Slic3r, etc. <br><br>  For 3D modeling, you can use any 3D program: SolidWorks, Compass-3D, Autocad, 3DsMax, Maya, Rhino, Thinkercad, and others. <br><br>  <b>3D printing options / materials used</b> <br><br>  Super Helper has a removable printing platform with a construction area - 105x105x155 mm.  For the most part, it is designed to print some small models, prototypes, mini-copies or prefabricated elements for larger models. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ae4/8bd/211/ae48bd2118214668bcb99ab2abbc5d3a.jpg"><br><br>  The thickness of the printing layer can vary from 0.04 to 0.25 mm.  The average print speed is 50 mm per second with a resolution of 50 microns. <br><br>  The printing platform is not heated, and the maximum heating temperature of the nozzle is limited to 240, respectively, it is recommended to use PLA plastic for printing.  If you plan to use Winbo with children or in a residential area, this is an ideal option for you.  First, the platform does not heat up, so the risk of burn is minimized.  Secondly, PLA is not for nothing called eco-plastic.  It is a biodegradable, non-toxic material, based on only natural ingredients (sugar cane or corn).  When heated, it does not emit harmful substances and does not have a strong odor. <br><br>  <b>Winbo Super Helper Features</b> <br><br>  ‚ÄúSuper Helper‚Äù surprised us from the very first use.  I was very pleased with the print quality along the Z axis. Honestly, the SH-105 exceeded all our expectations - as a result of multiple tests at the output, we got even and neat layers and good accuracy when creating small elements of models. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/120/860/981/120860981b0a43df8e2be02646ea7a7a.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ed6/671/158/ed66711589c7484cb4f82f6449bc1e7e.jpg"><br><br>  <a href="https://www.cvetmir3d.ru/3d-printery/domashnie/3d-printer-winbo-super-helper-sh105/">Winbo Super Helper</a> with confidence can be recommended for 3D printing of small models that do not require very high accuracy: toys, souvenirs, home or office accessories, small architectural prototypes. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/238/cc5/760/238cc5760211457caab7bf61ef965176.jpg"><br><br>  <b>Summing up ...</b> <br><br>  We can say that the Winbo Super Helper SH-105 3D printer has an ideal price-performance ratio.  With a surprisingly low cost (16,700 rubles), the printer has good print characteristics and even surpasses some of its more expensive counterparts in print quality and accuracy. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/640/9a7/dcd/6409a7dcd78a46189a093ed0ed757531.jpg"><br><br>  Super Helper is perfect for children and students, for use in educational institutions, modeling circles, creative studios, small printing houses, design agencies.  For those who are just taking the first steps in 3D printing, or have not been able to buy a 3D printer for a long time, Winbo can become a golden key to the world of 3D printing.
