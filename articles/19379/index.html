  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Lovers of freebies or software development costs</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Or rather, the debates that escalated after the New Year, in connection with the adoption of GK-4 and the first court decision on Article 146 of the Criminal Code. <br><br>  Who ever thought that information should be shared and free-of-charge? <br>  This is me as a software developer asking :) <br>  Here is a simple and purely life situation. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  A year ago, I submitted to my then management (and I worked at an innovation company) a report on the possibility of developing in-house configurations on the 1C 7.7 and 8.0 platform.  Thought and decided not to risk yet.  What's the matter? <br>  I proposed to develop a fully functional configuration for a full-fledged management accounting of something.  There are few software products that implement this, the potential demand is considerable.  But what does considerable mean? <br>  I will give an estimate of costs (simplified): <br>  This software product should live for at least 3 years (meaning the current edition of the software product, after 3 years you can release a new software). <br>  The development process from scratch will take about 2 person-years (4 programmers within six months) + need an office for programmers, jobs + person-year for testing (6 testers within 2 months) + other overhead costs in the amount of 10%.  The net development time is 6 months and another 2.5 years is necessary to provide free technical support for the client (these are the conditions of 1C and it is not for us to change them). <br>  Thus, the costs: <br>  FOT programmers-developers 3 * 6 * 40 tr (with taxes, we all pay in white) = 720 tr <br>  FOT of the lead programmer (he is the project architect) 1 * 6 * 55 TR  = 330 t. <br>  PHT testing specialists (here you can hire students of specialized specialties for 3-5 courses and agree on internship with their universities, but you still need to pay) 6 * 2 * 15 TR  = 180 tr. <br>  Payroll specialist in support and development of 1 * 30 * 40 TR  = 1.200 tr. <br>  The workplace of the developer programmer (5 sq.m. of total office space, office furniture, computer for development is not budgetary by the way) -70 TR  for half a year, 4 pieces are necessary, total 280 tr. <br>  Jobs testing specialists - rent comp.  hall of 6 cars for a period of 2 months -150t.r. <br>  Workplace support and development specialist - 350t.r.  (just like developers) <br><br>  Total costs: payroll and the arrangement of jobs = 3,210 TR <br>  Overhead costs - 10% of the amount of previous expenses = 320 tr. <br>  A separate line will highlight the costs of certification in 1C itself and the protection of copies sold - in the amount it is about 400.t.r. <br>  Well, we must not forget about advertising :) We need a full-fledged website, PP advertising on the Internet and magazines, various conferences and seminars.  Since the PP is niche, we set an advertising budget of 1,500 tr.  - the cost of bringing to each potential client only 60 rubles. <br>  Thank God, we do not pay VAT on software products since January 1, 2008.

      Now about the planned income and price. <br>  Market analysis showed that approximately 24 thousand enterprises and organizations in Russia are our potential customers.  We have two competitors working in different price and functional niches - expensive and cheap; we focus on the sector between them - the average price and the average functionality.  Thus, we compete only in border segments and can count on a market capacity of 12 thousand potential customers.  We will count on 5 thousand legal installations of our software for 3 years. <br>  Investing for 3 years should bring at least 30% of gross profit per year (modern Russian profitability of small enterprises), thus, having expenses of 5.430 tr, we have to earn 11.930 tr.  Otherwise, we will not find any investor - why invest in enough venture capital business? <br>  We should also not forget about implementing partners in the regions of our vast country, as well as about our favorite company 1C, on whose platform we developed all this and through whose network we will distribute it all.  I think that I will not reveal the ultra-limiting secret that the developer‚Äôs gross income constitutes the MAXIMUM of 40% of the final cost of the software for the consumer. <br>  10% of the final cost will be taken by a large wholesaler in the face of 1C and its partners in the regions, 50% of the final cost is taken by the vendor that sells the box for you, and then implements it for some money at all :) That is, the resulting I must multiply the amount by another 2.5.  Total 29.825.000 rubles - the final cost of circulation.  And I divide it by 5 thousand copies, receiving the price of 6 thousand rubles per copy. <br>  This is a business software, but it is a niche software, and every system administrator in the enterprise who puts my software illegally ... I have a market END. <br>  What is the main problem?  If I divide the cost of PP by 10% of honest users, it will turn out 1200 copies, at a price of 25 tr. Per copy.  If I divide by 50% honest - it turns out 6 thousand copies, 5 thousand per copy. <br>  People who use software for free - they steal not directly from me (although they also drive risks of bankruptcy) - they steal from those who honestly pay. <br>  That's why I, as a software developer and a person who is extremely trying to buy only licensed software, do not like freelovers very much. <br><br>  Update: removed abusive words :) <br></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/19379/">https://habr.com/ru/post/19379/</a></p>
