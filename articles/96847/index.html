We will try to publish interesting materials related to our work, as well as related to the topic of SaaS. <br><br><h5>  Foreword </h5><br>  In July 2009, we began developing <a href="http://cms.biggo.ru/">website builder</a> .  By this time we already had: <br><ul><li>  several large realized web projects </li><li>  experience using Django (from version 0.90), Python, PostgreSQL </li><li>  Trading network Biggo.Ru, which lacks catastrophically time, because  The focus is on site builder.  About him and will be discussed further </li></ul><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/2f3/5ef/730/2f35ef73060edb59790ea221870f36b6.png" alt="image">

      After half a year of development, we released a pilot version of our product, which was already used to create our sites, i.e.  was not quite raw.  However, due to circumstances, the promotion had to be postponed soon after launch.  But it is possible for the better, because  Since January, we have introduced many new features and modules, and also fixed many bugs.  And, of course, they added new ones =) The ten clients who started working with the pilot version helped us a lot with their wishes and bug reports.  For this they thank you very much. <br><br><h5>  Who needs it? </h5><br><br>  Anyone who needs an online store in 10 minutes (+ filling time, created in the morning, can be sold in the evening).  Anyone who needs an informational site with interactive elements (like tree comments).  Or for those who need a business card site today.  Those who do not even want to hear about the terms "script", "hosting", "programming".  For those who want to try, without losing anything.  Even if your online store, God forbid, fail, you will lose the maximum time to fill it. <br><br>  And also for those who want to create websites quickly and cheaply for their customers.  Yes, we welcome new partners and work with them on individual conditions. <br><br><h5>  About the constructor </h5><br><br>  Despite the fact that our designer is not an absolute novelty in the field of site building, we have tried to make it unique in terms of convenience and flexibility.  The word <b>flexibility</b> means: <br><ul><li>  the ability to change the html code of any element of the site </li><li>  unlimited nesting of menu and directory sections </li><li>  any paths for objects, including Russian-speaking </li><li>  any parameters of goods, including interactive </li><li>  unlimited number of images for objects </li><li>  just do not list ... </li></ul><br>  <b>Convenience</b> means functions like domain registration within CMS (partnership with REG.RU), the ability to assign DNS ns [1,2,3] .biggo.ru from your registrar, integration with gmail, integration with retail networks, more 100 built-in designs, smart FTP access.  What ‚Äúsmart‚Äù means, in short, is the recognition of file names and image assignment to products automatically, integration with the file module.  But the main convenience is a clear interface, at least for most of our users. <br>  We hope that the habrasoobshchestvo will try these two concepts (convenience and flexibility) for ourselves, and we will be happy to hear feedback. <br><br>  It should be noted that the designer was created on the <b>Django</b> framework already familiar to us.  This means that the user has a template from it.  He is already familiar to many, and to whom he is not familiar - will not seem complicated.  By the way, we recently updated to version 1.2, so that the ‚Äúsmart‚Äù if tag also works. <br><br>  In addition, products such as PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Redis were used.  In future topics, if someone seems interesting, we can highlight the last two in more detail, as well as the subtleties of our FTP, which is entirely written in python, which made it possible to integrate it closely into the system. <br><br><h5>  About the model </h5><br><br>  On the very model of SaaS, to which our designer belongs, there have already been many posts, but probably it would not be superfluous to reflect a little on this topic in the site building plane. <br>  There are enough SaaS minuses, but with reference to this plane, we will single out only one thing - the inability to independently add functionality that is missing.  Yes, from that where not to leave, except how to fulfill each whim of each consumer.  But this is unrealistic, therefore we implement only the most frequently requested functions. <br>  But, this minus, it affects the price only in the best way.  All users gradually get new features automatically.  Everything else in our opinion is a solid plus. <br><br><h5>  Let's link already! </h5><br><br>  If you are interested in our new product - welcome: <a href="http://cms.biggo.ru/">cms.biggo.ru</a> <br>  We are waiting for feedback / opinions / wishes. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/96847/">https://habr.com/ru/post/96847/</a></p>
