I didn‚Äôt expect any surprises from this event, but the second Yotafon turned out to be a really interesting smartphone, in which the concept of two screens finally worked as it should. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/0c9/0b5/728/0c90b57286a5466aabee7ed635044bf4.png"><br>  <i>Yotaphone 2 will go on sale immediately in 20 countries</i> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/772/3e0/77c/7723e077c35e41c99748c60ea5a34586.jpg"><br>  <i>The first snow fell in Moscow today</i> <br><br>  Compared with the recent <a href="http://geektimes.ru/post/242068/">presentation of the new Yandex browser</a> , the presentation was arranged a bit more pathetic: before going on the stage of the general director of Yota Devices Vladislav Martynov, three violinists played Yotafon's advertising tyun live.

    <img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/33c/383/200/33c38320063c4624bbf7cd8c96534399.jpg"><br><br>  Finally, at 4:05 pm, Martynov himself came on the scene - the man who had to explain the next hour why the telephone had two screens.  And it seems that he succeeded. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/8bd/bd5/937/8bdbd59376eb4f8bb748a57f3b74cd7d.jpg"><br><br>  He began by saying that over the past 8 years, the form factors of the phones have hardly changed, but the demands of users have increased.  In this case, the company YotaDevices 3 years.  The first Yotafon was a trial balloon, so now they don‚Äôt want to call it even the first - this is the zero Yotafon, and the first one is here now.  But the event was announced as a presentation of Yotaphone 2, and the public is more or less aware of its past generation - therefore, not to be confused, I will continue to call this device a representative of the second generation <br><br>  ‚ÄúWe understood that people like it very much‚Äù - about the first ‚ÄúYotafon‚Äù. <br><br>  ‚ÄúWhat makes this unusual‚Äú Yotafon-2 ‚Äùfor me?‚Äù - Martynov asked the rhetorical question. <br><br>  Battery: up to 5 days in reading mode, up to two days in the mode of economical consumption of Yota Energy. <br><br>  Snap function: save any information (ticket, coupon, card piece) on the back eink-screen, which will remain even if the battery fully sits down. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c1f/b3e/898/c1fb3e898f594deeb2482df19389f47a.jpg"><br><br>  On the second screen, you can use any existing android application.  Yota Panels' own interface optimizes applications for the e-ink screen.  With the help of the iota SDK, you can upgrade any application to this screen. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/6ee/767/093/6ee76709313848b39e03cdf585d63dd5.jpg"><br>  <i>You can simply display the android screen on e-ink</i> <br><br>  Yota Cover allows you to display any of the saved photos on your phone or from social networks (facebook, instagram). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/feb/e2f/4b4/febe2f4b4e36497d86081ba5ec7a1dc9.png"><br>  <i>Slogan "Yotafona": "Phone from two sides"</i> <br><br>  Martynov also briefly mentioned that Yota Devices has released a special version of a smartphone for state institutions that meets safety requirements: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a7f/204/8a1/a7f2048a118841f1a7163c8b69d88102.jpg"><br><br>  But they have no state orders yet - although they hope for them. <br><br>  Compared with the previous generation, Yotaphone 2 sleeker and more compact.  The thickness of the phone is less than 9 mm. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/75c/f21/eba/75cf21eba7054d72885c91d0aefd1002.jpg"><br><br>  <b>Main characteristics:</b> <br><br>  Screen: 5 ", 1920x1080 <br>  Second screen: 4.7 "e-ink. Both screens are touch, you can use them with gloves <br>  Processor: Qualcomm Snapdragon 800 quad-core <br>  Memory: 2 GB RAM, 32 GB built-in <br>  Photo: camera 8 MP, front - 2.1 MP <br>  Wireless: LTE, Wi-Fi and NFC <br>  Weight and dimensions: 144 x 69.5 x 8.9 mm, 145 g <br>  OS: Android 4.4.2.  In the first quarter of 2015, an update to Android 5 will be released. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ccd/c9b/115/ccdc9b11566942cfa243eb1bc3fcf180.jpg"><br>  <i>With the help of "Yotafona" you can take a selfie on the main camera</i> <br><br>  Antennas are located in the upper and lower parts of the case to provide high-quality communication without interference from the screens.  For the management of the external screen is responsible for a pair of preloaded Yotov applications. <br><br>  In general, the development was not a simple task, it was necessary to solve specific problems of using e-ink displays in smartphones: electronic ink is sensitive to temperature extremes, which are almost guaranteed when the 4-core processor of the smartphone is used. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/fb1/0d5/3d9/fb10d53d97b4484b9a303b3a6836a48c.jpg"><br><br>  Chip service Yota Devices: round the clock technical support and replacement of the phone during the repair, if necessary. <br><br>  A service center (‚ÄúYotacenter‚Äù) - something like ‚ÄúApplestor‚Äù will be opened on the basis of ‚ÄúFlacon‚Äù design factory, judging by the description: you can come there, talk, get acquainted with the ‚ÄúYota Devices‚Äù equipment and, of course, make a purchase. <br><br>  The cost of the Yotaphone 2: <a href="http://yotaphone.com/ru-ru/">32 990 p</a> (like the whole Samsung Galaxy Note 4 or 2/3 iPhone 6).  A bit unusual price for a smartphone with a domestic brand - no spirituality.  A small insider: at the beginning of the summer, the prototype Yotafon-2 was shown to the elect and voiced the price of 18 thousand rubles.  But since then, the dollar has risen 1.7 times - and, accordingly, the price of Yotafon has also been indexed, obviously. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/52b/c8f/fd0/52bc8ffd0a88490f945463f2564c7e2b.jpg"><br>  <i>The box is beautiful, the contents are packed soundly and not without grace.</i>  <i>Chip: the phone in it is exactly the ink screen up</i> <br><br>  The first batch of "Yotafonov" - 150 thousand smartphones (it is easy to calculate that the market value of the party is $ 100 million), which Yota Devices hopes to sell off before the New Year holidays.  According to Martynov, most of them have already been ordered by stores in 20 European countries, in which Yotaphone 2 will be available in December.  In the first quarter of 2015, the smartphone will be available in China and other countries of the Asia-Pacific region, then in Canada and Latin America. <br><br>  The cost of developing Yotafona was $ 15 million (for comparison, the first iPhone was worth $ 150 million). <br><br>  For the owners of the first generation Yotafona the second generation will cost 26,390 p.  Raise your hands, a lot of you? <br><br><h4>  Personal impressions </h4><br>  In a sense, the impression of the new "Yotafon" in the hands is shocking, because of the old memory of the past model and generally based on the concept of a two-screen phone, you expect something heavy, cumbersome and inconvenient - from the category of those things whose inconvenience You have to constantly justify their functionality. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/30d/952/070/30d952070e6641278153e759e3a4c0f6.jpg"><br><br>  I once had a laptop with two screens, so I know what I'm talking about: its lid with two displays was twice as thick and heavier than a regular laptop lid.  "Yotafon" in the hand lies, feels and looks like any other five-inch smartphone - it just has a 4.7-inch e-ink screen on the back cover. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ec6/339/f84/ec6339f84a1443748065ada76da34a0a.jpg"><br><br>  Thanks for reading. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/363779/">https://habr.com/ru/post/363779/</a></p>
