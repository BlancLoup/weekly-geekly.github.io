Naturally, the BIOS firmware changed everything.

      You can download MOD.BIOS from here: <br>  <a href="http://osrom.net/biosmod/" title="Cry! Gow!">http://osrom.net/biosmod/</a> - <a href="" title="GetIt!">EeePC1000H1103</a> <br><br>  <i>After the firmware in this way, you will not receive any external changes in the BIOS - new menus and secret control points, you can not even search.</i> <br><br>  By the way, if for any reason unknown to anyone you need to ‚Äúroll back‚Äù BIOS, then do not even try to do this with the latest AFUDOS versions, ASUS decided to ‚Äúsew‚Äù a check on an already installed version of BIOS into its utilities, ‚Äúthanks to‚Äù roll back the BIOS, the utility happily tells you that - you have already installed a fresh one and you do not need it at all. <br>  Come to the aid of one of the first versions of AFUDOS that without unnecessary words cope with the task.  ( <a href="" title="GetIt!">Download - AFUDOS001</a> ) <br><br><h4>  <b>Installation</b> </h4><br>  In the case of installing MAC OS X, exactly the same way as with <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/eeepc/40111/" title="Cry! Gow!">installing Vista,</a> I used the most common SATA DVD drive and USB2.0 to SATA + IDE 2.5 "+ 3.5" Adapter (Combo). <br><br>  After the BIOS was successfully flashed-modified, I connected the drive to the laptop, and after turning it on I chose to boot from the DVD. <br><br>  I tried the following images: <br>  <i><b>Kalyway 10.5.2 DVD Intel Amd</b> - (Size: 3.66 GB)</i> <i><br></i>  <i><b>iATKOS v4i (10.5.4 Leopard DVD) (Intel only)</b> - (Size: 2.64 GB)</i> <i><br></i>  <i><b>Leo4Allv3 Final Universal (Mac OS X 10.5.2 Intel &amp; AMD SSE2 / SSE3)</b> - (Size: 4.38 GB)</i> <i><br></i>  <i><b>Leo4All v.4.0 Beta AMD or INTEL CPU SSE2 / SSE3</b> - (Size: 4.2 GB)</i> <br>  I think you shouldn‚Äôt explain where to look for and where to download this ‚Äúgood‚Äù. <br><br>  <b>Results:</b> <br>  <i>Kalyway 10.5.2 -</i> <br>  - installation started immediately and without additional keys <br>  - easily and without problems installed <br>  - at the installation stage, he showed himself the best <br>  - almost (!) Allowed to reach the final stage of installing and running MAC OS X without any problems. <br><br>  <i>iATKOS v4i -</i> <br>  - installation started immediately and without additional keys <br>  - did not provide a choice of installation language <br>  - did not provide Kernel kernel selection <br>  - set at 100% <br>  - after installation, when turned on, it fell into cyclic reboots (The problem is known, its solution is in the Kernel version and special BIOS settings, the first one was not the first one available to me) <br>  - iATKOS "went to the basket". <br><br>  <i>Leo4Allv3 Final Universal -</i> <br>  - installation started immediately and without additional keys <br>  - with the installation as well as with Kalyway, there were no problems, almost (!) <br>  - set at 100% <br>  - almost (!) Allowed to reach the final stage of installing and running MAC OS X without any problems. <br><br>  <i>Leo4All v.4.0 Beta -</i> <br>  - installation started immediately and without additional keys <br>  - with the installation as well as with Kalyway, there were no problems, almost (!) <br>  - set at 100% <br>  - after installation issued an error - "b0 error" <br>  - after solving the ‚Äúb0 error‚Äù problem, the ‚Äúhd () Ethernet PXE Client‚Äù problem appeared <br>  - after solving the problem of "hd () Ethernet PXE Client", the problem appeared "hd () Apple HFS" <br>  - after solving the problem "hd () Apple HFS", the problem appeared "Error parsing plist file Loading Darwin / x86" <br>  - the problem was not solved, dumped on a bad "baked" DVD <br>  - dubbed dvd <br>  - the problem was not solved, dumped on a beaten image <br>  - Leo4All v.4.0 Beta "was carefully delayed until better times" <br>  - At the time of writing these lines it is already possible to download Leo4All v.5 Server 10.5.4 Intel / AMD Released <br><br>  <b>Almost (!) Times</b> <br>  Regarding the first, almost (!) In the case of Kalyway, after successful installation, when you first start, you are asked to (1) select your region, (2) keyboard layout and (3) ‚Äúsave‚Äù from old Mac, if necessary, after the selection procedure or refusing to back up instead of continuing, I successfully returned to the choice of region and in such a cycle from (3) to (1) and again to (3) you could sit for a long time.  This problem is known and easily solved, I will give a solution below. <br>  By the way, the same problem was with Leo4All. <br><br>  <b>Almost (!) Two</b> <br>  About almost (!) In iATKOS, Leo4All v.3, Leo4All v.4 - not one of them could successfully divide and format the screw, giving the same error - ‚Äúno access to the disk‚Äù.  Kalyway did not face such a problem, it was easy to divide, merge and format. <br><br><br>  <b>Welcome!</b> <br>  So the installation, its very process with any of the images is practically identical, which is not strange, with the exception of small ‚Äúexclusive details‚Äù of this or that image. <br><br>  After choosing to boot from a DVD, you can see something like the following (depending on the selected image): <br><br> <a href="" title="Cry!  Zuum!"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/d01/635/b47/d01635b47eb74e48bb5a9c5cab6a170c.jpg" width="180"></a> <br><br>  &lt;Enter&gt; and a couple of minutes of waiting (in the case of all images except Kalyway, this time is somewhat more than a couple of minutes of waiting ‚Äù). <br><br> <a href="" title="Cry!  Zuum!"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/173/dbf/b50/173dbfb50e7528a9f87d6522269e5111.jpg" width="180"></a> <br><br>  Those who install MAC OS X on the Eee PC for the first time should know - saw the next window, and consider that you are almost lucky.  I waited for this window for several days in the hope of installing MAC OS X without modifying the BIOS. <br>  By choosing a language that will appeal to you, you can continue the installation (in the case of iATKOS v4i there will be no such choice). <br><br> <a href="" title="Cry!  Zuum!"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/ad4/3f9/dbb/ad43f9dbb97630a8d0dfa5511c85767d.jpg" width="180"></a> <br><br>  Welcome and ‚Äúexclusive details‚Äù of this or that image. <br><br> <a href="" title="Cry!

To do this, go to the "Disk Utilities", they are waiting for users in the "Utilities." <br><br> <a href="" title="Cry!  Zuum!"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/95f/403/a3d/95f403a3d418c6a2912c31e4287fcdd7.jpg" width="180"></a> <br><br>  Orienting on the spot, you must select a hard disk on which MAC OS X will be installed. In the "Parameters of the partition map map" it is necessary to select the "GUID partition map".  After that, successfully format the disk area where MAC OS X will be installed, or the entire disk, into the format - ‚ÄúMac OS Extended (journal)‚Äù. <br><br> <a href="" title="Cry!  Zuum!"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/f7e/f88/ebb/f7ef88ebbdafe87df3f504ed3b84bbcc.jpg" width="180"></a> <a href="" title="Cry!

Cry!  on the button "Continue".  Select the disk on which MAC OS X will be installed and click again!  on the button "Continue". <br><br> <a href="" title="Cry!

First you need to look at the "Settings". <br><br> <a href="" title="Cry!  Zuum!"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/c29/3bc/768/c293bc768d1a11bfc9c07a909c0c594d.jpg" width="180"></a> <br><br>  The main and most important thing is the choice of the boot kernel, in this Eee's case - this is Vanilla Kernel (the newer the better).  Next to taste?  but without fanaticism.  With the choice of drivers, you can not worry too much, almost none of them fit the Eee PC, with the exception of the Intel ICHx chipset and GMA950 video.  Round out, "Done" and "Install." <br><br> <a href="" title="Cry!  Zuum!"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/8c3/ceb/a47/8c3ceba475ed5c0803e024e5b7db1003.jpg" width="180"></a> <br><br>  "Smart" MAC OS X before you install, check whether everything is in order with the installation disk, this procedure can of course be skipped, but it is better to wait until the end, after checking it automatically switches to the installation.  "Installing!" <br><br> <a href="" title="Cry!  Zuum!"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/98d/e68/c0f/98de68c0f8b36a0701f884520592185e.jpg" width="180"></a> <a href="" title="Cry!

Reboot. <br><br> <a href="" title="Cry!  Zuum!"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/f5a/ba2/b5e/f5aba2b5e72e746c1a56cda9513df864.jpg" width="180"></a> <br><br>  After reboot, MAC OS X meets the newly created user.  "Welcome!" <br>  Actually, here it is, the very ‚Äúalmost (!) Times‚Äù mentioned above. <br>  Of course, there are people that those very "benevolent stars" favor more than me, <br>  well, or simply they are smarter than me, and accordingly, which is quite likely not everyone is faced with a similar problem. <br>  But here, somehow I did not work out. <br>  And every time after ‚ÄúDo You Already Own a Mac?‚Äù, I returned to ‚ÄúWelcome‚Äù in the middle of meeting ‚ÄúSelect Your Keyboard‚Äù. <br><br> <a href="" title="Cry!  Zuum!"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/eb4/451/0b4/eb44510b44b0dbb204e6f27dc7837165.jpg" width="180"></a> <a href="" title="Cry!

The laptop restarts, and the boot process is continuously and abruptly, but at the same time gently, &lt;F8&gt; is pressed.

After boot: you can enter a key with which you can boot, this key will be "-s".  Enter "-s", click &lt;Enter&gt;. <br><br>  Then everything is exactly to the point as described below: <br><br> <code>boot: -s</code> <br> <br>  run lines, many lines, finished run again you can enter something <br><br> <code>/sbin/fsck ‚Äìfy <br> /sbin/mount ‚Äìuw / <br> Touch /var/db/.AppleSetupDone <br> passwd root</code> <br> <br>  choose your password, enter it and remember <br><br> <code>quit <br> reboot</code> <br> <br>  reboot, after this procedure you will see the welcome window where you need to enter your username and password <br>  login: root <br>  password is the one that was created above <br>  switch layout &lt;Alt&gt; + &lt;Space&gt; <br><br> <a href="" title="Cry!

So I just can‚Äôt say whether the camera is working or not, because I don‚Äôt know.  But I had no problems with USB devices. <br><br>  <b>Bonus:</b> <br>  If anyone needs it, he scrolled the icons of the ‚ÄúX-disk‚Äù and ‚ÄúAutomator‚Äù. <br><br> <a href="" title="Cry!
