      Once my Yota keychain worked on the WiMax network.  And I in a rented apartment (for lack of the best option of access to the Internet) used it.  One day, Yota switched to LTE and distributed new keyfobs that support this standard.  I went to the Moscow Atrium at the Kursk railway station (one of the issuing centers), having given a passport scan and putting a couple of signatures, I received for free a new black LTE keychain. <br><br>  Less than a year passed and then the day came when I stopped using it, switched to a completely different apartment on ADSL.  I stopped paying for it and rearranged the tariff for Free (64 Kbps). <br><br>  The key fob was lying in the bag, and every day, leaving Podolsk to work in Moscow, I drove about an hour for the distance at which, as it turned out, Yota decently catches and the signal does not fall off. <br><br>  In the free mode, the keyfob operates at the speed of the old dial-up modem and, as expected, gives out 5-6 KBytes / second.  Browsing sites at that speed, even with images, scripts, and flashes off, is hellish torment.  I just want to see the text, read Habr, forums, news, and at the same time to answer somewhere on the forum something. <br><br>  My Asus T101MT laptop is a touchscreen transformer netbook (with a resistive screen and with a stylus in a special slot on the side), where the screen can be twisted upside down on a hinge and it will turn out to be a fat and warm tablet (about 27-28 mm thick). <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/76d/f45/2af/76df452af45a067f0c9b2a1c6a856bc8.jpg"><br>  (image from the article <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2010/04/27/asus-eee-pc-t101mt-review/">www.engadget.com/2010/04/27/asus-eee-pc-t101mt-review</a> ) <br><br>  Then one day, sitting in a carriage, being neighbors squeezed on both sides, crammed with passengers with merchants, beggars and musicians who occasionally pushed between them - I thought, what if I sat with this Windows tablet in the internet.  All browsers are sharpened under the mouse, unfortunately, and they do not have virtual keyboards for input, so this is inconvenient.  Opera was released for touchscreen Windows (it is very similar to the android version) - but it did not have Russian on the virtual keyboard and this version of Opera itself was not updated for a very long time. <br><br>  And I started writing my touch browser, it was December 2012 outside.  I inserted this browser as one of the entertainment for users in the Extra menu of the PaintCAD 4Windows graphic editor.  With the idea of ‚Äã‚Äã‚Äútired of drawing - get on the Internet, even at low speeds, on a hike, in a far point of the world where GPRS or another access mode / modem barely breathes‚Äù, Yota just emulated such a slow mode so that I could debug it continue to use. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/538/628/5a0/5386285a0c7882d2bdd5fa88fecc9deb.png"><br><br>  According to the canons of paintkad (graph editor with keyboard / touch controls), the browser had to be simultaneously controlled either from the keyboard, or the mouse, or from the touch screen, or from several of these devices in any combination. <br><br>  Holding the touchscreen tablet in both hands, the easiest thing was for me to click on the left and right edges of the screen ‚Äî so I placed browser control buttons along the edges of the screen.  In the middle of the screen is the web page drawing box itself (a component of Internet Explorer).  And above the input field of the address and under it the field with the page title. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/052/e80/fe3/052e80fe3a2e04c873728d926c910bf2.png"><br><br>  In many browsers, the stop download button and the Refresh button are combined into one.  Therefore, when a browser with such a button hangs up due to excessive efforts to load the page, and the text has loaded and you want to read it, clicking on such a button may work as Stop, or as a repeated Update, and will have to wait for the download again. <br><br>  Therefore, in the Bro browser, the Stop button and the Update button are two different buttons, both located in the upper left corner of the screen. <br><br><h3>  Control buttons on the left side of the screen </h3><br>  The <b>Stop</b> button also displays the progress of the page loading.  While the page is loading, the Stop button becomes active (turns red) and the progress indicator creeps inside the square icon on it.  When the download is complete, the Stop turns gray again, and at the bottom of the button the number of seconds that was spent on loading the page appears. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/05a/8d6/842/05a8d6842a5c119e55ef69edf0f7c7ef.png"><br><br>  Green button <b>Update</b> with star is always available.  The Back and Forward buttons with arrows become active and blue when you can climb backward or forward, respectively. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c44/5d1/d89/c445d1d89e1b827789836f9d5b0d31e7.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/06f/b1c/994/06fb1c994600396cf963cd9418e143d7.png"><br><br>  The button with the checkbox goes to the bookmarks page (by the way, the browser starts working on this page).  The same button with a checkbox and a ‚Äúplus‚Äù adds the current page to bookmarks. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/14a/241/484/14a241484a62705868902631c60ccff6.png"><br><br>  Edit <b>Bookmarks</b> (delete, swap) can be found in the bro.ini file, located in the folder of paintkad.  It is easy to get to it if you click the "Edit" link at the top of the bookmarks page.  After making corrections in the notepad in this file - the modified bookmarks will appear in the list after calling the "bookmarks" again. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/149/874/e6e/149874e6ec9e2918b7fd89b5cd183a9a.png"><br><br>  The most interesting button is half a button wide with a narrow arrow and mouse. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/30e/633/0a9/30e6330a91f2e062672c6298855b506c.png"><br><br>  <b>The ‚Äúmouse‚Äù</b> becomes red and active if you press <b>Ctrl + M</b> - then you can use the keyboard arrow to control the mouse cursor, press the left mouse button with the space bar, and press the right mouse button with the Z key.  If you want to control the browser from the keyboard, then without this mode, it will not be possible to normally and more or less quickly put the focus in the desired line / field on the web page, as well as click links.  Therefore this mode has been added. <br><br>  But the button ‚Äúwith a narrow arrow‚Äù, when you click on it, shows / hides the <b>virtual keyboard</b> on the lower half-screens, using it you can type texts in Russian and English on the touch screen (switching with the button Rus / Lat) in the address bar or in any fields of the browser: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/529/7a1/c07/5297a1c073cd7eecfba452d7d356ca9b.png"><br><br>  And the lowest button on the left is <b>‚ÄúClose‚Äù the</b> browser window. <br><br><h3>  Control buttons on the right side of the screen </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/285/227/31c/28522731c18d7f2f95516cc09f1bb480.png"><br><br>  On the 4 buttons, there is a <b>lever</b> on the right side <b>, with which you can scroll the page up or down</b> .  I don‚Äôt like the modern way of scrolling pages by scrolling multiple times with a finger on the screen.  I just wanted to click in one place on the screen - and so that the page itself went.  At rest, the lever is in the middle and the page is also worth it.  But it is necessary to press the lever above the middle of the field - and the page will go up, the farther from the middle - the faster the speed.  Similarly, clicking below the middle scrolls down the page. <br><br>  With the <b>Shift pressed,</b> the same lever controls the scale of the page display. <br><br>  If you press Up or Down on the keyboard, then the lever is deflected to some value specified in the program.  If at the same time hold <b>Ctrl</b> - then the lever will deviate much more.  And if you hold down <b>Alt</b> , then the page scrolling will take place not in the horizontal, but in the vertical direction (for some wide pages). <br><br>  If you screwed up the scale and you want to unscrew it back - then the combination <b>Ctrl + Shift + Down</b> will make not very small letters, but will reset the scale to 100%. <br><br>  Well, the last 4 buttons at the bottom right - it is to activate the pictures (flag DLCTL_DLIMAGES), flash (flags DLCTL_NO_DLACTIVEXCTLS and DLCTL_NO_RUNACTIVEXCTLS), java (DLCTL_NO_JAVA) and scripts (DLCTL_NO_RRACTACT_EXOJR_)  The buttons can be red (turned off) and green (turned on).  By default, they are all turned off and only text is loaded. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/5d9/952/922/5d9952922401407d6e1e54c85df2b4a4.png"><br><br>  Also, if you hold down <b>Alt</b> , then on the buttons on the left and on the right you will see keyboard shortcuts with which they are ‚Äúpressed‚Äù from the keyboard: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/094/cc5/a17/094cc5a17d4ca733c24301951c8d57ac.png"><br><br>  Also, if you press F10 - a single click on the address bar will be performed.  Therefore, <b>double-clicking F10</b> is to place the cursor in the address bar and select the entire current address (then press Backspace, delete it and enter another one). <br><br>  The lever from the keyboard works adequately only when the focus is in the address bar, if the focus lies inside the browser field - then you first need to press the double F10, and then just use the lever (press the physical keyboard up and down).  Otherwise, the browser field will interpret keystrokes on the navigation itself. <br><br><h3>  Fighting the Yota stub </h3><br>  If you have a free tariff, then every 24 hours Yota will slip a stub into the browser with a suggestion to change the tariff.  With pictures this business looks like this: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/805/b9c/39c/805b9c39c494990f93064ef86ff0b005.png"><br><br>  The goal is to scroll the page down, expand the page fragment with the free rate and click "Connect".  And then for the next 24 hours you have free 6 kilobytes per second. <br><br>  But by default, images are disabled - and without images it looks worse: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ad7/1f9/416/ad71f941678b357c2f7a6d1682a0a668.png"><br><br>  To open the fragments work, you need to enable Scripts (F9) and refresh the page.  Then get to the bottom of the page to the words ‚ÄúContinue at a slow speed‚Äù, press it and in the list that opens click the ‚ÄúConnect‚Äù button: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/001/a9e/573/001a9e5739c69a68529b5dd265463ba2.png"><br><br>  After that, you will automatically be transferred to the requested page, and the scripts can be disabled: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/1f8/d2b/4e9/1f8d2b4e93be30244d1b3b23211231c7.png"><br><br><h3>  IRC chat in the browser </h3><br>  Once upon a time I was on the Internet through the same dial-up modem and taking into account traffic.  And therefore, most of all I liked to sit in the IRC chat, or rather, in one of his clients - the little world (mIRC) - eats little traffic and is interesting.  In the world, you could write your own scripts (and any ready-made NoNaMe script was distributed), there were a lot of different settings, file transfer, etc.  etc. <br><br>  Nostalgia tortured me and I thought that through these 6 kb / s you can push through IRC traffic.  But IRC is such a thing, it can be colored and with text styles (bold, non-greasy, inverted, etc.).  Therefore, I wanted to display it straight to the browser.  It only remained to prepare a local file with the necessary coloring of the text and styles, and feed it to the browser every N sec during the update of the chat.  At the same time, it was necessary to turn the browser window to the very bottom in order to see what was added there. <br><br>  Calling an IRC client in a paintkad is made through the same Extra menu: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/649/94b/0f6/64994b0f630ad512cd1248633aa82809.png"><br><br>  After the call, a window with the main settings is displayed: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c35/eb9/6e3/c35eb96e361b2d3d1eaeab61cfd84609.png"><br><br>  Use the <b>Ctrl + 1 - Ctrl + 6</b> buttons to select one of the IRC networks. <br><br>  <b>The port number</b> affects the encoding of texts in the chat, usually 6667 is what you need, but if instead of Russian there are incomprehensible characters, then a table of encodings for each IRC network is displayed during connection (in transliteration, so that everyone understands, even those who got into IRC curve-encoded), and you will need to remember the port, pop out and enter it in the "Port" field. <br><br>  <b>Nickname</b> - your nickname in the chat.  You can press Ctrl + N to give the paintkad a nickname for you. <br><br>  <b>Password</b> - if your nickname is already registered, enter the password here and it will be transferred to the server after connecting as "/ ns identify password".  And if not, then you can enter nothing here.  In the IRC client itself, it is possible to enter a password after connecting to the server (see below). <br><br>  <b>User name</b> - here enter any email (you can your own, you can someone else). <br><br>  <b>Real name</b> - here we enter Vasya, Petya, Masha, etc. <br><br>  <b>Autologin on</b> - we enter the list of channels.  Channel names begin with a # sign and are separated by commas. <br><br>  <b>Font</b> - for those who do not like to peer at the screen, you can choose a different font name and a different size.  But generally I advise you to use monospaced fonts, since  in IRC, it is possible to draw pseudographics from characters and, with non-monospaced fonts, pseudographic images will skew and break horizontally. <br><br>  <b>Background</b> - you can sit in a chat on a black background (soothes your eyes, you sit like an oscilloscope), and you can read black texts on a white background.  An amateur, in general. <br><br>  At the end of the input, click <b>Connection (ENTER)</b> and wait. <br><br>  A browser window will appear, but in a new quality - an IRC client: now the line for entering text and commands is at the bottom.  Side buttons have other functions than in browser mode.  And the line "title of the site" now shows a list of channels on which you went. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/1ac/3b4/6cc/1ac3b46cc840a624ac99441267d76367.png"><br><br>  The chat window will first display information about the available commands of the IRC-client Retro (short help), and then the text from the server will appear.  This is a bunch of service information, the message of the day (message of the day, MOTD).  If the nickname is registered (like mine) - then a message will be issued about entering the password, otherwise your nickname Vasya, which is assigned to another person (and you don‚Äôt know his password), in a few minutes will turn into some sort of _Vasya so that you will not be confused with Vasya his friends. <br><br>  There are ‚Äúservices‚Äù in IRC (in particular, in the ircnet.ru network they are as described below, and in other networks they may have other names or they may be absent altogether): <br>  <b>NickServ</b> - manages registration of nicknames, change of passwords, change of information about yourself, requests for information about other registered nicknames <br>  <b>ChanServ</b> - manages the registration and deletion of channels (chat rooms) <br>  <b>MemoServ</b> - manages the transfer of messages to offline.  You can leave a message (and even several messages) to a registered user, and he will see a notification and be able to read these messages when logged in the next time. <br><br>  All services have a detailed help system - you just need to write the help command in the private service and he will answer you with this help in the chat.  For example, "/ w NickServ help" or "/ ns help".  Similar to "/ cs help" and "/ ms help". <br><br>  So, in <b>order to register your current nickname</b> , you need to write to the private NickServ service: <b>"/ w NickServ register password email"</b> or briefly <b>"/ ns register password email"</b> , where the password is your password and email is your email (you can enter any , but it is believed that in case of problems with IRC someone (server administrators or something) will communicate with you through it, although I have never seen such communication). <br><br>  And in order to enter your password when logging into IRC from a registered nickname, you need to write <b>"/ ns identify password"</b> .  For those who are too lazy to enter - the lower right button with an asterisk (F7) - it will enter everything for you ("/ ns identify") except your password, it remains to enter the password and press Enter: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/1fe/dd5/969/1fedd5969097f74a42811e998eec44ef.png"><br><br>  After identification, it will be written that everything is OK and you will even automatically be thrown onto your favorite channels: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/75c/73c/d1b/75c73cd1bcbd7afe111d903f1e36a852.png"><br><br>  Next to the asterisk button there is a button with an identity icon - this button allows you to view information about yourself as you are visible to other users: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/820/2c2/e8e/8202c2e8e0ed88fe8fc0f06e77779dd6.png"><br><br>  The button will call the whois command for your nickname, as well as more detailed information on the command "/ ns info nickname".  The results will come out in the chat. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ae3/a2b/0b6/ae3a2b0b6be97e98be14c2bdefe2220a.png"><br><br>  When you first log into IRC, you won‚Äôt be put on any channels.  What to do?  Write <b>"/ list&gt; 10"</b> - this will find all the channels on which more than 10 people are online, and will list to the chat: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/292/bca/0d1/292bca0d14f29040061b46cc9ee7546d.png"><br><br>  If the list is too long - you can interrupt the output by pressing any key on the keyboard.  The list shows the names of channels (starting with a # sign) and topics (themes) of channels.  In IRC, there are quiz channels in which a user bot sits and can be played with him, he makes riddles, anagrams, questions - and other users guess and score points, taking a certain place in the overall rating.  Also in IRC there are channels with bots for playing mafia, with bots telling jokes, with bots performing various funny commands, with bots clearing on request to Wikipedia and showing an excerpt of the text of the article you need, with bots showing the exact current time and etc. <br><br>  <b>To enter the channel,</b> you must enter <b>"/ join # name of the channel"</b> or <b>"/ j # name of the channel"</b> .  To exit the channel, you must enter <b>"/ part # channel name"</b> or <b>"/ p # channel name"</b> .  Each of the channels to which you have entered is assigned a unique number from 1 and above.  The list of current channels is displayed above the input line: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a13/388/a9b/a13388a9b18d946dc9cb131631f2631f.png"><br><br>  And the number of the current channel to which you write if you type something into the input line is displayed on the button at the top left of the window.  By pressing the button, the current channel number changes to the next.  Here is the button with the active third channel: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/485/b85/676/485b8567636d56206e6bbcdeb7965d25.png"><br><br>  Also, the channel number can be changed in the input field: if, for example, write in the chat <b>"/ 3"</b> and press the spacebar, then the channel will immediately change to the third. <br><br>  Accordingly, it is possible to access it from the channel by the number: <b>"/ p 2"</b> will allow you to leave channel number 2, and channel number 3 and the following will automatically decrease their number by one. <br><br>  To add any of the channels to your favorite list and to open them every time you enter the chat after entering the password, you need to write <b>"/ ns ajoin add # channel name"</b> .  You can also remove channels from your favorite list with the command <b>"/ ns ajoin del # channel name"</b> .  In order not to write such long commands - there are buttons on the left side of the screen: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/289/ece/a5e/289ecea5e65bf20d878a8f04229a2e10.png"><br><br>  These buttons will allow you to add the current channel to your favorite channel list or remove it from there.  After performing the operation, the command <b>"/ ns ajoin list" is</b> automatically called, which shows the channels remaining in the list of favorites. <br><br>  In the chat itself, you can just chat on the channel by typing text in the input field and pressing Enter.  And you can write to someone in <b>private</b> through the command <b>"/ w nickname text messages</b> . <b>"</b> <br><br>  The chat window can be minimized to the taskbar if you click the down arrow button on the left side of the screen: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/dbb/87f/737/dbb87f737fd6a17ee17128aa69589ab8.png"><br><br>  The current channel can be left without entering anything into the chat line, but simply by pressing the P button on the left side of the screen: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/179/034/043/1790340432d02faee8137d1f7e5ed66f.png"><br><br>  ‚ÄúInvites‚Äù are also common in IRC - this is when someone invites you to any channel.  You can confirm the invitation and enter the channel by clicking on the button with the letter ‚ÄúI‚Äù on the left side of the screen or by entering the chat "/ i": <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a43/302/b1b/a43302b1b6dbf8c1b580fa5078e997b4.png"><br><br>  Often, sitting in an IRC chat, people make not only friends, but also enemies, as well as those from whom I would like to hide.  The "+ i" button turns on stealth mode (invisible), by default it is turned on and it helps to hide some information about yourself, even, as far as I remember, to hide the fact of your login in the chat. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/baa/ddd/081/baaddd08164930a4ef59460ee58878fe.png"><br><br>  Sometimes in the chat they write something interesting and big.  But how to read this if the chat is scrolling down all the time?  The "C" button allows you to turn off the chat update for a while, while it will be updated, all messages will be received but not displayed on the screen until the chat update is turned on again: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/5ef/a0e/821/5efa0e821b00bcebcbfd8e1963043264.png"><br><br>  When entering a channel, a list of all channel users will be displayed in the chat.  But before some nicknames there will be a dog @, and in front of some plus +.  These are user rights on the channel. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/af4/9c6/b3f/af49c6b3ffc3a62950f9ebae3ab47f9a.png"><br><br>  <b>"@"</b> Is the "op" channel operator, it can kick everyone, ban by nick and even by mask, change the channel settings, etc. <br>  <b>"+"</b> Is "voice" (voice), it can talk on the channel even when the "silent except for opov" channel mode is on. <br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">A white nickname without everything is a regular user. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Also in some IRC networks there are nicknames with a dot in front of a nickname - these are half-op, semi-operators, operators with reduced rights. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">All user rights are checkboxes. The same invisibility is the + i flag. Registered user - checkbox + r. The operator on the channel - check box + o. The voice on the channel is + v.</font></font> And so on.<font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">There are also checkboxes for channels that allow you to define channel settings. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Not all checkboxes, but some can be switched from oneself, from other users or channels (if you have rights) through the </font></font><b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">"/ mode nickname / channel ¬± flags"</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> command </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">, where checkboxes with pluses are those that are turned on, and checkboxes with minuses - those that turn off. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">If you prank a lot in IRC and swear at anyone, you can get on IRCop, IRC-op, he usually has much broader rights not only on any channel, but also generally on the server. Therefore, you can get K-line (permanent ban on this server) or G-line (global permanent ban on all servers of this IRC network) from irkop. Therefore, it is better to look at the user information first via / ns info or whois, it will usually be written there that he is an irkop.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">If you are suddenly disconnected from IRC, then at the next call you will receive a message that such a nickname is already logged in, and your nickname will immediately become with some sort of symbol "_nik". </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">This means that your last session (ghost, ghost) remained hanging. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">You can wait about three minutes and she will fall off herself, or write the command </font></font><b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">"/ ns ghost nickname password"</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> to kill the last session and change the nickname to your daily command </font></font><b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">"/ nick vannik"</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> .</font></font><br><br><h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> Downloading files through Yota </font></font></h3><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Once, when I did not have a dial-up modem, I ran to an ‚ÄúInternet cafe‚Äù with a pack of floppy disks, to pump up the most there, to pack into several volumes a RAR archive with recovery information, and to drag home on diskettes (breaking on the way half of them and then for a long time restoring these archives). Then, when the dial-up modem appeared, I was sitting at home, staring at the monitor, leaving to drink tea and waited a long time for the next MP3 song to be downloaded. 20 minutes rocked five megabytes - and here it is, my dear, lies with me! </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">You can feel it again if you use the free Yota. Therefore, in the paintkad, the ‚ÄúSpecials‚Äù menu was created, where I began to put not so much entertainment as utility tools. The utility "Download file" is just there:</font></font><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/25f/9ab/bd6/25f9abbd683cf1c89832ebfc80aa67c8.png"><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The direct link it will be able to download your any file (through it is updated paintkad, if you check for updates and paintkad will tell you that a new version): </font></font><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b68/9bd/cd3/b689bdcd33aaf09c0e0f3ec8549c43b4.png"><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And you can long enjoy the download speed and the remaining time (of course you can download files from links directly from your browser, then the standard IE boot loader will open, but then you will not see all these details accurate to kilobytes and bytes):</font></font><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/438/2ca/247/4382ca247a608b5b84aef94a2bbd93ee.png"><br><br><h3>  Time synchronization </h3><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Many will say "this feature is built into Windows." </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Yes, but the workstand works in any Windows since Windows 95 (if you have ie4.0), and in those dense Windows this feature was not. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Therefore, in the "Special" menu there is an item "Time Synchronization". </font></font><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/146/279/9ad/1462799adf2dd50c5d440945a91535e2.png"><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Enter the name of any NTP server (by default, one of the servers has already been entered) and press Enter. </font></font><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/bde/9c9/05e/bde9c905e822657db02cdce540f35da6.png"><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And if the server is online now, a message about successful synchronization will be displayed, and even the time BEFORE and AFTER the synchronization to evaluate how much your PC is lagging behind / in a hurry.</font></font><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/636/cd0/2a7/636cd02a753da7d439d116548ba579d4.png"><br><br><h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> Raw site log analyzer </font></font></h3><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Sometimes in field conditions I want to evaluate the traffic to my site. We download logs and call the command "Analyzer of raw-site logs" in the menu "Extra-Special". </font></font><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b60/ef5/d66/b60ef5d66a02545d05796ebf486fe909.png"><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">We specify the log file and enter the search filter. You can enter a file name, or you can also use a date (or something else) through the vertical bar. All log lines will be searched and filtered to match all parts of the filter string.</font></font> Those.<font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">the vertical bar here is a logical I. For example, ‚Äúfile.txt | 10 / sep‚Äù is a search for statistics on the file file.txt only for the date of September 10th. </font></font><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c7b/bfc/1ac/c7bbfc1ac2c4d15d43d0624c9689c2e7.png"><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Paintkad will rustle progress indicator and open analysis results in your standard browser. In principle, the result will be in the root directory of the paintkad in the rawlog.htm file, so you can open it even in the Bro browser (via the Extra - Special - Open the file in the Bro browser) command. </font></font><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/595/345/cfd/595345cfdee711b1026d0cc78d1c4c27.png"><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">First, it returns all the found lines (if the filter was set to empty, then this section will not be, because why pour out all the lines of the log at all). </font></font><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/02d/d12/221/02dd1222166d10fb4e86dea3536951c3.png"><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Then comes the rating section for queries: </font></font><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b2c/b01/13f/b2cb0113f13734cc8b842d81d270422b.png"><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Then the ranking of links on sites that link to your file:</font></font><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/faa/b6f/0d0/faab6f0d0169146c454e27a213e5d565.png"><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Then the rating of appeals by dates. Moreover, these are just calls, because they can be downloaded by any download manager who downloads a file in parallel, and thus the file will be downloaded once, and there will be 10 downloads (from zero byte, from 1000 byte, from 2000 byte and t .d.) </font></font><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/9ae/8b7/cf0/9ae8b7cf012619490bc53d8ed90da494.png"><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Well, in the end - rating by browsers (on the agent line): </font></font><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/2a1/dc6/f6b/2a1dc6f6b8dd8d3c4aa411d0c9f194e4.png"><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The parser was written for a specific log line format, but after reading different texts about log formats, it seemed to me that there are abbreviated log formats (when the string is shortened, the parameters in it are smaller), in them the log analyzer may not work properly.</font></font><br><br><h3>  Conclusion </h3><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">A year has passed since December 2012, when Bro's browser became a reality. And later tightened and other utilities. Now, sitting or even standing in a clogged train, I can get a laptop out of my bag with my little finger, turn the screen outside, stick a keychain in my laptop, and sit free in forums, news sites, blogs and even IRC chat, and also download files, synchronize time and view site logs. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">If you want to do the same, if you have cases where only slow internet is available, if you like IRC chat with output of all the channels in the world of warcraft style in one window, then you can also use all these utilities in the Extra "Paintkad.</font></font><br><br><h3>  Links </h3><br> <b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The latest version of the paintkad 1.2.3.922 (11 megabytes)</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> lies at: </font></font><a href=""><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">blackstrip.ru/pcw.rar</font></font></a> <br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> There is also </font></font><b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">beta 1.2.4</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> (the lonely exe file that you are recommended to throw into the folder with the installed patch 1.2.3), lies at: </font></font><a href=""><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">blackstrip. ru / paintcad.exe</font></font></a> <br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> And, by the way, this is a graphic editor, and in it you can still draw pixel art, make and parse gif-animations, png with translucency, assemble avi-files from frames and disassemble avi-files into frames, draw 3d-pictures and animations, work with 3d MPO and JPS formats, take photos and videos on webcam. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">But this is another story that goes beyond the scope of this article.</font></font></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/202606/">https://habr.com/ru/post/202606/</a></p>
