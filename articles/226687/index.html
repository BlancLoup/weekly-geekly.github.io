Yes.  Now we know that Piggs are Decepticons.  And, judging by the fact that the pigs are sitting in their own self-built houses and constructing cars, we are dealing with constructivons (certainly, even more valuable knowledge!).  For the rest, what exactly should be expected from the union of Rovio and Hasbro is not yet known, the company is silent, without naming even the approximate time of exit.

      In addition to the game, which is quite expected, since both companies are quite adept at releasing toys, a new line of interactive Telepods will be released.  With them you can not only poteteshkatsya, but also activate with their help the life-giving additional content in the game (an approach similar to that used in Skylanders).  Well, it remains only to wait patiently for the coming of the war of auto-patrons and decepticians. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h4>  Candy Crush - Now With Soda Flavor </h4><br>  The gods of match3 and in combination with the entire mobile gaming market continue their victorious march across the expanses of our phones.  Not so long ago, King tried to sue studios that use the words "candy" and "saga" in the names of their games.  And now they have decided to get up themselves as the second carriage after their own locomotive.  If the players like it, then let's give them what they love. <br><br>  June 10, a continuation of their most popular game appeared on Google Play - <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details%3Fid%3Dcom.king.candycrushsodasaga">Candy Crash Soda Saga</a> .  More than 93 million players around the world play the original daily, and their monthly audience is over a billion players! <br><br>  For 2013, the game brought King 1.5 billion dollars in revenue.  A sequel was to appear!  And the new game is beautiful!  They saved everything that match3 players love so much, and added new mechanics without killing the simplicity of the game.  The game itself with external similarity has become an order of magnitude more beautiful and more difficult in graphic terms, effects and possibilities of levels.  Now the game is available only in Canada.  But, let's say in secret, the .apk file with the game can already be found on the Internet.  We are waiting for the appearance of the game on iOS and the opening of the whole world. <br><br><br><h4>  Mobile games - now also in TOP on E3 </h4><br>  The most popular exhibition of video games died down, and, although the overall focus of the exhibition is shifted towards the console and PC market, this did not prevent several serious titles from being displayed on mobile platforms.  GameSpot offered a <a href="http://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-5-most-intriguing-mobile-games-at-e3-2014/1100-6420512/">selection of the</a> most interesting titles that will soon appear on the mobile market.  And we decided to talk briefly about them: <br><br>  <b>Hitman: Sniper</b> from Square-Enix, will allow us to play the role of the notorious assassin, the gameplay is much closer to the original than the previously released Hitman GO. <br><br>  Capcom's <b>Monster Hunter Freedom Unite</b> , a hardcore action-rpg port from a PSP handheld console about killing huge monsters.  The original of the game was not particularly friendly to the player in terms of management, I wonder how Capcom will solve this problem, which will be even bigger on touchscreens. <br><br>  Wargaming showed a mobile version of <b>World of Tanks Blitz</b> tanks.  The game is already available in the soft-launch in several countries, and soon the tank battles will unfold on tablets all over the world.  The developers promise a completely redesigned and adapted interfaces, easy management and good graphics, apparently, Wargaming seriously approached the business of conquering the mobile market for tanks. <br><br>  <b>The Witcher Adventure Game</b> - no, this is not just another action-rpg in the Witcher universe, this is a full-fledged port of a table card game, which should also be released for PC at the end of this year.  We promise a developed mechanics and design from the eminent Ignacy Tshevichek, the creator of many popular board games. <br><br>  If you wanted to try the famous actions of <b>Gods of War</b> or <b>Ryse: Son of Rome</b> , but did not have such an opportunity, then <b>Godfire: Rise of Prometheus</b> should be a good alternative for tablets.  Greek gods, immortals, Titans, battles, blood - all this is mixed up with the help of the Unreal Engine.  We are promised a great picture and convenient control, the game should definitely come out for fans of such entertainment. <br><br><br><h4>  World of Tanks - now on mobile </h4><br>  The long-awaited news for World of Tanks fans!  On June 26, iOS will host the world release of a mobile version of the famous tank-based online game, World of Tanks Blitz.  The announcement of this appeared on Wargaming's official <a href="https://twitter.com/WoTBlitz/status/476414192896188416">twitter</a> account, without specifying any release details. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b84/6bd/d54/b846bdd54eef431249a3404f0a029958.jpg"><br><br>  Note that the World of Tanks Blitz is made with all the features of mobile devices, but, according to the developers, we are waiting for exactly the same physics, the same maps and models of tanks, the same dynamics!  Players will participate in battles 7 for 7 on more than 90 different combat vehicles of the middle of the last century - anti-tank SAU, light, medium and heavy tanks of the USA, Germany and the USSR. <br><br>  I would like to note that, according to Wargaming, the game has collected over 150,000 applications for testing, and this is only for the first week.  Indeed, this game has a huge audience on the PC, and it will be interesting to see how it will meet the mobile version, because the game is not cross-platform and you have to start all over again. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/226687/">https://habr.com/ru/post/226687/</a></p>
