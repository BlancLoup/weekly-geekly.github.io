  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Cape Town Science Center: Polytechnic Museum, where you have to press all the buttons</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"> I am currently studying local board games in South Africa.  It so happened that there are quite a lot of them at the local <b>scientific center</b> .  Naturally, I could not resist, and walked around the center, asking questions.  It's just some kind of wild delight: here you can touch everything, touch, run and check. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ddd/dd6/735/ddddd673542145fc076c38f332e85b8e.jpg"><br><br>  <b>What is the coolest, almost everything here is suitable for children.</b>  For them, this is generally an adventure - to get into the spacecraft, to launch the pneumatic rocket, to control the ball with a neuroactuator, to beat it through pipes and so on.  Just a brilliant way to spark interest in science from 4-5 years.

      Caution <b>traffic</b> : there are a lot of photos below. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  It all starts with a <b>black hole</b> model.  It is necessary to throw a ball (planet) and see how it will turn around for a long time and nicely, until somewhere within a minute its spiral trajectory converges.  The child below catches his planetoid: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/9ef/8a0/1f2/9ef8a01f24bbd913cbe5e8f0427518cb.jpg"><br><br>  <b>Railway</b> , where you can run the train: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c2a/377/e43/c2a377e43fd109ff5e4e2401b3eb5e49.jpg"><br><br>  <b>Parabolic plate</b> .  A few meters away - the second.  You have to get into tricks and listen to what your friend is whispering from the other side: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a77/d2f/20f/a77d2f20fbf100cee355a4202ddd381e.jpg"><br><br>  <b>Neuroactuator</b> .  You wrap a dry bandage around your head, press a button, and a powerful magnet begins to move below the table.  The task is to drag the ball towards the opponent.  Above shows a graph of alpha brain waves.  It is necessary to concentrate as much as possible: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/012/d82/157/012d82157d76d3d9e6ebcec4284d4f1c.jpg"><br><br>  Naturally, my little opponent could not stand it and grabbed the ball with his hands in order not to let it into the goal.  Nearby is the difference in our alpha waves.  I tried to play along, but failed. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/325/f07/ece/325f07ecef4fd0617c48a9ca7b417c7e.jpg"><br><br>  And this is a <b>musical labyrinth</b> .  You throw balls at the top, watch them jump through all the sections.  From time to time they either ring the bell, then knock on the resonating plate, then roll over the metallophone.  The idea is old, we even had visiting masters who make such things in the form of balls about 30 centimeters in diameter to order.  Well, there are the usual labyrinth balls on sale too: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/903/4b1/032/9034b10327b76953220673dd57c71e78.jpg"><br><br>  <b>Here you just need to push the straight bar into the bent hole.</b>  In reality, the gap pattern is very objective, because with your head you realize that it will pass, but when you do it right with your hands, something changes.  This ‚Äúsomething‚Äù distinguishes theory from school from practical understanding when you have the thing in your hands.  And immediately - the theory below. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/7da/a67/dda/7daa67dda076712e6c0b45c425808d14.jpg"><br><br>  Yes, and while you look at this picture, rate the plate.  Such signs with "What to do", "See what is happening", "Why" and "Why" are in each exhibit.  Pay attention - empirical experience turns into real practical applications. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/76f/856/d8b/76f856d8b37ad2437c2e7c02116714a1.jpg"><br><br>  But the <b>electric corridor</b> .  First we are met by a wire in the cut.  A screen is installed on the cut, which shows the animation of how electrons run around the wire: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f8f/ee0/08c/f8fee008c98019514ebcfc5c1da86088.jpg"><br><br>  Everything you wanted to know about <b>radiation</b> .  Stand in a crowd of people, often fly higher and climb a little more on Table Mountain, where there is a lot of granite.  Pay attention to the signature about cell phones.  The museum also either sponsors, or sponsors Samsung - and now they have found a completely cool placement.  There is still the largest working cell phone in the world nearby - also a brick from this company of a person‚Äôs height. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/2e8/691/49b/2e869149b68ebe3a67b5f772100b1a45.jpg"><br><br>  Well, so as not to go far - a moving <b>model of the reactor</b> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/290/07e/864/29007e86441571a5a9c65ecca1a70413.jpg"><br><br>  And here at all cool.  The infrared sensor sees the person and turns on the fans in the near compartment.  It is necessary to raise a wind trap (panel on the suspension) in order for the lamp to work on this suspension.  The second compartment - also the lamp lights up on the sensor, and you need to raise the solar panel to make the fans work in the compartment.  The idea is wildly simple and insanely cool for learning. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/34f/2c2/6d1/34f2c26d12f32ac1b21df9d3862549d6.jpg"><br><br>  <b>Electrolysis</b> .  You can click a button and see how everything works.  At the same time it is necessary to rotate the handle: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/3ab/6bf/ab4/3ab6bfab47e985e49c90630039edb7ea.jpg"><br><br>  <b>Experience with the wave</b> .  Download the fig with the gel, look for the waveform.  Balls - a tribute to tablet games, where they are often found on such objects. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/351/739/1cd/3517391cd95f158ddc3bfb0ff065d1e8.jpg"><br><br>  Go ahead.  Here is a variation of the game <b>Ubergo</b> , somehow localized by us, where you need to put the figures in places.  This is a very childish version.  In general, the African folk game Ubongo in Africa, as it turned out, is unknown to anyone.  But as soon as you show what to do (it is necessary to put the figures, as in Tetris, from other figures), everyone says that he has known her since childhood, and everyone calls a different name. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/0f7/57e/cc1/0f757ecc127d0cc5ea806d799d3568f2.jpg"><br><br>  In the museum, these variations of Ubongo pieces five, probably from simple to complex. <br><br>  And this is the <b>hall for schoolchildren</b> .  An entire school classroom is sometimes driven here, and they conduct various experiments. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/789/f4c/4ae/789f4c4ae26dc72405bc96cda6a33ec2.jpg"><br><br>  Here today will be a lesson on sounds.  Center teachers are already preparing adventures: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/3e5/268/b3f/3e5268b3fee78b091791107c9342c53f.jpg"><br><br>  And here are the guys who will teach children. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/078/12c/0f5/07812c0f58851ad2a0fc15f36c987124.jpg"><br><br>  Go ahead.  A little space.  At first - well rumpled <b>descent vehicle</b> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e45/4bf/841/e454bf841952b6f95c9db2463388b2b5.jpg"><br><br>  <b>Then "Union".</b>  A copy, of course.  But in the place of our Roskosmos, I would distribute a copy to every scientific museum of the world so that they know who was the first in space.  And then the local Gagarin did not even react, but they immediately made a stand on Armstrong. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/bf5/8d4/73b/bf58d473b2b61f757b635b16211beddc.jpg"><br><br>  Useful things in life that were originally made for space.  In particular, the famous pen, about which goes so many tales: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/322/e98/ed9/322e98ed95d9355b64e38a461a31289e.jpg"><br><br>  <b>A bunch of different pipes for sounds</b> .  Specifically, it is necessary to beat on these with the attached slipper, so that it would please: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/8e1/a6c/4f0/8e1a6c4f006a29dc4b5ce37d4ea801bf.jpg"><br><br>  Hall of indie music and creativity: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/331/7b1/2fb/3317b12fbf38b8cc45f78bfc260f05a4.jpg"><br><br>  And aaa-aaa-aa!  Here the child can stick his own badges: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/345/545/add/345545add5336af258863765a70c8841.jpg"><br><br>  <b>Experiments with color and light</b> (for the most part, we have them in children's scientific sets - like chemical experiments, they are easy to buy, since nothing dangerous or mega-complicated): <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/8a1/956/c09/8a1956c09f4425e073bebb382c3ba3c0.jpg"><br><br>  The game "Ludo": <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f82/bba/984/f82bba9843ee65a454f3a4bd4901e621.jpg"><br><br>  <b>Heat transfer</b> .  Put your fingers on one side - look at the indicator. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/7cf/45a/d14/7cf45ad149c400b6bfe72ec10265eb4a.jpg"><br><br>  <b>The game "Snakes and Ladders"</b> - a very simple hodilka for those who are just learning to count: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/931/8fb/580/9318fb58053365d414ba446aeb74c027.jpg"><br><br>  <b>A childhood dream</b> - experiments with particles and static electricity. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/996/0f4/702/9960f47023a4b1392aedf7846a96dca0.jpg"><br><br>  <b>CD model</b> at high magnification: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/510/473/d00/510473d0004c93285a4fda76e926c92b.jpg"><br><br>  Another, already unfamiliar to me variation from the group ‚ÄúUbongo‚Äù: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/80f/1ff/d6f/80f1ffd6fe6c98bf77268422ec30b130.jpg"><br><br>  <b>Stand with a head on a dish</b> - a table with mirrors.  Come in from behind, poke your head - and now the photo is ready. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/083/264/579/083264579e9a6b19a7b3bd51457f4810.jpg"><br><br>  Again the game (this time from our range).  What is incredibly pleased, here, on the other side of the world, they use exactly the same chips as we do.  These decorative stones, by the way, are still very popular with aquarists for some reason. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/00e/cd8/270/00ecd8270c02d0d5f64d1d557cea72a0.jpg"><br><br>  Fish.  <b>Two aquariums</b> .  Just a mega-wise decision.  Communication with nature is especially important here. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c2d/1dc/1c4/c2d1dc1c41c07c4607432b3ebca8fb38.jpg"><br><br>  This is not the Tardis, but a wardrobe with technical literature: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/222/d77/35e/222d7735e9fd1a0da7c80a916a6ed19f.jpg"><br><br>  <b>Bottle</b> - the national Russian tool.  Well, at least they tried to convince me of that. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/9a1/042/817/9a104281720279e54f96458875ce55e2.jpg"><br><br>  <b>Megatyazhny rink</b> , which rises along these guides here.  And the cylinder is rolling down the back.  You shrug those - you will immediately remember the physics.  In general, almost everywhere here, the interactive borders on gaming. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/9e7/09e/8cc/9e709e8ccb04dd1092184acfda1c7666.jpg"><br><br>  <b>Lego corner</b> .  Along the way, they sponsor the center.  Details from small go to large (behind).  Nearby are tables with Lego pimples - it is very convenient to start assembling directly on them. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/154/6c4/d18/1546c4d1870c76eaddff9a7c31cccf52.jpg"><br><br>  <b>Corner sadist.</b>  In fact, of course, you just need to know about the pressure.  It‚Äôs not painful to lie down on such a bed.  On the last picnic at the Exhibition of Economic Achievements, someone put up such a chair, as I remember: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b40/6d9/439/b406d943934004f2d83e293e28b02a57.jpg"><br><br>  A good old device for determining whether horses have a soaring gallop.  If it were not for the perennial bet of two stubborn gentlemen who designed this device, we would not be able to see the modern animation. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/6c4/3ed/bf1/6c43edbf1c402f7ddaeefc0ca90861da.jpg"><br><br>  A ball that does not fall: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/9e9/b30/c16/9e9b30c165510ca0cb906581a67b7f7c.jpg"><br><br>  <b>Hardcore task.</b>  It's also good to touch with your fingers.  Weakly solve? <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c38/07c/cbb/c3807ccbb205b6eb68944e206dd25c73.jpg"><br><br>  Beautiful <b>infrared harp</b> : <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/9f8/79e/856/9f879e856b039cb035efe8b959eba44d.jpg"><br><br>  Cross the beam instead of the string - it plays a sample: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f00/c94/ac7/f00c94ac7b89e5f6d00091ba3d531c88.jpg"><br><br>  <b>The most interesting place for children</b> .  You pull up the bottle, you drive compressed air into it, you release it - and the rocket flies by 10-15 meters of rope.  While we were localizing Alcatraz, we learned that this method of transmitting letters on ropes is called ‚Äúlet the horse.‚Äù  Pshhshshshsh-vzhuh! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f6d/755/d5e/f6d755d5e0a2dfe32a8561b1d9eaa7cc.jpg"><br><br>  <b>Rack with working construction equipment</b> .  They are built everywhere in South Africa, so the stand is social.  Surely develops interest in the profession: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/aee/30a/c0d/aee30ac0d95004abbd9c779b242cd788.jpg"><br><br>  Well, a bunch of <b>terminals for</b> different purposes: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a1b/5d1/edd/a1b5d1edd6b1d16e79180b9afbdef40e.jpg"><br><br>  Now we go to the <b>class of robotics</b> .  Here, children learn to make a robot and program it little by little. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/fac/7e1/797/fac7e1797574d634df2def0987ede5dd.jpg"><br><br>  On the screen - a hint how to collect.  Here are the results: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d20/503/be0/d20503be061eac174c203e57982b6a28.jpg"><br><br>  Slightly closer details: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/57a/3a3/579/57a3a357957066d4f20a5e5eb9e71c5e.jpg"><br><br>  At the exit a couple of posters with local infographics: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/414/baa/f45/414baaf45fa998d0417fd53fc186b278.jpg"><br><br>  In the shop at the center there are such cool things.  You can physically fold one second, one third and two twelve. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ef0/de5/f02/ef0de5f021c6ce82f6e09fd99f8426d1.jpg"><br><br>  <b>But at the exit the coolest collection of donations for science, which I saw:</b> "Look how your money sucks into a black hole."  It is necessary to throw a coin and enthusiastically observe the process: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/7c9/1ee/f8e/7c91eef8e0cc569756a0e0e0a938f669.jpg"><br><br>  Everything.  I learned quite a bit about board games here, but we have a teaching science project in Mosigra - and I learned quite a lot for him just now.  And the very atmosphere of the place where children can run freely and do anything, is very happy.  In general, do not miss this place if you find yourself near the Cape of Good Hope. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/217757/">https://habr.com/ru/post/217757/</a></p>
