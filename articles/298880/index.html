With it, advertisers will be able to place ads without intermediaries, referring directly to one or another blogger. <br><br>  The Bloggers Exchange allows the advertiser to select the desired blogger from the list by special criteria (audience, subject, post cost), set a specific brand promotion task for him, approve the post before publication, and also receive an analytical report on the campaign in his account. <br><br>  For example, select authors by subject and target audience (the service will offer a base of 5,000 bloggers), determine the format of cooperation, and then follow the entire campaign using the reporting system.  Service solution provided by the company DigitalMagic, <a href="https://lenta.ru/news/2016/02/24/lj/">writes the</a> publication Lenta.ru.

      ‚ÄúThe introduction of a new instrument makes the process of payment and receipt of money between the parties as transparent and fast as possible,‚Äù Rambler &amp; Co said. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  By connecting to the Bloggers Exchange, authors can receive invitations to press tours, requests for testing products and services directly from brands.  This will allow them to "first-hand" take material for their posts on the site and earn money on it. <br><br>  In Rambler &amp; Co they note that the introduction of such a tool as an exchange makes the process of payment and receipt of money between the advertiser and the blogger as transparent and fast as possible. <br><br>  ‚ÄúNow the Russian marketing industry has a modern tool for setting tasks for the blog community and creating content about its products: from a test drive of a new car or smartphone to a review of a new hotel in another city,‚Äù said Maxim Tadevosyan, first deputy general director of Rambler &amp; Co. <br><br>  Register on the exchange can any user LJ.  To register, he needs to confirm that he is a tax resident of the Russian Federation.  The rules indicate that a blogger receives at his own expense 62% of the total amount of remuneration after paying personal income tax (13%), insurance premiums (27.1%) and LJ commission (15%).  ‚ÄúLiveJournal‚Äù also takes a commission from the advertiser.  However, it is not fixed, but will be calculated depending on the complexity of the advertising campaign. <br><br>  As follows from the LJ <a href="http://medius.livejournal.com/video/album/498/%3Fmode%3Dview%26id%3D386">video message</a> , at the moment about 16 million users visit the exchange every month. <br><br>  The <a href="http://rambler-co.ru/live/v-zhivom-zhurnale-otkrylasi-birzha-blogerov">press release</a> contains Maxim Tadevosyan‚Äôs comment on the prospects of the new project: <br><blockquote>  ‚ÄúDue to the fact that information noise is growing, and direct advertising often does not lead to an increase in confidence in the product, it was decided to help our partners and colleagues.  We expect that the Bloggers Exchange can become popular not only among brands, but also among novice authors, for whom life at LiveJournal.com can become not only a hobby, but also a new line of income in a personal budget. ‚Äù </blockquote><br>  <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2596%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B2%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B9_%25D0%2596%25D1%2583%25D1%2580%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BB">LiveJournal</a> is a blogging platform for online diaries (blogs), as well as a separate personal blog hosted on this platform.  The platform has existed since 1999.  Until December 2012, there was no mandatory advertising in free blogs in LiveJournal. <br><br>  LiveJournal is subject to US law, since its servers are located in the United States and the system belongs to the American company LiveJournal, Inc., although it has been owned by the Russian company <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/SUP_Media">Rambler-Afisha-SUP</a> since 2013. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/298880/">https://habr.com/ru/post/298880/</a></p>
