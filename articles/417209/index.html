  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Neural networks from scratch. Overview of courses and articles in Russian, free of charge and without registration</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  On Habr√© periodically appear reviews of courses on machine learning.  But such articles are more often bookmarked than the courses themselves.  The reasons for this are different: courses in English, require a confident knowledge of matane or specific frameworks (or, on the contrary, the initial knowledge necessary to complete the course is not described), are on other sites and require registration, have a schedule, homework and are difficult to combine with workdays .  All this prevents from now from scratch to begin to dive into the world of machine learning with its own speed, exactly to the level that is interesting and at the same time to skip uninteresting sections. <br><br>  In this review basically there are only links to articles on Habr√©, and links to other resources as an add-on (information on them in Russian and do not need to be registered).  I read all the articles and materials I recommended personally.  I tried each video course to choose what I like and help the others.  Most of the articles I have read before, but there are also those that I stumbled upon while writing this review. <br><br>  The review consists of several sections so that everyone can choose the level from which to start. <br>  For large sections and video courses, approximate time costs, necessary knowledge, expected results and tasks for self-examination are indicated.

If you see that you know some part of the article, then you can safely skip it, if you did not go bankrupt with this information in the previous article, then you have a chance to read the same thing, but in other words, which should help the absorption of the material. <br><br><h4>  Introductory articles </h4><br>  Required level: school education, knowledge of Russian language. <br>  Required time: a few hours. <br><br>  It would seem that it is worth starting the study with the article <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2598%25D1%2581%25D0%25BA%25D1%2583%25D1%2581%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B0%25D1%258F_%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B9%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B0%25D1%258F_%25D1%2581%25D0%25B5%25D1%2582%25D1%258C">Artificial Neural Network</a> on Wikipedia, but I do not recommend it.
