  <section class="page js-page"><h1>We get a passport through gosuslugi.ru (part 2)</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/f08b990c/920dc4b5/4bd30289/aab2d3a7.png" align="left">  Not so long ago, I wrote a <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/e_gov/127524/">topic</a> in which I described the first part of my experience in obtaining a passport through the innovation portal of public services.  The other day, the desired document was received, and as promised, I bring the rest of the story.  In addition, under the cat will be collected the most useful notes and tips that habrupayezhy left in the comments to the previous topic.  Before continuing reading, I strongly advise you to familiarize yourself with the previous topic. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h1>  Finally successful application </h1>  In the <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/e_gov/127524/">comments, the</a> habra user named <a href="http://geektimes.ru/users/molodoy/" class="user_link">molodoy</a> suggested that it turns out that there is a <a href="http://epgu.gosuslugi.ru/pgu/">secret address for the</a> new version of the portal on which everything should work stably.  In this version, the orientation is obviously made on a touch-device (first of all, apparently, for terminals installed in the offices of Rostelecom), however, there was no particular inconvenience when filling from a regular computer.  Moreover, there were no bugs when trying to submit an application, and after a few minutes, it safely went for consideration! <br><br><h1>  Photographing </h1>  After a day or two, a notification came to the post office saying that my application was accepted for processing, and a date was set for a come-in photo.  Also in this letter were listed all the necessary documents for registration.  Therefore, after collecting all the papers, on the appointed day (about two and a half weeks after submitting the application), I went first to the Sberbank branch to pay the fee, and then to the FMS department.  The first stop, of course, pleased little: the terminals did not work, and the queue was delayed for half an hour.  I still do not understand why the fee can not be paid in normal banks.  But in the department everything turned out to be simple and fast: he even entered a couple of minutes ahead of the time indicated in the letter, gave all the documents, took a photo and left: the whole procedure took less than five minutes.  Stuffed up in ink and glue, the people who were tormented by hand-filled questionnaires looked at me with some sadness.  I didn‚Äôt have time to shut up that I took a picture of my carbon passport, when a notification was again dropped to the post office that the passport was being processed.

    <h1>  Getting </h1>  In a letter that came in nine days, there was an invitation to pick up a passport, the address at which it should be done, and even the reception hours.  There was no queue, I just came, put the signature in two places, and left, but with a passport.  <b>So, it took an hour to fill in the questionnaire in the ‚Äúsitting in front of the monitor‚Äù mode and two visits to the FMSA for a total duration of less than ten minutes.</b>  In general, it is pleasant, within a reasonable time and convenient. <br><br><h1>  Potentially interesting and useful information. </h1><ul><li>  It turns out that the flashing banner on the public services page is actually a link to the second version of the portal, and not an indicator that we are on it now: <img src="http://www.gosuslugi.ru/common/upload/news/epgu_banner.gif"></li><li>  My complaint about the unfair rejection of the application was not answered at all. </li><li>  When filling in workplaces, you need to write even a school, if it was less than 10 years ago. </li><li>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/e_gov/127524/">They say</a> that the passage without a queue rolls is not always: habrayuzer <a href="http://geektimes.ru/users/gangsta/" class="user_link">Gangsta</a> stood in the queue for 7 hours. </li><li>  <a href="http://geektimes.ru/users/lexmirnov/" class="user_link">Lexmirnov</a> <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/e_gov/127524/">suggests</a> that the list of documents sent in the letter may be incomplete </li><li>  According to data from the user <a href="http://geektimes.ru/users/lampus/" class="user_link">Lampus</a> , when you click "Back" statement <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/e_gov/127524/">may lose data</a> . </li></ul><br><br>  That's all.  Of course, there is little important content in the topic, but I modestly believe that some of the people will find some information useful. <br><br>  <b>Have a happy holiday abroad!</b> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/129382/">https://habr.com/ru/post/129382/</a></p>
