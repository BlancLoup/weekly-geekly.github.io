You need to approach the process of creating a logo with all the responsibility, because by it the potential buyer will judge the quality of your products.  It is especially difficult to create a logo focused on products for children. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/877/69a/0e6/87769a0e62398fe676d1097a51a7e452.jpg"><br><br>  Our little beetle <a href="http://littlebeetle.net/ru/">Little Beetle</a> has already learned and loved thousands of children around the world.  We want to share the story of the creation of this logo, the story of the appearance of a small green bug in the pilot's cap.  This bug has become not only a symbol of the company for the development of mobile children's applications, but also allowed to take the company to a new level.

    <a name="habracut"></a>  Previously, our company was known by a completely different name - <b>Style Mobile Studio</b> .  Among our software products were games, books, and reference books.  Now we have gained enough experience in order to <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/littlebeetle/blog/167329/">share it with novice developers</a> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/21c/3ae/206/21c3ae2069d3e0c6213c21910aebbbb0.jpg"><br><br>  After analyzing the situation in different segments of the Apple App Store market, we decided to finally focus on the development of children's educational applications.  This choice meant that the new face of the company should have become close and understandable to children, especially to preschool children, who are our target audience. <br><br>  The name Little Beetle did not come immediately, it was chosen from a variety of options.  Sympathy to the <i>"Little Bug",</i> we penetrated immediately, as we imagined a cute and charming character who would perfectly play the role of the character of the children's brand.  Other options, such as AppyKids, for example, were not associated with anything specific. <br><br>  The very name Little Beetle sounds very harmonious due to the fact that both words in it rhyme with each other.  Baby names should be easy to remember first.  And children's logos should be just as pleasant and interesting. <br><br>  The visual <i>"birth" of the</i> Little Beetle bug went through several important stages.  Here is an example of a schematic representation of a bug that might appeal to adults, but not children. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/62a/e40/07b/62ae4007b0dbcb75d6a48ac0e7f23aad.jpg"><br><br>  Gradually, the bug gained human traits.  A whole series of characters was created, from which favorites were already chosen. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/4ff/da0/053/4ffda005306802876a81c73cfce4b00c.jpg"><br><br>  The preference was given to the bug in the cap of the pilot.  As you can see, on this version of the logo there were significant problems with the readability of the inscription. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/408/436/f12/408436f121849c085ed41198b0e77a0e.jpg"><br><br>  And here it is, the <b>final version of our logo</b> .  Bug added with some details, it became even more alive.  The font was chosen simple and easy to read. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/bfe/0b9/af9/bfe0b9af947cb6b9d34f31b23b07dea1.jpg"><br><br>  This is how the Littler Beetle bug looks in <i>various poses</i> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/1b1/299/d69/1b1299d6964cb8fe0e2ad8d00a3ba507.jpg"><br><br>  Beetle can dress up for different holidays.  For example, we celebrate the birthday of the company. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/9b9/50c/e3a/9b950ce3a186eb18fa887fc9651cdbaf.jpg"><br><br>  Logo can be <i>animated</i> ... <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/8c9/271/028/8c9271028d65d6c8153875e7c7741246.gif"><br><br>  ... and <i>create a video screensaver</i> with his participation, which you can see immediately after opening any of our applications. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/O7cqMCK0TQY%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,1500004,15700021,15700186,15700190,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhgArt8gA3usM4kU2Br7VrFRtMEoCw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  Coming up with the name and logo for the children's brand, we advise you to stay on this option, which can be <b>embodied in the form of a character</b> .  Children do not need impersonal abstractions, they are much nicer to look at the "living" being.  In addition, the character can be used as a hero of subsequent applications, with it you can create a cartoon, compose a fairy tale about him, and even make it a reality in the form of a soft toy.  The lively character also looks great on almost any office supplies. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/de2/676/7a5/de26767a5cb2ee50285f98e0963a275e.jpg"><br><br>  In addition to the new name and logo, the rebranding brought to our company the need to streamline our applications and icons for them.  For all the icons, we have developed a design in the same style.  This is very important if you have multiple applications. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/66f/a8f/075/66fa8f07591dbde8ea0b70b14e006d0f.jpg"><br><br>  The attentive reader can see that the Gnome Genius, whom you see on the Little Genius app, is actually the ‚Äúbrother‚Äù of the Little Beetle beetle.  These characters have a lot in common and in fact the same basis.  But this is a completely different story. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/167661/">https://habr.com/ru/post/167661/</a></p>
