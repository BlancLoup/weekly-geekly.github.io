      For reasons of my own safety and an acute reluctance to communicate with the security forces of our state, I will not post any ‚Äúsnapshots‚Äù, interfaces and detailed descriptions of the software complex controlling the installation. <br>  Well, observing the copyrights - the installation has been developed and is still improving by the D. f.  n., chief scientific.  sotr.  INP SORAN, Baru (accent on y) Semen Efimovich. <br><br>  So, let's begin. <br><br>  I think many people know such a place as the <a href="http://www.inp.nsk.su/">Novosibirsk Institute of Nuclear Physics named after G.I. Budker SORAN</a> <br>  It is there, for more than 20 years, that X-ray detectors have been developed and improved, which are then used in various systems. <br>  In our case - in the installation of contactless personal inspection SibSkan (tm, s, etc., etc.). <br><br><img src="http://hardbroker.ru/img/producs/1234180611_2392_big.jpg" alt="Sibscan"><br><br>  SibScan is a low-dose digital X-ray scanner. <br><br>  The principle of its operation can be clearly understood from the following picture. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/880/024/39a/88002439aed0b094b3cc26f46282cdce.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The emitter is an X-ray tube, similar to that used in medicine, on modern fluorography (I am not talking about film remnants of the past). <br><br>  The collimator acts as a filter.  He cuts a flat fan-shaped X-ray beam. <br>  (does not focus everything, namely it rejects the excess from the whole solid angle of the beam). <br><br>  The detector is an ionization chamber, which registers past quanta. <br><br>  During the survey, the emitter, collimator and detector move uniformly and synchronously along the supports, sending the line to the control computer every 2.5ms. <br><br>  The resulting image is 768 * 2000 * 4 bytes per pixel, processed on the computer. <br><br>  Thanks to the use of penetrating radiation, nothing is hidden from this installation) <br>  Even if a person makes an implant for himself, swallows something, puts something in the <s>ass</s> in the body's natural cavities - everything can be seen on the processed image. <br><br>  In the plot of "Vesti", people say that such a search is harmful and sranivayu it with fluorography.  But this is all from illiteracy. <br>  At Fluorographic examination there are completely different dignity.  norms.  And there a person can be irradiated hundreds of times stronger, because it requires extreme detail and a very large dynamic range.  It is because of the high dose that fluorography is done only once a year, not every month, or week. <br><br>  For the means of personal screening, there are completely different rules.  Here, the dose should be very small, so that even under the condition of passing the inspection every day it would not affect the person.  Therefore, the current and voltage on the radiator in SibScan below.  In addition, the detector specially developed at the INP has a very high sensitivity, which makes it possible to reduce the dose even more.  The collimator also reduces the dose, since it cuts off the beam, which will not be registered. <br>  Over the past 50 years, the effect of X-ray on humans has been well studied, and taking into account these developments, radiation standards have been established. <br><br>  But these are all words, many will want numbers, so: <br>  1 inspection with the help of the system SibScan - 0.5 micron (micro <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2597%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580%25D1%2582_%2528%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D1%2586%25D0%25B0_%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B7%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D1%258F%2529">Sievert</a> ) <br>  a one-way flight from Malaga to London - 10 ŒºSv, <br>  from New York to London - 35 mSv <br>  from Hong Kong to London - 50 ŒºSv <br><br>  According to the Decree of the Chief State Sanitary Doctor No. 11 of April 21, 2006 ‚ÄúOn limiting exposure of the public when conducting radiological radiological examinations‚Äù section 3.2.  It is necessary to ‚Äúensure compliance with the annual effective dose of 1 mSv when conducting prophylactic medical x-ray examinations, including during clinical examination.‚Äù <br><br>  Those.  2000 inspections can be painlessly per year. <br><br>  Let's be honest and subtract the background radiation, 1 fluorescence, flights and in the end we will get no less than 200. <br>  And many of you fly every 3 days by plane across the ocean? <br><br>  I hope this little note has brought some clarity to the principles of the SibSkan. <br><br>  <b>Update:</b> <br>  By popular demand, the main advantages over the American installation. <br>  1. We use penetrating radiation.  Which allows you to see objects not only on the surface of the human body, but also inside. <br>  In the American "mass" inspection facilities, radio waves are used.  They simply ‚Äúfeel‚Äù the person.  Consider that a person swallowed, or attached to the hair - they can not. <br><br>  2. Inspection in the SibSkan is more convenient for passengers.  During the inspection is not required to slip out, take off outerwear, lay out something from the pockets. <br><br>  But these are advantages over SafeScout and Secure 1000 systems. <br><br>  And in comparison with other scanning installations, in the SibScan, due to the use of the sensor developed in the INP, the radiation dose is several times smaller and the spatial resolution is several times higher.  (square millimeters) <br><br>  (In American locators - it is generally ~ 1cm ^ 2) <br><br>  ps I did not expect such a heated discussion and interest in the topic =) <br>  I will try in the near future to write a more detailed, more scientific article.  And also make a small comparison of "our" and "their" installations. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/80829/">https://habr.com/ru/post/80829/</a></p>
