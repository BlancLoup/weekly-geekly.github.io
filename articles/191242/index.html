A good topic raised. <br><br>  I will share my experience.  Below are identical contents of both the first and the final lecture in the trainee training program. <br><br>  In programming, in addition to computers, methods and software from different angles, there is also such a key element as a programmer.

      Why is he the most important?  Because, as many know, most of the solutions can be created without a computer, without methods and without software - with a pencil on paper or even in imagination.  And without a programmer you cannot create a program.  Because he, the programmer, just creates the program. <br><br>  We will now talk about the programmer, as a decisive factor, and about his brain, as a basic tool. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h1>  Rational use of resources </h1><br>  The machine operator familiarizes himself with the design of the machine before starting work.  A motorist studies the structure of a car, its mechanics and physics, at least at a basic level.  A seamstress is studying a sewing machine.  Many artists are almost familiar with the behavior of the pile on different types of brushes in different conditions, with different pressure and touch angle ... <br><br>  To create computer programs, the programmer, among other things, uses the / dev / brain device, also known in the world as the brain. <br><br>  In addition to the analytical part, the principles of which are still unknown and doubtful, the main functional parts of / dev / brain are the channels of perception and memory.  Including ‚Äúmemory‚Äù, which can be associated with thinking. <br><br>  It so happened that the channels of perception correspond to the sections of memory, and have some related properties.  Using one or another channel of perception - the corresponding type of memory is activated. <br><br><h1>  Perception channels </h1><br>  Kinesthetic perception is what can be felt.  <i>As before, the best way to transfer information between generations is to hit the head.</i> <br><br>  Visual perception is what you can see.  <i>Demonstration of the naked female breast often works as a decisive factor in making life-determining decisions.</i> <br><br>  Audio perception is what can be heard.  Lack of noise, music, words of colleagues, discussion, yelling at someone or listening to someone's cries are all from here. <br><br><h1>  Memory zones </h1><br><h5>  Kinesthetic memory </h5><br>  The strongest.  <i>In the childhood of the future physiologist Pavlov was bitten by a dog.</i>  <i>The dog bit and forgot.</i>  <i>But Pavlov grew up and did not forget ...</i> <br>  I do not know how to characterize the volume.  The access speed is the highest, this mechanism is very close to instincts and reflexes. <br><br><h5>  Visual memory </h5><br>  It has the largest volume.  Access speed is probably lower than average.  However, as will be shown below, it has a huge scope for application, and is the most effective. <br><br>  A simple test to understand this well.  You can remember the faces of almost every person you have ever met in your life.  Imagine how much information this is?  And remembering will take 1-2 seconds. <br><br>  For solving programming problems, they are quite acceptable, and even excellent parameters. <br><br><h5>  Audio memory </h5><br>  And here different people have different ways.  Someone she is well developed, but someone is not developed at all.  But all useful.  How - show below. <br><br><h5>  Abstract memory </h5><br>  Abstract perception does not correspond to any of the channels of perception.  In order to present something abstract, you need to strain your brain very, very strongly. <br><br>  It has the smallest volume!  A person is able to simultaneously hold in his head from 3 to 7 abstract facts.  If his name is not Wasserman - at the moment when he tries to take into account the eighth factor in the system being analyzed - one of the previously updated ones will disappear from the field of logical visibility. <br><br>  And all this can and should be taken into account. <br><br><h1>  Yuzkeysy </h1><br>  We show how the channels of perception work in various cases from the work of the programmer. <br><br><h5>  To blunt the monitor </h5><br>  The most frequent and lowest productivity case.  The programmer is sitting and tupit in the monitor.  Reads texts in different languages, searches for something, tries to solve something.  At the same time, the main resource used is abstract thinking.  The most expensive, expensive and low-productivity.  Therefore, the products are, indeed, brilliant, but they come with huge time and energy costs.  This is the most inefficient of all cases. <br><br>  How to get rid of the problem of stupor in the monitor? <br><br>  Very simple.  It is enough to place the clock in the field of view, and every 20 minutes you must leave the workplace for 10 minutes.  A good idea is to take this time with physical activities or socializing. <br><br>  Not the best, although popular solutions - to smoke or watch TV.  Harmful to health, but also helps. <br><br><h5>  Draw a picture </h5><br>  Using the possibilities of visual perception and visual memory, it is possible to make decisions and analyze multi-component systems.  Even if the number of elements in the system exceeds seven, it will not be difficult to work with a visual representation of this system as a diagram. <br><br>  There are academic tricks to use this technique.  First, it is a wonderful UML.  Secondly, these are the XP (Extreme Programming) and SCRUM methods.  The effectiveness of these methods is undeniable. <br><br>  About XP, you can read on Wikipedia, and about UML I will note immediately some of its remarkable properties: <br><ul><li>  Easily allows you to manage the levels of abstraction and control the detail in the development of any kind of solutions when programming.  In practice, this is the only method for really effective solution of decomposition problems (‚ÄúDivide and conquer!‚Äù). </li><li>  The only effective method for the reliable transfer of abstract information between colleagues.  Everyone will understand exactly what the author of the scheme intended when they see it with their own eyes.  Surprisingly, when the content of the scheme is transmitted on the fingers - by text or by ear, the quality of perception is significantly reduced!  People just do not understand each other, or do not understand at all that and not as it was intended. </li><li>  UML in particular, and visual techniques in general, is a well-known method of management, when it is necessary to quickly and reliably transfer information between colleagues of various qualifications, various specialties, and receive feedbacks, organize communication and exchange of opinions. </li><li>  UML in particular, and other visual methods - one of the most effective methods for the transmission of advertising messages. </li><li>  UML is very cheap - you can easily and quickly draw a diagram with pencils, felt-tip pens or in a vector graphics editor.  Effectively replaces many hours of stupor in the monitor, actually reducing the amount of time and energy spent on solving logical problems. </li></ul><br><br>  In general, visual methods are the most effective for learning.  Remember high school girls from high school?  (Beware, now there will be a kind of humor - sarcasm) Most of them are fools ... But nothing prevents them from systematically getting fives.  If you looked in their notebooks - the information is always well structured, and is represented by COLOR graphics.  Therefore, they remember the material very well and easily use it even for abstract conclusions. <br><br>  <b>Smart do not bother.</b>  <b>They outline and draw.</b> <br><br>  It is easy to improve the quality of illustrations - it is enough to work out color codes (apply colors, and do it meaningfully and systematically) and solve the decomposition problems at this stage.  Do not allow visually complex schemes - divide them into fragments and <b>allocate more levels, if necessary</b> . <br><br>  It is also easy to reduce the quality of illustrations - all you need to do is to draw everything in one color and (or) make complex schemes.  So that they are perceived slowly and with difficulty. <br><br><h5>  Discuss with colleagues </h5><br>  Some of the most ingenious solutions come during the discussion.  Therefore, discussions are so helpful, even if not all the participants in the discussion are competent.  Remember the rubber duck method. <br><br>  What happens with this? <br><br>  Before the discussion, a visual and (or) abstract presentation of the problem is already present in the minds of the participants (or at least one key participant). <br><br>  The discussion, however, is like another perceptual channel involving audio memory, regardless of how much the audio presentation is pumped from specific participants - it creates a <b>three-dimensional representation of the</b> subject!  Therefore, it is during the discussion that even more brilliant thoughts are born than with an exceptionally abstract analysis of the tasks, when drowning at the monitor. <br><br>  Vivid examples, many of the readers have met hundreds of times in smoking rooms and at meetings with talented managers. <br><br>  We organize internal seminars several times a week.  Each of the colleagues shares with the other colleagues their current tasks and the tried ways of solving them.  While talking - come to mind the brightest ideas. <br><br>  There are a lot of ideas.  They are brilliant and their price is low - usually from half to ten brilliant decisions are born in half an hour of conversation. <br><br>  From TRIZ.  Japanese engineers at internal seminars (planning meetings, brainstorming sessions are not the essence) use an interesting method.  Initially, all participants express as stupid, wild and crazy ideas as possible.  As a result, forgive me for terminology, a critical expansion of an incomplete gestalt, which leads to an instantaneous expansion of mentality and the acquisition of new views of perception.  Thus, they give rise to truly ingenious, effective solutions. <br><br>  Happiness will come if you once again go through the article and google the terms.  Select the word, then right-click and select ‚ÄúSearch for ...‚Äù in the menu that opens. <br><br>  Thank you for your attention and good luck to all! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/191242/">https://habr.com/ru/post/191242/</a></p>
