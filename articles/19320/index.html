  <section class="page js-page"><h1>As I transplanted to the Mac. Part 1.</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  I am writing this article at the request of my friends.  This article is for those who are thinking about buying a Mac and about the possible consequences of such a transition.  Everything that is written further, exclusively IMHO.  If you don‚Äôt like Apple, you‚Äôre not interested in it - please don‚Äôt read.  I do not want to incite holivar, so I publish an article on my personal blog.  If it is interesting, then I will post it to the Apple blog.  Also, I don‚Äôt want people to say: ‚ÄúWell, why everyone who has been transferred to some new platform simply considers it a duty to write an article about it‚Äù?  If people are interested, then such a need still exists, and not all is written on this topic.  I want to convey my impressions of the transition to the Mac OS X platform, especially since I have very fresh ones.  New MacBook use only 3 weeks.  I hope that this will not be another enthusiastic article of the Apple fan, I really want to talk about everything more or less objectively.  Any criticism, questions, suggestions, comments and advice are welcome. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h1>  HOW IT ALL BEGAN </h1><br>  I wanted to start to talk about the reasons for the transition.  Everything is very simple and trivial - tired of the endless wars against viruses.  Over the past six months, the system was reinstalled regularly once a month - one and a half.  Something stopped working as always at the wrong time.  Then came Vista, and just scared me.  I usually try to be among the first to try all sorts of computer innovations, to keep track of new versions so that the transition is consistent.  I didn't want to go to Vista at all.  I began to look for alternatives to Windows.  It turned out that there are two alternatives: either Unix / Linux &amp; co, or Mac OS.  Let me say at once why I did not choose Linux.  I am a simple regular user.  Difficult childhood with Windows 95, then Millenium and XP taught to reinstall the system, all the necessary programs, clean the registry a bit, etc.  After everything I read about Linux, it seemed that this system was for supermen who have such knowledge that I never dreamed of.  In addition, the compatibility issue was acute for me.  Plus, such messages as it was not possible to find drivers for such a device, how difficult it is to set up the Internet, etc.  cheerfulness is not inspired.  It‚Äôs clear that there are a lot of people who understand and understand all this, but I‚Äôm clearly not one of them.  In addition, there were no Linux gurus nearby who could be overwhelmed with questions like: ‚ÄúOh, why can't I do this, or else it doesn't work‚Äù?  In general, I didn‚Äôt have a relationship with Linux / Unix. <br><br>  Once, when computer problems started again, I remembered the wonderful and cute computers I used to work on while studying in America.  Everything was simple and clear in them, I remembered that I had sat down for the first time and did not even feel that there was a completely different operating system.  Somehow all by itself turned out, the work went along, etc.  But one thing is there sometimes in Photoshop to work, to look for something in Netscape Navigator, when someone else is working on the computer, and another thing is to work with it constantly, install the necessary programs, ensure everything for a comfortable existence.  I became interested in this issue in more detail.  Is it possible to buy them from us?  And where are they sold?  And how much are?  Why so much?  Will there be compatibility problems?  Where to get the program?  In the process of researching these questions, the old and proven method of googling hit Habr, and so it remained here :) In general, I will tell everything in order.

    <h1>  CAN YOU BUY THEM WITH US?  And where are they for sale? </h1><br>  It should be noted that I live in Zaporizhia.  In central cities this is easier.  Especially good - in the central cities of America :) In Kiev, Moscow and St. Petersburg is also not bad (at least, judging by the number of addresses / sites of stores found on the Internet).  In the regions harder.  So, in the framework of the quest called ‚Äúwhere you can buy a Mac in Zaporozhye‚Äù I went shopping.  It turned out that immediately - nowhere.  In some stores they are not engaged in this, in others it is necessary to place an order, and it is possible - if you are lucky - and something will be available, they will be brought from Kiev or Kharkov.  In most stores they looked at me as if I asked a live dinosaur in a pet store, or shook my head with understanding and thought: ‚ÄúThis is another blonde thing that went for an ad and wants Apple for ponta‚Äù.  They said, let us order you Asus, even though it is white, at least pink, even in a leather case.  I wanted to ask, why do you think that I choose a computer in appearance, eh?  But she did not dare.  Do not break stereotypes, and then people in the middle of the working day will still have disk defragmentation :))) <br><br>  Quest results: Poppy can be ordered, it will be brought, take some money for delivery.  Recently a couple of Macs appeared in the central department store, but I didn‚Äôt inspire confidence in the professionalism of the workers.  At that time I was already a bit in the subject, after reading all kinds of forums and blogs, and local sellers, as it turned out, did not understand at all.  I'm new, I'm going to switch to a new system, and you sell a product, you should know everything about it!  And if the question arises? <br><br>  So as not to tell for a long time, I will run ahead and tell you how it all ended for me.  I went and thought about three months.  During this time, I found a million arguments both for and against.  In the end, I got everyone around me so that they said, please buy it and don‚Äôt suffer (yeah, suffer with it :))) As a result, ‚Äúfor‚Äù outweighed ‚Äúagainst‚Äù for the New Year, and then we wanted everything urgently.  It was not at all embarrassing that Macy had already almost all bought up, that the shops were leaving for the New Year holidays, that there were no tickets, that the frosts were cold.  January 4, I went to the Poppy for Kiev.  Theoretically, it could be ordered, and it would have been brought.  But I just wanted to see.  I started having problems with my eyes, and I was very worried about the screen.  Chose between 20 'iMac and 13' MacBook.  Another option was considered 15 'MacBook Pro.  I do not process the graphics yet, I don‚Äôt work with the video, I don‚Äôt do anything particularly ‚Äúheavy‚Äù, so I decided that it would be enough for my user needs and something simpler and cheaper.  Very afraid that 13 inches will be small.  When I arrived at the store, I looked at everything on the spot, I realized that without a white macbook I would not go anywhere.  Oh, my favorite color, my favorite size - what are you doing with me!  The 13-inch screen is not much and not enough, but exactly as much as I need.  I decided that if necessary, I will buy a Cinema display for it and in general I will live happily ever after. <br><br>  The seller showed me everything, told and explained.  Registration is required at the start of the first run.  I was very surprised - I didn‚Äôt see anything like this in Windows.  Then they explained to me that this is for the benefit of the users themselves.  Each computer has a unique number, and information about who the computer is sold to is sent to Apple, and if something happens to the computer (for example, you lose it somewhere or someone steals it), you can find it when you access the Internet.  Something like this.  I'm not sure that in our country they will be able to find at least something, but it sounded very encouraging.  For a long time I tried to enter my data in Russian and thought how could I change the layout.  It turned out - yet nothing.  I filled out several forms in English.  There it was necessary to enter information there rather standard - a name, a surname, the electronic and postal address, in what sphere the Mac will be used.  I wrote that I was Student, and then I understood why they ask it.  They now send me an e-mail advertisement with embedded pictures, still offer to buy a .Mac package, and in promotional letters, pictures with students.  Would write something like Administration or Management, business uncles and aunts, probably, would be :) <br><br>  I also thought about where in Kiev I could find a wi-fi cafe to download all sorts of updates and programs for Mac.  It turned out that no need to go anywhere, and the wi-fi cafe will be here.  We quickly downloaded updates to it, chatted with the seller about this, I asked to show me where the system settings and in particular the Internet settings are.  In general, I was shown and told everything, we also talked about the iPhone, I was solemnly assured that once and immediately.  In between, I was showered with tea.  In general, the purchase was quite fun and interesting, and the store itself seemed to me a wonderful place, because I had never seen so many wonderful computers at once.  I even wanted to work there :) The manager was very kind and helpful, he understood the subject.  In short, made us a very pleasant impression.  I will not deal with free advertising, especially since people from different countries have gathered here, and if it will be interesting to someone, write messages and tell you more about the stores in Kiev and their pricing policies. <br><br><h1>  And how much do they cost? </h1><br>  Usually, prices posted on the sites of shops.  Prices are more or less the same, but there is a difference.  I chose my place of purchase according to the following criteria: the most pleasant prices, an excellent and thoughtful website, to which I became very attached during long thoughts, impressions after a telephone conversation with the manager about: ‚ÄúI want a computer now and how can we do it‚Äù?  Another reason why I went to Kiev was the difference in price.  Everything that could be bought from us cost $ 200 dollars more.  Again, for residents of the center cities this is not relevant, and usually there is free delivery around the city.  I decided that for this money it is possible to go to Kiev (a ticket will cost a maximum of $ 40), and the difference is to get all the necessary and pleasant trifles for yourself, such as: Aiport Express (wi-fi point), case, and iWork'08 ( a set of office programs for Mac). <br><br><h1>  WHY SO MUCH? </h1><br>  This question did not give me rest for a long time.  Still, for the implementation of the plan, significant investments were required, which were somewhat disproportionate to the student‚Äôs salary.  Special thanks to parents for their support in this matter :) I really wanted the computer to not disappoint, otherwise it would be very sad.  Written about this a lot, and this is the eternal theme for holivar.  It‚Äôs very hard for ideological opponents to explain why a computer costs such money.  Supporters and fans will tell you that poppy is more than hardware, it is also Mac OS.  Plus, there is already initially a set of useful programs for work (there are so many of them there that I haven‚Äôt figured out everyone else).  The most basic is iLife plus other native Mac apps.  About the price I can say the following: when in one of the large stores I asked for the price of a MacBookPro (15 'and 17'), and then for Asus with similar parameters (I will not list all those specifications now), the prices gave me the same order (about $ 3000), and about the prices I calmed down.  Yes, you can take a computer for $ 400 dollars, ‚Äúbut this is not our way‚Äù.  I took a macbook and have no regrets - it is worth every cent spent.  Only joy and pleasure from work is worth something.  Today again I ran into problems at work, where XP stands.  ‚ÄúI'm doing everything right.  Why doesn't it work? ‚ÄùOr‚Äú What kind of idiot is here again?  To block their access to the I-no tightly! ‚ÄùIs very annoying and sometimes puts into a stupor when you fight, fight with this computer, but it refuses to do what you need, in general, the desire to work disappears: (Again, perhaps, some there are no such problems, but I give personal impressions here and I think that many people know firsthand what I am talking about. Let's just say that the problem with viruses at my office was solved simply. I tried many antiviruses and solved the problem radically - I bought Mac Now I am not at all interested in how  oh idiot again brought viruses to the flash drive. For the most part, I work at home on a Mac, and EVERYTHING IS EQUALLY for me. Great feeling - believe me :) <br><br>  Something the article is delayed, and tell a lot more.  I think tomorrow I will write a sequel, where I will describe the impressions about working with programs, all sorts of pleasant and not-so-good moments.  Anyone who is going to move to Macs can advise the following: make a list of programs that you are using now and look for alternatives / substitutes on Macs.  See what is critical for you and what is not.  In the next article I will write about this in more detail, how it all happened to me.  And this article can be considered introductory.  I apologize for "multibuckoff", but in short it did not work out. <br><br>  UPD: On the advice of friends, she moved to the Apple blog. <br>  UPD1: Wrote a <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blog/apple/34765.html">sequel</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/19320/">https://habr.com/ru/post/19320/</a></p>
