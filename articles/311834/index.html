CompTIA CTT + (Certified Technical Trainer)</a> </blockquote><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/4a5/ac3/a85/4a5ac3a8561646b196b49c7e4e564571.jpg"></div><br><h3>  1. ‚ÄúWhat is a Cloud?‚Äù </h3><br>  In response to this question, various options for renting infrastructure (Infrastructure-), platform (Platform-), or applications (Software-) as services (asService) from a public (Public) or private (Private) provider (Provider), which they managed to collide.  It is extremely rare to partially reproduce the convoluted definition of the term Cloud Computing, given by the US National Institute of Standardization and Technology (NIST) in the <a href="http://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/Legacy/SP/nistspecialpublication800-145.pdf">SP800-145</a> publication <a href="http://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/Legacy/SP/nistspecialpublication800-145.pdf">series</a> , namely: <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  For example, it is possible to make it easy for you to travel. or service provider interaction.  ‚ÄúThree service models, and four deployment models.‚Äù <br><br>  And the answers often end there, and it‚Äôs a pity, because misunderstanding of the essence of the cloud model of IT services consumption doesn‚Äôt give these people a chance to become the head of the IT department, the AIS architect, or at least the design engineer demanded by the leading companies in the world. <br><br>  To eliminate this annoying lack of education, imagine the machine part of the AIS in the form of a robot assistant that provides services for storing, transferring and processing information resources to company employees who implement the business processes that form the so-called economic business model in accordance with organizational and administrative documentation.  Ideally, to create this robot (in the form of aggregate, equipment, communication channels, system and application software, design and operational documentation, etc.) usually take a description of the economic model of the business and project it onto the terms of reference (hereinafter TK) to create it as products that can be produced on an industrial scale - this work is usually performed by a person.  But there is a problem, the economic model of the business changes over time for various reasons: whether it is a change in market conditions or the need to absorb another company or a myriad of other reasons - in any case, the assistant robot becomes outdated and there is a need to modify it, and in many cases even get rid of operation and replace it with a completely different one - in general, and this process had to be carried out for a long time by a person - it is expensive for a long time and often to no avail. 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"

          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      And now attention - imagine that the company once went from writing TK to commissioning a unique product - a universal robot designer (let's call it Cloud).  This Cloud needs to be monitored and maintained in a healthy state and this requires qualified personnel.  But the most interesting thing is that this Cloud offers the services of assembling robotic assistants (remember that this is AIS) according to the specification that employees of business units unqualified neither in IT nor especially in IB can be set through a certain Self-service portal in the language they understand, using the parts catalog (Service catalog).  The cloud will collect the AIS from the set of spare parts \ consumables (Resource pool), make sure that it works and give it to operation to the ordered business division, keeping strict records of how many and what spare parts and consumables were spent on assembly and spent during operation.  In a sense, the AIS is indeed leased to the business unit.  If necessary, modify the AIS for new goals / tasks, the cycle repeats, and when the lease ends, the AIS returns to the Cloud, and it is disassembled into parts, which in turn return to the set. <br><br>  In other words, robots make robots!  This is the essence of the cloud model of IT services consumption, but among the many advantages of its implementation, there are minimization of expenses and operational adaptation of the business to changing economic conditions, etc., etc. That is why leading companies and states of the planet are en masse. <br><br><h3>  2. Familiarity with certification </h3><br>  <a href="https://certification.comptia.org/certifications/cloud">CompTIA Cloud +</a> certification is designed to test understanding of the essence of the cloud model of IT services consumption, as well as basic knowledge and skills in the implementation of the reference cloud model developed by the National Institute of Standardization and Technology (NIST) of the USA.  Certification is designed for a wide audience, including all specialists in IT / IB. <br>  To obtain status, it is enough to pass the exam with code CV0-001 (for 2016) as a computer test in a controlled environment of the VUE testing center.  The exam consists of 100 questions in English that must be answered within 90 minutes (+30 minutes if you pass the exam in a non-English speaking country).  Questions are presented in <a href="https://certification.comptia.org/training/sample-questions/cloud-practice-questions">Multiple-choice</a> format and test your knowledge and skills in <a href="https://certification.comptia.org/docs/default-source/exam-objectives/comptia_cloud_objectives_cv0-001.pdf">9 domains</a> , namely: <br><br><blockquote>  1.0 Cloud Concepts and Models 12% <br>  2.0 Virtualization 19% <br>  3.0 Infrastructure 21% <br>  4.0 Resource Management 13% <br>  5.0 Security 16% <br>  6.0 Systems Management 11% <br>  7.0 Business Continuity in the Cloud 8% </blockquote><br><h3>  3. Method of preparation </h3><br>  As an alternative to expensive full-time study, <a href="https://www.nist.gov/itl/cloud-computing">NIST</a> self-study, <a href="https://www.nist.gov/itl/cloud-computing">publications</a> officially recommended by the operator of the <a href="https://certification.comptia.org/training/self-study%3Fcert%3DCloud%252B%26mtype%3DSS_BOOKS">self-instruction manual</a> certification, as well as numerous online training courses for the certification of Cloud + will be fine.  Among the suitable ones, it is worth highlighting the free online course <a href="https://educast.emc.com/learn/explore-the-modern-data-center-self-paced%3Futm_source%3Dglobal%26utm_medium%3Dbanner_ext%26utm_campaign%3Dmdc_mooc_launch">Explore the Modern Data Center</a> , which clearly reveals the role of virtualization technologies and hyperconverted components in creating a software-defined data center (consider most of the Cloud).  Other materials can be easily found on such portals as certcollection.org or techexams.net. <br><br>  A wide list of topics tested at the exam unambiguously presupposes the existence of practical experience in administering a heterogeneous network in the scope of Network + certification, an understanding of computing virtualization technologies (Type 1, Type 2 hypervisors), networks (VLAN, VxLAN), and storage (VSAN, vSAN), as well as the basics information security in the scope of certification <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/muk/blog/253353/">Security +</a> . <br><br><h3>  4. Result </h3><br>  After passing the exam, certification status is given for 3 years and within the framework of the concept of lifelong learning ( <a href="https://certification.comptia.org/continuing-education">Continuous Education</a> ) requires annual membership fees and reporting in the personal account of the certification operator confirming that you maintain your qualifications up to date. <br><br>  The most interesting thing is that passing an exam, you just confirmed the understanding of the reference cloud model of NIST.  The next step will be to study the methodology for designing cloud-based automated systems, the knowledge and experience of which are vital for working as a design engineer and / or technical writer. <br><br>  If you are interested in the work of the architect of cloud systems, then you need to learn how to describe economic business models in the form of business processes, write feasibility studies on the costs of automation and organize the work of a team of design engineers to create a cloud-based automated system as a product . <br><br>  In any case, it‚Äôs time for you to study full-time <a href="http://muk.training/courses/emc/6992/">at the authorized courses mentioned earlier</a> . <br><br>  Send questions about training and certification CompTIA by <a href="">mail</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/311834/">https://habr.com/ru/post/311834/</a></p>
