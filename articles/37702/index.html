  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Top Startups 2008</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"> A brief overview of the main startups Runet for 2008 (those who started this year).  All sites are divided into 2 groups: in the first there are ‚Äúheavyweights‚Äù - big services, portals, social networks, in which often considerable budgets are invested;  the second group - ‚Äúdandelions‚Äù - small projects implemented by enthusiasts or small companies. <br><br>  <b>"Heavyweights":</b> <br><br>  <a href="http://moskva.ru/">moskva.ru</a> - <b>Moskva.ru</b> <br>  Social network.  There is everything you need to have a progressive social network, from groups to video uploads.  Started very recently - July 1. <br>  <b>Prospects:</b> It can become a social network number 3 after Odnoklassniki and Vkontakte.  The project is engaged very seriously.  This is spoken of as a domain (apparently, it‚Äôs not bought for one hundred thousand dollars), a list of services by the time of launch, a strong team of developers. <br>  I think we can safely assume that there is some serious investor behind Moscow.  With proper advertising policy, the site can become a social network number 3 in Russia.  On the other hand, although the developers say that Moscow.Ru is a project not only for the residents of the capital, but the domain may alienate users from the regions.

    <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  <a href="http://life.ru/">life.ru</a> - <b>L! fe</b> <br>  The project of the newspaper Life.  Launched the project in April, is already included in the 20 most popular sites on the Runet.  Yellow news. <br>  <b>Prospects:</b> good chances to become the main Internet runo table. <br><br>  <a href="http://gdeetotdom.ru/">gdeetotdom.ru</a> - <b>Where is this dom.Ru</b> <br>  Portal about real estate, the main feature of which is the ability to see photos of all real estate and its surroundings.  Photos are taken by specially equipped cars plying the streets of the city. <br>  <b>Prospects:</b> Excellent, if you look at the American equivalent.  On our Internet market, things can be more complicated.  But the project is really interesting and original for Runet.  Thanks to the authors. <br><br>  <a href="http://dribbler.ru/">dribbler.ru</a> <b>Dribbler</b> <br>  Football social network from developers HabraHabr.  The site was launched before the start of the 2008 European Championship, but so far has not gained much popularity.  The part of users there was attracted in the first days from Habr, and then the flow of visitors began to plummet.  Now on Dribbler 2-3 new users are registered per day. <br>  <b>Prospects:</b> foggy.  Immediately, the project did not go, that the owners will take to popularize it is still unclear.  Until now, Dribbler advertising, except on habr.ru was not observed. <br><br>  <a href="http://drive2.ru/">drive2.ru</a> - <b>Drive 2.0</b> <br>  Social network from the Internet magazine Drive.ru.  The ability to tell and show your car.  The project is implemented at a high technical level, but so far there is a shortage of services.  Just wander and evaluate other people's cars quickly tires. <br>  <b>Prospects:</b> The project will not achieve wide popularity and will most likely remain as an entertainment supplement to the main drive.ru resource. <br><br>  <a href="http://www.piter.fm/">www.piter.fm</a> <b>Peter.FM</b> <br>  All radio stations Petersburg.  You can listen to songs from the air, create your own playlist, find the song that sounded on the air earlier at a given time <br>  Website functionality, as I understand Moskva.fm clone.  Both projects are executed immaculately high quality. <br>  <b>Prospects:</b> popularity among residents of St. Petersburg and not only. <br><br>  <a href="http://livehh.ru/">livehh.ru</a> - <b>Headhunter Live</b> <br>  Business-oriented social network: corporate blogs, professional communities.  Another project of the company HeadHunter. <br>  <b>Prospects:</b> There is a chance for success among office workers.  Given the size of the audience of friendly resources hh.ru and webby.ru, some of them can go to this service. <br><br>  <a href="http://top4top.ru/">top4top.ru</a> - <b>Top4Top</b> <br>  Pseudo-intelligent portal.  The main failure of the year.  Neither the names of the project's masterminds (Dibrov and Novozhenov), nor the $ 15 million allocated by investors for advertising and development, helped. <br>  Made on flash, at the time of launch, the site had a lot of small and large flaws, for which bloggers simply pecked it.  After that, a fat cross was put on the top4top, and the majority of users did not return there again. <br>  <b>Prospects:</b> in this form there. <br><br>  <a href="http://vshtate.ru/">vshtate.ru</a> - <b>In the state</b> <br>  Social network for employees and employers.  A new project by Pavel Durov, the creator of vkontakte.ru.  The network offers to share experiences, summaries and be always up to date with the events of its industry. <br>  Prospects: To become one of the main Internet projects of the new type for job search.  Given the audience Vkontakte project can quickly gain popularity. <br><br>  <a href="http://www.bestpersons.ru/">www.bestpersons.ru</a> - <b>The best people</b> <br>  An interesting project that combines the user's online business card, connecting all of his profiles in social networks and blog hosting sites.  It is possible to write posts to different blogs from a single interface on bestpersons.ru. <br>  <b>Perspectives:</b> Brilliant.  It can really become the service that will unite all the services used by the user;  passport user and his homepage on the Internet. <br><br>  <b>Dandelions:</b> <br><br>  <a href="http://pavlikmorozov.ru/">pavlikmorozov.ru</a> - <b>Pavlik Morozov</b> <br>  The essence of the project is to bring a potential client to the customer.  That is, ‚Äúsurrender‚Äù your friend, relative or colleague and receive remuneration for it. <br>  <b>Perspectives:</b> Doubtful.  Yet, not everything is so bad in our society to hand over friends to sellers of goods and services. <br><br>  <a href="http://www.funkyjob.ru/">www.funkyjob.ru</a> - <b>Work on FunkyJob</b> <br>  Portal about work.  The main feature of the site - service recommendations.  Recommend a friend for a job and get a reward.  Lightweight version of Pavlik Frost in headhunting. <br>  <b>Perspectives:</b> Foggy.  The service can ‚Äúshoot‚Äù just as a quality portal about work, but so far this has not happened.  Not too large job base.  Chip site in the Russian market will not work. <br><br>  <a href="http://zmap.ru/">zmap.ru</a> - <b>Interactive map for car enthusiasts</b> <br>  Using the technology of Google Maps, users are offered to put traffic police posts, road works, etc. <br>  <b>Perspectives:</b> Yes.  Given the rapid growth of the car park in our country, any competently made auto project with competent PR can count on the interest of users and advertisers. <br><br>  <a href="http://picfor.me/">picfor.me</a> - <b>online bookmark service for images</b> . <br>  Simple service to add images directly from the browser. <br>  <b>Prospects:</b> Local popularity.  The creators of the project, apparently, do not plan to advertise the project.  And the pictures are still more convenient to save to the hard disk. <br><br>  <a href="http://design911.ru/">design911.ru</a> - <b>Design 911</b> <br>  Freelance Exchange for designers. <br>  Nice design, web2.0 chips, but nothing fundamentally new. <br>  <b>Prospects:</b> foggy.  It can be another second-tier freelancers' exchange. <br><br>  <a href="http://www.oleee.ru/">www.oleee.ru</a> - <b>Football Fans Community</b> <br>  Judging by the attendance counter project failed. <br>  <b>Prospects:</b> not yet. <br><br>  <a href="http://munga.ru/">munga.ru</a> - a <b>project dedicated to coworking in the CIS</b> <br>  The site, made in the wake of the popularity of the coworking movement.  So far, the only significant resource on this subject. <br>  <b>Perspectives:</b> become the main source of information for coders.  The popularity of the resource depends largely on the prevalence of co-working centers in the CIS.  If there are many of these, the site will receive both users and advertisers. <br><br>  <a href="http://anonimster.ru/">anonimster.ru</a> - <b>Anonymous with feedback</b> <br>  Electronic anonymous letters that can be answered.  A funny idea that will help those who want to anonymously express their love or hate. <br>  <b>Prospects:</b> local popularity. <br><br>  <a href="http://infuture.ru/">infuture.ru</a> is an <b>online magazine about advanced scientific and technical achievements</b> . <br>  The future is near. <br>  <b>Prospects:</b> Popularity among the resources of its subject. <br><br>  <a href="http://bloggerland.ru/">bloggerland.ru</a> - <b>Bloggerland</b> <br>  The project is aimed at users of liveinternet.ru.  The main service is the best blog entries of the type digg.com;  other useful services for bloggers.  At the moment the site is not developing. <br>  <b>Prospects:</b> very vague. <br><br>  <a href="http://bookriver.ru/">bookriver.ru</a> - <b>Bookriver</b> <br>  Book exchange.  Site motto: change the book, save the tree. <br>  An interesting idea, only paper books read less and less, especially those who have access to the Internet. <br>  The service needs to expand towards the exchange of movies and music.  The exchange of vinyl records could cause no less interest than the exchange of books.  True, quite a small part of the audience - fans of vinyl and nastolgiuyuschiesya for the exchange of records in the Soviet era. <br>  <b>Prospects:</b> local popularity. <br><br>  <a href="http://ktotam.ru/">ktotam.ru</a> <b>Who's there.</b>  <b>Search by personnel.</b> <br>  A search engine who searches for people by name and builds connections between them.  The idea is interesting, but the implementation is still very lame. <br>  Users leave more and more traces on the network.  It would be interesting to get a service with which you can find all the information on the network about a person by name or nickname.  Both from open sources and closed social networks, such as Vkontak and Odnoklassniki. <br>  <b>Prospects:</b> Yes, when finalizing the engine. <br><br>  <a href="http://dump.ru/">dump.ru</a> - <b>Storage of files without registration</b> <br>  The service allows you to store files up to 100mb.  No registration up to 1 month.  With registration indefinitely. <br>  <b>Prospects:</b> May become popular as ifolder.ru, if there is enough server capacity and does not begin to curb the whole site with advertising. <br><br>  <a href="http://vizitka2.ru/">vizitka2.ru</a> - <b>Business card 2.0</b> <br>  Almost the same service I conceived myself 2 years ago.  On business card 2.0, you can create your virtual card and send a link to it to your friends and partners, rather than writing contacts again. <br>  However, the service is largely flawed.  E-mails are shown in the open (run, spammer, bots!), Too little information about the user. <br>  It would be much more interesting to be able to close business cards from the general view and create other people‚Äôs business cards.  Thus, you would receive a virtual business card holder, where not only my business card, but all of my partners and friends.  Add to this the ability to exchange business cards between users. <br>  <b>Prospects:</b> when finalizing the service - local popularity among IT specialists. <br><br>  <a href="http://dubbee.com/">Dubbee.com</a> - <b>Dubbee.com</b> <br>  Service to translate texts of news sites and blogs in audio format.  Some articles habr.ru can now listen. <br>  The idea is unusual, but its practical meaning is unclear to me.  We already have audiobooks, do we now also perceive the texts of the sites by ear?  So a person in general will learn to read. <br>  There is a commercial option - when a resource is ordering Dubbee to voice texts (by the way, anyone can try to become a speaker).  This is more interesting, in fact, announcers can also be used to recite advertising texts or create amateur audio books. <br>  <b>Prospects</b> :? <br><br>  <a href="http://moemesto.ru/">moemesto.ru</a> - <b>My Place</b> <br>  Combined bookmark and file storage service. <br>  <b>Prospects:</b> With considerable competition among bookmarking services, it can become a strong middle peasant. <br><br>  <a href="http://yapiligrim.ru/">yapiligrim.ru</a> - <b>I am a pilgrim</b> <br>  Social network for travelers.  Photos and videos of their own and other people's travels. <br>  <b>Prospects: The</b> popularity of the project in its niche, with proper advertising. <br><br>  <a href="http://cameraphoner.com/">cameraphoner.com</a> - <a href="http://cameraphoner.com/">Cameraphoner</a> <br>  Add photos and videos using MMS messages. <br>  Prospects: Service has the right to exist, but no tendencies to mass popularity can be traced. <br><br>  <a href="http://fmates.ru/">fmates.ru</a> <b>FeedMates</b> <br>  The program, the participation in which turns the content of your blog or site into a contextual advertising tool.  The RSS feed is added to the database and the headlines of your articles are shown on the websites and blogs of other members of the network. <br>  Very curious service.  Especially interesting to bloggers. <br>  <b>Prospects:</b> Good.  With the growth of the participant base from a simple exchange network of RSS feeds can turn into a paid advertising tool. <br><br>  <a href="http://autoblogger.ru/">autoblogger.ru</a> - <b>Autoblogger</b> <br>  Social network for car enthusiasts.  The highlight is not found.  There are not many users. <br>  <b>Prospects:</b> most likely will remain the project of the 2nd tier ... <br><br>  <a href="http://funtastic.ru/">funtastic.ru</a> - <b>Funtastic</b> <br>  Entertainment social network for office workers.  A collective blog for posting videos and funny photos.  Absolutely nothing new. <br>  <b>Prospects:</b> no. <br><br>  <a href="http://ranx.ru/">RANX.ru</a> - <b>dating site RANX</b> <br>  Acquaintance on photos, without bulky questionnaires.  You choose a partner by photo, but he is not sent a notification that you (her) gave a high mark to her.  Instead, your photo will be shown among the first to your potential elect.  If he gives you a high ball, then you will meet. <br>  <b>Prospects:</b> foggy.  While the site is hopelessly behind its main competitor picred.com. <br><br>  <a href="http://home-money.ru/">home-money.ru</a> - <b>Home Accounting Online</b> <br>  The site offers you to bring all your income and expenses.  There are many local services of home accounting, most of them are paid.  home-money.ru is absolutely free for now, otherwise it is not much different from such programs. <br>  <b>Prospects:</b> no, a lot of software analogues. <br><br>  <a href="http://minibanda.ru/">minibanda.ru</a> - <b>Miniband</b> <br>  Service for young mothers and those who are just waiting for a child.  Blogs, community. <br>  <b>Perspectives:</b> It may become a noticeable project in its subject matter, but most likely it will remain average. <br><br>  <a href="http://maskas.ru/">maskas.ru</a> - <b>Mask collective blog.</b> <br>  Blog charade  Everyone can put on a mask and write to the blog from someone else.  For example, on behalf of Putin, Saakashvili, or a famous network figure. <br>  <b>Prospects</b> : foggy. <br><br>  <a href="http://klavogonki.ru/">klavogonki.ru</a> - <b>Klavagonki</b> <br>  Competitions with each other at the speed of typing. <br>  <b>Perspectives</b> : None.  A game that quickly annoys.  You can play day, week, month.  What's next? <br><br>  <a href="http://spfan.ru/">spfan.ru</a> - <b>community of South Park lovers</b> <br>  Not a bad project for South Park fans. <br>  <b>Prospects</b> : Popularity among fans of the series.  Slow dying after stopping the show. <br><br>  <a href="http://biztro.ru/">biztro.ru</a> - <a href="http://biztro.ru/">IOU</a> <b>service</b> <br>  Want to witness your friend's debt?  Then you are with him here.  The meaning, however, of such an action is incomprehensible.  Is that the service acts as a third party. <br>  <b>Prospects</b> : in this form there. <br><br>  <a href="http://webdown.ru/">A copy of the blog</a> <br><br>  <b>PS</b>  <b>I‚Äôll clarify</b> : those who started in 2008 are here. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/37702/">https://habr.com/ru/post/37702/</a></p>
