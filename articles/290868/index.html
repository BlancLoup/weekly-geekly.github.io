However, few people know how to create a first-class customer support service.  Exceptionally polite communication with customers is not enough.  Employees need to master the mass of techniques, and only then they will become masters of support. <br><br>  To help you with this, today we begin a series of articles in which we will share useful tips and observations.  We present to your attention the top three. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  1) Look for points of contact </h4><br>  We are more sympathetic to those who are like us.  Moreover, this similarity can be in anything: occupation, name, interest or opinion.

      This principle works well in customer support.  It is enough to spend a few minutes studying the client's site and its social profile, as communication becomes more alive and relaxed. <br><br>  <b>Mediocre communication</b> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/9d0/eb3/a3a/9d0eb3a3aa2c41448f59f6583cdd5f5f.png"><br><br>  <b>Correspondence with the addition of common interests</b> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ae4/a1f/1aa/ae4a1f1aa5cc498c8998e13108f31447.png"><br><br><h4>  2) Avoid the official style </h4><br>  Clients are not gloomy people in expensive suits who prefer dry communication ‚Äúon business‚Äù.  Like you, they are not alien to human emotions.  Therefore, abandon the official manner of communication.  It is appropriate in rare cases, and the rest - only spoils the impression.  Be friendly and empathetic. <br><br>  <i>How can I respond to this appeal?</i> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/fae/811/bce/fae811bce6d34b31b5c6cbcd6775f7ee.png"><br><br>  <b>Dry and formal</b> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/368/7b0/04b/3687b004b42e477ea6deee42791be25d.png"><br><br>  <b>Humanely</b> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/35b/11b/94c/35b11b94c862444499d2d834e688c42a.png"><br><br><h4>  3) Learn to close </h4><br>  The ability to properly "close" is priceless, and it is not about concluding a deal, but about ending communication with a client. <br><br>  If the client has a feeling that he was not fully helped, it means that you have coped poorly with your task.  Before completing the communication, you need to make sure that every issue raised by the client has been resolved. <br><br>  Following this principle will bring to the client three important points: <br><br><ul><li>  you really want to understand the task ahead; </li><li>  you are ready to continue until you understand everything correctly; </li><li>  only he decides what is "right." </li></ul><br>  Always help the client until he himself says that he is satisfied with everything and he has no more questions. <br><br>  <i>How can I complete this appeal?</i> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/521/3e3/7a2/5213e37a2ea945e383a692775bf37c53.png"><br><br>  <b>"Lubricated" and tired</b> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/39d/0ad/f5d/39d0adf5d2b4445ea499492e43849716.png"><br><br>  The last answer the employee makes it clear that he has completed his part and can hardly help with anything.  The client found a way out, but did not understand the causes of the problem.  He closed the appeal, although in fact the employee forced him to do so. <br><br>  The final response of the employee often spoils the impression of good communication in general.  Do not even think of "disown" at the end, if you laid out in the process of correspondence. <br><br>  <b>Without lowering the bar</b> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a0e/abb/728/a0eabb728b15476bb96f868ec6896b91.png"><br><br>  The employee brought the case to the end.  He not only helped to solve the problem, but also explained the reason for its occurrence.  As a result, the client was satisfied and made it clear that the issue was settled. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/290868/">https://habr.com/ru/post/290868/</a></p>
