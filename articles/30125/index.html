      It all started with a laptop bag.  True, I wanted only a piece of skin over my shoulder, in which you can comfortably carry your IBM.  It would seem - what's the problem, come to any store so buy. <br>  After I visited four stores in Moscow and superficially studied the offers of Russian Internet sellers, my enthusiasm faded away: either the price of 15,000 rubles, or the size that is no longer suitable for 11 ";  laptop, and for compact packaging of a colony of hippos. <br><br>  As a result, the problem was solved by ordering a bag at a factory in Italy for 5,000 rubles with delivery to Moscow in 3 days, thereby rediscovering the possibilities of online shopping. <br><br><h1>  1. Prices. </h1><br>  It‚Äôs not for me to tell you that in Europe and the USA clothes, shoes, and almost everything is actually several times cheaper than in the Russian Federation.  Why?  All together we thank our legislation and personally some distributors. <br><br>  In principle, living, for example, in Sarov, you can easily buy Lacost shoes for 1500 rubles, Levi's jeans for 750 rubles, and luxury shoes, hand-knitted sweaters or Italian bags will be delivered to your home in a few days right from the factory, and the price will be comparable to the price of Chinese junk. <br><br>  Whoever does not believe can see the prices in the already quite pop shops <a href="http://jcp.com/">JCPenney</a> and <a href="http://www.landsend.com/">Lands' End</a> . <br><br><h1>  2. Where to find stores that deliver to the Russian Federation </h1><br>  Here Google will help you, find, register, try to choose delivery in the Russian Federation, maybe you are lucky.  Of course, in the following reviews I will share the experience of delivering goods from other stores, but nobody canceled the independent search. <br><br><h1>  3. How to pay? </h1><br>  Either by credit card or PayPall (although in this case a credit card is also needed). <br>  You can have a plastic card at any bank, the main thing is no DinnersClub, AmericanExpress, only Visa or MasterCard. <br><br>  You cannot pay for Visa Electron or Maestro purchases, but you can, for example, order Visa Electron and make Visa ec @ rd additional to it.  Then through Visa Electron you replenish an account with an ATM, Visa ec @ rd - directly to pay for purchases.  Considering that additional cards can sometimes cost you nothing, and Visa Electron service is cheaper than Visa Classic, you can even save a little on banking parasites. <br><br>  The cost of servicing the card ~ 300r.  in YEAR, so there is nothing terrible in the design. <br><br>  For details - to bank employees, they will tell you everything, they love clients' <s>money</s> , that is a fact. <br><br><h1>  4. Shipping. </h1><br>  Sometimes you can choose the delivery option yourself.  Sometimes you will find out about this after deducting funds from the card, but this is what my article is for, so that everyone shares their experiences in the comments.  Delivery can begin from $ 20 and come to an end with several thousand dollars if you want to deliver the rotor excavator. <br><br>  All delivery services can be divided into two groups: courier services (DHL, FedEX, UPS) and State Mail (Russian Post, USPS in the USA - !!! not to be confused with UPS !!, Royal Mail in the UK, ...) <br>  The state mail has an express delivery service - EMS, perhaps, Muscovites noticed numerous van flashing here and there in traffic jams. <br><br>  State mail - delivery is longer, you have to go to the post office to receive the parcel, as well as to draw the scribbles in the notice that you drop into the mailbox.  But cheaper.  There is another important advantage, which you will read further. <br><br>  DHL, FedEX, UPS - fast and expensive.  In the case of DHL is very expensive (they are extortionists, read further), in the case of FedEX it is very, very expensive, but it‚Äôs not a fact that the goods will be delivered (although they say the situation has changed for the better lately, but the real severe IT specialists do not believe for nefik).  Thus, UPS elimination is the best. <br><br><h1>  5. Customs. </h1><br>  If you live in Ukraine - this article is not for you, buy further Levi's from baryg with peace of mind, or change the law. <br><br>  If you live in Russia - everything is simple, you can deliver the goods once a week for an amount of no more than 5,000 rubles by courier services (DHL, FedEX, UPS), or for 10,000 rubles by state mail (including EMS). <br><br>  If you exceed the amount, you will have to meet with customs officials.  They are not scary and do not bite, bite DHL and FedEX. <br>  Customs officers will be asked to pay customs duty and VAT (most often - 18% + 20%, that is, dohrena).  If DHL or UPS delivered - you will have to pay the entire amount of the goods (well, for example, on Monday delivered 4,000 rubles, and on Friday 4,000 rubles - 8,000 a week came, that's from this amount and pay all fees). <br><br>  If the state mail delivered - only from the difference between 10,000 rubles and the amount of your goods (another example - delivered goods by 12,000 rubles by mail - pay already 30%, but not from 12,000 rubles, but from 2,000 rubles, that is, the difference between the value of the goods and 10,000 rubles).  Thus, the state mail is not only slow, but also cheap.  So decide for yourself what to deliver. <br><br>  Yes, under the law "you can deliver ONCE TO A WEEK (calendar) ..." <br>  I think this legislation would even work in our country if anyone at the customs conducted an electronic database of parcels.  But since everyone doesn‚Äôt care for everything, and no one leads the counting of shipments, you can safely transport to Moscow and St. Petersburg once a day - there are a lot of goods, everyone will forget about you in a couple of hours.  If you live in the provinces, you have to be careful, take three breaks a day. <br><br>  More details in which the devil itself is hidden. <br><br>  How do customs officers determine the value of your cargo, does it exceed 5,000 rubles or not? <br>  There is such a term: customs value. <br>  So, by law, this cost includes the cost of the purchase, plus the cost of insurance of the goods, plus the cost of shipping the goods.  The cost of the purchase is determined on the basis of the Invoice (invoice), which goes stuck with adhesive tape to the box with your purchase. <br><br>  Some good shops can safely lower the cost of goods in the Invoice by half.  Some shops from their kindness reach senility and write "Donation" (Gift).  So, if the seller (do not worry about online shopping, this usually does not happen, but on eBay - very often) wrote suddenly in the Invoice Gift, the Russian Customs officer is already eagerly rubbing his hands. <br>  The fact is that in our legislation there is no Gift concept, so the price is determined independently by the customs officer.  This price can be determined on the basis of catalogs (most often outdated;)), the market price on the Internet, or simply the guys will require an extract from your bank card to confirm expenses (and then pay for delivery immediately).  That is, there are a lot of chances to stumble upon customs duties in the case of Gift. <br><br>  If you greatly underestimate the cost of the goods (for example, MacBookAir is new in the package, estimate at $ 100) - the customs officer will not believe you and will be right in his own way.  After that, a standard procedure for determining the market price and payment of customs duties by you. <br><br>  Now, about the cost of insurance and delivery.  If legal entities cannot avoid including the cost of delivery in the customs value, then everything is simple for individuals - if the cost of delivery is included in the invoice, then it is taken into account when calculating customs duties, if not included in the invoice - then it is not taken into account. <br><br>  Ask burzhuinov not include the cost of delivery in the Invoice is useless, because  It‚Äôs not too strange to work for them, too, so if there is no information about whether the store includes invoice delivery costs or not, be careful when delivering the goods for the first time.  Then you will make any conclusions yourself and be able to relax. <br><br>  And now actually the most vile details that relate to DHL and FedEX. <br><br>  Imagine for a minute that the cost of your package is suddenly 5400r., And the customs officer was in a bad mood so that you simply forgive these 400 rubles. <br>  Then they call you, or maybe the staff of DHL and FedEX come, and they persistently impose the services of a customs broker, that is, a person who arranges everything as it should be quickly and on time (for example, for 400 bucks).  Since there is nothing difficult in self-registration of goods, you just have to arrive at the customs, and there they will tell you how and what, then you politely refuse the services of a customs broker DHL or FedEX (for example, for 400 bucks). <br><br>  In this case, everything depends on the adequacy of the staff of these courier services, it is possible that you will get a tantrum and a threat to send your parcel back to the sender without returning money for transportation in retaliation for not wanting to order the services of a customs broker (for example, for 400 bucks).  Take more air into your lungs, breathe evenly and insist on your own - ‚ÄúI do not need your nasty services!‚Äù Then they will be left behind. <br><br>  Thus, make out a card, look for shops, buy, order delivery either by UPS or by mail (Royal Mail, USPS), watch the limit (5,000 rubles or 10,000 rubles when delivered by mail), look for reviews of purchases in a particular store and happy! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/30125/">https://habr.com/ru/post/30125/</a></p>
