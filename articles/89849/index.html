      <b>1. A</b> correspondence tour was held until January 31, any student could send his report to one of the following categories: <br><br><ul><li>  Cryptography.  Relevance in modern society. </li><li>  Modern cybercrime. </li><li>  Antivirus technology.  Methods for detecting and preventing computer threats.  Means of analysis and testing of modern means of protection. </li><li>  Computer threats.  Threats to mobile devices. </li><li>  Analysis of spam and anti-spam technology.  Spam detection methods with and without content analysis.  Phishing </li><li>  Network security </li><li>  Educational projects (training programs and methods) in the field of computer security. </li><li>  Economic models and analytical aspects of information security. </li><li>  Innovative and patentable antivirus technologies of the future. </li></ul><br><br>  <b>2.</b> Until February 25 (the truth was actually a little longer), the program committee determined the winners in each nomination, which then paid for travel and accommodation in Moscow.  Also, each participant in the correspondence tour could come at his own expense (and I did, though I went at the expense of the uni). <br><br>  <b>3.</b> The first day was held at the Moscow State University, here participants of the conferences mostly spoke.  I will write more about this below. <br>  <b>4. The</b> second day was spent at Kaspersky Lab.  Here the experts of the Laboratory mainly spoke, a tour of the Laboratory was held, the results were summed up, the finalists were determined, who will perform in the finals in Krakow April 23-25.  I will write about this in the next article (of course, if the topic interests anyone) <br><br>  Now more about each stage. <br><br>  There is nothing special to say about the first stage.  Whoever wanted - chose any topic suitable for a specific category, wrote a report on it (or rewrote his graduate thesis) and sent it to the organizers.  There‚Äôs nothing much to add :) <br><br>  At the second stage, the program committee determined the best works in each nomination by the following criteria: <br><br><ul><li>  Practical significance </li><li>  Social significance </li><li>  Innovative significance </li><li>  The overall level of work, the depth of consideration of the topic, </li></ul><br><br>  The <a href="http://www.kasperskyacademy.com/ru/it_security_conference_participate">following participants</a> became the winners of the correspondence tour.  I will not give here a complete list, who are interested - look at the link.  Below about each performance I will write separately (name, subject of work, photo of the participant) <br><br>  We settled participants in the Universitetskaya Hotel (not far from Moscow State University, where the first day of the conference was held). <br>  On the morning of March 29 at the reception we were met by a driver with a sign "Kaspersky Lab" <br><img src="http://pikucha.ru/365851/IMG_2652.jpeg" alt="image"><br><br>  After everyone got together, we were taken to Moscow State University (by the way, we would have walked much faster :)) <br>  An unwelcoming security guard was waiting for us at MSU, who at first didn‚Äôt want to let us in at all :) Somehow, they were convinced that we were going to the conference.  Then they took the badges with their names from the table so that there would be no further problems with the guards. <br><img src="http://pikucha.ru/365866/DSC_3051.jpeg" alt="image"><br><br>  Not everyone gathered right away (as we remember, it was precisely that day that terrorist attacks occurred in Moscow, so not all arrived on time. Fortunately, none of the participants / spectators were hurt). <br>  As usual, it all started with technical problems :) Something was wrong with the sound in the video (codec settings were lost).  After half an hour, the shamanism repaired the sound and provided us with a video message by Evgeny Kaspersky (he flew away again to some kind of business trip, so he was not present).  After the video, the conference organizers turned to the conference organizers and painted a work plan.  According to the regulations, 15 minutes were given for each report (including questions from the audience and the program committee). <br>  The conference has begun. <br><img src="http://pikucha.ru/365879/DSC_3101.jpeg" alt="image"><br><br>  The first was Tkachev Dmitry with the work " <i>Analysis of the level of protection of wireless networks based on the wi-fi technology of the city of Novosibirsk</i> ". <br><img src="http://pikucha.ru/365889/DSC_3124.jpeg" alt="image"><br><br>  The following work was from Lyzhonkov Dmitry - " <i>Development of a model of an epidemic of computer viruses</i> " <br><img src="http://pikucha.ru/365939/DSC_3199.jpeg" alt="image"><br><br>  Next on the program - Mardanova Natalia with the report " <i>Organization of information protection in networks of the IEEE 802.16e standard</i> " <br><img src="http://pikucha.ru/365940/DSC_3231.jpeg" alt="image"><br><br>  The following report presented to our attention Beshentseva Maria.  Her report was called " <i>Educational Project for Students of Higher Education Institutions for Countering Cyber-Terrorism</i> ". <br><img src="http://pikucha.ru/366203/DSC_3251.jpeg" alt="image"><br><br>  And the last report before the coffee-break was from Borodina Kristina - ‚Äú <i>Cyber ‚Äã‚Äãfraud against children</i> ‚Äù. <br><img src="http://pikucha.ru/366204/DSC_3293.jpeg" alt="image"><br><br>  After the coffee break, we were awaited by a presentation from Sergey Novikov, a virus analyst at the Russian Research Center for Modern Computer Threats.  After a short report in which he told about the main trends in the development of computer threats, he suggested that the audience divide into groups and forecast the development of threats for 2010, 2011-2014, 2020. <br><img src="http://pikucha.ru/366218/DSC_3321.jpeg" alt="image"><br><br>  The discussion was very lively and very productive.  Below I posted a few photos of the discussion of different groups. <br><br><img src="http://pikucha.ru/365964/DSC_3345.jpeg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="http://pikucha.ru/365965/DSC_3358.jpeg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="http://pikucha.ru/365966/DSC_3372.jpeg" alt="image"><br><br>  After the end of the discussion in groups, they called one representative from each group in order to talk about the results of the brainstorming session.  There were different versions, some very original.  One comrade suggested a scheme for matching real epidemics and viral ones: <br><br><img src="http://pikucha.ru/366229/DSC_3387.jpeg" alt="image"><br><br>  Certainly very original, but also very doubtful :) <br><br>  And finally, after the performance of all groups, Sergei Novikov took the floor.  He told us about the results of a brainstorming conducted by analysts at Kaspersky Lab on the same issue.  And, oddly enough, almost everything coincided with the results of our brainstorming :) <br><br>  After that, dinner was announced, on the board drew a diagram of the passage to the dining room. <br><br>  PS Plans to continue writing in 3 parts: <br>  1. Afternoon part of the 1st day (several reports, a workshop from Timur Biyachuev, presentations from Sergey Golovanov and Alexey Tikhonov) <br>  2. 2nd day (already at Kaspersky Lab).  There will be one student report, several reports from experts of the Laboratory, summing up, awarding prizes <br>  3. Excursion to Kaspersky Lab (I do not know whether to write or not. I am waiting for comments on the subject) <br><br>  PPS Probably should have been transferred to Information Security.  If suddenly I have enough karma, I will throw it :) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/89849/">https://habr.com/ru/post/89849/</a></p>
