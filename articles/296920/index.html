      What is it for?  Let's answer with a quote from a great advertiser Claude Hopkins: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/bf5/ba2/70c/bf5ba270c27d4004a4da6800f61c9c79.jpg"><br><br>  The technique is simple: in order to master it, you do not need to learn copywriting skills at trainings and pay money for it (for example, Dmitry Kota, intensive, costs 19,000 rubles).  It is enough to learn how to formulate your value proposition in 4 elements. <br><br>  So let's go.  Parse step by step on a specific example.  Theme - sale of GPS-monitoring systems for vehicles. <br><br>  <b>Usefulness (Usefulness)</b> <br><br>  This is the ultimate customer benefit.  What he wants to solve with your product or service.  Not search promotion (property), but increase in sales through search promotion (benefit).  Not real estate services, and the sale of a house or apartment.  In other words, not a drill, but holes in the wall. <br><br>  Utility is a must-have in the 4U model.  We begin with it.  This is usually a verb - save, reduce, save, protect, return, increase, multiply, double, get, earn.  Where appropriate - in the imperative mood (get, save, earn). <br><br>  “Pull out” the main benefit that interests your audience.  The options in our case, for which people put the GPS monitoring system - control, safety, saving money (by reducing downtime and left-wing drivers, optimizing routes and speed, customers get reduced fuel costs and T / O). <br><br>  Since 90% of Central Asia are transport companies, they are interested in financial gain.  Hence the usefulness - <b>"Reduce transportation costs</b> . <b>"</b> <br><br>  <b>Uniqueness</b> <br><br>  Also required element of the formula.  It means, due to what your profit works.  Product or service, ideally - with the adjustment of competitors.  Just do not “shout” that your product is the best or unique.  This is prohibited by the law on advertising, without valid evidence.  We have a soft option - <b>"New GPS monitoring system</b> . <b>"</b> <br><br>  To help - a list of stop words and phrases to be avoided: <br><br>  The best <br>  Cheap cheap <br>  Low prices <br>  Flexible terms <br>  Wide range of <br>  High quality, high quality <br>  Individual approach <br>  High reliability, reliable. <br><br>  <b>Ultra-specificity (Ultraspecificity)</b> <br><br>  Expresses favor in measurable units.  How much in rubles or interest you will increase sales or reduce costs;  how many hours or days will you deliver the product or provide a service and so on.  In our heading - <b>"Reduce costs to 32%</b> . <b>"</b> <br><br>  <b>Urgency</b> <br><br>  Time parameter  Moreover, this is not necessarily a deadline "before January 1" or "only the first 10 customers."  In some cases, you can do without it.  There is an advantageous time condition - set, no - reduce the circuit to 3U. <br><br>  In our title - <b>"Test Drive 14 days for free</b> . <b>"</b>  Yes, if urgency overloads the proposal, put it in the subtitle. <br><br>  As a result, we obtain: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/5f2/b3f/2ea/5f2b3f2ea69f4ba08c0a020cfbcabdbb.jpg"><br><br>  <b>Examples of headers in different niches</b> <br><br>  Once again we emphasize that it is not necessary to rest on all four parameters.  In many cases, it is quite enough to get by with utility, uniqueness and ultra-specificity. <br><br>  <b>B2B</b> <br><br>  "Reduce operating costs by 30% monthly with the help of Japanese hydraulic manipulators" <br><br>  “Accelerate forest loading 1.7 times with the help of KATO hydraulic manipulators” <br><br>  “In 24 hours we will install a video surveillance system at your facility at a price 20% lower than the market” <br><br>  "Repair of trade pavilions in 7 days from a construction holding company at the price of a private brigade" <br><br>  “Sale of ferrous metals: In 48 hours, Basis will collect an order for any item at the price of a conventional metal base” <br><br>  “Cleaning of warehouse and office premises with Karcher equipment from 400 rubles per sq. M.  When ordering today before 15.00 today the first cleaning is free » <br><br>  <b>B2C</b> <br><br>  “Save up to 40% on wall decoration with fiber-reinforced architectural elements” <br><br>  "Apartments in a small family cottage from the company" Stroypanelkomplekt "until the end of November at the price of" Khrushchev " <br><br>  “Save 22% of the cost of an apartment in December by purchasing during the construction phase” <br><br>  “Lose from 1.5 to 3.5 kg of excess weight in 21 days with Kangoo Jumps shoes” <br><br>  “IPhone6S on credit for only 93 rubles a day!  Bank agreement and gadget will bring straight home " <br><br>  “Forget about scratches on iPhone for 12 months with iShield protective film” <br><br>  “Speak in Spanish after 7 lessons on the author’s methodology of the Grand Espanol school.  Record until December 1 <br><br>  “We will approve a loan of up to 1,500,000 rubles without guarantors at a rate of 22.5% per annum.  Consideration of the application online for 24 hours <br><br>  "Smart house planning to the last outlet for 14 days from graduates of MARCHI" <br><br>  "Evaluation of land for 8 hours from the bureau" City Cadastre. "  When submitting the application before the end of the month - free registration of documents in the registration chamber " <br><br>  “Earn an additional 30,000 rubles a month on online trading using the iForex method” <br><br>  “Get any of our 19,500 products in 2 days thanks to the express delivery system” <br><br>  “Get a Toyota car suspension diagnostics on 15 parameters on a shaker table.

Let's prepare a holiday in 10 days, from the restaurant to the wedding car ” <br><br>  <b>Internet marketing and IT</b> <br><br>  “In 30 days we will do a Landing page with a conversion of&gt; 10% or return the money under the contract” <br><br>  “Increase online sales by 25% through online surveys of your customers.  14 days free version » <br><br>  “We will list 10 new customers tomorrow when ordering SEO promotion today before 6:00 pm” <br><br>  “Increase in conversion by 12-15% with the first results already after 3 days with the help of Express Usability” <br><br>  “Receive 3 times more calls and requests from contextual advertising for the same money with the help of adaptive content.  Free setup until December 31 <br><br>  <b>Fifth Element</b> <br><br>  This 4U formula enhancer is not suitable for all options, but wherever SEO is planned.  The fifth element is the key phrase in the title.  Two examples: <br><br>  " <b>Hydraulic manipulators for wood:</b> reduction of operating costs by 30% per month with Japanese KATO equipment" <br><br>  " <b>Realtor services in Moscow</b> from the company" Metry ": we will sell your object in 3 months - or with a commission of 0 rubles" <br><br>  PS Ask questions about using the 4U model in your niche.
