That is, such moments when working with tablets of goals and time becomes a chore.  Well, yes, in the morning and in the evening we mark the passing time.  So what?  After all, it is better to evaluate the motivating factor of time in some quantitative and descriptive criteria.  Many perfectly logical color pinachik.  One color for a productive day, the other for a so-so day.  However, after a short time, it becomes clear that this kind of assessment leads to a quite predictable result: the ratio of time hovers around 50 to 50. The statistics of the wonderful service <a href="http://worktrek.ru/">Worktrek.ru show</a> this perfectly: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/093/d91/770/093d917707ee4089fa3a7b24649286ef.jpg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  54% vs. 46%.  And is it worth messing with pinarik if the result is so predictable?  It is worth, if you add it pindikatorom.  First, consider the principle, and then - one of the possible ways of implementation. <br><br>  1. Every day of our life in one way or another includes elements of "global areas".  For example, Bodo Schaefer defines five such areas: "Health, finance, communication, emotions, the meaning of life."  But Alex Shalman - already ten: "Health and sports, education, career and money, public relations, home and family, character, emotions, habits, life purpose, spiritual development."  I am sure that the essence is clear, and everyone is able to identify such areas for himself personally.

      2. Each of the selected areas of life necessarily needs attention and development.  Moreover, attention and development are daily activities.  It may be insignificant, but daily. <br><br><habracut>  3. In each area of ‚Äã‚Äãinterest to us, a small group of actions is identified that are consistently and systematically introduced into the habit.  How - it will be seen below. <br><br>  4. Every day activities are given on a scale from 0 to 3. 0 - not done, 1 - an attempt was made, 2 - completed, 3 - became a habit.  And we derive the average score of the day.  But besides this - also the average score for the last 10 days.  On the graph below, you will see that the instantaneous value of the day, although interesting, is much more important - the ‚Äútrend.‚Äù  It shows in which direction human development is moving.  Growth or a flat plateau is normal, but the fall suggests that it will take at least a week to straighten out.  So maybe it's easier not to foil your own plans? <br><br>  5. Daily we answer ourselves to a group of the same questions.  In writing.  With the accumulation of information, this is a structured diary.  An example will be shown below. <br><br>  That's all about principles. <br><br>  Variants of technical execution of the indicator as many as you like - from a spreadsheet to a web service.  I like, for example, such, sharpened under the Internet, implemented by one of the supporters of the method.  Suppose if you decide to use it, then it may look like this. <br><br>  1. Every day at 23.00 a letter with a reminder from the Google-calendar comes to your inbox. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/8f0/baa/b9f/8f0baab9f7e714dd69a2e6e1c0f52bb9.jpg"><br>  The letter contains what you yourself wrote on your calendar, creating a daily recurring task with email notification.  For example, the composition of the letter may be: <br><br>  References: <br>  <a href="http://spreadsheets.google.com/%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B0%25D1%2588%25D0%25B0_%25D1%2582%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B1%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B8%25D1%2586%25D0%25B0">spreadsheets.google.com/your_table</a> - table in Google documents <br>  <a href="">www.livejournal.com/update.bml</a> - to go to the record in LJ. <br>  Your_LJ + pincode@post.livejournal.com - email address for posting in LJ by mail. <br><br>  G: ||  Pin: This line is placed in the header of the letter sent to LiveJournal.  G is a subjective assessment of the day, from 0 to 3. Pin is what the table will show. <br>  lj-tags: g #, Day is a string of LJ tags.  Since weekly reviews are also being written, the Week tag allows you to select and read them separately. <br><br>  Morning: <br>  Day: <br>  Evening: <br>  Main impression: <br>  Novelty Factor: <br>  Discipline Factor: <br>  Lessons of the day: <br>  Notes: <br><br>  So, the first click you open the letter in a couple of seconds, the second you open the link to the table: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/867/b95/705/867b9570542926584a9f0b3e2bb5e132.jpg"><br><br>  In a few more movements, make an honest assessment on the areas of life in the current day line (position No. 8).  In this example, the user has seven areas that he wants to control and develop.  Seven times for three seconds is twenty one seconds to the two previous clicks, for a total of half a minute per procedure. <br><br>  As a result, you get two graphs - a bar chart of instantaneous values ‚Äã‚Äã(# 1) and a linear chart - of average values ‚Äã‚Äãfor a period (# 6).  Column number 4 - the average values ‚Äã‚Äãfor the day, and column number 5 - the average for the last 10 days.  And, in general, only it matters.  Line number 3 - the average indicator for the development of the area of ‚Äã‚Äãlife, can be both for the entire period, and for arbitrary.  From this line, we see that the user of the pindicator achieved the greatest success in the fight against vampire kidnappers of time.  But with the sport and daily routine - so-so picture, and no need to build illusions.  Note position number 7 - the lines are hidden for convenience. <br><br>  Important point: we regularly raise the bar.  That is, if the composition of the activities of the TM-process area included a couple of regular tasks, then as soon as we learned to consistently perform them at the level of 1.5-2 points, we replace them with others and continue to grow.  On the user's graph, positive (green lines) and negative (red lines) trends are clearly visible.  Although the bar chart shows that at certain periods the user specifically freezes, rather than raising the bar.  But it is not so scary, the main thing is to return to the process, continuing to spin the efficiency flywheel. <br><br>  Having received two figures in 30 seconds - 1.06 and 1.32, you copy the contents of the letter marked in blue into the buffer, click on the link with the email address for LJ-posting and write a diary entry: <br><br>  G: 2 ||  Pin: + 1.06 / + 1.32 is a letter subject field. <br>  lj-tags: g2, day <br><br>  Morning: What did you do in the morning <br>  Day: What happened in the afternoon <br>  Evening: What did you do in the evening? <br>  Main impression: What impressed in this day <br>  Novelty Factor: What is new you consciously practiced <br>  Discipline Factor: What element was performed on moral and volitional. <br>  Lessons of the day: What did this day teach? <br>  Notes: Reflections with and without <br><br>  A total of five more minutes. <br><br>  As a result, the LJ turns out a series of standard posts of very valuable content: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/9b5/612/fcc/9b5612fccc0d4ca00e77a8a2964b2909.jpg"><br>  Through tags we see a picture of the user of technology: <br>  G1 - 26 times (bad days) <br>  G2 - 63 times (ordinary days) <br>  G3 - 8 times (great days) <br>  We can click on the G3 and read what this eight class days were among the ninety-seven past.  But in general, of course, modestly.  I remember a sad anecdote, well, the one about the inscriptions on the Caucasian cemetery: "He lived for three years ... He lived for five years." <br><br>  The post header column also provides valuable information: <br>  G: 1 ||  Pin: -1.11 \ -1.08 <br>  G: 2 ||  Pin: -1.13 \ +1.09 <br>  G: 2 ||  Pin: +1.24 \ +1.07 <br>  G: 2 ||  Pin: +1.07 \ +1.05 <br><br>  Setting up the system once we spend only 3-5 minutes a day in order to get the most important self-diagnosis.  You can do this in the manner described above.  I personally have long used a simple database in Access.  Many of those who were motivated to work with the folder are limited to a spreadsheet, both for the diary and for the calculation. <br><br>  So, pindikator can be compared with the speedometer.  By the way, another joke. <br>  A desert, a man crawls, stumbles upon a jug, rubs - and from there comes gin. <br>  - Well, say one wish, what you want. <br>  - I want to go home!  - the man wheezes. <br>  - Okay, let's go. <br>  - But I want fast! <br>  - Then ran. <br><br>  To get from Moscow to St. Petersburg in an hour and a half, you need a plane.  It is possible and by train, but then 6-8 hours.  You can walk.  But it is very long.  If the pindicator shows that the efficiency of a person is somewhere in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe plinth, then why did he decide that he would achieve the very goals that he proudly identified in the Pinarik?  Pindicator clearly shows bottlenecks and allows thinking globally - to act locally.  The main thing is to act after all, hour after hour, day after day.  And at some point you suddenly realize that an!  - you have changed.  You are already different.  That seems to have crawled quite recently, but in comparison with many others walking, you fly.  Yes, falls, breakdowns and kickbacks are inevitable, we are not robots.  However, you know what the difference between a winner and a loser is?  That's right, the only difference is that the winner rose one more time. </habracut></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/68078/">https://habr.com/ru/post/68078/</a></p>
