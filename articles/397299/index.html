  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Tasty Chicken</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Flight to the nearest star is very long.  But what if there is no other choice?  A ‚ÄúShadow‚Äù class spacecraft has been plowing space for several decades.  The purpose of such a long cruise journey is to find a new Earth.  Find a place that two hundred passengers and a crew of thirty people can call home. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/533/593/d9b/533593d9bfef3e236b2ff661fd7a7a6a.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Jessica occupies the position of a nurse on the ship, and copes well with her duties.  Her son Tommy, a boy of seven, was born no longer on Earth, and had never seen a blue sky or a sea.  Yes, what to be cunning, he did not see anything earthly.  Tommy was especially worried that he would not be able to meet live with terrestrial animals, about which he loved to read books and watch holographic films.  Most of all he liked pandas and kangaroos.  And as soon as the book on ornithology came into Tommy's hands, she immediately became his favorite reading matter before bed.  With great interest, he looked at the pictures of ostriches, eagles, pelicans, pigeons and hens. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Mama often told Tommy that there was a whole hen farm on the space ship, but she never showed them.  But every day, for dinner, Tommy ate wonderful chicken meat, so tasty that his plate by the end of the meal always remained eaten to the last bite.

      And most of all, Tommy did not like to be tested.  It so happened that at the end of each month, throughout the flight, the passengers and the entire crew of the ship lined up near the medical compartment, waiting for their turn to put their hands inside the huge white box, which hurt with something sharp in the palm.  After testing, Tommy had a small triangular mark for two or three days, which, however, quickly healed and didn‚Äôt hurt.  Only slightly itched. <br><br>  Once Tommy flatly refused to go to take tests, which is very upset Jessica.  And the point is not that he was capricious, not at all.  Jessica never forced her son to do anything by force.  He was always a good boy, and if his mother had a little talked about him, he would have lost anyway.  But Jessica did not persuade him.  She only sighed sadly and said that today she would be left without a fried chicken for dinner.  Of course, Tommy did not believe her, and was very surprised when, at dinner, only artificially synthesized nutrients in capsules and mashed potatoes turned out to be on his plate.  Not even a hint of a chicken. <br><br>  Seeing the upset face of her son, she pulled her plate to him, and said that she did not want to be fried today.  But Tommy didn‚Äôt like the fried chicken from mother‚Äôs plate.  His chicken was much tastier!  The next day, Tommy himself ran to his mother in the medical compartment, and with a smile put his hand into the device for analysis.  In the evening, he was again awaited delicious chicken for dinner. <br><br>  Tommy was the first in the line to pass tests today.  Jessica stroked her head with a smile while he waited patiently, holding his palm in the laboratory setup.  Following Tommy, the captain of the ship went to take tests.  ‚ÄúWell done, you are a real man,‚Äù said Captain Tommy. ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt even show my mind that it hurt you.‚Äù <br><br>  ‚ÄúIt wasn‚Äôt painful at all, it‚Äôs just boring and long,‚Äù Tommy thought, but he didn‚Äôt disappoint the captain and decided to keep this secret a secret.  Let the captain think that he really is a real man! <br><br>  When the stream of people willing to pass tests dried up, Jessica opened the laboratory apparatus, and took out a small tray with neat cells containing the biomaterial of each crew member and passenger of the starship.  Placing the tray in a small case cooler, she went with him to the bioengineering laboratory. <br><br>  Jessica's duties included the timely placement of biomaterial in cloning facilities.  And the cloning units were provided absolutely for every person on the spaceship - in an emergency, you could always grow a new kidney or limb from a biomaterial that Jessica collected every month.  But emergency cases on the ship happened very rarely, so cloning installations were constantly used only for synthesizing muscle tissue.  Yes, for each person on the ship every day their own muscle tissue was grown.  Jessica, like Tommy, also had her secrets. <br><br>  But someday she will tell him that there is no ship on the ship, and there have never been any chickens ... </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/397299/">https://habr.com/ru/post/397299/</a></p>
