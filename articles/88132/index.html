And without asking what documents are allowed to information that can be used for personal gain.  My opinion is wrong! <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  I do not remember where I began to notice this, but I remember one of the early events clearly.  I studied at that time in the Kuzbass State Pedagogical Academy.  It was the fourth course, it is time to practice.  They gathered us and distributed them to educational institutions, all the lyceums, not bad, prestigious, like.  I fell 11th lyceum.  It is a good lyceum, good responsive teachers.  Many people like this lyceum, but one thing upset me a little.  In this (and in all educational institutions where I did my practice, except for the 84th lyceum), no one asked me a document certifying that I was a student.  If there is a guard, then it must at least somehow fulfill its functions.  On the first day we came, seemed to be the head teacher, we were scattered in classes and that's it.  Walk, practice.  The first thing I would do was transfer the lists with the full name to the same security post.  All students have, and so they will know that the student who is doing the practice has come.  Okay, go to the Lyceum is half the battle.  So I also got access to information about the students and their parents, for "honest word".  I came to the teachers' room, in which no one knew me (the beginning of the practice, there was no head teacher), and saying that I was a student in practice, without presenting a student passport, which can be checked with official documents, I get access to a class magazine.  And in it it is written on the last pages by whom and where the parents of certain students work.  Also to the personal affairs of students.  Now imagine that I am a bad person who wants to kidnap a child of some rich uncle / aunt.  I have access to a journal, to a personal matter.  It remains to choose the richer sacrifice and go!  Well, not so! <br><br>  But another bright and crying fact of irresponsibility and negligence!  I work now in one bank, those.  employee and by the nature of their activities are closely related to computer hardware and ATMs.  But that's not the point.  The boss calls and forgive me to go to one point, take a picture of an ATM.  Then go to the Novokuznetsk subdivision of the Kuzbass branch of the West-Siberian railway, JSC Russian Railways, give the photos to be sent by internal mail to Kemerovo.  No sooner said than done.  I take a camera, come, take pictures and go to the subdivision.  I go without any problems, I introduce myself as a bank employee on the watch and ask how to get into some kind of NMS (I don‚Äôt know the decryption), find out the way and go wandering along the corridors.  As a result, I descend to the basement and meet there some people who are interested in where the NHC.  I answer that they ask what I want.  I explain that I am an employee of the bank, I came to send photos.  The people think for a long time, not knowing what to answer, then they say that the employee, from whom it would be possible to send a photo, is not there and I can go into the office, sit at her computer and send the photo myself!  And at the same time, no documents!  What for?  Having sat down at the computer, I sent a photo and left, it took me about ten minutes until I reduced the photos, found the right address, etc.  During this time, no one asked for at least some kind of certificate, even the name and surname was not asked!  It would be easy to tyrit documents and any other information.  This is what happens, you can come to some kind of office, after knowing the name of the boss, while knowing that he is not there.  To say that the pier was agreed with him, that I need to check the computer‚Äôs performance or even the server (in small shops / offices there are not even admins, they can say that I am Petya, Vasya got sick and asked to be replaced) and thereby gain access to information.

      Such cases I can bring a lot.  But it is worth noting that there are still vigilant citizens, only the attitude to these is often far from positive.  Like, that he pulls me in small things?  For example, the authorities also needed photographs of the ATM and the room where it was installed.  It was the railway station of the city of Prokopyevsk.  Somewhere I heard that photo and video shooting at the stations is prohibited.  And only today, when writing an article, someone found something on the Internet: <i>‚ÄúThe prohibition on shooting railway objects is in the‚Äú Regulations on conducting television, video, film, and photography at public infrastructure facilities owned by JSC Russian Railways ‚Äù, approved by the Order of Russian Railways No. 1693p dated March 12, 2004. However, Russian Railways can set some rules only for its employees, therefore there are no reasons to force outsiders to comply with this document.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>In addition, this provision ‚Äúdoes not apply to surveys intended for personal use and carried out in passenger service stations at stations, stations, stopping points that do not interfere with or cause inconvenience and danger to the movement of passengers‚Äù (clause 3 of the Provision).</i>  <i>It regulates only the creation of news stories for the media and films, filming, the result of which will be used ‚Äúfor commercial purposes‚Äù, etc.</i>  <i>It does not prohibit ordinary amateur photography. "</i> That's not the point. If you have to commit evil at the station, they will do it without the help of cameras. So I come to the station, go to the first policeman and ask me to take me to the station commander. I am escorted, there I am I say hello, saying that I am from a bank and I need to take a picture. She says that they say dare. And I begin to take pictures. For this ingenious work, I‚Äôm caught by the same policeman who escorted me. And he says that you can‚Äôt take pictures at the station, what purpose  I do this and who I am at all. I say that I am an employee of the bank and that the management sent me to take a picture of the ATM installation place. He asks me to show him some document that would certify my identity. I calmly open the bag, I keep all the tools and a pass to the objects of Evrazholding, in which there is a photo, the full name and the fact that I am a bank employee, but I don‚Äôt find the document because I stupidly laid it out at work before going with a pile of documents.  And here I am standing in front of him, a suspicious guy, with a bag in which there are screwdrivers, screeds, pliers, nippers, a keyboard, a mouse, disks, wires, I have a camera in my hands and no documents.  He could not do otherwise than escort me to the head of the transport police.  There I again explained who I was, for what purpose and why.  They scolded me, said that they would not forget the documents in the future, write down all my data (name, date and year of birth, place of birth, registration, contact work phone number) and let me go.  I was saved only by the fact that in the hall I was waited by the cashier and collection and weapons, which confirmed my identity.  Otherwise, I would have been detained until it was clarified.  Praise and honor to these people!  Who would not say, as if he did not defend his rights, referring to official documents, but I say thank you, well done, watchfulness of the transport police at the station of Prokopyevsk city!  Arriving at the bank, I told the story and the management was preoccupied with employee IDs. <br><br>  Summing up, I would like to say that the vigilance of citizens, behind which stands at least some important, secret information, as well as the safety of citizens should not be reduced to nothing!  And if you do not agree with this, then try to put yourself in the shoes of these people.  And yet, stay human.  All you need is love </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/88132/">https://habr.com/ru/post/88132/</a></p>
