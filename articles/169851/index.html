I am 26 years old and I <s>bearded a</s> programmer with no higher education.  I would like to get it, but I could not.  I do not think that this is alien to you: instead of coming to the university and studying modern and interesting, they force you to learn Pascal under DOS. <br><br>  It's cute and funny, but I have absolutely no idea why I need it.  So I could not stand it - you understand what I mean.  On the other hand, without learning in any way, one has to constantly learn and much.  We all read articles and books on the Internet, but articles are usually very one-sided and incomprehensible, and books have to be read diagonally because of the tons of water in them.  What to do, you ask me, my dear Habr. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The university is not the only place where you can learn something.  In recent years, distance education has begun to flourish, there is an excellent article on <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/156241/">Habr√©</a> with the title ‚Äú <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/156241/">27+ resources for online learning</a> ‚Äù.  Excellent selection with one small exception - these are links to training there, and not with us, and in English.  I read technical literature freely and with fiction vocabulary, but such courses are given to me with difficulty. <br><br>  As is usually the case with us - if they do something useful and good, they will never tell about it (as they did not tell about <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/169887/">the Electro-L satellite</a> ).  Well, why?  Suddenly, people will use and they will be comfortable.

      Intel has cooperated with faculty members in laboratories at Nizhny Novgorod, St. Petersburg, and Novosibirsk State Universities and has developed several online courses for distance learning.  In Russian.  Is free.  With the issuance of certificates of completion of courses.  But nobody knows about it.  Except me.  And I'll tell you about it a little bit. <br><br>  The courses are created in three different levels of complexity, so the Hello world will not end there, but you will have to start with this hell.  Now you can get two types of certificates: Intel Parallel Programming Professional (IPPP) and Intel Mobile Programming Professional (IMPP). <br><br>  It is nice to look at the course about compilers, and at the same time understand that this is a modern course about modern compilers for modern processors and the course was written with the help of the company that develops these processors and the same compilers.  First-hand in Russian and for free.  There is also a Great Purpose - a certificate.  I do not know how much it helps in real life to find a job, but the certificate is pleasant at once for two reasons: firstly, it is interesting to receive it, and secondly, it will be followed by an independently completed course and a whole mountain of knowledge. <br><br>  And some students were lucky (for some reason I am sure that they are not even aware of this) and they can attend some of these courses directly as part of their university studies (guess where you need to study for this).  Well, anyone can sign up for a short course: feel like a student again and start attending lectures, and do practical tasks at night in order to surely get everything done by morning. <br><br>  <a href="http://www.intuit.ru/catalog/se/intel/">The full list of</a> courses I do not fit into the screen, and they are quite diverse on the topics.  While I was looking at it, I accidentally began to take a course on android, and I'm still interested.  I hope to receive the first certificate in my life. <br><br>  But, of course, there are nuances.  For example, in the welcome letter they warn you that it is not possible to simply communicate with a live teacher.  I do not know how true this is - so far I haven‚Äôt had such a need.  But you can chat on the forum with people who take the same course as you do. <br><br>  This greeting letter made me laugh: <br><blockquote>  Some students, after several unsuccessful attempts, write messages to the forum and letters to the administration and course authors that the system is not working properly - do not do it.  System is working properly </blockquote><br>  I still can not get rid of the feeling that he wrote a man who does not give a damn what he is doing.  A great rarity, by the way. <br><br><h2>  useful links </h2><br>  <a href="http://www.intuit.ru/catalog/se/intel/">Full list of courses</a> <br>  <a href="http://software.intel.com/ru-ru/articles/61843">Detailed description on the Intel website</a> <br>  <a href="http://nncc.unn.ru/">Nearest Short Term Courses</a> <br><br>  <strong>Upd</strong> : <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/ntz/" class="user_link">ntz</a> reports that: <br><blockquote>  Also, at the Ural State University for Educational Materials, Intel is currently taking a course on Optimizing the Performance of Computing Applications, dedicated to the Intel compiler and the Intel MKL library. </blockquote><br><br>  <strong>Upd</strong> : if you want to print a certificate and not just look at it on the Internet, then it will cost you some money, <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/fwhisper/" class="user_link">FWhisper</a> tells how much: <br><blockquote>  On Intuit, the electronic version in ‚Äúnormal‚Äù resolution (for viewing, inserting into blogs and documents, etc.) is free of charge (example <a href="http://www.intuit.ru/diplom/eCDFtYPcuDd6/P00180424/">in Russian</a> and <a href="http://www.intuit.ru/diplom/eCDFtYPcuDd6/A00180424/">in English</a> ).
