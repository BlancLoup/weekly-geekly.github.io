  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Dell and Alienware on Computex 2019: talk about the key updates</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The other day in Taipei, the Computex 2019 exhibition ends. Dell does not always take part in it, but it turned out that it was on this site that we presented a lot of new products from the consumer segment at once.  We hasten to briefly talk about all of them and even show live photos of gadgets straight from Taiwan.  Welcome under cat.  Spoiler: it is very interesting there! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/nd/gw/an/ndgwani5sg6sw45x3zlcev_se10.jpeg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  <font color="#3183c1">Dell XPS 13 (7390)</font> </h2><br>  The newest version of the XPS 13 transformer became the most important Dell product at Computex - it received the model index 7390. The general design concept is familiar to many people long ago: the computer has a wedge-shaped case made of metal and carbon fiber, and the elastic metal hinges in all positions are firmly held.  Compared with the XPS 13 (9365), the gadget has become a bit thinner.  But the rest is a completely different car. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/81/hr/xn/81hrxnqzxvxy7rp5d8esh72co4a.jpeg">

      <br>
      The first thing you notice immediately when you open the lid is a new display, the aspect ratio of which is now not 16: 9, but 16:10.  The diagonal is 13.4 inches, and the IPS matrix can be based on a resolution of either 1920x1200 or 3840x2400 pixels.  The maximum brightness in both cases reaches a level of 500 nits, and the coverage of the sRGB color space is 100%. <br><br>  In the first case, the contrast is 1500: 1, in the second - 1800: 1.  At the same time, a high-resolution screen also covers 90% of the DCI-P3 color space, that is, it is very well suited for serious graphics work.  Plus, there is HDR400 certification and DolbyVision support.  At the same time, the frames around the displays are still very, very thin, and the front camera from a place that is not the most convenient for users under the screen has moved to where it should be: on the frame above it. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/w-/cq/hw/w-cqhw4xfjpc9d_lxgpc8aodnts.jpeg"><br><br>  An interesting additional feature is the implementation of the technology EyeSafe.  It cuts off the luminescence of the blue spectrum, which has the most negative effect on vision.  This is especially useful for those who are accustomed to a lot and often work at night - their eyes will get tired much less.  Well, in general, the principle of its work, you probably already know about modern smartphones. <br><br>  The second key innovation is completely new processors.  The XPS 13 (7390) uses the latest Intel Ice Lake 10th generation chips, which were also announced during Computex.  If we talk about specific models, the laptop will be equipped with i3-1005 G1, i5-1035 G1 and i7-1065 G7.  The performance increase compared to the previously used Intel 8th generation Y-series chips should be very noticeable.  There are no changes in the number of cores and executable streams, but the architecture has been significantly redesigned.  For example, the width of the executive path and the cache memory are increased, which gives an increase of almost 20% at the level of instructions executed per clock. <br><br>  But more importantly, the brand new Intel Iris Plus graphics core is now integrated into the chips.  Processors have learned to maintain adaptive screen frequency and playfully cope with the reproduction of heavy 4K content.  However, gaming performance has almost doubled.  It is clear that the XPS 13 2 in 1 is not a gaming machine, but still it is one of the indicative metrics. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/wa/a2/ob/waa2obc_vgw15fwlbl3ft6zpzbg.jpeg"><br><br>  However, you need to understand that with such chips without an active cooling system can not do, so she returned safely to the computer.  This led to some weight gain, but the growth is far from dramatic - from 1.24 to 1.32 kg.  So the Dell XPS 13 (7390) is still an extremely compact and portable solution. <br><br>  The computer keyboard is also new - this is already familiar to many users of the proprietary solution of Dell with magnetic levitation.  Only now is the second generation of MagLev buttons.  The touchpad is also new - the panel area has become larger.  The amount of RAM can be 4, 8, 16 or 32 GB, and thanks to the new processors it is faster LPDDR4 with a frequency of 3733 MHz.  Options for different data stores will be three: 256, 512 or 1024 GB. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/yp/6u/cz/yp6uczmtlizbwwjqlm7xsafhs7e.jpeg"><br><br>  The set of interfaces is quite discreet: two USB Type-C with Thunderbolt 3 support, a microSD card reader and a combo audio jack.  The laptop also received a new Killer AX1650 wireless adapter, so the road to a brighter future with Wi-Fi 6 technology for the XPS 13 (9370) is fully open. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#3183c1">Dell XPS 15 (7590)</font> </h2><br>  The second important new feature of Dell for Computex is the new version of our flagship notebook for demanding XPS 15 users. The gadget model index is 7590. The main focus is on a significant increase in computing power.  Now computers are equipped with 9th generation Intel Core processors - i5-9300H, i7-9750H and i9-9980 HK, and the high performance graphics processing is provided by a discrete NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1650 GPU with 4 GB of GDDR5 memory.  The amount of RAM can be 8, 16, 32 or 64 GB, in all cases it is DDR4 with a frequency of 2666 MHz.  There are also four data storage options: these are 256, 512, 1024 or 2048 GB SSDs.  Plus, the same wireless module with Wi-Fi 6 support is integrated here, as well as the new XPS 13 (7390). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/pd/xo/1r/pdxo1rlv1emhfw7oxhfvmulxitq.jpeg"><br><br>  The second key change is three brand new displays.  The most impressive of them is based on the OLED panel with a brightness of 400 nits, 100% DCI-P3 coverage and 4K resolution.  The other two options are IPS panels: touch and glossy with 4K resolution, as well as matte and non-touch with Full HD resolution.  The brightness in both cases reaches 500 nits, the color rendition also does not disappoint.  As a result, users engaged in creative industries are given a very flexible opportunity to choose a portable 15-inch laptop for a very wide variety of different parameters.  By the way, the gadget weighs only 1.8 kilograms. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#3183c1">Alienware M15 and M17 R2</font> </h2><br>  Only recently, we <a href="https://habr.com/ru/company/dell_emc/blog/447872/">told</a> you in detail about the new gaming laptop Alienware M15 and started selling updated versions of it with GeForce RTX graphics in Russia, as the global team brought the second generation of this laptop to Computex 2019: Alienware M15 / M17 R2.  First of all, it is unusual that, externally, computers do not resemble their predecessors at all.  But they are similar to the powerful Alienware Area 51m <a href="https://habr.com/ru/company/dell_emc/blog/436860/">previously presented at CES 2019</a> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/vk/ye/2a/vkye2a2jn4jwmay_n96k2b6aytg.jpeg"><br><br>  The weight of the M15 R2 remained the same - 2.16 kilograms, which can be considered a very moderate value for the gaming latstop.  The size of the body has changed in a smaller direction, but very slightly, so we will not focus on this.  A set of ports remained the same as before, adjusted for more modern versions of some (RJ-45 with a capacity of 2.5 Gb / s, HDMI 2.0b, mini-DisplayPort 1.4).  Headphone and microphone jacks are now separate, before this input was combined.  For gamers with serious gaming headsets, this is a definite plus. <br><br>  Inside now installed processors Intel Core i5-9300H and i9-9980HK 9th generation.  There are several graphics accelerator options: from GeForce GTX 1650 to RTX 2080 Max-Q.  The cooling system has been significantly improved, and the rubber ‚Äúlegs‚Äù on the bottom panel have become taller, which allows the coolers to throw warm air outside more efficiently.  On average, according to Dell internal measurements, the improvement in cooling system efficiency is up to 30%. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/jh/fg/gj/jhfggjkgye0bkivflwk0m0813gs.jpeg"><br><br>  Also in laptops, a new keyboard with a deeper stroke of the buttons: if before the figure was 1.4 mm, now it reaches 1.7 mm.  At the same time, the backlight system has changed: it used to be divided into four zones, and now the glow of the diodes under each of the keys can be adjusted separately. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/g9/u1/7h/g9u17h7cts0ipxsdsn3adhuiy20.jpeg"><br><br>  To the two already familiar screen variants (1080p with a refresh rate of 60 Hz and 1080p with a frequency of 144 Hz) was added another, very luxurious.  Yes, Alienware M15 / 17 R2 will also be equipped with OLED screens, hooray! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/dm/0t/dt/dm0tdt0lgcloq9cmmbt6wi4mw7c.jpeg"><br><br><h2>  <font color="#3183c1">Dell Inspiron 11 (3195), 13 (5390/7390) and 15 (7590)</font> </h2><br>  In addition to our "top" laptops, a wide update was received by the line of more massive Inspiron laptops.  The youngest of the new products - Inspiron 11 (3195) is interesting for its very compact size and is based on the seventh generation AMD A9 processor.  Inside 8 GB of RAM and a 128 GB drive. <br><br>  The next highest is the 13-inch Inspiron 5390, designed for users who are not looking for superpower, but who especially appreciate the design and high level of portability.  The computer case is very light, aluminum trim is used, the frames around the display have become much thinner. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/fk/kc/8q/fkkc8qhp6lcdigjplrr0o-a8hw0.jpeg"><br><br>  At the time of release, the gadget will be equipped with Intel Core 8th generation U-series, but later there will be versions with Intel Core 10th generation Whiskey Lake U inside.  The older versions also use MX150 discrete graphics.  Optionally available options with LTE-modem and a slot for SIM-cards. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/el/iy/dy/eliydy_zbookmsnw-p98rinx6p8.jpeg"><br><br>  The next innovation is the 15-inch Inspiron 7590, which combines moderate size and high performance.  Inside, there are 9th generation Intel Core processors of the H series and GTX 1650 discrete graphics. Engineers paid special attention to the cooling system. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/kd/ts/ui/kdtsuimknvuo0jr0oyetajforhc.jpeg"><br><br>  By the way, this PC has a special version with a reclining back touch screen and a full-size compartment for storing the active pen. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/eu/qf/fb/euqffburm8hkloklnjtvzsspt4i.jpeg"><br><br><h2>  <font color="#3183c1">Dell Inspiron 24 5000 and 27 7000 AIO</font> </h2><br>  Together with laptops on Computex 2019, we showed two brand new candy bars.  Not all of them were available on the stands, but we managed to capture the Inspiron 27 7790 AIO - just look at this handsome man.  He is definitely able to become a real decoration of any modern interior! <br><br>  Actually, the appearance clearly hints at the main scenarios for using both new all-in-one computers: working in office applications, surfing the web, chatting online, watching videos.  Under the game, or, say, installation, they are not "sharpened."  Both computers are equipped with full-HD touchscreen displays with slim frames, pull-out webcams, and powerful sandbags.  Inside the Intel Core i3, i5 and i7 U-series and optional discrete graphics MX150, which makes gadgets quite affordable, and this is certainly very important for home users. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/s7/op/cn/s7opcn9y7qiry82tucyv9grnyyi.jpeg"><br><br><h2>  <font color="#3183c1">Dell Vostro 13 (5390) and 15 (7590)</font> </h2><br>  The line of Dell laptops for everyday use Vostro has also been enriched with two new models.  The 13-inch model has become the lightest and thinnest in the entire history of the series: the thickness is 14.9 mm and the weight is 1.18 kilograms.  By the way, according to the second indicator, the novelty even outpaces the XPS 13 (9380), which we recently <a href="https://habr.com/ru/company/dell_emc/blog/452774/">talked about</a> in <a href="https://habr.com/ru/company/dell_emc/blog/452774/">detail</a> in Habr√©.  I3-8145U, i5-8265U and i7-8565U are used as processors, the older version is supplemented with MX150 discrete graphics. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/8u/ud/mk/8uudmk3oy1oygdcf_shuutqxx4i.jpeg"><br><br>  Well, the new 15-inch Vostro 7590 pleases with a good level of performance, especially in the "top" configuration.  It integrates discrete graphics GTX 1650 and Intel Core i9-9880H. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/jl/kh/hs/jlkhhsxvzg-_zokci18yot_nx6a.jpeg"><br><br><h2>  <font color="#3183c1">When to wait for new items in Russia?</font> </h2><br>  At the end of the material we will try to give maximum information about the timing of the appearance of all the presented devices in Russia.  Gamers are forced to immediately upset - we do not yet have information on the timing of the start of sales of Alienware M15 / M17 R2 in the Russian Federation.  With the rest of the novelties, the situation is much clearer, except that we can not yet disclose the prices - they are at the formative stage.  So, the situation is as follows: <br><br><ul><li>  Dell XPS 13 (7390) will be on sale in Russia at the end of the summer, but inside there will not be Ice Lake processors, but Intel Core U-series of the 8th generation.  The 10th generation of Intel chips will begin to integrate into laptops only towards the end of the year, and in this regard, the situation for all laptop manufacturers is exactly the same. </li><li>  Dell XPS 15 (7590) should arrive on the shelves of domestic stores during July. </li><li>  New Dell Inspiron 11, 13 and 15 in the near future in our market until they appear, the question of the beginning of deliveries to Russia in the process of internal discussion. </li><li>  The new Dell Vostro 13 and 15 should also ship to distributors in July. </li><li>  Monoblocks will have to wait the longest: until the end of August or the beginning of September. </li></ul><br>  This seems to be all.  We have tried to tell about everything that is currently known about the updates to ourselves.  If some of them are of particular interest to you, be sure to write in the comments.  We will study all opinions and first of all we will try in the future to tell in detail on Habr√© exactly those models that you choose.  Thank you for your attention and see you soon! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/454266/">https://habr.com/ru/post/454266/</a></p>
