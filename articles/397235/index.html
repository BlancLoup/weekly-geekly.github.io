They were indicated mysterious "see you the seventh" and the blurred top of the company logo.  Today, Apple <a href="http://www.apple.com/apple-events/september-2016/">will conduct a video broadcast of the</a> event on its website, and on the ‚ÄúHiktaimes‚Äù will be a text translation of the presentation. <br><br>  This is the fifth autumn in a row, during which Apple shows its new products.  By tradition, a good half of the information results in accidental and deliberate leaks.  Therefore, before the presentation, you can easily assemble the appearance of future devices.  It is expected that today will show the new iPhone 7, Apple Watch 2 smart watches and new MacBook laptops.  Inside this post is collected everything that we already know about them. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h1>  Tim Cook </h1><br>  Either at the beginning or at the end of his speech, Tim Cook will tell you how important these five years were for Apple.  August 24, 2011 Cook took over as head of the company.  Five years have passed since then, and it would be strange if Tim had not somehow noted this fact during the presentation.

      <br>
      This is not just a beautiful date, but also a good bonus for the salary ($ 10 million per year) of the executive director.  Cook recently <a href="http://www.macrumors.com/2016/08/24/tim-cook-apple-ceo-five-years/">received</a> 1.26 million Apple shares for a lifetime and good growth rates ‚Äî Apple surpassed two-thirds of the S &amp; P 500 list. The market value of this share volume exceeds $ 100 million.  After that, Cook immediately <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2016/08/29/tim_cook_banks_135m_apple_stock/">sold the</a> shares for $ 36 million to pay taxes.  If Apple‚Äôs performance meets certain conditions, by 2021, Cook will receive 7 million shares of Apple, and it will have about half a billion assets at its disposal. <br><br><h1>  iPhone 7 </h1><br>  Apple likes to provide obvious clues to the design of its invitations.  "See you the seventh" - this is a clear hint of the nail of this evening. <br><br>  Judging by the unconfirmed leaks, the look of the new Apple smartphone differs slightly.  Like the iPhone 6, the new phone will probably be available in two sizes: with a screen diagonal of 4.7 and 5.5 inches. <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/74c/678/362/74c6783624f6437b9daafc910ae7b26e.jpg"></a> <br>  <em><a href="https://www.letemsvetemapplem.eu/2016/08/11/lsa-exkluzivne-detailni-fotografie-iphone-7-a-iphone-7-plus/">One of the sets of photos circulating on the web</a></em> <br><br>  A notable feature is the doublet of cameras on the Plus model.  Each sensor will reportedly have a resolution of 12 megapixels.  One of the cameras will shoot with a wide angle, the other - telephoto.  In the 4.7-inch version of the camera alone, but it is swollen.  The number of flash photodiodes will be increased from two to four: two cold tones, two warm ones.  Perhaps Plus will rise in price for 40 dollars because of cameras. <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d98/062/bd5/d98062bd5c464ef192de3ac0f08a89ce.jpg"></a> <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c88/318/e84/c88318e84e514fef8ce3179cb791eaac.jpg"></a> <br><br>  As usual, photograph leaks are divided into trustworthy and trying to weld on a hype.  Manufacturers of cases and accessories have already worked out the <a href="http://www.racked.com/2014/9/26/7575603/iphone-6-cases">following scheme</a> : they create renderings of unreleased iPhones in their cases.  The graphics are based on assumptions and leaks.  These companies have no additional data.  But so you can catch up with additional traffic of visitors who are interested in "leakage".  After the presentation, manufacturers quickly rework their sites and remove psevdotechki.  This year, for example, <a href="http://www.spigen.com/collections/iphone-7-plus">Spigen</a> , who has already rolled out covers for an unannounced phone, distinguished himself. <br><br>  <strong>New system on chip.</strong>  A10.  <a href="http://www.macrumors.com/2016/09/03/iphone-7-5-colors-ipx7-12mp-cameras/">Production TSMC</a> .  Frequency up to 2.45 GHz, which is much higher than 1.85 GHz of the current A9.  But Apple can reduce the frequency so that the device does not overheat.  The amount of RAM will be 3 GB, but only on Plus.  On a 4.7-inch model, the memory will be 2 GB. <br><br>  <strong>More ROMs.</strong>  Depending on the model, 32, 128 or 256 GB of storage <a href="http://appleinsider.com/articles/16/09/03/apples-iphone-7-to-boast-true-tone-display-upgraded-camera-flash-capacities-of-32-256gb">will be available</a> on the iPhone 7.  At the moment, the cheapest iPhone 6 is available with a storage capacity of 16 GB, ridiculous by the standards of 2016, some of which eat off the operating system. <br><br>  <strong>Goodbye audio jack</strong> .  Probably the most famous change, because it evokes understandable emotions.  Why remove the 3.5-mm audio jack, which for decades has been and remains the standard for headphones?  However, according to reports, new Lightning EarPods headphones and a 3.5 mm Lightning adapter will lie in the phone case.  That is, third-party "ears" will be able to connect. <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f32/451/83c/f3245183cc33484d9efc7159bec8bd13.jpg"></a> <br><br>  <strong>Stereo sound in landscape orientation</strong> . <br><br>  <strong>Battery</strong>  According <a href="">to Lenovo leaks</a> , the iPhone 7 will have a 3000 mAh battery. <br><br>  <strong>New body colors</strong> .  Cosmic gray <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2016/09/03/kgi-iphone-7-to-feature-2-4ghz-a10-chip-ipx7-waterproofing-new-12-megapixel-cameras-piano-black-color-more/">will disappear</a> .  Dark black and piano black will appear.  Rumor has it that the glossy black will be a separate option more expensive. <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/566/e2f/1a0/566e2f1a0bda458d9b4d8237e76c5157.jpg"></a> <br><br>  <strong>The rest</strong> .  Improve the screen color.  New 3D Touch Sensor.  The Home button is no longer a button ‚Äî the touch surface without a click, but with haptic feedback.  Supports Japanese standard FeliCa NFC.  The proximity sensor can become a laser.  IPX7 is water resistant, but it‚Äôs not known how it will be presented to the public.  It is unlikely that users will be offered to swim with the phones.  According to experts, due to water resistance, the reject rate at the assembly stage was higher, which delayed the release date. <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a18/bcf/46d/a18bcf46dff84ebea31f80b96cd99c4e.png"></a> <br>  <em>"Random" leak on the Apple site: see the iPhone 7 compatibility filter. Now fixed.</em> <br><br>  According to rumors, the release of iPhone 7 is scheduled either for 16, or for September 23.  Deliveries have already <a href="http://phoneradar.com/foxconn-ships-370000-apple-iphone-7-7-zhengzhou-britain-netherlands/">begun</a> : on the way to the stores in the USA, Europe and a number of other markets, there are 371,000 units.  And because of the <a href="https://geektimes.ru/post/280042/">explosive success of the Samsung Galaxy Note 7,</a> Apple is <a href="http://www.macrumors.com/2016/09/05/apple-orders-iphone-7-parts-samsung-recall/">forced to increase production</a> . <br><br><h1>  Airplans </h1><br>  Not to be confused with EarPods.  Fully wireless headphones like Bragi Dash, that is, without a connecting cable between the halves.  According to rumors, the work time will be 4 hours, a cover is possible where they can be recharged.  May be included in the iPhone 7, may <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2016/09/06/apples-high-end-wireless-earbuds-may-not-ship-with-iphone-7/">be sold separately</a> .  The communication standard is Bluetooth or <a href="http://www.macrumors.com/2016/09/06/apple-bluetooth-earbud-plans/">something custom</a> .  Hopefully, they will work, including outside the apple ecosystem. <br><br> <a href="https://habrastorage.org/files/4e0/65b/a02/4e065ba02f9d44cd8d41d85af94ff4f5"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/4e0/65b/a02/4e065ba02f9d44cd8d41d85af94ff4f5"></a> <br><br><h1>  Apple Watch 2 </h1><br>  Almost a year and a half has passed since the release of the original Apple Watch.  According to rumors, the second version is not much different in appearance.  Most of the changes <a href="http://www.macrumors.com/2016/09/02/what-to-expect-from-apples-september-7-event/">concern the</a> stuffing: a more powerful processor, a more capacious battery, a barometer and satellite navigation will appear.  According to the leaks, in a 42 mm model, the battery will hold 35% more charge, which should compensate for the appearance of GPS. <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d94/03b/cf8/d9403bcf8f3749748fdcec46995e703a.jpg"></a> <br><br><h1>  Soft and stuff </h1><br>  iOS 10, macOS Sierra, tvOS 10 and watchOS 3 have been tested since June, when they were presented to the WWDC as beta versions.  Today we can be pleased with the dates of their official release. <br><br>  In the coming weeks, the AppStore <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/09/01/apple-is-going-to-remove-abandoned-apps-from-the-app-store/">will be cleaned</a> of old software that is no longer supported by its creators. <br><br>  And Apple has finally activated <a href="https://twitter.com/Apple">its Twitter account</a> , which the company has had since 2011.  Instead of the standard egg, a juicer appeared, but the account seemed to be empty.  That's just some kind of magic in the microblog has a phantom tweet.  For some reason, it is not shown from the account page. <br><br><div class="oembed"><twitter-widget class="twitter-tweet twitter-tweet-rendered" id="twitter-widget-0" style="position: absolute; visibility: hidden; display: block; transform: rotate(0deg); width: 500px; margin: 10px auto; max-width: 100%; min-width: 220px;"></twitter-widget><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" align="center" data-twitter-extracted-i1551427372560658576="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">  September 7 at 10 am PT <br>  Watch the event on <a href="https://t.co/yLa2e4Xr2R">https://t.co/yLa2e4Xr2R</a> . <br>  RT for a reminder on event day.  <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/AppleEvent%3Fsrc%3Dhash">#AppleEvent</a> <a href="https://t.co/e9MHNkLeoi">pic.twitter.com/e9MHNkLeoi</a> </p>  - Apple (@Apple) <a href="https://twitter.com/Apple/status/771787818095874048">September 2, 2016</a> </blockquote><script async="" src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div><br><h1>  Questionable </h1><br>  It is unknown whether the fast-aging MacBook lineup will be updated today.  Today, Apple continues to seriously sell computers that came out four years ago.  Speech about MacBook Pro without Retina screen - the laptop was released in June 2012.  Now almost all Apple computers in the MacRumors Buyer's Guide are worth ‚Äúnot buying‚Äù red. <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/8d8/0a1/605/8d80a160511047e89c747186842f7756.png"></a> <br><br>  If new mabuki happens, they will surely have a colorful OLED strip instead of function keys, Kaby Lake microarchitecture processors and other stuffing updates.  However, rumors say that new Apple laptops will be released no earlier than October. <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/88d/1f5/ff2/88d1f5ff22834059b47c23825ce3bd85.jpg"></a> <br><br>  And, of course, today will not show the new iPad.  No, the support of two SIM-cards in the iPhone 7 is unlikely. <br><br><h1>  Where to watch live streaming </h1><br>  Of course, all of the above are expert assumptions, photos from factories in China, and sometimes frankly unreliable rumors.  But wait for accurate information is not long. <br><br>  The presentation will traditionally be broadcast on the Internet.  On the page <a href="http://www.apple.com/apple-events/september-2016/">www.apple.com/apple-events/september-2016/</a> video does not work in every browser.  In the list of supported: Safari on iOS 7.0 and later, Safari 6.0.5 on OS X 10.8.5 or higher, Apple TV of the second or third generation with update 6.2 or AppleTV of the fourth generation, and Microsoft Edge on Windows 10. The problem is purely technical - need support for HTTP Live Streaming (HLS). <br><br>  The beginning of the video broadcast is 10 am local time or at <strong>20:00 Moscow time</strong> .  Follow the <strong>text broadcast on Hiktaims</strong> , which will start one hour before. <br><br><hr><br>  Also today there will be another event not related to Apple - the presentation of Sony.  It is expected that at <strong>22:00 Moscow time, the</strong> Japanese company will show the PlayStation Neo, its updated game console with iron more powerful, the slim version of the PlayStation 4 and remind you of the PlayStation VR virtual reality helmet.  Text translation will begin one hour before this event. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/397235/">https://habr.com/ru/post/397235/</a></p>
