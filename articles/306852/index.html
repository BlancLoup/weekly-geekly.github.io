      There were quite a few people who wanted to improve their information security skills - today we will summarize the results of the qualifying round and share some interesting statistics. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h4>  Figures and results </h4><br>  A total of 952 were registered from those wishing to participate in the internship.  By the way, the platform we use for conducting webinars has a limit of 1000 participants - so we did not reach the top level a bit. <br><br>  For the selection of participants in the summer practice, we have compiled a special <a href="http://goo.gl/forms/nkmJgSotueeN2SR32">questionnaire</a> designed to check the level of knowledge of applicants.  Here is how the results of the participants who answered the questions were distributed: <br><br><ul><li>  Only 2 people answered all the questions correctly. </li><li>  Only 13 people answered all the questions incorrectly. </li><li>  The remaining participants are divided - about half know the correct answers to more than 5 questions, half - to less than 5. </li></ul><br>  Initially, the questionnaire was conceived as a tool to reduce the number of participants below the technical threshold of 1,000 people (suddenly there would be more people willing).  Therefore, we wrote in the announcement that we could not accept everyone.  But since in the end the technical ability to do this appeared, then all those who participated in the survey will be allowed to participate in the internship. <br><br><h4>  Little about the questionnaire </h4><br>  I would also like to dwell a bit on the questionnaire itself - its format has caused a storm of emotions among the audience.  Someone thought it too simple, to whom it seemed, on the contrary, too difficult for people who are not aware of information security.  For those who were not impressed by the level of complexity of the questions, we want to emphasize once again that our course is devoted to the basics of information security.  Therefore, more experienced specialists are unlikely to find in it something new, although they will receive, if necessary, the opportunity to systematize their knowledge of application security. <br><br>  The second task of the questionnaire, in addition to bringing the number of students to a technically acceptable number, was their preparation for work in the training mode - we want the participants to practice full dedication.  The ‚Äúfan‚Äù mode with listening to a webinar in one window and watching videos with cats in another is not something for which we would like to waste our and your time. <br><br>  That's all, see you on an internship!  A more detailed announcement of the program and materials for training will be sent to all registered by email during this week. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/306852/">https://habr.com/ru/post/306852/</a></p>
