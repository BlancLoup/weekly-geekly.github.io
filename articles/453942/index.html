And probably, the beginning of the article does not quite fit the title.  Who is a good leader? <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  I will argue from the point of view of the project manager, but being the administrative head for the current moment is no less than the project head - I see no significant differences with a few exceptions. <br><br>  So, it is necessary:

    <ul><li>  To be able to build a plan and follow the goal, adapting to the circumstances, and sometimes creating them; </li><li>  Set adequate tasks and monitor their implementation; </li><li>  Build human relationships in the team; </li><li>  Be ethical. </li></ul><br>  Why is there nothing about management efficiency?  Well, probably because not all pastries are equally useful, <abbr title="One of the characters in the book of T. Demarco is Deadline, a novel about project management, which was distinguished by applying the principles of effective management.">Mr. Bellok</abbr> .  For each case, the effective management will be different, you should not do everything according to one scheme. <br><br>  Can all managers be good and right?  In the current realities - definitely not. <br><br>  About each of the marked points written many books.  About the first three - obviously more than about the fourth. <br><br>  The first three are constantly remembered at trainings and refresher courses.  The first two are for absolutely everyone.  The third one is especially popular at events related to agility (yes, not flexibility, for several reasons I write here) and among HR specialists. <br><br>  But the fourth is often forgotten.  It is important not only for the leader, but the more a person rises higher, the more important it becomes.  And not only forget, but also neglect. <br><br>  Sometimes, ethics is forgotten in books, in training.  And even in life.  And the last - the most offensive. <br><br>  Manipulating facts, distorting data, intolerance towards others or neglecting their interests are the reasons why I want to remind everyone about ethics and professional responsibility using the example of the Project Management Institute code.  Remind, in places to clarify or even give examples from life. <br><br>  <b>It is important.</b> <br><br>  And for a start - a fact that is a discovery for many: <br><br>  <i>Entering into professional associations, associations, institutes, passing certification, often you not only receive dividends from this, but also impose obligations and restrictions on yourself.</i> <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">About PMI Ethics</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  Somewhere, these obligations and restrictions are fairly formal.  Somewhere with them is very strict.  I want to believe that in PMI - strictly.  It is not for nothing that they have a <a href="https://www.pmi.org/about/ethics/code">code</a> , a decision-making model, and even an <a href="https://www.pmi.org/about/ethics/complaints">ethics committee</a> .  I have not yet had the opportunity to check, but I want to believe it. <br><br>  Responsibility for non-compliance includes various penalties, including deprivation of membership (of course, not free) and revocation of certificates received (which, in addition to the exam, cost even more money than membership).  Why do I mention money?  Because for many it is the only method of evaluation. <br><br>  The code of ethics and professional responsibility of PMI extends to: <br><br><ul><li>  members of the Institute; </li><li>  certified by the Institute specialists; </li><li>  applicants for certification; </li><li>  Institute volunteers. </li></ul></div></div><br>  What ethical and professional values ‚Äã‚Äãare mentioned in the document?  According to the results of the evaluation by the community and experts, 4 basic values ‚Äã‚Äãwere selected in the code: <br><br><ul><li>  a responsibility; </li><li>  respect; </li><li>  justice; </li><li>  honesty. </li></ul><br>  Next, I will focus on each value and give comments on the principles of this code in the order in which they are listed.  Somewhere I will try to give examples based on my life and my experience (and yes, it may not be relevant). <br><br>  PS The code of ethics is divided into ‚Äú <i>desirable</i> ‚Äù and ‚Äú <b>mandatory</b> ‚Äù principles.  I do not share. <br><br><h2>  A responsibility </h2><br>  As part of the definition of the term, the document refers to the recognition of its own decisions, taken or not (sic! You should also answer for this!), Taken and unaccepted actions and consequences. <br><br>  For a start, an important remark, why it is also said about the lack of action.  Delaying or refusing to make a decision or take an action often costs the company (project) more expensive than the actions taken, even if they are not correct.  And if it is absolutely simpler, only the one who does nothing is not mistaken. <br><br>  At a certain point in my life, words about inaction became very important to me.  And for me this moment concerned the escalation of problems to levels higher.  How many times I have faced inaction - I do not want to count.  What most often flowed from this?  Conflict or recycling.  By the way, not paid. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Principles of Responsibility</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><blockquote>  We make decisions and take actions based on the interests of society, public safety and the environment. </blockquote><br>  An interesting and global point, which is difficult to formulate or understand without participating in global (albeit to a small extent) projects or tasks.  And then I had to think for a long time about an example that would not be related to something global.  And the fact that reminded me of simple examples was the registration in the online store. <br><br>  Creating a website or an online store, we take responsibility for the safety of society in the face of our visitors or customers who share their data.  And we are obliged to include in the solution functions for data protection and their removal. But in general, the example of a nuclear power plant and waste discharged into a river looks like a more intelligible example, yes? <br>  Therefore, when making decisions, we must take into account all possible nuances of the people around us and the world. <br><blockquote>  We only accept tasks that match our conditions, experience, skills and qualifications. </blockquote><br>  The point that lovers will not appreciate the career of a career, not bringing matters to the end.  And he is quite self-critical and at the same time wise.  And you need to do it wisely.  He does not say that you do not need to develop.  However, he very clearly fixes one of the important principles - I am sure that you will not do it - do not begin.  And also, if conditions do not suit you - do not give people false hopes in wanting to receive bonuses later. <br><br>  And all this together is important, and from any side.  By agreeing to do what we do not know and do not know, and sometimes we don‚Äôt understand how to learn, we spend resources and do not perform tasks. <br><br>  And I have a completely applied example.  People (many) do not know how to formulate MS Excel, MS Word forms, or just fill in a PDF.  The task, you nod.  And then they bring the information calculated on the knee.  A broken Word file with floated formatting, or even a scan of a file filled in by hand. <br><br>  This is especially cool when changing the initial data in such an Excel or a small misprint - all the work has to be done from scratch. <br><br>  On average, in my experience - out of 5 people only one speaks of the problem with the task.  The rest do as they can, silently, often with rework (especially when there are many pages in such documents, and the result is needed quickly). <br><br>  Another good example of such a work is a protected table with formulas, in which you need to enter nothing but your data.  And you send it copied, with dead formulas and filled (and counted) by hand.  Well, or quite cool option - a photo of a hand-filled table. <br><br>  Give yourself examples where problems arise on more important tasks and are silent about them. <br><blockquote>  We fulfill our commitments - we do what we promised. </blockquote><br>  Probably everyone had to deal with the fact that people do not finish something to the end.  I‚Äôm not talking about ‚ÄúGold plating‚Äù, I‚Äôm talking about meeting the requirements that have been set for them.  When they give you crap, which is impossible to use.  At some point, you spit and take what they give.  And you do it yourself.  Time is more expensive. <br><br>  I had a situation where I spent much more time on instructions than people did later on acting on it - and in the end I did everything myself.  Because ‚Äúwhy should we read?‚Äù. <br><br>  So, ethical experts do not do that.  The work is done as discussed, in accordance with the rules and requirements of the client.  And in the end it saves time for everyone. <br><blockquote>  If we make mistakes or make omissions, we admit our guilt and immediately make corrections.  If we find errors or omissions made by others, we report these errors and omissions on the fact of their detection to relevant persons.  We take responsibility for the consequences of our mistakes and omissions. </blockquote><br>  I must say that this principle, like many in the code, is connected with others.  And sometimes it can be said that this is the same thing - but in other words. <br><br>  I think everybody had ‚Äúscapegoats‚Äù in their path, who have everyone to blame except for them.  And this is not professional. <br><br>  Yes, it is often expensive to be a professional and even unprofitable.  But we get a reputation and this is reflected in the future.  As on the client - who gets the desired result, and on us. <br><br>  Yes, you can sometimes discuss compensation for fixing the problem.  But only in the situation when it is not your fault.  If it‚Äôs not at all obvious, or if it‚Äôs the client‚Äôs fault, you are in your own right.  But if this is your mistake, you should not even try. <br><br>  Only those who do nothing and do not communicate with anyone are insured against mistakes and omissions.  Therefore, it is important for any professional to be able to recognize and respond to the consequences.  In fact, this is one of the reasons for the high prices for the services of the best specialists and companies.  They understand that nobody is perfect - either they take into account all possible situations, or they put risks.  And that is why they have a line, they can afford to choose a client and refuse a number of tasks - those that do not have specifics. <br><blockquote>  We keep private and confidential information entrusted to us. </blockquote><br>  Comments or the walls in my opinion. <br><blockquote>  We comply with this Code and are responsible for complying with its provisions. </blockquote><br>  As I already wrote, many elements are connected here.  And they serve to simplify the understanding and guaranteed information to the signatories.  And this clause reminds us that we sign it, observe and bear responsibility for the observance of the Code by others.  And I think this is important, even if someone considers it ‚Äúsquealing‚Äù or a desire to go into their own business. <br><br>  How many times have you come across what you didn't think was right?  Have you ever been away from the topic, at some point, so as not to waste your energy?  And how many times in the end did the consequences arrive to you and did you get thoughts of the format ‚ÄúYour, how it happened and what to do now?‚Äù.  I've had it happen.  After that, I felt ashamed for a long time.  And now I try to prevent such things. <br><blockquote>  We know and follow the principles, rules, norms and laws governing our work, professional and voluntary activities. </blockquote><br>  It is foolish to deny the need for this item.  First of all, because its violation usually leads to significant consequences, especially if such a violation is opened.  Secondly, sometimes because of ignorance of something in the beginning, we have to redo everything in the middle or the end.  This is especially nice when, not having studied the standard at the beginning, at the end of the work we are confronted with a ‚Äúsudden‚Äù law from three years ago. <br><br>  Well, if this is not a law, then it‚Äôs probably everyone who violated a certain rule or rule of a single team.  Sometimes - this is a trifle, which does not affect the result.  And sometimes, a forgotten question or comment from one of the customer‚Äôs ordinary employees threatens annual work. <br><br>  Yes, this can be attributed to stakeholder engagement, but it is not only that.  I often came across the fact that ignorance of the unspoken rules was not enough for a very strong economy on the project. <br><br>  And yes, I myself - often differ in that I can not say once again something that I consider everyone understandable and well-known.  As you know, it almost never happens. <br><blockquote>  We report unethical or illegal behavior to the appropriate authority and, if necessary, to those affected by such behavior. </blockquote><br>  Perhaps this item may be the most unloved or imperceptible in the territory of the former Soviet Union.  In our country, this is considered primarily squealing.  However, from the point of view of professionalism, this is a warning and correct work with risks. <br><br>  After all, any illegal action has its consequences, and every such consequence is a risk.  The risk of missed deadlines, loss of money or even the loss of the project. <br><br>  We can unknowingly become a victim of ignorance or a hostage to the situation.  People can get an illegal decision - simply because the underlying product on the basis of which the decision is made does not belong to the developer.  And further it entails a whole chain of reactions if you sell the results obtained with the help of an illegal product or solution. <br><br>  I have come across unethical behavior more than once, and for the most part, people (including those of government) don‚Äôt care.  And sometimes they approve of getting the result at any cost. <br><br>  I did not come across illegal actions. </div></div><br><h2>  Respect </h2><br>  Probably something that is not always enough in a large organization, when every person is easily replaceable.  According to the definition from the code - it is the need to take care of yourself, others and resources.  Moreover, resources are understood to mean everything that in one way or another concerns you, from the project personnel and property to the company's reputation and natural resources. <br><br>  And I see that here you can find a certain similarity with the principles of Agile. <br><br>  Respectful environment helps to create a trusted environment, confidence in the future, high performance and an atmosphere of cooperation. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Principles of respect</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><blockquote>  We get information about the norms and customs of others and avoid behaviors that may be considered disrespectful. </blockquote><br>  And I would say that here we see the intersection with the previous section, however, here it looks a little wider.  Since we are talking primarily about large projects, which are most often implemented by an international team, here we add to the professional and industry standards also the national characteristics of each of the participants. <br><br>  Often, what is a norm of behavior for us, for people living in a neighboring country, and sometimes a city - the same action can be an insult, even blood feud. <br><br>  Yes, now it is actively smoothed at the state level, arguing that we live in a multicultural society and we must treat other people's blunders from the point of view of our perception more loyally if we see that a person is from outside or from another faith, culture or just environment.  However, as professionals, we should not only be more loyal, but also try to exclude such factors from work.  And if allowed - then take measures to resolve. <br><br>  For example, if we see that an action is unpleasant for a representative of another nationality in a team, then we can ask colleagues to stop behaving this way.  Also, how can we ask male colleagues to stop making jokes about girls.  Well, at least in their presence. <br><blockquote>  We listen to the point of view of others and try to understand it. </blockquote><br>  How often do you encounter the fact that a colleague decided to act in a certain way and does not listen to objections?  And how often does your leader, having borrowed an idea-fix, go to her like a bull to a red rag?  I come across this with a certain periodicity.  Yes, there are times when it is not critical.  And there are - when it leads us into the abyss.  At this moment it is important to remember that our opinion is not always the only correct one. <br><br>  And often such ideas lead to conflict.  And any conflict in the team badly affects the state of the team and performance. <br><blockquote>  We interact directly with those people with whom we are in conflict or with whose opinions we do not agree. </blockquote><br>  In order to explain this point, I would like to turn to conflict management and methods of conflict resolution. <br><br>  And the best solution is to work together.  Why is it important?  Firstly, in this way we do not break the connection, because often people stop communicating after a conflict and this leads to loss of communication in the team.  Secondly, often, when everyone defends his point of view, both are a little mistaken.  A bit - because I often see that the solutions proposed by the parties are similar.  Simply - not to the end.  And everyone sees in a separate trifle an excuse for abuse and discussion, that "here he has everything completely failed."  And when working together, they will see the problems of each other, realizing that otherwise they agree.  And most likely they will find the perfect or closest solution.  And yes, teamwork brings together.  You did not notice that conflicts often have enough productive team members, and not the leader and joon, for example?  Thanks to teamwork, people restore communications, and sometimes they simply create them, instead of creating a negative for the rest of the time. <br><br>  Another solution is a compromise.  It is worse than the collaboration.  It is worse, because here usually every member of the conflict loses something.  And it hurts him.  Yes, the conflict is closed, but communications will become complicated. <br><blockquote>  We behave professionally, even if it‚Äôs not mutual </blockquote><br>  Actually, from my point of view here, too, it is not worth splashing on a great comment.  It is important to remain a professional, even if you are rude, rude, demanding to do something illegal.  We do the work qualitatively and correctly, even if, on the other hand, they spit on it. <br><blockquote>  We are in good faith negotiation </blockquote><br>  We do not distort the facts, do not present information from the angle we need.  When we communicate with a client who does not always understand the whole idea (and yes, this is very often), then we have to explain everything honestly and openly to him, without creating additional costs and volumes. <br><br>  And here it is worth noting an interesting fact.  Being deceived, people then do not want to believe in the truth and themselves go on to those who have deceived them.  Maybe you just do not want to admit? <br><blockquote>  We do not use our knowledge or position to influence decision-making or taking actions against others for personal gain. </blockquote><br>  In addition to honesty and openness on our part, we also prioritize the needs and interests of our client (customer). <br><br>  If you can solve a client‚Äôs problem with minimal costs, but the department (firm) is idle, then you shouldn‚Äôt pick up the price and offer a scope of work that isn‚Äôt necessary as a mandatory one.  However, you can well explain that there are options for how to achieve more and offer the services of colleagues.  Anyway, if that helps. <br><br>  If you have an impact on people, then do not use it to your advantage.  I think for many it can be a difficult ordeal. <br><blockquote>  We are not abusive towards others. </blockquote><br>  You can count this next repetition.  In fact, this is a more strict point than the points described earlier about norms, behavior and point of view.  And yes, somewhere it is.  But the document is written as intelligibly as possible for everyone to minimize the dual interpretation. <br><blockquote>  We respect the property rights of others. </blockquote><br>  Returning to the paragraph on the legality of action.  Violating copyrights or using other people's things without permission is all a violation of the right to property.  And the law. <br><br>  If we do not respect property rights, then this may result in a risk or conflict for us.  Not a fact, but still.  Or maybe by court.  And also - we will look weaker when we try to protect our rights by violating others. <br><br>  And we do not want to be weak. </div></div><br><h2>  Justice </h2><br>  Everyone perceives justice in his own way.  But from the point of view of the document in question, it is our duty to act correctly, without lobbying someone‚Äôs interests.  And yet - without trying to prove that we are the coolest and best here. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Principles of Justice</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><blockquote>  We demonstrate transparency in decision making. </blockquote><br>  People are such interesting characters who constantly think that there is some kind of conspiracy, or that they are underestimated.  The more decisions you make without giving reasons to others, the more often you are considered a tyrant or a despot.  This does not mean that it is necessary to discuss your decision with others (although it can be useful), but it means that you need to explain it and communicate it to others around you openly. <br><br>  It is beneficial to convey the whole chain of reasoning when making a decision, because thanks to this we perceive the information more similarly.  This shows your unity with the team and helps the team to behave correctly, understanding the task itself better, motivating it to do the right thing. <br><br>  And yet - it just removes many questions from each separately. <br><blockquote>  We continually test our impartiality and objectivity by taking appropriate corrective actions. </blockquote><br>  Even the most honest and correct person has moments of turbidity.  We can simply not think, but we can get into a difficult situation when we do not see a choice.  And at this moment it is important to make the right decision.  Yes, not the fact that it will be useful for us.  But let it be sure to be useful for business. <br><br>  And also a little life hacking.  What you may consider an intractable problem may not be a problem for your manager, director, or client.  Therefore, it is sometimes useful just to talk humanly and openly. <br><br>  Perhaps that is why I rarely hide my problems.  But I do not throw them out until they ask. <br><blockquote>  We provide equal access to information to those who are allowed access. </blockquote><br>  On large projects, a situation often arises when the right hand does not know what the left hand is doing.  Or that only a small part of the team is aware of any changes.  And this can often cause serious consequences. <br><br>  And sometimes - it happens deliberately to substitute someone.  But we already know the point about personal interests? <br><br>  Similarly, we operate in the framework of procurement.  And this is a big point for us.  If among my readers there is someone who is actively working with government procurement or procurement for 223-FZ, who did not come across documents, where a reserve was clearly made for someone, or where there is no streamlined and ambiguous interpretation - write a comment about it.  It will be interesting to know in which area it works like this.  But only if you are actively engaged in this, and not participated in one or two competitions. <br><br><blockquote>  We make opportunities equally accessible to qualified candidates. </blockquote><br>  The choice of a specialist, contractor, partner.  We provide all candidates equal access to information and do not give anyone any benefits.  This is useful for the market - in terms of competition.  This is also useful for you - you will get better results for less resources.  The main thing is that these candidates also think the same.  And then they go in jambs ‚Äî I don‚Äôt know, I don‚Äôt know how, but everything is ready. <br><blockquote>  We inform the relevant parties in advance of the occurrence of a conflict of interest - real or potential </blockquote><br>  In fact, a conflict of interest is not only accepted a friend or girl for a job, or giving an order to an uncle without a competition.  Sometimes it is such a trifle as choosing a platform or subd.  For example, you have heard about the new subd and feedback from your familiar freelancers is very cool.  And you want to try, but to try at home is boring, especially since no one there will tell.  But at work, with the team - what is not a test? <br><br>  Only at this moment, you are not quite correctly prioritizing and assessing the risks. <br>  Or - all your life you have dreamed of building an office (I remembered one here ... a farm.).  And you have the opportunity to influence the decision of the company - an office or a new shop.  However, would you be sober to evaluate all the factors? <br><br>  The edge is thin and you should not look for a catch everywhere - you need to develop, learn new things.  But it is important to correctly assess the risks. <br><blockquote>  If it turns out that we are dealing with a real or potential conflict of interest, we refrain from interfering in the decision-making process or influencing the outcome in any other way until: we have not fully informed the project participants whose interests have been hurt;  we did not approve the harm reduction plan and did not get the agreement of the project participants to take action </blockquote><br>  The problem that people know about and for which a number of planned measures are taken to solve, will entail less consequences than if we try to solve the problem nahrapa or secretly from others.  And it may unexpectedly emerge for others.  Why is the consent of others important?  Because they may have information other than ours, which may affect the decisions made. <br><blockquote>  We do not hire and do not dismiss, do not encourage or punish employees, and do not conclude or reject contracts based on personal considerations, including, among other things, favoritism, nepotism and bribery </blockquote><br>  There are important intersections with past points and another point that requires attention.  Doing any of these actions - you risk.  However, in addition to the risk of violation of the law or the rules of the company, as well as the code of ethics - your risk of losing quality increases significantly. <br>  Firstly, it is not a fact that people are competent, having received a job or an order based on cronyism or bribes. <br><br>  And secondly, you get a risk and close the work on the same principle.  No, it is, of course, good, for your wallet or ChSV, probably.  But for the client, the project and the benefits - this is sad. <br><blockquote>  We do not accept discrimination, including discrimination based on gender, race, age, religion, disability, nationality, or sexual orientation </blockquote><br>  Not my favorite item.  Mind in general, I agree that this is correct.  But sometimes it's hard to agree with it in the depths of the soul.  True, it does not bother me at work - to comply fully.  In life - sometimes there are problems. <br><br>  How many times have I seen refusals from cool ideas, because they were suggested by the ‚Äústarper‚Äù or vice versa - a beginner.  True, despite the fact that I saw it more than once - I do not consider my experience extensive.          ,   ,   . <br>           ,       . <br><br><blockquote>     (, PMI,  ),       </blockquote><br>          ,   ,        . </div></div><br><h2><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> Honesty </font></font></h2><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In the original, it sounds like ‚ÄúHonesty‚Äù. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And I'm not quite sure that the term in translation to the end conveys the essence and meaning. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">By definition, it is our duty to determine the truth and to act sincerely, as for communication and behavior.</font></font><br><br><div class="spoiler"> <b class="spoiler_title"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Principles of honesty</font></font></b> <div class="spoiler_text"><blockquote>      </blockquote><br>  ,   ,      ,    .  ,     ,  ,     . -    ,  -    ,   . <br><br>         ,    .          . <br><blockquote>       </blockquote><br>  ,    . <br><br> ,      ,         .    .    ‚Äî   ,         .         ,   ,    . <br><br>   ,   ,     ,     ,         .     . <br><br>   ,        . <br><blockquote>      </blockquote><br>  ,        ,    . <br><br>     ,  ,     .      ,          ? ,   ,          ,       ‚Äî     . <br><blockquote>         ,    </blockquote><br> ‚Äú‚Äù  ‚Äú‚Äù  .  . <br><br> ,     ‚Äî    .          ‚Äî  . ,      .    ‚Äî     ,    ,  ,  . <br><br>    ?    ,      ‚Äî     ,     ,        . <br><blockquote>    ,   ,  ,      </blockquote><br>         ,     ‚Äî     .     ‚Äî   ,   .   ‚Äî  ,   . ,     ,   ,        .   . <br><br>  ‚Äî      ?   ‚Äî . <br><br>  ,       .         ,    . <br><br>            .  ,       .    ,    ,         . <br><br> ‚Äî      ? <br> ‚Äî   ,   . <br> ‚Äî   ,    . <br> ,      .        . <br><blockquote>       ,    . , ,       ,   ‚Äú‚Äù,       , ,  , ,            </blockquote><br>          .  ,    ,  ,   ,     ,  .       . <br><br>    ,             ,  . <br><br> ,      ‚Äú-‚Äù,        .       ‚Äú ‚Ññ#@$,   !‚Äù.      ?   ‚Äî          ,    . <br><blockquote>     ,          </blockquote><br> ,              500 $,    ,          1 500 $.   ‚Äî     .        ‚Äî     ,   .     . <br><br>   ,      ,       . <br>  ,   ‚Äî         . ,       . </div></div><br><h2>  Conclusion </h2><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The code of ethics ends there. But this does not mean that it is limited to what is written. To paint the subtleties of ethical behavior need, probably, a whole series of books. And for some people, application examples will also be needed, moreover, from their industry and with details. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">This code appeared at the Institute in 2006. But work in this direction began in 1981, and in the late 1980s the first PMP code was formulated. Does this code work and execute well? It is difficult to say, since I did not intersect with the people who accepted it for work. I suspect that is not perfect - but it works. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Why did I decide to write about it? He is close to me in spirit and does not cause rejection. Yes, I can not boast that I follow him perfectly, but I follow him.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Did I have to sacrifice the principles described in my life? </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Alas, but yes. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Yes, without pleasure and by direct instructions. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And it was before I learned about the code. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">But I have already said that he is close to me in spirit, which is why I admit that I stumbled. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Will I convince readers to follow him? </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I have no such right. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Would I recommend people to live like this? </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Definitely yes. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And also, I will be glad if the number of people who accepted it increases. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Perhaps the world will be a little better. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">PS </font></font><i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">True, we do not like to read. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Especially those things where just put a tick of consent.</font></font></i> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/453942/">https://habr.com/ru/post/453942/</a></p>
