Exactly at 10 o'clock local time, Californian time, the current head of Apple, Tim Cook, appeared on the scene, and, accordingly, began the presentation.  But now it‚Äôs not about the presentation itself, but about the moral state of the public on the occasion of its beginning. <br><br>  Every year more and more iPhones are sold, in parallel with the growth in sales, the number of fans of the model and the brand as a whole is increasing.

      What I am leading to, and the fact that this very time of waiting for a new model for consumers has become a real torture.  Moreover, this torture was constantly fueled by some rumors about the specifications of the new generation iPhone. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Already in June, the public was warm enough for the announcement, while many people watched the broadcast from the WWDC, but (an important point), sites such as Engadget did not fall.  Then Steve Jobs stood on the stage and ... He didn‚Äôt show the new smartphone, thereby cutting off the cherished tradition of the last four years, in the annual update of the device in the same place and at the same time, I‚Äôll emphasize the time. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/840410d1/620d2347/e354f3fa/f6859dca.jpg"><br><br>  The fans then, I remember, were upset, but the main audience was satisfied (they announced iOS 5 after all).  And it is precisely the time of this presentation that can be called the time of the beginning of an even more terrible torture. <br><br>  After all, if we argue from the point of view of sound logic, the absence of the announcement of the iPhone 5 at the WWDC conference meant that the device was being made so innovative and ‚Äúsuper mega fucking‚Äù that it had to move its announcement.  Especially if these arguments were supported by rumors about a radically new design, a new screen, etc. <br><br>  That is, for the time from June to September, the public was being heated up so intensively and at such rates.  That the real boiling point was the announcement of the presentation date.  It was a blast.  ‚ÄúHere it is the date, the day when Apple finally makes everyone and everything!‚Äù Thought millions of people with me as well. <br><br>  This expectation of the new iPhone has never been.  Broadcast has become a real apogee.  I will never forget the moment of the beginning - when sites fell down one by one.  All Russian repeaters like iPhones.ru were from the influx of visitors.  This, I emphasize, has never been, so that everything would be killed in turn.  I could not believe my eyes when Engadget fell. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/d0561f7a/3fbb2c1f/64c2e5b5/62a997c8.jpg"><br><br>  Created a truly madness, the madness that made Apple, and, not a penny spent on it.  The whole world is waiting for the new iPhone.  There can be no better moment than now for the presentation of the five. <br><br>  ‚ÄúIPhone 4s - what?‚Äù, - short (without a mat), the reaction of all who watched.  Watch the presentation video, it shows the reaction of the hall to what is happening.  I will repeat the situation, the presentation was watched by people who have never done anything like this.  These are consumers, not fans.  So, right after the announcement, the chats froze.  No one could believe their eyes.  A person standing on the last rung of ‚Äúhappiness,‚Äù in front of euphoria, suddenly realizes that euphoria is being carried over for a year ... <br><br>  And it was the greatest disappointment of at least a year.  I can‚Äôt call disappointment a decade, because I don‚Äôt know the whole history of zero. <br>  I want to assume that the next iPhone announcement will not be able to reach such heights of universal attention.  First of all, because everyone was waiting for him yesterday, and they were exactly in the ‚Äúnecessary condition‚Äù. <br><br>  This situation reminds me of the launch of the game Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2, the passions among gamers was huge, and the sales were justified, but it was cool to release Black Ops, just like MW3 does not bother with the attention of its predecessor. <br><br>  Undoubtedly, sales of Apple iPhone 4s will be colossal, record, well, or whatever, they write to Apple.  For Tim Cook, this is not a good start for the head of the company.  After all, I have already heard somewhere, they say, Apple is not the same ... </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/129835/">https://habr.com/ru/post/129835/</a></p>
