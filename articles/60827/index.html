  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Antivirus box boom: before and after</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Hardly anyone remembers - once there was no retail.  What idiot during the heyday of Gorbushka and Mitino with disks ‚Äúall software for a hundred rubles‚Äù could have occurred to me to buy a licensed box for a thousand.  It took some 3-4 years, and today the box software is interesting to all - vendors, partners, the press.  How to sell it, where, where to put it on the shelf, how to enter this market.  Lexicon was enriched with new terminology - "pallets", "visual communications", "throughput, I'm sorry, of the store." <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/50b/08a/537/50b08a5375abe9d02dd9a57dbe23635c.png" width="239" height="170" alt="121.48 KB"><br><br><a name="habracut"></a>  How did box retail appear?  Somehow suddenly.  And then one day we realized that about a third of all antiviruses currently sold in stores are our boxes.  People often ask what you did to become antivirus number two in retail.  I am ashamed to say - did not do anything.  While other companies have already spent thousands of dollars on advertising in federal networks, we thought about something else entirely.  In particular, about high. <br><br>  Certainly, the basic idea was that the antivirus was not a package of milk, and not a loaf of bread.  At a time when the antivirus has not yet become a mass product, the decision to purchase it has never been made spontaneously.  In contrast, say, from a package of milk or a loaf of bread, which earlier caught sight on the shelf, than the other loaves of bread.  A person has always approached the choice of antivirus expertly, as well as choosing a camera, laptop, PDA, and other "intellectual" products.  As an option, he called a familiar system administrator, read something himself on the Internet on the forum, read a special IT magazine with test results, and only then, realizing he was a technology guru, went to the store for the device he was interested in.  Therefore, neither the grandfathers of frost, nor the naked women with big advertising posters - ‚Äúbuy me and get a mug as a gift‚Äù could not lead the technological guru away from the chosen path.  ‚ÄúVisual communications‚Äù were powerless in front of the guru's intention - he passed the boxes placed for big money in the premium zone (eye level) and confidently found a nondescript box in the lower left corner of the shelf without doubting the correctness of his choice.  Therefore, we had no choice but to think about the highest.

Not just grown - it was like an atomic explosion.  Retail began to grow at a monstrous pace, the owners of printing houses grew rich, barely managing to print boxes, trucks - to take boxes to distributors, distributors - to ship to stores.  Stores became more, both large and small, both in Moscow and in the regions.  There was so much money among people that the cost was not so much software, and laptops became almost imperceptible.  And at some point, the antivirus became a massive product. <br><br>  Here, of course, everyone became thoughtful.  That is, it turned out that antivirus can now be bought by any housewife, emo girl / boy, music teacher, and even people of a million professions who have never read any forums or IT magazines and who do not even have familiar system administrators.  They all had computers, and in their head there was the idea that every computer had an anti-virus (here, of course, thanks to all of us thanks to Evgeny Kaspersky, who for more than ten years scared the entire population of the country with stories about terrible epidemics, the end of the Internet and other horrors).  And all these people were, firstly, susceptible to advertising, secondly, they asked the sellers' advice, and thirdly (horror of horrors!), They could take from the shelf the first available product laid out on a special ‚Äúpallet‚Äù.  This is where it started.  But about how sellers were trained, how they placed advertisements for the first time in their lives, how they learned the word ‚Äúpallet‚Äù and much more - another time. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c31/5a3/0ec/c315a30ec81e3d889206ef61aabccccd.png" width="234" height="170" alt="110.63 KB"><br>  Well, the explosion led to numbers.  The numbers are surprised.  Half of all anti-virus sales in Russia are boxes.  Indeed, there is something to think about, bite your elbows, sometimes even tear the hair on your head, and we will post where we were before (this is me about the world leaders in the antivirus market).  In short, everyone loved retail. <br><br>  The antivirus market in Russia is an extremely entertaining story.  The fact is that antiviruses are, in fact, the only case on the software market where there is intense competition.  Nowhere else is it (Microsoft is not competing with anyone, Nero is also not, ABBYY is not).  Antivirus is the opposite.  There are many of them, and they, of course, differ from each other in technology, the color of the boxes and the design of the interface, but frankly bad products are not here - the bad ones simply do not withstand fierce competition and quickly disappear from the same place where they came from.  As a result, as usual, the strongest survive. <br><br>  At the time of the boxed boom in the stores were seen: Kaspersky Anti-Virus, ESET NOD32 Antivirus, Norton Antivirus, Dr Web, Panda and more boxes of several manufacturers that went unnoticed by the general public.  The cake was divided approximately as follows: Kaspersky Anti-Virus - about 45-50% of all box sales in Russia, ESET NOD32 Antivirus - about 35-40%, Norton Antivirus - 5-10%, Dr Web 5-10%, Panda - very little, the rest is even smaller. <br><br>  And here, when it seemed that we had entered the ‚Äúgolden age‚Äù of software (and we were there), it suddenly ended one day.  A crisis has come.  Everyone began to think who would be the worst?  It turned out that retail.  Not in the sense, of course, that he went somewhere, but he had worse than some.  Federal networks - the most important sales channel for antiviruses in boxes - faced a shortage of working capital, a reduction in credit lines, and therefore had to refuse sales of those antiviruses in boxes that did not have the highest turnover ratio.  Simply put, they stopped selling boxes that buy poorly.  So in the retail antivirus has become less.  For example, in some networks, there are two left, but about four, but for those that are not the first two, it is extremely difficult to stay (now not only those vendors who have not been to retail before biting their elbows, but did not become leaders). <br><br>  What will happen to the boxes next?  The antivirus box boom has gradually shifted to the dominance of sales in the retail of two antiviruses - Kaspersky Anti-Virus and ESET NOD32 Antivirus.  All the others will disappear smoothly from the shelves. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/60827/">https://habr.com/ru/post/60827/</a></p>
