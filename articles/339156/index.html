I went to the zero-transportation booth, scored the coordinates of a point in the Universe and is already leaving in the right place.  But for now it does not work out, however ... Let's talk today about two facets of teleportation - the real physical and the virtual. </p><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2 id="nachnem-s-fiziki-teleportaciya-fotonov-i-kvantovaya-zaputannost">  Let's start with physics: teleportation of photons and quantum entanglement </h2><br><p>  If we turn to physics, then with teleportation of photons, it seems, something happened.  And this is something that the communications workers immediately adopted because it will help create an invulnerable to the weather and other conditions of the communication network.  To be more precise, the main goal of quantum teleportation at the present time is to create completely invulnerable for interception of communication networks. </p><br><p>  More precisely, in such a communication line only an exact copy of the photon is transmitted, and not the photon itself.  And if it is even more precise, then the fact of transmitting to a distance not of the physical object itself, but of its state is called such teleportation.  This is a physical phenomenon called "quantum entanglement".  This phenomenon consists in the fact that in one point of space and time two identical particles arise, in fact having one existence.  Entanglement continues even after particles - in this case photons - are separated from each other.  And if the state of one of the photons changes, the ‚Äútwin photon‚Äù located at another point changes in the same way.  Similarly, if a third particle begins to interact with a tangled pair, then the changes that occur in one of them are mirrored in its twin. </p><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/59/d2/45/59d24503452d6823112106.jpeg"><br><p>  <em><a href="">A source</a></em> </p><br><p>  The physics of elementary particles studies the entanglement of quantum states on the basis of the spin (rotation) of an elementary particle, and quantum confusion is determined by different spin.  In the process of observing objects, scientists saw that there can only be two spins - along and across.  Oddly enough, in other positions the particles do not "pose" to the observer.  Otherwise, imagine that you have two boxes.  In each of them lies one ball with a stripe.  Now we give one box to the astronaut, and he, for example, flies with her to Mars.  But as soon as you open the box and see that the strip on the ball is horizontal, then in another box the ball will automatically have a vertical strip.  This is, so to speak, quantum entanglement, when one object determines the position of another. </p><br><p>  There is, however, another explanation of the principle of quantum communication, when microparticles having a dual nature (as a particle and as a wave) are considered to be part of the world ether consisting of an unlimited set of energy ‚Äúseas‚Äù.  The sea, as is known, can be in motion in the form of visible waves and in the form of drops.  In the same way, all elementary particles can be just a sea (its integral part) or a separate particle - a drop.  The principle of quantum entanglement can be understood if we take into account the fact that elementary particles are in the form of waves.  Having no specific location or characteristics, both particles are in the ocean of energy.  At the moment of the appearance of the observer, the wave ‚Äúturns‚Äù into an object accessible to touch.  The second particle, observing the equilibrium system, acquires opposite properties.  If someone tries to intercept information in such a network, this cannot be overlooked, because the very fact of observing such a quantum system changes its state, which turns it into an ideal secure communication channel.  Since this explanation is either too simple, or contradicts the accepted picture of the world, or is simply not thought through to the end, scientists prefer to operate with their backs. </p><br><h2 id="vnachale-bylo-slovo">  "In the beginning was the word" </h2><br><p>  By the way, the phenomenon of quantum entanglement at the beginning of the last century was studied by Einstein, Bohr, Maxwell, Boyle, Bell, Planck and many other physicists.  Throughout the twentieth century, thousands of scientists have been actively studying this and experimenting around the world. </p><br><p>  In the XXI century, they moved from study to practice, and quantum communication lines based on tangled photons began to work on meters, kilometers, and then tens and hundreds of kilometers.  And then thousands of kilometers, personally demonstrating the promising possibilities of this method of communication.  What is most interesting is that the principle of quantum entanglement can be used to transmit information over long distances instantly, which would seem to contradict Einstein's theory of relativity.  As is known, the latter states that the maximum speed of movement is equal to the speed of light - three hundred thousand kilometers per second.  However, in the case of quantum entanglement, we are not talking about the physical movement of a photon, but only about the transfer of information about its state.  However, such a transfer of information still leaves the possibility of the existence of physical teleportation, since, as they say, everyone in the world is information.  Including matter.  And besides, ‚Äúat the beginning there was a word‚Äù ... This conclusion was reached by quantum physics, in which there are contradictions with the theory of relativity, which physicists are still fighting to eliminate.  In general, in 2008, on the basis of a theoretical database, physicists managed to see quantum confusion with the naked eye, after which we heard every year - and now we managed to transfer information in this way several times further. </p><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/59/d2/45/59d245046e79c607377277.jpeg"><br><p>  <em><a href="">A source</a></em> </p><br><p>  Perhaps this once again demonstrates that progressive humanity is on the verge of great discoveries - movement in space and in time.  And the main question for him is whether he will need it in order to be able to more effectively be able to ‚Äúsoak‚Äù each other in this (or that) space and time.  The second question is that it is not from the fact that time in the Universe is discrete, instantaneous movement over enormous distances makes it possible to fall into different time density (which, they say, is shown by Einstein and Bohr hypotheses).  But compared to the first question, this one is probably not so significant yet.  Although, perhaps, in the future, a positive response to it will become the same reality as, for example, a mobile phone today.  But back to reality. </p><br><h2 id="nachalo-kvantovogo-interneta">  The beginning of the quantum Internet </h2><br><p>  Launched in 2016, the Chinese Micius satellite weighing more than 600 kg was launched into a sun-synchronous orbit of 494.8‚Äì511.1 km altitude using the Changzheng-2D launch vehicle (also known as Long March, or the Long March) .  The satellite is equipped with experimental equipment: an emitter of pairs of entangled photons and a high-speed coherent laser transmitter.  Recently, orbital tests have been successfully completed, and a new quantum communication record has been set between two ground stations that are 1203 km apart.  Scientists have managed to set up the generation of 4,000 pairs of quanto-entangled photons per second in their laboratory in Tibet and send one photon from each pair using a beam of light directed at the satellite receiver.  The satellite has an ultrasensitive detector capable of detecting the quantum states of individual photons arriving from the Earth.  The ground stations then used the effect of quantum teleportation to exchange encrypted messages via satellite.  The device worth about 100 million US dollars was created in the framework of the QUESS (Quantum Science Satellite) project.  Specialists from the combined group of the Chinese and Austrian Academies of Sciences took almost 14 years to achieve this result.  Potentially, the launch of such satellites opens up the possibility of creating global communication systems that are protected from interception at the level of physical principles.  The experiment has already been dubbed "the beginning of the quantum Internet." </p><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/59/d2/45/59d2450481ccb356648673.jpeg"><br><p>  <em><a href="">A source</a></em> </p><br><p>  The satellite orbit parameters were chosen so that the satellite appears in the same place every night.  Ground stations tracked the satellite and installed optical communication lines with it to receive single entangled photons.  The satellite was driven by three optical telescopes in Deling, Lijiang and Nanshan.  According to existing plans, Micius will be the first device in the global network of quantum communications, which the PRC intends to create by 2030.  One of the tasks of his scientific mission is the quantum transmission of information over an interception protected channel between Beijing and Vienna. </p><br><p>  The signal from Micius went through the atmosphere and was simultaneously received by two ground stations.  If a 1200 km long optical fiber were used for communication to distribute pairs of entangled photons on Earth, then due to the loss of signal power with increasing distance, only one pair per second could be transmitted.  But the use of satellite allows to overcome this barrier, and, according to Chinese experts, the speed of photon distribution was increased by 12 orders of magnitude compared with previous technological advances. </p><br><p>  According to the American Defense News magazine, the Pentagon, together with defense research organizations, is quite successfully developing the latest communication system based on quantum teleportation, with which, as we already know, it will be possible to transmit messages all over the world at a speed exceeding the speed of light.  The communication system will be able to ensure complete confidentiality of the data, and it will also be impossible to determine the location of the sender and the recipient. </p><br><p>  The transmitting device will be similar to a laptop computer or the most common mobile phone, and <strong>a prototype</strong> has already been <strong>manufactured</strong> , capable of providing data transmission over a distance of no more than 40 km.  It is said that in 10 years the distance for teleportation will have absolutely no limits, and the communications network being created is only part of the work to create a quantum computer that can simultaneously perform many calculations at a speed that modern computers did not see.  As usual, all the details of this development are strictly classified. </p><br><h2 id="drugoy-put-k-teleportacii--virtualnaya-realnost">  Teleportation is another way - virtual reality </h2><br><p>  From all the above, it follows that the teleportation of any large material objects is not at issue.  Are there any other ways to teleport? <br>  Well, if you can‚Äôt realize teleportation, you can imagine it using virtual reality technology.  Those who wish will be found, and everything will be just like in a famous song: ‚ÄúWhile the Earth is still spinning (it‚Äôs hard to argue with it), the light is still bright (in fact, you can make an image in 8K), Lord, give each of you (that is, each according to your needs). ), which he does not have ... ". </p><br><p>  A couple of years ago, Facebook‚Äôs technical director Mike Shrepfer announced the company's plans for 2025 to ‚Äúactually create a teleport.‚Äù  "This is a device that will allow you to be where you want, with whom you wish, regardless of geographic boundaries," the Business Insider quoted his presentation before the opening of the annual Web Summit technology conference in Dublin.  And in San Francisco, at the F8 Facebook Developer Conference, the head and owner of the company, Mark Zuckerberg, also spoke about the creation of a teleportation station.  It may not be ‚Äúteleportation‚Äù in the traditional sense, but Facebook is going to improve the technology of virtual reality by adding some semblance of physical feedback, thereby deceiving a person‚Äôs feelings and making him think that he is where he really is not. </p><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/59/d2/45/59d24504d9098055572534.jpeg"><br><p>  <em><a href="">A source</a></em> </p><br><p>  Today, many companies see virtual reality systems as an opportunity to offer unique services and get new sources of profit, but the approaches are different for everyone.  Game developers are developing the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãtotal immersion in the gameplay, individual companies are promoting conceptually new learning systems in virtual reality, and Google is trying to create the effect of being present at any point on the map using panoramic video.  Well, the announced Facebook service is closest to the latest version. </p><br><h2 id="tri-zadachi-virtualnoy-realnosti">  Three tasks of virtual reality </h2><br><p>  At the same time, in order to achieve the above goal, it is necessary to solve three tasks, because of the unresolved issues of which, in fact, all the virtual reality created in the world is perceived as ‚Äúfake‚Äù for the time being.  Of course, for this purpose, further improvements will be made to the Oculus virtual reality helmet, the manufacturer of which Facebook acquired in the summer of 2014 for $ 2 billion. </p><br><p>  In addition, first of all, it is necessary to enable the user to see himself in virtual reality.  For example, touching something with his hands, he should, at a minimum, see these hands.  In the second half of last year, Facebook planned to release Oculus Touch controllers that would be able to track the movements of the user's hands and allow him to interact with other objects of the virtual world.  In addition, Oculus tests the interaction of the pressure sensor with the camera in order to capture facial expression data.  As a result, the user's avatar in virtual reality will depict the same emotions that he displays in the real world. </p><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/59/d2/45/59d245056aad4899600346.jpeg"><br><p>  <em><a href="">A source</a></em> </p><br><p>  The next task is to accurately simulate the surrounding user space.  To solve this problem, Oculus acquired in May 2015, the company Surreal Vision, which is engaged in computer vision technologies.  The specialists were set to simulate the world around them and embed this picture into virtual reality in real time.  This technology is still in its early stages, and, according to Schrepfer, ‚Äúhuge‚Äù opportunities are already opening up. </p><br><p>  Another problem that needs to be addressed is that users create their own virtual worlds.  For this, the Medium program will be bundled with Touch controllers, which will allow users to design three-dimensional objects. </p><br><h2 id="stanciya-teleportacii">  "Teleportation Station" </h2><br><p>  The futuristic name "teleportation station" was chosen for the virtual reality technology developed in conjunction with Oculus VR.  It is being tested on the territory of the company's research center.  The ‚Äúteleportation station‚Äù created on Facebook creates the effect of moving to another place, broadcasting a circular panorama (360 ¬∞).  Moreover, a person can not only look around, but also look at the sky or at his feet.  True, if the sky already looks exceptionally realistic, then at the bottom so far no legs are displayed.  During the conference, to demonstrate the new technology, everyone was ‚Äúmoved‚Äù from the conference room in San Francisco to the company's headquarters, located in Menlo Park (San Mateo County, California). </p><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/59/d2/45/59d245058654f364485945.jpeg"><br><p>  <em><a href="">A source</a></em> </p><br><p>  "Looking around, I could walk through the central courtyard on Facebook campus and see some engineers and developers walking purposefully from building to building while others sip coffee in the shade of umbrellas," the Slashgear journalist, who tested the prototype, described his feelings. "Teleportation stations" at the conference.  According to him, the panorama for the first time began to be displayed very naturally and smoothly - without jerks, the effect of jitter, geometric distortions and other artifacts.  After the "move" visually everything looks as realistic as possible.  However, the charm passes when you try to touch any object.  In the current version, the ‚Äúteleportation station‚Äù does not allow interacting with virtual objects, although, for example, there are already other designs with corresponding solutions in the form of gloves and an ‚Äúendless omnidirectional treadmill for virtual reality systems. </p><br><p>  ‚ÄúTeleportation‚Äù is achieved through the use of a modified Oculus Rift helmet, stuffed with twenty-four cameras, as well as numerous sensors based on microelectromechanical systems (MEMS), determining the position of the user's head, current speed and direction of its movement in space.  In fact, there is no unique know-how here - it‚Äôs all about the exceptional accuracy of the system and the highest level of detail.  They create the effect of moving to another place that is perceived as teleportation. </p><br><p>  It is expected that, for the time being, the main area of ‚Äã‚Äãapplication of the teleportation station will be broadcasting panoramic video from sports and TV shows, performing first-person tricks, as well as specific sketches of the most beautiful places on the planet that most of us are unlikely to be able to visit in person.  Facebook is ready to present a version of 3D panoramas in their social network.  You can view them using the Oculus Rift or Samsung Gear helmet and a specialized application. </p><br><p>  The ultimate goal of Facebook will be the emergence of a democratic information sphere, in which people from every corner of the world can virtually move to any place and do there what they want.  It will be possible to embed the space surrounding a person into virtual reality and the emergence of the ability to manipulate objects that do not exist in reality. </p><br><p>  For example, and even above all - in games.  Players will no longer be passive observers, they will become active participants in the process of a kind of teleportation of a person into the game space and will get everything they want. </p><br><p>  Do players want to immerse themselves in virtual reality?  Feel all that they are experiencing in the game, with the help of a vest with the technology of transmission of tactile sensations, hold a weapon in their hands and touch objects with the help of special VR-gloves?  - You are welcome.  And the Ambiotherm system, developed at the National University of Singapore, will allow you to feel even a whiff of wind thanks to two fans and a change in temperature due to the module located at the back of the head. </p><br><p>  The gaming space of virtual reality is expanding from the game room to the whole house, virtual flying machines and home robots will soon appear.  For their implementation requires new technology.  Including those that were announced by Facebook. </p><br><h2 id="3d-skanirovanie">  3D scanning </h2><br><p>  Of course, there is still a lot of work to do.  It goes everywhere, including in our country.  For example, in the Technopolis "Moscow" unique technologies are being introduced for the production of various devices, which will also create an alternative to teleportation.  In particular, now in the construction of various objects, bridges, houses, for a clear understanding of exactly how the object should be built, 3D scanning is used.  3D copies of a human figure are made in 30 seconds, and during this time the object must stand motionless while the sensors rotate around it ‚Äî depths and a color camera.  Depth sensors capture the geometry, the camera - the color of the object. </p><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/59/d2/49/59d249d38a3a1509501675.jpeg"><br><p>  <em><a href="">A source</a></em> </p><br><p>  For half a minute the devices take about 4,000 photos, and a minute is taken by the reconstruction of the model, which shows the object in the smallest detail.  First, the geometry is constructed from a cloud of points, then color information is superimposed ‚Äî texture, and that's it, you can look at your 3D model on the screen.  This model can be sent to other worlds or simply to a clothing store.  Digital fitting rooms already exist, when you come to the shopping center, enter the scanner, the system removes almost 200 parameters from your body that are compared with the size line of the clothes manufacturer.  After a couple of minutes in your phone - a list of things that exactly fit your size, and you can choose and buy them. </p><br><h2 id="virtualnaya-zhizn">  Virtual life </h2><br><p>  But even more exciting prospects, of course, will be opened thanks to the international army of developers in providing the opportunity to virtually move to any place and realize their desires there (probably, nobody has yet thought about this effect on tourist traffic).  How many people dissatisfied with themselves, others or the world around will be able, finally, to go where they will be well.  Or create a world in which they will be satisfying and comfortable.  And it may very well be that not everyone will want to return from there, which can become a serious problem for the future of mankind, some aspects of which can already be foreseen today.  Take at least a scandalous fact from the life of one of the most advanced and digitized societies on the planet - the Japanese - where half of citizens already remain virgins by 30 years of age due to easily accessible manga, Hentai, and other products of virtual debauchery, not counting the corresponding android robots.  In China, gaming addicts, who even had a ‚Äúnon-virtual‚Äù reality for gambling addiction, are already being treated in special games. </p><br><p>  But how many ambitious people can give something sublime, how many oppositionists can be given the opportunity to ‚Äústeer‚Äù, how many politicians can be dipped into different facets of their policies, how many egoists can be given the opportunity to tamper with themselves material values, how many maniacs will lose their real life to the joy of citizens and the police how many lonely hearts will be able to find the right half. </p><br><p>  Only who will feed them here while they are there? </p><br><p>  Lord, give me a little bit of everything ... </p><br><p>  And don't forget about me. </p><br><p>  Publication author: <br>  Alexander GOLYSHKO, Systems Analyst, Technoserv Group of Companies </p><br><p>  <em>Based on materials: BBC.com, Gridder.ru, Facebook.com, computerra.ru, habrahabr.ru, fb.ru, portalinweb.com, iq.intel.ru, chudesamag.ru, Francois Villon, Bulat Okudzhava.</em> <em><br></em> </p><br><p>  The article was published in the magazine <a href="">"Radio"</a> . </p></div>
