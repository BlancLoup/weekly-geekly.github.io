    <a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h2>  <font color="#2196f3">Why we became a registrar and what guided us</font> </h2><br>  Before we received accreditation, we registered domains .RU / . through different registrars: the main supplier was <a href="https://reg.ru/">reg.ru</a> , we also worked with <a href="https://r01.ru/">r01</a> and <a href="https://nic.ru/">nic.ru.</a>  Some of our domains are still serviced by these registrars.  In addition, we work with these registrars on domains in areas other than .RU / ..  If the client wanted to transfer the domain to us for service, we went to meet him and transferred him to our personal account of the current domain registrar. <br><br>  This created a large number of problems both for us and for our clients.  There were cases of delimitation of domains, about which we had to learn from clients, errors on the part of recorders software.  The very support of three different APIs created difficulties.  As for domain prices, our partner prices were only about 10% higher than the price that the Coordination Center offered, so this was not the main reason for becoming an independent registrar ... <br><br>  The main reason is the complete management of the domain name by our company and the lack of dependence of us and our users on possible failures and errors on the part of our partners. <br><br>  The first attempt to apply for accreditation was in the summer of 2014, but then, unfortunately, in connection with other matters (at that time we were actively planning to enter the international market, there will be a second attempt ahead =), the folder with the documents remained just a folder with the name "Registrar Project". <br><br>  The second time we decided to become a registrar in .RU / . zones at the beginning of 2016, when it was reported that the transfer of domains between registrars would become paperless.  Of course, we were extremely disappointed that, unlike international zones, our focal point of national domains did not adhere to the same scheme of work, and the money is taken only for the transfer, and not for the extension at the moment of transfer (which is clearly not conducive to market liberalization ).  It can be said that it was impossible to do so due to the fact that the maximum term for registering a domain in .RU / . zones is 1 year, but what prevents to make it longer? <br><br>  Nevertheless, the transfer procedure between registrars has become easier, which means that those who wish can transfer domains to us, and since we have already started studying the question of how to become a registrar for the second time, we decided to finish the job. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#2196f3">What you need to do to get accreditation</font> </h2><br>  Domain zones .RU / . regulates the <a href="https://cctld.ru/">Coordination Center of the national domain of the Internet (https://cctld.ru/)</a> . <br><br>  To date, 46 registrars are accredited ( <a href="https://cctld.ru/ru/registrators/">https://cctld.ru/ru/registrators/</a> ), and it is noteworthy that 13 of them, including us, were accredited last year.  Separately, I would like to congratulate our colleagues in the field of hosting, who have received accreditation recently - this is a step in the right direction.  Perhaps other companies, like us, have decided to do this due to a change in the policy of domain transfer between registrars. <br><br>  All information on how to get accreditation can and should be found on their website - <a href="https://cctld.ru/ru/docs/">https://cctld.ru/ru/docs/</a> <br><br><h3>  We read <a href="https://cctld.ru/ru/docs/project/accr_treb_21042014.pdf">requirements</a> to the future registrar and we correspond to them. </h3><br>  An accreditation can be obtained by a legal entity of the Russian Federation having a working office and a minimum number of employees to work as a registrar.  It will be necessary to prove (confirm) the coordinating center a stable financial position, the ability to ensure the sustainability of the software when working with the Registry and data backup. <br>  And also: insure activities as a registrar and prepare a prototype of the site, which will contain all the information regarding future work as a registrar. <br><br>  Let's analyze some points that can put in a stupor. <br><blockquote>  1. The Registrar shall: <br>  ... <br>  1.3.  timely insure professional liability related to domain name registration activities: <br>  1.3.1.  for Registrars with the length of accreditation of at least 1 (one) year - for an amount of at least 15,000,000 (fifteen million) rubles or 500,000 (five hundred thousand) US dollars; <br>  1.3.2.  for a newly accredited organization - in the amount of not less than 30,000,000 (thirty million) rubles or to provide proof of intentions to carry out such insurance within a period of not more than 1 (one) month from the date of receipt of accreditation; <br></blockquote><br>  This item can cause difficulties, as if you simply turn to any insurance company with questions of insurance activities as a registrar, this causes some confusion for insurers.  Therefore, here it is still desirable to get on the specialist who has already issued such insurance.  If you don‚Äôt work out this issue on your <a href="">own</a> , write to <a href="">manager@beget.com</a> , we <a href="">‚Äôll give</a> you contacts.  The cost of insurance at the time of accreditation was about 30 thousand rubles. <br><br><blockquote>  1.6.  Comply with the requirements set forth in the Technical Conditions for Interaction with the Domain Registration System (hereinafter referred to as the ‚ÄúTechnical Conditions‚Äù) that have entered into force.  The newly accredited organization must undergo technical tests for compliance with the Technical Conditions within 1 (one) year after the decision on its accreditation is made.  Until the technical tests are successfully completed, the newly accredited organization will not be granted access to domain name registries, except for access to the test registry in the manner established by the Technical Testing Regulations <br></blockquote><br>  After receiving accreditation there is 1 year to pass technical tests. <br>  How to pass them and what difficulties we had to face, we will tell in our next article. <br><br><blockquote>  2. for the provision of domain name registration services, the Registrar shall have the necessary number of qualified employees to perform the following functions: <br>  - administrative issues; <br>  - financial issues; <br>  - technical issues; <br>  - interaction with users and administrators; <br>  - information security; <br>  - legal issues; <br>  - interaction with law enforcement agencies. <br><br>  The registrar is obliged to provide the Coordinator with information (contact information) for interaction on the above issues and to immediately inform the Coordinator about changes in this information. <br></blockquote><br>  Everything is simple enough, you need to provide a list of employees who will be responsible or are already responsible for certain issues. <br>  In this case, it is fine if the same employee will be responsible for several spectra of work.  If you, for example, provide hosting services to your clients, then anyway, all the above questions concerned you, and you worked with law enforcement agencies. <br><blockquote>  4. The registrar is obliged to provide the user, including publishing and timely updating on his website dedicated to the registering activities, complete and reliable information: <br></blockquote><br>  Under this item, you will need to prepare a prototype of the site with the contents of all the information about you, sample applications and a description of all possible actions with domains.  Preparation of the site will certainly take time, but the task is not too complicated, given the fact that all the information about actions with domains can be viewed, for example, on our website <a href="https://beget.com/ru/domain-register">https://beget.com/ru/domain-register</a> <br><blockquote>  6. The Registrar shall develop and apply in practice instructions for personnel containing a description of the Registrar's procedures when performing actions related to the registration and subsequent maintenance of their domain names. <br></blockquote><br>  As part of the accreditation, you will need to develop various regulations for employees who will need to be provided to the Coordination Center.  In fact, this may be a single document describing all the procedures for working with domain names. <br><br>  Example regulations: <br><ul><li>  <a href="">Rules of action in emergency situations</a> </li><li>  <a href="">Registration / renewal process regulations</a> </li></ul><br><blockquote>  14. The registrar is obliged to ensure the stable functioning of the software and hardware complex in case of equipment failure, power supply and communication systems;  have backup tools that provide full data recovery in case of any system failures, to the state at the time not more than a day before the failure. <br>  15. The Registrar is obliged to have the means of protection against the actions of third parties aimed at obtaining unauthorized access to the Registrar's software and hardware or disrupting its normal functioning. <br></blockquote><br>  To comply with this requirement, it is necessary to ensure the creation of backups, availability of backup equipment and round-the-clock (or almost round-the-clock) monitoring, as well as investing in ensuring the security of stored data. <br><br><h3>  Fill out the form and prepare a package of documents </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/rc/bl/ng/rcblngohge4d79jkmpe0flzii7y.jpeg"><br><br>  If you feel the strength and ability to meet all the requirements described, you need to open the Accreditation Agreement ( <a href="https://cctld.ru/ru/docs/project/accr_polo_21042014.pdf">https://cctld.ru/ru/docs/project/accr_polo_21042014.pdf</a> ), find point 2 and prepare a package of documents in strict accordance with the list and then send it to the mailing address of the Coordination Center. <br>  If formally all signs are observed and the documents correspond to the above list, then the Coordination Center will send you an accreditation bill within 3 days after receiving the package of documents.  On the day we receive accreditation, the cost of checking your competence to register domain names was 80,000 rubles.  This amount is not refundable, even if the Coordination Center will refuse to accredit you. <br><br><ul><li>  We pay the bill for the accreditation check. </li><li>  We are waiting for verification of documents and compliance with all requirements. </li></ul><br>  During the verification process, the Coordination Center will contact you and, possibly, point out some flaws in the documents or in the questionnaire.  Documents are checked within a month. <br><br><h3>  We get a decision on accreditation or rejection </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/-i/cd/mw/-icdmwrg0w97dcqk6y1x2asvhdk.png"><br>  When you receive a refusal, please note that you can re-apply only after 3 months.  If you are lucky and the Coordination Center has made a positive decision about your accreditation, then you will be invited to sign the Accreditation Agreement.  This Agreement must be signed within 20 days from the date of the decision on accreditation. <br><br>  To get accreditation is half the battle, then there is a year to proceed directly to the registration of domains. <br><br>  To work with the Registry, you can write your own solution or use the software from the Technical Center of the Internet JSC under the name ‚ÄúVirtual Registrar‚Äù.  Read more about the Virtual Registrar <a href="https://www.tcinet.ru/services/3/">here</a> .  ‚ÄúVirtual Registrar‚Äù is a paid product, and for its use it is necessary to pay from 22 rubles.  for each domain registration, or 10,000 rubles per month.  for unlimited tariff. <br><br>  Now we are debugging and bringing our registration software to mind. We plan to put it into <b>OpenSource</b> .  In our next article we will talk about how we passed the technical tests and share our development. <br><br>  PS: if someone needs examples of documents, write to <a href="http://manager%40beget.ru/">manager@beget.ru</a> , we will be happy to help =) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/331366/">https://habr.com/ru/post/331366/</a></p>
