Let's talk about it with Artem Boikov.  He uses Delphi, and today he will talk about his projects on FireMonkey. <br>  Artem Boykov is an individual developer, his company's website is <a href="http://www.oilsoft-service.com/">www.oilsoft-service.com</a> .  He specializes in custom software development, there are also projects for a wide range of users. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/de1/ad6/264/de1ad6264aa7cb5373afc77bd5e4a6b7.jpg"><br><br>  Embarcadero: We know that you recently released your first commercial projects made in Delphi and FireMonkey.  Tell me what these projects are.

      Artyom: the first project is an application for setting up a downhole television system (ZTS) used during drilling of oil wells.  The device is connected via USB to the program and carries out its configuration.  The second is a system for administering a recreation center.  Allows you to reserve houses and visually display customer accommodation.  More information on the website. <br><br>  E: Do you work in a team?  Or are you an individual developer? <br><br>  A: There was a time, hired an assistant.  But mostly an individual developer.  Always dreamed of working in a team among pros. <br><br>  E: What is your general experience using Delphi? <br><br>  A: Programming carried away since childhood.  Around fifth grade, parents bought a Delta-s computer.  Many people probably remember what kind of devices they were when the programs were written on a magnetic tape.  Basic was implemented there.  I liked him.  I dreamed of making a 3D image with rotation on it.  I just learned the world of programming.  Since childhood I have dreamed of being a programmer.  When I entered the institute as a programmer, I ran into Pascal for the first time.  After a brief study, I began to realize that Delphi is very convenient and understandable. <br><br>  Began to compare it with C ++.  Forgive me "Sishniki", this language seemed too synthesized and difficult to learn.  The graduation project was written in Delphi.  In 2006, approximately I moved to the post of programmer, before that I was a geologist and geophysicist.  And then I thought that with this you can earn good money.  Then he opened his own business. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  E: On your site there are descriptions and other projects.  Did you do them on Delphi with VCL? <br><br>  A: All projects presented on the site were made on Delphi + VCL.  Only the last two projects were made on Delphi XE3, using FMX technology.  In fact, a lot of projects.  The first commercial project was created in 2006.  Presented on the site is not all.  Much left overs.  The site has posted projects that are already used in various organizations. <br><br>  E: What made you try FireMonkey in real combat conditions? <br><br>  A: I read a lot about this technology.  Bribed primarily multiplatform.  There have been many attempts to create something non-commercial.  Every time I threw it - I had to work on commercial projects.  But then I set myself a goal: either I am doing a commercial project on FMX, or I will never study this technology.  It was the best approach to studying it. <br><br>  E: You got very beautiful interfaces.  Did you somehow pick up the extra pictures? <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/0ba/b26/ed5/0bab26ed575f344edbab2f045af2f0ad.png"><br><br>  A: Thank you.  It's nice to hear that someone likes your work.  In fact, many pictures and special effects are the merit of FMX technology.  Pictures were created directly in Delphi, as if in a graphical editor.  For example, if you look at the image of the chip: <br>  It consists of several elements plus additional special effects: smooth (pleasant) attenuation and highlighting. <br><br>  E: It is clear that for you, the aesthetics of interfaces is an important component of good software.  Did you try for yourself or for your users? <br><br>  A: I did it so that I would like it myself.  Many times reworked.  Experimented with color effects.  The main thing is not to overdo it.  The design of the program is almost the most important criterion for a commercial project.  Well, you always need to focus on the end user.  I imagine him as a child who first sat at the computer.  Everything should be very clear and clear. <br><br>  E: Was it difficult after VCL to switch to FireMonkey?  What was the main difficulty? <br><br>  A: Yes, there were certain difficulties.  But because of my character, I always strive to understand everything and reach the end.  FMX is quite a young technology.  As a commercial software developer, I see great potential in it.  For me, the difficulty was in finding answers to questions.  How to do this or that.  All problems have been resolved.  Although time was spent.  Shoveling a lot of material, in passing, you remember a lot of useful things.  So I do not think this is such a disadvantage.  Many things had to be circumvented in various ways, or redrawing the project due to the fact that there were not enough components like in the VCL.  But as they say, mistakes are not made by one who does nothing.  Embarcadero employs real people, just like you and me. <br><br>  E: What would you advise other developers who use Delphi and VCL, but have not yet started FireMonkey? <br><br>  A: Undoubtedly, this technology requires the attention of both young and experienced programmers.  I advise you to study FMX on real projects, as I did.  This is a very promising technology.  Progress occurs not because it is easy, but because it is difficult.  Of course, it‚Äôs impossible to know everything, but it‚Äôs just necessary to study FMX, it‚Äôs the future. <br><br>  E: Congratulations on your successful releases.  I wish new and successful projects! <br><br>  A: Thank you!  With all my heart, I wish the company prosperity and further development of FireMonkey technology! <br><br>  E: What are your future plans? <br><br>  A: Mobile development.  There is a lot of interest from customers for mobile versions of my applications, there are also separate, purely ‚Äútablet‚Äù orders.  I am already engaged in the creation of mobile applications for iOS (iPhone, iPad), but I have high hopes for Android support from Delphi in the near future. <br><br>  As an individual developer, it is very important for me to use a single code base for applications on different mobile platforms.  In addition to the classic business logic, I focus on 3D.  This infographics for visualization of business data, and subject-oriented reproduction of models of real scenes.  I look forward to the release of Delphi! <br><br>  E: Follow the news from Embarcadero! <br><br>  A: Of course! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/186464/">https://habr.com/ru/post/186464/</a></p>
