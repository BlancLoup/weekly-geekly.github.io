  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Opening the blog "Technology for the good"</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Hello dear habravchane! <br>  Long ago, I ‚Äúthreatened‚Äù to create a blog dedicated to people with disabilities.  Yes, there was not enough time.  This time, my hands, nevertheless, reached the long-conceived idea and began to write. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/493/726/8ea/4937268eabfa080d78ff70e4d6ed8c9d.jpg" width="180" height="180" alt="disabled" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="left">  I especially think this is relevant against the background of the fact that on Habr√© they rarely dealt with topics related to people with disabilities or people with disabilities.  I do not know why it happened.  Either we, who consider themselves healthy people, are embarrassed about this and are afraid, or whether we care little about it, until we encounter it with family or close friends. <br><br>  Nevertheless, over the past two months, the number of articles devoted to such people on Habr√© has increased significantly.  There was a topic about the <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blog/ui_design_and_usability/44654.html">technology of mouse cursor control with vzlyad</a> .  There was a recent note about <a href="http://absolvo.habrahabr.ru/blog/46522.html">harmful caps</a> that a healthy person would hardly understand.  What can we say about people with vision problems.  If the only problem of these people were captchas ... Then everything would be just great ... <br><a name="habracut"></a>

      There was an article about the <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blog/i_am_advertising/45517.html">portal for the disabled</a> .  The case is certainly commendable.  It only seems to me that it is necessary not to divide people into healthy and disabled people, but try to give them the opportunity to feel the same as others.  Provide an opportunity to become part of a ‚Äúhealthy runet‚Äù.  Give them the opportunity to enjoy the same resources that you use.  Optimize a bit of the interface, increase the text, write the correct tags in HTML, and a person can participate in discussions on interesting topics as well as healthy people as well as we are.  They are not lepers, to be separated from them.  It‚Äôs just that their health has been a little undermined or trouble has happened, and it has become difficult for them to remain a part of society, since it does not take care of them. <br><br>  <a href="http://geektimes.ru/users/curlybrace/" class="user_link">CurlyBrace</a> CurlyBrace, under the impression of the London <a href="http://geektimes.ru/users/media/" class="user_link">media</a> conference, <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blog/habracast/43773.html">spoke</a> in <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blog/habracast/43773.html">Habrakasta</a> about new developments and optimization of HTML-code for the blind.  It was after his story about such a new direction as optimization for people with disabilities, I realized that this topic is almost not familiar to habravchanam.  And this means that in RuNet most sites are designed only for completely healthy people. <br><br>  Even if you are not interested in ‚Äúpeople with problems‚Äù, I can distinguish at least one benefit for you from the whole text and code optimization process.  Which one?  Did you know that <strong>according to unofficial data, every fourth person sitting at a computer has deviations, which to some extent may limit its capabilities</strong> on the Internet on un-optimized resources.  It turns out that with a little effort, you can increase the number of unique visitors of the resource by 25% !!!  Not bad, is it? <br><br>  As if there wasn‚Äôt and why they wouldn‚Äôt have decided for themselves, I open the blog ‚ÄúTechnologies for the Good‚Äù with this post.  In it, I want to raise discussion and tips on optimizing HTML-code, user interface, design and writing texts.  In fact, the <strong>W3C</strong> even has a whole section dedicated to people with disabilities and people with disabilities.  From it you, without any articles on Habr√©, will be able to learn the most important points in the process of writing code. <br><br>  Also, I would like to see in this blog all kinds of advanced technologies and gadgets to help such people.  I happened to visit several small exhibitions devoted to this, so I hope to find time and acquaint you with such devices.  I would also be interested to read about the development of such technologies myself.  I invite all habravchan who have this kind of useful information to write in this blog. <br><br>  <strong>Let's help others as long as we have the opportunity!</strong>  <strong>Maybe then someone will help us.</strong> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/29698/">https://habr.com/ru/post/29698/</a></p>
