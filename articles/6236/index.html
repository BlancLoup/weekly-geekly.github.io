  <section class="page js-page"><h1>On the necessary trends in the development of the CPC</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  About PDA <br>  DEVELOPMENT TREND <br>  PDA manufacturers are moving along the path of increasing capacity.  I think that day is not far when a dual-core PDA appears.  I consider it necessary to move away from the traditional views on the progress of handheld devices and to place development accents somewhat differently than now. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  I want to talk about changes in the development of computers, which could significantly move us all forward, stopping the linear tactics of increasing the capacity of PDAs and other devices. <br>  WHAT WE HAVE NOW <br>  PDA is now rather a large calculator, organizer, book reader, e-mail, a bit of the Internet.  It's no secret that any of us wanted the PDA to fully replace the home computer.  But, marching along the current paths of development, it will not happen soon. <br>  In adopting new development guidelines, it is important to use the main guidelines: <br><ul><li>  it is impossible for innovations to require the complete destruction of the old base for the sake of becoming new.  Users should be able to use (or at least try) new developments on the equipment that is available at the moment; </li><li>  New technologies should have a real benefit, and not be an interpretation of existing technologies. </li></ul><br>  Following these two rules, I will state my idea in detail. <br>  NEW DIRECTION <br>  This is how I think I should have a modern PDA. <br><ul><li>  All currently known integrated devices for accessing the Internet and for direct communication with other devices; </li><li>  Clear screen with high resolution (minimum 640x480). </li></ul><br>  That's all!!!  Apart from, of course, the processors that will organize the process and the necessary amounts of RAM. <br>  The whole point is to use the power not of the PDA itself, but of the home (or any other) computer.  Further, our ‚Äúnew‚Äù PDA, which I described above, I will reduce to the CPC. <br>  So, NKPK wirelessly will connect to a computer, terminal, etc.  numerous devices ().  The NCPC will send a small amount of information to Y, for example, the coordinates of the point where the stylus is currently located.  And the response signal from Y will have a signal similar to what is being sent to the monitor (you can change the cipher, the degree of compression, but the meaning is one).  By exchanging in this way, you can perform actions of any complexity for which Y is capable, and the NPCK will play the role of a remote touch panel. <br>  Every day there are more and more new models of PDAs, more and more powerful. <br>  The organization of the CPCC will reduce the need for modernization by 10 times or even more. <br>  FANTASY <br>  The prospects for such an organization are very high. <br>  Imagine that everyone has an NKPK with his personal number.  At home, instead of a desktop computer, somewhere in the closet, on the wall, a ‚Äúfamily server‚Äù hangs neatly, allowing all family members to connect to it, but with different priorities, of course.  All use at the same time the resources of hard drives, writing devices, etc. <br>  When a software malfunction occurs, an e-mail (ICQ) request is made to the admin, who (rejoice admins) for specials.  Password, without leaving and at home, gets access to the broken "family server" and treats it remotely. <br>  NKPK with mass production will cost a penny.  And such a device can afford each. <br>  The main thing is that now the NPCK can draw drawings and three-dimensional modeling in his teeth (so much so that your chess is there). <br>  With a relatively small amount of outgoing information, the NCC will work for a very long time. <br>  I believe that the PDA line should not be interrupted at all, since  NKPK is only the key to the door and as an independent element - just a set of electronics. <br>  Although the idea is quite utopian (well, where can we get such inet speeds throughout the whole territory of the Russian Federation?), And who dares to take the flag in hand.  But the choice of such landmarks of progress, provided a big leap forward.  By the way, the NCPC gives much more freedom to programmers, who are usually constrained by the ‚Äúiron‚Äù restrictions of the PDA, which require a special code.  Any software for an ordinary PC will be used.  And even the operating system does not play a role. <br>  Maybe the idea is not new, but I have not met with such articles.  If someone read something somewhere like that - tell me. <br><br>  Always glad, Andrey Koval. </div>
