Overview of interesting advertising networks and not only</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  When developing games or applications, each developer has questions about monetization.  Naturally, AdMob immediately comes to mind, although there are many more such systems, and it is possible, in some cases, it makes sense to even abandon it.  After all, banner advertising is usually quite intrusive and ‚Äúhits at random‚Äù, where more personalized advertising is more interesting, in this case, the advertiser, publisher, and most importantly, the end user will benefit. <br>  We have compiled a list of unusual advertising systems that can help developers monetize their applications.  As well as a brief overview of services and prices for advertisers. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage3/9d3/b9c/71a/9d3b9c71a8785c6c33063762a83f7ec3.jpg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h1>  AppGlimpse (games only) </h1><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage3/0cf/e34/e89/0cfe34e8924e42a0fad2eb1738e3533e.jpeg"><br>  The system provides an ad module embedded inside the application that allows you to play (try) a demo version of someone else's game in your game. <br>  Demo games are stored in the cloud developer system Agawi. <br>  The demo version of the game lasts about 2 minutes, after which it directs the user to the full version.  At the moment, the beta version of the advertising system allows you to work only with the Android platform, but the creators promise in future a mandatory support for iOS. <br>  Already, you can try your luck and sign up for a beta test of the system. <br>  <a href="http://agawi.io/appglimpse.html">Site</a> <br>  Example of integration with World of Goo: <br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/tcW9awR5an4%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700021,15700186,15700191,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhjdvS_IS0ZTMUHz1mhjzSMqwbRk_w" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  <u>Opinion:</u> An interesting substitute for video advertising, since the probability that a user downloads a game after plays a short demo is higher than after watching a video or banner. <br><br><h1>  Heyzap (games only) </h1><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage3/b58/ca0/18f/b58ca018f5e4be5680b2678cb04c1932.jpg">

      Game network HeyZap is a social advertising platform for mobile games, recommends the game user, based on his preferences (already installed applications). <br>  All this thanks to Heyzap, which allows users to add friends to mobile games and share tips and badges with them (check-in rewards in games). <br>  HeyZap provides developers with the usual fullscreen advertising with pay per install.  It is also possible to integrate with the HeyZap network itself using modules for sharing records and inviting friends, both registered in Heyzap, and beyond.  A single system of achievements, allows you to store all the achievements in one place and have access to them even when the platform is changed from iOS to Android.  At its core, HeyZap is similar to Apple‚Äôs cross-platform Game Center counterpart. <br>  Advertisers: also provides the function of creating an advertising company for a game using a CPI scheme, with a recommended minimum bid of $ 1.50 and a flexible targeting system.  (Only available for Android and iOS). <br>  <a href="http://www.heyzap.com/">Site</a> <br>  A small review of the application: <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/JWA-SZJjq7s%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700021,15700186,15700191,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhjvwPJaSTTVS0aKNREvcCNfwWssrw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  eCPM: ranging between $ 1.0 to $ 6.0 <br>  Withdrawal: The minimum amount for a transaction by bank transfer / paypal / check is $ 100. <br>  <u>Opinion:</u> A good advertising system, but I do not think that we will use it in the future, because it is suitable mainly for social games. <br><br><h1>  PlayHaven (games and applications) </h1><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage3/39c/fed/8f7/39cfed8f7927c1ad5c922ae1dc2d78a4.png"><br>  First of all, it‚Äôs interesting with its system for organizing domestic sales and the possibility of choosing games, whose full-screen banners will be shown in the publisher‚Äôs game. <br>  To monetize an app or a game, PlayHaven offers full-size ads, the More games and Feature Games buttons (‚ÄúBest games‚Äù) with a paylist for installation (CPI). <br>  In addition, you can use push notifications, rewards in the form of any kind of in-game items, automatic greetings and upgrade messages, for example, to improve communication with the player. <br>  Another interesting feature of the system is the ability to voluntarily collect information about users (name, gender, e-mail) in exchange for some kind of in-game reward. <br>  Advertisers: To start your advertising company you will need to contact the manager by email. <br>  <a href="http://www.playhaven.com/">Site</a> <br><br><iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/n3ZaODEInnY%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700021,15700186,15700191,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhgLldfV-TWYgroIxw99d5IYUVT5ag" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  Withdrawal: bank transfer / paypal / checks.  The minimum amount available for transfer is $ 300.  To receive money, you will need to fill out a form and send it by e-mail. <br>  <u>Opinion:</u> The More Games button is a good solution for publishers, because if the user liked your game, the chance that it will download something else is much higher than if it downloaded by clicking on the full-size banner.  And changing advertising banners on the fly without having to arrange an update is a useful thing. <br><br><br><h1>  MobPartner (games and applications) </h1><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage3/91e/795/d23/91e795d23d1dd3c874d037f047a2c776.jpg"><br>  It offers through its sdk to exchange with other developers (advertisers) conventional advertising banners, with a fixed fee for the installation.  You can set requirements for the content of the application, third-party advertising systems and countries where the main audience is located. <br>  <a href="http://web.mobpartner.com/">Site</a> <br>  CPI examples: from $ 0.48 per game from independent developers to $ 3.59 for Candy Crush Saga on Android. <br>  Withdrawal: The minimum amount for a transaction by bank transfer is $ 500, paypal / MoneyBookers - $ 50. <br>  <u>Opinion:</u> Unfortunately, there are quite a few successful examples of use in Russia, so the desire to get acquainted with the capabilities of this network does not yet arise. <br><br><h1>  Kiip (games and applications) </h1><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage3/359/9cc/47d/3599cc47d9f9da575c5b5be7c5bd1eab.png"><br><br>  One of the most exotic advertising systems, instead of showing advertising banners to users, rewards them with real prizes for using the game or application.  Kiip collaborates with brands like Best Buy, M &amp; M's, McDonald's, Skittles, Pepsi, Dr.  Pepper, American Apparel and selects prizes based on the specifics of the application.  For example, for a fitness app, you will never get a set of cheeseburgers as a prize. <br>  Rewards are given to users upon reaching a certain level in the game or after receiving an achievement.  If the reward cannot be received or delivered in the country where the player is located, then for such a user the presence of Kipp in the application will remain completely unnoticed. <br>  Kipp also holds regular prize draws from big brands (for example, Amazon's gift card), which can be used both to attract users to the game, and to return users who have left in pursuit of a big reward.  The only condition for this is that the game must have a system with a set of points in order to evaluate the best result. <br>  The developer shares the profit with Kiip 50/50 from advertising for each attracted user who has received an award. <br>  Advertisers: Kiip provides an opportunity to create an advertising campaign with prizes.  You need to set a price for user involvement (CPE), the recommended bid is $ 1, as well as the daily budget of the campaign, set up targeting and specify a link to a web page where the user can receive a reward or instructions on how to receive it.  It is also possible to add promotional codes to the campaign, which will automatically be sent to winning users by e-mail. <br>  eCPM: Kiip says about $ 7- $ 50 (for some developers), but judging by the reviews on average about $ 5. <br>  <a href="http://kiip.com/">Site</a> <br>  <a href="http://app.kiip.me/reward/demo/cheetos-rr%3Fapp%3Dmegajump">Test demo</a> <br>  <u>Opinion:</u> An unusual advertising system, but not for the Russian market.  It is interesting to use it as a reward for stimulation when you receive Achievement. <br><br><br><h1>  Vungle (games and applications) </h1><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage3/7ce/be1/fb5/7cebe1fb56e3cbf18308a0a50885bd8d.jpeg"><br>  Advertising network specializing in advertising videos in applications and games.  The developer receives payment for viewing by the user 12s from a 15-second video. <br>  Advertising is played without constant reloading (like on youtube) or some kind of buffering, and is immediately preloaded at startup and stored in the cache. <br>  Advertisers: For advertising through this system, you will not have to record the commercial yourself.  It is enough to leave a request and indicate the main points that I would like to highlight in your application, as well as choose a voice.  The only limitation is the language for recording video, so far only English. <br>  The minimum advertising budget is $ 10, although the bid can be assigned on its own for installation (CPI) or viewing (CPV). <br>  When registering, you must carefully specify the type of account, since the advertiser and publisher have the functions presented in the control panel that are completely different. <br>  <a href="http://vungle.com/">Site</a> <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/l20OWAOpYyI%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700021,15700186,15700191,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhgSE5Dlxd5dI3_7t4dvlhXLfu1g6Q" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  eCPM: About $ 2-6 <br>  Withdrawal: bank transfer / paypal / checks.  The minimum withdrawal amount is $ 1000 for a bank transfer, $ 50 for the rest. <br>  To receive payments, you will have to fill out 2 forms (contact information and amount, as well as a tax form W-8/9 and send it to Vungle by email). <br>  <u>Opinion:</u> An excellent advertising system as an alternative to various banners, because the fascinating game teaser is much easier to interest a potential user.  It is also convenient to use video viewing as a source of additional currency for the user. <br><br><h1>  Chartboost (games only) </h1><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage3/d0b/eea/ea1/d0beeaea12d40a9fe981a4ee82c7118b.jpg"><br>  Advertising system, offering publishers full-screen banners with pay for installation.  Settings can increase the minimum value of the CPI, and if necessary, cut off advertising of low-budget companies (the default is at least $ 0.5). <br>  Advertisers: To advertise your game, you can create your own full-screen banner.  The minimum daily budget for advertising is $ 100, the minimum CPI is $ 0.5. <br>  The bulk of the games advertised through Chartboost are games for children and teenagers. <br>  <a href="https://www.chartboost.com/">Site</a> <br>  <u>Opinion:</u> The system looks good for advertising its applications, attracts the minimum price of one installation &lt;$ 1, while in other systems $ 1 is the very minimum.  Our experience with chartboost is $ 12 over several months, eCMP was $ 1- $ 2.5, with 80,000 runs / day and 6,000 application installations and 400 to 2,000 impressions.  After 2 weeks the profit fell to zero and never rose again.  But this is only for the Russian market.  On the western sites about this system are mostly positive reviews about consistently high eCMP. <br><br><h1>  RevMob (games only) </h1><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage3/197/dc9/532/197dc9532ecae399dbb4b90bc60bb11a.jpg"><br>  Offers mostly fullscreen ads.  The network is similar to Chartboost, which places a banner with only one phrase ‚ÄúGet a FREE game‚Äù on a gradient background leading to various free games.  It is also possible to place the ‚ÄúMore games‚Äù link directing the user to the download page of the advertised mobile application.  Payment to the developer goes for the transition and installation of the application. <br>  For greater flexibility of advertising when using the system on older devices, the use of a standard dialog with a message about downloading the game is also provided. <br>  Advertisers: When advertising your game through this system, the recommended minimum bid for the installation is $ 1.5, but there is an opportunity to do less, because the payment is charged according to the bid not for the install, but for each click on the advertisement. <br>  <a href="https://www.revmobmobileadnetwork.com/">Site</a> <br>  An example of an advertising banner: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage3/7ce/cb0/636/7cecb0636dfbd9b6447364fde49d21b1.png"><br><br>  eCPM: $ 5- $ 7 <br>  Withdrawal: bank transfer / paypal / payoneer card.  The minimum amount for a bank transfer transaction is $ 250, the rest of the system - $ 50. <br>  <u>Opinion:</u> Judging by the reviews, the link ‚ÄúMore Games‚Äù is quite popular and its use has a good return on eCPM. <br><br><h1>  TapJoy (games and applications) </h1><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage3/a8a/1d6/0ed/a8a1d60ed854cf478b24b58bf72503fb.jpg"><br>  Another advertising system, representing the usual banner advertising with standard formats (320x50, 640x100, etc.).  There is also the possibility of displaying full-screen banners and video ads.  But the most interesting, in our opinion, is the Offer Wall (Wall with offers), through which the user gets the opportunity to earn the internal currency in the application or some other bonuses simply by completing tasks on this ‚Äúwall‚Äù (usually they are reduced to installing any application). <br>  Advertisers: Tapjoy offers paid installations with a minimum bid of $ 0.10 and a recommended daily budget of $ 500-1000.  It is also possible to advertise your application using a 15-30 second video and using the ‚Äúengagement fee‚Äù, indicating the actions that the user must perform to receive the reward (for example, install the game and reach the control point) and a minimum bid of $ 0.20. <br>  <a href="http://developers.tapjoy.com/">Site</a> <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/Lg2t5pIdVO8%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700021,15700186,15700191,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhjaV_KQf1Cu085bf2H8YAHwOoS1cQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  Withdrawal: bank transfer / paypal / checks.  The minimum amount for withdrawal is $ 250 for any method. <br>  <u>Opinion:</u> Our experience using tapjoy offer wall was expressed in the following indicators: Revenue: $ 3.62, eCPM: $ 1.67, CTR: 21.6%.  Total revenue for two months of use was about $ 50. <br><br><br><h1>  Pollfish (games and applications) </h1><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage3/e1a/4db/312/e1a4db312270c7b80536e5350d3bc1a8.jpg"><br><br>  Pollfish offers developers a fee for fully completed user surveys within the application.  Income for each survey passed by the player varies depending on the targeting of the survey, the required number of answers and the actual logic of the survey. <br>  For advertisers: for $ 65 (this is for 50 responses, the price varies depending on their number), you can make a survey among more than 5,000,000 application users with the integrated Pollfish SDK.  Survey settings are quite flexible. <br>  <a href="http://www.pollfish.com/">Site</a> <br>  <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details%3Fid%3Dcom.pollfish.demo">Demo version of the application for Android</a> <br>  Withdrawal of funds: paypal when accumulated on the balance of $ 30. <br>  <u>Opinion: The</u> advertising system, which appeared relatively recently, but has already managed to form a fairly large user base.  We are going to try in the near future as an alternative to video advertising. <br><br><br><h1>  AdMob (games and applications) </h1><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage3/8c9/c7c/851/8c9c7c851956818b016b76969a80985a.jpg"><br>  The famous Google advertising network, which allows you to create banner ads and place them on the screen.  It features a stable eCPM and pay per click.  Clicks from each country are estimated differently, as for example in the USA somewhere 0.7 - 0.11 $, and in Europe (Russia) an average of about $ 0.03.  Not only games, but also various goods and services are advertised through the network. <br>  It is also possible to integrate full-sized advertising, clicks on such advertising do not cost more, but the chance that the user clicks on such a banner is still higher. <br>  In addition, AdMob has special offers for developers, which they periodically send to the post office, a separate type of full-screen banner advertising only games and video ads. <br>  Advertisers: Through AdMob, you can also advertise your applications using custom banner ads and fairly flexible targeting. <br>  <a href="http://www.admob.com/">Site</a> <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/u-7uyuTxQ5E%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700021,15700186,15700191,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhj9BmkF-sFs3-LPCtV0PrvCdvdd4g" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  Withdrawal: bank transfer / paypal / checks.  The minimum amount to withdraw $ 50 for any method.  After reaching this amount, you can receive transfers and smaller amounts. <br>  <u>Opinion:</u> CPC for advertising offer fullscreen banners with games is $ 0.06.  AdMob firmly holds its position and does not cease to be one of the best tools for monetization developers of their applications.  This is especially true of games tied to content.  I do not think that in the near future we will abandon this system, since  this represents about 40% of total application revenue. <br>  In terms of advertising applications through this network, as practice has shown, this option does not suit us, investing small amounts of money several times to check for user engagement or boost installations.  It is much more profitable, for example, to invest the same money in installations and get guaranteed installations. <br>  We also experienced other ad networks like <a href="http://madvertise.com/home">Madvertise</a> , <a href="http://www.inner-active.com/">Inner-active</a> , <a href="http://www.mobfox.com/">Mobfox</a> .  Of these, we are still working only with the latter; we have not achieved any productive results with the rest. <br>  We use Mobfox as a good alternative for a variety of advertising banners and for users located in countries for which for some reason there are no ad banners AdMob. <br><br><h1>  As a bonus: Apptopia </h1><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage3/893/435/f01/893435f0125cf9ce429e4fbe354ea568.jpg"><br>  If after all, after having tried all the above-mentioned monetization methods for a long time and not only them, but you couldn‚Äôt make the game truly profitable, you can at least try to beat off the development costs.  This can help Apptopia, where you can put your (iOS / Android) application for sale, indicating the price you like.  But at the same time it should be remembered that all data on downloads and earnings will also become available to potential buyers. <br>  To start sales, it is not necessary to transfer the username / password to the system, you can only add Apptopia as a user in the Google Play or iTunes Connect control panels and pay $ 29 for placement in the system. <br>  <a href="http://www.apptopia.com/">Site</a> <br><br><br><br><h1>  Conclusion </h1><br>  If you have had experience using these systems or you know about any unusual advertising services that offer interesting types of monetization of mobile applications and games, do not hesitate and leave your comments below. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/192570/">https://habr.com/ru/post/192570/</a></p>
