      Chances are that these were exactly the images.  Cheerful and stylish, humorous or enchanting.  Which images attract users best and affect conversions?  We will tell about it further. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h4>  Emotion picture </h4><br>  Marketers know a lot about the emotional presentation of images and videos.  Thanks to them, you can influence the impulse purchases.  Shopping based on momentary affection, admiration. <br><br>  Remember the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DKDUh_8UfQgA">commercial</a> from ‚ÄúLacoste‚Äù about the first kiss?  Yes, even such intimate moments are used as ‚Äúemotional hooks‚Äù.  In the same way, you need to present positive images on your website that will cause interest and the kindest emotions and memories to visitors.  So the audience will remember your site. <br><br>  Your task is to offer such images that will give the audience a good mood, a first perception and a desire to buy a product / service.  In addition, it is known that joyful people better perceive information, better go to contact. <br><br>  Let's look at an online store that uses funny images for their products. <br><br>  Clothing for mini dogs from the <a href="http://doggycouture.com.ua/clother-for-dog">online store DoggyCouture:</a> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/be5/640/1de/be56401de6b048ceb566124c6b08bd29.jpg"><br><br>  Agree that the owners of such cute creatures immediately want to dress up their darling. <br><br>  In general, two ‚Äúhot‚Äù topics for a female audience are children and animals.  It is quite easy to affect sales due to emotional images.  And in combination with a successful copyright the result is 100%. <br><br>  Yes, by the way, in the photo we see the goods in action.  I think you know that this is a very competent way to present your product.  Imagine how all these products would look if they were not on dogs.  Horror, in my opinion. <br><br>  And so proposes to organize a bachelor party wedding agency " <a href="http://yanaevent.com.ua/uslugi/organizatsiya-svadeb/devichnik-malchishnik/organizatsiya-malchishnika.html">Yana Event</a> ": <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/821/72b/404/82172b40419b4336a9ead7e550e7c82f.jpg"><br><br>  In this image we see the joy of friends from the upcoming event in the life of one of them, and even there is a certain thrill of the future husband.  The bachelor party is a great opportunity to meet with friends on the eve of the wedding and celebrate the acquisition of a new status. <br><br>  This photo perfectly conveys emotions.  A potential client "catches" these emotions, feels the necessary feelings and reaches for the button "Order a bachelor party." <br><br>  Yes, by the way, do not forget that site visitors appreciate real photos much more than those found on the Internet.  Also posted on ten more sites with similar topics.  If you can make your own, unique, high-quality image - be sure to do it. <br><br>  <i>Article in topic - <a href="http://boosta.ru/ab-testirovanie/cases/10-uspeshnyx-kejsov-ab-testirovaniya/">10 successful cases A / B testing</a></i> <br><br><h4>  Image quality </h4><br>  If you offer quality goods, let the images of your online store confirm this.  It is unlikely that you will be able to delay the user with a mediocre picture quality so that he also chooses something from the offer. <br><br>  This is how the famous Kharkov photographer Dmitry Lysenko offers his services. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/613/b79/c02/613b79c025cb446090c92ea8803ef137.jpg"><br><br>  Such different, high-quality and emotional images confirm the skill of the photographer, who can perform the most diverse shots. <br><br>  And with the help of the site, American photographer Peter Hurley offers his services, among whose clients are world-famous corporations such as Microsoft, Colgate, Revlon, etc. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/14a/5af/595/14a5af59514c47cdbf82010a98a797f7.png"><br><br>  In addition to the quality of the proposed photos, we can note how well the photographer owns his skill and clearly captures the emotions of each person with whom he works.  This is another happy confirms his competence.  One image, instead of a thousand words. <br><br>  <i>Article in the topic - <a href="http://boosta.ru/ab-testirovanie/cases/6-kejsov-uvelicheniya-konversii-ot-kompanii-fiverr/">6 cases of increasing the conversion from the company Fiverr</a></i> <br><br><h4>  Act </h4><br>  Popular reception of all the "sharks" of the catering industry. <br><br>  For example, if you are representing a confectionery establishment - put a picture in action on the main page of your online store, show the process of making chocolates, as Lvivska meisternya popular in Ukraine does to chocolate. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ff4/9df/9f2/ff49df9f2fa0442181c9b2d650b74c09.jpg"><br><br>  It is very important to show ‚Äúproduct face‚Äù.  It's one thing when you write what cool products you have, how they will help the client.  Another thing is when you show it.  Looking through these images, a potential client sees the end result of his activity, imagines himself in the place of the heroes of these photos. <br><br>  Believe me, this affects people's behavior. <br>  <i>Article in the topic - <a href="http://boosta.ru/ab-testirovanie/advice/kak-uvelichit-konversiyu-sajta-s-pomoshhyu-izobrazhenij-6-sposobov/">How to increase website conversion using images - 6 tips based on successful cases</a></i> <br><br><h4>  Faces happy customers </h4><br>  All successful websites should remember this simple and effective method of ‚ÄúPersons of happy customers‚Äù.  How does this work?  Show to potential customers the happy faces of real customers who have already used your product.  This will work very well on the reviews page.  So you can increase the level of confidence in your products, and at the same time, the conversion. <br><br>  So the faces of happy customers are presented by photographer Max Verona: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ed0/bd3/a05/ed0bd3a052a54fda800a4963f8088ee8.jpg"><br><br>  In addition, do not forget about the specifics of the proposal.  So, if this is a wedding photo session, then reviews of grateful clients will ‚Äúwork‚Äù by 100%.  If you make cakes to order, then it is good to combine reviews in the online store with offline tastings, participation in TV projects and of course, the good old word of mouth. <br><br>  This is how the faces of happy customers are presented by a creative team of specialists in creating advertising videos ‚ÄúDemoduck‚Äù <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/fbe/414/dea/fbe414dea8524cfebdc11e1f347fb249.png"><br><br>  As we can see from the reviews, customers are very grateful to the Demoduck team for their professionalism and satisfied with the results of their work.  Such a marketing move will undoubtedly add confidence to potential customers. <br><br>  By the way, if you read the book ‚ÄúThe Psychology of Persuasion‚Äù by Robert Cialdini (I advise everyone to read it, if you have not had time yet), then you should be familiar with the principle of social proof.  The use of feedback is an example of this principle.  Social evidence is a very powerful device for convincing people.  He worked 50 years ago, he works now.  I think that it will work forever. <br><br>  Advice - when using people of happy customers, try to make them match your target audience.  Roughly speaking, if you sell some goods to young mothers, then the reviews should be from this segment of buyers.  And if your target audience is people aged, then the photos should be people of the appropriate age.  This small life hack will further strengthen the influence of feedback on the behavior of potential customers. <br><br>  <i>Article in the topic - <a href="http://boosta.ru/ab-testirovanie/advice/kak-uvelichit-konversiyu-30-korotkix-sovetov-dlya-internet-marketologov/">How to increase conversion - 30 short tips for internet marketers</a></i> <br><br><h4>  Expanding boundaries </h4><br>  Modern technologies of web-design allow experimenting in terms of the presentation of images.  Thus, the Due maternity online store offered something unique to future moms.  With the help of ‚Äúdynamic image‚Äù technology, the product was presented from all sides, i.e.  rotated 360 degrees.  Thanks to this innovation, the conversion rate increased by 27%. <br><br>  Presentation of goods from the Due maternity online store: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/927/8f5/9a0/9278f59a052f4c39a2476c7178a8096c.jpg"><br><br>  The use of such technologies allows you to stand out among competitors and show your product from all possible sides.  Accordingly, dispel all doubts about the product, which in the future, as shown in this example, may affect the conversion.  Now this technique is used by many online stores.  Of course, this is expensive, and here you have to relate the costs to the potential impact on conversion and sales. <br><br>  How else is it possible to go beyond the boundaries and achieve an increase in conversion, consider using the case from Brookdale.  This company offers different accommodation options for seniors.  The problem of the site was that the conversion was minimal due to the lack of graphics and reviews on the main page. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/136/a2d/2a4/136a2d2a41a24a2b9a228abf8b5d29fc.jpg"><br><br>  To solve the problem, A / B testing was conducted, during which two variants of pages were shown to users - with a video clip and with photos. <br><br>  The video version told the clients about how they were lucky to get into the Brookdale company, and the second version was a photo image of a satisfied client <br><br>  Test results showed that the photo version works best.  The conversion was 3.92% instead of 0.85%, which amounted to more than 100 thousand dollars of additional income. <br><br>  The victory of this option was connected with the peculiarities of the target audience. The target audience of the company is people of small wealth who, for the most part, did not have fast Internet, besides, the majority of elderly people were frightened by the automatic launch of the video.  The result - they just left the site. <br>  <i>Article in the topic - <a href="http://boosta.ru/web-analytics/oni-pomogut-najti-vsex-ubijc-konversii-10-otchyotov-v-google-analytics/">They will help you find all the "killers" of conversion - 10 reports in Google Analytics</a></i> <br><br><h4>  You advertise your customers, not yourself </h4><br>  What is meant? <br><br>  For better conversion, you need to improve the art of selecting images of your online store.  Show your customers that they are on the right track to make them comfortable.  Show how great it is to be among your customers, how tasty, profitable, prestigious it is.  And they will not buy from competitors, but from you. <br><br>  It is the right image with the participation of your satisfied customers that will add confidence to your online store.  And more trust means more sales. <br><br>  This is exactly what the Ukrainian online store for women's clothing "Fasonata" does.  These guys made a contest, which was held in the popular social network "VKontakte", during which the clients themselves laid out photos in the company's dresses. <br><br>  Advertising of clothes with the participation of clients from the online store "Fasonata": <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/0f0/6e5/bd8/0f06e5bd8360488cb84e5ff7665fe787.jpg"><br><br>  As we know from the team "Fasonata" sales thanks to the competition increased by a third.  Girls ordered exactly those dresses that are seen in the photos. <br><br>  How to attract new customers with the help of existing customers will be considered on the example of GoPro's active work.  The company is engaged in the sale of action cameras and accessories.  Initially, the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe creator of the company was to share joyful emotions with friends while surfing through video. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/80f/0cd/10c/80f0cd10c5e5484ab3d6ac244c12b8de.jpg"><br><br>  Subsequently, the clients themselves began to shoot the same exciting videos and upload them to the company's channel. <br><br>  Thus, it turns out that the creator's idea every day and every minute inspires real customers to ‚Äúshare‚Äù emotions and thus the online store regularly updates its video content, attracting all new people to shopping for action cameras. <br><br>  People who do not even think about buying a GoPro, watch cool videos and dream themselves to be in this video.  They begin to present themselves in this place.  And it is precisely at this moment that they have a strong desire to receive this camera in order to later shoot the same video.  Checked on yourself, so to speak. <br><br>  In conclusion of the article we want to say that we did not discover secrets about which no one knew.  We talked about simple things that can be used to increase conversion.  And all this is confirmed by real examples. <br><br>  They say that the one who knows knows, and the one who does, acts.  Know and act!
