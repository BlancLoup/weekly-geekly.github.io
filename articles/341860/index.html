Run Android version and where to get the first customers</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Recently I wrote an article about my startup here and saw quite a lot of interest in the project (traffic to the site has increased quite significantly).  Therefore, I decided to keep on Habr√© a blog about the development of the project and everything that happens to it.  From programming to marketing. <br><br>  The first article can be read <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/post/341532/">here</a> (what it generally is, etc.). <br><br>  Who is too lazy to read the previous post, in brief: uSpeech solves the problem of the development of vocabulary and cleaning the Russian language with our users.

      <b>And today we have a historical moment: launching the Android version for testing to the masses!</b> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h3>  Running a test Android application </h3><br>  Since the last post, something has changed, namely: <br><br>  <b>1. The server has been redone and now everything is working</b> <br>  Before we spoke at GoTech, VKontakte decided to change the API and now pumping outgoing messages was no longer available using the messages.get method.  Only through the story in the dialogues.  Therefore, nothing worked on the forum, but it was repaired just now. <br><br>  <b>2. Several people bought a pre-subscription for the annual use of the service.</b> <br>  Now it is 90% cheaper than at the time of the official launch.  Of course, test versions are completely free.  And it gave us another ton of confidence in what we do, since people buy a product before they can even see it, touch it, play around. <br><br>  <b>3. Set up lists</b> <br>  It was decided to make lists of words-synonyms for replacement for now manually, because automatic pumping gives an absolutely unpredictable result (because the context plays a big role).  In the future - machine learning and project automation.  Words - parasites likewise lie in the list. <br><br>  They checked on themselves and <s>drank for three days and</s> decided to give the rest a try.  The creator (that is, me) likes everything, the result really is.  But the creator is the creator, and I want to hear the opinion of the first users. <br><br>  I already managed to earn 17 points :) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/lh/nq/fn/lhnqfniaqkv4wuxmdxncl5j96ro.jpeg" alt="image"><br><br><h3>  Where to get the first customers </h3><br>  Even before the launch, we tried to check the demand and placed ‚ÄúLike‚Äù widgets on the site VKontakte on our website.  These buttons were both on the main page of the site, and on separate pages of Android and iOS versions.  It was by likes that we found our very first followers. <br><br>  As soon as we made the test version of Android available for download, we took a list of those who clicked ‚ÄúI like‚Äù and wrote them personal messages that the version can be downloaded.  The result was not long in coming and almost every one of these people downloaded the application.  Moreover, many people decided to talk with us and offered their ideas <i>(or wrote that something doesn‚Äôt work for them (who doesn‚Äôt happen with them? :))</i> . <br><br>  So, the very first customers can be obtained using this button on your site: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/2d/nk/aq/2dnkaq7kqugpm5jtjaxnsv8hiuq.jpeg"><br><br>  <b>PS</b> If you are interested in learning more about everything that is happening and what we are doing at a particular point in time, read our <a href="https://vk.com/uspeechpage">blog</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/341860/">https://habr.com/ru/post/341860/</a></p>
