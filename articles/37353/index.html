  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Google and the velvet revolution in software development</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Google is a company with a non-standard approach.  For example, Google has its own file system, and ordinary computer components are used as servers.  But, at the same time, the now widely known ‚Äúempty‚Äù appearance of the Google homepage is not a thoughtful decision, but a necessary necessity.  The creators of the search engine simply did not know HTML, so they had to make the page very simple.  Initially, there was not even a ‚ÄúSubmit‚Äù button; in order to find something, you had to press Enter on the keyboard. <br><br>  Nevertheless, now Google is the first candidate for the position of software developer number 1. This is despite the fact that the company is one of the largest customers of AMD and seriously thinks about designing iron for its own needs. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The trend that Google has launched and is actively promoting is browser software.  Programs for which you do not need to download the distribution and install it, just go to the site.  Simple and ingenious.

      Perhaps the main reason for the success of Google services is its focus on user needs and the highest quality of execution. <br><br>  Look at the mega-popular <a href="http://gmail.com/">Gmail</a> , which excited the Internet users for those times with a huge mailbox volume - as much as 2 gigabytes.  Now the boxes have become larger, competitors offer the same or large volumes, but Google and then all jumped.  After all, Gmail is actually a browser software that adapts to the needs of the user. <br><br>  And <a href="http://docs.google.com/">Google Documents</a> ?  A fully ready-to-use office suite with the ability to work together (you even see in real time how someone to whom you gave access makes changes to the document) (it's worth noting, of course, that this is not a complete replacement for the Microsoft office suite, but perhaps the best what is for these needs on the Internet). <br><br>  To organize such a service using standard tools you will need at least to buy the appropriate software, install and configure the server.  And here - just enough to register. <br><br>  It is worth noting that the main claim against Google‚Äôs browser software has not been confirmed.  We are talking about the pursuit of monopolistic seizure of the industry and total control over users, up to the mandatory collection of passport data when registering with the services. <br><br>  Such statements sound quite unprofessional, and besides, they are refuted by actual events - Google, for example, has reduced the storage time of search queries and user cookies.  This confirms that the main task is to provide popular, convenient, innovative services designed to bring the IT industry to a new level. <br><br>  Why the velvet revolution?  A lot of IT-market monsters supported the Google initiative.  True, no one says this out loud.  For example, a serious drawback of browser software is that it stops working if the Internet connection is lost. <br><br>  Adobe has already made <a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/air/">Adobe Air</a> , solving this problem, a lot of other giants of the software market are developing similar solutions.  This indicates the scale of the trend.  Market leaders realized that very soon the Internet will be everywhere (due to the development and cheapening of mobile access), and traffic will be free (or conditionally free), so it‚Äôs easier and more convenient to offer users browser software. <br><br>  Of course, at the moment the situation with high-quality and affordable Internet connection is not fully resolved - in some regions there are still problems.  But trends in the provider services market promise to fix this in the near future. <br><br>  Today there are a lot of services working in the browser.  These are photo editing, file conversion, slideshow creation and many others. <br><br>  The tendency was picked up not only by companies, but also by potential customers. <br><br>  According to company Aytrek VSK ( <a href="http://www.itrack.ru/">www.itrack.ru</a> ): <br><br><blockquote>  <i>‚ÄúOver the past year, the number of requests for the development of intra-corporate systems based on lightweight web technologies has tripled.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>Increased customer awareness.</i>  <i>Now they firmly believe that to ensure the joint work of the offices at the expense of browser software, it is possible to get the functions of a CRM or ERP system at a lower cost than with the introduction of traditional systems.</i>  <i>In this case, the cost of iron will be minimal, and the functionality can be increased in unlimited amounts.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>Even taking into account the possible increase in costs for provider services and network upgrades, such solutions ultimately prove to be much more cost effective.</i>  <i>And due to the high level of usability and understandable interface, the transition to a new software product occurs as soon as possible and does not reduce the level of performance. ‚Äù</i> </blockquote><br><br>  Should we say that by porting their software (within reasonable limits of course) for the web, companies increase the popularity of their programs? <br><br>  It is possible that sometime Microsoft will also release a ‚Äúlight version‚Äù of Windows for browsers. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/37353/">https://habr.com/ru/post/37353/</a></p>
