      Practically in any on-line community, a kind of ‚Äúpolitical corner‚Äù arises, a place where people argue, discuss or curse the authorities, politicians and life.  The idea is to collect all these discussions and disputes in one place.  Make a ‚ÄúHabrahabr about politics‚Äù summarizing the experience of LJ, WikiLeaks and MMORPG involvement methods.  The most important task is to create a new channel of communication between active representatives of society and those who make decisions.  And start with the game. <br><br>  Cool?  Then a weak stream of consciousness awaits you. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  Story </h4><br>  <a href="http://www.vedomosti.ru/smartmoney/article/2009/04/20/10982">This article</a> served as a push.  In the first edition, I conditionally called my idea ‚Äú <b>killer democracy</b> ‚Äù.  It was assumed that a site would be created on which people would give a black or white mark against politicians or sensational criminals.  One of the high-profile crimes occurred right before my eyes, the speech about <a href="http://www.echo.msk.ru/news/606934-echo.html">Alexander Maz,</a> who shot down a woman on the pedestrian ‚Äúisland of security‚Äù.  However, I understood that, on the one hand, the concept itself was defiantly tough, on the other hand I did not see people who would be involved in work with topics on the verge of a foul.  For two years the situation has changed a lot.  Bulk Navalny unwound, appeared Rospil.  ‚ÄúPrimorsky partisans‚Äù flashed and went out, ‚ÄúArab revolutions‚Äù showed the real value of ‚Äústability‚Äù without the possibility of change.  Discussion of the Skolkovo Foundation site showed that a whole stratum of constructive-minded people with an active lifestyle had emerged.  And the authorities, even ineptly, but are looking for reasons for interaction.  For such people, publish a description of the project " <b>Enemies of the People</b> " or if it is completely neutral " <b>Voice of the People</b> " <br><br>  The project synthesizes proven methods of MMORPG, Web 2.0 and social networks in a highly sought-after, but surprisingly empty niche of "electronic policy".  Next comes pure <i>vision</i> . <br><hr><br><h4>  Description </h4><br>  Externally, the project is done with humor and laid-back gags, inside it works like a game, but in fact it is a real political platform for generation i (internet). <br><br>  This is a site.  Closed community.  " <b>Citizens</b> " or " <b>voters</b> " are registered on the site.  Citizens can unite in movements (parties, guilds).  The main goal is to identify "enemies of the people" and "friends of the people", as well as "victory in the elections." <br><br>  Absolutely any character can be declared an enemy or a friend of a people, from Miki-Maus to a public politician.  However, in order for a character to become such, he must pass a difficult path in the ratings with a plus or minus sign, i.e.  to be really famous. <br><br>  Each project participant can make a career (leveling) At the initial level, the task of a citizen is to participate in discussions (rating for comments) and recruit new members (network marketing).  The higher the rating, the more opportunities the citizen opens up.  For example, he may become a lawyer or a prosecutor and accordingly bring new characters to the court. <br><br>  An important feature of the project is that all participants are required to vote in the monthly / annual elections.  If they do not vote and do not show "civil" activity, they gradually lose all their earned opportunities (except for officially appointed posts) <br><br>  Algorithms of ratings need to think about, as an example of revealing the idea give one of the options.  (In this place my thought spreads so much on the tree that I rewrite a piece of text after each reading). <br><br>  From the main page we have access to the three top tapes - <b>Enemies</b> , <b>Friends</b> and <b>Debates</b> , as well as a separate chart of "well-known" characters - <b>Glavchart</b> (such as the president or Mikhalkov). <br><br>  Debate is a daily feed where articles from party tapes go.  Enemies and Friends are the charts, more precisely, the minus and plus tail of the ribbon, where new characters are received, as well as fresh accusatory and laudatory posts about well-known characters from the Glavchart.  Top bad and good characters are displayed on a monthly vote.  Every citizen of the people gets the opportunity to vote for each candidate who gets into the tape once a month by putting him <b>+</b> or <b>-</b> .  Winners of the monthly charts fit into the main page.  Very quickly, popular characters will move to the main page, its supreme meaning is the monitoring of public sentiment. <br><br>  New candidates get into the discussion thread according to the Habr principle - rated from party blogs.  Also in the project are automatically created party blogs for each party (clan). <br><br>  Inside the party blog, only party members can vote, and the party leader can, by a strong-willed decision, establish access rules.  Either make it open to the Internet, or closed.  The head can also allow membership in other guilds or put a ban.  The head of the guild assigns a hierarchy of access rights.  Exit from the guild is a voluntary matter, various conditions can be imposed on the entrance to the guild (for example, a certain rating or approval of party members with a certain status).  In addition to enemies / friends in blogs you can publish any information. <br><br>  Voting is a purely voluntary matter.  By the principle of social networks, you can keep a list of candidates in an open profile, the fate of which you want to influence with the votes, which is also a reminder. <br><br>  For each citizen is listed the history of his transitions in the guild and obtaining status - a public record.  So we fight with spies and shifters.  (What a expanse for mathematical online sociology!) <br><br>  Any citizen who has reached a certain level gets the opportunity to write a lawyer or prosecutor‚Äôs posts on a character‚Äôs blog.  Higher level - create characters, even higher - create parties.  Recruits are engaged in the favorite business of all recruits - shit in the comments. <br><br>  The main intrigue of the project is the monthly party elections held, say, in the last weekend of the month.  This is an analogue of guild wars in the MMORPG (the most interesting who do not know).  Participation in the elections is voluntary, but a vote is put plus a rating that does not vote - a minus.  When leaving in a deep minus the participant can reach account freezing, this is clearing of ballast.  The election mobilizes all the skill in campaigning for their party and watering their opponents with mud to win voters over to their side.  Also all means of entertainment are used to attract passive voters.  Casino, blackjack ...? <br><br>  What gives victory in the election?  A set of intangible buns.  In essence, this is a battle for respect.  For example, for the top 3 parties, a band is allocated for political manifestos in proportion to their share in the vote.  Do you still remember the debate tape on the main page?  It is there.  Members of the winning party are given the opportunity to be marked with a special badge everywhere.  Also, the participants of the winner's party receive double the power of voting for the characters.  You can think of many interesting features, such as the appointment of the president, the supreme judge, the release of the order (like honorary statuses in Habr√©), etc. <br><br>  The ruling party does not receive any advantage in the next election, it maintains a balance of power.  Thus, in order to achieve the goal of declaring a friend or an enemy of a people, a group of participants has an incentive to maximally attract the sympathies of voters and win elections.  Virtual model of real democracy. <br><hr><br><h4>  Goals and all that </h4><br>  I can assume that the presence of the game component and the "social leveling" will lead to the rapid development of the project.  Unlike existing games, this project should connect the game, virtuality and reality and become a battery of real information from different sources.  The project can replace the chaotic LiveJournal, as well as become a warehouse of political information - such a crowdsourcing wiki and the Internet is a compromise.ru.  It should initially be designed and built to solve serious problems.  Perhaps it will appear the first serious online party.  The monthly voting results of thousands, and possibly millions of users (also colored with party affiliation) will be the most reliable indicator of public sentiment.  Newspapers will cite them, and top leaders will begin to read manifestos from blogs of top parties.  Mass experience of participation in the game democracy of young people and an apolitical office middle class will lead to the transformation of psychology. <br><br>  I believe that the goal of this project is inspiring enough to interest many people, therefore I support any discussion of the idea. <br><hr><br><h4>  Now about serious </h4><br>  Long before the publication of this post, I had a meeting with aliens who convinced me of my mission.  They do not want to intervene directly in the politics of earthlings, but they want to send in the right direction.  To this end, my casting on <a href="http://habrhabr.ru/">habrhabr.ru</a> was carried out and at the same time the rating calculation algorithm was changed to make it easier to take first place and implement the idea.  Perhaps especially odious characters from the ranking of enemies, aliens will incinerate with a blue ray.  But this is just my guess, this was not directly mentioned. <br><br>  I have already negotiated with some special services for project financing.  It is very convenient for them when all political dissidents are gathered in one place.  Particularly interested in the representatives of Arab countries.  Unfortunately, the CIA could not be interested because, according to them, they once agreed to finance Mark Zukenberg at $ 100 per user.  Now the US Congress is forced to adopt a law to reduce the budget deficit in order to pay under this contract. <br><br>  A project needs a strong team.  A lot of people ... a lot!  But no more than 50, because more simply does not fit in google apps. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/117678/">https://habr.com/ru/post/117678/</a></p>
