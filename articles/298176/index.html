    <blockquote>  But can personalization become overly personal? </blockquote><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Customers like to receive personalized offers that are based on their interests and purchase history, BUT they don‚Äôt like being closely watched for all their online activities.  And it hurts the business ... <br><br><h4>  1. Too private ... </h4><br>  The amount of personalized content must correspond to the stage of relationship with the client.  Therefore, sometimes the content becomes more annoying than personalized. <br><br>  <i>For example, one very large medical company tracked every stage of pregnancy of its clients by the date of their purchase and put clients on ‚Äúvery dumb‚Äù mailing lists.</i> <br><br>  As a result, this PR campaign turned into a nightmare and hurt the brand a lot. <br><br>  <b>Tip:</b> Send customers personal offers mixed with your standard ‚Äúfor all‚Äù mass mailing.  This will help customers not to feel the hunter‚Äôs target. <br><br><h4>  2. It's too early to get personal ... </h4><br>  Do not immediately use all that you have to make a super personal offer.  Such a pressure can frighten the client ... Especially when he is in the process of acquaintance with your brand. <br><br>  For the first letter, it will be quite enough to just add his name to the greeting.  <i>(Letters that do not contain the elementary name of the client in the greeting, are immediately sent to the trash).</i> <br><br>  In the next letter, this client can add a bit more personalization and dynamic tags. <br><br>  <b>Tip:</b> Wait until the client passes the stage of acquaintance with your company, then add personalized content to the letters, which is based on his behavior on your site. <br><br><h4>  3. Personalization based on rare requests ... </h4><br>  For example, a woman may look for children's things for a gift to a friend or someone from her family.  The fact that she was looking for a baby bottle on the Internet does not mean that she needs to be flooded with letters and banner advertising with an offer of baby food after 9 months. <br><br>  If someone enters a query 1-2 times - it can be a search for a gift or just curiosity.  If search queries continue and become more frequent, turn on your marketing to full. <br><br>  <b>Tip:</b> Segment your customers tightly to make sure you send the letter to the right customer at the right time. <br><br><h4>  4. Good offer, feed is lame ... </h4><br>  It is important that the client receives not just a good offer, but at the right time.  Essentially, content is what you offer.  And the context - when and where you offer it. <br><br>  In continuation of the theme of children's products, if a woman bought a child seat from you, <i>WHAT IS THE PROBABILITY, WHAT WILL IT NEED ONE MORE FOR IT?</i> <br><br>  Accordingly, the letter with the proposal of your new products in this category, it is likely to send in the basket. <br><br>  While the proposal of a children's rug in a few months will be quite appropriate. <br><br>  <b>Tip:</b> Do not use personalization simply because you can and you have the data.  Use it wisely. <br><br><h4>  5. Careful with geolocation ... </h4><br>  Using a client's geolocation is a great way to make a personal offer to him, but here it is important not to miss. <br><br>  If a client is looking for a place to eat in Chicago while he is on vacation there, and then returns home to New York, he shouldn‚Äôt send a selection of restaurants in Chicago anymore. <br><br>  Clients who continue to be bothered by such offers regularly write complaints on social networks, which harms your brand. <br><br>  <b>Tip:</b> Make sure your geo-targeting works correctly and is configured for the current client location.  Regularly update information.  Many services now allow you to determine the client's geolocation immediately at the moment of opening the letter and instantly insert the necessary content inside. <br><br><h4>  6. You are too many ... </h4><br>  Everything is good, that in moderation ... If you send the same letter to clients every month, but they do not open it and do not answer, <i>WHAT ARE THE CHANCES, WHAT IS IT EVERYTHING?</i> <br><br>  Before you send them something again, see if there was any activity on the client‚Äôs side in response to your numerous letters.  Filling them with letters will most likely lead to the fact that they unsubscribe and never return, than to what they will buy from you. <br><br>  <b>Tip:</b> Be sure to track customer activity on your site when you receive emails.  If they have not made their first purchase within 30 days - slow down.  Reduce the number of letters sent to them. <br><br><h4>  7. Do not get carried away with social networks ... </h4><br>  Have you had cases when you mark your geolocation on social networks, and you immediately begin to show advertisements of places near you? <br><br>  Using geo-targeting on social customer profiles is already more personal than tracking your site visits. <br><br><blockquote>  The client immediately has a logical question: ‚ÄúWhat else did my personal become public?‚Äù <br></blockquote><br>  <b>Tip:</b> Do not get carried away with advertising or personalized letters, which are based on activities in the social profiles of clients.  Always remember that you are trying to penetrate into a very personal, and nobody likes that. <br><br><h4>  8. Intrusive retargeting ... </h4><br>  The golden rule of retargeting: <i>STOP PERSECUTING THE CUSTOMER, IF HE DIDN'T BUY IN 30 DAYS!</i> <br><br>  Such a pursuit will most likely lead to the fact that the client will be angry with your brand and will never buy anything from you.  30 days is an ample period for a person to make a purchase decision.  If not, most likely, this is not your client and the further display of advertising does not make sense. <br><br>  If the customer did make a purchase, make sure that your ad banner is no longer chasing him.  Recheck your campaign settings. <br><br>  <b>Tip:</b> Carefully monitor the behavior of customers who show your ad in order to change the settings at the right moment or disable the banner that is not working. <br><br><h4>  REMEMBER, EVERYTHING IS THE LIMIT ... </h4><br>  Customers love personalization and always expect it from you.  But there is a very thin line between correct personalization and obsession ... do not lose it. <br><br>  The client should not feel as if you breathe him in the back, watch his every step. <br><br>  <i>Successes!</i> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/298176/">https://habr.com/ru/post/298176/</a></p>
