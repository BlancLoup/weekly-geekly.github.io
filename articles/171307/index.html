  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Microsoft Surface 2 RT - powerful, cool, controversial</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"> Tablets have a relatively long time came into use, replacing part of laptops and netbooks.  Such mobile gadgets are especially popular among young people, but even in the business sector for tablets, demand is only growing every year. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/fca/de8/1e5/fcade81e5c9433005e5f00f2c2dcbeda.jpg"><br><br>  If initially this category of devices was associated mainly with the iPad, then recently Apple‚Äôs share in the tablet market has been falling.  On the one hand, numerous cheap Android competitors are attacking, on the other hand, Windows models have begun to appear.  Among the latter, a special place is occupied by the Microsoft Surface line of tablets, which also seeks to take up its position in this market.  And today we will talk about one of these devices - Surface 2 RT. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  <font color="ff9c00">‚ñå</font> <font color="000000">TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS</font> </h2><br>  The Surface 2 tablet comes preloaded with the Windows RT 8.1 operating system ‚Äî an operating system that is optimized for thin and light computers.  The resolution of a 10.6-inch display is 1920x1080 pixels.  Inside it has a quad-core Tegra 4 processor with a clock speed of 1.9 GHz and a 72-core (sounds terrible) NVIDIA GeForce ULP video accelerator.  Other features include 2 GB of RAM and 32 GB of user memory (+ slot microSDXC).  Some Surface 2 tablet models: Surface 2 (AT &amp; T 4G LTE) and Surface 2 (4G) have built-in connectivity to mobile broadband networks, which you can use to connect to the Internet if the Wi-Fi network is not available.  In addition, a version with 64 GB of internal memory is sold.

From this black box with a sloping right side, a white box peeps out in which the tablet itself is located. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c4c/5be/e5c/c4c5bee5c1c4ef9e8c0d2e7510375767.jpg"><br><br>  On the back of the package are the main advantages of the tablet in three languages ‚Äã‚Äã(English, German and Italian) and license information with a guarantee.  On the side is the memory version. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/52d/6ab/7d1/52d6ab7d12af71c54e5818b4058b280b.jpg"><br><br>  Next we are greeted by the bright side of the box with the lonely inscription '' Surface ''. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d69/2e3/551/d692e35514761b6661db7299753bd3ee.jpg"><br><br>  The box opens like a huge book.  Inside the tablet lies neatly and charging to it. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/10f/e8a/083/10fe8a083f5660a8c4a3b5effccc93d8.jpg"><br><br>  There are also booklets and some bonuses.  When you buy a Surface 2 tablet, the user gets 200 GB of space in the OneDrive cloud storage for a period of two years (there is a promotional code for activation).  And besides, Skype gives an annual subscription, namely unlimited free calls to landline numbers in 60 countries ( <i>Russia is on the list, despite sanctions</i> ), unlimited Internet connection via Skype Wi-Fi in public Wi-Fi access areas (more million worldwide), technical support in the chat format, and of course the disconnection of third-party advertising in Skype.  Please note: a free Skype subscription is available for 90 days from the date of purchase of Surface 2. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/7c4/f3b/cc6/7c4f3bcc6a7847258bcc9b6490cfac35.jpg"><br><br>  The power supply as with other similar devices, only with a color sticker Windows 8. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/4c6/c76/6fc/4c6c766fc51659b86e6370a5e44e7197.jpg"><br><br>  Output current - 2A. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/426/c94/633/426c94633e088cda53475ab756ce6c29.jpg"><br><br>  There is no USB cable or headset. <br><br><h2>  <font color="808080">‚ñå</font> <font color="000000">KEYBOARD</font> </h2><br>  Together with the tablet, I also ordered a Type Cover 2 keyboard (it is purchased separately and is not included in the package).  The box she is certainly not as cool as the main device, but it looks decent.  The accessory is simply attached to the cardboard frame and tucked into transparent plastic. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/62e/478/9bf/62e4789bf1831fa638c368338a60450e.jpg"><br><br>  The keyboard material is pleasant to the touch, it looks more like a velvet, rough fabric, but most likely it is fine textured hard plastic.  Only here the keyboard collects dust very well ... Like the Smart Cover for iPad or Galaxy Tab, Type Cover 2 not only protects the device‚Äôs screen, but also takes it out of sleep mode (when opened) or, on the contrary, puts the device into sleep mode (when closing). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ee2/a3f/e20/ee2a3fe20225444ba461b84f08558ea6.jpg"><br><br>  The keyboard module has standard keys, as well as support for combining them for typical tasks, and a touchpad with recognition of various gestures.  The keys have a good move and quite thoughtful arrangement.  Only the lack of the PrintScreen key and too little Enter (the still one of the popular buttons ;-)) are distressing.  And, perhaps, one more minus - a small touchpad area (and the place allows you to increase it, a strange solution), as well as its material.  The fact is that it does not visually stand out, and you will not feel its tactile border.  On the one hand it is beautiful, but from a practical point of view it is not always uncomfortable.  Surprisingly, the touchpad works well and quickly recognizes scrolling or scaling. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/9e0/c88/e10/9e0c88e1013e4b5ecc2244b62af365ed.jpg"><br><br>  The keyboard is attached to the tablet with a magnet: it is enough to bring them together by 5-7 mm - and they will literally be attracted to each other, accompanying the process with a characteristic click. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d83/409/7ed/d834097ed7b136f9b891e408f6006511.jpg"><br><br>  Microsoft for the new generation of tablets has significantly improved Type Cover 2, it has become even thinner, now the thickness is only 5 mm.  In addition, added and built-in key illumination.  Moreover, this backlight is adaptive (there is a proximity sensor)!  Everything is very simple - they presented a hand to it, and it caught fire, well, or you can just press any key. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/9d1/8d2/9b3/9d18d29b3ce31a8da44e9b8cade348c8.jpg"><br><br>  An interesting point: Type Cover 2 can be wrapped on the back side of the case, and it will stop working until you bring it back - the intelligent accessory determines not only the connection, but also the orientation in order to avoid accidental clicks.  But still, the feeling of the keys under the fingers is not the most familiar, it is very confusing. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/350/2f6/d39/3502f6d398520fd6b0759b4e00776ca6.jpg"><br><br>  Since the device was ordered from the United States, of course, on Type Cover 2 only English letters.  There are three solutions to the problem: do laser engraving, draw the letter itself with a felt-tip pen, or stickers.  Oh, or do nothing at all and leave only the Latin alphabet.  I decided to go the first way and for 500 rubles in local service in 10 minutes inflicted Russian letters.  Externally, the printed letters look exactly the same as their English, the backlight also works on Russian letters.  What happened - you can see in the photo above.  Well, now let's quickly move on to our device. <br><br><h2>  <font color="ffd800">‚ñå</font> <font color="000000">DESIGN, DIMENSIONS, CONTROL ELEMENTS</font> </h2><br>  The tablet looks strictly and massively, but pretty.  The edges are not sleek and beveled, as is now fashionable, but rather clearly defined.  Because of this, the device looks a bit angular.  The display is surrounded by wide fields, for which it is convenient to hold the tablet, not obscuring the screen. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/490/ff2/3df/490ff23df0075b1d41666c51385e6199.jpg"><br><br>  At the top is the front camera, front microphone, light sensor and indicator of the working camera. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/cac/444/f1b/cac444f1b5910ad3e5d10914cd6b10c0.jpg"><br><br>  On the front surface, only the Windows 8 logo stands out, which is very interestingly beaten in the form of faces.  Touch button, by clicking on which, you can always get to the OS main menu. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a9a/c12/27a/a9ac1227a5712feb546649d70267a0b3.jpg"><br><br>  The Surface 2 RT case is made of magnesium alloy (Microsoft itself calls it <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/surface/ru-ru/surface-with-windows-rt/vapormg">VaporMg</a> ), which is lighter and stronger than aluminum, and has only a plastic insert on the upper end in order to skip the WiFi signal.  Behind the face of the tablet beveled, tapering to the back side, but without smoothing.  That is, the back surface is as straight as the front, however, it is smaller in area. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/928/a52/ce7/928a52ce7350bfe34e80d4811cdad8fc.jpg"><br><br>  On the plastic insert is placed the rear camera and microphone. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f29/a88/36d/f29a8836de27493570a9867fd7b7bf07.jpg"><br><br>  The most important feature of the tablet is of course the stand!  The presence of it saves you from having to buy a docking station or look for some other ways of fixed vertical installation of the tablet.  True, this metal plate occupies half of the device (although it does not protrude at all), but it can bend back to two positions.  All this construction is held very firmly, there is no feeling that now something will work out or change to another mode. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/dae/72a/861/dae72a86197b60eec2ce8138346d064c.jpg"><br><br>  One position is ideal for typing on the table, and the other for typing on your lap.  The only, though very significant, drawback of the stand is the impossibility of adjusting its angle of inclination.  But experts from Microsoft have provided angles at which it is comfortable to work with the tablet. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/488/4c7/f73/4884c7f7378a228d00f8ceefc2f8b880.jpg"><br><br>  For easy poddevaniya stand on the left side of the tablet there is a small ledge.  And the microSDXC slot is located behind the stand. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e35/3ac/a67/e353aca6740c8280ad53a7ab61e44ec6.jpg"><br><br>  On the right side, we see one of two speakers, a microHDMI connector and a full USB 3.0 port.  As for the USB-port, external hard drives and flash drives are quietly connected to it, and also other gadgets can be charged through it.  Adapters and cables for connecting the Surface 2 tablet to an HDTV are sold separately and are not included in the package. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/648/2b3/6de/6482b36de1d1860d8981fd861731cab6.jpg"><br><br>  Below is the connector for the charger, which uses a magnetic lock, and not the physical fastening of the connector. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e64/40c/be4/e6440cbe41a54172cb189618e9c355af.jpg"><br><br>  The 5-pin connector is connected to the device (in this case, it is even appropriate to use a ‚Äúsnap‚Äù) with a magnet, and no matter what polarity.  After connection the white LED lights up.  In the photo it does not burn, because there was no outlet for connection. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c7b/319/809/c7b3198097c2e9c157438532cf898e3c.jpg"><br><br>  On the left side is the second speaker, volume rocker and a 3.5 mm audio jack.  The sound quality itself is good, reproduces clean, but not very loud.  To watch the show at home or on a trip is fine. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d50/d18/b6c/d50d18b6cfe5ef618356e765d61ed624.jpg"><br><br>  By the way, special ‚Äúears‚Äù have already appeared on <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1463948377/ears-for-the-surface-tablets">Kickstarter</a> , which are worn on the corners of Surface, amplify the sound by ten decibels, but do not require additional power.  They simply prevent the sound from scattering and direct it directly to the user.  I tried to just hold the speakers with my hands and, indeed, the volume increased slightly.  So a pretty useful accessory for Surface owners! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/fa5/f44/a3c/fa5f44a3cc48ee0baef4438d095d56a6.jpg"><br><br>  On the top of the power button only.  What I didn‚Äôt really like was switching on with one click.  Sometimes you just want to check if the device is working or turned off, and you press it and it turns on immediately. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d62/789/247/d627892474d58e3d8b4a0b9ede03b37c.jpg"><br><br>  And on the bottom there are contacts for connecting the main accessory: keyboard covers.  The tablet is quite thin - not like the MacBook Air, but still thinner than most other models. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/3e7/4e3/911/3e74e3911105869b64975b268d074239.jpg"><br><br>  The whole design looks really beautiful.  Looks like a laptop, only more portable and compact. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/321/e10/005/321e10005766038628aabb98cad1d806.jpg"><br><br>  However, the paint, which is covered with the device, with time, with frequent friction on the surface can peel off, exposing the true color of the material.  Therefore, it is better to take care of the case before buying. <br><br><h2>  <font color="00a8ff">‚ñå</font> <font color="000000">DISPLAY</font> </h2><br>  The tablet is equipped with a screen with a diagonal of 10.6 inches and a resolution of 1920 x 1080, which ultimately amounts to 208 pixels per inch (ppi).  The Surface display is covered with glass, has an anti-glare filter and oleophobic coating. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/7fe/dc9/02c/7fedc902c32d251846ac55c9ee72bac5.jpg"><br><br>  Acceptable colors, high contrast.  The image is dominated by a ‚Äúcold‚Äù hue.  The white color is really white, but black colors, especially at an angle, acquire a slightly violet hue.  In bright sunlight, you can see something only at maximum brightness.  By the way, there are no problems with it - it is here with a margin.  With dim daylight and artificial lighting for me, the brightness was about 50-60% comfortable. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d02/e0d/50e/d02e0d50e684c19e8785986aafb8ac5e.jpg"><br><br>  The Surface 2 RT display supports ClearType technology and multi-touch on five points. <br><br><h2>  <font color="ff0000">‚ñå</font> <font color="000000">CAMERAS</font> </h2><br>  The front camera Surface 2 allows you to call even in low light.  The picture through the darkness turns out quite juicy.  Microsoft really responsibly approached the implementation of the WEB-camera, positioning Surface as a reference device for making video calls in Skype.  The front camera at 3.5 MP gives an excellent high-resolution picture, even in low light. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/1d1/4ad/b04/1d14adb04225b7c588a841ed06b30d74.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/9fd/3eb/2bd/9fd3eb2bd2f4a4b4ab27686a123cb41a.jpg"><br><br>  On a 5 megapixel camera in normal lighting, you get good photos with natural color, if you do not find fault with the details.

Today, when the market is filled with tablets on a full-fledged Windows 8, the choice of a less functional Windows RT can only be explained by the need to install a single-chip system on the ARM architecture in the tablet. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/9b6/f3a/615/9b6f3a615341c32e5766dc419cb373f7.png"><br><br>  With the arrival of the last major update, shortcuts for the search bar and tablet power management menu appeared right on the start screen next to the avatar and username in the upper right corner.  And near the button for switching to the ‚ÄúApplications‚Äù panel, an indicator of the number of new applications installed in the system appeared from the initial screen. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f2e/90d/8d1/f2e90d8d18885a3cdf3eed818ed1594b.png"><br><br>  Attachments have appeared sorting by name, installation date, frequency of use and categories.  I like the third sort more, and left it. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d55/a34/c7f/d55a34c7f36e7c7ce138c6e5e19ecd05.png"><br><br>  On the RT version, the only significant difference from the older version and the main drawback of the OS is the inability to launch applications from other versions of the Windows family.  This means that in addition to the pre-installed software, it‚Äôs simply impossible to install anything there, and the choice of software is limited only by offers from the Windows Store.  By the way, at the moment the store has about 160,000 applications. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/9f3/115/cdf/9f3115cdfec73a2c3d3cd66bd86a1bc0.png"><br><br>  The problem is also aggravated by a strange company policy - a ban on installing applications from any sources other than the App Store.  True, you can do a kind of "jailbreak" to lift this ban.  After that, it will be possible to run any application compiled under the ARM architecture, since the <a href="http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php%3Ft%3D2092348">list of such applications</a> has already been sufficiently large.  Only unfortunately, for the new version of Windows 8.1, a jailbreak has not yet been released, but it will definitely be soon! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f3d/6fe/9e2/f3d6fe9e28f77ce216cbce271a4ec814.png"><br><br>  On Windows RT, there is a traditional desktop with a panel, notifications, and shortcuts.  You can create folders and documents, sort them and change the desktop background. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c93/bfb/b32/c93bfbb322982c4c4f759811086e9aee.png"><br><br>  There are also Explorer, as well as the ability to work with files, as in Windows 8. However, only a few pre-installed programs work in the desktop interface - Office, Scissors, Paint, and some others.  And let me remind you: you cannot install new programs that would have the familiar Windows 8 window interface (in the Store all programs work in a tiled interface and are moderated for this). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/159/fff/fce/159ffffce492e276ff3932ea30f29611.png"><br><br>  The disadvantage that I noticed when using the window interface is the blurring of some elements.  Most likely, this minus is associated with unfinished scaling.  If at HD resolution the blur of fonts is not so noticeable, then on FullHD it does not look very nice.  It is possible that with the update this bug will be removed, but so far it looks like this. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/8c6/498/f6f/8c6498f6fb680715a7640c6a64d331a9.png"><br><br>  Windows RT has a significant advantage compared to Windows 8: this is the presence of a pre-installed and completely free office suite Microsoft Office 2013 (whereas in a regular Windows 8 there is no pre-installed Office, you have to buy it). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/795/ddf/f57/795ddff5760708c3f417a02f3e901d38.png"><br><br>  However, be prepared for the fact that MS Office on Windows RT is not exactly the same Office as for Windows 7/8.  First, it contains only four applications with a familiar interface: Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and OneNote.  Outlook comes as a tiled Mail app.  In addition, the Office interface is slightly different from the standard PC version (it shows the desire to optimize for touch control), and most importantly, there is no support for macros and ActiveX. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/5de/c02/395/5dec0239597662e43579c7eff931c35d.png"><br><br>  Another interesting point is multitasking.  In RT, it is implemented at a good level, familiar to the full Windows.  Up to the point that the Flash player can be active on a web page, while the user is engaged in other tasks at this time. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/990/8ef/9ab/9908ef9ab3a0a25a1bb0862c7b39b6f9.png"><br><br>  In the tiled interface, there is also a convenient switch between applications.  There is a way to simultaneously view and control two applications.  You can, for example, open a browser or video on 75% of the screen, and correspond with Skype for the remaining 25%.  On other operating systems, you have to switch between applications, which is not always convenient. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/7b0/19b/58d/7b019b58dc856cd82950e5c1e46b98c7.png"><br><br>  And it is not necessary that the second application has a Metro style. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/dd1/64f/395/dd164f3959f429f07810ca69475a7d1b.png"><br><br>  We should also talk about Internet Explorer.  You will not believe, but this is not the old and buggy Internet opener, but a convenient browser with support for gestures.  I am sure that many owners of touch tablets or laptops will agree with me.  By the way, a full-fledged Flash player works in IE.  For many, this is an important parameter, for example, to play your favorite social game.  networks.  But Java and Silverlight plugins cannot be installed. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/56b/745/279/56b745279d15bee50126b9aa0b5ea56a.png"><br><br>  Very cool integration with OneDrive cloud service.  We edit the document on a PC or laptop, save it.  Then we start Microsoft Word on the tablet and in the last documents our file is already visible, open it and you can continue working with it.  If you want your files to always be synchronized and available offline, then do not forget to enable this feature. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e7b/1a7/da2/e7b1a7da20c4c3074adaf3241679c7ed.png"><br><br>  The tiled interface for touch screens is implemented very conveniently and beautifully, with an emphasis on gesture support, it is pleasant to use.  If I immediately disconnected it on a PC, then my hand stretches to open the Start menu or close the application with a swipe down (now, so on Android I often try to do it unaccustomed).  I would like to mention the response to the touch.  It is instant, the image moves immediately with a finger.  Perhaps, a similar fast response can only be compared with the Nexus 7, because on the other devices the brakes are immediately visible.  I am glad that many file types are supported out of the box, for example, PDF or ZIP.  Therefore, there is no need to reinstall applications from the Store. <br><br>  And I will write a list of applications that I use (maybe someone will come in handy). <br>  <a href="http://apps.microsoft.com/webpdp/app/aa71044c-c4b9-4a9c-96fa-2ab6f9d716c8">Hyper for YouTube</a> - <a href="http://apps.microsoft.com/webpdp/app/aa71044c-c4b9-4a9c-96fa-2ab6f9d716c8">YouTube</a> Client <br>  <a href="http://apps.microsoft.com/webpdp/app/3353eea7-6df2-4ac9-92a2-ad0a0d652500">Online Movies</a> - a huge number of films of different genres <br>  <a href="http://apps.microsoft.com/webpdp/app/7c1eafcc-2795-4ed2-a06d-d45a2bcab37c">CyberLink PowerDVD Mobile</a> - a functional player that understands the mkv format <br>  <a href="http://apps.microsoft.com/webpdp/app/73049c99-963d-4989-99bd-b550d336f9c9">8 Zip</a> - Archiver <br>  <a href="http://apps.microsoft.com/webpdp/app/1e95b283-8562-4993-8166-db4b0927eecb">Files &amp; Folders</a> - file manager <br>  <a href="http://apps.microsoft.com/webpdp/app/74c494fd-dbcd-4e6e-982d-1ea710e62019">ivi.ru</a> - Russian service to access a bunch of movies <br>  <a href="http://apps.microsoft.com/webpdp/app/55677f7c-3dab-4a57-95b2-4efd44a0e692">VKontakte</a> - besides communication, you can also listen to music <br>  <a href="http://apps.microsoft.com/webpdp/app/8289549f-9bae-4d44-9a5c-63d9c3a79f35">Twitter</a> - I write different things <br> <a href="http://apps.microsoft.com/webpdp/app/78b08472-168e-496e-a8f5-9601892da4fa"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Dropbox</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> - a cloud with the right files </font></font><br> <a href="http://apps.microsoft.com/webpdp/app/7a5aebdf-75c9-4c1d-93f2-44fdbc27ffad"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Viber</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> - an alternative to Skype</font></font><br><br><h2>  <font color="EA5F39">‚ñå</font> <font color="000000">WIRELESS NETWORKS</font> </h2><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">There are only standard Wi-Fi and Bluetooth. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Wi-Fi works in dual-band mode (2.4 GHz + 5 GHz) </font></font><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/87c/89c/5f8/87c89c5f8dc35aadc2b32f309d06570a.png"><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">.

Microsoft did a lot of work on its brainchild (faster processor, extended battery life, improved display) and fixed many shortcomings.  Surface 2 has several competitive advantages: design, stuffing and firmware.  Plus, you can buy a convenient keyboard, activate bonuses and synchronize the tablet with your home PC.  However, the Store with a small number of applications is still not able to withstand the Play Store and the Apple Store. <br>  And most likely you need to add that Surface is more suitable not for the consumption of content, but for its creation.  For those people who spend more time behind a web browser or office and are looking for a portable PC replacement.  That is why I still have not bought myself a tablet on Android or on iOS, simply because I did not see the point in it.  With Surface, the situation has changed.  The tablet not only allows me to watch TV shows and spend time with toys, but also to fully work with documents and files.  Personally, I did not feel a lack of applications.  Many services that do not have their own app in the Store offer a fairly user-friendly web interface.  However, by the second course I will need to work with narrower software and then my view slowly falls on Surface 2 Pro, but it will be a completely different story. <br><br><h2>  <font color="0c00ff">‚ñå</font> <font color="000000">ADVANTAGES AND DISADVANTAGES</font> </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/3a7/99a/ea7/3a799aea7d11fc5d49274e15b6642e35.png" alt="image">  Original design <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/3a7/99a/ea7/3a799aea7d11fc5d49274e15b6642e35.png" alt="image">  High-quality and clear display, responds quickly to response <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/3a7/99a/ea7/3a799aea7d11fc5d49274e15b6642e35.png" alt="image">  High performance <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/3a7/99a/ea7/3a799aea7d11fc5d49274e15b6642e35.png" alt="image">  Good camera <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/3a7/99a/ea7/3a799aea7d11fc5d49274e15b6642e35.png" alt="image">  Full USB 3.0 port <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/3a7/99a/ea7/3a799aea7d11fc5d49274e15b6642e35.png" alt="image">  MicroSDXC slot <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/3a7/99a/ea7/3a799aea7d11fc5d49274e15b6642e35.png" alt="image">  Comfortable and durable stand with two modes <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/3a7/99a/ea7/3a799aea7d11fc5d49274e15b6642e35.png" alt="image">  Long battery life <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/3a7/99a/ea7/3a799aea7d11fc5d49274e15b6642e35.png" alt="image">  Fast and beautiful Metro interface <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/3a7/99a/ea7/3a799aea7d11fc5d49274e15b6642e35.png" alt="image">  Microsoft Office is free. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/3a7/99a/ea7/3a799aea7d11fc5d49274e15b6642e35.png" alt="image">  Bonuses in the form of coupons for OneDrive and Skype <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/4f2/996/400/4f29964003baaf62d7bfefa7f2e32bf1.png" alt="image">  Small number of applications (compared to other OS) <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/4f2/996/400/4f29964003baaf62d7bfefa7f2e32bf1.png" alt="image">  Unable to install application from other sources <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/4f2/996/400/4f29964003baaf62d7bfefa7f2e32bf1.png" alt="image">  Quiet speakers <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/4f2/996/400/4f29964003baaf62d7bfefa7f2e32bf1.png" alt="image">  Keyboard not included <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/4f2/996/400/4f29964003baaf62d7bfefa7f2e32bf1.png" alt="image">  Own charger <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/4f2/996/400/4f29964003baaf62d7bfefa7f2e32bf1.png" alt="image">  High price <br><br><h2>  <font color="E4F43B">‚ñå</font> <font color="000000">PRICE AND PURCHASE</font> </h2><br>  In Russia, Surface 2 RT is not yet for sale, but you can easily buy a tablet in the United States using the services of the <a href="http://shop4import.com/cabinet/partner/4226">Shop4import.com</a> intermediary.
