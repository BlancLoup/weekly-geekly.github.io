How to fix it?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/c01/aab/7e4/c01aab7e44ff057fbc44730319e82182.jpg"><br><br>  Solid state drives have finally become available to most laptop and PC users.  They have many advantages, the main of which is high performance, but there are also disadvantages.  The disadvantages include less durability compared to HDD (recording resource).  True, modern solid-state drives usually have a longer service life than obsolescence. <br><br>  The full potential of the hard core opens as a system disk.  In this configuration, the operating system and applications installed on the system disk read and write data to the solid-state drive.  As <a href="https://www.servethehome.com/firefox-is-eating-your-ssd-here-is-how-to-fix-it/">it turned out</a> , Mozilla Firefox browser writes a relatively large amount of data every day, which kills the SSD resource. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Most PC users know that browsers write a lot of data to a hard disk or HDD.  But how much?  Sergei Bobik, who installed the free version of SSDLife on his computer, thought about this.  This software allows you to assess the state of the SSD and shows the approximate lifetime of the drive.

      For two days, Sergei did not work with anything except the browser and email.  And I was very surprised when I learned that 12 GB of data was recorded on a solid-state drive on one of these two days.  Since he didn‚Äôt download any large files, and the working sites could not give a cache of such size, it was decided to find the cause of the incident. <br><br>  Sergey Bobik monitored the statistics provided by the application for two weeks.  As it turned out, even when the computer was not working (but was not turned off), large amounts of data up to 10 GB were loaded onto the solid-state drive. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/9b5/d75/e98/9b5d75e980b045f897d2841af6b969a5.jpg"><br><br>  The main culprit of the incident was the browser Firefox.  He downloaded from 300 KB to 2 MB every second.  Record was kept in a file called recovery.js.  As it turned out, this is a backup of the Firefox session.  It is used if a browser or an operating system crashes.  This is a useful, but resource-intensive feature.  And if we take into account the fact that SSD has a limited resource, then here you need to decide for yourself what is more useful - a working disk or the restoration of the current browser session after its fall. <br><br>  Sergey writes that the problem is not only in one file.  In order to study the problem more fully, he performed several additional actions: <br>  1. Set browser.sessionstore.interval to 15000 ms and close all open browser tabs; <br>  2. Opened a single tab with Google.com, waited a couple of minutes and closed it; <br>  3. I opened the browser again and checked the size of the recovery.js.  Its size has decreased to 5 KB instead of 900 KB; <br>  4. Opened several reviews of different devices in two different windows.  Looked for reviews and opened search results in new tabs; <br>  5. Opened the third browser window, opened several sites in the tabs of this window; <br>  6. I launched Process Monitor and started tracking recovery.js files and cookies *. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/7ac/030/f35/7ac030f3599f897dbce8b2f1b1199d2b.jpg"><br><br>  7. Removed event logging in ‚ÄúFile-&gt; Capture Events‚Äù.  Existing logs were also cleaned; <br>  8. Again activated the event logging in ‚ÄúFile-&gt; Capture Events‚Äù.  Left the above three browser windows for 45 minutes.  At this time, Sergey turned on Chrome for his own needs; <br>  9. I looked through browser statistics in ‚ÄúTools-&gt; File Summary‚Äù. <br><br>  As it turned out, during this time, Firefox has written 1.1 GB of data to disk.  The main volume is cookies *. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/084/4e1/eba/0844e1ebacde3ed0faddc49f8fcb2b19.jpg"><br><br>  At the same time, the file after all the manipulations performed has grown only to a volume of 1.3 MB. <br><br>  Sergey returned to Firefox and in one of the windows opened a mailbox in outlook.com.  I cleared all event logs in Process Monitor and started monitoring again.  This time, he left Firefox idle for just 10 minutes.  After this, the recovery.js size increased to 1.5 MB.  Cookies again took up many hundreds of megabytes on the SSD. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/5cc/b4c/54f/5ccb4c54f980f1b2703ecd4850209099.jpg"><br><br>  According to the author of the work, the browser can write a bunch of data to the recovery.js file, cookies, or simultaneously record information both there and there.  If you take the constant 1.1 GB of recorded Firefox data, then during the working day you can expect to write information of 35 GB, if you do not turn off the system.  After the measurements it turned out that the record in the file recovery.js is kept constantly at a speed of 2 MB / s. <br><br><h3>  What can be done? </h3><br>
