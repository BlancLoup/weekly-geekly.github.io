And in the depot too, because Aeroexpress has its own trains, its own depot for their service and its crews of machinists.  That is all his own, except for the rails and electricity. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/h8/zh/vl/h8zhvlxlmhn3ou1jlpkwwb7hh7c.jpeg"><br><br>  In this photo, three generations of electric trains can be seen from the depot: the new double-deck ES2 train, a rather old ED4 (this was the first generation of express trains to the airport) and EG2T, the ‚Äúaverage‚Äù performance between them is a good workhorse, which is also being repaired at the Aeroexpress depot.

    <img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/jv/ec/jx/jvecjx3frwglwq3qjqszspjsjrq.jpeg"><br>  <i>Works in the driver's cab.</i> <br><br>  This is a very, very interesting example of a company on the infrastructure of Russian Railways. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h3>  What it is? </h3><br>  Aeroexpress is a comfortable electric train to the airports of the Moscow Aviation Hub (Vnukovo, Domodedovo and Sheremetyevo) from Kiev, Paveletsky and Belorussky railway stations from Moscow.  A quick way to get from the city to the airport with a minimum of stops: from Domodedovo there is a stop on the interchange circuit of the Upper Boilers, and from Sheremetyevo - now on Okruzhnaya, and all this is past traffic jams.  As elsewhere in the world, this method is more expensive than classic public transport, but cheaper than a taxi.  According to international definitions, transportation is considered intermodal, since seamless is the delivery of passengers from the hub to the hub (from the airport to the station). <br><br><h3>  How it all began? </h3><br>  In 2005-2007, the company only sold tickets.  The rolling stock and everything connected with it was rented from Russian Railways.  In 2008, the first own trains were purchased (which still run on the Sheremetyevo direction).  Here is one of them under maintenance: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/s0/jz/xg/s0jzxgvhslfpr3pl8lv0lay9v48.jpeg"><br><br>  In 2011, the first in-house locomotive brigade appeared, that is, besides trains, Aeroexpress began working with operations. <br><br>  In 2012, they also took the service for themselves, for which they rented an old depot near Belorussky railway station, built in the 19th century for locomotives, for long-term rent.  Here is the turntable: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/sk/xe/5i/skxe5i9qkf_gbggtc3tgd3x8mje.jpeg"><br><br><h3>  What kind of depot? </h3><br>  The fan part is a depot built in the 19th century.  Behind it is already a normal, more modern depot of the 1960 sample of three stages (rooms).  It was these three steps that Aeroexpress took and began to modernize. <br><br>  Historically, this locomotive depot.  Each step had to accommodate two locomotives on the same ditch (from several ditches), that is, the length of the buildings was 72 meters per step.  Then, due to new types of traction - diesel and electric - the depot was expanded.  The first stage remained unchanged.  The second one was extended, the continuation was completed to the part with arches.  Here are the old vaults: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/cc/dp/v6/ccdpv6xzfi7kqnvfsai8xllgks4.jpeg"><br><br>  The second step was 125 meters.  The third stage is the newest part, 260 meters long, it was completed the longest.  It is now the only depot in Moscow and the region with a workshop not straight, but curved.  This curved part was completed in 1975-1976 due to the development of suburban transportation.  Then the commuter trains consisted of two cars, then six out of the Riga-made electric train.  Then the composition began to grow.  The depot was completed on 12 ER2 wagons (now these trains are almost all written off).  The Latvian plant, by the way, is still making the components that are used in ED4, the new EP2, and on the Orioles from the third number are also components of the Riga plant.  Now Latvia is making the electrical part, supplying the car assemblies to the TVZ, and there they are assembled, commissioned, tested and commissioned. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/8p/8t/2g/8p8t2gsvxxuuyoknph3ih5modju.jpeg"><br>  <i>Shunting work is also carried out by the company on its own locomotives.</i> <br><br><h3>  How did the two-story Aeroexpress come about? </h3><br>  In 2012, it became clear that passenger traffic will grow.  Three years later, a new solution was needed.  Traditional - attach more cars.  But the estimated 12 cars did not fit on the platforms, and modifying the platforms was not a cheap pleasure. <br><br>  The second feature - the longer the train, the higher the cost of its operation on the infrastructure of railways. <br><br>  World experience - two floors.  For the sample they took the German Deutsche Bahn and the Dutch NS.  We decided to buy double-decker trains.  Nowadays, the modern six-car Aeroexpress train has more seats than the first-generation ten-car train, it is serviced 6 times less, and the cost of its operation is much less. <br><br>  We bought new trains, rented them back to Russian Railways.  Now owned 7 ED4MKM-AERO and 11 ESH2.  Of the two-decker nine 6-car and two 4-car.  Double-decker walk in Vnukovo and Domodedovo, but can not in Sheremetyevo.  Physically crawl through, but can not pass through the tolerances of approaching buildings.  This question is now being discussed, it is necessary to slightly raise the contact wire on one of the overpasses. <br><br><h3>  How did you choose a vendor for a double-decker train? </h3><br>  A tender was announced, in the framework of which it was necessary to develop quite a lot of things specifically for Aeroexpress taking into account operating experience and then produce, supply and service trains under warranty.  Stadler (read "Stadler"), ≈†koda, and Alstom reached the final of the tender.  There were applications from China and Korea, in particular, from Hyundai, but they did not have experience in building double-decker trains, that is, the entire development was supposed to be done almost from the beginning on this project.  And the rest of the finalists had the trains already in operation, albeit not quite the same, but double-decker.  As a result, Condler won in consumer quality.  Purchased 11 trains.  That is, a modern two-story Aeroexpress is a very highly modified Stadler KISS.  Two-storied of this size from the same common ancestor walks in Azerbaijan and Georgia, and there are many smaller dimensions in Europe for a long time. <br><br><h3>  We stopped at the depot ... What did they do there? </h3><br>  In 2012, there was a large-scale reconstruction for more than a billion rubles.  Lasted two years - this is to serve the double-decker trains.  The reconstruction was sponsored entirely at the expense of the company's own funds.  It turned out interesting.  See: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/rp/ea/mz/rpeamzeascjuptkhwml4x7uxhhy.jpeg"><br><br>  See these yellow jacks? <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/pc/h8/jp/pch8jpkjera01ovqhc_d44wpsem.jpeg"><br><br>  These are not just jacks, this is installation on 12 mobile columns.  At the same time, the entire installation at any place of the depot can lift three cars in a hitch.  That is, to change the cart on the six-rail Aeroexpress, it is not necessary to disassemble the entire train.  You can unhook it exactly in half, raise half, do the work, put back.  By Russian standards, it is almost like a Formula 1 box for speed.  Now just Stadler changes carts.  By the way, in comparison with the classical methods, it is very fast, almost without decommissioning of trains. <br><br>  And this is the under-ground wheel-turning machine Koltech.  Needed for turning wheel sets, this is an important part of servicing any train so that the wheels are the same size after wear.  In metrodepo usually need to shoot a pair to serve.  They are now considering the purchase of such machines.  And here it is enough just to put the train on top and start work. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ko/9-/x0/ko9-x0qoi_jkmxx_-pw_wi-jxc4.jpeg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/5_/g0/vq/5_g0vqzorth0wrpzgdtwecdw_w0.jpeg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ij/fg/4u/ijfg4ujmumzbs9gov8dklqqsyfw.jpeg"><br><br>  The chip box is typed in three days: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/lu/pe/if/lupeifmrab9q_xveu1g_3y9kidu.jpeg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/hv/ok/kf/hvokkfmtfftorg2slmvco2yv4j8.jpeg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/pu/sd/-0/pusd-03qs9cakxtca6dwfyiyx-m.jpeg"><br><br>  CPP also puts its trains in this depot for maintenance: this is because of the quality and experience. <br><br>  But the overpass: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/jr/xk/dh/jrxkdhnh92o8bcleln10qt4okhw.jpeg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/3r/3f/ju/3r3fjuneyjiy2g9mw4qzsfmpgws.jpeg"><br><br>  Everything is green because of the green LED strip at the contact busbar.  The busbar in the depot is needed to serve the train entirely and check in all modes on the repair position.  Earlier this was done in the park.  And the garland is a part of security.  When green, there is no voltage on the contact wire.  You can climb on the roof and work.  The voltage will not turn on if at least one door on the overpass is open.  Then it turns red. <br><br><h3>  What is it on his roof? </h3><br>  Almost all the equipment of the new Aeroexpress is on the roof.  The roof in the middle is smooth.  Accordingly, the staff should be close.  This overpass extends completely to the train, handrails are pulled out. <br><br>  That's what's being served there.  Climate block (there is air conditioning, air conditioning, UV lamp package, and so on): <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/pj/_n/qu/pj_nqucetcwf1uo8wysmhsnpbu0.jpeg"><br><br>  AFU: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/oi/3w/7w/oi3w7wxq4fadeuomljri2qjtpd4.jpeg"><br><br>  U-shaped is a radio antenna: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/36/b4/-0/36b4-0rzqtjo97pudbn9b3dw6k4.jpeg"><br><br>  Battery in box: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ly/f_/4_/lyf_4_bxjtjz0ebvpjpisluhcx0.jpeg"><br><br>  Current collector: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/_j/-i/dk/_j-idka5rj3q65wawlxxfru5r7u.jpeg"><br><br>  Traction converter: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ww/a3/g1/wwa3g1gltd70rnhxrahuvfynjxk.jpeg"><br><br>  Similar roof of the generation before last and of the past: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/4m/hr/ql/4mhrqlj8arhbp4cgnaqcyvygfvi.jpeg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/qw/jd/kl/qwjdklymvbgrmqtg0upghp9nmau.jpeg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/nw/tz/x4/nwtzx4z2a3uiev2ws0leikador0.jpeg"><br>  <i>The height of past generations is 4.6 meters, the new two-story one is 5.2 meters.</i> <br><br><h3>  So where does the second floor come from? </h3><br>  The bottom of the car is smooth - it is almost the floor of the passenger compartment: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/al/1j/9t/al1j9tlfp7lc2ni1zfebn1xw_py.jpeg"><br><br>  We compose PSN, battery and other devices below, at the end of the post there will be a link to examples with TVZ.  But all the equipment here is arranged from above above the vestibules.  Tamburam second floor is not needed.  This is how it looks from inside the car: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/te/bt/lo/tebtlojxrydriucnfhs3e7cf3l8.jpeg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/_x/rj/-w/_xrj-wtnuitgq7bltjp_ldmbjxi.jpeg"><br><br>  Much more compact.  Here is the DC motor on the previous generation of Aeroexpress: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/if/es/f7/ifesf7toodncexkbjgomh9ccwe0.jpeg"><br><br>  But it is three times smaller and twice as powerful on the new generation: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/mf/r7/fc/mfr7fcpk6aiwmf6z3xvcpmbdhju.jpeg"><br><br>  Asynchronous drive, new traction converter and many other technological wonders appeared on the new generation.  Also compact and effective. <br><br><h3>  And where are all the wires and tracks? </h3><br>  Hitchless double hitch.  External airtight prevents new passengers from getting inside the train and protects the tracks from dust and moisture.  And the internal gateway is needed for the movement of passengers. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/_n/8g/ta/_n8gtanf1mu2p8p0ejyelfu7hwk.jpeg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ji/oh/nm/jiohnmkewdmw6edqu8bfd_xl1lg.jpeg"><br><br>  Air line bottom, rigid, without sleeves: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/rn/xu/bp/rnxubp-idfk1ssw_xgi0ovmxum4.jpeg"><br><br>  Nearby, by the way, 380V for coastal power supply of wagons (in particular, for diagnostic systems when parked): <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/mn/5o/ke/mn5okebxrpp_u3x1zbqvyfzxz24.jpeg"><br><br>  From the inside it looks like this: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/va/ky/g5/vakyg50sxafxuls7qlnpzvhzk3e.jpeg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/nl/qv/ge/nlqvge4v9iv1nftginmbybvbnhe.jpeg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/el/1e/-9/el1e-9qrjrszrcq3i-puwjvaofw.jpeg"><br><br>  The most dangerous thing for a train is a tire on the tracks (children are sometimes left).  Because she jumps under the cars and separates the sleeves of the brake line.  The train gets up.  The driver always at the sight of an obstacle or danger applies emergency braking.  So, here the highway is protected from such things. <br><br>  Another part of communications and equipment is hidden under the panel: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/sy/qw/0e/syqw0eksj0pki6pyjjbtt_bqeuu.jpeg"><br><br>  The doors are very thick, with double or triple sealing: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/2c/jy/lq/2cjylq3ttdjdzxnsractyqmwuzs.jpeg"><br><br><h3>  What's in the car? </h3><br>  Business class, wide chairs, a lot of space: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/3u/gk/lv/3ugklvo-b7z1b-i38mmrdi8txlq.jpeg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/yq/jj/kz/yqjjkzlldjc0cqdghjgies7lkbm.jpeg"><br><br>  Built-in bar: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/b9/xg/kw/b9xgkwteylts1q-d5imwhisboi8.jpeg"><br><br>  And wardrobe: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/gu/wf/vi/guwfvibuukvsryr4e3fsonmp7uc.jpeg"><br><br>  Generally, embedding different subsystems is a sore point.  All these things should be considered at the time of the car design, so that they look like relatives.  If suddenly after the assembly it is necessary to hang fire sensors - they will disfigure everything.  New Aeroexpress designed with all the features at once. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/fc/i6/ro/fci6rohdnwudk-pjirvb1nx2bd4.jpeg"><br><br>  Here is the toilet, it is normal: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/wx/bi/ez/wxbiezj6ffupmr0qhqdwmlx7cjq.jpeg"><br><br>  Here is the economy: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/h5/li/pg/h5lipgl5thysffwvgjgncjaezts.jpeg"><br><br>  Indirect stop valve: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/cw/a_/_x/cwa__xoliqqpehkwvyealompdsi.jpeg"><br><br>  Emergency stairs under luggage racks: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/9m/lr/fs/9mlrfsiujtj_4ik0zotp6gkdyuw.jpeg"><br><br>  They are needed to, if necessary, climb to the roof of the composition somewhere off the beaten path.  They - for evacuation through the window. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/tl/eq/l-/tleql--dx7djwdznejyg5j2snlk.jpeg"><br><br>  There are up to 10 cameras in the car, a registrar and a camera in the cab to record the driver‚Äôs actions. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/kb/ri/zc/kbrizclohfrmgpeifexizuc-j-k.jpeg"><br><br>  This ramp between the platform and the car for people with disabilities.  Here is a lift inside the car for passengers with limited mobility: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/94/os/r7/94osr7ci8glriaq7usijk0voxbw.jpeg"><br><br>  And this is a toilet for passengers with low mobility: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/or/2z/gs/or2zgs1y0msrstedig0t6b_qqdw.jpeg"><br><br>  The table reclines for swaddling.  Behind him is a package of UV lamps for disinfecting the table (the lamps are lit when the table is closed): <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/re/gh/jj/reghjj91cg7emibaqyciksccbwi.jpeg"><br><br><h3>  How is the train served? </h3><br>  New much easier than previous generations.  In the depot about 150 people.  The maintenance of 11 new trains requires only 10-15 people out of these 150. The maintenance cycle is the same as before, 3-4 hours, but the new train calls at the depot once a month, and not once every 6-8 days (with a mileage of 500 km per day).  Here, look, Stadler changes pairs, and it is clear that the pads almost did not wear out in a year: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ws/0h/-w/ws0h-wx0ucrepmp3tmdczt8ebig.jpeg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/lh/lt/ez/lhltez9orzrtf0ihc_tq6prodda.jpeg"><br><br>  The double-glazed window gets one action, it under this elastic band: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ng/wi/n6/ngwin6bd88kbf0hkuer9flnu0lw.jpeg"><br><br>  Current collectors with composite materials: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/kx/f_/uj/kxf_ujygskk5grcwgy1hda0em0y.jpeg"><br><br>  The photo is one that wears out in freezing rain overnight.  New ones are much better now. <br><br><h3>  What is in the cabin? </h3><br>  Driver.
