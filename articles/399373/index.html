Part 1: Tunnel Syndromes - Review and Diagnose Problems</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Carpal tunnel syndrome - pain, numbness in the hands, a frequent companion of people working for a long time at the computer.  Many popular publications and ergonomic solutions reduce the problem only to long-term traumatization of the median nerve in the carpal canal, which greatly simplifies the situation and does not provide an effective solution. <br><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/0f0/d0f/818/0f0d0f81898647f49c30fec1f7205231.png" alt="image"></p><br>  The main problem is that for working at the computer, precise small movements of the arm in a static pose are used, because of which there are prerequisites for damage to the neurovascular bundles along the entire length - from the neck to the hand.  And often the pain in the hand is the result of long-term problems not related to the carpal tunnel. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b>Radicular syndromes of the hands</b> <br><br>  A common cause of pain in the hands when working at a computer is the presence of damage to the spinal roots that extend in the cervical spine.

      Initially, pain in the neck bothers me; as the problem develops, periodic exacerbations appear when the pain from the neck is reflected in the arm.  The peak is cervical radiculitis - the pains become intense, cannot be removed by analgesics, numbness appears along the root (in the picture below, the sensitivity zones for the roots are marked).  All this is usually called "exacerbation of osteochondrosis." <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/bc7/829/d79/bc7829d79bab40ee9f0f72e636d96113.jpg" alt="Segmental innervation of the arm"><br><br>  The simplest test to identify possible problems in the neck is to determine the tension of the shoulder glands.  Feel the muscles of your shoulder glands, especially in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe upper corner of the shoulder blade - if there are pain points, and the muscles themselves are tense - this is a typical example of the response to the load when working at a computer. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zE51yE-LZEg" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  <b>Ladder muscle syndrome</b> <br><br>  The neurovascular bundles are surrounded by muscles, bones, ligaments and fascia.  The first place where squeezing of the neurovascular bundle for a hand can be is to pass it through a channel formed by the anterior and middle scalene muscle. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ce0/e68/ae0/ce0e68ae0b1f40c19f00b749dc4a29fd.jpg" alt="anterior scalene muscle syndrome"><br><br>  Here is a test to identify problems in this area: <br><br>  Raise your arms straight up, towards the ceiling, in a standing or sitting position and try to hold for a minute.  If there is numbness before the end of the minute, paresthesia ("running the goosebumps") in your hands - you are on the direct path to not sleeping at night due to hand numbness, undergoing long courses of treatment with vascular and anti-inflammatory drugs with very short effect. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/274/a1f/e5f/274a1fe5fd524cc09d19f7501d8f9e82.jpg" alt="test for the presence of scalenus syndrome"><br><br>  With the ladder muscle syndrome, a violation of the venous and lymphatic outflow from the arm initially occurs, which causes swelling of the limb and creates prerequisites for squeezing the neurovascular bundles in narrow places on the arm.  Most often this occurs in the carpal canal, elbow canal, under the circular pronator of the forearm. <br><br>  <b>Carpal tunnel syndrome</b> <br><br>  The most common tunnel syndrome of the upper limb.  The trouble is that it is extremely rare in isolation and without working out other areas where neurovascular bundles can be squeezed, the results of treatment will be unsatisfactory. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/43b/ca7/f66/43bca7f6689b4c8abf9f32667229aff5.jpg" alt="carpal tunnel syndrome"><br><br>  Try to get up and with a little effort put pressure on the table with the palm of the hand extended in the wrist joint. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/8f4/5c4/17f/8f45c417feee4d99a0c9b63c88dd247f.png" alt="carpal tunnel syndrome test"><br><br>  Hold your hand in that position for a minute.  If numbness appears before the end of the minute, a burning sensation in the hand is a sign of serious changes in the region of the channel. <br><br>  <b>Elbow Canal Syndrome</b> <br><br>  Often met with people working at a desk with glass on the tabletop.  Now it is less common due to the fact that the working conditions have changed, but the damage due to chronic compression of this area is still found in those people who work, leaning their elbows on the hard armrest. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/832/7ee/6f0/8327ee6f07f74ad483eba02c73ba3acf.jpg" alt="ulnar canal syndrome"><br><br>  Test for a possible problem: confidently, gently press into the hole on the inner surface of the elbow with your thumb and hold it - the rapid appearance of discomfort along the ulnar nerve is an indicator of the possible presence of ulnar canal syndrome. <br><br>  <b>Round Pronator Syndrome</b> <br><br>  Most often, the round pronator is overstrained with twisting movements of the arm (working with a screwdriver), however, even when working at a computer, this place can be injured by a sharp edge or a lining on the edge of the table. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a6e/cff/5e9/a6ecff5e91b643bbabb4d7086e6d3294.jpg" alt="round pronator syndrome test"><br><br>  Test for a possible problem: strongly push in the trigger point of a round pronator with your thumb - the appearance of unpleasant sensations along the median nerve is an indicator of the possible presence of a round pronator syndrome. <br><br>  <b>Summary</b> <br><br>  Early diagnosis and prevention of problems - the key factors for the preservation and multiplication of their health.  Thanks to this article you have the opportunity to test yourself and determine the initial state. <br><br>  In the next article, I will share with you my experience of a neurologist and a teacher of somatic training in relieving chronic muscle tension for the prevention of tunnel hand syndromes. <br><br>  To make it easier for me to decide on the next topic - leave a response in the survey. <br><br>  PS The second article of the cycle is devoted <a href="https://geektimes.ru/post/283006/">to relieving tension from the shoulders</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/399373/">https://habr.com/ru/post/399373/</a></p>
