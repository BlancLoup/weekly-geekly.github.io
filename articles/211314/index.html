More than 80 female students studying at the faculty of computer science or related specialties visited our Russian offices to learn more about engineering projects, the scholarship program and <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2591%25D0%25BE%25D1%2580%25D0%25B3,_%25D0%2590%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D1%2582%25D0%25B0">Anita Borg</a> herself.  The girls were able to personally meet with the winners of the scholarship and ask questions to representatives of Google. <br><br>  We asked three laureates to share with us their stories of participation in the competition for scholarships: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/632/7fe/c27/6327fec2782d43fa1d8d99b13fa15419.png"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h6>  Tell us a little about yourself ... </h6><br>  <b>Anna</b> : I graduated from the Faculty of Mathematics and Mechanics of the Novosibirsk State University.  Now I work at the Institute of Computational Technologies and prepare to defend my PhD thesis.  I am engaged in mathematical modeling and optimization methods for solving inverse problems. <br><br>  <b>Elena:</b> I graduated from the Faculty of Bioinformatics of the Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology.  At the moment, my work is related to the analysis of biological data.

      <b>Anastasia:</b> I graduated from the Moscow Engineering and Physics Institute, Department of Experimental and Theoretical Physics, Department of Applied Mathematics.  From the sixth year I work at the Institute of System Programming of the Russian Academy of Sciences, where I started with projects on testing workflow systems, and later transferred to a project to develop a tool for automated testing of Internet protocols. <br><br><h6>  How did you find out about the scholarship named after Anita Borg and why did you decide to apply for participation? </h6><br>  <b>Anna:</b> I learned about scholarships through announcements at our university when this program started in Russia in 2008.  My friends told me that I fit in all parameters, and I decided to apply.  Before doing this, I looked on the Internet biography of Anita Borg.  I was very inspired by her story.  I wanted to prove, first of all, to myself, that I can do something in the field of technology. <br><br>  <b>Elena:</b> I saw an ad for this scholarship even before I started studying.  I was attracted by the element of competition, which I liked even while participating in school competitions.  Two years later I became a finalist! <br><br>  <b>Anastasia:</b> I heard about the scholarship from a representative of Google, who spoke at the ISP RAS with a presentation.  I was just a graduate student and became interested in the program.  At first, after reading the reviews and a short biography of the winners, I was afraid that my chances are small.  But I decided that I should not assess the chances - I should try.  In the worst case, it will be just a rewarding experience and the opportunity to try again. <br><br><h6>  How has the scholarship influenced you and your further development? </h6><br>  <b>Anna:</b> I became the finalist of the contest 3 times.  Success gave me confidence, helped in the future to boldly take part and win in other competitions, participate in international technical conferences. <br><br>  <b>Elena:</b> Having received a scholarship, I became more confident in my abilities and found additional motivation to continue working on myself, especially on my programming skills.  I also strengthened my leadership skills: I am now co-chairing a committee that supports the development of biotechnology and helps young scientists build a successful career after graduating from university. <br><br>  <b>Anastasia:</b> Before participating in the program, I was not confident enough in myself and my own capabilities.  Now, to be honest, I also sometimes doubt my abilities, but after meeting with other scholars, it turned out that I was not alone. <br><br><h6>  What was the highlight of the event for you at which all the fellows met? </h6><br>  <b>Anna:</b> I was inspired by examples of new scientific and software developments, modern approaches to the organization of the working space and time of employees, the relaxed atmosphere for communication with professionals in their field.  After meeting with other fellows, I have a strong motivation to work hard all next year. <br><br>  <b>Elena:</b> Getting to know so many interesting people was a real inspiration for me.  I also liked the presentation about the many-sided technical problems studied at various universities in Europe, the Middle East and Africa. <br><br>  <b>Anastasia:</b> The main thing was the atmosphere of meeting with a lot of talented girls from different cultures and nationalities.  There were interesting discussions of various approaches to education, industry and life in general. <br><br><h6>  What advice would you give to Russian students who would like to become the next finalists on the Anita Borg scholarship? </h6><br>  <b>Anna:</b> Do not be afraid and believe in yourself!  The competition is won by the same girls as you.  I wish you to achieve your goals and do exactly the work that you like, despite the social prejudices. <br><br>  <b>Elena:</b> Approach the process with enthusiasm and sincerity!  Take part in interesting projects at your university, study hard and be sure to highlight your key achievements in your resume. <br><br>  <b>Anastasia:</b> When applying for a scholarship, use charts and pictures in your essays to emphasize the main point.  The essay should be read many times, trying to remove all unnecessary.  Ask someone from your loved ones to read and evaluate the writing. <br>  Well, if you don‚Äôt immediately win, don‚Äôt despair, try again! <br><br>  <i>An application for <a href="http://www.google.com/anitaborg/emea/">the Anita Borg scholarship from Google</a> can be submitted by girls (undergraduate and graduate students) who are studying in universities in the 2014-2015 academic year.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>Deadline for submission of applications: Monday, February 17, 2014</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>Additional information about scholarships from Google is available at: <a href="http://www.google.com/students/scholarships">www.google.com/students/scholarships</a> .</i> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/211314/">https://habr.com/ru/post/211314/</a></p>
