  <section class="page js-page"><h1>At least 65 people saved thanks to drone last year</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  According to a report published by DJI, drones helped and continue to help save lives on five continents. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/es/dq/zr/esdqzr_z0m2taqbhpl8jyuizs8k.jpeg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  As noted in a press release published on April 30 by DJI, during the past year at least 65 people were saved with the help of drones.  Information from agencies and public security agencies from around the world was used to create the report, and it contains information on 27 emergencies that occurred on five continents. <br><br>  A full report on the use of drones in rescue operations around the world over the past year (More Lives Saved: A Year Of Drone Around The World) can be <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/7f6lhzz5mt1fcz0/More%2520Lives%2520Saved%25202018.pdf%3Fdl%3D0">downloaded here</a> .  The report emphasizes how the improvement of unmanned technology, their rapid implementation by emergency services and the adaptation of the standards associated with flights, help to expand the scope of use of drones when performing important public safety tasks.

      Considering the data of the <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/gruiqaua826sr03/Lives%2520Saved%25202017.pdf%3Fdl%3D0">previous report</a> published last year, at least 124 people were saved with DJI drone in different parts of the world.  The new report contains information on dumping rescue buoys from drones to swimmers in Australia and Brazil who are in a difficult position, finding unconsciously affected in sub-zero temperatures in England and America, and finding stray tourists in the fields, river areas and mountains. <br><br>  ‚ÄúDrones allow rescuers to find missing people and deliver supplies of food and life jackets, reducing the time needed for search and response from several hours to several minutes,‚Äù said Brendan Schulman, vice president of policy and legal affairs at DJI.  ‚ÄúIf laws and regulations allow public security services to easily use drones, rescuers have more opportunities to save time and money, protect their personnel, and most importantly, save people from dangerous situations.‚Äù <br><br>  According to the report, over the past year, on average, more than one person per week was saved with the help of drones, 18 victims were found with the help of thermal chambers capable of capturing the heat of the human body even in poor lighting conditions and in the presence of obstacles. <br><br>  In one case, the Lincolnshire police in England arrived at night at the scene of a car accident on a rural road, but could not find the driver.  Thanks to the thermal imaging drone, the driver was found in a ditch remote from the accident site.  Dramatic shots were taken of how the police were looking for a victim.  <a href="https://youtu.be/jTuFTQhnN-o">Here</a> you can watch a video of the rescue operation. <br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jTuFTQhnN-o" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  The report provides information about people from the USA, Canada, Australia, China, Malta, France and Brazil.  There is no data about those rescued in Russia and the CIS countries.  Please, if you have information about the documented cases of saving lives to someone in Russia or the CIS, write in the comments. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/374469/">https://habr.com/ru/post/374469/</a></p>
