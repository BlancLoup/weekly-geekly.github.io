In particular, it was about updating vSAN 6.7 update 3. </blockquote><br>  vSAN is a vSphere-integrated repository designed for deployment in a private and public cloud.  It allows you to abstract from the hardware disks and work with resource pools without worrying about where the virtual machine data is located.  Starting with vSAN 6.7, developers have taught the system to use the infrastructure more efficiently - the tool automatically frees up space, reducing the total cost of ownership of the storage. <br><br>  VMware representatives say that the new version of vSAN has greater I / O performance (by 20‚Äì30%), compared to its predecessor.  Also in the updated system, we solved part of the problems associated with vMotion migration, replication and snapshots.  These operations have become much more stable - now the situation with the "sticking" of virtual machine disks during migration and the loss of changes during the creation and removal of snapshots will be much less common.  The company's engineers promise to eradicate them permanently in the next vSAN 6.7 updates.

      The IT giant is also working on the introduction of a full-featured support for the All-NVMe disk infrastructure and the optimization of vSAN for working with SSD arrays.  Among the priorities of the speakers of the company highlighted the increase in performance and data protection in case of failures of storage elements.  First of all, it was about increasing the speed of rebuilding the array, working with the Redirect-On-Write mechanism and minimizing the number of disk operations between media on the network.  Also mentioned was the on-line data recovery between cluster nodes and minimizing latency. <br><br><blockquote>  <i>‚ÄúVSAN is getting smarter, there are more and more intelligent functions related to determining the location of data and optimizing routes during their transfer.</i>  <i>These aspects are important for the operation of features such as DRS, vMotion, and others. ‚Äù</i> </blockquote><br>  At the same time, artificial intelligence systems are actively being introduced into the vSAN product.  Its tasks include monitoring the status of disk subsystems, their automatic ‚Äúdisinfection‚Äù, as well as notifying administrators and drawing up reports / recommendations. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/3o/n8/vl/3on8vlefras5eruufq0ltnrw6is.jpeg"><br><br><h2>  About data recovery </h2><br>  On one of the VMware EMPOWER 2019 panels, the speakers separately discussed the possibilities of the updated NSX-T 2.4, designed for network virtualization and aggregation of virtual networks of data centers.  It was about the capabilities of the platform in the context of emergency data recovery (Disaster Recovery). <br><br>  VMware is actively working on its own DR solutions in single-site and multi-site environments.  The company managed to almost completely abstract virtual resources (machines, disks, networks) from physical platforms.  Already, NSX-T can work with multi-cloud, multi-hypervisor and bare-metal nodes. <br><br>  The tool reduces data recovery time and the number of manual operations associated with the reconfiguration of the infrastructure (IP addresses, security policies, routing, and parameters of the services used) after migration to new equipment, when many technical conditions change. <br><br><blockquote>  <i>‚ÄúRestore all settings manually for a long time, plus there is a human factor - the system administrator can forget or ignore a number of mandatory steps.</i>  <i>Such errors lead to failures in the entire IT infrastructure or individual services.</i>  <i>Also, the human factor adversely affects the achievement of availability and speed of data recovery ( <a href="https://iaas-blog.it-grad.ru/funkcionalnost/posleavarijnoe-vosstanovlenie-kak-usluga-disaster-recovery-as-a-service/">SLA / RPO / RTO</a> ) "</i> </blockquote><br>  For these reasons, VMware is actively promoting the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãlogical micro-segmentation of infrastructure, orchestration and automation of recovery procedures.  Particular emphasis is placed on the implementation of artificial intelligence systems.  They are already appearing in IT giant solutions like VMware NSX Cluster Management, Storage Replication, as well as Geneve virtual switches and tunnels.  The latter came to replace the NSX-V VXLAN and is the basis on which the work of the NSX-T is built. <br><br>  Representatives of the company talked about the smooth transition from VMware NSX-V to NSX-T <a href="https://habr.com/ru/company/it-grad/blog/452840/">on the first day of the conference</a> .  The main feature of the new solution is the fact that it is not tied to vCenter / vSphere, so it can be used as an independent solution for various types of infrastructure. <br><br>  We visited VMware special test boards where we were able to evaluate the performance of the products described above in practice.  It turned out that despite the wide functionality, it is quite simple to manage the SD-WAN and NSX-T solutions.  We managed to deal with everything ‚Äúon the fly‚Äù, without resorting to the help of consultants. <br><br>  It is good that VMware pays attention to the tasks related to security and data recovery.  Today, as a rule, third-party systems are responsible for their solution, which leads to compatibility problems (especially when infrastructural conditions change) and additional costs from customers.  New VMware solutions will increase the stability of the processes occurring in the IT infrastructure. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/bq/zs/mp/bqzsmpqwmzgiryrkxamgl0ai5k4.jpeg"><br><br><hr><br>  <i>Live broadcast from VMware EMPOWER 2019 in our Telegram channel:</i> <i><br><br></i> <ul><li>  <a href="https://teleg.run/iaasblog/230">About the possibilities of the updated NSX-T 2.4</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://teleg.run/iaasblog/229">Storage - a new level of virtualization</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://teleg.run/iaasblog/227">Online Revolution: SD-WAN by VeloCloud</a> </li></ul></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/453346/">https://habr.com/ru/post/453346/</a></p>
