However, the ‚Äúexcursion into history‚Äù shows that most models of secure phones are not intended ‚Äúto be worn in a suit‚Äù. <br><br>  I was looking for an everyday phone with characteristics like those on which trucks pass in crash tests.

      Obviously, there have been many attempts to create such gadgets.  For example, business phones Sonim 2.1 Spirit, Motorolla Defy and some more.  But judging by the reviews on the same Y.Market, the products turned out to be not quite suitable for business needs (they curse weight, thickness and small screens). <br><br>  Today I want to talk about the Outfone BD618 secure phone that I found in the Ukrainian online store - it‚Äôs strange that there‚Äôs not enough information about it on the web.  The Russian site of the company turned out to be completely empty and sad, but I did not even find the required model on .com. <br><br>  Promotion of goods is prohibited by the rules, so I place it in an offtopic. <br><br>  Under the cut - a lot of photos, 2 videos and a detailed description of the model. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Here's a cute one in a box: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/118/c59/b4d/118c59b4d1afc3a8a56cf486ec456f7c.jpg"><br><br><h4>  Components and specifications </h4><br><ul><li>  body combined metal + durable ABS plastic scratch-resistant </li><li>  Two GSM and WCDMA SIM cards (3G Internet) </li><li>  the two halves of the housing are interconnected by 8 bolts and sealed with rubber gaskets </li><li>  reliable metal back cover of the battery compartment, between the cover and the case there is a special hermetic seal that protects the battery compartment from moisture and dust </li><li>  does not slip wet in hand (plastic is correct) </li><li>  double flash on high-brightness diodes </li><li>  for greater tightness, the plug of technological holes is made of two component material with an ideal fit of the joints of the connection </li><li>  1.5 mm thick Gorilla Glass with no pressure on the screen </li><li>  microphone and speaker are protected by a special microfibre membrane that protects from water and dust, but perfectly transmits sound </li><li>  for greater tightness, the external mechanical control buttons are made in a reduced size and are recessed into the case.  However, this does not affect their usability. </li><li>  body color is not deep brown with metallic accents </li><li>  even if you strongly squeeze the phone in your hand, no squeak appears </li><li>  weight 148 grams </li><li>  dimensions are 65.5x126x10.8 mm </li><li>  <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/IP_%2528%25F1%25F2%25E5%25EF%25E5%25ED%25FC_%25E7%25E0%25F9%25E8%25F2%25FB_%25EE%25E1%25EE%25EB%25EE%25F7%25EA%25E8%2529">IP67</a> standard protection and complies with the military standard <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIL-STD-810">MIL-STD 810G</a> - this means ‚Äúwithstands a fall from a height of 2 meters onto a concrete slab and a half-hour immersion in water at a meter depth‚Äù </li><li>  Android 4.0.4. </li><li>  independent GPS module </li><li>  extra battery </li><li>  thermometer, barometer, altimeter, flashlight </li></ul><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/4d3/90d/6b4/4d390d6b41bf3cec75da3763b1663d70.jpg"><br><br><h4>  GPS module </h4><br>  About the GPS module needs to be said separately.  Supports A-GPS technology to accelerate the ‚Äúcold start‚Äù of a GPS receiver.  True, standard maps for Android OS devices offer far from the most convenient navigation with a permanent connection to the Internet.  To search for a newly opened boutique in his hometown, such navigation is quite suitable.  But for a trip by car during the holidays is not the best option.  So travel lovers will have to purchase a normal navigation program.  However, in the phone, which is shown in the review, the maps are already loaded (the <a href="http://rugged.com.ua/">Ukrainian store</a> tried, where it was purchased) - Navitel Navigator with maps of Ukraine, Russia, Belarus and Kazakhstan. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/567/343/a99/567343a999d03c8c7dbfa986fedc05ec.jpg"><br><br><h4>  Connection </h4><br>  For the implementation of the main function, for which, in fact, it is intended, a GSM receiver for two SIM cards is installed on the Outfone BD618.  The smartphone can work in networks GSM / GPRS / EDGE, 850/900/1800/1900 MHz, as well as in 3G (900/2100 MHz).  Wireless Wi-Fi 802.11 b / g / n allows not only to connect to a Wi-Fi router, but also to the smartphone itself to act as an access point.  If necessary, you can use Bluetooth version 2.1, which will ensure high-quality operation of the headset or data transfer from phone to phone.  The connection to the computer is made via the microUSB connector, so the devices exchange files. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/40e/aa6/760/40eaa67609cf9d3be41f3567b02d398c.jpg"><br><h4>  Battery </h4><br>  The smartphone has a 1500 mAh battery.  The battery is not the most powerful, but it is fully capable of powering the device for one or two days, depending on the mode of operation.  But at the same time, the Outfone BD618 bundle, as well as in the Nokia business models, offers two batteries, that is, the lifespan is doubled. <br><br>  Still a battery like the Philips Xenium ... <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/b9c/397/096/b9c397096a2cb7026bb17d79c9b69a6b.jpg"><br><br><h4>  System </h4><br>  Dual-core processor Cortex A9 with a frequency of 1.2 GHz.  For the needs of the operating system, 0.5 GB of RAM is allocated, and only 4 GB is available for user data.  A bit small, but the issue is solved by installing microSD memory cards up to 32 GB.  All this is controlled by modern Android OS version 4.0.4.  This will allow you to use all the variety of applications and services from Google.  Among the standard pre-installed applications Gmail, Youtube, Gtalk, Gmaps.  The Google Play store, which has more than 600,000 applications, is always open to download various multimedia content. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/e06/a39/2d0/e06a392d04555bb70af9b46452ef4bbf.jpg"><br><h4>  Additional features and equipment </h4><br>  Among the additional features of the Outfone BD618 are those that are useful in travel and entertainment (thermometer, barometer, altimeter and compass), and those without which you can not do in everyday life (MP3 / MP4, FM radio, flashlight).  The smartphone is standard enough.  The basic kit includes: phone, extra battery, wired stereo headset, USB cable and charger. <br><br>  Those who do not bother with brands and brand awareness, and are looking for a device for their needs, may well be suitable. <br><br><h4>  Video </h4><br>  Check how "sinking." <br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/tMeqrUZ6QaY%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700019,15700186,15700191,15700253,15700255&amp;usg=ALkJrhixEISUqc_m0gwjCARBzw1EJlazfg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  We throw from pent height. <br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/vP55B9SrtBc%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700019,15700186,15700191,15700253,15700255&amp;usg=ALkJrhjSuPxY9hJCyW1azvwpR11Rhxx0LA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/169217/">https://habr.com/ru/post/169217/</a></p>
