  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Homemade budget sub for movie</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><h4>  Why all this was done? </h4><br>  For a long time I thought about making a ‚ÄúBUHalki‚Äù for a movie in the form of an active subwoofer on the LFE channel. <br>  As LF 30GD-2 (LF from S90), as such are available and are lying idle in large quantities (well, there are pennies in the right places, so it's not a pity).  Well, I am a rogue :), I feel sorry for a decent sub more than 15 000 p.  give away.  According to calculations, I decided to choose a 6A bandpass.  Only he gives a very decent return and low boundary frequency.  According to the estimated frequency response -3db - 24 -63 Hz.  Assembled sub looks like this. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/04e/c8e/dea/04ec8edea88923c79e933d9e0a99ea8d.jpg"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/22f/754/542/22f754542947aacb35e68812f6b2ced9.jpg"><br><br>  The quality of the photo is mostly terrible, since I photographed it on the phone (well, I didn‚Äôt have a soap box or a mirror at that time). <br>  Who cares welcome under cat.  There are a lot of phot. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h4>  Design </h4><br>  The overall design is very similar to the well-known structure in the internet. <br>  This is an example of the appearance from one site (I will not mention the authorship of the picture, because I don‚Äôt remember where I took the photo, if anyone knows, write in a personal, put a link).  Naturally sizes will be completely different. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/a4a/8de/bde/a4a8debde9e8eb9cf4f05a1d6ab77f97.jpg"><br>  For the manufacture of structures you need to know or get the parameters of a particular speaker.  They are called <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259F%25D0%25B0%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B5%25D1%2582%25D1%2580%25D1%258B_%25D0%25A2%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BB%25D1%258F_%25E2%2580%2594_%25D0%25A1%25D0%25BC%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BB%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B0">Thiel's Parameters ‚Äî Small</a> .  If you don‚Äôt know what it is, then google and wiki help you, everything is measured quite simply, the software and methods goof with a bang.  Not all software is free, but I will say that you can measure it with an accurate voltmeter, accurate scales, clay, generator and amplifier.  Googled by the "method of added mass".  I used the method of additional weight, but I automated the measurements with the appropriate software (the name is not indicated because the software is paid, but we in Russia who need that one will find everything;)). <br>  It makes no sense to bring the measured parameters, because each speaker is unique and the assembly of the structure according to ‚Äúalien parameters‚Äù will not lead to anything good.  How to say about the dynamics of the times of the USSR, so as not to be rude ... <br>  I have 4 woofers and all have completely different parameters, although they are of the same brand. <br>  <b>For those who want to point out and ‚Äúsay‚Äù that you cannot achieve ‚Äúhigh-quality‚Äù sound from the bandpass, I would repeat once again that the sub was going to watch movies and sound the LFE channel, in which basically only effects occur.</b>

If it is interesting to someone, I can put it in Sprint Layout format. <br>  As the terminal amplifier chose an amplifier on the TDA7294 with adjustable output impedance. <br>  Scheme and description <a href="http://www.electroclub.info/invest/tda7294/r_out.htm">here</a> .  Signet used by the author.

There is also a Linkwitz corrector on the board, but it is not decoupled, since it is not needed for processing a bandpass.  On the pictures, the boards are not washed off from the flux, so these are ‚Äúbeautiful‚Äù. <br><br>  Terminal amplifier <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/4fb/1d9/cfb/4fb1d9cfbab0a7b3c7e6bb2c15600b1d.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/ee3/d0f/257/ee3d0f257d9783bdb09eb8578907d48f.jpg"><br>  Preamplifier <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/7d8/1c4/5f7/7d81c45f772c98e89d277e049667bba0.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/def/c5d/7c1/defc5d7c1f34ec0606e419a90dd3703a.jpg"><br><br>  Kit pick up the subwoofer <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/87b/ed3/8af/87bed38af42dae1e050f26243b0157ed.jpg"><br><br>  Take a piece of aluminum mark and make the back panel of the amplifier unit <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/280/3a0/cdb/2803a0cdb993f34ae2ccae29139cc293.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/4da/450/30e/4da45030ee7cebc1170da5706423059c.jpg"><br><br>  Do not forget about the fusible insert, as a radiator, something from the stocks from AMD <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/f79/9f7/465/f799f746504c5474f13f609cd1e012b0.jpg"><br><br>  Terminal amplifier board <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/102/cef/606/102cef606e9394469f6712c29de85b14.jpg"><br><br>  Made all connections <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/29f/294/4b0/29f2944b04541cf940631f9fe60d4108.jpg"><br><br>  Food from some old trance, again motannogo themselves.

From them it is clear that such a sub will not decorate the apartment.  Well, nothing we will fix it. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/673/935/68a/67393568a5a85ec1dadaee0fc97e7bb6.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/c42/0d0/2f9/c420d02f9724d4832599c7e360aca1b3.jpg"><br>  Without cover <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/111/920/49e/11192049e6150ead713d90ace4d5981a.jpg"><br><br>  He took out a vibrating grinder, putted holes in the screws, leveled the casing and began to glue the adhesive on the light wood.  At first I bought a self-adhesive for pasting in one layer.  Initially, the idea was a light body and black matte details.  After the first layer, it became clear that one layer is very small. <br>  First layer <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/3d2/59c/52b/3d259c52bafad77cbbb94a29cd1438bc.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/f36/109/320/f3610932003ad53f9e787028f53c0f72.jpg"><br>  I tried to cover the bottom with varnish, it became clear that one layer just shines through. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/e5b/321/ac3/e5b321ac37b26da3b73df9593397e78e.jpg"><br><br>  I had to go to the store again for the film.  The second layer stuck more fun, as the wife helped.  Four hands glue much easier. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/fe1/52d/8e8/fe152d8e8f17c715cbc3d811a7571c66.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/7d8/4b4/50f/7d84b450f9d6c19676697bee7c0bb7f0.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/80d/b6b/ecb/80db6becb3a3e9d9df09e2fdbd2ad59d.jpg"><br><br>  After two layers, the film began to varnish.  I do not remember the brand of varnish now, I remember that it was quick-drying and seemed to be diluted with acetone.  It cost about 50 rubles per jar because it is overdue :), but we don't care about rogue. <br>  Two coats of varnish <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/0f8/307/546/0f830754666427b37fca2b2d9c9a012d.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/080/bd2/b03/080bd2b034b43885da383c1c8491eef7.jpg"><br><br>  After drying it looks like this. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/24b/a93/fe1/24ba93fe13eb95355dbb64a03a9b28fd.jpg"><br><br>  Nearer <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/ad6/cf2/2c2/ad6cf22c2bbd4027cb1eb33f76128a63.jpg"><br><br><h4>  How much does it cost? </h4><br>  600 r - sawed me the details on the case + material + delivery to the house. <br>  100 r - screws. <br>  120 p - timber <br>  250 r - pipes of fazikov + the connector for connection in the end turned out to be superfluous and there are many pipes, 50 p. Would be enough. <br>  50 r - sealant (expired) <br>  50 p - plasticine <br>  200 r - 2 pcs TDA7294 (one burned by stupidity by confusing polarity) <br>  200 r various small parts of which were not available. <br>  120 p variable resistors with handles <br>  50 r varnish (overdue) <br>  200 r 5 meters of self-bonding <br>  100 r skin <br>  85 r paint black matte <br>  70 r sewer pipe <br><br>  <b>Total 2160 p., Like I forgot nothing</b> <br><br>  free - brought a cardboard tube for a fazik <br>  free - woofer <br>  free tool <br><br><h4>  Some calculations and reflections </h4><br>  The design pressure is about 109 dB in the operating range, with a power input of 50 watts.  I have long believed I can lie.  Calculations in haste <br><br>  70 watts pressure here, as you can see there is a slope as the din actually works below the resonant frequency, but according to the schedule it does not go beyond the limits of the allowable stroke even by 20 Hz <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/0cd/cd3/50d/0cdcd350d6304560335b0b46bf0deb24.png"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/00b/fd4/bb4/00bfd4bb4751500e855d10e5a97ac203.png"><br><br>  100 W the situation is the same <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/b3b/6da/0d5/b3b6da0d5a68177131c568105926f0ab.png"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/f7e/d04/cc7/f7ed04cc7296cceca3260585bdd08b18.png"><br><br>  I looked for the sake of interest that it is possible to pump into a din and 200 W and there will be no travel limit at 20 Hz.  You can get up to 18 Hz to play a pipe.  But is there a natural question? Do you need such power?  On impressions when there was no separate amp swinging it with a 25-watt industrial amp, if done fully, it is very, very loud.  I only switch it on to full when I want to show someone all the power to boast.  So to say ChSV to amuse :) But in this mode you will not listen for a long time, all that can be shaken and glass jingles, powerfully in one word. <br><br>  <b>PS</b> The constructions have been made for a year already, I did it for 3 months in my mood, for my pleasure. <br>  Was it worth it or not?  I think yes.  The bass is very low and deep.  Because of the design, the sub is played very softly, he cannot play a sharp attack, and he doesn‚Äôt need it, but all the LFE effects are just to cheer, all listeners were wildly delighted.  Despite the fact that the sub is spiked, the walls and floor still vibrate noticeably creating an effect not worse than in cinemas (it would be better to remove the glass bounce). <br>  Recently, I donated a dynamic head from an autosub, I will do one more, but this time a closed case and with Linkwitz proofreader. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/148500/">https://habr.com/ru/post/148500/</a></p>
