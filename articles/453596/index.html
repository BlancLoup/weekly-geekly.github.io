  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Fraudsters and EDS - all very bad</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/wr/ya/rd/wryardwtfgwjqjtt_nfmb5vbllc.jpeg" align="right"><br><p>  Recently, the public circled the <a href="https://habr.com/ru/news/t/452292/">news about the first case of the sale of an apartment by fraudsters using EDS and falsifying documents</a> .  When I read such news before, I always perceived detachedly, as if this could not happen to me, but I was mistaken.  And now I can say that at risk of fraudsters, everyone, alas, is even habrovchane. </p><a name="habracut"></a><br><p>  Although in my case the situation is simpler, I did not rewrite the apartment, but it is much more common - my wife and I, without our knowledge, became the directors of several LLCs.  As we were told in the Ministry of Internal Affairs, they have such cases ‚Äúonly this week 17 items‚Äù.  I remind you that signing documents using EDS is equivalent to signing with a handwritten signature legal entity.  or nat.  therefore, it would seem that the issue of issuing such EDS should be as secure as possible, but unfortunately now in Russia such signatures are issued by ordinary commercial organizations, which are controlled only by issuing licenses to MinComSvyaz.  And <a href="https://habr.com/ru/news/t/453208/">as practice has shown</a> , often it only needs a picture of the passport and the number of SNILS, which any employer, bank, and other organizations have, to which such documents are forced. </p><br><p>  So how was it.  I had a mortgage in one green bank.  On the occasion of the birth of my second child, I decided to take advantage of a new subsidy for the mortgage rate of 6%, especially since I had long wanted to refinance from 12% at a lower interest rate.  By the way, initially the mortgage was issued to me as the main borrower, and to the spouse as co-borrower, that is, the entire package of documents was with the bank.  In the new bank, the spouse no longer appears, and she did not provide the documents.  Actually, it lasted for about 2 months, and here I am satisfied I am sitting at work, pushing commits to the turnip, and then the call.  ‚ÄúHello, you are the director of such a company?  We want to invite you to open a settlement account with us. ‚ÄùI immediately suspected something was wrong, and got into the Incorporation, and, unfortunately, it started here.  As it turned out, I have two LLCs of 2-week and 3-day freshness, and I am their CEO and founder.  I went to investigate, wrote a statement to the OMVD, wrote statements to the tax department, from which I later learned that the companies were registered using EDS. </p><br><p>  At first, I was very scared that I was slipped some papers in the process of re-issuing, and I probably signed something carelessly.  But when the situation repeated with my wife, who doesn‚Äôt sign anything anywhere, but is sitting with the child at home, it became clear that it‚Äôs about personal data leakage and the illegal production of digital signature.  And then began the succession of beating thresholds of various instances - the Ministry of Internal Affairs, the Prosecutor‚Äôs Office, the DAEC, the Tax Department, Roskomnadzor, the Presidential Administration, the court: </p><br><ol><li>  Through the police - numerous denials of a criminal case, due to the absence of a crime event.  That is, if briefly, then "when they kill you, then come."  Since so far no one has put forward financial demands for me, there is no crime event. </li><li>  In the tax area, they did everything according to the regulations, here is a statement, here it is signed with the signature ‚Äúwe have no reason to refuse to register an LLC‚Äù.  They only made a note that ‚ÄúAccording to the Federal Tax Service, the information is unreliable,‚Äù but firms still operate.  Also, upon request, we were given information about the certifying center - both my wife and I had the same CA located in Tomsk (of course, we have never even been close there). </li><li>  Through Roskomnadzor, they requested information from the certifying center, they provided them with an answer that they allegedly have documents from me, and since they do not reveal the authenticity of the documents, contact the court. </li></ol><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Documents</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/rn/1n/i3/rn1ni3cgal6muy3g1v4thl6e2ee.jpeg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/z9/lh/dk/z9lhdkqwqzqota_uvdfdz2mcge0.jpeg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/hj/bq/0b/hjbq0bmgpnjyvds99zc00hf1u_y.jpeg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/4l/wv/4r/4lwv4r8_r1ibx3pglnqaik4phfc.jpeg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/qj/da/_h/qjda_hz2jt1nkxi6kdmrk9sxzx0.jpeg"></p></div></div><br><p>  Actually, now the court, and here, too, is not so simple.  But the trouble, as they say, does not come alone, I received two letters at my old address, from a collection agency, demanding the return of the money that had been taken from two microfinance organizations.  Then I also had to write a statement to the police, while there was silence on them. </p><br><h2 id="nemnogo-suhih-faktov">  Some dry facts </h2><br><ol><li>  Old passport scans have flowed out - old registration addresses are featured everywhere. </li><li>  The scan of his wife's passport in the process of renewal was stored only in the green bank, and was not provided anywhere else, which means that the leak was either through an employee of this bank, or through the person who removed the burden in the rosreestre, or through the person who accepted the documents in the MFC. </li><li>  The state duty for registration of LLCs was paid by a certain gentleman with a non-Russian surname. </li></ol><br><h2 id="kak-ot-etogo-zaschititsya">  How to protect against this? </h2><br><p>  Unfortunately, there is no protection in all spheres, since with the introduction of e-government there are more and more places where operations can be carried out using EDS.  But, in particular, it is possible to protect oneself from registration of legal entities using EDS.  There is a so-called ‚Äú38th form‚Äù, and to be more precise, form 38001, by filling out which, you can prohibit registration of legal entities.  persons without personal presence.  True, it will be necessary to fill it in and take it personally to the registering authority (in Moscow it is tax 46), and as I understand it, it limits it only in this region, although I could be wrong. </p><br><p>  Unfortunately, there is a legislative hole, which is used by fraudsters, and until they tighten their control over the issue of EDS, such situations will only happen more often. </p></div>
