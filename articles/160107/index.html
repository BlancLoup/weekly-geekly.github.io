There are no links to the most paid exchanges or to customers who are willing to pay even for small opus.  If you're here for this - just close the window. <br>  There will be just a small excerpt of my personal life, described in my own language. <br><br>  Once it happened that I became unemployed.  Omit the details of my dismissal and proceed directly to the story of what happened after.  The first thing I spent two months doing absolutely-nothing-not-doing.  This is a great job, especially when payments from the previous job are still going on, there is no debt anywhere, and life seems joyful and easy.  However, the money began to run out, and a well-paying job in my profile on the horizon did not disdain (and I was not looking, to be honest).  I thought about making money on the Internet. <a name="habracut"></a>

      Of course, copywriting caught my eye not immediately, but one very old account on a rather popular resource gave me an idea - why not try it?  I write well, I know Russian well, people read and rejoice - this is the key to a successful copywriter! <br>  So I thought, and I was sure of it. <br><br>  My first plus I think is that before writing articles, I started counting profits and costs.  So to say, began to make a business plan.  I calculated as follows: <br><ul><li>  On average, one thousand characters in a simple article cost $ 1.5.  So, if you write articles on 2'000 characters, you can get an average of $ 3 per article. </li><li>  Considering my print speed (about 320 characters per minute) - we get about 10 minutes for one article (in fact, seven and a half, but spaces are not taken into account, and typos are not taken into account). </li><li>  Naturally, we need a break between articles, so we take 150% of the time from writing one article.  15 minutes. </li><li>  The material also needs to be taken from somewhere.  To this I took two hours a day. </li><li>  With an 8-hour working day, you can spend 5 hours writing articles, based on paras.  3 and 4. That is, 20 articles per day. </li><li>  Simple arithmetic - we multiply $ 3 by 20, we get $ 60 per day. </li><li>  Even with a five-day week (21 work shifts per month, on average), we get 21 * 60 = 1260 dollars per month, which is equivalent to 39,000 rubles at a rate of 31 rubles per dollar. </li></ul><br>  Gorgeous. <br><br>  You sit at home, create, invent, write with all your heart, help people, carry light to the masses, so to speak, and you get almost 40 thousand.  Muscovites now probably will say their spiritual "Fe", but it does not matter.  Both my parents together do not get so much, and in fact they are also retired. <br><br>  Just gorgeous. <br><br>  I decided that I would start creating from the beginning of the work week. <br>  <b>***</b> <br>  The first five articles came out with a bang - I got out of the schedule and finished them in 40 minutes, that is, almost twice the plan.  I was on the rise.  Everything worked out.  Articles flew like bullets, a thought flowed like a river - what else could a real copywriter dream of?  Then it went a little harder, because the flow of thoughts has dried up due to something.  Do not think, the themes for the articles, of course, were different, so as not to clog the same head.  However, the idea did not go to the head.  The following five articles I have already finished on schedule, that is, an hour and a quarter.  I decided to take a break to bring my thoughts in order, to be distracted, and generally drink tea. <br><br>  In short - on this day I wrote another article.  No longer could.  I was squeezed like a sponge. <br>  <b>***</b> <br>  The next day, I went straight to the site in the morning to check how many of these 11 written articles I had already bought.  I was unpleasantly surprised - not a single sale.  Moreover, there was not a single click on my articles.  All this I wrote off as an accident, on the first working day of the week, at the Great Random, and so on.  At this point, I realized one fact - the more articles, the more likely that buyers will enter at least one of them (and, of course, will immediately buy).  With redoubled forces, I proceeded to the first article for today. <br><br>  I'll be brief.  Six articles per day. <br>  <b>***</b> <br>  The third day.  Zero sales, four articles.  Hands lower and lower. <br>  <b>***</b> <br>  Fourth day.  Zero sales.  Zero articles.  Hands dropped completely.  The desire to work and create is gone.  Sense of need and self-esteem - below nowhere. <br>  <b>***</b> <br>  Fifth day.  I get up in the morning, I go to the site, the balance is $ 2.89.  ‚ÄúFrom where ?!‚Äù - I check the articles, and for sure!  - one purchased.  Everything, my poverty passed, from today I officially work and earn!  Wrote five more articles.  All the money spent on advertising a loved one on the same site. <br>  <b>***</b> <br>  Two weeks later.  Not a single sale, not a single article, not a single order. <br>  <b>***</b> <br>  Two weeks later.  Not a single sale. <br><br>  Here, friends, I understood.  I understood one simple truth.  A copywriter, like a journalist, for example, is a completely ungrateful profession.  You do something, you try for people, you write beautifully ... And nobody needs beautifully.  No one needs for people.  Beautiful readers only need.  And who are the readers of numerous sites-on-the-knee?  Traffic.  Simple, nobody needs one by one traffic.  We are not interested in the opinion of the unit from the crowd.  We need to organize this whole crowd and direct it in the right direction.  And for this you need a traffic generator, that is, SEO content.  What exactly will be written and how literary it will be is not important to anyone.  It is important how many times the phrase ‚Äúbuy an elephant‚Äù is used in the text about Soviet elephants.  If less than 3% of the text - garbage is, not the article. <br><br>  I propose to draw conclusions to yourselves.  I can only say to myself that since that moment I have not written any more articles.  More than three months have passed.  None of the articles has yet been sold (although I have already reduced the price for them twice already).  I am a copywriter on the text exchange. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/160107/">https://habr.com/ru/post/160107/</a></p>
