AF45m belong to the closed type of headphones with passive noise isolation. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The index ‚Äúm‚Äù in the title means ‚Äúmicrophone‚Äù.  There is also a model AF45 without a microphone with identical sound. <br>  Like the rest of Audiofly‚Äôs headsets, the <a href="http://soundpal.ru/785-0.html">AF45m</a> looks <a href="http://soundpal.ru/785-0.html">smart</a> .

    <img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/6e7/0d8/680/6e70d868059e4d27af7c96700143c21f.jpg"><br><br>  The standard package includes a fabric case with a rigid fixation of the neck, nozzles of different sizes and instructions. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ba5/c21/43c/ba5c2143cb104333ab0f14fb0da1420b.jpg"><br><br>  Nozzle sizes - standard S, M and L, with the most common size of nozzles M two pairs.  On all nozzles there is an inscription Audiofly. <br><br>  The review about <a href="http://geektimes.ru/company/soundpal/blog/245658/">AF56</a> mentioned the importance of the selection of nozzles, but just in case we repeat <br><br>  <i>Each person has his own shape and diameter of the auditory canal, someone has more, someone has less.</i>  <i>The correct choice of nozzles is responsible for the fit and comfort.</i>  <i>If the attachment is chosen larger than the size of the channel, then the depth of landing is insufficient, there is no tight contact and the headphones will just fall out of the ear.</i>  <i>If the nozzle is too small, the result will be the same.</i>  <i>In addition to the unreliable fit, bass is missing due to the gaps between the nozzle and the canal walls.</i>  <i>The optimal selection of nozzles is a guarantee of high-quality sound.</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d68/fdb/2ed/d68fdb2edfba499da684c9ae7e636b40.jpg"><br><br>  The wire AF45m is covered with fabric braid, which provides additional strength. <br><br>  Consumers sometimes have their own ideas about reliability in appearance, based on the experience of owning a limited number of headphones (often budget).  As a rule, the wire is strengthened either with a special synthetic thread (Sennheiser, for example, uses Kevlar in many models) or with the help of an external braid, as is done in the Audiofly AF45.  It is impossible to see or determine the presence and quality of synthetic yarns without opening the wire; accordingly, it is quite reasonable to give preference to models with a fabric braid for new models. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/bb3/81f/f65/bb381ff6508f4b298ee4305bd45b639f.jpg"><br><br>  But this approach is not a panacea, because  the braid and synthetic threads protect only against wire breaks, but do not protect the base of the plug, plug and cams in the headphones cups from kinking.  If at allegedly careful use the wire is constantly frayed somewhere, then no braid will save it.  Here you need to think about what is the cause and eliminate it. <br><br>  <i>In most cases, they save on synthetic threads only in the most budget headphones (or a specific Hi-End).</i>  <i>If the negative about the strength of the wires formed on the basis of headphones for 100 rubles, then it's time to move on to headphones a class higher.</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/2c6/5b1/217/2c65b121713f46c2aa9ed94f760431d1.jpg"><br><br>  Headphones can be worn as a wire down and up (ear fit).  BTE landing is unusual for many, but it is this method that makes it possible to more evenly distribute the load on the wire and minimize cable rubbing.  For higher comfort, you can purchase special ears Sennheiser 529799. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f03/bbc/49f/f03bbc49f1a440a981c76ed04b0a8e2a.jpg"><br><br>  The microphone and the answer button are separated. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ada/c69/7c2/adac697c2f4f4ac7b2f64fc5b1acf3e5.jpg"><br><br>  Thus, the answer button is located in a convenient place at the fork in the wire, and the microphone is located above in the optimal position to receive voice from the left earpiece. <br><br>  For quick blind channel detection, the right earpiece has tactile dots on the cambric. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/877/9e7/7b7/8779e77b765d45d0b3e2fb9835f0bd9e.png"><br><br>  Inside, we use a proprietary speaker with a 11 mm membrane and a neodymium magnet.  For the class of in-ear headphones, this is a large emitter, assuming a confident reproduction of the low-frequency range without distortion. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/fb5/747/a81/fb5747a81f98416ca6ddec15d1ab4c58.jpg"><br><br>  The <a href="http://soundpal.ru/762-0.html">Hidizs AP100</a> , a successful player, was used to assess the sound quality. <br><br>  In AF45, bass and mids are slightly underlined.  High frequencies have good intelligibility and do not have sibilivity.  In AF45, it's just about listening to dance and energetic styles.  The lack of emphasis of high frequencies makes the headphones preferred for use in noisy transport. <br><br>  If we compare the AF45m with the older model <a href="http://soundpal.ru/776-0.html">AF56</a> , then the AF56 does not have such an emphasis in the midbass region, and the lowest frequencies reproduce more confidently.  The high frequencies of the AF56 are more emphasized. <br><br>  Noise isolation and sensitivity at AF45 is at a good level. <br><br>  Measurements in the <a href="http://reference-audio-analyzer.pro/">Reference Audio Analyzer</a> laboratory showed that the headphones have the most popular type of frequency response curve, with a rise in the low frequencies and lower highs with low upper mid-range.  This type of frequency response is most in demand on the street or in a noisy environment. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/52f/d49/63d/52fd4963dbb747808890d4c71d4fb526.png"><br><br>  Due to the calibration of microphones up to 46 kHz, we can note the behavior of headphones in the extended frequency range.  In the high-frequency region, one can observe irregularity of the graph in the form of alternating peaks and dips - this is nothing but resonances inside the ear canal simulator.  The distribution of resonances individually depends on the shape of the ear canal and on the graph should evaluate the curve without peaks and dips. <br><br>  <a href="http://reference-audio-analyzer.pro/report/hp/audiofly-af45m.php">Audiofly AF45m Detailed Report</a> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/de0/794/c45/de0794c458eb47e59d78ab899bd1597f.jpg"><br><br>  Summing up, we can note a good combination of sound, price and appearance.  The headphones use a durable cable.  Having the ‚Äúm‚Äù version with a microphone makes the AF45 headphones a good choice for a smartphone.  Headphone quality is high enough not to be a bottleneck in conjunction with a good portable Hi-Fi player. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/377049/">https://habr.com/ru/post/377049/</a></p>
