  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Email marketing for cloud service</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  For cloud services, email marketing is an important tool that you need to use to get the most out of it.  Email remains one of the main driving forces in marketing and is the basis for creating customer relationships.  Properly configured email marketing can provide a significant increase in customer base.  We want to talk about our practices used in the anti-spam <a href="https://cleantalk.org/">service CleanTalk</a> . <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h3>  Step one.  Letter with details </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/22e/290/6dd/22e2906ddfafb9090c4cafe1ad2c331b.png"><br><br>  Nothing superfluous, nothing distracts the user from the main goal - to use the service to solve his task, only functionality and minimalism.  The letter is sent immediately after registration. 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>

          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});

    <h3>  Step two.  Letter anti-spam report </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/7da/bfe/71a/7dabfe71a17d292cc3b2c9ef11a11625.png"><br><br>  The letter is sent on the 5th day of using the service at 10 am by the user's time.  Until 10 am, many users have time to view all mail, there are no more unread messages, and the probability that our letter will be lost in the total mass decreases. <br><br>  The headline immediately attracts attention, the numbers about spam attacks and the mention of the web site arouse the great interest of the user to open the letter and read the content.  The content of the letter is the statistics of the service and users become familiar with the ability to control the service, there is an understanding that blocked messages will not be lost even with errors. <br><br>  Each digit is a link, clicking on which the user gets to the request detail page, where you can view the IP / email and message content and reasons for blocking. <br><br>  Since other solutions cannot provide such statistics, it is of interest to users: see the correctness of filtering and simply out of curiosity to find out what they write in spam.  After going to the Control Panel, they continue their familiarity with the service. <br><br>  This newsletter is mainly intended for new users, to show them the usefulness of the service and convenience, so the percentage of opening a report is 30-35%, experienced users are viewing statistics without notice. <br><br><h3>  Step three.  Notification of the imminent expiration of the trial period </h3><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/864/887/a01/864887a018f613352fff9bc2cdaa741e.png"><br><br>  The letter is sent on the same day as the anti-spam report, but already at 15:00 by the user's time.  After lunch, users again have time to see all the mail and the probability of losing the letter below. <br><br>  The title of the letter ‚ÄúThis email is about donuts and coffee‚Äù attracts interest and is consistent with the text of the letter without causing irritation.  The title defines the expectations of the text of the letter and it is justified. <br><br>  The letter is intended to inform the user about the imminent completion of the trial period and remind you of the need to pay for the service for further use.  The title and text are designed to mitigate irritation from the need for payment and cause positive emotions.  In the letter itself, we write about what the user ultimately gets for his money.  Spam protection?  But there are other options, but we realize that CleanTalk saves time, which can be spent on more useful things. <br><br>  Shopping is postponed, this is a decrease in conversion.  Therefore, the letter contains an element of urgency, prompting the user to make a decision.  This is a bonus of +3 free months if paid before the end of the trial period, encourages the user to make a decision. <br><br>  <b>About CleanTalk Service</b> <br><br>  <a href="https://cleantalk.org/">CleanTalk</a> is a cloud service to protect websites from spambots.  CleanTalk uses protection methods that are invisible to website visitors.  This allows you to abandon the methods of protection that require the user to prove that he is a person (captcha, question-answer, etc.). </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/301616/">https://habr.com/ru/post/301616/</a></p>
