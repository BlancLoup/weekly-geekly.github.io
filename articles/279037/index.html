  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Tasktop now officially introduced in Russia</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Let me introduce you to our new partner - the Canadian company <a href="http://www.tasktop.com/">Tasktop</a> - whose software we now officially represent, implement and service in Russia.  Tasktop specializes in the integration of systems in one way or another connected with the development of software, for example, development environments, version control systems, automated testing systems, bug trackers, service desks automation systems, etc. ... A very niche business, but more interesting .  Everywhere, where, over time, a motley mosaic of various and absolutely necessary IT products has developed, and where there is a need to combine them into a comprehensive solution, Tasktop solutions can be useful. <br><br><h4>  Strictly speaking, there are exactly 3 products - Tasktop Sync, Tasktop Data and Tasktop Dev. </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/78d/278/2e8/78d2782e8ad140c6aaad730a2239963b.jpg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h5>  Tasktop sync </h5><br>  Tasktop Sync is a process and data synchronization solution consisting of a separate server synchronization service, a set of interfaces to a wide variety of systems, an environment for setting up these interfaces, and a reporting module.  For example, it is required to ensure that the developers found and recorded defects by testers from HP QC to Jira and SBM, and then automatically update the status of the fix.  Actually, the whole highlight is hidden in the implementation of the configuration environment of these interfaces, taking into account the peculiarities of the architecture, data storage structures, API and the appointment of different products from different manufacturers, including mapping of various types of data, user profiles, directories, projects. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">There are many popular and recognizable products in the list of supported integrations:</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  Atlassian JIRA, Atlassian Service Desk, Blueprint, BMC Remedy, Borland StarTeam, Bugzilla, CA, Agile Central, CA Agile Planning, CA Harvest, CA PPM, GitHub Issues, HPE ALM, HPE PPM, HPE Quality Center, IBM Bluemix, IBM Rational ClearQuest, IBM Rational DOORS, IBM Rational DOORS Next Generation, IBM Rational Quality Manager, IBM Rational Requisite Pro, IBM Rational Team Concert, iRise, Jama, Microsoft Project Server, Microsoft Team Foundation Server, Microsoft Test Manager, Microsoft Visual Studio Team Services (VSO), Planview Enterprise, Polarion ALM, Rally, SD Elements, Serena Business Manager, Serena Dimensions Requirements Management, ServiceNow, ServiceNow PPM, ServiceNow SDLC, ThoughtWorks Mingle, Tricentis Tosca, VersionOne, WhiteHat, Zendesk <br></div></div><br>  I want to draw your attention to the fact that this list contains many service automation systems and many development management systems.  It looks like this is not an accident, but an answer to the specific need of the business to clearly control those incidents and / or problems whose correction is in the hands of the developers of application systems.  Another possible scenario for the interaction of the two worlds is configuration management and release management, or, more precisely, the installation of new software versions through the ITIL change management process.

      Is it possible to do without Tasktop Sync when solving such integration tasks?  Of course yes.  What is interesting Tasktop proposal? <br><br><ol><li>  Versatility and uniformity.  One solution can quickly cover all the needs of integrating development tools and management among themselves. </li><li>  Speed ‚Äã‚Äãdecisions.  We find our products in the list of supported integrations, download the version for review and testing, set up synchronization bridges and evaluate the result. </li><li>  Support for various product versions.  Constantly there are new versions of the development tools you use.  In order for information synchronization to continue to work, someone needs to constantly monitor changes that may affect the data exchange processes.  And this is another attack that Tasktop solves. </li><li>  It happens that the need to synchronize products over time disappears.  Tasktop solutions are sold by subscription, which is very convenient for the rapidly changing IT business environment. </li></ol><br><h5>  Tasktop data </h5><br>  Tasktop Data is a solution for gathering information from the various software tools used to develop, build, install and maintain.  By analogy with Tasktop Sync, the administrator configures data collection bridges, but the data is not transferred to another system, but is only aggregated and stored in intermediate storage structures so that, using third-party reporting tools, you can calculate the necessary metrics, build necessary reports, publish information in the information indicators panels for managers at various levels. <br><br><h5>  Tasktop dev </h5><br>  Tasktop Dev is the commercial version of the popular <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/mylyn/">Eclipse Mylyn</a> open source project. <br><br>  Eclipse Mylyn gained popularity among developers in the Eclipse environment by providing a context for managing its tasks and combining this information with audit preservation actions into a version control system. <br><br>  Tasktop Dev includes support for popular commercial version control systems and some additional features, for example, to control the execution time of tasks.  Dev Pro Edition also includes Outlook integration packages, Zendesk, Google Apps, VersionOne (see <a href="http://www.tasktop.com/tasktop-dev">www.tasktop.com/tasktop-dev for the</a> full list), a separate application for installing on the desktop, services for viewing documents in the browser. <br><br>  Revision Dev Enterprise in addition to Pro includes support for Microsoft VisualStudio IDE, but more importantly, the Microsoft TFS repository.  If there is a need to synchronize developer tasks from Jira or SBM to Microsoft TFS task management objects (bug, task, item), then TaskTop Dev makes it easy. <br><br>  By the way, Tasktop Dev Pro is included in the SBM delivery package for free. <br><br>  These are the solutions we are ready to offer our professional developers.  In the near future, our feed will contain articles on setting up Tasktop products for solving practical and educational tasks.  Watch our tape. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/279037/">https://habr.com/ru/post/279037/</a></p>
