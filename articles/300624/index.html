The first edition of the publication was released on February 22, 2016.  The latest release is scheduled for today. <br><br>  As <a href="http://ria.ru/world/20160505/1426896491.html">reported by</a> RIA Novosti, for the first time in 30 years, an exclusively printed daily newspaper appeared in the UK.  The editorial board hoped to prove that the print edition could survive the Internet era. <br><br>  Moreover, the newspaper had a noble goal - to publish only ‚Äúpositive news‚Äù.  Trinity Mirror CEO Simon Fox stated that he saw a niche in the print media market for a 40-page newspaper worth ¬£ 0.50 (for comparison, The Times costs ¬£ 1.40), which would report news from an optimistic and politically neutral point of view. . <a name="habracut"></a>

      But for the general public, which, apparently, and so everything is fine, such news is just boring.  Publishers planned to sell 200,000 copies of The New Day daily, but only 40,000 were able to sell per day. <br><br>  Trinity Mirror described the new edition as an ‚Äúexciting and innovative initiative that builds on our belief in print media.‚Äù  Although the newspaper had pages on social networks, it did not have an online version.  ‚ÄúAlthough The New Day received many favorable reviews and gained many followers on Facebook, its distribution turned out to be below our expectations,‚Äù the publishers <a href="http://www.trinitymirror.com/pressrelease/trading-update/2329">explained</a> . <br><br>  The experts were already skeptical about the prospects of the new newspaper, but few expected that the release of The New Day would be terminated so soon.  The lack of an online version and developed digital channels for newspaper promotion have done their job. <br><br>  ‚ÄúWe tried our best and received tremendous feedback from readers, but the number of these readers was clearly not enough,‚Äù <a href="http://www.interfax.by/news/world/1205699">said</a> newspaper editor Alison Phillips.  Most of the 25 employees of the newspaper will be fired, the rest will be included in the <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Daily_Mirror">Daily Mirror</a> staff, she said. <br><br>  ‚ÄúWe cannot but admire a bold and optimistic attempt to present some kind of novelty on the newspaper market,‚Äù commented the news Jane Martinson, head of <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Guardian">The Guardian‚Äôs</a> media department.  ‚ÄúHowever, it must be admitted that the attempt was not planned properly.‚Äù  According to her, there was not enough news in the newspaper, and the pricing policy was chosen incorrectly. <br><br>  Since 2000, the number of newspapers sold in the UK has almost halved, to 8 million per day.  In February 2016, sales of <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Independent">The Independent were</a> reduced to 55 thousand a day, after which the owner of the newspaper, Yevgeny Lebedev, decided to stop publishing the printed version of the newspaper, <a href="http://www.kommersant.ru/doc/2979785">reminds</a> Kommersant. <br><br>  From March 26, The Independent switched to an exclusively digital format. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/300624/">https://habr.com/ru/post/300624/</a></p>
