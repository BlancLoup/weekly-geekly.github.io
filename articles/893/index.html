  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Who's there? Or unresolved audience research problems</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  If someone has not heard, the other day the League gathered a round table to discuss the problems of calculating the size and quality of the Ukrainian Internet audience.  They invited many, discussed it for a long time, but the answer was never found.  On that and went.  By the way, I didn‚Äôt go there, it was just me and without this round table everything was clear that nothing is shining for our market yet.  From the " <a href="http://www.mi6.com.ua/">bears</a> " <a href="http://www.habrahabr.ru/people/makcumyc/">Max</a> went there, which I briefly told. <br><br>  I will not talk about what was there, of course, but I will express my opinion on this topic. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Now, by and large, we don‚Äôt even have an accurate idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe size of the Ukrainian audience, because  there is no method that would give more or less normal data.  Someone considers the size of the Ukrainian IP-shkami, but this is stupid, because  for various reasons, there will always be less of them than actual users.  Someone counts using surveys and then projects the data to the entire population.  Bigmir thinks with the help of his counter, which has recently stood on many popular sites, and the statistics themselves are not buggy, as they are now.  But none of these methods gives clear data, since  each of them for various reasons large errors.  And it seems to me that in principle there is no normal method, and if it does appear, it will not be very soon. <br><br>  Thus, with the question ‚ÄúHow many of us?‚Äù Everything is clear: ‚ÄúFIG know how much.‚Äù  And why do we need to know this, you might think that this is so important to someone.  It‚Äôs another thing to know "Who is here?"

      In the direction of studying the portrait of the audience of sites, it seems like there have been some recent changes.  Our neighbors have already begun to conduct the first research.  True, they still look like an attempt to draw this portrait with the help of a shaman tambourine and songs around a fire.  Now in Ukraine we have two such shamans, this is Polish Gemius, who made a simplified version of the original for our market, and which no one just wants to put, because  their data are not in demand by advertisers.  And the second shaman is TNS, who asks for his research the amount of money that is not very high for our market. <br><br>  But, as I noted above, as long as our interest in even such shamanic research does not grow from the level of ‚Äúinteresting, but I will not pay,‚Äù I‚Äôm ready to buy, because  without it, neither how ‚Äùnor what round tables will help.  The problem is not that there is no one to count, somehow, but that there is no one to use this data. <br><br>  In my opinion, in the next 3-4 years, you can definitely ‚Äúrelax the bread‚Äù and wait for the Internet audience to grow three times in the beginning, then large advertisers will turn their eyes to this audience, and then the struggle will begin for these advertisers, by cramming them into these studies. <br><br>  In the meantime, you can think of another question: "How to calculate the efficiency?" <br></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/893/">https://habr.com/ru/post/893/</a></p>
