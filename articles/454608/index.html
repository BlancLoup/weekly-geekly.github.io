Operators are reluctant to do this, arguing that they do not have such procedures, this is a deviation from the standard conditions and ‚Äúwhat do you worry about - no one complains with us‚Äù. <br><br>  In such cases, you have to take the initiative in your hands and write the SLA procedure for the Operator, and then painfully coordinate it and knock out the necessary conditions.  Those who had to, or still have to deal with this type of literary slavery - welcome, the topic is boring, but there is no place to go ...

Alas, that all this is exactly what worked SLA with the Operator ... <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/336868/">There are</a> successful articles about SLA on Habr√©, and less successful ( <abbr title="In My Honest Opinion">IMHO</abbr> ), but often they are addressed to the company's internal processes, or are described in general terms, but we also have to deal with Telecom operator, what will he suggest to us on this issue?  Let's talk today about the fixed connection ... <br><br>  And he offers us ‚Äústandard contract terms‚Äù, a section ‚Äúoperator‚Äôs responsibility‚Äù, usually containing a couple of paragraphs.  These two paragraphs are really fairly standard, all almost identical, and all are united by the concept of "1/720". <br><br>  T. about.  if the Operator provides you with fixed-line services for a certain subscription.  payment, and, suddenly, these services will no longer be available, then with a generous supply of the Operator, for <u>each hour of</u> inactivity it will be deducted from the monthly subscription fee by 1/720.  At first glance - cool.  But it quickly comes to an understanding that roughly - there are only 720 hours in a month, and in reality, if the Operator does not provide services - it simply does not charge you a fee, which, you see, is obvious ... and a little offensive.  :) <br><br>  We are not satisfied with such a service, we want the <s>blood to</s> motivate the Operator to work without downtime, and downtime to reduce to a minimum, so we sit down to write SLA. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Traditionally it is necessary to start with water ...</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  <b>1. Procedure for interaction between the Operator and the Company</b> <br>  <i>We briefly describe the indicators of the quality of the services provided, the contacts of the responsible person / group on the part of the Operator.</i> <br>  <b>2. Rules for receiving, registering and processing applications from the Company.</b> <br>  <i>We say that there is the concept of application or Trouble Ticket  ªa, as you prefer.</i>  <i>Describe what is indicated in this application.</i>  <i>We describe that we submit it for example electronically, with soap, from a specific address.</i>  <i>Specify what will be the confirmation of registration of the application</i> <br></div></div><br>  ... and continue to prioritize the urgency of the problem.  This is important, we will use it.  The author of the SLA himself should come up with a number of priorities, but if roughly, there will be at least three of them. <br><br>  Let's take an example, we use the Internet access service and here: <br><br><ol><li>  Internet access is completely absent - this is the ‚Äúzero‚Äù (most important) priority - we will solve this problem as a matter of urgency ... </li><li>  There is access, but the quality is degrading ... Or the speed is significantly short or half of the nodes is not available.  Call it - ‚Äúa problem on the Operator‚Äôs network leads to a decrease in the quality of service provision‚Äù - this priority will be ‚Äúfirst‚Äù. </li><li>  There are other questions ... this priority should also be a problem.  Let it be the "second."  These are bills, additional agreements, acts of reconciliations, and more.  All this should also be addressed within a certain time frame. </li></ol><br>  After determining the priorities, we determine the time to address these issues.  The time factor is very important, on the one hand it is downtime without services (simple business), on the other hand - too short an idle time will be expensive for the Operator.  Here we must try to evaluate soberly and with an eye on other factors. <br><br>  For example, try this: <br><br><ul><li>  Zero priority - solution time not more than 4 hours; </li><li>  The first priority is a solution time of not more than 8 hours; </li><li>  The second priority is the solution time of not more than 24 hours. </li></ul><br>  All this we came up with, that we would <s>punish</s> had a motivating effect on the Operator in the section "Responsibility of the parties." <br><br>  Here we describe that the service availability ratio per month is 99.5%, i.e.  simple services can not exceed 4 hours per month.  We will give the Operator some time for planned work and minor accidents. <br><br>  But!  If these conditions are not met, then now we are writing that for <u>each hour of</u> inactivity over 4 hours per month, the Operator will deduct, for example, 1/100 (recall Operator 1/720) from the monthly subscription fee.  This is 1% per hour - this greatly stimulates the Operator. <br><br>  We looked at a simple example, paper will endure everything, you can come up with any variations.  For example, the availability ratio of 99.00% and 8 hours of free downtime.  Other priorities are described similarly. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">What else can / should be added to SLA</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  <b>3. Regulations for informing the Company of the TT decision</b> <br>  <i>Describe how often and in what ways the Operator informs about the solution of the problem and the timing of its elimination.</i> <br>  <b>4. Escalation Sheets</b> <br>  <i>If your manager at the Operator is sick / unavailable / is behaving badly?</i>  <i>Who to complain?</i>  <i>Document we fix the name and contacts of the manager, his deputies and management.</i>  <i>We indicate critical deadlines when we start complaining about the Operator‚Äôs Guide to the actions (or inaction) of the manager.</i>  <i>By the way, the Operator will ask for a similar escalation list to complain to your Guide :)</i> <br>  <b>5. Contact details for communication</b> <br>  <i>Here we describe in detail all contacts, understanding that it may be necessary to contact extra ... at night ... when nobody reads the mail</i> <br>  <b>6. Areas of responsibility</b> <br>  <i>In whose area of ‚Äã‚Äãresponsibility is the power supply of the Operator‚Äôs equipment located in your server room?</i>  <i>That's right - yours.</i>  <i>It is with the availability of power on the equipment that the operator will begin the conversation on the ‚Äúzero‚Äù priority.</i>  <i>We describe who is responsible for what and where is the limit of responsibility.</i> <br>  <b>7. Scheme of the organization of communication services</b> <br>  <i>It is convenient to have the scheme at hand.</i> <br>  <b>8. Procedure for carrying out planned work by the Operator</b> <br>  <i>On all planned works, on both sides, the Client and the Operator must notify each other in order to avoid unnecessary incidents.</i> <br></div></div><br>  And now, all this ‚Äúwork‚Äù must be coordinated with the Operator, who in turn will fight for every percent and hour.  All trade-offs are governed by the value of the contract. <br><br>  The story turned out a bit crumpled, counter questions are inevitable, I wait for them in the comments.  In general, the question is considered simple - fixed connection.  There was an experience of writing an SLA for corporate mobile communications - that‚Äôs where I had to sweat.  If the reader is grateful and demands continuation, I have no right to refuse. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/454608/">https://habr.com/ru/post/454608/</a></p>
