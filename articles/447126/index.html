More reports, more photos, more emotions and impressions. <br><br> <a href="https://habr.com/ru/company/jugru/blog/447126/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/t0/xh/za/t0xhzaeemvo7swqcpiteut-4ils.jpeg"></a> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Two days from morning to evening (almost literally <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0116367/">‚Äúfrom dawn to dusk‚Äù</a> ), 1600 people (with speakers and <i>JUG.ru</i> team - all 1700) of close age with similar professional interests were held at the Congress Center of the World Trade Center.  When moving around the site and moving from one hall to another during breaks, it was felt that such a number of people was close to the limit in a given conference venue.  We must pay tribute to all involved in the preparation of the event - everything went almost perfectly.  When they entered the hall in advance, there were places; in addition, the video was broadcast to the small fifth hall.  All were fed on time and not offended by the lack of reports for every taste ( <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A5%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B1%25D0%25B0_%25D0%25B8_%25D0%25B7%25D1%2580%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B8%25D1%2589">‚Äúbread and circuses‚Äù</a> ). <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/es/-c/_p/es-c_prhfnbehg3akallttjnzpw.jpeg"></a>

    <h3>  Company stands </h3><br>  Of the sponsors' stands, a lot of attention was attracted by companies whose software products are either used by the majority of conference participants, or potentially a significant part of them may be of interest.  Naturally, first of all, this is the stand of the company <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/">JetBrains</a> (medium shot).  Every day, spending a fair part of the day, using the latest version of <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/">IntelliJ IDEA</a> , you have the deepest respect and gratitude to the company's employees.  At the conference, presentations were made by her employees <a href="https://habr.com/ru/users/lany">Tagir Valeev</a> and <a href="https://habr.com/ru/users/antonarhipov">Anton Arkhipov</a> . <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/0d/rq/89/0drq89pszsjfnm6une7knteatqs.jpeg"></a> <br><br>  A small company (its official name is ‚ÄúProgram Verification Systems‚Äù), the flagship product of which is the <a href="https://www.viva64.com/ru/pvs-studio/">PVS-Studio</a> static code analyzer.  The product recently introduced support for the <i>Java language</i> .  The company is <a href="https://habr.com/ru/company/pvs-studio/">very active in Habr√©</a> .  A significant proportion of the articles are written by technical director <a href="https://habr.com/ru/users/Andrey2008">Andrei Karpov</a> (in the first photo he is at the company's stand). <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/aa/vl/tl/aavltlnjkjxshk2oym8_cvb7mng.jpeg"></a> <br><br>  Another interesting company is <a href="https://bell-sw.com/">BellSoft</a> and their <a href="https://bell-sw.com/java.html">Liberica JDK</a> .  A distinctive feature of this distribution is support for the <i>ARM architecture</i> .  In the first photo - CEO Alexander Belokrylov, who managed to do more and a mini-report on the <i>Demo Stage</i> .  In addition, Dmitry Chuyko spoke further about <i>Java</i> in a container environment. <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/yh/os/bd/yhosbdbsmxydhizqxwkpeoch3re.jpeg"></a> <br><br><h3>  Stand jug.msk.ru </h3><br>  The community of Moscow Java-developers <a href="http://jug.msk.ru/">jug.msk.ru</a> acted as an information partner.  Community meetings <a href="https://habr.com/ru/search/%3Ftarget_type%3Dposts%26q%3D%255Bjug.msk.ru%255D%26order_by%3Ddate">are held regularly</a> , always gathering a large number of participants.  The stand was installed on the ground floor, Andrei Kogun (the leader of <i>jug.msk.ru</i> , part-time participant of the program committee of the conference) was almost always at the stand.  Over the two days of the booth's existence, the number of <a href="https://twitter.com/mskjug">Twitter account</a> subscribers has grown noticeably. <br><br>  <a href="https://habr.com/ru/users/golodnyj">Anton Chernousov</a> ( <a href="https://theartofprogramming.podbean.com/">podcaster</a> , conference organizer, just a good person) and Andrei Kogun (first photo).  Andrei and the conference participants who visited the booth (second photo).  Speakers of past meetings <i>jug.msk.ru</i> : <a href="https://habr.com/ru/company/jugru/blog/339184/">Ivan Ponomarev</a> , <a href="https://habr.com/ru/company/jugru/blog/329728/">Nikita Lipsky</a> and <a href="https://habr.com/ru/company/jugru/blog/332140/">Alexey Stukalov</a> (third photo). <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/zj/jq/zv/zjjqzvpz3oatrsdy3ibddxxttcg.jpeg"></a> <br><br><h3>  Demo stage </h3><br>  Popular place for short reports.  A very attractive form of reports, which also allows you to join some new topics and get information from an area of ‚Äã‚Äãinterest to you when staying outside the main reports.  As already noted, the only drawback is noisy, but these are features of the site. <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/qu/_g/nu/qu_gnuisrhvxohz1wbmbamipc4g.jpeg"></a> <br><br><h3>  Conference opening </h3><br>  Andrei Dmitriev opens the conference, presenting the program committee.  Andrei Kogun and Vladimir Sitnikov talk in detail about the conference program, focusing on possible types of reports. <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/x_/lo/nr/x_lonr7ylfm91kxiw2ir-1jvblu.jpeg"></a> <br><br><h3>  First Day Reports </h3><br>  <b>Anton Keks</b> in his report <b>The world needs full-stack craftsmen</b> advocated the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe greatest possible multi-functionality of each team member.  Using the example of his company, <a href="https://codeborne.com/">Codeborne</a> argued why this is important: the compactness of the team due to the many knowledge and skills of each, reduction of project risks (the notorious truck, under the wheels of which, besides the employee, the product may die due to loss of knowledge), is just interesting to get more knowledge in different areas (it's hard not to agree).  The report inspired not only listeners, but also the speaker - Bruno Borges included in his presentation a slide with Anton's quote: ‚ÄúCraftsman can be 5x‚Äù. <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ft/cm/ji/ftcmjipl225kgr_g-69dxdtkb3s.jpeg"></a> <br><br>  <b>Vladislav Senin</b> with the <b>Logi</b> report <b>: the more, the better - but how to live with it?</b>  performed in the cozy fifth hall.  Vlad is an active participant in the Moscow Java-community; this is his debut as a speaker at <i>JUG.ru</i> conferences.  The evolution of using tools for storing logs and searching through them has been shown.  Log sources are <i>Java</i> and <i>Python applications</i> .  For the search is the basis of <a href="https://www.elastic.co/products/elasticsearch">Elasticsearch</a> .  After the report, additional fascinating details were heard (including the detective story of the search for the reason for the disappearance of the character in <i>JSON</i> ), which were not told due to time constraints, so we can expect a more detailed story of Vlad on this topic in the near future. <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ax/ea/jv/axeajvfwci0dhay6wbgewl7ynzo.jpeg"></a> <br><br>  <b>The</b> <b>Victor Rentea's</b> <b>The Proxy fairy and the magic of Spring</b> <b>report</b> was dedicated to the magic of the <i>Proxy</i> design pattern widely used in the <i>Spring Framework</i> .  In the announcement of the report, there was a promise to introduce six methods of intercepting method calls, two ways to use the <i>Decorator</i> pattern with <i>Spring,</i> and a lot more to do during a live coding session.  A very lively performance that inspires you to experiment with <i>Spring</i> and delve into the code of the examples shown (they are <a href="https://github.com/victorrentea/proxy-fairy-performance">here</a> on <i>GitHub</i> ).  If you like <i>Spring</i> , design patterns and live coding - definitely, this is your report, you have to look. <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/yr/vx/la/yrvxlarmfb7xptka9gqrmmysanw.jpeg"></a> <br><br>  Absolutely practical in practice report of <b>Bulletproof Java Enterprise applications for the hard production life</b> from <b>Sebastian Daschner</b> about how important stability and resiliency in enterprise-applications, and how to achieve it.  During the report, I found and opened the <a href="https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-fault-tolerance">Microprofile Fault Tolerance</a> project on <i>GitHub</i> , the use of annotations from which the speaker actively demonstrated (I remember the <i>most @CircuitBreaker</i> ).  The only drawback of the presentation of the report is the heavily readable headlines (the first photo gives an idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthis, you can click on the picture to enlarge it). <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/bu/y7/io/buy7ioxesaa-0w8am4uuoxwm1b8.jpeg"></a> <br><br>  <b>Spring Boot's</b> Report <b>Us, and we are getting stronger: the intolerable ease of AOT compiling Spring-applications</b> from <b>Nikita Lipsky</b> was a kind of answer to the question about supporting <i>Spring Boot</i> in <i>GraalVM</i> , which was given to Oleg Shelayev the <a href="https://habr.com/ru/company/jugru/blog/446106/">previous day at a meeting</a> (in <i>GraalVM,</i> problems with support as <i>Spring Boot</i> , and the Windows operating system, which Oleg said).  The product <i>Excelsior JET</i> , which is Nikita, with support for different operating systems, everything is fine.  In addition, support for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ahead-of-time_compilation">AOT compilation of</a> <i>Spring Boot</i> was officially announced recently, as was the report.  Additional interest in static AOT compilation of Java applications is now due to the fact that quick start is particularly important for applications (microservices).  Most often applications are based on <i>Spring Boot</i> .  An interesting report, skillfully balancing on the verge of hardcore and easy to understand presentation. <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/bv/cu/kf/bvcukfboo3lrhzwou74_4gu9wuu.jpeg"></a> <br><br>  The joint reports of <b>Kirill Tolkachev</b> and <b>Yevgeny Borisov are</b> traditionally very popular with listeners, <b>Reactive or not reactive, that is the question was</b> no exception - in the first photo you can see the full hall.  The idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe report was to show the usual implementation of a task (the interaction of the three systems in this case), then to remake it in a reactive style.  Inspired by watching Oleg Dokuk's report on the <i>RSocket</i> protocol on the same day, the speakers even managed to refine the <a href="https://github.com/lavcraft/spring-react-or-not-react-jpoint2019">examples</a> .  Everything turned out quite successfully and fascinatingly. <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/mz/fb/bf/mzfbbfjkr_1znjsnwnzagvrdfb4.jpeg"></a> <br><br><h3>  BOF sessions </h3><br>  The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birds_of_a_feather_(computing)">BOF</a> format <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birds_of_a_feather_(computing)">has</a> already been tested several times in recent conferences and has become popular.  Listening to the reports is already hard, but the strength and desire for informal communication is still there - the natural end of the first day.  Below is a photo from the <b>Microservices, cloud</b> BOF session <b>and where it all goes</b> , which took place in the discussion area. <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/xb/4f/ol/xb4folgt2h_qmqvbw2kn5wxdpj0.jpeg"></a> <br><br><h3>  Second day reports </h3><br>  A distinctive feature, the "highlight" of technical conferences <i>JUG.ru</i> is the presence in the program of one non-technical report.  This time such a talk was the <b>Game of God.</b>  <b>Has science</b> <b>crossed the</b> <b>border</b> from <b>Alexander Panchin</b> .  Such reports expand the horizons, allow you to tune in for the day (this time the report was opening the second day).  Finally, they are mutually interesting both to the speaker (non-standard audience) and to listeners (unusual subject area).  Naturally, the report was popular science, but very interesting.  Changes in the genetic code and correction of genetic defects, successes and modern approaches in the fight against HIV and cancer.  Enumeration of personalities of scientists dealing with similar problems and their achievements. <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/v8/sc/ge/v8scgeatu8dqhkmx4sp3ecwiih8.jpeg"></a> <br><br>  Lightweight (in a good sense of the word - easy for perception and understanding) report <b>Local variable type inference: Friend or foe?</b>  was presented by <b>Simon Ritter</b> .  The topic of the report is the <i>inference of the</i> types of local variables when using <i>var</i> (a feature introduced in <i>Java 10</i> ).  On closer examination, it turned out that there is a lot of nuances in such a simple, at first glance question that needs attention.  It is felt that the speaker has extensive conference experience (his work record includes work at <i>Sun Microsystems</i> , <i>Oracle</i> , <i>Azul</i> and the title J <i>ava Rockstar</i> , <i>Java Champion</i> ).  The story is very easy and obeyed, and was well illustrated with slides.  One of the examples of reports with a clear practical focus. <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/jz/bo/8b/jzbo8bgwf1ajzuljjszpmerjszc.jpeg"></a> <br><br>  Speech <b>Supercompilation, partial evaluation, projections of Futamura and how GraalVM will save the world</b> performed by <b>Oleg Shelayev</b> was a continuation of the topic of <i>GraalVM</i> , the story on which he began on April 4 at a <a href="https://habr.com/ru/company/jugru/blog/446106/">meeting jug.msk.ru.</a>  It was very useful to first listen to a detailed introductory three-hour story immediately before the conference, then on the first day to go to the report of Nikita Lipsky (about support <i>Spring Boot</i> with <i>AOT</i> ), and then return to <i>GraalVM again</i> .  The conversation concerned the theoretical foundations of the compiler <i>Graal</i> and <i>GraalVM</i> - <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/47418/">projections of</a> <a href="https://fi.ftmr.info/">Futamura</a> .  The second topic was a demonstration of using <i>Truffle</i> - a framework for creating programming languages ‚Äã‚Äãbased on <i>GraalVM</i> .  Oleg also recommended listening to the report by Thomas Wuerthinger, which was read on the previous day of the conference. <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/qj/gf/jk/qjgfjklx4xlemqgf0wvadtft15y.jpeg"></a> <br><br>  <b>Tagir Valeev</b> presented an interesting concept of atomic changes when performing code refactoring in a report on <b>Atomic refactoring in IntelliJ IDEA: we bend the IDE to ourselves</b> .  The idea of ‚Äã‚Äãatomic changes at each and every small step of modifying the lines of code was shown in the <i>IntelliJ IDEA</i> development environment - Tagir represents <i>JetBrains</i> company, personally participating in its development.  In addition, the overwhelming majority of those sitting in the hall (including me) use <i>IntelliJ IDEA</i> every day, so what was said and shown lay on fertile soil.  Frankly, I never wondered if my very smallest step of change was atomic, but now I will try to pay attention to this, perhaps reviewing the video of the report. <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/jt/ge/dc/jtgedcak5ozlxwcrpb9iqb5wh2o.jpeg"></a> <br><br>  Another example of the report, the information after listening to which can be applied in practice, - <b>Java slows down: CodeCache edition</b> from <b>Vladimir Sitnikov</b> .  It talked about <i>CodeCache</i> - the area in which the <i>JVM</i> stores bytecode compiled into <i>native</i> code ( <i>native</i> , executable code of the target platform).  The case, which was discussed in the report, occurred when using the <i>WebLogic Server</i> , but the specific type of application server does not really matter.  An interesting sequence of steps that should be performed with errors of this type, and knowledge of the default values ‚Äã‚Äãfor the size of <i>CodeCache</i> in different versions of <i>Java</i> (or at least the fact that they are different, and you may need to manually specify a larger size). <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/yz/ww/tu/yzwwtuh2iuwrexkcrpcdz8doreo.jpeg"></a> <br><br>  To some extent, <b>How to unravel a tangle of threads: analysis and debugging of applications in IntelliJ IDEA</b> , the report of <b>Anton Arkhipov</b> , echoed the first part of his three-hour <a href="https://habr.com/ru/company/jugru/blog/428648/">speech</a> in November last year.  The information that was received on the aforementioned speech and on this particular report turned out to be useful.  The code research techniques were shown using the example of <a href="https://github.com/spring-io/initializr">Spring Initializr</a> .  Many people know about structural search in <i>IntelliJ IDEA</i> , but they use it.  Perhaps the demonstration of this possibility by Anton will push someone to its daily use. <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/wd/aq/rz/wdaqrzprix7xvcw7g2a6cziqgze.jpeg"></a> <br><br>  <b>Bruno Borges, the</b> final conference report, <b>Making, out of serverless computing,</b> began with reports that, despite his work at <i>Microsoft</i> , he never used the Windows operating system (the presentation was run from a <i>MacBook</i> ), having a wealth of Java development experience and having worked previously in <i>Oracle</i> company.  He is now a <i>developer advocate</i> at <i>Microsoft</i> , is promoting the use of clouds.  The key features of ‚Äúserverless‚Äù use were discussed in detail: <i>event-driven</i> handling ( <i>micro-billing</i> ), <i>micro-billing</i> flexibility, no need for self-installation of anything and <i>no server setup or maintenance,</i> and <i>self-scaling</i> infrastructure.  A peculiar link with the beginning of the conference was, as already noted, the use of quotes from the presentation of Anton Keks. <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/sl/p0/or/slp0orpqyn0wzrtsbxquutwehfu.jpeg"></a> <br><br><h3>  Closing </h3><br>  The final word of Andrei Dmitriev with a request to respond to the letter with feedback.  Traditional photos of the program committee members, the <i>JUG.ru</i> team and speakers. <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/vl/yp/xv/vlypxvyn26dxzs4luibwap7ialq.jpeg"></a> <br><br><h3>  Results </h3><br>  The conference quite unexpectedly grew in the number of participants.  Having moved some time ago from the Radisson Slavyanskaya Hotel to the Congress Center of the World Trade Center, now it feels constrained at the current venue.  Probably, while maintaining the trend of growth of interest, we can expect in the near future to replace the site with an even more spacious one. <br><br>  The thoughts expressed by Baruch Sadogursky in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Ftime_continue%3D1%26v%3DKoXfrI7bpzY">an interview with Yegor Bugaenko on Joker 2018</a> about the lack of the fair sex in <i>IT</i> were heard - there were more girls at the conference than at previous ones. <br><br>  Minor organizational and technical overlays were rather connected with a large number of participants, and even then they were promptly corrected.  Video presentations for conference participants are already available on <i>YouTube</i> , as well as presentation files on <a href="https://jpoint.ru/">the conference website are</a> publicly available. <br><br><blockquote>  <b>On October 25-26, 2019, a</b> conference for Java developers <a href="https://jokerconf.com/">Joker 2019</a> will take place <b>in St. Petersburg</b> , <a href="https://jokerconf.com/cfp/">applications for reports are</a> open and <a href="https://jokerconf.com/registration/">tickets</a> can already be <a href="https://jokerconf.com/registration/">purchased</a> (at the lowest price until May 1). </blockquote></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/447126/">https://habr.com/ru/post/447126/</a></p>
