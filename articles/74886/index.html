  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Sleep war</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  In continuation of my topic of <a href="http://dimoning.habrahabr.ru/blog/74612/">lack of sleep and ‚Äúlate in bed‚Äù I</a> want to write about the results and results. <br><br>  I will not write anything new, everyone knows everything, but after the experience I would like to warn everyone.  So.  The problem was that I could not sleep until 4 am (see previous topic), and then I could not wake up at 8 to work. <br><br>  Yesterday I made a fatal mistake.  I decided that if I could not fall asleep before 5 am, then I could not go to bed.  What did it lead me to? <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  By 7.30 I arrived at work, worked until 10, slept until 12 and went home about one o'clock in the afternoon.  The worst thing is not even that I left early, but how I felt at the same time.  In the hope that I will be able to wake up from the power engineers - I also actively used these energies (half liter, to be more precise).  Plus at work I drank about 2-3 cups of instant coffee.

      I did not wake up, I wanted to sleep even more.  But unpleasantly stabbed on the left side of the chest (heart?).  Plus, I lost any performance in principle. <br><br>  My condition would be easiest to describe something like this: I want to sleep so much that it is impossible to go home to sleep.  Impossible is the best word.  I really imagined with horror how I would be in the transport for an hour, when I didn‚Äôt understand anything.  I do not want (on the verge of "can not") to do anything, even move.  The reaction is inhibited, like a tortoise, legs barely move.  And I‚Äôm generally silent about programming - the head has turned off completely.  Well, a slightly altered state of consciousness - loss of reference point in time, inhibition of reaction, you can look at one point for 5 minutes and only then realize that I looked at one point for 5 minutes. Of course, I did not use anything - I just decided not to sleep at night. <br><br>  Maybe this is my personal response to lack of sleep.  But I understood and became convinced that the most important thing (at least for me) is to get enough sleep.  Everything else depends on it, absolutely everything (and successes, and failures and mood, and results, and even relationships with other people). <br><br>  In general, my war with a dream has been going on for a long time (year 2), and during this time I have made trite conclusions, in general, but I would like to summarize.  Moreover, it is one thing to think, and another thing to learn from your own experience. <br><br>  First you need to remember.  <b>Sleep is not some kind of convention.</b>  <b>This is a rest.</b>  If you do not relax, you can soon find yourself in a coffin or get problems of smaller sizes (the most fun - the heart).  Does the word rest seem nonsense too?  Then imagine that someone was forced to run for 3 days in a row without a break.  He just had no rest.  What will happen to him?  Yep  Or an automatic - let him shoot 5 hours in a row.  Overheating - this is putting it mildly, right?  And why then do we sometimes treat our own rest with such neglect? <br><br>  The most important thing is to get enough sleep, if there is no desire to end an active life by 30 or life by 40 in principle.  Many in the past topic, unsubscribed that "for youth" they worked like moose, did not sleep, worked.  And then, closer to 30-40 years (someone like), it turned out that he couldn‚Äôt work in principle for more than a few hours a day, the rest of the time - he is sluggish in doing something.  That is a chronic, apparently, condition. <br><br>  <b>That in any case can not be done if the time is already 5 am, and you have not yet gone to bed:</b> <br><br>  1) Do not sleep at all.  Detailed description see above.  It is better to sleep 2 hours than not to sleep. <br><br>  2) Drink lots of coffee or (even worse) "energy drinks."  I can say - it really does not work either that or that.  I believe that 90% of the effect of coffee is a placebo.  It is proved very simply: how can coffee replace sleep?  No  But with the help of coffee and energy drinks, you can drive yourself.  Plus, there may be heart problems with long-term and constant use (or using a large amount at a time). <br><br>  3) Continue to torment yourself with lack of sleep, if you want to sleep. <br><br>  <b>What to do to get enough sleep?</b> <br><br>  I brought for myself a simple method of calculating the time needed to rest.  On Saturday we go to bed at any time and wake up not according to the alarm clock.  For example, they went to 12, woke up at 10 am.  So for a complete rest (when the body itself wakes up) we need 10 hours.  So, to wake up at 7 am to work, you need to go to bed at 9 pm. <br><br>  I agree, an unpleasant situation (it turns out that you come home and immediately go to bed).  But what is more important - to play WoW at bedtime and get health problems in a month or go to bed on time? <br><br>  1) If you do not fall asleep.  Take valerian or motherwort tincture (or any other tincture, as long as it was on the grass - harmless).  Lie down and "spin" until you fall asleep. <br><br>  2) In no case do not leave working television or a computer with a film ("fall asleep under the TV").  The fact is that it is more difficult to fall asleep, restless sleep, there is a chance to wake up from a shootout in a film, etc.  You get much sleep worse than if you slept in silence. <br><br>  3) Do not drink any tonic at night.  Concerning alcohol: from beer, for example, it pulls harder.  But from all sorts of ‚Äúcans‚Äù, like RedDevil, on the contrary - I want to sleep, but do not fall asleep. <br><br>  4) For those who suffer from the same disease as me - ‚ÄúI could have done something useful, but instead I sleep!‚Äù, Accept it.  To accept and understand a simple thing - nothing useful can be done if there is a lack of sleep. <br><br>  Another good observation for me was the following.  Look at the animals.  Wanted to sleep - lay down and sleep.  Everything!  We do not tolerate for 2 days to go to the toilet?  Or eat?  Why then do we think that we can sleep less, if we fulfill all other biological needs in full? <br><br>  I will be glad to your comments.  Thank. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/74886/">https://habr.com/ru/post/74886/</a></p>
