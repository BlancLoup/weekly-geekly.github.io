  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Four years progress</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  So it happened in my life that at the next turn of my career I am now doing almost exactly the same thing I did four years ago.  Yesterday, for a moment, being distracted from the everyday work rush, I suddenly realized how much better everything had become during these four years. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  All around are talking on cell phones, not too worried about the minutes spent.  Half of the people around each have two mobile phones - personal and corporate.  Yes, and mobile phones themselves are not the same a few years ago.  Four years ago, if you remember, there were no people with pagers, but they also threw the phone in the 5th second and chose the appropriate tariff carefully and with a calculator in hand. <br>  Today I have bold and unlimited Internet access everywhere, at home, at work. <br>  Computers have become much more powerful.  Four years ago, a 2GHz Pentium with 1GB of RAM was considered a very good computer, and at that time there were no dual core processors.  Now I have a laptop in all respects noticeably more powerful than the then-existing workstation. <br>  Four years ago there were almost no LCD monitors, especially large ones, especially two pieces per workplace. <br>  Windows and Linux have become noticeably more stable and convenient.  Oracle and MS SQL are also noticeably more stable. <br>  If earlier work with vmware was a necessary flour, now it hardly reduces its own performance, primarily due to dual-core processors and a much larger amount of RAM.  Yes, and the possibility of a couple of minutes with one click to create snapshot or roll back to the previous one, four years ago, you could only dream of. <br>  Development environments and all kinds of tools have become much more convenient.  In Java, generics appeared, and almost everyone already believed that it was only a matter of time before GWT completely supplanted JSP. <br>  The Documentum platform, with which most of my work is connected, has changed for the better in four years in all respects, and it has changed a lot.  And four years ago, instead of merging into synergetic ecstasy, as the vendor of the platform and the solution developer under this platform, we more often spoiled each other‚Äôs nerves, then technical support works as a well-established mechanism (honor and praise to all who made it). <br>  Outside of work directly related, too, a lot of things improved - I wasn't going to write about it.  However, I can not ignore the fact that by car I now travel with a sitigide, and my health insurance (four years ago this was not) makes communication with medical organizations no more difficult than going to the store. <br>  How do you think, in how many years will we say ‚Äúthis was at a time when most of the programs were desktop?‚Äù <br>  Ps.  Very recently the topic <a href="http://www.overstream.net/view.php%3Foid%3Dm1eju3tya6n4">ran a movie</a> . </div>
