  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The social platform revolution ‚Äì4. Another profession SaaS</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  <em>This note with some delay continues our conversation about the <a href="http://www.itechbridge.com/forum/index.php%3Fshowtopic%3D65574">new stage of the development of social networks</a> , what kind of revolution and why I call it revolutionary.</em>  <em>Despite the fact that it is numbered as the fourth, in fact, this is the fifth note of this cycle (in the interval, ‚Äú <a href="http://www.itechbridge.com/forum/index.php%3Fshowtopic%3D72401">From the madness of the crowd ...</a> ‚Äù was published - a note located at the junction of several topics).</em> <br><br>  In this post I want to talk about <strong>transparent social platforms</strong> .  Let me remind you * that transparent (white label) platforms are platforms focused on creating social spaces (resources) that do not carry any information or carry minimal information about the platforms themselves, which gave rise to these resources. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The Russian equivalent of the term white label in the context of platforms proposed by me.  If you like it more, you can use ‚Äútraceless‚Äù, ‚Äúinvisible‚Äù, ‚Äúhidden‚Äù, ‚Äúself-lightening‚Äù platform or something else instead of ‚Äútransparent platform‚Äù.  This is not the case; only the essence would be clear. <br>  <strong>About transparent SaaS - platforms</strong> <br>  Further, we will discuss here only the most characteristic subset of transparent platforms belonging to the class of multi-purpose operating platforms *.  The named platform class combines the instrumental functions (development environment) and functions of the working environment (run-time environment).  In this case, the instrumental service is provided to the customer only in the ‚Äúon demand‚Äù mode.  In other words, we will talk about transparent social SaaS - platforms *, bearing in mind, above all, the instrumental component of their services. <br><br>  In the time interval after the publication of the first article on the cycle of social platforms, in Techncrunch I came across a rather <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2007/07/24/9-ways-to-build-your-own-social-network">thorough review article</a> on the class of transparent platforms that we are interested in.

      <strong>Nine ways to build your own social network</strong> <br>  That is, according to the number of considered platforms, the indicated article is named.  About 200 readers commented on the article, so I think that after reading all this, everyone who is interested in the problem will understand well the features of transparent SaaS platforms.  However, for those who prefer to read in Russian in my <a href="http://www.itechbridge.com/forum/index.php%3Fshowtopic%3D85908">blog</a> at iTech Bridge, I cite an abstract of this article with some of its generalizations and notes.  In addition, I included Pringo, another fairly advanced platform, which the author for some reason did not include in his nine. <br><br>  Many of the statements of the author of the article being reviewed were verified by me.  In this case, the abstract contains direct links to the relevant resources.  First of all, it concerns Ning - one of the leaders of the world of transparent social SaaS - platforms, almost the direct Russian equivalent of which is ucoz.ru.  Information without direct links left on the conscience of the author. <br><br>  <strong>Transparent platforms open too</strong> <br>  I would also like to add on my own that, besides internal or own openness at the level of programmer interfaces and user information inherent in many platforms discussed in the article, the general trends of the social web put forward the task of external openness in relation to other social resources. <br><br>  The first in this direction began the Ning movement.  I have already <a href="http://www.itechbridge.com/forum/index.php%3Fshowtopic%3D65574">mentioned</a> that the company that owns these resources has joined the ‚Äúclosed partner club‚Äù Open Social. <br><br>  Even today, Ning as an external container (in Open Social terminology) allows each application (apps) compatible with Open Social to connect to any resource created on the basis of the Ning platform.  After that, any user of the resource to which some such application is connected can become a user of this application. <br><br>  Even earlier, Ning included an instrumental service as part of its platform, using which any customer can easily build an application to FaceBook and connect it to the latter.  True, this application will have quite limited capabilities, but literally, in a few minutes, a person who is completely unfamiliar with programming can create it. <br><br>  Ning is currently <a href="http://blog.pmarca.com/2007/10/open-social-a-n.html">working</a> on a similar mechanism, but for Open Social.  At a minimum, it can be expected that any target Ning resource will be easily connected as an attachment to Orkut, and then to other containers from members of the ‚Äúclosed club‚Äù.  At the same time, which is very important, the hosting of such an application is also fully supported by Ning servers. <br><br>  There is no doubt that other transparent social SaaS platforms will move along the way of Ning today.  The interesting thing then appears, as the hero of one of the last TV shows loved to repeat, an oil painting.  But I plan to talk about this in my next article. <br><br>  <em>Well, in the meantime, once again I remind you that you can get acquainted with the abstract in Russian of the above article <a href="http://www.itechbridge.com/forum/index.php%3Fshowtopic%3D85908">here</a> .</em> <em><br><br></em>  <em>- * Classification of social platforms is given in my other <a href="http://www.itechbridge.com/forum/index.php%3Fshowtopic%3D69258">article in</a> this series.</em> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/21984/">https://habr.com/ru/post/21984/</a></p>
