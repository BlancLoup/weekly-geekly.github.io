      Under the cut there are some historical examples of wiretapping and available ways to self-check their premises. <br>  <i>(If your distant acquaintances are confronted with the detection and, God forbid, with the installation of bugs, share in the comments)</i> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><blockquote>  Part 3 of Art.  138 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation provides for criminal liability for the illegal production, sale or purchase of special technical equipment intended for secretly obtaining information. <br><br>  Such special technical means include, for example, devices for secretly obtaining acoustic information, visual observation, and listening to telephone conversations.  The free circulation of such special devices is prohibited by federal law; only law enforcement officers and special services are allowed to use them during operational investigative activities.  Development, production, sale and purchase of special technical equipment can be carried out exclusively on the basis of a license issued by the Federal Security Service of Russia. </blockquote><br><br><h4>  How to listen </h4><br><br>  <b>Legend</b> <br>  This legendary story began at the end of 1943, when Stalin was informed about the creation in the USSR of a unique listening device - a microwave resonator designed by Lev Theremen. <br><br>  The Perpetual Mover did not need batteries and operated in a completely passive mode ‚Äî neither magnetic fields, nor its own power sources ‚Äî anything that could unmask the device.  Placed inside an object, the ‚Äútadpole‚Äù was driven by microwave radiation from a remote source - the microwave wave generator itself could be located anywhere within a radius of hundreds of meters.  Under the influence of the human voice, the nature of the oscillations of the resonating antenna was changed - it remained only to receive the signal reflected by the ‚Äúbug‚Äù, record it on a magnetic tape and decipher it, restoring the original speech. <br><br>  The spy system, code-named "Chrysostom," consisted of three elements: a pulse generator, a resonator ("bug") and a receiver of reflected signals, placed in the form of an isosceles triangle.  The generator and receiver could be located outside the object being listened to, but the main problem was the installation of a ‚Äúbug‚Äù in the office of the American ambassador. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/2aa/8c9/d8d/2aa8c9d8d64e45fd914746b06bc4ae0a.jpg"><br><br>  Focus with fire failed.  As practice has shown, the security of the Americans was all good.  Access to the secret premises of the Embassy was strictly limited.  None of the Soviet citizens and members of official delegations were allowed close to the upper floors of the building. <br><br>  It was then that the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe "Trojan horse" was born. <br><br>  The solemn ruler in the Artek camp, tied red ties and a line of young voiced voices singing the English anthem of the United States - the American ambassador broke through a tear.  Touched by the warm welcome, Harriman handed the pioneer organization a check for 10 thousand dollars.  Present on the lineup, the British ambassador also gave the pioneers a check for 5,000 pounds sterling.  At the same moment, to the solemn sounds of music, the four pioneers introduced a varnished wooden shield with the USA coat of arms carved on it. <br><br>  On the upper floors of the houses on the opposite side of the street, in front of the American Embassy, ‚Äã‚Äãtwo safe houses of the NKVD appeared - they installed a generator and a receiver of reflected signals.  The espionage system worked like a clock: the Yankees spoke, the Soviet intelligence officers recorded.  In the mornings, wet linen was hung on the balconies of the apartments, the ‚Äúhousewives‚Äù from the NKVD diligently shook out the rugs, literally blowing dust into the eyes of the American counterintelligence. <br><br>  For seven years, the Russian bug "undermined" worked in the interests of Russian intelligence.  During this time, Zlatoust experienced four ambassadors - every time the new inhabitants of the office sought to change all the furniture and interiors, only the wonderful coat of arms remained invariably in the same place. <br><br>  The existence of the "bug" in the Embassy of the Yankees learned only in 1952 - according to the official version, radio engineers accidentally discovered on the air the frequency on which Zlatoust worked.  An urgent inspection of the Embassy‚Äôs premises was carried out, the entire office of the head of the embassy ‚Äúwas shaken upside down‚Äù - and found. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c10/3d8/f18/c103d8f18ab84fc8bd714c041a21b603.jpg"><br><br>  The British scientist Peter Wright helped Americans understand Zlatoust's work principles - familiarity with the microwave resonator Theremin was shocked by the Western intelligence services, experts themselves admitted that if not for the case, the ‚Äúeternal bug‚Äù could still ‚Äúundermine‚Äù the symbol of American statehood at the Embassy USA Moscow. <br>  [ <a href="http://topwar.ru/33369-zlatoust-v-amerikanskom-posolstve-shedevry-russkogo-shpionazha.html">source</a> ] <br><br>  <b>Battery cell phone</b> (fake, but still interesting) <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/966/adf/436/966adf43661a4448bf9afcbde9b1f135.jpg"><br><blockquote>  An unexpected find in the mobile phone that can expect each of us. <br>  In general, - Samsung c4.

The power of the internal amplifier is 2 W, the external one is up to 1 kW (for comparison, the power of a standard Wi-Fi card is 0.2 W).  In 2008, the CTX4000 was supposed to be replaced by a more advanced version of PHOTOANGLO with the range expanded to 4 GHz and the size of a ‚Äúsmall portfolio‚Äù. <br><br>  When turned on, the radar creates around itself (or in front of itself, depending on the type of the radiator antenna) a high-power electromagnetic field at the selected frequency.  The informative signal from the radio bookmark modulates this field, and the receiving antenna of the radio complex reads the modulated signal and uses the filter to extract the informative signal from it (HF imposition).  The radar in this scheme as it organizes the communication channel between the bookmark and the receiving antenna.  Similarly, for example, passive Recco avalanche sensors, or RFID cards, work. <br>  The use of a powerful external carrier signal has several advantages: <br>  antenna size and power of the bookmark emitter can be minimized; <br>  a passive tab will consume significantly less energy (hence the size of the battery pack can also be reduced); <br>  Passive bookmark is activated only when it is irradiated with a signal of a certain frequency, therefore, it is much more difficult to identify it than a conventional radio bookmark. <br><br>  LOUDAUTO bug <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/773/b7d/938/773b7d938e4fb73dafca497ced9b9e29.png" alt="image"><br>  Size: about 1.5 centimeters long without batteries <br>  Price: $ 30 <br><br>  Sensitive microphone allows you to eavesdrop on the "office" conversation from a distance of more than 6 meters.

The operating frequency range of such an indicator is determined by the bandwidth of the wideband amplifier, and the IP bandwidth is usually several gigahertz.  Since in most PIs there are no input signal selection circuits, they are not capable of scanning the frequency range and react to the appearance of electromagnetic signals above the threshold value almost instantly, <br>  regardless of the transmission frequency. <br><br>  Recently, selective IPs have appeared on the market, operating on the principle of a scanning receiver, but with a wider bandwidth. <br>  review.  Due to the wide bandwidth, the sensitivity of the power source does not exceed 10 mV, and therefore the detection range of electromagnetic radiation exceeding the threshold value is low and in practice amounts to several meters (‚Äúnear zone‚Äù), and also strongly depends on the operating frequency and power of the radiation source .  Thus, the PI registers electromagnetic emissions exceeding the threshold values ‚Äã‚Äãat the monitoring site and, in accordance with the criteria laid down in the control circuit of the device, displays the data about the detected signals to the display device. <br><br>  <b>Electromagnetic environment of</b> almost any room is characterized by many components.  It includes, above all, <br>  radiation of legal sources, which include VHF radio stations, cellular and trunking communication systems, television, radio telephones, working household electronics, etc. The combination of these radiations constitutes the electromagnetic background of a room, which determines the threshold value for most field indicators .  The background values ‚Äã‚Äãof electromagnetic radiation will be approximately the same for the rooms adjacent to the test area. <br><br>  When an active storage unit (stowing device) is inserted into the room, in most cases its radiation will differ sharply from the background in power, amplitude and significantly exceed the threshold value.  When the threshold level is set correctly, the IP will begin to pick up the radiation of the charger and output the signal parameters to the display device, according to which the operator will be able to decide whether the detected radiation source belongs to the charger.  Consequently, the information displayed on the display device plays an important role in determining the belonging of the detected radiation to the work of the charger. <br>  [ <a href="http://alt-1c.ru/userfiles/again_on_the_indicators_of_the_electromagnetic_field_information_security.pdf">source</a> ] <br></div></div><br><br>  <b>First, a few words about bugs simulators, then about field indicators</b> <br><br><h4>  TEST control device </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a31/4ee/3b3/a314ee3b3114437ca68565941a733537.jpg"><br>  Its use allows to evaluate the performance of the following modes: <br><ul><li>  high frequency detector frequency meter; </li><li>  wireline analyzer (NPS); </li><li>  detector of low-frequency magnetic fields; </li><li>  infrared detector. </li></ul><br><br>  TEST is a set of simulators assembled in one case with autonomous power. <br>  The simulator for evaluating the performance of a high-frequency detector-frequency meter is a mini radio transmitter with quartz frequency stabilization and the ability to turn off the modulating signal, for a wire line analyzer - a signal generator with a given frequency, for a detector of low-frequency magnetic fields - a source of stable magnetic field and for an infrared detector - IR transmitter -band with a given subcarrier frequency. <br><br>  TEST allows you to evaluate the sensitivity of the test path, the accuracy of related measurements (frequency meter, NPS synthesizer), the operability of detectors, an oscilloscope, a spectrum analyzer and the display of measurement results. <br><br>  Specifications: <br><ul><li>  Mini radio transmitter frequency, MHz - 270 ¬± 0.01 </li><li>  The frequency of the simulator submarine, MHz - 8.445 </li><li>  IR transmitter wavelength, nm, - within 770-1100 </li><li>  IR transmitter subcarrier frequency, kHz - 100 </li><li>  Frequency of the modulating signal, kHz - 1 </li><li>  Type of modulating signal - AIM </li><li>  Supply voltage, V - 3 (2 AA batteries) </li><li>  Current consumption, mA, - no more than 45 </li><li>  Dimensions, mm - 88X56X18 </li></ul><br><br>  This thing is designed to test expensive professional field indicators, such as <a href="http://www.detsys.ru/catalog/ustrojstva-zashhity-peregovorov/sredstva-obnoruzhenya-kanalov-utechki-informacii/st_033/">"Piranha"</a> <br><br>  <b>TTM-700</b> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/3c6/bee/f63/3c6beef63b9d4ac798cff5270015c11d.jpg"><br>  About this thing I did not find anything in the network, but the harsh inscription on the case evokes respect. <br><br>  <b>Antijugs</b> <br>  I conducted a superficial testing of the field indicators and share the results and impressions. <br><br>  <b>Bughunter</b> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ed0/0ce/a67/ed00cea6765f4cd09f932ae0979d5022.jpg"><br>  Chips - price (about 10 thousand rubles) <br>  Primitive interface (where you really can only choose the sensitivity of the device), work only in real time (which does not allow to detect delayed transmissions).
