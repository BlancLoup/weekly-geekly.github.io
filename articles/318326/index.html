      In the comments on the material on <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/cbs/blog/304302/">ISE + FirePOWER</a> a controversy broke out on the subject of decryption.  I decided to look into this fascinating subject in more detail. <br><br>  All the NGFW, UTM and Web proxy solutions I know to decrypt https use certificate spoofing.  I will operate on the example of Cisco virtual FirePOWER Thread Defense (hereinafter referred to as vFTD) managed by Cisco FirePOWER Management Center virtual (hereinafter referred to as FMC). <br><br>  My colleague once described this solution in detail <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/cbs/blog/304794/">here</a> .  The principles mentioned apply to most such solutions. <br><br>  <b>Is decryption necessary or not?</b> <br><br>  <i>Filtering by URL categories, site reputations, and Internet applications is the classic NGFW functionality.</i> <br><br>  To understand which site a client accesses it is not necessary to decrypt all traffic.  The decoding functionality, as such, is only needed for certain actions: traffic analysis, file transfer control, and monitoring.  In the case of filtering Internet access by https, decryption is not needed, even if it is not obvious. <br><br>  <b>This is how URL category blocking works:</b> <br><br>  Create an access policy on the FMC, which will block access to social.  networks. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/4af/895/140/4af895140251478ab0309af2db6f086b.png"><br><br>  We try access in the usual http.  From soc.  We will use the old <a href="http://www.hi5.com/">www.hi5.com</a> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/800/e69/c47/800e69c4775c44f9adcc77a61c1c4c3a.png"><br><br>  Access Denied, the policy works.  We look at the FMC in Analysis -&gt; Connections -&gt; Events.  Here are our blocked requests: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/803/b05/295/803b05295c9946b290944ee880d5c6a6.png"><br><br>  Shift the table to the right to view the URL: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/544/248/a98/544248a98a9e47e58fa7ce76c8df0ffa.png"><br><br>  We look in Wireshark with a filter by IP-address 67.221.174.31: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/740/e31/1be/740e311be4164147bf6fec2861c081bf.png"><br><br>  We see: TCP handshake passes, then the client sends an HTTP Get with the URI "http://hi5.com".  On HTTP Get, he immediately gets a 403 Forbidden response.  Here is the content: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e59/bbe/27a/e59bbe27a7a94fa0bcb480e85b1fb21a.png"><br><br>  It can be seen that this is the very End User Notification (hereinafter EUN), which we see in the browser.  EUN sends vFTD in response to an attempt to go to a prohibited resource.  Moreover, EUN is sent from IP-address 67.221.174.31.  That is, in fact, vFTD is wedged into the TCP session between the client and the server and puts its response. <br><br>  Ok, with clear http everything is clear.  Now we try to go to https-site, for example, vk.com.  VFTD decryption is not enabled.  Can we block? <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/bf3/ce6/d8c/bf3ce6d8c8b34ee198b75ebe3c8f184c.png"><br><br>  Oh, again Access Denied.  on FMC in Analysis -&gt; Connections -&gt; Events.  Here are our blocked requests: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/683/fc3/1db/683fc31db98c4d0196262d2e2124db6b.png"><br><br>  Move right: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/3c0/4db/704/3c04db7046234e6abac3992ba5641ccc.png"><br><br>  We see that vk.com was not a good example.  It turns out that initially the session is established via http (tcp port 80, seen in the second column of the last page).  Therefore, blocking occurs in the same scenario as in the first case. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Redirect http to https</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  Of course, for vk.com we could just write in the browser "https://vk.com".  Then we immediately get to the secure version of the site.  But usually no one does this - the site redirects to https itself. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/552/cba/4ce/552cba4ceeec4e7db4735cf0e13b879b.png"><br>  <i>Redirection</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/1a2/92e/ad0/1a292ead0d3f49c9a396e95a468ca855.png"><br>  <i>Wireshark for contact 1</i> <br><br>  We see that the client first sets up a tcp session on port 80. In response to HTTP Get, the server responds with HTTP 302 Found. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d06/ec0/e84/d06ec0e8422643f5ba1f3eb099998fee.png"><br>  <i>HTTP get</i> <br><br>  Wikipedia suggests that the HTTP 302 code means: "The requested document is temporarily available at a different URI specified in the header in the Location field."  We see that the location indicated <a href="https://vk.com/">vk.com</a> .  Therefore, the client immediately sets up a new tcp session, but on port 443. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/375/f07/89f/375f0789f33147a0bedba9c83a5d7012.png"><br>  <i>Wireshark for contact 2</i> <br></div></div><br>  If you have not yet fallen asleep - try facebook.com: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/da3/227/178/da3227178ecc454baa85e165c76e36d4.png"><br><br>  Access is blocked, but EUN is not displayed.  Let's look at FMC: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/3d0/e42/868/3d0e428685554a2b8196888a001d1d84.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/9e3/4b3/a3e/9e34b3a3e5454d70ad8f127e7f0e4f77.png"><br><br>  Let's look at Wireshark: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/690/0a3/955/6900a3955793496785a0316cc8c3d39c.png"><br><br>  We see that, unlike vk, facebook immediately establishes a session on port 443. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">hsts</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  Facebook uses the hsts mechanism.  In short: sites that support hsts, after establishing a connection with the client via https, tell the browser to always use https for subsequent connections.  That is, for all subsequent sessions they locally substitute https: // instead of http: // into the address bar. <br><br>  For example, in google chrome, you can see for which sites hsts is enabled.  To do this, enter chrome: // net-internals / # hsts in the address bar: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/5e3/cf9/c52/5e3cf9c5229c4583b29dcc413388f7cd.png"><br>  <i>Check hsts in Chrome</i> <br></div></div><br>  By a traffic dump in Wireshark, we see that vFTD blocks the session to facebook after each SSL Client hello message.  Accordingly, Client hello contains enough information to recognize the URL and make a decision about blocking.  Consider Client hello more closely: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/4e8/10d/e92/4e810de92a05487cb22d59e8b6c6b52d.png"><br><br>  Indeed, the Server Name Indication extension field contains information on which the requested resource can be identified. <br><br>  As for EUN, FirePOWER has some limitations when displaying blocking notifications to users.  For un-decrypted traffic, EUN will not be displayed. <br><br>  This is logical, because FirePOWER encloses the EUN page in the established session (if it is not decrypted, it cannot be done). <br><br>  <b>Internet application blocking:</b> <br><br>  Maybe you should pour yourself some coffee again.  It remains a bit, but better to be safe. <br>  The last thing I decided to check is whether filtering of Internet applications inside https will work.  In particular, componentwise. <br><br>  Create a policy that will block Google Drive, Google Maps and Google Play: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f45/f70/919/f45f70919d7b4fd080f2f18df48c8b75.png"><br><br>  Check - selected applications successfully blocked.  We look at FMC: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/257/823/30e/25782330e8c7441e9f10cf7d099f1eea.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d9c/575/ffc/d9c575ffc7b647d6953c3bb14214f0cf.png"><br><br>  In Wireshark, you can see that applications are blocked by the same scenario as Facebook, that is, after each SSL Client Hello: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/809/101/9a6/8091019a6b544aa9b5924e30d20285f5.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f0e/0a8/22d/f0e0a822d4874843b8093caa1ae01086.png"><br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Internet application blocking</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  In practice, you need to check the possibility of blocking for specific applications.  There is no guarantee that the configured policy will work regardless of decryption (it is on or off).  Application versions are constantly changing, and patches for FirePOWER may not keep pace with them. <br><br>  Some applications still require decryption to be recognized.  There are not many of them, they are marked in the policy settings with a special lock icon. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b07/9ca/bb4/b079cabb48024bd4a0d29016d39c74b7.png"><br>  <i>Applications requiring decryption</i> <br><br>  Most of them are related to file transfer. <br></div></div><br>  <b>Thus, decryption is needed so that the notification of users about blocking works.</b>  <b>Although only for this, I would not cook all this compote.</b> <br><br>  IPS signatures and file policies, including Advanced Malware Protection (AMP), do not work for encrypted traffic.  And this is logical: to search for malware, traffic must be decrypted.  Here it should be understood that a deep inspection will not work for payload.  For the information that is transmitted in open form (IP headers, TCP headers, SSL Handshake messages) signatures will work. <br><br>  From the point of view of IPS, the protection of incoming traffic is more interesting.  If we publish a Web server to the Internet and want to protect it with IPS, then SSL sessions will be initiated outside.  It does not make sense to decrypt them with certificate substitution: why change one own certificate to another? <br><br>  For such a task on FirePOWER, decryption with the private key is provided.  That is, the certificate of the published server and the corresponding private key are preloaded on FirePOWER.  It will be used to decrypt a session running outside.  This option in the framework of this material will not be considered. <br><br>  The last use of decryption is traffic monitoring. <br><br>  As a result, which may require decryption of traffic on FirePOWER: <br><br><ol><li>  EUN mapping for blocked sites and web applications; </li><li>  Traffic analysis with IPS signatures; </li><li>  Control of file transfer, including the analysis of files by the AMP system; </li><li>  Recognition of some applications; </li><li>  Monitoring </li></ol><br>  I think it‚Äôs clear now why decrypt SSL to NGFW (as well as UTM, Web proxy) in principle.  In this case, I sorted out the subject using the example of FirePOWER.  However, I am sure that on other solutions the situation will be similar.  If this is not quite the case - write. <br><br>  <b><i>The <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/cbs/blog/318592/">following material</a> will tell you how it is decryption works with the substitution of the certificate on the NGFW.</i></b>  <b><i>Stay tuned.</i></b> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/318326/">https://habr.com/ru/post/318326/</a></p>
