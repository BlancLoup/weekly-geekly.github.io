  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Informal Runet Conference - iCamp Russia will be held in three cities at once from July 24 to 28</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  On July 24 - 28 of this year, an informal Runet conference - <a href="http://icamp2009.ru/">iCamp Russia</a> will be held in three Russian cities: Nizhny Novgorod, Kazan and Cheboksary. <br>  iCamp Russia is an international platform for informal communication of people whose activities are related to the Internet and the latest information technologies. <br>  The meaning of iCamp in its atmosphere, and this year it will be special.  It will be created by a four-deck white motor ship ‚ÄúGeorge Zhukov‚Äù and a team of Internet industry gurus, cozy negotiation and free workshops on brandy tasting, shooting a film based on ‚Äú12 chairs‚Äù and ‚ÄúElection Day‚Äù and a big role-playing game on the future of the Internet. <br><br>  We will start working with the future on July 24 in the building of the Chamber of Commerce and Industry of Nizhny Novgorod.  A ‚ÄúFuture Scene‚Äù will be open throughout the day, at which recognized Russian and foreign gurus will speak on major trends in the Internet and information technologies (as well as design, media, education, work spaces, etc.). <br>  Once on iCamp Russia, get rid of stereotypes from your head.  They interfere with working with the future.  Namely, this will have to do eikemperm for five days. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The motto and the main idea of ‚Äã‚ÄãiCamp Russia: ‚ÄúWe do not know what the future will be.  But we are working on it! ‚Äù <br>  The traditional format of "conferences" with "reports" is completely out of date.  Today, the participants work together to create their future: their businesses, their work, their social projects, social support networks.  For five days, iCamp Russia participants will analyze the main trends in the development of the country and the world, the risks and opportunities for the Internet industry, plan joint actions and projects, develop new products and immediately run them over with partners and investors. <br>  In ‚Äúhard times‚Äù, it‚Äôs not the money that helps out, but the density of social connections.  iCamp Russia will give you a lot of new friends and partners.  Going down the ship‚Äôs ramp on the last day of the conference, each of the iCamp participants will be able to say that they received much more than they spent. <br><br>  At five other sites, various activities will take place: communication of venture investors with representatives of promising start-ups, the American educational Fast-track program for those who run their innovative businesses in Russia, a master class from the CEO of Moscow Business School ‚Äú7 steps to get venture financing , Classic barcamp, Forest programs, blitz presentations and more. <br>  Anyone can visit iCamp Russia in Nizhny Novgorod.  The number of participants is limited only by the size of the room - no more than 1000 people.

      The Nizhny Novgorod part of iCamp Russia is held within the framework of the All-Russian Internet Marathon, organized by the Russian Public Center for Internet Technologies (ROCIT). <br>  We will continue to create images of the future on July 25 on the ship ‚ÄúGeorgy Zhukov‚Äù, which in the morning will be removed from the anchor and go to Kazan. <br>  On board will be seven to eight simultaneous streams of the work program.  Over four days, about a hundred different events will be held, organized by the participants of iCamp Russia themselves. <br><br>  Several groups of ikemperov will work on more dense programs.  In particular, the Fast-track business planning program will continue for representatives of Russian start-ups.  At least 15 free trainings will take place: from the Moscow Business School training in preparing an investment plan for obtaining venture financing, to training on the art of making presentations and working with mental maps (mindmaps).  According to the results of business games, four aikempers will receive ‚Äúvouchers‚Äù for MBA educational programs as prizes. <br>  A large-scale situational analysis will be held on the prospects of the Internet market and the education market in Russia, with a consulting program for new projects and joint modeling of new businesses. <br><br>  Representatives of the media community "retire" to develop the concept of "journal of the future."  Subsequently, the concept can be adopted for the implementation of one of the world's largest magazine brands. <br><br>  Representatives of social Internet projects will also have their own party.  Directly on iCamp Russia, they will begin to conceptually work out the autumn SocialCamp - an event on social and civic activity on the Internet, which will be held in late October of this year. <br><br>  Various events will be held by the partner companies of iCamp Russia.  What - while a secret. <br><br>  Of course, we cannot do without an open barcamp program, which is the ‚Äúcalling card‚Äù of iCamp Russia. <br><br>  On July 26, the ship ‚ÄúGeorgy Zhukov‚Äù will arrive in Kazan, where representatives of the Kazan Internet community will join the aikemper for the whole day. <br>  On July 27, we will briefly moor in Cheboksary and will also call guests to the ship. <br>  July 28 is the last day of iCamp Russia, which will end with a final concert.  As in the past year, the author of the anthem iCamp Russia, the St. Petersburg ethno-fusion project ‚ÄúMinus Trill‚Äù, will be the headliner of the concert.  They will present a completely new program on the ship - the result of work on a new disc that has not yet been released. <br>  Of course, iCamp Russia is not only a work program, but also an exciting vacation. <br>  On the evening of July 24 in Nizhny Novgorod, there will be a ‚ÄúBenevolent Party‚Äù with a free tasting of good cognacs and wines. <br>  All five days of the event, one of the Nizhny Novgorod video studios will shoot an interactive film about iCamp Russia (based on ‚Äú12 chairs‚Äù and ‚ÄúElection Day‚Äù), the content and plot of which will be determined by the aikempers themselves. <br><br>  Of course, there will be a search for prizes in 12 chairs.  True, with chairs - quite in the format of the future - we will have bin-bags (light ottoman chairs that take the shape of a body). <br>  Of course, get ready for a simul session and a drawing contest. <br>  The heroes of the ‚Äú12 chairs‚Äù - Ostap Bender and Kisa Vorobyaninov will also be present on the ship.  In what form - while the secret. <br><br>  Of course, all that we talked about is only a part of iCamp Russia, which can be created by the efforts of the organizers.  The second (perhaps the main) part of iCamp Russia is its unique atmosphere, which is created by each participant who came to an informal conference. <br>  We are waiting for you at iCamp Russia! <br>  ‚ÄúWe do not know what the future will be.  But we are working on it! ‚Äù <br>  Yours sincerely, iCamp Russia Organizing Committee. <br><habracut></habracut></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/61235/">https://habr.com/ru/post/61235/</a></p>
