Well, a couple of answers to frequently asked questions that have been asked since the last publication. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h1>  VLC Extended </h1><br>  Do you like to watch movies on 2 monitors?  not a question, but if you work in a digital electronics store, then you can look at it on all screens placed on your shelves.  No, no, you don‚Äôt need to install anything, because you probably already have VLC. This program will definitely allow you to watch a movie on 81 monitors, although you can watch 99 rows in width and 99 in length, which gives us 9801 screens, try to deploy 1 monitor did not dare =)

      How it works for at least two, you ask ... I answer: <br>  <b>- CTRL + E (Extended Settings) - Video Effects - Vbut / Overlay</b> <br>  - Put a tick on <b>Wall</b> , your video will be displayed in the windows in the number (by default), change to the required number of fields, remove the tick, and put a tick again.  Then we arrange each window on the desired screen and that's it. <br><br><img src="http://pic.ipicture.ru/uploads/091101/BfaHu4bRm1.jpg"><br><br>  I do not know why it was invented, but perhaps this fun element has already been repeatedly used for its intended purpose.  For example, I would probably teach children logic, giving the opportunity to assemble a puzzle from a cartoon that they could then normally see, with a sense of accomplishment.  This is another interesting video effect with an interactive feature - " <b>Puzzle Game</b> ". <br><br><img src="http://pic.ipicture.ru/uploads/091101/2RT3RtCBhf.jpg"><br><br>  How it works: <br>  <b>- CTRL + E (Extended Settings) - Video Effects - Vbut / Overlay</b> <br><br>  I did not go into all the delights of plug-ins and filters, you can try them out yourself ( <b>CTRL + E (Extended Settings))</b> , I advise you to pay attention to the ‚ÄúBlurred motion‚Äù filter, which works approximately as a quick movement of vampires and other evil spirits.  In addition, there are clarity amplifiers and more. <br><br><h1>  We listen to Podcasts and redirect them to stream. </h1><br>  Recently there was an opportunity to listen to Podcasts, but it was clearly not a bright feature after the release, and little was mentioned about it, but you should definitely pay attention to it: <br>  <b>CTRL + P, Show settings (All).</b>  <b>Playlist - Search Services - Podcasts</b> , and add a podcast feed. <br>  After that, just go to <br>  - <b>Media - Services Discovery - Podcasts</b> (For loading added tape) <br>  - <b>Media - Services Discovery - Configure Podcasts</b> (To edit and add new tapes.) <br><br><img src="http://pic.ipicture.ru/uploads/091101/0VvVReH25F.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  If this is not enough for you, and you want to redirect one incoming podcast stream to another computer, or broadcast to a local network, it‚Äôs enough to set up the podcast broadcast to the network (I will give an example on ‚Äúhttp‚Äù, although for this purpose we recommend ‚ÄúUDP‚Äù. just listen, and ‚Äúhttp‚Äù was your remote management interface) <br>  1. After adding a podcast, or list of songs, <br>  2. <b>CTRL + Y</b> to save the playlist that we feed to <b>VLC</b> for further streaming. <br>  3. <b>CTRL + S</b> for Stream, and in the window that appears, add a playlist file and click on <b>Stream</b> , - <b>Next</b> , - Here we think about how we will broadcast, select <b>UDP</b> and click the <b>Add</b> button, enter the IP or host, and port on which we will broadcast .  Next, select the MP3 format, if necessary, then customize it.  After that, just click <b>Stream</b> . <br>  4. Then you should launch the Web Interface by going to <b>View - Add Interface - Web Interface.</b> <br><br>  <b>PS:</b> in the process of creating all these steps, you can click on the <b>Options</b> button and pay attention to the generated code that you can use in the command line or in the batch file.  To check, I will show a screen from the admin web interface, which displays what is being broadcast now. <br><br><img src="http://pic.ipicture.ru/uploads/091101/bY1ZWFSYU7.jpg"><br><br>  - In the same way, we can make our radio station by feeding VLC a pre-made playlist, or simply by selecting a stack of audio or video files. <br><br>  - In order to gain access to online radio stations and TV, you need to do the following ... <br>  1. Go to <b>Media</b> - <b>Services Discovery</b> - and select <b>Shoutcast radio</b> (tv) <b>streaming</b> <br>  2. After that we go to the <b>View - Playlist (CTRL + L)</b> , our podcasts and radio and video streams are already living here, we choose and listen, and if you have carefully read the last post on this topic, then you can easily connect to listening through the Web interface and listen from an iPhone or PDA in another room or bathroom :). <br>  2.1.  Please note that you can load covers and filter radio stations with search queries. <br>  2.2 Please also note that you can immediately start broadcasting the received radio stream to the network directly from the playlist. <br><br><img src="http://pic.ipicture.ru/uploads/091101/JnpX7R2y1J.jpg"><br><br><h1>  Making ScreenCast With VLC </h1><br>  In order to shoot video from your screen, it is enough to do the following: <br>  1. <b>CTRL + C, - Capture Mode (Desktop)</b> <br>  2. Choose the number of frames with which we will do the shooting.  Next two times <b>Next</b> . <br>  3. In the section N <b>ew Destination</b> there are a lot of opportunities where you can shove what we are going to take off the screen. <br>  - Save locally to file; <br>  - Broadcast to the network ( <i>It is possible to use for training remote employees or friends</i> ); <br>  and you can also broadcast on different protocols and save to a local file at the same time, if you have both the power and the channel to allow it. <br>  4. Next, select / edit codecs and click " <b>Stream</b> ". <br><br>  PS: If you tick the <b>Display Locally</b> checkbox, this function will immediately open the video of what you are doing ( <i>at the first start I was even scared when I saw the sets of my desktops fading into each other =</i> ) maybe it will be useful for someone, but it gives additional load on the CPU. <br><br><h1>  We send music data to your profile on LAST.FM </h1><br>  Once again we have the opportunity to demolish all unnecessary additional software, in this case Scrobbler LAST.FM <br><br>  Now VLC does a great job with VLC, I didn‚Äôt have time to test it, because as I finished writing the article I found out that the tracks often appear in the profile and widgets for up to two days.  Therefore, I‚Äôll just explain how to run it on VLC and decide on this. <br><br>  Click <b>CTRL + P.</b>  then ( <b>Show Settings - All</b> ) and go to / <b>Interface - Control Interface - Audioscrobbler</b> , that's all, specify the Login and password from Last.fm, save, and the next time you start VLC will scrobble your tracks. <br><br>  - FAQ <br>  1.If you *** your VLC to such an extent that it does not work or the interface is not visible at all <br>  1. run it with parameters: <br> <code>-I qt</code> <br>  2. Go to <b>C: \ Users \\ AppData \ Roaming \ vlc \ vlcrc</b> <br>  there should be configs, edit or kill, VLC will recreate them. <br><br>  2. If you like Mplayer and want the same ‚Äúnon-GUI‚Äù VLC, then run it with parameters: <br> <code>vlc -Irc</code> <br>  or <br> <code>-Idummy</code> <br>  and to run VLC as a Server without a GUI, use <br> <code>-Itelnet</code> <br>  For telnet, or for http respectively <br> <code>vlc -Ihttp</code> <br> <br>  3. If you have a proxy, and you cannot enjoy all the pleasures of online work with VLC, whether it be downloading covers, listening to the radio, or scrobbling, then run VLC with the parameters: <br> <code>--http-proxy=_:</code> <br>  eg: <br>  <b>vlc --http-proxy = 192.168.0.2: 8080</b> <br>  3. How to run the Logger, which is on my screenshots <br> <code>-vvv --extraintf logger</code> <br> <br>  <b>PS:</b> I did not go into all the subtleties of the settings, and left the most interesting thing to smoke for you, just sent in the right direction, if you have questions, on the possibilities and functions, you can open the VLC blog, and then we can expand it in each post / functions in full and with all comments. <br>  I hope this information was useful for you. <br><br>  <b>UPD: I</b> completely forgot, VLC has an option that allows you to use not embedded codecs installed on the system (for example, k-lite, etc.), which, according to the developer, improves the quality of work with video, encoding / screencasting, and so on.  and for watching rips and regular video, there‚Äôs enough of what‚Äôs in the program. <br><br>  <b>UPD2:</b> - VLC does play / convert / save videos from <b>Youtube</b> , <br><br><img src="http://pic.ipicture.ru/uploads/091101/x2m5US2xq0.jpg"><br><br>  This is done like this: <br>  1. To open a YouTube video for viewing, it is enough to press CTRL + N (Media - Network Stream), and insert a link like <br><pre>  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bu1k34Ci5ry </pre><br>  2. To convert save, <b>CTRL + S (Media - Streaming) - Network</b> , paste the link, and then <b>Stream</b> into File or <b>Convert</b> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/73982/">https://habr.com/ru/post/73982/</a></p>
