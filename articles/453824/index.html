  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How will the collaboration and viewing video with the advent of 5G</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/-g/zp/kz/-gzpkzbql9k8h6b7dmz9s3ofpc4.png"><br><br>  In the first articles on how the advent of 5G technology can change people's daily lives, we talked about games and augmented reality.  But this is only a small part of the opportunities that new generation networks offer us.  Therefore, today we will talk about what 5G technologies are still capable of, namely, how they will change collaboration technologies and view videos on mobile devices. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h3>  Evolution of collaborative technology <br></h3><br>  When working together on a project on the Internet, people face certain problems and limitations.  And this applies to a variety of areas - from editing video files to making changes to a common document.  Several employees can work on one document at once, but poor communication quality and high latency at least for one of them create problems for everyone else: changes in the document in this case will not be displayed in real time, so someone might, for example, start edit a paragraph that another employee is already working with.  This leads to confusion and unnecessary time. <br><br>  Uploading and downloading files, especially when it comes to heavy 4K video clips, may take a lot longer than we would like.  At the same time, the availability of high-speed connection and its quality significantly limit our mobility.

      5G technology can help deal with these problems.  For example, one of the participants in a student film crew shoots a high-resolution video on their smartphone and unloads it into a common ‚Äúcloud‚Äù during the shooting process.  Other students with access to the ‚Äúcloud‚Äù are working on editing this video in real time, and several people can simultaneously process each frame.  And recall, the video itself at this time continues to be shot and laid out in the "cloud".  So each of the group members will see the work of their colleagues, which will allow to achieve maximum productivity and avoid downtime due to the expectation of new material.  Moreover, to work on such a project outside the studio, the mobile Internet is sufficient, because, due to the tremendous speed and minimal delay, the 5G networks are quite capable of coping with such a load. <br><br><h3>  Evolution of technology for viewing content <br></h3><br>  How much our approach to viewing content has changed over the past years is a hot topic, but not a new one.  We have long ceased to switch between TV channels in search of interesting programs and instead watch our favorite shows on streaming services at a convenient time for us.  And we are increasingly doing this, sitting not in front of the TV or monitor screen, but picking up a smartphone or tablet.  And with the advent of the 5G era, both the viewing methods and the visual content itself will change so much that it is even difficult to imagine. <br><br>  Using unlimited augmented reality with photo-realistic graphics without unnecessary wires and with support for 6DoF, that is, six degrees of freedom of movement, we can get into the worlds that were previously only viewed on the screens of their gadgets and monitors.  With technologies of limitless augmented reality, it will be possible, say, to forget about passively watching a football match in front of the TV and get the best seats in the stadium, even those for which tickets are not for sale.  Moreover, it will be possible to walk on the playing field, consider each of the players and watch the game ‚Äúfrom the inside‚Äù. <br><br>  With 5G technology, not only the degree of immersion when watching video content will increase, and the social aspect will change.  For example, it will be possible to view all the same football game with his friend, when everyone is sitting at home.  And on the ‚Äúcommon‚Äù screen for you will be displayed a variety of information, from the broadcast of the match itself to player statistics, multimedia content and video chat windows.  So there will be more opportunities for interaction and much more comfort when communicating.  And, when the judge will appoint a penalty, you can see the reaction of a friend and immediately start the repetition of this controversial moment to arrange a joint frame-by-frame analysis. <br><br>  The high data transfer rate and minimal latency of 5G networks, as well as the use of AI technologies, open the door to the introduction of completely new possibilities for personalizing content and ‚Äúsmart‚Äù functions. <br><br>  While watching a football match on the ‚Äúcommon‚Äù screen, the AI ‚Äã‚Äãwill be able to independently switch between camera angles, zoom in on the image and launch the replay of the ‚Äúhot‚Äù moments of the game.  At the same time, the speed and bandwidth of 5G networks allow using not only cloud computing for AI operation.  With the era of 5G, the time comes for distributed computing and Wireless Edge technologies (wireless systems at the junction of networks and gadgets).  All these technologies can unleash the potential of new-generation networks and open up completely new scenarios for using gadgets and opportunities that will soon become part of our daily life. <br><br>  Stay tuned - the next article about interesting possibilities for the practical application of 5G technologies will tell about purchases and social interaction in the network. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/453824/">https://habr.com/ru/post/453824/</a></p>
