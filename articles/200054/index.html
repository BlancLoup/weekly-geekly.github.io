In the comments the right things, but the relevance today is nonsense.  Today, a 100 W solar panel (in Ukraine) costs up to $ 100, controllers, batteries - all this is not very stressful.  But the biggest snag of green progress is that people simply do not understand what solar energy is, how to realize everything correctly, and why it is necessary and in general ... <br><br>  Not for promotional purposes.  I sell solar panels on the market and 90 out of 100 people push this innovation as mobile phones repelled 15 years ago - it's expensive, not necessary, not profitable, and so good.  Many people want to dial panels at $ 100 per 10 kilowatts and not pay for electricity.  Count yourself - 100 W x10 = 1kW * 10 = 10 kW = 10,000 dollars.  It is only on the panel, without batteries and controllers.  Batteries per hour of work load of 10 kW need another 12-13 pieces of 100 A / h (another $ 200 each), etc.  As a result, they look at the seller as an idiot, throw everything out of their heads that they are telling, and in this very head one thing remains: "I am not interested."  In fact, everything is a little different. <br><br>  <b>Why are solar panels made?</b>  <b>What is the meaning of human life?</b>  <b>Why do we breathe dirty air?</b>  <b>Save the planet, free Willy!</b>

      These questions can be many answers, I will try to explain more or less clearly how I see it. <br><a name="habracut"></a>  A solar panel is a device that converts solar radiation into electrical current.  More solar panels have no functions.  They were not created for economy, for beauty, for bragging.  Since the sun does not always shine the same, but does not shine at night, it is logical to use electric power storage devices - batteries.  Plus clouds, seasons, temperatures, etc.  - all these are factors that prevent panels from giving all the time stable energy.  So, I propose to consider the option of autonomous lighting for a private house, and then substitute your data into formulas and calculate the system for you. <br><br>  Take the worst time of the year - winter.  In winter in Ukraine, a sunny day lasts from the power of 8 hours, plus there are clouds ... <b>NO!</b>  <b>STOP!</b>  In my experience - no need to start the calculation of the amount of money or the price tag of $ 100 on the panel 100 watts.  Initially, you must select the load.  To illuminate the cottage in two rooms and the area in front of the house, we need 5 meters of LED strip.  We will place three meters in the house, and let two of them light on the gazebo and the area in front of the house.  By experience - this is more than enough for a standard suburban area of ‚Äã‚Äã5 acres with a small house.  The tape can be wound on a glass bottle, having made such bulbs, on the street in the gazebo just stick it under the roof, and sell the lighting area in the case from under a standard searchlight, throwing out the cartridge under the halogen lamp.  In general, everyone does what he wants, this is his right.  We are here about formulas and calculations. <br><br>  So.  5 meters of superbright LED tape 5050 will consume a maximum of 5 A per hour at 12 V. We want us to have lighting in the house for an hour.  After all, no one sits in the house longer, right?  (this is 2 A - 2 meters of tape 1A each meter, recorded).  In the gazebo for 4 hours (1 meter of tape 1A, plus 4A plus) and on the territory of 8 hours (2 meters of tape 2A, another 16A).  A total consumption of 22 Amperes per night (~ 270 W at 12V) is recorded. <br><br>  To provide autonomous lighting in the country, we need a 2 + 4 + 16 battery = 22 A / h.  There are 25-26 A / h batteries on sale, its cost in Ukraine is about 450-550 UAH (55-65 dollars, meaning a multi-gel battery).  To fully charge this battery, we need to charge it with 2.5 A for 10 hours.  In the summer, when the sun and all is well, it will give us a solar panel 50 watts.  But suddenly it was raining, winter, just overcast, the bird stuffed up one cell and it turned into a parasitic cell - I suggest we take a 100 W panel, it gives current to 6A, in any case we will have 2.2-2.5A (the price of the panel is 100 W Ukraine, 800 UAH, $ 100). <br><br>  I already wrote that the panels do not give all the time a stable current and voltage.  To do this, use the charge controller for solar panels.  The controller not only protects the battery from overcharging and overdischarge, but also regulates the charge voltage depending on the ambient temperature (the price of the controller for 10A in Ukraine is $ 18-20, recorded). <br><br>  In general, we came to the finish line.  Based on the calculations, it did not happen that to illuminate the country house, the plot and the gazebo we need: <br>  5 meters of super-bright LED tape -20 dollars <br>  Solar panel 100 W - $ 100 <br>  10A charge controller - $ 20 <br>  Battery 26 A / h - $ 65 <br>  Cable - how many people need, let the bay ShVVP 2x2.5 100m, 60 dollars <br><br>  Total: 265 dollars and we have all our own, all for free (you must admit, this is not hundreds of thousands of dollars with the stupid approach from the wrong side).  The biggest disappointment comes precisely at the moment of the final calculation - this system will never pay for itself.  After 5 years, you will have to change the battery, after 20 years the panel, after a week you will want to connect another TV / radio / laptop / tablet and you will have to add batteries and panels. <br><br>  But ask yourself: ‚ÄúWhy do I need all this?‚Äù <br><br>  1. Solar panels are used where there is no electricity at all or it is very expensive (for example, in Ukraine, enterprises pay 5 times more than ordinary consumers and they have a limit over which the tariff rises 20 times) <br>  2. This is autonomy and independence.  You do not depend on natural disasters, on the vagaries of the energy supplying company. <br>  3. It is fashionable, it is beautiful and stylish.  You can reassure yourself even by charging a mobile phone, you have not burned a ton of oil :) <br><br>  PS To reduce the cost of the system.  You can use any <s>stolen</s> old waste battery.  It is not necessary to take 5 meters of super-bright tape, it is possible and usual for 120 diodes or 60 diodes and you do not always need 5 meters.  Do not turn on the lighting all night, save! <br>  PSS The panel does not need to be put on the roof, it is possible in the garden or on the wall - almost vertically.  It will be even better, because in the winter the sun "goes" low and it is better to make the system before winter, in the summer and so it will pin down. <br>  PSSS Do not seek to assemble the system on huge panels of 200-300 watts.  There is no difference between the price of Watt 100 and 200, but the sail on your wall will be pretty big and heavy, no matter how hard it is.  IMHO better two or three "weave" than one large panel. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/200054/">https://habr.com/ru/post/200054/</a></p>
