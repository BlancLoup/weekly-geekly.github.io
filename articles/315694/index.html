  <section class="page js-page"><h1>We continue to set up almost free advertising on Habr users. This time using the authorization widget</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The day before last, I pointed out the not obvious vulnerability of Habra, <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/post/301730/">which allowed to insert the VC retargeting pixel</a> into the necessary articles for collecting the maximum target audience and further advertising on it through the social network. <br><br>  Thanks to the efforts of the developers, this problem was successfully fixed within a few days, but our saga is not over.  Let me remind you that according to the official price list of Habr, the cost of 1000 banner impressions for resource users ranges from 400 to 550 rubles.  For geo-targeting in Moscow and Peter will have to pay 20 and 15 percent, respectively. <br><br>  But there is still a way to advertise to the same audience by paying 30-150 rubles per thousand impressions.  Let's think about how to fix this feature: 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>
        <script>
          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
    <img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/6dd/4e2/ee5/6dd4e2ee5b74454da3c91d6540859b5c.jpg" alt="image"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  It will be about the authorization widget through social networks.  The method described below works with ANY site where there is an opportunity to make an entrance through VK. <br><br>  Click on the Login button and select Vkontakte.  The following screen appears: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/75b/0ec/ef1/75b0ecef1ef444bfa149c99ba81426d2.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The red oval is <b>client_id</b> .  Sometimes it is at the beginning, sometimes at the end of a line, but I have not yet seen a site where it would not exist.  We copy the digits after the equal sign (in the case of Habr, this is <b>3110645</b> ) and go to the advertising office Vkontakte. <br><br>  We paste the resulting number into the Applications section and the sites of the VC advertising cabinet, and we get the following results: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/552/7e5/bbd/5527e5bbd4714fea830c3e4162f32b33.png" alt="image"><br><br>  145 thousand people who logged in to Habr√© using the VK widget (frankly, I‚Äôm not completely sure what the time interval is).  Using the VC tools, we indicate the necessary parameters of the audience (gender / age / geographic location) and get the opportunity to advertise for this target audience 5-10 times cheaper than the official price of Habr. <br><br>  But let's move away from our favorite site for a second and think about where this feature can still be applied.  Suppose that you have an online clothing store, and you would like to advertise to people who are more likely to buy in similar online stores. <br><br>  How to get to the hottest audience? <br><br>  We pass on the top of the Runet, looking at all kinds of Lamoda and get access to the audience, which at least logged in on their sites (and most likely interested in buying).  A similar trick can be done with any online store and project in which there are competitors with strong sites.  And authorization widgets. <br><br>  This works great for digital projects as well.  For example, if you advertise courses on layout, you can always collect users of htmlacademy.ru and a whole group of similar projects that, as a rule, have authorization through social networks. <br><br>  There may be a lot of examples of application, but the main message is that such a trick helps to reach the audience, which is usually not so easy to reach. <br><br>  How ethical is using this method?  I understand that in the eyes of most programmers I will look like a bad person for recognizing the use of this method (and I use it very often).  At the same time, I am convinced that there are two types of vulnerabilities. <br><br>  On one side of the barricades are tricks and tricks to help reach the target audience with maximum efficiency (this can be attributed to the above method, and, for example, the story of the substitution of pictures in the same ill-fated Contact, when, contrary to the rules of the site, it was possible to contact the user by name / age, replacing the image in promo post after moderation), on the other - methods, the purpose of which is to CHEAT the user.  As, for example, the substitution of the results of contests on random.org with the help of simple scripts that generate any desired number under the guise of "random". <br><br>  The first ones help to achieve steep results by showing advertisements to the most interested users (there is nothing wrong with advertising a good product for a person to whom this product may be useful).  For the latter, you need to punish a **** but, tearing off the hands and feet of a bad person. <br><br>  Be smart, but do not become these very!  Well, if suddenly you want to learn a little more about the behind-the-scenes life of online promotion, you can always subscribe <a href="https://telegram.me/smmhero">to a cozy telegram channel</a> , where I sometimes share interesting observations that cannot be turned into a full-fledged post. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/315694/">https://habr.com/ru/post/315694/</a></p>
