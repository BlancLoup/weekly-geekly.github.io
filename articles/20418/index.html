  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Ah, this google!</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Honestly, I can hardly imagine why you can not love Google.  Not one of his services has ever caused me any complaints, and the number and variety of these services can satisfy, perhaps, most of the needs of the Runet user. <br>  Let's try to "review" the main and most popular services? .. If someone did it before me (which is very, very likely), I apologize for the duplication, but I really want to)) Therefore, I write as a personal one in order to express myself without claims for uniqueness). <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Itaaks. <br>  First of all, about the search.  It is unlikely that there will be anyone who will dispute the fact that there is a palm of search for this particular service.  The search is the coolest and most complete.  But he's not just stupid search) However, more to the point and more specifics. <br><ul><li>  Google cache.  Pages are indexed and indexed, and then stolen by UFOs.  But what if a UFO stole <em>that</em> <strong>very</strong> important page? .. No problem - Google can easily repair your page at the time of its last indexing.  For the link "stored in the cache", following each search result, there is a page dragged down even to the farthest corner of the galaxy. </li><li>  Definitions  Google is a great determiner!) Dal's worthy heir.  If you enter define before a search query, Google will perform a heroic search on Wikipedia and provide us with information about the term.  <font color="gray">By the way, according to the statistics of requests, users most of all like to define a computer and Cthulhu.</font>  <font color="gray">Last but not least, the query define define love - Google is also addressed for philosophical questions)</font> </li><li>  Do you need a specific file type? .. For example, .doc?  No problems.  The request <u>file_type: doc</u> will find you MS Office‚Äôs documents containing the <u>request‚Äôs essence</u> .  Nothing prevents to search among PDF, for example, of course) </li><li>  Search for links to the object.  Especially important for owners of blogs and websites - allows you to calculate who, when and why referred to your materials.  link: will help you. </li></ul><br>  These are the most underused functions of Google search engine, about which I decided to enlighten, if anyone is not up to date.  In addition, Google has a calculator, a currency converter and even a weather forecaster).  A request for weather: the settlement will allow you to determine whether to wear a sheepskin coat or shorts today, to get an umbrella or sunglasses. <br><br>  If you decide to create an account, then the iGoogle page is at your service, which is very convenient to hang your homepage.  The concept of iGoogle is the so-called <em>gadgets</em> , which you can place in any order and customize at your own discretion, while dealing with a friendly and understandable interface.  Gadgets are different - black, white, red.  But seriously, the weather, jokes, arbitrary webcam, sticky notes, bookmarks, news, holidays, and Gmail are all convenient, compact and on the same page.  Estets can choose a theme to suit your taste. <br>  There is such a thing as Google AdSense.  I just started an account there, so I don‚Äôt have the moral right to go into specifics, because I haven‚Äôt studied the program thoroughly enough, but everything looks quite tasty, and the reviews are generally positive.  AdSense is a way to make money on advertising on your blog / website by inserting a Google ad block of links into it.  Everything is customizable and, in principle, does not spoil anything, as banners of other affiliate programs crippling the whole color gamut of the page and capable of triggering an epileptic seizure with an abundance of dynamics in predisposed juzverej).  But, I repeat, I have not tried it yet and have not received money from them.  Money, by the way, comes by check, and, as far as I understand, it is more pleasant and less labor-intensive to use special services for cash withdrawals. <br>  Gmail  Just a good post.  Despite the fact that the service is provided with the mark ‚ÄúBeta‚Äù, there were no glitches.  The spam filter hasn‚Äôt missed anything yet and hasn‚Äôt cut anything desirable, and over 6000 mb of disk space after corporate 10 people made me send Jimmail‚Äôs address on my business card because I‚Äôve dealt with very large messages on the nature of my business. <br><br>  In general, so far everyone) This does not mean at all that Google services are limited to this list, just until I needed others.  Now here I‚Äôll try out Google`vsky blogger.com service, maybe I'll write something else.  Thank you for your attention and sorry again, if the topic is too dirty, just have a google attack) <br></div>
