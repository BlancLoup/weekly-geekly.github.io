A copy of this letter is recommended to be sent to the regional prosecutor's office.  According to the recommendation, if there is no response within two months, a second appeal should be sent to Rosprirodnadzor and the Prosecutor General‚Äôs Office of the Russian Federation, and after another two months, to the President of the Russian Federation.

      <u>So let's start</u> : the total weight of the paper (one A4 sheet with a density of 80 g / square meter) required for such correspondence will be about 50 grams (5 sheets of A4 paper - total weight about 31 grams; five envelopes 114x162 - total weight about 18 grams, plus stamps).  The production of one ton of paper requires an average of 2 tons of wood, i.e.  about 17 trees.  Thus, written complaints from one person to illegal logging require turning into paper about 100g of wood.  1176 complainers and one tree as it did not happen. <br>  - <br>  <strong><u>CARRYING OUT THE WORLD DAY WITHOUT CARS LEADS TO 72 CAPTS OF CARBON-GAS GAS INTO ATMOSPHERE</u></strong> <br><br>  At rest, a person passes 700-800 liters of air through the lungs for an hour, absorbing 30 liters of oxygen and exhaling 20-25 liters of carbon dioxide. <br>  An active breathing pedestrian during a walk overcomes an average of 5.4 km per hour, passing 1080 liters of air through the lungs, absorbing as much as 54 liters of oxygen and exhaling 46 liters of carbon dioxide.  To compensate for the calories expended during the walk, you need to eat about 100g of meat.  At the same time, the production of one kilogram of meat, according to the magazine New Scientist, costs 36 kg of greenhouse gases.  A car that has traveled the same distance will emit about 0.8 kg of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere (according to modern environmental standards).  Thus, the refusal of 100 million inhabitants of more than 1500 cities of the world from cars in favor of hiking will cost at least 72 thousand additional tons of carbon dioxide. <br>  - <br><br>  <strong><u>ORGANIZED BY THE GOVERNMENT OF MOSCOW THE ENERGY SAVING INFORMATION CAMPAIGN CONSUMES 2 MILLION KW / H OF ADDITIONAL ELECTRIC ENERGY FOR THE FLOOR OF THE YEAR</u></strong> <br>  As part of the company, on the streets of the capital and other major cities of Russia, according to the organizers, more than a thousand billboards were sealed with the calls ‚ÄúSave electricity,‚Äú Do not forget to turn off the lights before leaving, ‚Äù‚Äú Use table lamps often, ‚Äù‚Äú Save light by day ‚Äù, Use the energy of the sun ‚Äúetc.  To illuminate a billboard in the autumn-winter season (approximately 11 hours a day from 7 pm to 6 am) it takes two (or even three) searchlights with a power of 500 W, which consume 11 kW / h during the day.  If we take into account that the information campaign is still going on, then it was necessary to spend at least 2 million kilowatt-hours per hour to illuminate the 1,000 involved billboards in only six months of last year‚Äôs autumn-winter season. <br>  - <br><br>  <strong><u>PARTY OF MATCHES WITH LABEL "KEEP THE FOREST" OR "KEEP THE NATURE" DEMANDS TO DESTROY THREE TREES</u></strong> <br>  From one cubic meter of wood it turns out 20 thousand boxes of matches, and the minimum circulation of the lot in large-scale production is 100,000.  Thus, the production takes 5 cubic meters of linden or aspen or two or three trees.  depending on the quality of raw materials, and the waste in production is more than 60%.  This is not counting the amount of wood (20 kg) that is required for the production of 10 kg of label paper. <br>  - <br>  <strong><u>CULTIVATION OF 1 TONN OF ORGANIC VEGETABLES IN COLD COUNTRIES INCREASES THE NUMBER OF ADDITIONAL CARBON GAS EMISSIONS BY 13 THOUSAND CUBOMETERS</u></strong> <br><br>  <strong><u>1000 GREENPEACE ROLLER'S ‚ÄúECONOMY ELECTRICITY!‚Äù THROUGHOUT WAY OF APPROXIMATELY 23 KW / H ADDITIONAL ELECTRIC ENERGY</u></strong> <br><br>  <em>PS If someone is interested in the calculations of the last 2 headers, write to kamenty, I will add.</em> <em><br></em>  <em>PPS All figures used for calculations are obtained from different sources using Google and Yandex</em> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/16024/">https://habr.com/ru/post/16024/</a></p>
