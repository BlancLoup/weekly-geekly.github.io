  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Webinar: "To people about managers". Wednesday, February 10, 17.30 Moscow time</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  We decided to conduct an experiment and conduct our open seminars also through webinars. <br><br>  <b>What are we going to talk about?</b> <br>  - We will warm up with an example of maltitasking. <br>  - Next, we will talk about 2 very different ways of creating "Value to people". <br>  - Let's talk about what managers are, why you need to go there consciously and prepared.  How it usually happens.  About why a sane manager is a rarity. <br>  - Let's talk about what managers are, why you need to know how to use this knowledge. <br>  - I will briefly tell the modern theory of management, what is teamwork.  I will show due to what the right team "makes" singles. <br>  - Let's talk a little about different types of projects and why it is important for employees to know. <br>  - Let's talk about different types of companies, about the development cycles of the company.  And again, from the point of view of the employee and management.  Why is it all important and how to use. <br>  ‚ÄúAnd we‚Äôll end up with some amazing examples of good management, which were told by the very competent Uncle <a href="http://www.scrumalliance.org/profiles/5066-robin-dymond">Robin Dymond</a> during the expensive 2-day training of the Certified SCRUM Master.  I hope they won't sue me for it :) <br>  - If time remains, I will show with examples what Lean and Kanban are very popular today.  If time does not remain and you like it, I will do the 2nd part.  You may want to leave me a "request", which you would like to listen to in the following parts. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>  <b>And there are examples?</b> <br>  <a href="http://video.google.com/videoplay%3Fdocid%3D-5805613896772803401">Video</a> example of our seminar, Nikita Foresters about OpenGL on iPhone-e. <br>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/pm/50746/">An audio</a> example of our seminar, I talk about ‚ÄúReaxion Teamwork.  How not to get rid of tasks. ‚Äù

      <b>What do I need to do?</b> <br>  Go here on this <a href="https://www1.gotomeeting.com/register/201299792"><b>link</b></a> .  Enter your name, mail, position and company where you work out.  Send me a request.  You will receive a letter with instructions.  You will need to download a small plugin.  At the appointed time, run the link. <br><br>  <b>Places will be?</b> <br>  I have a (yet) trial account in GoToWebinar, the number of places, as far as I understood, is not very much. <br><br>  <b>And the office can be?</b> <br>  In the office you can.  But for this you need to be in Minsk.  Given the number of people, there are few places in the meeting.  But on the other hand, it will be possible to see the workshop live, and unlike webinars, it will actively participate in the discussion.  Email me at dva@reaxion.com if you want to come. <br><br>  <b>What else do you need to know?</b> <br>  We will practice in something, you need to have paper and a pen with you. <br><br>  <b>And the lecturer is not a camel?</b>  <b>Who is he at all?</b> <br>  Denis Voikhansky.  Executive Producer 2 years, the head of the Minsk office and "playing" PM the last 6 years.  Mobile Gamedev.  Mostly own products, slightly customized.  Experience in small and medium-sized projects, distributed projects.  27 years old, graduated from BSU-FPMI, mathematician, former programmer.  A boxer yogi who does not eat meat and is looking forward to the start of the new F1 season.  Writes a <a href="http://users.livejournal.com/_dva_/">blog</a> . <br><br>  <b>Not exactly a camel?</b>  <b>Experience of public speaking at the lecturer have?</b> <b><br></b>  Experience is.  Lectures at SEF 2009, KRI 2009, 2008, 2007, 2006. <br><br>  <b>Audio or video recording will be?</b> <br>  I think no.  I am creating motivation for you in this way :).  This is also an experiment. <br><br>  <b>And what is the truth of a free webinar?</b> <br>  True. <br><br>  <b>Is there a client for poppy for webinar?</b> <br>  There is. <br><br>  <b>Webinar is what?</b> <br>  This is a web-seminar. <br><br>  <b>Why is this a lecturer?</b> <br>  First of all, I develop my team.  I presume that what is useful about management needs to be known to specific people of my team.  If after the seminars you want to work with me, you know, this is a side effect, we are staffed and we will open vacancies only for cool people. <br><br>  If I can tell something useful to outside people, I will only be glad. <br><br>  It seems to me that the fact that our people do not study, that there is no one from whom to learn, is one of the key problems of our industry. <br><br>  - Do not scold much if you think that it was necessary to post to another newsletter.  Better tell me where you think you need to post. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/83518/">https://habr.com/ru/post/83518/</a></p>
