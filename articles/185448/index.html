  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Intel applications for Android. Informational resources</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img align="left" src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/56e/ecc/246/56eecc246a6e13c07207b5a64d0af024.jpg">  In our blog, we try to reflect all aspects of the versatile activities of Intel, and we generally succeed.  However, one topic - Intel applications created for the Android platform, almost all the time eluded our attention, which is certainly wrong.  Correcting our mistake, we immediately launch a series of posts on this issue, dividing all applications into topics;  The first post will be devoted to information and reference programs. <br>  Of course, all Intel applications for Android, unlike the processors of our company, are completely free. <br><br>  As a test platform, the Orange AZ210A communicator on the Intel Atom processor will be used. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  Intel ARK </h4><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/1cb/32e/48e/1cb32e48e46c7a5694d10b3fef77f52b.jpg"><br>  The mobile equivalent of the well-known <a href="http://ark.intel.com/">Automated Relational Knowledge Base (ARK)</a> well-known knowledge base, containing information about Intel hardware solutions with search and comparison functionality.  It has an automatic update mechanism, at the same time it is an independent offline application that does not require access to the Internet.  Seen features: when scrolling fast, it ‚Äúeats‚Äù pages; if you look through the list, turn it slower. <br><br><h4>  Intel Channel Products Guide </h4><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/999/c76/27c/999c7627ce02bfeb4836ea820c1e8a2d.jpg"><br>  Intel's hardware catalog contains information about boxed versions of processors for PCs, motherboards, and SSD disks, as well as instructions for their installation.  It has the ability to select equipment suppliers in accordance with your location, and this functionality in Russia works correctly.  Unfortunately, in operation, he showed himself not in the best way - he is prone to flying out (or rather, rather, not starting).

    <h4>  Intel VIP Tech Zone </h4><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/ce9/4b9/d3d/ce94b9d3db1f89efb926e915e19a3c1e.jpg"><br>  Under this loud name appears a web application for gamers.  Their attention is invited to the news feed, reports on events, promotions with sweepstakes and prizes from Intel.  VIP Tech Zone members can get privileged access to game events sponsored by the company.  I, frankly, not a big fan of games, but noted the beautiful design of the application and a large amount of material contained in it. <br><br><h4>  Jobs at intel </h4><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/9bc/0a3/af3/9bc0a3af35de83d329eb6c39477a4764.jpg"><br>  Well, here, as they say, everything is clear - the vacancy section is perhaps one of the most visited on the Intel site.  With a proprietary application, searching for interesting offers is even easier, since there is an opportunity to save search history and its results.  Well, the search itself can be carried out in the direction of activity, and by geographical location.  Definitely a useful application for studying the labor market. <br><br><h4>  Intel Software Adrenaline </h4><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/34b/715/11c/34b71511c96719b1cd3666cca1bd7f66.jpg"><br>  Information web application for software developers.  Includes news feed, articles, reviews, and tools for professional communication.  In the area of ‚Äã‚Äãinterest of the portal - graphic technologies, including mobile, cloud solutions and much more.  Naturally, a lot of attention is paid to Intel products. <br><br><h4>  Intel Capital </h4><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/004/939/488/004939488120ea8ddb9b55435a708cde.jpg"><br>  Intel Corporation is not only the largest development and production center, but also an investor who invests huge amounts of money in promising innovative projects.  The Intel Capital application is a directory of startups and companies in which Intel has invested;  <b>through it, you can also contact the company's experts on the financing of their own projects and study Intel‚Äôs policies in this area</b> . <br><br><h4>  Intel Free Press </h4><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/217/ec0/b7b/217ec0b7bfbe66d847c18182742f71ae.jpg"><br>  Android version of the <a href="http://www.intelfreepress.com/">Intel Free Press</a> web portal, a well-known online publication that talks about digital technologies and everything that happens around them.  IFP considers its task to highlight the internal creative processes taking place in Intel and the industry as a whole - how the way from an idea to its realization looks.  As the name suggests, all materials on this site are free to use. <br><br><h4>  Intel Processor Advisor (AG Communications Group) </h4><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/6c6/7c0/b3b/6c67c0b3bb915e7bca4a698bce990729.jpg"><br>  And finally - an application that is not owned by Intel, but closely related to its products.  Intel Processor Advisor is an extremely flexible and customizable catalog of Intel processors.  A graphical representation of the values, various sorting options, an advanced system of filters and search - all this facilitates the search for the optimal processor for each specific task. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/185448/">https://habr.com/ru/post/185448/</a></p>
