  <section class="page js-page"><h1>A few words about the great and mighty.</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Long ago, in a distant galaxy, I did not decide to differ from everyone and went to school just in case. <br>  In the first grade, the hardest language was Ukrainian.  I do not know why.  Then, of course, I settled in and everything was fine.  I remembered a lesson in which words were dictated, and we wrote them down in notebooks.  I did not know what the word "coma" means.  Therefore, between the rest of the words, he also carefully wrote it (of course, placing commas).  And the teacher did not approve of my diligence. <br>  In the older classes, I asked uncertainly a question to my mother: ‚ÄúWhy do I need to know what the subject and predicate is, the complement and something else there?‚Äù  Then he confidently stated: ‚ÄúI will be the director of a large company, I don‚Äôt need this knowledge!‚Äù.  Mom grinned and said that all the people who did not ask stupid questions and diligently taught why the subject and the predicate were needed would necessarily become the directors of large firms.  But I still did not understand the connection. <br>  My talk is about literacy. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  If I can write a dictation or an essay, I‚Äôm not sure that I will write it at 12. I can make grammatical mistakes, I can put a comma in the wrong place.  But I'm sure that below nine (well, or a solid four in the old fret) I will not get. <br>  I was surprised at mom's answer, but I still tried to learn the rules.  And I read a lot of books.  Loved fiction. <br>  Very frustrating spelling of modern youth.  Why?  They do not want to learn, do not want to read books.  Of course, hanging around on VKontakte is much more interesting than these boring rules and books.  Only here the sense of this no, even more, it gets worse.  We have a line-up, some ‚ÄúTravian‚Äù and a bunch of other online games where the same literacy people sit.  No one will correct. <br>  From there did these strange words "ATP", "nz", "mb", "xs" and still any rubbish go?  I do not argue, is short.  - sister.  tal.  But think for a moment what it means, the word ‚Äúthank you,‚Äù ‚Äúnot for that,‚Äù and other incomprehensible words that these adults always imposed on us.  These words show your respect and attitude towards the other person.  No "ATP" and "nz" will not replace the real words.  This is so, the abandoned sounds to the interlocutor untied.  And yes, in fact it is.  Is it really difficult to type the word ‚Äúthank you‚Äù to pay respect?  Yes, there are more letters, but time is not so precious as to save it.  Personally, I do not count ATP as a thank you.  Never.  It‚Äôs better not to respond at all with gratitude than to write one. <br>  I am sure that the spelling of such words and all the ‚ÄúAlbany‚Äù ones there force the fathers of literature to gain momentum in the coffins no worse than an aviation propeller. <br>  I hate to write such words: ‚Äúinet‚Äù, ‚Äúweb‚Äù, ‚Äúproject‚Äù.  I do not know why.  But they look awful.  The letter "e" is written there. <br>  Why don't we want to read books?  Did they begin to write badly?  Not one VKontakte will replace the pleasure of reading a book, while eating apples, tomatoes or raw potatoes.  You can climb a tree, sit in the toilet, lying on the ceiling, and all this with a book.  It's great!  And you become more intelligent.  Do you know how I read books?  I completely reproduce in front of me the whole picture of the plot, I seem to speak in the voices of the characters.  Sometimes, I notice that I can repeat some phrase out loud several times until I get satisfaction from intonation.  While I am reading a book, I live in its world, I breathe that atmosphere, I fly, I travel, I swim.  I'm funny, I'm sad.  And do not believe how exciting it is! <br>  <i>PS It is absolutely violet for me, how will this post affect my karma?</i>  <i>You just need to remember and be proud of the most valuable thing we have - our great and mighty one.</i> </div>
