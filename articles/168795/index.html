We had the opportunity to open the Meizu MX2 and figure out what and how it is inside.  In this material, you will find a phased disassembly process, from removing the cover and metal casing to removing the protective panels from the main board, as well as a description of the components, so that you can get a general idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe "insides" of Meizu MX2. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/821/6c9/3f2/8216c93f21c99c7cb8427be7b2ccd0f7.jpg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  The form and method of mounting the battery cover Meizu MX2 is almost a complete copy of the cover in the Meizu MX.  It is fixed on the case with the help of the bracket, which is located on the left edge of the device, if you look at it, putting the screen down.  As in the original Meizu MX, the lid is secure, but you cannot call it user-friendly.  Remove the cover without knowing how to do it - it is not necessary, it is better to first look at the illustrations from the mini-instructions that comes with your smartphone.  Using a plastic tool resembling a mediator, you need to push the bracket and take the corner of the lid from it, and then simply hold the mediator along the corner along the end and edge so that the lid finally moves away from the case.

Transparent plastic is superimposed on the matte - due to which the cover seems more voluminous.  In the near future there will be replaceable covers of different colors for the Meizu MX2. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/87c/249/d49/87c249d49a0385c174c6000afca9f56f.jpg"><br><br>  The holes for the camera lens are on the lid with a layer of protective transparent plastic, and on the inside there is an LED on a small PCB element with two contacts. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/0a3/0ed/f6f/0a30edf6f0a04b930886952e690f8ca1.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/148/775/388/148775388f1f01e910536b1273ae594d.jpg"><br>  <i>Protective plastic of the camera module and LED flash</i> <br><br>  We turn to the body of the smartphone.  Unlike the original Meizu MX, where the battery and the main L-shaped board were immediately detected behind the removed cover, these elements are hidden by a protective metal casing in the Meizu MX2. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/385/0be/cd1/3850becd1c7f26fa226740e01ae4b888.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/a4f/703/228/a4f7032283ecfd27ea6f2282299fd262.jpg"><br><br>  The casing is mounted on the case with the help of nine screws, and also blocked by a plastic block at the bottom.  To remove the cover, you need to unscrew all the screws and this unit, it, in turn, is also attached to the case with two screws and latches. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/7f3/a32/459/7f3a32459b0461ce7ca097c68826c94a.jpg"><br><br>  Let's see what is in the lower area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe smartphone, inside the plastic block and under it on the case.  If you disassemble the block into two parts (it is composite and the halves are fastened with glue), you can see the external speaker. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/6e8/885/54d/6e888554d104fc911382877cfe385257.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/b1b/4cc/4f2/b1b4cc4f298c5dc3f78d5e832d2d0ea3.jpg"><br><br>  From the outside of the block, the contour of the antenna embedded in plastic and located inside one of the halves of the block is noticeable. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/fa2/e2e/cbe/fa2e2ecbe43644a49142116c58bb26a5.jpg"><br><br>  Under the unit on the case is a small board with a microphone and a microUSB-connector in the center. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/213/60a/b66/21360ab66449890bb19e90c43c066e0c.jpg"><br><br>  Remove the main L-shaped board, after which you can remove this small board from the lower area.  Looking ahead to show what is on its reverse side.  Closer to the center of the board, the sensor of the central and only ‚ÄúHome‚Äù key with a built-in LED, the sensor surface is covered with a thin layer of fluorescent dye, due to this, the ‚ÄúHome‚Äù button in Meizu MX2 glows even when the smartphone is completely off. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/70e/45f/b2c/70e45fb2c35e9b90204cac1a2506d5c2.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/704/0e4/063/7040e4063475a08f8fa7a7f8a87bd5cc.jpg"><br><br>  This is how it looks from the outside of the smartphone, if you look at the ‚ÄúHome‚Äù key. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/728/7a2/ebd/7287a2ebd8727488b92805c905dcb594.jpg"><br><br>  When the plastic block is removed and all screws from the protective cover are twisted, it can be removed.  Access to the battery and the main board. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/821/6c9/3f2/8216c93f21c99c7cb8427be7b2ccd0f7.jpg"><br><br>  The battery is mounted in the compartment with a thin strip of double-sided tape and is connected to the board with a short cable. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/7d7/e53/a2f/7d7e53a2f7ddc5593f91c32f50df8273.jpg"><br><br>  Here you can see the mount key volume. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/e64/ff4/107/e64ff4107c8a931aacfcb2d3a20e76ff.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/545/e4c/e16/545e4ce165c08e5bf42924f4a5fd8598.jpg"><br><br>  The main L-shaped board of the smartphone is covered with protective screens made of aluminum, in addition, there are several rubber covers on the side of the cover. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/74b/b38/4d4/74bb384d472fa5425a47c616d92968cd.jpg"><br><br>  We take out the board from the smartphone and remove the rubber pads from it, they are mounted on a double-sided tape.  To remove protective screens from the board at home, without damaging them or the board itself and the elements on it, it does not seem real, we used special equipment for this. <br>  General view of the board from two sides: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/3b9/716/43e/3b971643e2ef2a97b1b00184e127d7b8.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/560/a1b/9a1/560a1b9a1a2a47562837db86a0d56895.jpg"><br><br>  Let's go through its individual components and chips, starting from the outside of the board (looking towards the battery cover).  SanDisk's 16, 32 or 64 GB production chip is located here, depending on the device version. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/31a/de2/567/31ade25678a9aefe639ef555b19759e2.jpg"><br><br>  The SIMG HD chip barely visible on the motherboard is responsible for implementing the MHL (Mobile High-Definition Link) function.  In the photo, he is immediately under the SanDisk memory chip. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/e56/0a6/807/e560a6807d6404f2c8002a0e9823d38f.jpg"><br><br>  Another important element on this side of the board is the chip, which is responsible for the operation of the camera or, on the other hand, the ISP chip (Image Signal Processor).  In Meizu MX2, as well as in the previous model, ISP-chip Korea MBG048 made by Fujitsu is used.  Not far from it, and the module of the main camera from Sony with the "reverse illumination" of the matrix (BSI) and a resolution of 8 million pixels. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/7b1/e15/442/7b1e154428984e9489c94648375cded5.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/310/743/c40/310743c405f1af3c6de03aa756b81805.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/3fb/4b7/742/3fb4b77428c59671e76454ecd880d143.jpg"><br><br>  To the right of the ISP chip and the hole next to it for the main camera installation is the Broadcom BCM 4430 chip, which is responsible for the operation of Wi-FI and Bluetooth interfaces.  In the image below, this is a black chip to the right of the hole for the camera module. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/e68/b46/e45/e68b46e45450d474eb90037919456a3d.jpg"><br><br>  Above the hole for the camera module is GPS / Glonass Broadcom BCM47511 <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/c4b/090/1cf/c4b0901cf740441f7fbb6f822769ef0a.jpg"><br><br>  <a href="http://www.broadcom.com/products/GPS/GPS-Silicon-Solutions/BCM47511">A brief description of the GPS chip on the manufacturer's website</a> <br><br>  Now look at the other side of the board, the lower area.  Here are two chips - memory (left, bottom) and the radio module (right, top).  The Meizu MX2 uses a radio module Intel XG626 (formerly Infenion), the same is installed in the Samsung Galaxy Nexus.  The same chip is installed in some USB-modems, for example, it is used in the Huawei E369 modem. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/6ae/c54/6b1/6aec546b158e7cea71501042cc299444.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/dcc/32a/8d7/dcc32a8d78bf0303c004b779633ec1f6.jpg"><br><br>  According to the new name system (after the acquisition of Infineon by the giant Intel), the chip is named XMM6260.  Detailed information about it is on the Infineon website <a href="http://www.infineon.com/cms/en/corporate/press/news/releases/2010/INFWLS201002-031.html">here</a> , as well as on the <a href="http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php%3Ft%3D1483053">xda-developers</a> forum. <br><br>  And below are the main features of the chip in a short file from Intel: <br><br> <a href="http://www.intel.com/content/dam/www/public/us/en/documents/platform-briefs/mobile-xmm-260-1-brief.pdf"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/a68/70c/837/a6870c837b4a91bc4fe9bf23db043949.png" width="48" height="48"></a>   <a href="http://www.intel.com/content/dam/www/public/us/en/documents/platform-briefs/mobile-xmm-260-1-brief.pdf">Description of the Intel XMM6260 chip</a> <br><br>  Now turn the board.  Closer to the center there is a dual chip, on top of the LPDDR2 is Samsung's K3PE0E000M XGC2 RAM, from below ‚Äî below ‚Äî the ‚Äúheart of the smartphone‚Äù ‚Äîthe CPU based on the Samsung Exynos 4412 platform, a similar platform used in the Samsung Galaxy Note II.

Below is another interesting element on the board - RFMD RF6260, which is responsible for the operation of 2G / 3G networks.  In the description of the chip on the official website, it goes under the name "Quad-band Multimode Power Amplifier Module for 3G / 4G Mobile Devices" and, accordingly, among the features declared support for networks of the fourth generation LTE. <br><br> <a href="http://www.rfmd.com/CS/Documents/SL_Eurasia%2520RF6260_0109.pdf"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/a68/70c/837/a6870c837b4a91bc4fe9bf23db043949.png" width="48" height="48"></a>   <a href="http://www.rfmd.com/CS/Documents/SL_Eurasia%2520RF6260_0109.pdf">RFMD Chip RF6260 Description</a> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/fb9/429/a49/fb9429a49aea37cf6e88ab78cd9d9044.jpg"><br><br>  In the upper area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe board, just above the memory chip and the Samsung platform, is the ‚Äúpower management‚Äù chip - MAX77686. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/7b0/9e3/c33/7b09e3c339bfc8c7462e753d84cb45b6.jpg"><br><br>  Also here are two audio chips, a voice processor from Audience (AUD eS305) and the main one is WM8958E from Wolfson Microelectronics. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/ff8/ce2/bca/ff8ce2bcadb97bfb3a86574aa46d3710.jpg"><br><br>  Wolfson is known for its portable audio chip.  They are used in some tablets, for example, HP TouchPad and Lenovo ThinkPad Tablet, as well as in many Samsung products: <a href="http://www.wolfsonmicro.com/media_centre/item/wolfson_audio_chip_selected_for_samsung_galaxy_s_iii/">Samsung Galaxy S III</a> smartphones, <a href="http://www.wolfsonmicro.com/media_centre/item/wolfson_supplying_audio_to_samsungs_galaxy_note_10.1_and_note_ii/">Samsung Galaxy Note II</a> and tablets.

Here is a small plastic insert, painted in the color of the metal frame in which it is inscribed.  Insertion is required for better GPS signal transmission. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/0dd/5a5/e58/0dd5a5e58ecb7038af075ec2cee46dbb.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/431/180/b95/431180b959bce291f521c4297543ee04.jpg"><br><br>  Exactly the same plastic insert is inside the case on the metal casing, it is also needed for more efficient operation of the antennas located under the casing. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/83b/148/8dc/83b1488dc75ea02ca6a7762ab239f438.jpg"><br><br>  Just below and to the right of the 3.5 mm headphone jack, you can see a small vibration motor of the smartphone. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/596/fb3/c83/596fb3c83942093c5d22399285c9f09f.jpg"><br><br>  Separately, I want to draw attention to the size of the battery in the Meizu MX2.  The smartphone uses a Li-Pol B020 1800mAh / 6.75Wh battery of small size.  For comparison, there is a battery installed in the Xiaomi Mi-Two - BM20 1930/2000 mFx / 7.1 / 7.4 Wh. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/63a/c48/0c8/63ac480c8d022596ae541ded40bdd5ae.jpg"><br><br>  The body of the smartphone with the main board removed and the other components that can be relatively easily detached looks like this: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/d5e/099/543/d5e09954315c02b1101f9bf9d83a347b.jpg"><br><br>  In conclusion, I would like to dwell on the stainless steel frame that underlies the Meizu MX2 case and provides the necessary rigidity of the structure.  The frame is cut from a single piece of stainless steel (a special piece is taken) and processed. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/945/053/b9a/945053b9afea3a5fd1d19a131e69094b.jpg"><br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">The process of manufacturing a metal frame for the Meizu MX2 from the blank, photo</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a90/016/d46/a90016d467950fe4a8c3e8819d5cd863.jpg" alt="image"></div></div><br>  After processing, part of the frame (middle layer) is polished, we see it, if you look at the middle of any end of the smartphone.  Both extreme planes of the frame are covered with black lacquer, one of these areas is the bezel around the screen, the other remains inside and is not visible if you do not remove the battery cover. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/d34/113/7e6/d341137e6a0010e46319db6ac562ad6a.jpg"><br><br>  Articles about the opening of the Meizu MX2 on Chinese resources: <br><br><ul><li>  <a href="http://mobile.it168.com/tu/1430726.shtml">Meizu MX2 disassembly on mobile.it168.com</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://review.xda.cn/20121206/260_2.html">Meizu MX2 disassembly at review.xda.cn</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://www.gizmochina.com/2012/12/07/meizu-mx2-teardowns-picture/">Translation of an article from review.xda.cn to English</a> </li></ul><br>  Smartphone Meixu MX2 is a quality update of the first model, with a number of improvements, new features and ideas.
