    <h5>  Keyword Selection </h5><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/3b6/a29/eb7/3b6a29eb7688397ab0e4bbe88e9b9917.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  It‚Äôs worth starting with compiling the semantic core, yes, yes, we, like all the country's ‚ÄúSEOs‚Äù, immediately turn to wordstat to understand what words people request more often, for example, ‚Äúcar‚Äù or ‚Äúcar‚Äù <br>  By the way, there are a number of services that allow you to evaluate keywords directly on the App Store and Google Play, but unfortunately the quality of analysis of the Russian sector leaves much to be desired. <br><br><h5>  Optimization keywords and descriptions </h5><br>  Next, we need to determine by which keywords you want to advance, we recommend using the formula <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/edb/0be/a40/edb0bea4023b9473c454bcbf0e2ab0b4.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Where T is search query traffic <br>  Kol - the number of applications for the search query <br>  One should strive for such an indicator Key where, T is maximal, Kol is minimal. <br><br>  Descriptions should be as attractive as possible to the user, because  At the moment, the description for the search in the App Store is not indexed, so it does not follow to devote a lot of time to requests. <br>  In Googe Play, the description plays a key role in indexing here, we recommend that you follow the rules of SEO optimization of readability to the ratio of incoming requests, if you see that your text looks like a sheet of zero times, you can safely rewrite, the inclusion of requests in the text should be as inconspicuous as possible. <br><br><h5>  Optimization of the application name (title) </h5><br>  Often in offices they noisily argue about how to name the application: some experts say that the more original the name, the better (you guessed it who has a marketing degree).  The other half shouts that not using keywords in the title is real blasphemy and nothing shines for the application.  But here, as they say, it‚Äôs not worth hitting the extremes.  Try to combine both the unique name and the entry of keys, for example, ‚ÄúWake up alarm‚Äù <br><br><h5>  Visual design of the application </h5><br>  Imagine the behavior of the user: enter the query of interest in the search, among the mass of applications we pay attention to the top of the list, and here we are already looking at how original and beautiful the icon is! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/2aa/cb2/1de/2aacb21dea651b056625cf99b509ba47.png" alt="image"><br><br>  We go into the application itself, we look at the screenshots, assessment, and necessarily reviews. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/88a/fe3/11d/88afe311df98a7dfe3c27ce68e802839.png" alt="image"><br><br>  What can we learn from this?  Be sure to draw attention to what screenshots you publish; the first screenshot should always be as informative as possible. <br><br>  It is desirable to place not just the screenshots of the application, but also add <br>  short explanations, highlighting the key features of the application. <br>  - Highlight 4-5 main benefits that you want to emphasize; <br>  - Take screenshots demonstrating these benefits; <br>  - Add a description of these advantageous screenshots; <br>  - In the App Store, the first screenshot is especially important - when searching, only the user is first shown to the user.  Therefore, it is important to bring the most important advantages to the first screenshot. <br><br><h5>  Application Indicators </h5><br>  Currently, applications are ranked according to the following indicators: <br>  The number of downloads of your application directly affects the position that it will occupy in the TOPs.  It should be borne in mind that on Google Play is the number of downloads for the entire period, and in the App Store - only for the last week. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/6e0/680/844/6e068084439e2e5627efdf6b2a579952.png" alt="image"><br><br>  The rating of the application cannot be underestimated: even if your application will have a lot of downloads, but without a positive rating you will not be in the TOP. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d65/da9/fab/d65da9fab5f1a8069870d5baf95bb39f.png" alt="image"><br><br><h5>  Reviews </h5><br>  Positive reviews, as well as the number of downloads, greatly affect the position.  The more positive feedback from your application, the more popular it is among users.  And remember: there are no bad reviews!  If your application looks whiter than white, this causes an effect of distrust.  Try to ensure that positive reviews prevail, but do not force out negative ones. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/178/5e0/084/1785e0084b7e6897c3442a651852f21d.png" alt="image"><br><br>  To attract users to write reviews, you can use the service <a href="http://top4app.com/">top4app.com</a> . <br><br>  In the next article we will discuss in more detail how to advertise your application, but for now we wish you good luck in your promotion. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/219607/">https://habr.com/ru/post/219607/</a></p>
