  <section class="page js-page"><h1>TechDays.ru: 200 free online reports or why we did it</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  About a week ago, Habr√© already <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/microsoft/52187/">told</a> that we launched a new version of the site <a href="http://www.techdays.ru/">TechDays.ru</a> .  I would like to explain in more detail why we are doing this project, how it can help you, and also to highlight some controversial points noticed by the community.  Before going to the main part of the message I want to note that all content is <b>ABSOLUTELY FREE</b> and will remain so. <br>  The whole post is divided into parts about the content, design and functionality, so you can safely flip down to the fragment you are interested in.  Perhaps I'll start with the most important thing, with the content <br><br>  <b>Content</b> : <br>  - We have added more than 80 new reports telling about <a href="http://www.techdays.ru/Category.aspx%3FType%3D1">Application Development</a> and <a href="http://www.techdays.ru/Category.aspx%3FType%3D0">IT Infrastructure Management</a> <br>  - We have created the <a href="http://www.techdays.ru/Category.aspx%3FType%3D2">Ready solutions</a> section, in which we offer ready-made manuals and tools for solving work tasks, which you can use in your activity the next day. <br>  - Added <a href="http://www.techdays.ru/Category.aspx%3FTag%3DWindows%2B7">reports on Windows 7</a> (in the near future we expect replenishment) <br>  - Added <a href="http://www.techdays.ru/Category.aspx%3FTag%3DInternet%2BExplorer%2B8">IE8 development reports</a> <br>  - Added report on ISA Server successor - <a href="http://www.techdays.ru/videos/1060.html">Forefront TMG</a> <br>  Continued under the cut: <a name="habracut"></a><br><img src="http://pic.ipicture.ru/uploads/090227/RWHROi7KmN.png"><br>  <b>Design + usability</b> : <br>  When I talked about the launch of the first version of the project in September 2008, I received quite a lot of negative feedback from you.  I admit, many of them were fair, design and usability were clearly limping.  That is why one of the main tasks when launching an updated version of the site we gave design.  So, what we did: <br>  - Made the design modern and beautifully displayed by all browsers <br>  - On the page of the report they gave the central place to the player (see the screenshot below) <br>  - Grouped all materials related to the report, next to the player.  Now you can easily find the file to download to your iPhone :) <br>  - Added a tag cloud to simplify navigation (and there is a tag cloud for all audiences, as well as separate ones for application development and infrastructure management) <br>  - Made explanatory pictures for those who do not have Silverlight installed <br>  - Added filters to categories to simplify the search for the desired content. <br><img src="http://pic.ipicture.ru/uploads/090227/aiSfReRTwm.png"><br><br>  <b>Functional</b> : <br>  The question of functionality was also not the last in the list of works that were carried out before launch.  What is new? <br>  - One of the main innovations: the <b>ability to insert a video of any report to your blog</b> or website.  To do this, you need to <a href="http://www.techdays.ru/Registration.aspx">register</a> on the site and go to the page of the report of interest.  To the right of the player under the voting block for the report you will find the link Code for insertion into the blog, clicking on which you will receive the code on the iframe, which later can be placed on the website / blog <br>  - We made readable URLs.  Hooray :) You no longer need to memorize unrealistic links, now they look like this: <a href="http://www.techdays.ru/videos/1237.html">http://www.techdays.ru/videos/1237.html</a> <br>  - The Selected Reports page has appeared.  After registration, you will be able to add interesting reports for you on the site and then quickly access them. <br>  - In each category, the opportunity to subscribe to the RSS feed updates.  In general, now almost any update in any category / report can be subscribed through the RCC

      <b>Frequently asked questions</b> .  I will try to give answers to them, because  Often these things cause difficulties when working with the site: <br>  - To view all the videos you need the Microsoft Silverlight player, you can download it <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/silverlight/resources/install.aspx">here</a> .  (free).  It is installed on MACs :) For installation on Linux, FreeBSD, <a href="http://mono-project.com/MoonlightSupportedPlatforms">see this page</a> . <br>  - If you do not want to install Silverlight, then just download the files you are interested in: WMV, Podcast (mp3), video for iPhone / iPod (m4v) <br>  - Silverlight works on the latest versions of the Opera browser <br>  - Live.ID and Open.ID are only authorization systems, that is, when you first enter the site, you will be asked to fill in a SHORT registration form (minimum fields).  In the future, you can easily log in to Live.ID and Open.ID and forget about the login / password on the site <br><br>  I think I talked in some detail about the possibilities and changes of the site.  In conclusion, I would like to say that in the near future there will be new reports and useful functionality on the site, which I will definitely tell you about. <br><br>  In the meantime, <b>I would like to ask you to share comments</b> about the site / content.  What can we do / change / improve to make it easier for you? </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/53049/">https://habr.com/ru/post/53049/</a></p>
