Part 2 - legal support</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Sooner or later, an entrepreneur will need the help of an intelligent lawyer who will give advice and prepare beautiful documents for a deal.  Solving a legal problem is a dime a dozen.  In order to better understand the market in which <a href="http://knopka.com/">our company</a> operates, we conducted a small study: we introduced the variety of accounting services in the <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/knopka/blog/218651/">previous article</a> , postpone the proposals of secretaries and <nobr>business assistants</nobr> to the next one, and today tell you what to do when a business stumbles about legal issues . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/4ce/79f/e0f/4ce79fe0f976d9f5d78a0fcf90dae71c.png"><br><br>  The legal services market in Moscow is similar to what accounting offers.  You can easily find a couple of <nobr>web services</nobr> , a bunch of <nobr>reference and legal</nobr> systems, get a one-time consultation, hundreds of outsourcing companies will take care of everything, and there is no shortage in staff resumes and remote employees.  Our goal is to choose an option that is suitable for the price and level of service ranging from micro to medium-sized businesses. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  <nobr>Reference</nobr> systems </h4><br>  Sophisticated habrayuser easily find the answer to any question, saddling Google or Yandex, but you will have to deal with conflicting information from disparate sources.  Even before the advent of popular search engines, there were <nobr>reference and legal</nobr> systems for searching legal information.  Many of them survived the millennium, reached our days, prettier in some places, and sometimes remind of those immemorial times when sharp-nosed shoes still tread the ground and tinted gelenwagen of people in crimson jackets - the forerunners of modern Russian business.

      The undoubted advantages of such systems over the usual search engines: accuracy, completeness and constant updating of data, the abundance of author comments that translate information from the bird's language into Russian.  In addition to legislative articles (including archival articles), legal acts, judicial practices, these systems contain typical forms and templates for legal documents. <br><br>  Some of the information is available to everyone, but if you want to get an interpretation of the laws, extended reference books, legal advice and assistance in solving legal issues, you will have to share with developers a couple (or a couple dozen) thousand rubles.  With the help of some ATP, you can order the preparation of documents.  Most of these systems are installed locally, but those that keep up with the times work in the browser and even release mobile applications. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/15d/a41/41e/15da4141e94a37df3cb16b95388a4c6a.png"><br><br><h6>  To suit </h6>  In the hands of an intelligent lawyer, they will become an effective tool for navigation in the turbulent waters of the legal ocean, while an entrepreneur will be helped to independently understand uncomplicated situations, but they are unlikely to contribute to solving a serious problem, not to mention predicting and preventing it. <br><br><h6>  How much is </h6>  500‚Äì10 000 rubles per month (depending on the number of users and legal modules, it can cost more), some of the information is available for free, but the upper limit of the subscription fee is loose <nobr>somewhere</nobr> in the dense layers of the atmosphere. <br><br><h6>  Links </h6>  <a href="http://www.consultant.ru/">Consultant Plus</a> , <a href="http://www.garant.ru/">Guarantor</a> , <a href="http://www.kontur-normativ.ru/"><nobr>Kontur-Normative</nobr></a> , <a href="http://www.referent.ru/">Referent</a> , <a href="http://www.kodeks.ru/">Code</a> . <br><br><h4>  <nobr>Online</nobr> legal <nobr>exchanges</nobr> </h4><br>  Systematic attempts to independently understand all the peripetia of the legislation are fraught with migraines and dysfunction of the digestive system, and the content of a specially trained person in the state can lead to depletion of the wallet.  In this situation, the beginning entrepreneur will come to the exchange of lawyers, where you can quickly and inexpensively get an answer to almost any question. <br><br>  The most interesting solution in this category is <a href="http://pravoved.ru/">Pravoved.RU</a> .  Most of all, it looks like a kind of Stackoverflow: you can search for an answer among a heap of previously created topics, or immediately ask the community of professional lawyers.  However, lawyers, unlike IT specialists, do not want to share their competencies on a voluntary basis, so each question must be backed up with a monetary rate.  Sensing the sound of coins, knowledgeable people will run into the comments, they will give a little jolt, come to a consensus and give an answer.  You will need to choose one or several people who will get your money. <br><br>  The service team checks the lawyers, constantly improves the ranking mechanisms, monitors the answers and returns the money if the answer was incorrect or incomplete.  For a fee, you can talk with a live lawyer by phone (which is especially useful when you do not want to make your case publicly censured), and also order the preparation of documents (contracts, powers of attorney, claims). <br><br>  The <a href="http://www.liveexpert.ru/expert/law">liveexpert.ru</a> service <a href="http://www.liveexpert.ru/expert/law">is</a> similar to a lawyer on the principle of work, but does not specialize in legal matters, therefore it is unlikely to provide a similar level of advice. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/90c/6e6/c1d/90c6e6c1d0f93fa7c2678f4c7904799c.png"><br><br><h6>  To suit </h6>  For individuals and aspiring entrepreneurs.  Lawyers will not be immersed in the specifics of the business, but this is not required when solving typical issues of small business. <br><br><h6>  How much is </h6><ul><li>  100‚Äì1,000 rubles per question; </li><li>  400‚Äì1 500 for talking on the phone; </li><li>  400‚Äì2 500 per document preparation. </li></ul><br><h6>  Links </h6>  <a href="http://pravoved.ru/">Pravoved.RU</a> , <a href="http://www.liveexpert.ru/expert/law">LiveExpert</a> . <br><br><h4>  Disposable Services </h4><br>  A slightly more intimate approach for relatively little money can be obtained by using one-time services of law firms or <nobr>freelance lawyers</nobr> .  You will not have to search for a long time: Moscow law firms are fighting to the death for positions in the search results, and the addresses of portals for searching for civilian specialists are already well known to every habrovchanin. <br><br>  If we did not have our own lawyers, we would prefer to apply to a law firm.  Competent people work in such offices, whose competence has been confirmed at least during the interview when applying for a job, and this is already more than what a freelancer can boast :) <br><br>  To the same category, conditionally, we refer the <nobr>company-registrars</nobr> , whose ads (among other exciting works of folk art) are generously plastered with all free advertising space (posts and fences).  These highly specialized offices will prepare documents for registering a company with any <nobr>economic and legal</nobr> form (IP, LLC, CJSC, JSC), or even take up the whole process, including going to the tax and Pension Fund, printing and opening a bank account . <br><br>  It is possible to prepare documents for registration independently, using <nobr>web services</nobr> like <a href="http://www.b-kontur.ru/start/">Elba</a> or <a href="http://www.moedelo.org/">My Business</a> , but if you want to spend your time on more pleasant and useful things, it is better to immediately turn to professionals.  Moscow, to put it mildly, does not feel a lack of <nobr>registrar firms</nobr> .  Selecting the best among them is not an easy task (after all, Button does not provide such services :), but we cooperate with <a href="http://www.reg-express.ru/">Express Registrar</a> and, at least, are convinced of its reliability. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/3c2/439/be3/3c2439be32faa733e3cdb32a08640d69.jpg"><br><br><h6>  To suit </h6>  Anyone who needs a one-time consultation, preparing a package of documents and those who are just about to register their business.  In addition, you can test a law firm once before entrusting your business to it for months and years :) <br><br><h6>  How much is </h6><ul><li>  1,000-5,000 for oral or written consultation; </li><li>  2,000‚Äì10,000 per document preparation; </li><li>  500‚Äì1 500 rubles per hour of freelancer work or 2 000‚Äì5 000 per project; </li><li>  5 000‚Äì15 000 for registering a business. </li></ul><br><h6>  Links </h6>  <a href="https://www.google.ru/search%3Fq%3D%25D1%258E%25D1%2580%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B8%25D1%2587%25D0%25B5%25D1%2581%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B0%25D1%258F%2B%25D0%25BA%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BD%25D1%2581%25D1%2583%25D0%25BB%25D1%258C%25D1%2582%25D0%25B0%25D1%2586%25D0%25B8%25D1%258F">Thousands of law firms</a> , <a href="https://www.fl.ru/search/%3Fsearch_string%3D%25FE%25F0%25E8%25E4%25E8%25F7%25E5%25F1%25EA%25E0%25FF%2B%25EA%25EE%25ED%25F1%25F3%25EB%25FC%25F2%25E0%25F6%25E8%25FF%26action%3Dsearch">crowds of freelancers</a> . <br><br><h4>  Legal support (outsourcing) </h4><br>  If questions of a legal nature arise constantly, one-time consultations can cost a pretty penny.  As in the case of accounting, you can get full support without inflating your own staff.  The same ‚Äúone-time‚Äù law firms will gladly take on serving a business of any size on an ongoing basis.  At the same time, the quality of service will be quite high, since law firms of various specializations work in such firms, who exchange experience and solve a wide range of issues. <br><br>  In addition to advice and consultation, law firms will undertake the preparation and analysis of documents, transaction support, pre-trial settlement, participation in negotiations, representation of interests in government bodies and even in court.  The cost of service is usually included a certain number of hours (10 and more), and additional time is charged separately.  The circle of duties that the law firm will undertake also depends on the amount of money the entrepreneur is willing to part with, which makes it difficult to determine the final cost. <br><br>  By the way, some accounting companies described in the previous article have their own lawyer in the staff, which will be enough to resolve not the most difficult issues.  This remark will help rather when choosing a bukhkompanii :) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f9c/4cd/ca4/f9c4cdca4cc2f1b5dbea00f3e8ef9695.png"><br><br><h6>  To suit </h6>  Everyone who has to deal with legal issues all the time often needs to check and create contracts and other documents, analyze the activities of their company, as well as those who don‚Äôt want to fall under the sword of the goddess of justice <nobr>due to</nobr> minor mistakes made by inattention. <br><br><h6>  How much is </h6><ul><li>  15 000‚Äì50 000 per month; </li><li>  in some cases, the price tag can go up to 150,000, if not to infinity; </li><li>  1,000‚Äì3,000 per hour with hourly rates. </li></ul><br><h6>  Links </h6>  <a href="http://www.ulc.ru/">United Lawyers</a> , <a href="http://www.korpusprava.ru/">Law Corps</a> , <a href="http://simple-ways.ru/">Simple Ways</a> and <a href="https://www.google.ru/search%3Fq%3D%25D1%258E%25D1%2580%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B8%25D1%2587%25D0%25B5%25D1%2581%25D0%25BA%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B5%2B%25D1%2581%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BF%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B6%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B5%2B%25D0%25B1%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B7%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B5%25D1%2581%25D0%25B0%2B%25D0%25B2%2B%25D0%25BC%25D0%25BE%25D1%2581%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B5">thousands</a> more <a href="https://www.google.ru/search%3Fq%3D%25D1%258E%25D1%2580%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B8%25D1%2587%25D0%25B5%25D1%2581%25D0%25BA%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B5%2B%25D1%2581%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BF%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B6%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B5%2B%25D0%25B1%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B7%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B5%25D1%2581%25D0%25B0%2B%25D0%25B2%2B%25D0%25BC%25D0%25BE%25D1%2581%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B5">law firms</a> . <br><br><h4>  Remote lawyer </h4><br>  If the fashionable word ‚Äúoutsourcing‚Äù causes heartburn, and you don‚Äôt want to take an employee to the state and buy him a comfortable chair, you can go to one of the hunting portals and find yourself a remote lawyer.  In this case, you can considerably save money by finding a person with a legal education from a conditional Uryupinsk (if you are not afraid of geographical distance and a funny Uryupa accent). <br><br>  As in the case of an accountant, it is important to find a reliable and hardworking person with positive recommendations from friends or acquaintances entrepreneurs.  Otherwise, you will have to enter into an unequal battle, opposing your legal <nobr>kung-fu to the</nobr> masterful style of the inveterate professional, or even work on parole, paying salaries to bitcoins :) <br><br>  In addition, a lawyer is a person who provides services of a very intimate nature.  The entrepreneur reveals his <nobr>business secrets to him</nobr> , so the level of trust should not be lower than to <nobr>the venereologist</nobr> or holy father, who takes the confession. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/041/391/5a2/0413915a2345306f619b1c5bc6adc0c8.jpg"><br><br><h6>  To suit </h6>  It is a bit cheaper than a law firm, and this is perhaps the only constructive argument in favor of a remote lawyer.  You can talk about such things as emotional contact and personal responsibility, but then you need not just a mercenary, but a friend (or at least a friend of a friend) a lawyer. <br><br><h6>  How much is </h6>  10 000‚Äì30 000 rubles per month <br><br><h6>  Links </h6>  <a href="http://hh.ru/resumesearch/result%3Fa%3D1%26from%3DCLUSTER_SCHEDULE%26text%3D%25D1%2583%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BD%25D1%258B%25D0%25B9%2B%25D1%258E%25D1%2580%25D0%25B8%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%26pos%3Dfull_text%26profArea%3D23%26logic%3Dnormal%26schedule%3D3">HeadHunter</a> , <a href="http://www.superjob.ru/resume/search_resume.html%3Fsbmit%3D1%26show_refused%3D0%26keywords%255B0%255D%255Bkeys%255D%3D%25D1%2583%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BD%25D1%258B%25D0%25B9%2B%25D1%258E%25D1%2580%25D0%25B8%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%26keywords%255B0%255D%255Bsrws%255D%3D7%26keywords%255B0%255D%255Bskwc%255D%3Dand%26t%255B0%255D%3D4%26t%255B1%255D%3D33%26order_by%255Brank%255D%3Ddesc%26search_hesh%3D264429042021826%26main%3D1%26catalogues%3D100%26detail_search%3D1%26strict_place_of_work%3D1%26place_of_work%3D2">SuperJob</a> . <br><br><h4>  Lawyer in the state </h4><br>  A full-time lawyer or even a small legal department will close 80% of issues related to corporate law.  The remaining 20% ‚Äã‚Äãare unlikely to <nobr>ever</nobr> meet on the path of an entrepreneur, but even in this case, he will at least not be left all alone in the face of justice.  If you place a full-time lawyer in one office with a no less full-time accountant (as we do in the Button), then together they will be able to more effectively resolve issues at the junction of accounting and jurisprudence. <br><br>  In addition to other charms, a staff lawyer defeats other options due to bright tactile sensations, direct visual contact and the deepest immersion in the business of the employer.  You should not expect that a lawyer who specializes in corporate law will help you with a divorce or a criminal act, but he will not refuse the friendly advice.  Narrow specialization is the only, but rather noticeable lack of a full-time lawyer.  You need to understand in advance what tasks the lawyer in your company should solve, and make a choice based on this, or hire a whole department right away. <br><br>  We constantly hire lawyers, so easily give a couple of tips, if you ask in the comments. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/999/bd9/d7d/999bd9d7d2164247801674330982df87.jpg"><br><br><h6>  To suit </h6>  As in the case with a staff accountant, it will provide an unattainable level of service for other categories to anyone who has enough money in the bins for paying salaries and arranging a workplace.

On the one hand, we have many lawyers, and we fully fit the description of a law firm.  On the other hand, Clients Buttons do not communicate with an abstract law firm, but with a completely animated person whom they know by name.  This person monitors all customer transactions to solve a problem before it even occurs. <br><br>  Our lawyers work in a team with an accountant, solving issues at the junction of two professional fields.  We try to hire diverse lawyers to help each other, share experiences, broaden their horizons and answer different questions.  Moreover, lawyers love their professional slang very much, so we constantly use force (love and unlimited happiness) so that they communicate in simple and understandable language :) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/326/ab9/93a/326ab993afc25300a89bc6029f41b0a9.png"><br><br><h6>  To suit </h6>  Our horse is corporate and contract law, foreign economic activity and everything related to legal business.

This cost includes not only the button lawyer, but the whole team - an accountant, a lawyer, a business assistant and a <a href="http://bank24.ru/">bank</a> with the most round-the-clock operational day in Russia. <br><br><h6>  Link </h6>  <a href="http://knopka.com/">knopka.com</a> <br><br>  If you are still thinking about whom to entrust your accounting, we recommend reading the <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/knopka/blog/218651/">first part of our entertaining companion</a> , in which we washed the bones of the Moscow market of accounting services. <br><br>  I want to believe that we approached the question as objectively and impartially as possible, but if <nobr>you</nobr> forgot <nobr>something</nobr> or <nobr>were</nobr> mistaken <nobr>somewhere</nobr> , please criticize us in the comments, not hesitate in expressions :) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/220323/">https://habr.com/ru/post/220323/</a></p>
