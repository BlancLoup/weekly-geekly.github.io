  <section class="page js-page"><h1>A digital startup program is just the beginning. Interview with Arkady Moreynis</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Finishes our series of interviews about digital start-ups in Russia, <a href="http://www.facebook.com/amoreynis">Arkady Moreynis</a> , chief director of <a href="http://glavstart.ru/">Glavstart</a> .  Arkady told us about the features of Russian startups, shared his thoughts on the main problems of Russian digital startups and his vision of the future of mobile applications and web projects. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b>WebProfessionals.ru:</b> What, in your opinion, are the main differences between startups in Russian e-commerce and web development from Western ones? <br><br>  <b>Arkady Moreynis:</b> It's hard to say about the difference.  If you look at American startups, many of them are very similar to similar Russian startups.  Those.  on ideas there is no serious difference.  Probably one of the main differences is in the execution, in the implementation of projects.  In the rest of the activity that goes around the project.  Let's not forget that to make a startup is not a program to develop.  Development of the program is 20% of all problems.  Everything else is a set of partners, audience, retention of partners and audience, holding events to get what is called the fashionable word ‚Äúattraction‚Äù, i.e.  get some results in the audience, money, customers, etc.  Therefore, the main difference lies in the fact that in the West, startups understand that the most important thing is attraction, and we still think that the most important thing is to develop a program.  Sometimes you even get letters that say ‚Äúwe have everything, all that remains is to recruit customers and an audience‚Äù - this means that in fact there is nothing. <br><br>  <b>WebProfessionals.ru:</b> Which startups from your practice are the most memorable?  Which have achieved the most significant success, and what is the reason for their success?

      <b>Arkady Moreynis:</b> Success is different.  For example, we have a project for which a contract was recently signed.  This is the project ‚Äú <a href="http://moresalonov.ru/">Sea of ‚Äã‚ÄãSalons</a> ‚Äù - a system of online registration in beauty salons.  He invested <a href="http://www.kupikupon.ru/">CouponCoupon</a> coupon service.  This success is understandable, because these services have a good synergy.  Customers of coupon services often complain that coupon buyers come all at once, as a result of which they have poor loyalty.  Just the service "Sea Salons" allows to solve these problems.  First, clients are recorded for a specific, pre-agreed time.  Secondly, all customer data enters CRM, with the help of which salon owners can manage the loyalty of this audience.  This is the first success. <br><br>  I would like to mention another successful project.  On May 19-20, New York hosted the <a href="http://techcrunch.com/events/disrupt-ny-2012/event-info/">TechCrunch Disrupt NY 2012</a> conference in which our <a href="http://tagbrand.com/">TagBrand</a> project was <a href="http://tagbrand.com/">presented</a> .  And this is a different kind of success.  In my memory, this is the only Russian startup lately that was selected for such an event.  Those.  The project was noticed and evaluated in terms of execution, idea and other parameters at a high international level, as they say, in the Hamburg bill. <br><br>  <b>WebProfessionals.ru:</b> How do you see the vector of development of web startups?  What are the trends and opportunities? <br><br>  <b>Arkady Moreynis: The</b> vector is as follows: start-ups will appear more and more, because the boundaries between the computer and the mobile application are actually quite fragile now.  With the advent of tablets, it is generally not clear what a computer is, what a phone is, what a smartphone is.  Those.  the vector is very simple: everything will be mobilized, everything will be accessible from everywhere, from any device.  If such devices are embedded in refrigerators or microwaves, it will soon be available from them.  In other words, there will be no border between mobile and non-mobile applications. <br><br>  <b>WebProfessionals.ru:</b> Over the past year, web startups in large companies have begun to appear more often (for example, e5 - the Crossroads project, Enter - the Svyaznoy shareholders project).  Should we expect more mass attention to the topic of a new online business? <br><br>  <b>Arkady Moreynis:</b> Of course, because more and more people are starting to use the Internet for shopping, sales, communication, etc.  Therefore, the road and only one of all - on the Internet.  Just big companies, as more cumbersome players, usually begin to follow the trend, i.e.  when the trend is already quite specific and clear. <br><br>  <b>WebProfessionals.ru:</b> Share your experience, what parameter should a startup correspond to in order to reach a return on investment and generate profit in the planned period? <br><br>  <b>Arkady Moreynis:</b> The main problem here is not even to get a return on investment, the main problem is to come to life.  The main problem of startups, which is now, is that they are not able to do something in a short time to test their idea.  And this is the main problem.  Those.  some try to make a quality product for a long time, in the assurance that it will be demanded by users in this very form, but in fact this is almost never the case.  It is necessary to go through iterations, and practically no one knows how. <br><br>  <b>WebProfessionals.ru:</b> Advise our audience sources of startup inspiration and external experience. <br><br>  <b>Arkady Moreynis:</b> Startup inspiration source - real life.  We must be able to solve real problems of real life, and not invented.  Therefore, only real life can serve as a source of inspiration, and not an invented theory that the user will need it. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/147007/">https://habr.com/ru/post/147007/</a></p>
