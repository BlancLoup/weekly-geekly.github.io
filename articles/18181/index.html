  <section class="page js-page"><h1>In search of work for a project manager (Moscow) - Part I</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Influenced by a <a href="http://www.liveinternet.ru/users/rotting_mind/">friend,</a> I decided to start writing about my job searches and interviews.  Just a hunt to express your positive emotions about different people you met during the last 3 weeks. <br><br>  Today is the first part.  <strong>Initial data</strong> : <br>  I lived 7 years in Novosibirsk, and the last 2 years are closely connected with work on the Internet.  He worked in <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/Petra/">Petra</a> as an information project manager for half of 2006, and almost the whole of 2007 (except for the second half of December :) - as a manager at the <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/deepsign/">Internet agency Deepsign</a> . <a name="habracut"></a>  During this time, we have made several nice websites and services (for example, <a href="http://www.sibset.ru/">Siberian Networks</a> and <a href="http://www.kvarsys.ru/maps/kirowa/">Kvarsis' layouts</a> ) - in total, more than 12 projects, in addition, I was promoting websites (search + contextual advertising) - this is about 10 more projects. <br><br>  Education is more than necessary - 3 diplomas, one of them is a specialist (management), an additional qualification (a translator in the field of professional communication) and one master (economic sociology).  There were also 2 completed courses on the specialty Automated Management Systems and a year in graduate school in economics and national economy management - but unfortunately both had to be abandoned.

      At the end of November 2007, due to ‚Äútired of Novosibirsk‚Äù :) I decided to go to Moscow.  The next day he quit his job (+ he worked for 2 weeks and handed over the remaining projects), immediately bought a plane ticket and began to pack up.  I wanted to come and get a client Internet agency and make cool sites for cool clients. <br><br>  Before leaving, I looked through the <a href="http://2007.tagline.ru/%3Faction%3Dshow%26id%3D1448">rating of Internet agencies</a> once more, chose those whom I knew and who admired me, and threw off my resume.  He also added on hh.ru and superjob.ru, although he added with disappointment that he learned that their standard forms are poorly suited for project managers - there is no place to add examples of projects.  Prior to departure, <strong>pre-arranged interviews</strong> with: <br><br><ul><li>  <a href="http://www.u-soft.ru/">U-Soft</a> <br>  <a href="http://www.grape.ru/">Grape</a> <br>  <a href="http://www.defa.ru/">Defa</a> <br>  <a href="http://www.r-style.ru/">R-style</a> <br>  <a href="http://www.shtaty.ru/">Shtaty.ry (agency)</a> <br>  <a href="http://www.bdbd.ru/">Bdbd</a> <br>  For me personally, Grape and Defa were of the greatest interest - these are two awesome online agencies in my opinion.  Interesting were also R-Style with their new project within km.ru.  U-Soft seemed like a dark horse to me, Shtaty.ru is a recruitment agency - which is fraught with both possibilities and difficulties.  It's hard to say something about BDBD - I heard a lot of negative reviews in Novosibirsk about their work on website promotion (but I also know that they occupy a leading position in the market), but I don‚Äôt know anything about the fact that they make websites. <br><br>  I flew from Novosibirsk on December 12 in a positive mood - after all, independence day, although this holiday was canceled.  It was immediately clear that it would have been better to go in January - but it was reluctant to sit in Novosibirsk for a month and just wait a month. <br><br>  PS In the following posts I am going to describe my interviews in these companies and make a rough overview of the vacancies.  If someone from the representatives of these companies thinks that I violate any confidentiality conditions ( <em>about which there was not a word - but nevertheless there is etiquette and tacit agreements with candidates for work</em> ) - please unsubscribe in the comments or me in PM, I just will not write or pre-agree the text with you. </li></ul></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/18181/">https://habr.com/ru/post/18181/</a></p>
