In this case, some data types are easily remembered, others - difficult.  So we can easily remember the word known to us, consisting of a large number of letters, but we face difficulties if the letters do not form a word.  A similar problem arises when memorizing numbers, as this is abstract information. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  Illumine popular ways to memorize numbers: </h4><br><h5>  Method 1: Using Sound Memory: </h5><br><br>  1) A phrase is selected in which the number of letters in each word corresponds to the next digit of the number: <br>  "I know and remember this perfectly, <br>  Pi many signs I lose, in vain " <br>  Accordingly, it stands for 3.14159265358 <br><br>  2) Or in which the numbers themselves rhyme: <br>  "To PI remember, brothers, <br>  It is necessary to repeat more often: <br>  Three, fourteen, fifteen, <br>  Nine, twenty-six and five

      Advantage: it is easy to select words and make sentences from them, as well as to decipher. <br><br>  Disadvantage: when memorizing long numeric combinations <br>  (for example: 7-digit phone number) will have to make long sentences.  Even with a small number of long sentences you can get confused, not to mention large. <br><br><h5>  Method 2: Using Shaped Memory </h5><br>  1) One digit: <br>  The unit is a stake, a piece of wood in bits of bark, rough to the touch.  Two - swan, white and thick, and so on for all numbers. <br><br>  2) Two or more: <br>  After creating a figurative series, memorizing numbers turns into a game similar to drawing a cartoon. <br>  For example, to memorize the number 21, one can imagine a swan, on which a count fell, his bruise and a swan hissing angrily and pinching a stake.  Thus, instead of abstract figures, moving pictures appear in the memory, which are easily and firmly held in it. <br><br>  Advantage: a person's fantasy will always find a figurative comparison for any combination of numbers. <br><br>  Disadvantage: the same as in method 1: when memorizing, for example, a phone, a long ‚Äúcartoon‚Äù is obtained, and if there are several phones, then the pictures from the ‚Äúcartoons‚Äù can be confused with each other. <br><br><h5>  Method 3: Use the phone keypad layout </h5><br>  Numbers are replaced with corresponding letters from the telephone keypad, and words are composed of letters.  For example: Yandex telephone number: 8-800-333-96-39, a text version of the number is suggested for memorization: 8-800-333-YNDX <br><br>  Advantage: the digital series is remembered easier if you replace the parts that are difficult for perception with the letters that form a certain phrase or a word. <br><br>  Disadvantage: the digits 0 and 1 do not have alphabetic values ‚Äã‚Äãin the telephone keypad, so memorizing them with this method does not work, which is a big disadvantage, since these are 1/5 of all existing digits (it‚Äôs about the 10th number system considers most people). <br><br>  And finally ... <br><br><h5>  Method 4: Alphanumeric </h5><br>  Its essence lies in the fact that some letters are assigned to each digit, and words are composed of letters.  There are several such alphabets. <br>  Here is one of them: <br><br>  0. The letters H and L in the word "NoL." <br>  1. P from the word "Raz." <br>  2. D - ‚ÄúTwo‚Äù and G, since this figure most closely resembles this small letter. <br>  3. T from "Three" and 3 - by external similarity. <br>  4. H from the word "Four" (and, by the way, resembles appearance), but more often K from the word "Square". <br>  5. P - ‚ÄúFive‚Äù and B, in terms of sound similarity (and in appearance). <br>  6. W - ‚ÄúSix‚Äù and F, also in terms of similarity of sound. <br>  7. C - ‚ÄúSeven‚Äù, and usually this is enough, since C is a very common letter. <br>  8. B - ‚ÄúEight‚Äù (external similarity is also strong) and, sometimes, similar in sounding F. <br>  9. It's harder here.  You can M from the word "Many", since 9 is the largest figure. <br><br>  For example, the number 3312 can be written as "notebook". <br><br>  Advantage: the small size of the resulting phrases, since several numbers can be encoded in one word.  Ease of decoding (depends on the encoding: there are intuitive, but there are those that need to be learned as a multiplication table). <br><br>  Disadvantage: it is necessary to select words by the resulting letters and sentences by words, and this, sometimes, is difficult.  And also to memorize the ‚Äúencoding‚Äù - correspondence to the numbers of certain letters. <br><br><h5>  Let's summarize the mini-summary: </h5><br>  The most effective way is the alphanumeric alphabet, because when using it, compact phrases are obtained, which reduces the risk of confusing words from different phrases.  Also, a large variety of phrases is achieved thanks to the rich Russian language (more than 200'000 vocabulary units are recorded in the Dahl dictionary). <br><br><h5>  Let's start creativity </h5><br>  It is necessary to create your own alphanumeric encoding, understandable to most people and at the same time, importantly, effective.  There are 20 suitable consonants in Russian.  Vowels are not used because then there will be almost no suitable words.  20 consonants.  10 digits <br><br>  Let there be 2 columns of letters that fit the numbers.  The first is intuitive, the second will compensate for the first in terms of efficiency. <br><br>  First column: <br><br>  0. N from the word "Zero" <br>  1. P from the word "Raz" <br>  2. D - ‚ÄúTwo‚Äù <br>  3. T - ‚ÄúThree‚Äù <br>  4. C - ‚ÄúFour <br>  5. P - ‚ÄúFive‚Äù <br>  6. W - ‚ÄúSix‚Äù <br>  7.  - ‚ÄúSeven‚Äù <br>  8. B - Eight <br>  9. Z - since the letter D is already taken, we use Z, which is similar to 9 in appearance <br><br>  These letters are intuitive. <br><br>  Second: <br><br>  0. F <br>  1. C <br>  2. B <br>  3. Sch <br>  4. To <br>  5. G <br>  6. L <br>  7. F <br>  8. X <br>  9. M <br><br>  Why exactly?  How was this column created? <br>  So, for each letter of the first column, a pair was chosen so that the arithmetic average of the sum of the frequency of their use in Russian was approximately equal to the rest of the arithmetic average.  This will increase the variability of possible words. <br><br>  Let's call it OTsBK - Optimum Digital-Letter Coding. <br>  Now, for example, you can convert the number 412 to the word "turn", 86-79 to "your union" or "the will of the family" and so on.  The inverse transformation is also possible: ‚Äúyellow cardboard‚Äù looks like 763-41-30, ‚Äúinput field‚Äù - 562-68-82. <br><br><h4>  Relevance and scope </h4><br>  Currently, people have become too dependent on electronics, the Internet.  Solving this problem will help reduce our dependence on electronic devices, because we no longer have to write down phone numbers, dates, etc. into electronic memory devices.  It will also increase the effectiveness of training.  For example: students do not have to cram dates, numbers, etc. <br>  This technique can be applied in everyday life - to memorize phone numbers, credit cards, Yandex-money ... In training, to memorize dates, constants and other digital information.  This eliminates the need to have recorded data with you, reduces the risk of losing it, which in turn reduces the risk of attackers using your data. <br><br><h4>  Program </h4><br>  He also wrote a program, which itself selects words by given numbers and converts numbers to words.  The program will be selected words for given numbers.  Numbers separated by '-' are considered separate.  For example: 1234 and 12-34, this is not the same thing.  In the first case, the search will be performed by the combination ‚Äú1234‚Äù, in the second - by the two combinations ‚Äú12‚Äù and ‚Äú34‚Äù. <br><br>  Reference: <a href="http://ifolder.ru/29692040">ifolder.ru/29692040</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/141475/">https://habr.com/ru/post/141475/</a></p>
