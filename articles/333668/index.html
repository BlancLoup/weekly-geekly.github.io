Perhaps this will help others avoid similar mistakes.  A large number of likes and followers in social networks does not guarantee you from cheating.  Deception can be not only in the non-performance of paid works, but also in receiving as a result not original images. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><p>  On June 12, through Twitter, I received a message with a proposal for cooperation: <br></p><br><p>  <i>Are you a designer and social media manager?</i>  <i>Professional Branding and Social Media Design.</i>  <i>Porfolio: <a href="http://nasibov.me/">nasibov.me</a> If you have any questions please email me: ramin@nasibov.me</i> <i><br></i> </p><br><p>  I needed to update the images on my site. <a href="https://vialatm.com/"></a>  <a href="https://vialatm.com/"><b>vialatm.com</b></a> .  Acquainted with his representation in the social.  networks, I asked about the cost of work.  Almost immediately I received an offer to discuss everything in a Skype rally.  After 30 minutes, we held talks in Skype.  It turned out that the designer is fluent in Russian.  We agreed that within a week he would prepare original images for my site.  He requested payment of 50% of the total cost of the work.  I offered to pay with PayPal, but he insisted on paying through Payoneer. <br></p><br><p>  Two hours later, I received a request for payment of work and immediately made a payment: <br></p><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/d87/d46/79a/d87d4679a91342d2bb0bf948d2499643.png"><br><br><p>  After that, it became very problematic to communicate with him.  He didn‚Äôt answer because he was far from the computer, he didn‚Äôt appear at the Skype-organized meetings because of problems with the Internet. <br></p><br><p>  On June 22, due to the lack of any results and unsuccessful attempts to contact and chat with him, I asked him to return the advance payment. <br></p><br><p>  On June 23, having received no answers, I warned him that I would try to resolve the situation through other channels. <br></p><br><p>  Complete silence.  I had to purchase a website design from another company and buy images on iStock. <br></p><br><p>  On June 25, I sent a complaint to the Payoneer payment system.  And after that he appeared.  Via Skype a message was received from him: <br></p><br><p>  <i>Hello Andrey.</i>  <i>I‚Äôm a scammer of the burglars, I‚Äôm</i>  <i>Unfortunately you had to communicate with scammers on my behalf.</i>  <i>As a result, they were not only received.</i>  <i>Contact us clients requested advances.</i>  <i>At the moment, I was able to</i>  <i>After gaining access back, it was shocked.</i>  <i>At the moment, I‚Äôm contacting the deceived customers.</i>  <i>From the fraudsters.</i>  <i>I'm really sorry Andrey.</i>  <i>Are you interested in receiving your order?</i> <i><br></i> </p><br><p>  In short, the gist of it is that fraudsters took possession of his accounts, I talked to fraudsters, with the help of lawyers, he returned access to his social networks and other nonsense !: <br></p><br><p>  All this time, on Twitter, he published his new work, and shared photos on Facebook (cats, chairs, ...).  And I duplicated all my recent messages to him by email.  email, twitter and skype. <br></p><br><p>  On June 28, he proposed performing work within 1-2 days. <br></p><br><p>  But I refused and demanded the return of the money (within two weeks after the payment I didn‚Äôt even receive a sketch, and he responded only after I applied to Payoneer). <br>  After that, he finally disappeared. <br></p><br><p>  Once again I decided to take a look at the works of this designer and my attention was attracted by the publication on Twitter - the work for the company ‚ÄúCoffeepolitan‚Äù <a href="https://twitter.com/RaminNasibov">https://twitter.com/RaminNasibov.</a> <br></p><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/431/c2e/ecf/431c2eecf53a41178cbbd4893ff31370.jpg">

    <p>  The cup and the wooden background in the pictures are different (but it‚Äôs not hard to find any work in the cups and the wooden background), but the pictures of the world map for coffee are the same. <br></p><br><p>  Very interesting which image is the original, and which copy? <br></p><br><p>  By the way, this designer has two sites <a href="http://nasibov.me/">http://nasibov.me/</a> and <a href="http://pixelin.me/">http://pixelin.me/</a> with <a href="http://pixelin.me/impressum">impressum</a> <br></p><br><p>  Conclusions from all this - contracts for work must be accompanied by clear legal documents.  They should provide for sanctions not only for disrupting the deadlines, but also the responsibility for obtaining images, to which the rights of third parties can be claimed. <br></p></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/333668/">https://habr.com/ru/post/333668/</a></p>
