New, not only after the appearance at the beginning of the year, but also in the direction.  Youvend is a procurement automation system for the HoReCa market, that is, the catering industry.  This is the first such solution in web format.  There are separate web-catalogs of goods or suppliers, Youvend also solves four levels of tasks: search and selection of goods, procurement, communication, and reporting.

    <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  <b>Why HoReCa?</b> <br><br>  Interest in HoReCa did not arise by chance.  This is a huge market (in Moscow alone about eight thousand restaurants), in which the automation of processes is completely absent.  There are only R-Keeper and iiko, but they do not solve the issue of communications in procurement.  As for the kitchen and procurement of it, here all questions are solved in the old manner, that is, by phone.  A cook can take up to several hours a day to talk about finding the right product in the right amount at the right price.  In addition, in addition to outgoing calls, there is a large amount of telephone spam from suppliers wishing to report on new arrivals, discounts, replacement of positions.  This creates a kind of procurement philosophy in any kitchen - and it consists in constant communication. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/14f/3b3/14e/14f3b314e8ebb0eaf8e8aaa2318e566f.png" alt="image"><br><br>  We decided to combine it with our philosophy, which states that the future of any communication lies in the digital plane.  The progressive part of humanity has long stepped from the phone, first to e-mail, and then to social networks and instant messengers.  Why there were no such decisions before, we decided not to find out, but to offer such a solution to the market.  In fact, HoReCa for us is the first item, as one of the most difficult markets.  If we can realize our plans here, then in any other area in which purchases arise, we can repeat this. <br><br>  <b>Work principles</b> <br><br>  Youvend is directed on the one hand to suppliers and manufacturers, and on the other - to customers.  The supplier creates a profile in which he registers all the details: his product catalog, working conditions and delivery, minimum order quantity, timings, cost and payment procedure.  The restaurant with the help of a catalog or search string finds the right product and sees a list of suppliers.  The system also helps to automatically select the most favorable conditions.  If the products are not available, the restaurant may announce a tender for one or another product.  Suppliers will be able to post special offers in the future.  And this is only part of the functions, we will tell about the rest in the following posts. <br><br>  Also, the system allows you to see the remnants of products on the supplier's fold, in order to always be aware of the availability of goods, in the future there will be a full document flow. <br><br>  All communications within the system are performed using the system of incoming / outgoing messages and e-mail alerts, which is usual for any modern user of any platform.  We want to bring such a system into the kitchen of Russian restaurants and cafes. <br><br>  <b>Successes and future plans</b> <br><br>  Already, we have connected to the system more than 450 suppliers with current and detailed information about them.  More than 100 suppliers uploaded in our system their products to our catalog, and now it has 38,000 items.  More than 400 restaurants have joined the system, announcing dozens of active tenders.  For these tenders for the month of work was concluded deals in a million dollars.  The service has not yet come to monetize, but the volumes are already impressive. <br><br>  Youvend full automation of procurement starts on July 1. <br><br>  If we talk about the mission of the blog on Habrahabr, the service will be of interest to representatives of suppliers and manufacturers, as well as HoReCa employees who are responsible for maintenance (for example, working with the support of R-Keeper, Iiko, ico-net, Jupiter, Store House) and others).  We are also ready to share our development experience and answer questions related to them.  If you are a representative of the restaurant and want to leave a request for connection, visit our website - <a href="http://youvend.ru/">youvend.ru</a> .  After filling in the registration form, part of the system functions will immediately be available, full access will be opened after confirmation by our managers. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/566/3a1/8b2/5663a18b2327a103baa74522af5d3777.png" alt="image"><br><br>  In the new posts of our blog, you will learn about how the sales department is organized, the technical development and project management features, as well as the details of other functions of our system.  Hope for acceptance and feedback. <br><br>  Respectfully, <br>  Team youvend <br><br>  <i><b>PS:</b> If you are interested in this material and you would like to know more about the service right now, you can <a href="http://www.hopesandfears.com/hopesandfears/ideas/experience/127897-youvend">read an interview with Youvend CEO Max Meshcheryakov in Hopes and Fears</a> .</i> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/223605/">https://habr.com/ru/post/223605/</a></p>
