What to focus on?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  <i><a href="https://ringostat.com/">Ringostat</a> Operations Director Julia Golovko compares mobile and desktop technologies in the question of effectively finding the desired product or service on the Internet.</i> <br><br>  The broad coverage of home Internet and mobile 3 / 4G allows you to passively view the huge amount of information that we use when making purchasing decisions.  Users read reviews, comments, critical notes, advertisements.  Some of this volume of information is accounted for by laptops, but the share of information that potential customers draw from being in minibuses or at boring events from the screens of smartphones or tablets is also actively growing. <br><br>  This situation drastically affects the distribution of advertising budgets.  Why are mobile technologies gradually catching up with desktops in the competition of advertising platforms?  Here are some of the arguments users give:

    <ul><li>  Mobile phones are always on hand when there is a free minute for messaging or reading news; </li><li>  The 5.7-inch smartphone screen is fully capable of replacing both a tablet and a laptop for passive information perception; </li><li>  A large number of applications with their push notifications make using the phone quick and convenient; </li><li>  The ability to immediately make a call for purchase, if something is really interested; </li><li>  The ‚ÄúBuy‚Äù buttons have appeared in social networks, which also generate customer flows; </li><li>  Increased security when using proven applications, compared to the desktop. </li></ul><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/6eb/ef8/a99/6ebef8a99a634640b72844d8361c7142.jpg" alt="image"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  However, mobile devices have enough disadvantages: <br><br><ul><li>  The laptop allows you to work simultaneously with a large number of windows to compare prices and read long-read texts; </li><li>  For online payments, it is more convenient to enter the card number and the transfer amount on a normal keyboard, so as not to accidentally make a mistake in numbers; </li><li>  Large product comparison tables are easier to view on the big screen; </li><li>  A good laptop works quickly with a large number of open tabs; </li><li>  The quality of the connection due to a better WI-FI adapter or a dedicated line is incommensurable with the mobile Internet; </li><li>  On a laptop, it is more convenient to save search results using CntrC-CntrV in a separate document. </li></ul><br><h1>  Purpose of the smartphone - quick purchase of a simple product or service </h1><br>  Although mobile search coverage has increased significantly, the quality level of devices that go to the Internet is still rather low.  According to <a href="http://opensignal.com/reports/2015/08/android-fragmentation/">an</a> OpenSignal <a href="http://opensignal.com/reports/2015/08/android-fragmentation/">study</a> , slightly less than half of the devices work on versions below Android 4.3, with about 5% on super old Android 2.2-2.3.  The situation with software from Apple products is much better, only 15% of them use the latest software. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/620/c87/18d/620c8718dddd66bcb89ca788d3313069.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  As a girl who actively orders online clothing stores, I can share my own experience.  From the mobile you watch and put it in the basket, mark it as you like, but you don‚Äôt buy it, because when you come home you have to look at it again on a larger screen.  I prefer to use opportunities to enlarge the photo of clothes, to see what kind of fabric, how to sew, etc. <br><br>  As a result, the buying process takes place from a laptop.  Especially if you order from foreign sites, where long delivery and expensive products, you will weigh everything three times.  As for mobile purchases, you can simply replenish your account and pay for the tickets that you ordered earlier, to pay the bills. <br><br>  Nevertheless, some sites have begun to use tricks to stimulate the purchase through a mobile application.  So on AliExpress, a discount is offered on the purchase of mobile phones, if it was made from a smartphone. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/313/d26/9ac/313d269ac7cc983dcf3dcafb6211673e.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  In the screenshot you can see that although the official price of the phone starts from 4427 hryvnia, the purchase from the application will reduce the price of goods to 3541 hryvnia.  Agree tempting tactic? <br><br><h1>  Buying via mobile is still inconvenient.  How long? </h1><br>  We, as a call analytics service, are dealing, by the nature of our activity, with both the traffic of calls from mobile search and from the desktop.  Global trends are on the side of smartphones, while users still experience maximum convenience from shopping after learning websites from a laptop. <br><br>  It affects habits and technological lag of the audience in the choice of mobile devices.  According to a Data Insight <a href="http://partnerkin.com/blog/stati/pochemu_ploho_pokupayut_s_mobilnyh_ustrojstv">study</a> , although 30% of Internet users use mobiles to select products and services, only 17% make purchases through them.  Researchers estimate that in 2015, for the whole of Russia and Ukraine, only 9% of orders from the total number were made using a smartphone or tablet. <br><br>  However, businesses need to prepare to create their own applications and provide convenient payment methods from mobile.  Time constraints and barriers to sales and purchases via smartphones are, in fact, a good opportunity to prepare for this sales channel.  When they are removed, there is no time left to set up call tracking and ‚Äúfinish‚Äù the mobile application. <br><br>  Learn more about call tracking on the <a href="http://blog.ringostat.com/">Ringostat blog</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/299864/">https://habr.com/ru/post/299864/</a></p>
