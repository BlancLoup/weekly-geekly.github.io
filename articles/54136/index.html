As a result, <a href="http://www.scribbler.ru/">Scribbler.ru</a> appeared. <br><br><img src="http://scribbler.ru/uploaded/blog/temp/user_profile.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><a name="habracut"></a>

      In March 2008, we had a team of four people: two programmers, a designer and a project manager.  And we sat down to create Scribbler'a. <br>  All initial ideas were based on what we ourselves lacked during our studies at the institutes.  The main needs were the ability to continuously monitor changes in the schedule, as well as work collectively on documents - whether it be group cases or joint preparation of answers to exam questions.  And yet I would like to change the scans of lectures, spurs, well, yes, everyone knows, who ever studied at any institute <br>  Further in the development process, we realized that in addition to the basic study there is also an additional study: meetings with interesting people, conferences, master classes and so on.  I remember that I tracked such events on the website of my university, which was convenient.  But these were the events of only one university.  It was necessary to create a place where all the events would be collected, visiting which you can get interesting information and knowledge.  We decided that the Scribbler is the most suitable place for this.  This is how the Event service appeared. <br><br><img src="http://scribbler.ru/uploaded/blog/temp/events3.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Next we have created a service of the Communities, which are organized in different directions.  We also rethought the storage and file sharing system - this is how Scribbler's Desktop came into being.  There are a lot of opportunities in the Desktop, here you can‚Äôt describe it briefly, but if you watch the site, do not be lazy to click on ‚ÄúMy Desktop‚Äù - you should like it, the programmers put their soul into it. <br><br>  The launch of Scribbler.ru took place recently.  We already had time to participate with him at <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/startup/53351/">Startuppoint</a> , we received some feedback and additional ideas on how to promote the service (a small brain-storm was assigned to our project).  Basically, they boiled down to going forward through state structures (Min. Education, for example).  Well, let's see how it all will be in reality.  It's hard to say yet. <br>  Many accumulated ideas are still waiting in the wings.  But now there is something that can be presented to the general public: <br><br>  The study group page has its own blog, schedule, photo galleries, documents and events. <br><br><img src="http://scribbler.ru/uploaded/blog/temp/timetable.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The desktop is a well-thought-out, easy-to-use interface system - a manager that allows real-time: <br>  - save and use files (listen to audio, watch video) <br>  - online exchange information with groupmates <br><br><img src="http://scribbler.ru/uploaded/blog/temp/desktop2.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The flow of student events allows you to select only the most relevant and interesting events in your city.  This stream is moderated (we now have 4 wonderful female students as content managers), which allows us to maintain high quality content.  Plus, you can mark your participation in one of the events, which will immediately appear in your personal calendar.  You can also keep track of what events are going friends. <br>  Communities on Scribbler can be created by specialization, elective courses or by interests.  You can become a member of one of the existing communities.  And if you wish, organize your own. <br>  Already, the project has investors and is more or less confident on its feet (of course, it does not mean that we somehow earn, but at least we can afford some marketing activities).  Under the project, we collected a good hardware complex of several servers and put it into a colocation at one of the leading Moscow data centers.  Those.  Habra effect, we are not afraid yet;) <br>  In the end I would like to invite everyone to evaluate our service.  And to participate in its further development, if there is a desire and interest.  In general, there are, of course, options to use the service and not only for study;) It will also be nice to see your comments, suggestions and thoughts on the project.  We share impressions in the comments, it is especially interesting to see the views of students. <br><br>  PS Well, in the hearts I can not write about Habr on the basis of writing this post.  I do not understand decisively - why in order to make a preview of how to look like a post or save it in Drafts - some significant karma is necessary ?!  Those.  I have no such possibility, although I have been registered here for a long time and to no one, as they say, ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt shit in the documents‚Äù: (It is very inconvenient and the reasons for this are not clear to me. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/54136/">https://habr.com/ru/post/54136/</a></p>
