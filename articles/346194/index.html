  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How to identify and develop talents in IT</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><p>  Talented employees are, of course, a great happiness for any leader: they are capable of many things, learn quickly, change people around them for the better, charge the team with energy and ideas.  However, such people require a special approach: it is more difficult to influence them, they often take painful criticism, and their growing ambitions can negatively influence the atmosphere in a team. </p><br><p>  Issues of managing talented employees are relevant to many IT managers, regardless of their specific specialization.  That is why we chose talent management as the first topic of a new meeting cycle organized by Yandex - <a href="https://events.yandex.ru/events/meetings/24-jan-2018/%3F_openstat%3DZXZlbnRzO3RlYW1sZWFkO3Bvc3Q7aGFicg">Team Leader Meetup</a> . </p><br><p>  On the eve of the meeting, we asked the panel discussion participants, including <a href="https://habr.com/users/veged/" class="user_link">veged</a> , <a href="https://habr.com/users/gornal/" class="user_link">gornal</a> , <a href="https://habr.com/users/yafinder/" class="user_link">yafinder</a> , to answer a number of questions related to the management of talented employees. </p><br><p> <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/yandex/blog/346194/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/j6/at/x_/j6atx_jzxwt6gy2clyuim9wq27w.png"><br></a> </p><br><p>  All employees, at least potentially, are talented.  But not everyone can unleash their talents and fully realized.  Our first question is connected with this problem: <em>how to reveal the talents of employees and in time to discover their ambitions?</em> </p><br><p>  Another problem is the amount of compensation.  Of course, in any company, as well as in any division of a particular company, the total amount of funds allocated for employee compensation is limited.  This limited amount of resources is required to be distributed between team members.  Some of them are clearly growing faster than others.  Our second question is related to this: <em>how to distribute the limited amount of compensation in teams with rapidly growing talents?</em> </p><a name="habracut"></a><br><p>  The next difficulty lies in the fact that, increasing the area of ‚Äã‚Äãresponsibility of the employee, it is rarely possible not to limit the area of ‚Äã‚Äãresponsibility of someone else.  New activities arise irregularly and may not be enough to satisfy the ambitions of all team members.  Therefore, situations necessarily arise when a certain employee becomes the leader of an already formed team.  It is important that none of its participants take this as aggression or an indication of its incompetence.  Therefore, our third question is: is <em>it possible to increase the employee‚Äôs area of ‚Äã‚Äãresponsibility and not destroy the motivation of already established teams?</em> </p><br><p>  Finally, from time to time, any employee, even the most talented, makes mistakes.  It is important at such moments to convey to him constructive feedback.  But talented people, especially those who already have a significant success story, are often very sensitive to criticism.  Therefore, our fourth question: is <em>there a safe and effective way of conveying negative feedback to ambitious employees</em> ? </p><br><h2 id="sergey-berezhnoyhttpseventsyandexrulibpeople34-rukovoditel-otdela-razrabotki-poiskovyh-interfeysov-yandeks">  <a href="https://events.yandex.ru/lib/people/34/">Sergey Berezhnoy</a> , Head of Search Interfaces Development, Yandex </h2><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/_s/z8/ch/_sz8chjfzxaa2z40x6pycmrhtde.png"></p><br><p>  <strong>How to identify the talents of employees and time to discover their ambitions?</strong> <br>  It is necessary to provide employees with the opportunity to work on a large number of various projects, while not fully controlling the work process, but leaving room for the realization of their own ideas.  In addition, it is important to just talk with employees about their ambitions and expectations more often. </p><br><p>  <strong>How to distribute a limited amount of compensation in teams with rapidly growing talents?</strong> <br>  It seems to me that talent does not play a decisive role in discussing this issue.  Compensation of a particular employee should always be proportional to his contribution to the common cause.  In my opinion, the performance review system is quite suitable for the implementation of this idea, for which the following points are particularly important: </p><br><ul><li>  Simultaneity for all;  This makes it possible to compare different people among themselves. </li><li>  Collectiveness: the mark is not set individually by the team of managers, but is discussed both up the chain and ‚Äúto the side‚Äù (with other leaders of the same level) </li></ul><br><p>  <strong>Is it possible to increase the area of ‚Äã‚Äãresponsibility of an employee and not destroy the motivation of already established teams?</strong> <br>  Around me, in Yandex, in any team of work is always much more than people.  Therefore, any existing team will be glad to help: it can be both the inclusion of a new employee as part of the team to strengthen certain areas, and the allocation of some part of the activity in another division. </p><br><p>  <strong>Is there a safe and effective way to deliver negative feedback to ambitious employees?</strong> <br>  There is no recipe working in one hundred percent of situations.  We can only try to reduce the possible damage: </p><br><ul><li>  pre-spell out targets in advance; </li><li>  discuss intermediate results as often as possible, try to synchronize the perception of the achieved results; </li><li>  immerse the employee in the common value system, make him an "accomplice" of his own assessment;  it is useful here to ensure that the assessment by the employee, based on criteria known to him, coincides as often as possible with his assessment by colleagues and other managers. </li></ul><br><h2 id="aleksandr-gornyyhttpscorpmailrurucompanyteam49-direktor-po-strategii-i-analizu-mailru-group">  <a href="https://corp.mail.ru/ru/company/team/49/">Alexander Gorny</a> , Director for Strategy and Analysis, Mail.Ru Group </h2><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/qb/w5/ka/qbw5kaziep_0cftxud79qta2-cm.png"></p><br><p>  <strong>How to identify the talents of employees and time to discover their ambitions?</strong> <br>  If talent needs to be revealed, then it is not talent.  The task of the head is not to interfere with his disclosure, to give tasks and resources to solve them.  As for ambitions, I do not know a tool better than a conversation and a direct question. </p><br><p>  <strong>How to distribute a limited amount of compensation in teams with rapidly growing talents?</strong> <br>  There is no silver bullet, it is necessary to act depending on the specific situation. </p><br><p>  <strong>Is it possible to increase the area of ‚Äã‚Äãresponsibility of an employee and not destroy the motivation of already established teams?</strong> <br>  The Internet, fortunately, is a growing industry, opportunities for expansion always arise.  I had no experience of working in a stagnant company. </p><br><p>  <strong>Is there a safe and effective way to deliver negative feedback to ambitious employees?</strong> <br>  Straight in the forehead and supported by facts.  ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre too lagging behind the deadlines, all three of your customers are talking about this, I see that too, look at task-XXX and task-YYY, they are similar to ZZZ, but you took twice as long as it took then.‚Äù </p><br><h2 id="andrey-plahovhttpseventsyandexrulibpeople15-rukovoditel-otdela-funkcionalnosti-poiska-yandeks">  <a href="https://events.yandex.ru/lib/people/15/">Andrey Plakhov</a> , head of search functionality, Yandex </h2><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/0y/oc/hp/0yochp8medh-jmn1q4llafstjxu.png"></p><br><p>  <strong>How to identify the talents of employees and time to discover their ambitions?</strong> <br>  Talent consists of two parts: a burning desire to do their job better than ever, and the ability to really achieve this.  Therefore, it is easiest to find talent in the early stages, in tasks considered simple, among students or even among schoolchildren. </p><br><p>  <strong>How to distribute a limited amount of compensation in teams with rapidly growing talents?</strong> <br>  Almost all the "resources", except, in fact, money, have different attractiveness for different people.  Someone wants to go to an international conference, and someone would like to be given ‚Äúmoney‚Äù instead.  Growing employees should get first of all ‚Äúgrowth resources‚Äù, this is more correct for both the company and for them.  The main thing is that they themselves understand this. </p><br><p>  <strong>Is it possible to increase the area of ‚Äã‚Äãresponsibility of an employee and not destroy the motivation of already established teams?</strong> <br>  If the motivation of an already established team can be destroyed by instructing someone fresh and bright to improve their work, it means that the team has gone completely wrong. </p><br><p>  <strong>Is there a safe and effective way to deliver negative feedback to ambitious employees?</strong> <br>  Almost everyone who has children, on an intuitive level, understands the following rule: you can tell a child that he did a bad thing, but you cannot tell him that he is bad.  Good children like you should not do so badly.  Somehow it is necessary with outstanding employees (only, of course, without ‚Äúadult‚Äù arrogance). </p><br><h2 id="nikolay-suetinhttpskrufoundationteamppersonaspxunnsuetin-vice-prezident-po-nauke-i-obrazovaniyu-skolkovo-foundation">  <a href="http://sk.ru/foundation/team/p/person.aspx%3Fun%3Dnsuetin">Nikolay Suetin</a> , Vice President for Science and Education, Skolkovo Foundation </h2><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/k6/ag/jz/k6agjz53qacmu_5i1frrkfixtro.png"></p><br><p>  <strong>How to identify the talents of employees and time to discover their ambitions?</strong> <br>  Talents are always identified in the work on specific projects.  If the projects are diverse, then the talents are needed different.  And this, as a rule, and different people.  All talented people are ambitious, but they must understand that talent is only a prerequisite for success (both personal and team).  It is necessary that the talents be further complemented by hard work, willingness to teamwork and the ability to soberly assess their capabilities.  It is important to convey to all employees that their career ambitions can be based only on the whole complex of the listed qualities. </p><br><p>  <strong>How to distribute a limited amount of compensation in teams with rapidly growing talents?</strong> <br>  Indeed, it is extremely difficult to divide the ‚Äúlimited amount of compensation‚Äù among strong players.  However, it is not for nothing that, as a rule, compensation is called ‚Äústimulating.‚Äù  They should be not just an addition to the salary, but also stimulate everyone to develop in the direction in which the company‚Äôs management is interested.  It is desirable that the marked achievements should be reflected in the order on the payment of compensation. </p><br><p>  <strong>Is it possible to increase the area of ‚Äã‚Äãresponsibility of an employee and not destroy the motivation of already established teams?</strong> <br>  The principle of meritocracy is one of the most objective and ‚Äúperceived‚Äù by employees.  In my opinion, if an increase in the responsibility zone of the strongest employee (even at the expense of other team members) leads to the achievement of better overall results and this will be objectively shown (preferably by measured indicators), then this only stimulates the rest. </p><br><p>  <strong>Is there a safe and effective way to deliver negative feedback to ambitious employees?</strong> <br>  When reporting negative reviews, it is necessary to show their maximum objectivity.  In the practice of many companies, a ‚Äú360 degree evaluation method‚Äù has been introduced.  It is anonymous and allows you to show the weaknesses of the employee.  The second important objective indicator is the performance of the employee as his personal KPI, and his participation in the implementation of KPI of the entire unit.  Reporting these assessments at individual meetings is one of the main tasks of the leader.  Also, as a result of such assessments and meetings, as a rule, a ‚Äúdevelopment plan‚Äù is written, which will allow the employee to develop as a promising member of the team. </p><br><h2 id="irina-fedulovahttpswwwlinkedincominirinafedulova-veduschiy-nauchnyy-sotrudnik-phillips-innovation-labs-rus">  <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/irinafedulova/">Irina Fedulova</a> , Leading Researcher, Phillips Innovation Labs RUS </h2><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/og/bh/ff/ogbhffo8w0l9_g768kn2yhzlpb4.png"></p><br><p>  <strong>How to identify the talents of employees and time to discover their ambitions?</strong> <br>  The talents of employees and their ambitions are revealed as a result of observation of their activities and in the process of communication with them.  The head must be attentive and observant: you need to pay attention to how the employee copes with the tasks.  Talent is what a person copes with perfectly, easily and with pleasure.  Conversations with the direct manager about what the employee seeks in the long term (career ambitions) should occur at least twice a year - for example, during a performance review.  It is important that the group has a good climate: employees must feel mutual respect, trust, openness both in communication with their colleagues and with managers. </p><br><p>  <strong>How to distribute a limited amount of compensation in teams with rapidly growing talents?</strong> <br>  It is well known that money is not the best motivator.  However, when there is an employee who is clearly not very satisfied with his compensation, this should be investigated.  If the compensation is indeed lower than the market, you need to increase it.  Different companies use different mechanisms for this.  There are also personal circumstances when you really need money.  If compensation is adequate competence, but ambitions are higher than the market, we look at how adequate they are. <br>  It is worth betting on the bonus part of the compensation, tied to the implementation of KPI.  Intangible methods of motivation should also be used: elevation of status, responsibility for projects, promotion and so on.  It is worth remembering that an employee who is motivated only by material gain is not loyal and can leave at any time. </p><br><p> <strong>Is it possible to increase the area of ‚Äã‚Äãresponsibility of an employee and not destroy the motivation of already established teams?</strong> <br>  A solid rationale for this choice is needed.  It is necessary to convey this rationale to all team members, having a separate conversation with each of them.  An employee who has gone on an increase must understand that he is responsible for ensuring that the climate in the team does not deteriorate;  he should behave decently, not ask.  Other team members should clarify that this change is positive for them, give them the opportunity to improve their self-esteem in some other way, for example, by proposing to be responsible for a certain project.  Standard methods of team motivation should be used: quick wins, quick (small) successful projects are urgently needed. </p><br><p>  <strong>Is there a safe and effective way to deliver negative feedback to ambitious employees?</strong> <br>  In general, touchy ambitious employees are a rather risky human resource.  If they have a bad influence on the climate in the team, it may be safer to part with them.  If they respond to feedback adequately, then you can give a few simple standard tips: </p><br><ul><li>  need to discuss specific examples; </li><li>  you need to talk about facts, not to interpret; </li><li>  criticize the actions, not the person; </li><li>  linked to impact: demonstrate the effects of undesirable behavior; </li><li>  Be sure to praise! </li><li>  to draw up an action plan to overcome a crisis situation. </li></ul><br><h2 id="aleksey-shagraevhttpseventsyandexrulibpeople14407387-rukovoditel-sluzhby-svezhe-socialnogo-poiska-yandeks">  <a href="https://events.yandex.ru/lib/people/14407387/">Alexey Shagraev</a> , Head of <a href="https://events.yandex.ru/lib/people/14407387/">Fresh</a> Social Search, Yandex </h2><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/s2/ap/vt/s2apvtk_irywzurwfpymdszmfy4.png"></p><br><p>  <strong>How to identify the talents of employees and time to discover their ambitions?</strong> <br>  All people, including your employees, are talented.  There are only two problems: the wrong area of ‚Äã‚Äãactivity and faith in yourself.  There are areas of activity, when confronted with which a person begins to pour ideas and express a reasonable dissatisfaction with the current state of affairs - these are the areas that are able to reveal his talents.  At the same time, it is important to support him, to give the opportunity to realize and test his ideas - so he will gain faith in his abilities. </p><br><p>  <strong>How to distribute a limited amount of compensation in teams with rapidly growing talents?</strong> <br>  I believe that companies should use a proactive motivation system.  When the amount of compensation is determined by previous merit and is carried out on a regular basis, a fast-growing employee at any given time receives a salary that does not correspond to his current level.  It is quite normal to award an employee, bearing in mind what he will become in six months, and not what he was in the previous six months. </p><br><p>  <strong>Is it possible to increase the area of ‚Äã‚Äãresponsibility of an employee and not destroy the motivation of already established teams?</strong> <br>  In my opinion, this is impossible.  If someone was made my boss by combining several groups, it means he was worth it, but I wasn‚Äôt.  When the opportunity is not realized, it is always insulting.  It is important to work with this insult correctly: explain what the reason for such a decision is, what qualities were not enough and how they can be obtained in further work. </p><br><p>  <strong>Is there a safe and effective way to deliver negative feedback to ambitious employees?</strong> <br>  It is very important that a person constantly understands that criticism serves his own improvement.  I think here we need to use two basic rules. </p><br><ul><li>  Every team needs to maintain a healthy culture of discussion and criticism.  After all, criticism is the main motive for obtaining any new knowledge!  In a normal workflow, you can discuss and criticize meeting formats, goal statements, programming style, and so on.  If the team is accustomed to the fact that any question could potentially be brought up for discussion, criticism of a particular employee in the 1x1 format will not be perceived by him as something that goes beyond the usual course of things. </li><li>  The employee should formulate the problem and find the solution.  If this happened, then the probability of frustration will be reduced to a minimum, because the person himself acted as his critic.  In addition, such a process allows an employee to learn how to continually analyze and work on himself.  The role of the leader is to help him in this: to ask the right questions, to support, to tell about how the incident has affected the other teams. </li></ul><br><hr><br><p>  The first meeting, which you can still <a href="https://events.yandex.ru/events/meetings/24-jan-2018/%3F_openstat%3DZXZlbnRzO3RlYW1sZWFkO3Bvc3Q7aGFicg">register</a> , will be held on January 24, 2018 in the Moscow office of Yandex.  There you can ask questions to the speakers and share their experiences. </p></div>
