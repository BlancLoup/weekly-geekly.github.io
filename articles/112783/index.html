In many ways, this separation is even convenient. <br><br>  Agree that the social graphs of different networks are very different due to the fact that each of them provides different functionality and, accordingly, users on them do different things.  However, from the user's point of view, a little mutual integration would not hurt them.  What I mean by this integration, and what benefits it might have gained from this company, will be discussed. <br><br>  I‚Äôll consider Twitter, Facebook / VKontakte and Last.fm as concrete examples. <br><a name="habracut"></a>

    <h5>  For starters - specific examples of some inconveniences. </h5><br>  VKontakte has recently introduced the microblogging function, after which the walls of users have become like Twitter with <a href="http://lurkmore.ru/%25D0%2591%25D0%25BB%25D1%258D%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B6%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BA_%25D0%25B8_%25D1%2588%25D0%25BB%25D1%258E%25D1%2585%25D0%25B8">what you know</a> .  Good or bad - this issue in the discussion will be left out.  Take it for granted.  It is logical to assume that similar functionality will be used in a similar way.  It also seems logical that the user using the same features will create about the same content.  That is, writing about something on his wall, he is likely to write the same thing on Twitter and vice versa.  A similar situation may arise with a wall on Facebook.  In this regard, it would be nice when writing a message on your wall, say, to have some ‚ÄúTweet it too‚Äù checkbox.  Or, on Twitter, "Post on Facebook". <br><br>  Often I have seen people listen to music mainly on VK.  It is quite logical - there you can find music for every taste, it does not require hard disk space, only a more or less stable channel.  Here comes the stage Last.fm.  Agree, it would be interesting, say, directly from the VC to have access to the charts of users.  But what would be really convenient here is scrobbling for VC.  Of course, there is already Last.fm in VKontakte, but as an application, and this is something completely different. <br><br>  In the opposite direction: I put some composition on Last.fm on my favorite list.  It would probably be nice to share this news with friends in other networks - there are a lot of those who may be interested in this. <br><br>  If I express a desire to go to any event at Last.fm, it would be nice to also be noted in the corresponding meeting on Facebook / VK, if such exists and vice versa. <br><br>  This list goes on and on.  If you add to the above networks YouTube - even longer. <br><br><h5>  Implementation </h5><br>  I think the first thing that comes to mind is various extensions / add-ons for browsers or corresponding widgets on websites.  However, the ability to stick a widget is far from everywhere, and add-ons are inconvenient because they need to be searched and installed.  For each browser on each device from which you are going to go online.  And on someone else's computer they may simply not be.  Meh.  It would be much more convenient to have all this out of the box, not to depend on the browser. <br><br>  Of course, some of the above are already implemented to some extent.  Say, last.fm has the opportunity to tweet or post on Facebook'e the upcoming concert.  However, if I want to report this significant VKontakte event, then I have to resort to the old, like the world, copy-paste.  Naturally, even without the ‚ÄúLike‚Äù button, we used to live somehow, but it‚Äôs somehow easier and more comfortable with it, isn't it? <br><br><h6>  So how can this be done? </h6><br>  Those who are familiar with OOP and at least heard about design patterns know that sometimes it is better to spend more time and write more code that can then be taken and used than reinventing the wheel every time.  Thus, if we develop a standard for exchanging information between the profiles of the same user in different networks, we will no longer depend on the developers who add the ‚ÄúLike‚Äù button, but believe that ‚ÄúTweet‚Äù is not needed here, but about VKontakte with its "I like it" did not hear. <br><br><h6>  A little more about how it might look. </h6><br>  To begin with, it is necessary to ‚Äúlink‚Äù the accounts of different networks.  The process might look something like this: A @ X sends a request for a bundle of B @ Y, after which B must confirm that yes, A is me, but on network X. Yes, yes, about the same thing happens when you specify one e-mail as additional. <br><br>  Next comes the question of how to link the various functions.  When I think about it, I have an association with Obj-C / Cocoa's IBOutlet.  Of course, the analogy is strained, but we are still considering only an abstract model, so some inaccuracies are forgivable.  In fact, we have ‚Äúsockets‚Äù, which we can combine in various ways (limiting ourselves, of course, to common sense).  What kind of "sockets" can this be: <br><br>  Text: <br><ul><li>  Post X on another resource too </li><li>  Share X on another resource (de-facto retweet) </li></ul><br>  Multimedia: the same as with the text, but in addition it is necessary to provide the possibility that the direct display of this content is impossible there.  In this case, there should be additional sockets like ‚Äúpost a link to the content‚Äù.  For last.fm and the like - ‚ÄúI'm watching / listening to X‚Äù. <br><br>  There may also be sockets ‚ÄúAllow access to X‚Äù.  They can serve for situations such as the above-mentioned display of a personal charts with Last.fm next to the list of audio records of the user VKontakte, etc. <br><br>  On the other side of these sockets, we will most likely need an appropriate handler.  For example, Twitter will have to use the analog twitlonger.com for too long messages.  Last.fm - process the message about the song you are listening to.  And on Facebook / VKontakte, for example, convert links to a YouTube video or image that this link links to. <br><br>  After the accounts are connected and the sockets are connected, the question arises: how will the user use this?  Let for each outlet there will be a certain object with which it will be logically connected and will be displayed in a block specially allocated for sockets next to this object. <br><br>  On the example of Twitter: next to Favorite / Retweet / Reply there will be ‚ÄúLike‚Äù and / or ‚ÄúLike‚Äù buttons - depending on whether we tied your Twitter account to your Facebook or VKontakte account or both.  And next to the Tweet button, there are ticks "Post on Facebook" and / or "Write on the wall", etc.  Here, ‚ÄúLike‚Äù is associated with the ‚Äúseparate tweet‚Äù object, and ‚ÄúPost on ...‚Äù with the ‚ÄúTweet‚Äù button. <br><br>  Or an example: the ability, when uploading photos to Facebook, immediately duplicate them on VKontakte.  Or tweet one of them or a whole album. <br><br><h5>  And what's up with this network? </h5><br>  The advantages are quite obvious - the influx of users from other networks.  Given that their orientation is different (except for Facebook-VKontakte), they are in different niches and are unlikely to interfere with each other.  On the contrary, they will acquire opportunities that they did not originally have.  Since this interaction involves not complete, but only partial integration at the level of some basic functions, the number of visits will not fall, because  for the full functionality will need to go to the site. <br>  If an attempt is made to get into a foreign niche (for example, the already mentioned introduction of VKontakte microblogging), users will have an alternative that.  definitely good. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/112783/">https://habr.com/ru/post/112783/</a></p>
