  <section class="page js-page"><h1>NFC in the world of sports - 5 examples</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The abbreviation of <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/gemaltorussia/blog/317120/">NFC</a> in the IT industry denotes the technology of short-range wireless communication Near Field Communication, which uses magnetic field induction for communication between devices.  How can NFC technology be useful for sports competitions?  Can contactless technology in general improve the world of sports?  Of course!  Here are just five real-world examples of how NFC is already used in sports - and not only at short distances. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/hq/0q/r9/hq0qr9_4uq6g0eq5b6cdwzhfiey.jpeg" width="100%"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h3>  1. Best running shoes </h3><br>  Running is one of the most common ways to keep fit.  For example, in Great Britain alone today there are more than 10.5 million people involved in jogging, and in the US their number is about 6 times more - and they all regularly use running shoes.  Adidas has recently found a way to improve these shoes with NFC - more recently, they are installing NFC chips in many models of their sneakers, which allows consumers to see information about a particular model in the Adidas mobile app. <br><br>  The company does not intend to stop there and has much more ambitious plans for this technology.  In particular, Adidas plans to provide users with the ability to send their feedback directly to the company, including detailed information about how well the shoes fit and how they behave in various situations.  Thanks to Adidas chips will get more data that will allow the company to create better shoes.  And the more sneakers with built-in chips the company will sell, the more information it will be able to receive, and the wider opportunities will open up before it to improve the functional running shoes.

      Adidas already uses this data when creating sneakers, which take into account the characteristics of runners from a particular city.  As it turned out, people running in London are different from people running in New York.  As a result, Adidas recently introduced a new model, called the AM4LDN - ‚ÄúAdidas made for London‚Äù (Adidas - made for London), and soon intends to present a model of sneakers for people running in Paris. <br><br><h3>  2. Expansion of opportunities for fans </h3><br>  The US National Basketball Association (NBA) is actively working to allow fans to visually reach the front row in 2017 thanks to the release of the new official Nike sportswear.  Technological innovations used in new T-shirts are likely to change the sports equipment industry forever.  In particular, they have an NFC chip installed, which, being connected to the viewer's phone, allows you to see exclusive information about the game, including real-time game statistics, cutting with the best game moments, special offers, and even playlists with your favorite players music. . <br><br>  These ‚Äúsmart t-shirts‚Äù will help fans add interactive elements to the game viewing and get close to their favorite players.  T-shirts are now <a href="https://www.nike.com/gb/en_gb/c/nba/jerseys">available</a> . <br><br><h3>  3. Simplification of the passage to the stadiums </h3><br>  Many are familiar with the minutes, sometimes seemingly forever, when you have to stand in line for each other while waiting for you to be let into the stadium before you can enjoy the game of your favorite team.  All that I want at this moment - finally take your place and get ready for the spectacle.  If only there was a way to speed up the passage to the stadium ... If you came to the game of a major baseball league with Oakland Athletics, then we can assume that you were lucky! <br><br>  This team launches a ticketing solution using NFC technology, thanks to which fans can enter the stadium by attaching their iPhone (or Apple Watch) to the ticket scanner - just like when paying for purchases.  This method uses NFC technology, which is used in contactless club cards through the service Apple Pay. <br><br>  However, so far this is the first time that this technology is used for non-discount or prepaid gift cards.  So this is actually a big step forward, and using NFC technology will save baseball fans a lot of time. <br><br><h3>  4. Countering the illegal trade in sports souvenirs </h3><br>  Unfortunately, the sale of sports souvenirs and collectibles is often associated with fraud.  It is almost impossible to avoid fakes - and a rare memorable thing bought for big money may turn out to be just a fake. <br><br>  But here NFC tags come to the rescue!  The legendary NFL player, Emmitt Smith (Emmitt Smith), founded a startup that produces NFC chips the size of a postage stamp, allowing you to track when and who wore this or that item and whether this item was used in the game.  In addition to the fact that the smart tags PROVA track items, they also allow you to detect stolen items, which ultimately makes it difficult for criminals to sell stolen items. <br><br>  This is a win-win for both fans and the NFL, and at the same time a serious obstacle for any intruders trying to kidnap or sell stolen paraphernalia.  Thus, new technologies will help avoid the repetition of such embarrassment as, for example, with Tom Brady‚Äôs stolen T-shirt, in which he spoke at the Super Bowl, and recently discovered by a foreign journalist. <br><br><h3>  5. Facilitate stadium shopping </h3><br>  Buying snacks and drinks at large sports can take a lot of time.  Long lines, various hitch, mainly when paying, numerous fans who consider missing the change or trying to remember the PIN code from the card.  Once again, NFC technology comes to the rescue.  Last year, within the framework of cooperation with the NFL and the San Francisco 49ers team, the international payment system Visa installed about 700 NFC-enabled sales terminals at the Levi's Stadium stadium, thanks to which cardholders could pay for food, drinks or souvenirs during the game by simply attaching or paying terminal card or using your smartphone.  And in the UK, Gemalto used NFC bracelets for the same purpose in the home stadium of the Saracens football club. <br><br>  So, we gave five examples of how NFC technology helps to improve the world of sports.  What is your opinion on this?  Perhaps you can give other examples of using NFC in sports?
