  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Knowledge management. Where to start</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Employees come and go, switch from project to project, move from department to department.  And each time you have to spend a large amount of resources on introducing a new employee in the course of affairs.  In the end, human memory is imperfect and everything tends to be forgotten.  And it can relate to the understanding of business processes, as well as to technical / technological things. <br><br>  There is no way to avoid this, but the costs of knowledge transfer can be reduced.  For this is the discipline called <strong>Knowledge Management</strong> . <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><blockquote>  <strong>Knowledge</strong> <em>management</em> is the systematic processes by which the knowledge necessary for the success of an organization is recognized, created, preserved, distributed and applied.  Since 1995, knowledge management has become an established scientific discipline, with university courses taught and professional and academic publications devoted to this topic. </blockquote><br>  In full, knowledge management is a large scientific discipline, but in practice it is enough to use a small subset - the Knowledge Base. <br><blockquote>  Today, <strong>the knowledge base</strong> is one of the most important assets of a modern organization.  Knowledge is information in context that can produce an action-inducing awareness. </blockquote><br>  <strong>In order to organize and develop the Knowledge Base there is just one condition: ‚ÄúA Person Who Is More Everyone Needed is necessary‚Äù.</strong>  <strong>Those.</strong>  <strong>Someone in the company should have enough strength to take the responsibility to push through and start such an initiative, and then constantly monitor and monitor the process of filling.</strong>

      <em><strong>For those who believe that he has the strength to start organizing, I will cite a few rules, following which will significantly increase the success of the implementation of the Knowledge Base.</strong></em> <br><br>  <strong>1. Start small</strong> <br><br>  In some companies, employees do not even share information, let alone knowledge.  To change the situation for the better, you can first provide access to basic information about the work and products of other departments, to their business plans, as well as to formalized knowledge (reports, indicators for the prospect, materials for seminars). <br><br>  Simple knowledge bases can be used to store data about the organization: documentation, manuals, technical support articles.  The main goal of creating such databases is to help less experienced people to <em>find an existing description of</em> how to solve any problem in the domain. <br><br>  <strong>2. Do not be too carried away with information technology.</strong> <br><br>  In fact, the main thing in your work is culture, management methods and, most importantly, people.  However, proven technologies need to be used.  However, a constant analysis of their application is required based on feedback received from employees.  This will help improve technology if necessary. <br><br>  <strong>3. Avoid excessive formalization.</strong> <br><br>  It is very important that the accumulation of knowledge does not turn into a purely formal, and in fact - a useless process by which the staff. <br><br>  <strong>4. Be selective!</strong> <br><br>  You should not try to identify and systematize all available information.  If the information you gather is too detailed, it will be extremely difficult to choose something really valuable for the employees, and it will turn into a huge, uncontrollable bureaucratic nightmare. <br><br>  <strong>5. Regularly evaluate achievements.</strong> <br><br>  How far have you come?  Have you encountered something unexpected?  What was possible and what did not?  How should you adjust your strategy based on the knowledge you gained in the process? <br>  <em><strong>When I talk about my experience in implementing the Knowledge Base, they always ask me the same questions, so I will try to answer them.</strong></em> <em><strong><br></strong></em> <br>  <strong>1. What software to use for the Knowledge Base?</strong> <br><br>  What is convenient for you.  I use <a href="http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/MediaWiki" rel="nofollow">Mediawiki</a> . <br><br>  <strong>2. Who and in what cases makes entries in the Knowledge Base?</strong> <br><br>  ‚ÄúThe Man Who Has More Everyone Should,‚Äù begins somewhere to take notes, tells his colleagues, who also begin to use and make edits about it.  (In my case, the introduction of new articles into the Knowledge Base was at first a prerequisite for the staff of my department when studying any new material, about six months later, the content continued without my participation). <br><br>  <strong>3. What is the structure of articles used (even if there is no special structure, there are still some established rules)?</strong> <br><br>  No approved structure is required.  There is such a wonderful concept - self-organization, ‚ÄúThe Man Who Has More All It Should,‚Äù looks after everything. <br>  Moreover, as soon as the Procedures, Rules, Regulations, etc., intervene, the people immediately become cool to writing.  Moreover, the wiki structure allows you to shuffle everything at any time. <br><br>  <strong>4. Who and how in the future uses these records.</strong> <br><br>  <em>Testers, programmers, analysts, managers</em> - when they forget something or do not know something. <br><br>  <em>New employees</em> - this significantly reduces the time of entry of newcomers in the course of work.  When a new employee arrives, first of all I make him read a certain set of articles in the Knowledge Base.  Nor does he distract expensive professionals from work. <br><br>  In this article, based on my own experience, I tried to provide recommendations on the organization of the Knowledge Base as a tool to improve the performance of both individual employees and the company as a whole. <br><br>  <strong>In the process of preparing the article the following sources were used:</strong> <strong><br></strong> <br>  <a href="http://alenacpp.blogspot.com/2008/01/wiki.html" rel="nofollow">Alena C ++.</a>  <a href="http://alenacpp.blogspot.com/2008/01/wiki.html" rel="nofollow">Version control system, bugtrack and wiki</a> <br><br>  <font color="#333333"><a href="http://sorlik.blogspot.com/2007/08/web-20.html" rel="nofollow">From a bird's eye view / Sergey Orlik's blog /.</a></font>  <font color="#333333"><a href="http://sorlik.blogspot.com/2007/08/web-20.html" rel="nofollow">Web 2.0 tools inside the enterprise - who cares?</a></font> <br><br>  <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A3%25D0%25BF%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B2%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B5_%25D0%25B7%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D1%258F%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B8" rel="nofollow">Wikipedia.</a>  <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A3%25D0%25BF%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B2%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B5_%25D0%25B7%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D1%258F%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B8" rel="nofollow">Knowledge management</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/22449/">https://habr.com/ru/post/22449/</a></p>
