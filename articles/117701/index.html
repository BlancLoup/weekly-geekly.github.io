  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Business in your pocket. All iPhone owners are dedicated to</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Today, the Internet is replete with an infinite number of collections that talk about iPhone applications.  In general, they are all about the same thing - about popular, free and even useless widgets.  And if the first manuscripts on this topic were still given some kind of exhaust, now at the sight of the title of the ‚Äú10 most popular applications for the iPhone‚Äù the audience indifferently spells the letter and goes further. <br><br>  The fact is that the meaning in these texts is often no more than in the average temperature in a hospital.  In this regard, we decided to set a new trend and prepare a selection of applications not for all our vast citizens, but only for those who decided to start their own business and succeed.  In addition, we will talk about the sequence in which these applications should appear on your iPhone. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><h5>  Step 1. Set goals </h5><br>  "I want to make a lot of money!".  It's clear.  And if you decide to open your business, then definitely not in the name of justice and not for the sake of a good mood.  Surely you have already formed a cloud of goals that you are going to realize in the foreseeable future.  But not the fact that they are measurable.

        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"

        </script>
      <br>
      In this regard, we suggest you use an extremely primitive widget called <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/ru/app/goal-meter/id361754962%3Fmt%3D8">‚ÄúGoal Meter‚Äù</a> , which means ‚ÄúTarget Meter‚Äù.  Plus its that each goal must be expressed in numerical form.  And the degree of its achievement is determined by a special color bar that fills the screen space. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/57c91722/4124e14b/a3ff620e/aa1a65e8.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/568001f2/79668da4/2b6e3dfa/cf30f6e7.png"><br><br>  The application itself is free, but for $ 0.99 there is an opportunity to get rid of annoying ads forever. <br><br><h5>  Step 2. Attracting investments </h5><br>  Everything should have a measure.  Especially when it comes to investments or loans.  In order to quickly calculate how much interest you have to pay for someone else's contribution to your business, it is enough to get <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/ru/app/percentage-calculator/id391291772%3Fmt%3D8">the Percentage Calculator</a> application. <br><br>  All calculations are made by the standard proportion, but in a matter of seconds. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/9820d143/dd3122ea/bda11978/a2d638e8.png"><br><br>  The widget is available in the free version. <br><br><h5>  Step 3. We distribute tasks </h5><br>  As soon as the goals are spelled out, the money for their implementation is received, it's time to get down to business and start working.  But you don‚Äôt always want to work, especially if you are your own boss.  In this case <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/epicwin/id372927221%3Fmt%3D8">, EpicWin</a> will help increase productivity, which allows you to schedule tasks for the current day and receive bonuses for completing them. <br><br>  The award for hard work can be assigned independently, guided by common sense, of course.  And jokes and animation will help to periodically switch attention. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/de75bd7a/0fd7cba0/90f4b782/6a57cd6a.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/3049f641/f6348a42/5bb58bbd/3cee971a.png"><br><br>  The cost of this pleasure is $ 2.99. <br><br><h5>  Step 4. Increasing the customer base </h5><br>  Once productivity begins to bear fruit, you will need a convenient contact manager.  Otherwise, customers, partners, employees will merge into one pile.  And much nicer when everything is laid out on the shelves. <br><br>  Using the <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/app/groups-sms-mail-manage-contacts/id300891442%3Fmt%3D8">‚ÄúGroups Drag &amp; Drop‚Äù</a> widget <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/app/groups-sms-mail-manage-contacts/id300891442%3Fmt%3D8">,</a> you can create, delete and rename both groups and individual contacts;  move contacts between groups and assign belonging to one or several categories;  send messages by e-mail to the selected list.  In addition, the application can be used for calls and sending messages. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/7674e7c4/de1b5607/0f6ddae1/ee4f105b.jpg"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/35660356/36a93f90/85dd7619/c4e1259e.jpg"><br><br>  This widget will cost you $ 4.99. <br><br><h5>  Step 5. Attract attention to yourself </h5><br>  There is no limit to the number of contacts, and therefore very soon you will need additional efforts to promote your business.  Speaking to an interested audience is one of the best ways to sell your product.  But not everyone is able to perform.  Moreover, some entrepreneurs have such a strong sense of fear of public speaking that the audience of even 10 people causes panic attacks in them. <br><br>  The <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/ru/app/id381649220%3Fmt%3D8">‚ÄúRead-n-Talk‚Äù</a> application (translated as a prompter) will help to gain self-confidence.  With it, you can prepare the text of the speech by selecting the desired font, and rehearse speech by adjusting the speed of reading. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/2bda986d/d7fbe087/580d6fa8/fe93a00c.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/7ef68869/a73dd75c/16f637fd/753b4ab3.png"><br><br>  The application is free. <br><br><h5>  Step 6. We invoice </h5><br>  After the audience attending your speech <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/id417000917%3Fmt%3D8%26ls%3D1">finishes</a> applauding, you can open <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/id417000917%3Fmt%3D8%26ls%3D1">iElba</a> and fill in accounts.  Mobile version of the electronic accountant allows you to get an image of the finished account on the screen of your iPhone.  To do this, you must specify the name of the client company, the names of goods, their quantity and price. <br><br>  Once all the necessary information has been filled out and saved, it will be possible to send the invoice by e-mail, save it in a photo album and print it.  In addition to this, all information is stored in the phone‚Äôs memory, and later you can always return to the document, edit it, or send it to someone. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/1eb93542/aab8bb44/8e3f7df1/93f0d866.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/7f33e44d/666aa8f9/93a230d6/e5f0ebf6.png"><br><br>  The widget can be downloaded absolutely free. <br><br><h5>  Step 7. Protecting interests </h5><br>  From the bag and from the prison it seems like they do not renounce.  Therefore, it would be useful to get a personal lawyer, especially if it is in the form of an application for the iPhone.  The directory <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/ru/app/advokat/id337677669%3Fmt%3D8">"Lawyer"</a> includes about 73 of the most popular codes and laws of the Russian Federation. <br><br>  Search by keyword helps to quickly navigate the flow of legislation.  In addition, for convenience, all laws are broken down into categories: constitution, citizenship, housing, business, money, studies, army, taxes, court, crime, power, and so on. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/69223124/8090f1f1/353af1be/ae410f58.jpg"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/e3b7db19/dd9030e9/4bcc27df/c02a4d5f.jpg"><br><br>  The cost of a lawyer is $ 4.99. <br><br><h5>  Instead of a conclusion and a must-read! </h5><br>  If you have read this material to the end, then you must have an iPhone.  And if you have one, it means that you are a true connoisseur of gadgets, and you probably would like to get a second-generation iPad. <br><br>  If yes, follow <a href="http://www.iguides.ru/forum/showthread.php%3Ft%3D23826">this link</a> and participate in the contest!
