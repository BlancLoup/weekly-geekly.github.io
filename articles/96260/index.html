Therefore, today, on Friday, we decided to publish a material that is not quite typical for Habr - a report on the company‚Äôs trip to the Taimyr Peninsula last summer. <br>  The idea of ‚Äã‚Äãa trip to a place so remote and untouched by people arose spontaneously, but received wide support and heated discussion.  What finally came out of the idea - read on. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/27b/099/73c/27b09973ccd9e7567eec57180ac94348.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><a name="habracut"></a>

      In order to describe our adventures in detail, the format of the post is definitely not enough, the material will be typed into an average brochure.  Therefore, we first focus on the photographs, and tell you what they depict.  Photos were not processed in any way, except for reduction of the size.  The author of the photos is our employee Maxim Klimko.  He is an avid fisherman and lover of northern recreation.  At times it even seems that the gloomy Karelian rivers are dearer to him than the warm sea and soft sand of Turkish (and other) beaches.  Maxim and made the main instigator of the trip.  For the rest, who did not smell powder like wandering, the idea seemed unreal at first, but after mature reflection, we decided to "why not", and began to prepare.  In addition to the purchase of air tickets and equipment (about him below), before the trip it is necessary to attend to the statement of the authorities, in particular, the local Ministry of Emergency Situations and the Directorate of the Reserve to inform about the upcoming visit.  The peninsula has been declared a reserve and entry into it is restricted, and it is rumored that soon they will not let anyone in at all.  Of course, you can not inform anyone, but if you are planning a serious expedition, it is important and necessary to do it.  As a last resort, the Emergencies Ministry will have a list of the group and the route of the expedition, so that rescuers will be able to quickly come to the rescue, happen that.  So we phoned in advance with all the services and sent the necessary data. <br><br>  In general, technically, the peninsula itself as a result, we have not visited.  During our stay we spent in various places of the deep and elongated Lake Lama.  It is located in the conservation, reserve and in every way protected zone, right at the beginning of the "legs" of the peninsula.  Lake of tectonic origin, in the best places the depth reaches 800 meters.  Once there even underwent some kind of nuclear tests, but this did not affect purity (at least, official data says so, but to believe them is somehow calmer).  All 10 days we cooked food and drank water from the lake, and even one of the eight members of the expedition didn‚Äôt even have a banal stomach upset. <br><br>  It took a good purchase for the trip - everyone needed a sleeping bag, a place in a tent, a backpack for clothes and part of food, various equipment and kitchen utensils.  Since the food had to be cooked on the spot, a huge stock of cereals, stews, spices, dry soups and other delicacies were divided into all.  It is easier to carry and losing / spoiling is more difficult.  But these are all ordinary tourist moments, familiar to everyone who has ever gone hiking.  Therefore, we will not focus on them, and move on to the photo.  One thing I will definitely mention is that the main high-tech device for you should be a satellite phone, and better two, different systems.  And to him it is desirable to organize charging from solar panels, supplemented by a battery pack in case of bad weather.  If suddenly something goes wrong, by phone you can contact the rescuers, well, just spread a word with your family if you get bored.  We had two phones, Globalstar and Iridium.  Only Iridium worked on Lake Lama, this was basically enough.  It will also be useful GPS-navigator with counters of heights, distance and other utilities.  But enough of the text, go to the photo. <br><br>  Norilsk Airport.  Of course, we knew that billions of biting insects would not wait for us, but the meeting with them happened all of a sudden, right on leaving the plane. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/4c1/2aa/7db/4c12aa7db4374bd41e3bc001549f71a9.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Luggage looks compact, but external lightness is deceptive.  Backpacks girls weigh under twenty, men - over twenty, sometimes far. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/0e3/551/75f/0e355175f28141f705ef5cc90fa3f901.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  We waited for a minibus and set off.  Morning meets us cool ... <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/04f/bba/9c2/04fbba9c21eacfbd327203d9dcc2295a.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Picturesque landscapes of Norilsk and environs.  In other parts we will show Norilsk at night.  More precisely, at night during the polar day. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/704/f4a/24d/704f4a24d3d18ddee74913a561e1edc2.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/9da/419/8c4/9da4198c473d3e391ae76041efbe6865.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  From the Ministry of Emergency Situations, where it was necessary to call in person, we arrived at the boat station, where a pre-ordered boat was waiting for us.  Loading took place quickly, and literally half an hour later we hit the road.  About an hour passed along the Norilsk River and finally reached the wide water, into the lake. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/3aa/842/02b/3aa84202bc40e4bbdabfe668a943425a.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/45b/e48/e6f/45be48e6fe2d905187f0ce9fc4b96d58.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/502/631/6d2/5026316d280d782f5a79e29b11ed9561.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  We go on the lake.  Open fantastic views. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/755/63f/d88/75563fd88763da57f523523cbd6553da.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/afd/e1f/fb9/afde1ffb9bbd4c97162e8e0a654bf5b6.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/47a/f56/7f9/47af567f96cb1b9f33c3d21548130505.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/27b/099/73c/27b09973ccd9e7567eec57180ac94348.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/2e4/d30/3d8/2e4d303d82ab5b7387b290372bc340ea.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d20/46a/643/d2046a643f2becdc3d5c0a2e494be00b.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The water surface is like a mirror. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/18f/864/9ba/18f8649ba668795ae1e62ac72280faa6.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Visible shadow from the cloud. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/bb6/3f4/41d/bb63f441d3a891180bf9e5843a6a0725.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  More views of the lake.  In general, we are very lucky with sunny days.  Of the 10 days we were at the lake, 7 were warm and sunny.  This is rare, even at the end of July. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e7f/f99/57e/e7ff9957e4eca5b0a8efcfb9066a93b2.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Even at high speed, we managed to attack snapping gadflies (or someone else).  It was necessary to be vigilant, because these brutes need some time to prepare for the bite, and the winged foe can and must be driven away. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/888/32d/6c3/88832d6c37590bf90616e90268de2fab.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Finally, we came to the parking lot.  A sandbar was required, where there is a level place for setting up tents.  There are relatively few of them on the lake.  In addition, on these "beaches" are often a lot of dry branches, made the spring flood. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/5f6/45e/c3d/5f645ec3d824eb71894633e1c579a824.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b7e/bdb/bb8/b7ebdbbb887caa6ceb228bb674186ddc.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The unloading process is in progress. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/6ad/dda/a58/6adddaa5822cfa9870980a3e2b225274.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/598/d2f/624/598d2f6244f85f68fe7457019e38e781.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/7ed/a1f/14a/7eda1f14a4023e14b76e48212e3fd370.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Maxim could not stand it and immediately rushed into the water in a special suit with a fishing rod at the ready. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d87/067/639/d87067639b5bdc277aece6cebfb0778d.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Our captain.  He calmly waited until we unloaded things and set up tents, and then invited me into his cabin, where he poured everyone a pile of arrivals and gave out deer meat cutlets for a snack.  After such an inspiring event, we rushed to swim.  Water is no warmer than eight degrees. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/329/73d/bf3/32973dbf3f5b4e574dbdf6687a22b78d.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/702/44a/6ea/70244a6ea23f45bc24c88c301d67dfca.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Late evening.  The next day we gathered and walked along the coast to the second parking lot.  In the following parts we will try to paint all the pleasures of a hike over rough terrain with a backpack on our back and thousands of hungry mosquitoes around. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/85d/7ef/b35/85d7efb358e466127a33a960b638f673.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The second parking.  Tents right on the surf line. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/921/126/77a/92112677a3ff89677af7bfbdaa6cab32.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/4a2/3b3/668/4a23b3668ee7f5502118922879cf7037.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b7e/bfd/72a/b7ebfd72af59c08e65fc44d26980db96.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  View of the camp.  Smokes a small fire, ripens the soup. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/77a/061/500/77a061500a89b8cb69c2d0252ebfa183.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/3b1/9c4/383/3b19c438349b64163eb21f63de1edce2.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/107/ead/a74/107eada743ffbea7b12caac01e16717a.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Especially for the expedition, we made windbreakers, softshell, T-shirts and FLAG. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/8ef/7d1/a3a/8ef7d1a3a60d011aeccd16434e25a090.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Neighborhood parking.  Mossy cliffs.  When walking in the moss feet fall a little, not very pleasant smelling pollen rises.  Here, in the literal sense of the word, a man‚Äôs foot never stepped. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/71b/395/91b/71b39591bde455b10bdaa4fdadcc073a.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/afb/8ef/107/afb8ef1078977a2c458f8e92db51bd69.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/5ac/2c3/4d7/5ac2c34d71a5d11d7e6da40d9f414258.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/520/63e/027/52063e027b6246d52d0f246d2318ab2e.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/728/077/34d/72807734d81a1936fd163079004b75cc.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Taiga. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/984/fde/44c/984fde44cf778ec94cfeb5c181f3ac42.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/250/ce0/577/250ce057702469300f485da3d1453c32.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c62/30e/7ae/c6230e7ae87ad7ff974604b6671a10b0.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Surf and giant cobblestones.

Two days poured fine nasty rain.  It was decided to move to the next parking lot in a motorboat of a local resident, the secret supervisor of the lake and the owner of a small tourist center.  Once a day he toured the land and immediately asked who we were, where we came from and what we were doing here. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/7be/b44/539/7beb44539792f4d5e59fcefc317fa083.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a0c/182/e3e/a0c182e3ea9236ca8f624028d8ce7726.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/0fd/633/017/0fd633017e359419e29447ac5fdf16f4.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  We move in parts. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a5e/f7b/970/a5ef7b970e78671cefb5eaad172c6380.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  New haven.
