And although the absolute primacy of raising capital in this industry is occupied by Britain, whose companies have received over the past five years investments in the amount of $ 5.4 billion, or 3.5 billion pounds sterling. <br><br>  For comparison, the rest of Europe combined could only reach 4.4 billion dollars.  But nevertheless, the northern countries are not asleep either: Denmark, Sweden, Iceland, Norway and Finland brought their own FINTECH unicorns to the market, the total value of which is estimated at $ 1 billion.
