  <section class="page js-page"><h1>April Fools' draws: how we made a contest</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Dear habrovchane, it's time to reveal the cards: <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/ideco/blog/116620/">the sysadmins competition</a> was comic.  But in every joke there is some truth: all the girls are absolutely real, they agreed to participate, chose a photo, worried about the comments and waited for the results of the competition. <br>  The participant who received the most votes received the crown, bouquet and cake and was pleasantly surprised by the choice of the community.  Prufoto can be seen on <a href="http://missadmin2011.ru/">the competition website</a> . <br>  The competition was born as an idea about 2 weeks before April 1st.  The task is simple: to create news that is interesting not only for our potential customers, but also for the target audience in general. <br>  Under Habrakat I will reveal the secret of statistics, labor costs and the final results of this action. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Experience with <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/i_am_advertising/99167/">Admin Contests</a> is, and rather big - competitions are always interesting, and beauty contests are also spectacular. <br>  Resolved - we are looking for beauties!  As a result, we took part in our competition: a dance instructor, a construction equipment sales manager, an optical fiber network designer, a software sales manager, a young mommy and a professional tailor.  Who is who - guess yourself. <br><br>  Stages: <br><ul><li>  Selection of participants </li><li>  Website layout </li><li>  Testing </li><li>  News launch </li><li>  Statistics collection </li></ul><br><br>  The most difficult thing was to find girls who agreed to such an adventure.  Any competition is always a discussion, and not always in a pleasant way.  Pretenders were found among our friends and acquaintances.  We settled official questions - photos received!

      Everything is clear with the site - we are looking for a programmer who has experience with voting and fighting with vote wrapping.  He also thinks how to authorize users and cut off bots.  As a result, authorization through Vkontakte, Yandex, Gmail and just anonymously linked to the mailbox was in the contest.  There were no special cheats. <br><br>  In parallel, the www.missadmin2011.ru domain is <a href="http://www.missadmin2011.ru/">registered</a> , but for the vigilant habrovchan, the subdomain miss.admin2011.ru, which existed since last year, was used. <br><br>  At the testing stage, we look at what and where can be improved.  Suddenly the idea came to fasten large photos - they did it already on the fly. <br><br>  News: since the morning of April 1, the news began to diverge on topical online media.  Magazines do not disturb, so as not to interfere with the joke with the truth.  In the morning the post on Habr√© was published, until 13-00 it was only in the corporate blog.  About statistics and traffic sources - below. <br>  At this stage there was an unexpected surprise: hosting let us down.  The first fall of the site happened at about 7 thousand visitors, before the appearance of habra effect.  It turned out that the stream was not delivered by the <b>channel</b> , but not by the server.  According to the latest information, they, too, Ddos overtook.  Pechalka, urgently moving to a spare airfield in Germany. <br><br>  <b>Contest statistics</b> <br>  The competition attracted about 12 thousand visitors, 40 thousand views. <br>  According to the traffic sources, I would certainly like to mention Habrahabr as a clear leader in terms of quantity (and quality) - 5400 visitors. <br>  Further, it is also a very juicy and tasty resource - <a href="http://opennet.ru/">http://opennet.ru</a> , 1700 guests. <br>  Portals <a href="http://news.ferra.ru/">http://news.ferra.ru</a> and <a href="http://linux.org.ru/">http://linux.org.ru</a> performed well. <br>  Good results are also in the relevant forums for system administrators - but we already knew that. <br><br>  Transitions to our site: there are about 800 of them, good. <br><br>  Visitors would be 30% more if not for problems with hosting. <br><br>  <b>Lessons for the future:</b> <br>  Have you checked everything?  Check again!  Nobody was waiting for problems from the hosting where the contests were already held.  And it was necessary only to check the bandwidth of the channel. <br>  Photographer, make-up artist and studio need to prepare in advance.  Natural photos they, of course, prove vitality and all that, but the winner deserved to look beautiful. <br>  It is necessary, it is necessary to hold a real competition.  Male, with sweaters and cats: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/478/0ba/d9d/4780bad9dbcd016438455e1e4bbb08a1.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  I am pleased to answer questions from colleagues and interested. <br><br>  <i>PS Of course, this article was supposed to appear on April 4, but the lack of karma made some corrections.</i> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/116959/">https://habr.com/ru/post/116959/</a></p>
