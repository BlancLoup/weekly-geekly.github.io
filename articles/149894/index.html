  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Auto Acceleration - a project for car enthusiasts</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  There is one good principle for a person who wants to take something such, and to do so in such a way that the general public is interested in his creation: do only what you will use yourself.  I had a desire to implement some project for Android ten minutes after finding a smartphone with this OS.  But I have always respected this principle, so ideas were rigorously selected and eliminated as unnecessary. <br><br>  In addition to the smartphone, I still have a car, and it appeared much earlier.  You can safely write me to car enthusiasts.  Several times I had a desire to measure the real time of acceleration to 100 km / h of my car.  It was not strong enough to buy additional devices, to figure it out - and I just took a stopwatch, looked at the speedometer and got some figure.  True, the speedometer was lying, from different angles it looked different, the arrow crawled not so fast to clearly fix the moment of reaching the desired mark.  Having gotten the phone, I started looking for an application on the market for such a measurement.  After all, for iOS there is a very famous program of such a plan!  But this is a story about our program, so let it remain a nameless competitor.  Of course, I found the applications, but I didn‚Äôt like them.  And it was decided: I will do it myself, for myself.  In the course of development I had two interesting ideas that I liked so much that the partners were invited.  And so, on 07/30/2012, the draft was published.  Then I will briefly talk about what was invented, what came out of it, and what are the future plans ... <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  <b>First, a little about technology.</b>  All the programs that I looked at on the market worked at that time exclusively with an accelerometer.  There was some use of GPS, but not at all popular.  I immediately had the idea to build a graph of acceleration, with GPS delays it would be impossible.  It was decided to use an accelerometer. <br>  A lot of races were held, connected friends of engineers, physicists, mathematicians - an error of 5-10% was almost always present.  And with particularly evil bumps - the measurement was far from reality.  This did not suit me, and the idea came number one: to combine the untimely incoming, but fairly accurate data from the GPS receiver, with instantly received data from the accelerometer, containing an accumulating error.  On long winter evenings, we sat looking at the graphics, thinking up how to combine the not quite compatible.  As a result, a concept was invented, which was carried out empirically.  There is no higher mathematics or quantum physics - everything is quite simple and even boring, so I will not describe the details here.  But I began to like the result obtained in this way, and besides, there was an opportunity to sift out obviously incorrect experiments with these very pits, slides, elevation differences, and the like.  At that time, no competing application claimed a similar method.  And now there is a feeling that many use the accelerometer to capture the starting point, and GPS to determine the speed.

      At some point it was thought that it would be interesting to collect statistics of measurements on different cars, different years, in different places.  After all, the manufacturer‚Äôs data are some figures obtained (received?) Under ideal conditions on a new car.  From this interest, an obvious idea is to create a web resource to collect information about user measurements, with the ability to search by it, study statistics, etc.  The most pleasant thing was that I did not find a single analogue.  Maybe he was looking bad, of course - but he still did not come across.  Borrowing ideas is good, but a new idea is even better. <br><br>  <b>What happened since the start.</b> <br>  Since we were not funded by anyone, nobody canceled the main work - the project was done for quite a long time, but three weeks ago it saw the light.  To alert people about it, several automotive forums and the 4PDA resource were used.  To be honest, I didn‚Äôt really hope for serious popularity.  The more pleasant is the fact that after a few days the application was included in the ‚ÄúTop New Free‚Äù column on Google Play, displacing erotic Chinese crafts and other strange trash.  And the web site on the best of days scored more than 10,000 views.  Motorists turned out to be a loyal public, and the app received a lot of good marks.  Of course, there were negative reviews.  This is inevitable: firstly, if you violate the test procedure, you will definitely get an incorrect result, and what could be simpler than saying ‚ÄúYour program does not work‚Äù.  In addition, the variety of devices on the market does not allow to assert that the application works correctly on any device.  But what pleases: among the measurements uploaded to the site, more than 90% seem to be quite adequate.  Unfortunately, there are far fewer downloads to the site than the program downloads: maybe users just don‚Äôt want to mess around with it.  But anyway, I can confidently say: our program works, but there are always exceptions. <br><br>  <b>About the application itself.</b>  In no case do I want to add a lot of letters to this article, diluting it with instructions, weight of pictures, a description of why we need a service, etc.  In this section I will be brief, the details are on the project website. <br><br>  Here is the application: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/cb1/b36/0e2/cb1b360e2ab0f9625f59b73c2eeedfea.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Here is what you can see on the site: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/2a6/9b2/10f/2a69b210fc8c6f928d63deb67713275a.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  But what a project can be useful for the car enthusiast.  After, of course, the main reason to use it is for fun. <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ Measurement of acceleration time in order to compare with passport data <br>  ‚Ä¢ Measurement in order to compare with data of other users with the same cars <br>  ‚Ä¢ Measurement for the purpose of analyzing manual gear shifting by the driver <br>  ‚Ä¢ Measurement before and after repair or tuning to assess the effect <br>  ‚Ä¢ Viewing statistics on the car brand of interest when choosing a car <br><br>  <b>We have a lot of plans for the development of the project.</b>  The most obvious is an extension to other mobile platforms: Windows Phone and iOS.  The site also requires serious redesign and functional refinement.  The main idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe application is its simplicity and conciseness.  However, there are a number of options that should be added: and a 402 meter race, and a display of the current speed, etc.  Investments in project promotion would also be helpful.  The main question is whether the service will be in demand in runet.  If yes - nothing prevents to do the same in the world market.  At the moment, the project is damp, it is rather a ‚Äúpilot‚Äù.  Therefore, it is not necessary, probably, to treat him too meticulously.  We would like you to appreciate first of all the idea itself, on the way of realization of which there is no limit to perfection. <br><br>  Thanks for attention. <br><br>  <b>References</b> <br>  <a href="http://mycaracc.ru/">Link to the project website</a> <br>  <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details%3Fid%3Dmycaracc.CarAccRus">Link to Google Play</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/149894/">https://habr.com/ru/post/149894/</a></p>
