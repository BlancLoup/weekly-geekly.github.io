    <h3>  <font color="#0071c5">Buzz Feed CEO John Peretti sleeps until 8:30 am</font> </h3><br>  In ordinary life, 8.30 means ‚Äúsleep time‚Äù, but in the context of business, this is the second half of the day.  Peretti - who founded The HuffingtonPost - destroys the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãhis morning routine.  He says that he usually sleeps at 8:30.  Then he looks at a business or sports column in the New York Times (his wife only allows him two columns), grabs a magazine and heads for the metro. <br><br><h3>  <font color="#0071c5">Writer Katherine Schulz creates her best work in the middle of the night.</font> </h3><br>  Schultz can hardly be called the first writer who is on the rise, when everyone around him has dreams.  But she is not necessarily happy about it.  ‚ÄúI sometimes think that I would give everything to be a‚Äú morning person, ‚Äùshe writes. <br><br>  At about 10 pm Schultz seemed to lose her writing abilities ... And only after 3 in the morning can she work. <br><blockquote>  ‚ÄúIf you put off work and go to bed, I instantly fall asleep.  I can wake up and function again about nine! ‚Äù </blockquote><br><h3>  <font color="#0071c5">Mayor of New York, Bill de Blasio, not the "Lark"</font> </h3><br>  The mayor, who is known for his late arrival, was frank about his perfect schedule.  "I am not a morning person," he once admitted in his election campaign. <br><blockquote>  ‚ÄúI think we should reorient our society to go to bed late, but this is hardly happening right now.‚Äù </blockquote><br>  Although the schedule of Blascio, including his often discussed exercises in the gym at 9 am, is hardly unheard of, he is far from the programs of his recent predecessors.  Bloomberg was known for jogging at 5 am, and Giuliani held meetings with his staff at 8 am.  Indeed, <a href="http://testutor.ru/blog/dvenadcat-sposobov-perestat-otnositsya-k-sebe-slishkom-surovo/">why be too harsh to yourself</a> ? <br><br><h3>  <font color="#0071c5">Comedian and Daily Show presenter Trevor Noa wakes up at 6 pm</font> </h3><br>  Comedians are known for their "owl" schedules - this is part of their work, but even by these standards, Noah's schedule is extreme.  As he says Jerry Saynfelda in the episode "Comedians Drive a Car and Drink Coffee," his morning begins at 6 pm. <br><br>  He wakes up, reads the news, takes a shower and gets dressed.  Then he goes to work, which usually begins around 7 pm. <br><br><h3>  <font color="#0071c5">Former Prime Minister of England, Winston Churchill, preferred to manage affairs in bed</font> </h3><br>  Note that Churchill was not a classic "owl" - he woke up at 7:30 in the morning - and usually did not get up from bed until 11. After waking up, he had breakfast in bed, read mail and all national newspapers.  After that, while still in bed, he began his working day, communicating with his secretaries.  Before you take a bath, which could be delayed until noon.  Yes, <a href="http://testutor.ru/blog/9-kommunikativnyx-navykov-kotorymi-dolzhen-obladat-lyuboj-uspeshnyj-lider/">the leaders could learn a lot</a> ! <br><br><h3>  <font color="#0071c5">BOX CEO, Aaron Levy, looks through his mail in bed</font> </h3><br>  The CEO of the file synchronization company wakes up at 10 am and, following the example of great people such as Churchill, begins his day with comfort. <br><br>  ‚ÄúI know that this is not the best practice,‚Äù admits Levi Fast Company.  However, he scans the email and stays in bed for about 30 minutes reading, replying and deleting letters. <br><blockquote>  "I have to be sure that I will not have unread letters left by the time I enter the office ..." </blockquote><br><h3>  <font color="#0071c5">Novelist Cynthia Ozik lets her day begin when it begins</font> </h3><br>  "I almost never return home at midnight," said novelist Cynthia Osik, who was awarded the Booker Prize, in an interview with The Paris Review in 1985. <br><blockquote>  "I always leave the party last ..." </blockquote><br>  The very idea of ‚Äã‚Äã"working graphics" seemed to make her laugh.  ‚ÄúYou speak as if there is a predictable schedule.  I have no work schedule.  I wake up late.  I read mail.  Sometimes this is a very complicated procedure. ‚Äù <br><br><h3>  <font color="#0071c5">Gustave Flaubert called his servants at 10 am</font> </h3><br>  Flaubert, author of Madame Bovary, began his day at 10:00 (according to Mason Kerry's Daily Rituals). <br>  After awakening, he called for the servants to bring him newspapers, mail, a glass of cold water and a filled pipe.  When he was full, he called his mother so that she, sitting on the bed, would talk with him until he decided to get up. <br><br><h3>  <font color="#0071c5">Reddit co-founder, Alexis Ohanian, uses his cat as an alarm clock.</font> </h3><br>  ‚ÄúI‚Äôm usually always late,‚Äù says Ohanian Fast Company.  Yes, he does not lie in bed until 2 o'clock in the afternoon and tries to start awake by 10 am. <br><br>  Then Alexis does things of paramount importance.  ‚ÄúThe first thing I do is take a bath.  Then I make coffee, ‚Äùhe says.  And then he corrects himself: ‚ÄúNo, the first thing I do is feed the cat, because it always wakes me up!‚Äù <br><br><h3>  <font color="#0071c5">James Joyce lay "shrouded in his thoughts" until 11 am</font> </h3><br>  Like Flaubert and Box's CEO, Aaron Levy, the legendary modernist woke up around 10 am (according to Kerry's Daily Rituals, again). <br><br>  Then, according to his biographer Richard Ellman, Joyce "sipped coffee and ate buns."  Then he lay, ‚Äúwrapped in his own thoughts,‚Äù until 11. Sometimes these thoughts were interrupted by the arrival of his ‚ÄúPolish tailor‚Äù.  He talked about the cut, and Joyce listened and nodded. <br><br><h3>  <font color="#0071c5">The co-founder and CEO of Genius, Tom Lehman, usually sleeps from 3:00 to 10:30</font> </h3><br>  In an interview with Lifehacker, Lehman, CEO Genius acknowledges that he is not an "early bird."  ‚ÄúBut, if it so happened that I woke up early, and, especially, if I go to the gym, I will tell everyone about it,‚Äù he adds. <br><br>  Also in the morning he is sure to read Hacker News and Twitter, considering it a true pleasure. <br><br><h3>  <font color="#0071c5">Musician, philanthropist and entrepreneur Farrell Williams leaves bed at 9:00 (without alarm)</font> </h3><br>  William, Grammy winner, fashion designer, music producer, textile manufacturer (he is a partner in Bionic Yarn (bionic yarn)), a philanthropist and tycoon, according to Fast Company, starts his day at a very reasonable time - at 9 am. <br><br>  ‚ÄúThe first thing I do is thank the Lord,‚Äù he says.  Then he goes to the shower, where, as he confesses, many thoughts visit him, and also he sometimes writes songs there.  If Williams is late somewhere, it's not because of traffic jams, but because of the shower. <br><br><h3>  <font color="#0071c5">Gertrude Stein woke up at 10:00 and drank coffee "against the will"</font> </h3><br>  The writer and poetess is a diehard night owl.  She woke up at 10 am and reluctantly drank a cup of coffee.  Coffee has always annoyed her.  But this was the appointment of a doctor. <br><br><h3>  <font color="#0071c5">Fashion designer Karl Lagerfeld, despite everything, sleeps 7 hours a day</font> </h3><br>  The ‚Äúking of fashion‚Äù is a man who wakes up only when he has received at least seven hours of sound sleep. <br>  ‚ÄúIf I go to bed at two, I wake up at nine,‚Äù he explained to Harper's Bazaar.  ‚ÄúIf I go to bed at midnight, I wake up at seven.  I do not sleep until the last, but I sleep for seven hours! ‚Äù <br><br>  To get the most from sleep, he puts on a long, white poplin shirt, created especially for him. <br><br><h3>  <font color="#0071c5">Painter Jackson Pollock started his day with a cigarette at 13:00</font> </h3><br>  ‚ÄúI have an old habit of sleeping all day and working all night,‚Äù he told a journalist in 1950. <br><br>  According to Kerry's Daily Rituals, Pollock slept (with his phone turned off so no one would disturb him) until 1:00 pm  When he woke up, he usually had breakfast (coffee and a cigarette) and went to the barn to draw until 6 pm, until it was time for a walk with his wife, artist Lee Krasner. <br><br>  PS We recommend another useful article on the topic of working on yourself - <a href="http://testutor.ru/blog/10-potryasayushhix-biznes-urokov-ot-izvestnogo-predprinimatelya/">Ten amazing business lessons from a famous entrepreneur</a> . <br><br>  The author of the translation is Vyacheslav Davidenko, the founder of the <a href="http://testutor.ru/">TESTutor</a> company. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/300182/">https://habr.com/ru/post/300182/</a></p>
