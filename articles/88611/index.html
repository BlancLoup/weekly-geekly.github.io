  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Treasury providers</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  In order to present the situation with the Internet in Kazakhstan in the most complete and realistic way, I think the most important thing to start is to provide information about what kind of Internet is there.  There are relatively few analytical data and comparisons of Internet providers in Kazakhstan, so I decided to correct the situation and bring to the attention of habra people data on the cost and quality of Internet connections in Kazakhstan. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  In this article, only data on providers providing access for home users over the wire will be considered, I think about providers for business customers should write a separate post and on wireless too.

      First you need to find out.  How many people in Kazakhstan have access to the Internet?  Data from different sources is very different, as usual.  The figures are 1, 2 and even 3 million, which is one fifth of all the inhabitants of the country.  But in reality, in practice, a tenth of the population most likely has permanent home access.  1.5 million people. <br><br>  The figure is considerable and has a tendency to constant and steady growth. <br><br>  Prices in the article will be indicated in Kazakhstan tenge.  For simplicity, we assume that 1 Russian ruble is equal to 5 Kazakhstan tenge.  Although in reality tenge is slightly more expensive. <br><br>  So let's get started.  Let's start with the largest and most popular ISP. <br><br><h4>  Kazakhtelecom JSC </h4><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/38/eb/38eba175939b4f899324fdb0af35ce28.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Kazakhtelecom is the oldest and most popular provider in Kazakhstan.  This is due to many factors: <br><br>  Firstly, almost all home telephones in Kazakhstan are connected through it and makes it possible with little effort to provide everyone with access to ADSL.  Also, in those places where ADSL is unavailable there is an opportunity to connect via Dial-Up through its own services ‚ÄúInternet Zone‚Äù and ‚ÄúKazakhstan Internet‚Äù.  You can familiarize yourself with the tariffs for Dial-Up <a href="http://telecom.kz/index.php%3Fuin%3D1235013714%26actn%3Dhome%26lang%3Drus">here</a> , but we will consider only access via dedicated lines. <br><br>  Kazakhtelecom provides access to ADSL under the brand name "Megaline".  This is the most popular connection method in Kazakhstan; in fact, most people associate the Internet with the word ‚ÄúMegaline‚Äù.  On March 2, 2010, a half-million Megaline user was registered. <br><br>  Many Megaline tariff plans give users the opportunity to choose the most suitable, but the most popular of all tariff plans is the ‚ÄúMegaline Hit‚Äù.  More information about the cost of tariff plans can be found <a href="http://megaline.kz/ru/rates/">here</a> .  There are both unlimited and tariff plans with prepaid traffic. <br><br>  To understand the Kazakhstan market of Internet access it is very important to understand one thing.  Kazakhtelecom is a monopolist in the market of Internet access services.  At the time of the appearance of Megaline, it was decided that the traffic for users of Kazakhtelecom would not be taken into account.  That is, within Kazakhstan, it creates its own intranet.  Simply put, all users of Megaline are connected to one huge Kazakhstan-wide LAN. <br><br>  The decision was in my opinion correct and prompted the developers to use Kazakhtelecom servers to host their sites.  Inside the network there are video services, torrent trackers, and other sites that consume a lot of traffic. <br><br>  For example, I have Megaline Turbo Plus.  The access speed on this tariff plan is 8 Mbps.  Traffic limit is 20 GB.  This means that I can download 20 GB from resources outside the network of JSC Kazakhtelecom.  And within the network - I can download as much as you like.  By accessing Youtube, Habr, and so on, I spend external traffic.  By accessing <a href="http://kiwi.kz/">Kiwi.kz</a> , <a href="http://yvision.kz/">Yvision.kz</a> traffic for me is not taken into account and I can watch as many videos as I like, download files, watch photos.  Such a policy brought its results and a huge number of sites similar to those outside the internal network began to appear in Kaznet.  If 3 years ago there were almost no services inside Kaznet, now, you can find a replacement for almost any external service. <br><br>  For many, the word Kaznet and the internal network of Kazakhtelecom JSC - the words are synonyms and the unrecorded traffic for megalineers has become a sacred cow.  A recommendation to all Runet planners who plan to come to Kaznet with their projects - take into account the peculiarities of the local market - pay homage to the sacred cow and place the servers within the network of Kazakhtelecom JSC. <br><br>  In addition to the fact that traffic to internal resources is not taken into account, there is another feature - it is served at a higher speed (approximately two times higher than the speed that is supplied from external resources), depending on the chosen tariff plan.  In this case, even if you run out of traffic.  That is, you have exhausted the resource given to you for a month, you have the opportunity to use internal resources.  This makes the Megaline connection an ideal connection option. <br><br>  Consider the <a href="http://megaline.kz/ru/rates/hit/">most popular tariff plan</a> in order to have an idea about the average Kazakhstan user. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/25/65/2565bc5d362083cf266a48907310c6d7.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  That is, if you live in Almaty and you have a Megaline Hit, you get Megabit for external resources and 2 Mb / s for internal resources for 4,260 tenge (about 1000 rubles). <br><br>  For those who want to learn more about the tariffs on the Megaline <a href="http://megaline.kz/ru/rates/compare/">link</a> . <br><br>  <a href="http://telecom.kz/">JSC Kazakhtelecom</a> . <br>  <a href="http://megaline.kz/">Megaline</a> . <br><br><h4>  ALMA TV </h4><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/60/e5/60e59e9a1d4bbdc0826c60bb4ae3ea4e.gif" alt="image"><br><br>  Began to provide access to the Internet not so long ago (2 years ago) The connection is via a Television cable and is available for subscribers of Almat-TV cable television. <br><br>  There are three tariff plans: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/bc/bc/bcbca5e205b075900594fd7d9c8399db.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  More information about the tariffs can be found <a href="http://almatv.kz/t_internet.php">here</a> . <br><br><h4>  Beeline </h4><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/89/de/89de176a1eb835644b671933c8262cad.gif" alt="image"><br><br>  This year another provider has entered the market with very big ambitions.  Access is still provided in the western part of the city of Almaty, but Internet prices give reason to believe that it will be in great demand among users. <br><br>  There are only two tariff plans: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/88/ef/88efc78ab32a8c2653ec4748a3a8095f.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Connection is via Ethernet.  The speed judging by the reviews is good.  Naturally, like any novice provider, there are problems with support and service. <br><br>  More details on rates <a href="">here</a> . <br><br><h4>  Icon </h4><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/43/82/4382c74abc21091aab5f6aa0e215ff0a.gif" alt="image"><br><br>  Another cable TV player who decided that he should try himself in the Internet service. <br><br>  Connects to ICON television subscribers, via a television cable. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/d5/89/d5891fbe234248453ebc8d693a8dce83.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <a href="http://www.iconnet.kz/index.html%3Fid%3D24">Rates</a> . <br><br><h4>  2DAY Telecom </h4><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/8a/c2/8ac2219c1d18613d6ce4938f73e0c17d.gif" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/c2/1d/c21dd0d7548c319b01cf49210fc875d7.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <a href="http://www.2day.kz/chastnye_tarify_na_internet">Rates</a> . <br><br>  I think this can be completed, because the other providers are not so large and do not occupy any significant market share. <br><br>  For those who are interested in providers of Kazakhstan, I recommend the site <a href="http://www.provider.kz/">provider.kz</a> , which presents almost all providers in the Republic of Kazakhstan. <br><br>  PS This post does not pretend to a deep market research, but is intended to orient and familiarize the community about the realities of Kaznet users. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/88611/">https://habr.com/ru/post/88611/</a></p>
