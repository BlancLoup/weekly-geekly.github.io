      The length of the model is 10 cm., The weight with the battery is 40 grams. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/ad3/250/e8d/ad3250e8d5f85df483de9368835664cc.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Despite such small dimensions, the dNaNo chassis has a design that is used in larger cars.  DNaNo has front spring shock absorbers, satellite differential, rear suspension shock absorber, etc.  The car has a proportional control of two channels (gas-brake and turning the wheels right-left).  Many car components can be replaced or tuned.  The dNaNo transmitter operates in the 2.4GHz frequency range and is powered by four rechargeable batteries or AAA batteries.  The dNaNo chassis is powered by a Lithium Polymer 3.7V 130mAh battery, which lasts for 15-20 minutes of active driving.  The model's speed in the basic configuration is <b>13-15 km / h</b> .  A microchip is built into the model to determine the lap time on the track, but a device for reading the result (serif) must be purchased separately. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/b34/614/616/b3461461637851d1d68e405720099541.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h4>  <b>Contents of delivery</b> </h4><br><br>  When buying dNaNo you should pay attention to the fact that the chassis with the body comes separately from the control equipment.  Transmitter, batteries, charger must be purchased separately. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/a5e/209/e98/a5e209e9832a081d0788132d03cb9fe3.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The universal dNaNo transmitter can be used to control a <a href="http://zino.habrahabr.ru/blog/63060/">Mini-Z</a> series radio-controlled car model with electronics operating in the 2.4GHz frequency band. <br><br><h4>  <b>Varieties dNaNo</b> </h4><br><br>  Today, there are 3 types of dNaNo chassis, which differ from each other in the engine relative to the differential: <br><br>  <b>MM</b> - the motor is located in front of the differential axis <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/6e6/077/0b5/6e60770b55e059d58f4e7a341cfa97d7.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <b>RM</b> - the motor is located behind the axis of the differential <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/ce5/7b0/fe0/ce57b0fe06a28d08b66b8f8f667d6043.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <b>HM</b> motor is located above the axle of the differential <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/73f/4ba/cd7/73f4bacd737454661b1aa7afb17ebc44.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h4>  <b>DNaNo design</b> </h4><br><br>  In front of the chassis housing is a servo mechanism, which with the help of a steel steering rack turns two cams on which the front wheels are fastened with very small screws.  Tires from rubber are put on rims. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/c58/b65/4ba/c58b654bafb7229c317022da89a8dc54.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Inside the dNaNo case there is a receiver with a speed controller on a single board.  Outside the case, connectors for connecting the engine, gyroscope (purchased separately) and the connector for programming dNaNo electronics via a computer are displayed. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/30c/303/002/30c30300298cbaf8b46ca7ffa8ff62ae.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  programming device and software sold separately <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/c57/2c2/c44/c572c2c44cb18701947d6a19587b3263.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  A removable Lithium-polymer battery in a plastic shock-proof casing is located under the chassis cover. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/072/731/e3d/072731e3d6c0b3f2d9973737136e91e2.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  By means of a flexible plate, the rear suspension is attached to the chassis body - the engine mount.  The flexible mounting plate is the rear suspension shock absorber. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/b65/167/320/b6516732047150e328ec2352023a8ecc.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  In the motor-frame there is a collector electric motor, on which shaft the driving gear from Delrin is put on.  Included dNaNo are 4 gears (6,7,8,9 teeth), which can be changed.  The differential is inserted into the holes of the plastic bushings on the motor mount.  The rear wheels are mounted on the differential with small screws. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/c7c/b6f/777/c7cb6f777ecaf14f093755106ea69ad4.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  At the bottom of the case there is a unique blue chip with an RFID tag to determine the time it takes for the race to go.  The device (notch) for reading the information of the RFID tag installed on the dNaNo case is a flat antenna of wires that is placed under the track and connected to the computer.  The notch for dNaNo is only available from Kyosho and must be purchased separately. <br><br><h4>  <b>DNaNo body</b> </h4><br><br>  The body for dNaNo is made of durable plastic, painted and varnished.  The laudable copy of the body in no way increases the weight and does not reduce its strength.  Some of the body look more reliable counterparts.  Kyosho company has the right to accurately copy the symbols and appearance of the most famous cars in the world, thanks to arrangements with the automakers.  Currently, the company has already released the bodywork Audi, Ferrari, Lamborghini, Lancia, Mazda, McLaren, Mitsubishi, Nissan, Porsche, Subaru.  Kyosho expands the dNaNo body collection every month. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/25e/853/b87/25e853b879f0482a84ea8169a1c17ded.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  You can get acquainted with the full collection of today's dNaNo models available <a href="http://www.mini-z.ru/collection_dnano/">here.</a> <br><br><h4>  <b>Transmitter to control dNaNo</b> </h4><br><br>  DNaNo is controlled by a two-channel ‚Äúpistol-type‚Äù transmitter - the Perfex KT-18. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/dfc/6e7/d27/dfc6e7d276d8d2e51d9550b4c54a8d62.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The transmitter operates in the 2.4GHz frequency range.  The remote control is usually held in the left hand.  Use the index finger of the left hand to pull the trigger, which is responsible for the Gas, Brake and Reverse model.  The steering wheel is turned by the right hand on the remote, which is responsible for turning the model to the left or to the right.  There is an antenna, a switch button and a model trimming button on the console (fine tuning of the angles of rotation of the wheels, and adjustment of the gas and brake modes).  At the bottom of the handle of the remote there is a compartment for four batteries or AA-size batteries.  To control dNaNo, you can use transmitters from other manufacturers <a href="http://www.mini-z.ru/apparatura-dlya-upravleniya-mini-z-i-dnano/">... more</a> <br><br><h4>  <b>Tuning dNaNo</b> </h4><br><br>  Instead of parts that are installed on the standard dNaNo, you can purchase optional (tuning) parts that can drastically change the characteristics of the model.  With the help of tuning parts, dNaNo can be turned into a sports model, which can compete on the track with larger scale models (for example: <a href="http://zino.habrahabr.ru/blog/63060/">Mini-Z</a> ).  Tuning parts are available both from Kyosho and other manufacturers. <br><br><br><br>  With the help of an optional XSpeed ‚Äã‚Äãengine, model speed can be increased one and a half to two times. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/366/476/ab5/366476ab52fc688cf38219b475930ce5.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Using the optional ball differential, you can more flexibly adjust the dynamics of the model during acceleration.  With the help of carbon mount plates for motor mount of different stiffness, you can adjust the damping of the rear hang.  Optional springs with different stiffness allow you to change the degree of depreciation of the front suspension.  dNaNo is a fairly high-speed model, which is very difficult to manage when reaching maximum speed.  To increase the stability of the model on straight sections of the route, it makes sense to purchase a gyroscope, which is connected to a special connector on the chassis body.  To increase chassis reliability, it is possible to purchase an optional mount for turning cams and rims with mounting from aluminum.  Ball bearings can be installed instead of plastic sleeves.  To increase the adhesion of the coated model, you can buy rubber tires with different stiffness. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/65512/">https://habr.com/ru/post/65512/</a></p>
