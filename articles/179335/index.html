  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Stop solving global problems!</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  ‚ÄúWould you like to make more money?‚Äù, ‚ÄúIs it difficult to hire people?‚Äù, ‚ÄúOverwhelmed by mail?‚Äù, ‚ÄúDo you want to improve your health and form?‚Äù <br><br>  Of course, most people will answer these questions with a ‚Äúyes‚Äù.  These are truisms.  Global problems.  And they are not solvable. <br><br>  <b>In many startups, global vision (big vision) and attempts to solve universal problems are confused</b> .  Global vision is important.  It is necessary to set high, noble goals aimed at changing the world.  But, if you say that you solve global problems, you most likely do not understand the real problems. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Communicating with potential customers, startup founders make a mistake when they start with questions that have only one answer.  When they hear it, they use it as a reason for their decision.

      Founder of a startup: ‚ÄúIs it difficult to find talented people in a team?‚Äù <br>  Potential customer: "Yes, it is very difficult." <br>  The founder of the startup: ‚ÄúSo I knew!  And I have the perfect solution for you. ‚Äù <br><br>  It turns out like this: ‚ÄúA big obvious problem (common truth) ... Our solution ... Win!‚Äù <br><br>  But so do not achieve anything.  All real problems, complex tasks (and opportunities!) Are in dots. <br><br>  It is useless to ask such questions, they will not help startups to identify the most painful problems of clients (and this should be done).  The real problems are buried much deeper, in nuances and specificity.  Let's look at these universal truths like "I want to improve my health and form." <br><br>  <i>What is the real problem here?</i>  For example, in a lack of time.  But, this may not be concrete enough.  Most people have free half an hour every day, but they still don‚Äôt do the exercises.  Maybe people are embarrassed to go to the gym and practice with other people?  Or feel uncomfortable in the locker room?  Or they do not know what needs to be done and what will suit them?  Or maybe all taken together for some people and something else for others? <br><br>  You need to thoroughly understand the problems of your consumers, as if by layer-by-layer peeling the onion, until you reach the root.  By asking yes / no questions, especially those where the same answers are expected from everyone, you will not learn anything useful. <br><br>  <b>Secondly, your jumps into the unknown are so significant that it is impossible to predict all the upcoming insights that suddenly hit in the head</b> .  Even if you yourself are working in this area and are familiar with the subject area, you will surely stumble upon the pitfalls that could be foreseen in advance.  <b>Attempting to solve global problems without analyzing the risks and not filling the ellipsis is a sure way to failure</b> . <br><br>  I wrote above that global problems are not solvable.  This is not entirely true.  They can be solved, but only by deeply understanding consumers: how do they act, buy, what is important to them, what is their problem, etc.  If you are going to solve a big and difficult problem that is really important, then for this you will have to <i>fill all the dots</i> and <i>foresee the subsequent insights</i> .  Do not sell solutions to global problems - sell solutions to their underlying problems that can really help your customers, and over time help you realize a ‚Äúglobal vision‚Äù. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/179335/">https://habr.com/ru/post/179335/</a></p>
