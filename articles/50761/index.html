  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Killing Forum</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  <i>Inspired by the inhuman act that happened yesterday in the Russian WAP community ...</i> <br><br>  Probably all the old mobile phones were known for the WAP-resource of Siemens-Club, in particular its forum.  At one time, in 2005-2006, he was on the first lines of the rankings by attendance, until the moment they stopped producing phones of this brand.  Strangely enough, after this event, the attendance of the resource has dropped, but not very much.  On the other hand, the forum has evolved from a purely technical to a freer one, where issues of already extensive subjects were discussed. <br>  Of course, the backbone of the forum, "techies", remained, but talking already more on an equal footing with noobs (there was no one to pray) ... I referred myself to the oldies, because  communicated there practically from the creation of this forum.  But as they say, there was no sadness ... <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>  It all started around the beginning of 2008, when, due to the perpetual employment of the administration, the forum was almost neglected.  It is rather difficult to follow the whole case (average attendance is more than 200 people online).  A flurry of discontent about such a negligent attitude swept through the forum (in the end, the moderators lacked technically enough buttons to maintain order ‚Äî checked).  And the rescue seems to have come.  It turned out to be a new administrator, and in combination the owner of the domain name.  The order was restored, and at the same time it was said that the forum will soon move to a new software platform, which will allow adding functionality and beautify the life of the forum users.  It seems to be all right, but no one thought that this very move would almost put an end to the community. <br>  The fact is that under the change of the engine was another idea.  The forum was stuck as a community to one of the WAP-social / dating networks.  The domain has changed.  Changed the situation.  Lost files, links to user messages.  Registered pseudonyms of course were given not in favor of the forum.  And also there appeared administrators of the form ‚ÄúWell, hello to you all =)‚Äù (which is quite logical in view of the social nature of the resource), but not in any way compatible with the technical topic of the forum.  Of course, most users are unhappy with this.  Totally displeased.  Up to the moderator staff.  One day after the ‚Äúrelocation‚Äù this community lost, probably, 40% of the audience sitting at the old club.  And I think the trend will continue.

      How can I exchange the oldest technical forum for a social network?  Together with the domain.  I do not understand.  I believe that this is disrespect for the permanent audience of the resource, operating by users only as a means of raising the TIC and the lines in the rating. <br><br>  What do you think? <br><br>  <i>-------------------------------------------</i> <br>  <i>Most likely this post can be classified as "trash", but just boiling over.</i> <habracut><br><br>  <b>UPD: the</b> administration now promises to return the domain name though.
