Or a proven way to spoil relationships</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  I will begin the story fairly standardly: ‚ÄúAs one friend of mine told me ...‚Äù <br>  In general, the IT world is quite small, so when a project arises and there is a shortage of our own resources, or simply to order something if necessary, we all first of all remember our friends who could help with this.  Why acquaintances?  Because initially it already defines a certain degree of trust and a more preferential mode of cooperation. <br>  How it ends and what to look for so that it does not end there, I wanted to talk about that. <a name="habracut"></a><br>  If the transaction is a simple type of sale, then, as a rule, everyone is satisfied.  One got a little cheaper or a little faster, the other got a little more than a little more, or waited a bit with payment.  In general, there is a measured civilized life. <br>  But the word ‚Äúproject‚Äù appeared on the horizon ... there was a smell in the air with money, work and something else ... <br>  Today, I assume that you, my dear habragchitchitel, act as a contractor, which is being customized by an acquaintance. <br>  I will try to explain what is generally not a secret, but many regularly overlook this in the name of good relations.  As I was recently convinced, this life experience, imbued with tears, then with the blood of the Performers, must be translated into commandments.  If someone adds the commandments or offers a replacement - it will be just fine. <br><br>  To simplify, I‚Äôll just say that I use the high term <b>‚Äúfriendship‚Äù</b> as a substitute for the term <b>‚Äúgood business or friendship‚Äù</b> , because every time I write such a bunch of words I‚Äôm too lazy, and you‚Äôll be bored to read.  In addition, friendship, like love, often require completely irrational, illogical actions and completely non-commercial business. <br><br>  So, let's begin. <br>  <b>The first commandment:</b> <br>  Do not overestimate the "friendship." <br>  There is always a certain threshold of losses that you are ready to take in order to preserve ‚Äúfriendship.‚Äù  Such an assessment becomes the cornerstone around which further actions are built.  Define this threshold for yourself and remember that your obligations are your obligations, you will have to fulfill them, unlike your partner, who can in some way pump up. <br>  <b>Second Commandment:</b> <br>  Use prepayment. <br>  Nothing strengthens faith in a person and his decency, as payment made on time.  If the project starts, the main issue becomes the question of seriousness of intentions.  As a rule, a symbolic prepayment does not constitute any problem, and if it is, this is another reason to think, maybe you are not the only ‚Äúfriend‚Äù who is digging for free? <br>  <b>The third commandment:</b> <br>  Take care of your time. <br>  Often, ‚Äúparticipation‚Äù in a project begins to accumulate a number of related unpaid advice, confusing communications, and so on.  Remember - your time is not restored. <br>  <b>Fourth Commandment:</b> <br>  Manage communication. <br>  Each action is desirable to make visible, understandable and formal.  The worst that can be "and a week ago you called on the phone ...".  Initially, determine what will be considered an official document - a contract, e-mail or something else.  And then - any call, any discussion should be closed with a letter from your (trust me, this is easier) side with a list of everything that was negotiated and asked to correct if something is wrong.  A day later, you can send the same letter with a note that since no amendments have been received, this letter is the basis for further work. <br>  <b>The fifth commandment:</b> <br>  Assess the risks. <br>  In addition to financial and temporary risks, there are also management risks.  Be careful with them.  If you see weak project management by your partner, you need to reevaluate the feasibility of entering the project.  A friend can be a very good person.  just someone else will use it, but for you the result will be unpleasant. <br>  <b>The sixth commandment:</b> <br>  Stay honest.  Whatever happens, your obligations must be fulfilled to the end.  This does not mean that you have to complete the project free of charge, it means that the promised amount of work must be done.  You made a decision about the acceptable risk - perform. <br>  <b>The seventh commandment:</b> <br>  Review the list of "friends." <br>  There is always a certain threshold of losses that you are ready to take in order to preserve ‚Äúfriendship.‚Äù  Such an assessment becomes the cornerstone around which further actions are built.
