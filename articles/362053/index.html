Portable audio system for lovers of multifunctional devices</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Hello!  As I promised, the continuation of the material in four parts on different mobile (and not so) columns.  With past issues can be found here: <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/229141/"><u>one</u></a> , <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/229391/"><u>two</u></a> .  Today, our guest is one of the smallest devices in the Creative product line: a portable desktop speaker SoundBlaster Axx200.  Despite its compact size, the device pleases with an abundance of features and capabilities, so do not judge a kid by size and look under the cat, we are interested. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/b52/34c/92d/b5234c92df1d799322254c141b68c1fe.png"><br><br>  About a year ago I was talking about the very first <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/163487/"><u>Axx'e</u></a> : the column, basically, could boast a spectacular appearance and interesting features.  The new version of Axx'a - deep processing of the inherent ideas in a compact form factor and with excellent new features. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h1>  Little Prince </h1><br>  In the latest products, Creative has moved from a wide variety of all sorts of colors, colors and variations to a simple product line.  Axx200 is one of such products: compact, multifunctional and having a very interesting result of the ratio of quality + features to price.

In addition to, in fact, the functions of a wireless speaker, it can act as a speakerphone, office communicator for audio and video conferencing, a loudspeaker, an audio recorder or a regular player.  Of course, some of this rich functionality is more likely to suit Korean children, and not adult guys like Habr and Giktaim visitors, but most of the possibilities fit perfectly into the most popular juz-cases for mobile acoustics. <br><br>  The most amazing thing Creative has accomplished when creating the Axx200 is the sound quality.  The progenitor of the Axx line, the Axx20 model was twice as large, and played about the same, if not worse.  In addition, it did not have a built-in battery, and it rather related to wireless desktop systems, like the Creative T30, which I <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/229141/">wrote</a> about not so long ago.  It cost, Axx20 is not the most decent 10 kilorubles: it is possible that the price was justified at the time of release, but today ... Today, for the hero of the review, Axx200 is asked for exactly six and a half <a href=""><u>thousand</u></a> , and the ratio of functionality to price has noticeably increased. <br><br><h1>  Appearance </h1><br>  Appearance is deceptive: in this little thing hidden a truly rich set of possibilities.  At the base of the device is still a regular hexagon, the top is still ‚Äúcut off‚Äù at an angle. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/c93/3e4/a7b/c933e4a7bc4b64cb51896a67c99b831a.jpg"></div><br><br>  Axx200 has so far come out only in one color - white (although I would not give up the black or red versions), but it also looks great.  I want to note that the development team took into account reviews of previous models and changed the materials of the case: the fabric protection was killed, instead of it the aluminum mesh was now changed, the design of the stand was changed: instead of the round cake, the Axx200 has a hexagonal charging docking station.  Actually, the whole ‚Äúdizign‚Äù is seen in the photo: nothing has changed, and at the same time everything has changed.  New materials, much more pleasant build quality, convenient control buttons on the rear panel. <br><br><h1>  Interior view </h1><br>  Inside, everything is also very nice and strictly functional.  I myself didn‚Äôt take Axx200 apart: I‚Äôve already done everything on iFixit, (and the reassembly requires special scotch) so I just comment on the photos. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/7e3/6df/bf5/7e36dfbf54158c74bcab06cbbdc26d9e.jpg"><br><br>  As you can see, there are not so many details.  Inside the column, in addition to the phase inverter, an impressive battery size of 5200 mAh, there are two more speakers with a diameter of 40 mm, a sly panel with a scattering of control elements, and also a very interesting four-level printed circuit board. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/224/2e3/daa/2242e3daa305d497728255da97598cbe.png"><br><br>  It is responsible for wireless functionality, all controls, inputs and outputs, and also contains a quad-core sound processor SB-Axx1.  Everything is collected very, very high quality, the manufacturer did not regret neither the time of the workers, nor the amount of adhesive tape: how many columns did not shake and did not squeeze - there were no sounds inside. <br><br><h1>  Opportunities </h1><br>  Actually, the most interesting - a set of features.  So, the speaker is able to play music through a 3.5mm input, via a stereo-bluetooth connection, well, through microiUSB: in the latter case, the host system provides the power of the audio chip and becomes an external audio card, which allows you to work not only with audio output, but also with input .  To do this, Axx'e installed four directional microphones at once (two in front, two, respectively, in the back).  They can work as an active noise cancellation system, in conference link mode, and also as a narrowly focused system: cut off unnecessary sounds and create a narrow corridor for working in noisy places. <br><br>  In addition to playing and recording sound with a smartphone / computer, the speaker is able to work fully autonomously.  On the back panel there is a slot for a MicroSD card, with which you can play music or to which you can write from microphones in voice recorder mode.  Opportunities strongly oppose those of ROAR, but if ROAR is more designed to be used as a music center, then Axx is a one-stop solution with an emphasis on rich telecommunications capabilities. <br><br><h1>  How it works? </h1><br>  The speaker passes all audio signals through the proprietary ‚Äúbrain‚Äù: the audio chip SB-Axx1.  In addition to the column, he also works in all headsets of the Evo Zx-series and in the top models Aurvana.  The characteristics of the chip are not disclosed: it is only known that it is multi-core and was developed, if not from scratch, then precisely under portable devices, it has reduced power consumption and a set of software and hardware features that are responsible for both the input and the output of the audio signal.  It is this ‚Äúlittle thing‚Äù that realizes to all the possibilities of noise reduction, voice change, calculation of virtual 3D sound (in headphones and headsets).  The column itself is managed through a mobile or desktop application. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/d00/0d3/0ef/d000d30efb4b587dea880e733793d8f3.png"><br><br>  <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/sg/app/sound-blaster-central/id532487984%3Fmt%3D8">IOS Version</a> |  <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details%3Fid%3Dcom.creative.central">Android Version</a> |  <a href="http://www.soundblaster.com/software/sound-blasteraxx-control-panel.aspx">PC / Mac version</a> <br><br>  The version for mobile systems is distinguished by a large number of functions (in fact, one of the main features is remote control by the speaker itself: absolutely all the ‚Äúbuttons‚Äù on the top and rear control panels are available). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/ef9/a91/1bb/ef9a911bb5675ef75e5fdf075a80eced.png"><br><br>  The desktop version got the functions that cannot be climbed using the hardware controls on the speaker itself, but can be customized due to the fact that the speaker on the PC is recognized as an external sound card with all the advantages of hardware decoding, an excellent microphone with a full set of noise settings and the ‚Äúdirections‚Äù of the beam, the system equalizer, and any improvements. <br><br><h1>  Competitors </h1><br>  Among the mobile speakers in this price range there are the following models: <br>
<h3>  Sony SRS-X5: 2x5BT + Subwoofer 10W, 1.2KG, from <a href="">6 to 8 thousand</a> rubles. </h3><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/a4e/f5a/a23/a4ef5aa235f48592f063fefcbc015b8d.png"><br><hr><br>  <b>Beats Pill 2.0: 12BT, 0.3KG, about <a href=""><u>9 thousand</u></a> rubles.</b> <b><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/f48/1c6/d0a/f481c6d0a65d6782f7a877499974969f.png"></b> <br><br><hr><br>  <b>Samsung DA-F60: 2x10BT, 1.1KG, about <a href=""><u>9 thousand</u></a> rubles.</b> <b><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/5c3/894/2b6/5c38942b6761f1d1fd527b3f944959dc.png"></b> <br><hr><br>  <b>Philips AD385: 2x4B, 1.45G, about <a href=""><u>4 thousand</u></a> rubles.</b> <b><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/79d/472/83f/79d47283ff33ccf9f031d283701ca560.png"></b> <br><hr><br>  <b>Jabra Solemate: 3x ???</b>  <b>BT, 0.61KG, about 6 <a href=""><u>thousand</u></a> rubles.</b> <b><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/e0b/1aa/7da/e0b1aa7daea966c418d124bde0dec6e1.png"></b> <br><br>  According to the Yandex Market, these are the most popular models of portable acoustics in the price segment from 5 to 10 thousand rubles.  Almost all of them are desktop or ‚Äúportable‚Äù, but certainly not portable: everyone, except for Beats Pill and the boot-like Jabra, weighs more than one kilogram, has a different version of brick design and a focus on ‚Äúpicnic‚Äù sound (that is, in fact, all these models are more competitors for <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/229391/">ROAR</a> , and not for the baby Axx'a).  In addition, none of these speakers does not have the ability to connect to a PC and work as a ‚Äúheadset‚Äù, the Jabra and Sony have a built-in microphone, but the ‚Äúgills‚Äù have no active noise cancellation system or software-hardware ‚Äúisolate‚Äù speech from the general background is not provided, and Sony is satisfied with only a simple noise and anti-echo system.  In general, I didn‚Äôt find anything with similar content in functions, work from several signal sources, quality and price: <i>if someone knows alternatives, throw a reference, add it to the text.</i> <br><br>  It so happened that this time on all fronts the competitors are either not competitors in terms of functionality or in form factor.  Do you like music?  Often you choose nature or just change the place of deployment?  Do you own a laptop and a smartphone?  It seems to me that SoundBlaster Axx will become a worthy companion: it will sound everything your heart desires and earn money with a microphone, and your smartphone will ‚Äúfeed up‚Äù with electricity in case of anything.  The widest functionality in terms of music, and in terms of a universal device for a computer and a smartphone for very reasonable money in a compact package.  We were looking for something similar, but ‚Äúeverything is not that‚Äù and ‚Äúeverything is not so‚Äù - take a look at Axx200.  Perhaps it's time to <a href="">end the</a> quest. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/362053/">https://habr.com/ru/post/362053/</a></p>
