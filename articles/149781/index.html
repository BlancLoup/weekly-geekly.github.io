  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Update Yandex.Money System Agreement</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  A little more than a year ago, the <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/121844/">bill on the national payment system</a> was adopted, and in the bill in part 1 of article 38 it was written: <br><blockquote>  1. Organizations that at the date of entry into force of this Federal Law were obliged persons for monetary obligations, provided for by Part 3 of Article 12 of this Federal Law (hereinafter referred to as organizations), may continue to assume such monetary obligations for 15 months from the date of official publication of this Federal Law. </blockquote><br>  In other words, another 15 months could work under the old conditions.  And continuing article 38, part 2: <br><br><blockquote>  2. During the period specified in paragraph 1 of this article, the obliged organization is also entitled to assign rights of claim and transfer the debt on the accepted monetary obligations, provided for by paragraph 3 of Article 12 of this Federal Law, to a credit institution that has the right to transfer funds without opening accounts, including electronic cash.  In this case, the obligated organization is obliged to notify individuals of the impending assignment of rights of claim and transfer the debt by placing the appropriate announcement in the media, on its Internet site, and also has the right to send the notice by other means. </blockquote><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/87d/18e/c58/87d18ec58dbcb1d78a617e727fed938a.png" align="right">  Yandex.Money started notifying users (I personally just a couple of hours ago received a notification on a tethered phone, no notification was received in the mail) about a renewal of the contract with Yandex.Money.  Also, a <a href="">notification</a> appeared on the Yandex.Money home page about accepting new Yandex.Money terms of use, I quote: <a name="habracut"></a><br><br><blockquote>  Limited Liability Company PS Yandex.Dengi notifies its customers that in accordance with the requirements of Part 2 of Art.  38 of the law "On the national payment system" assigns the right to claim and transfers the debt on the obligations to customers under the Agreement on the use of the System to a limited liability company by a non-bank credit organization Yandex.Money.

      <br>
      If you do not send your objections to the transfer of rights of claim and transfer of debt to OOO PS Yandex.Money within thirty days from the date of this notice, you will be deemed to have consented to the assignment of rights of demand and transfer of debt. <br><br>  The moment of the assignment of rights of demand and transfer of debt is the moment you accept the terms of the <a href="">Agreement on the transfer of funds without opening an account using the Yandex.Money service</a> .  If you accept the terms of this Agreement before September 27, 2012, the moment of the assignment of rights of claim and transfer of debt will be September 27, 2012. </blockquote><br>  <a href="">The agreement</a> will enter into force on September 27, 2012, the old agreement is available at <a href="">this</a> link.  The laws are not strong, and therefore the question arises - are we losing something from this? <br><br>  At the moment, it turns out that Yandex.Money has received a license, and now they are non-profit organizations (non-bank credit organizations) and therefore renew contracts. <br><br>  In addition, the limits on the operation remain the same, but are now prescribed in the law.  And <a href="">plus</a> : <blockquote>  13.2. The NCO is liable to the Client for the reimbursement of the latter for the amount of transactions performed without the consent of the Client, in accordance with the requirements of art.  9 of the law "On the national payment system." </blockquote>  That is, Yandex.Money will now compensate for the damage if operations were performed without the consent of the client (user), since Yandex.Money was not <a href="">previously</a> responsible for this: <blockquote>  8.6.  The System Operator shall not be liable for damages to the User resulting from illegal actions of third parties, including those related to illegal access to the Wallet. </blockquote></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/149781/">https://habr.com/ru/post/149781/</a></p>
