Of course, we could not get past such an event and released a third version of Evernote for the iPhone, in which we tried to maximize the latest features of the firmware. <br><br>  Download the new Evernote, as usual, is available for free in the <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewSoftware%3Fid%3D281796108%26mt%3D8">App Store</a> . <br><br>  <b>So, what's new in Evernote 3.0</b>

    <a name="habracut"></a>  If you know English, then you can simply watch the overview video, (however, the video, as it seems to us, is visual) well, and the details are in Russian below. <br><br><iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/1V44XB1gvFg%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700019,15700186,15700190,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhhJkw-vLtO-XTdCAbwYx1h27uLLKQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  <b>Inconspicuous synchronization</b> <br>  We completely rewrote the part of the application responsible for data synchronization in order to use the capabilities of iPhone 3.0, and now information about all notes (but not their contents) is locally available on the device.  This means that you can scroll through the list of thousands of notes, without interrupting the click on the "Load another 25 ..." button.  Filtering by tags, attributes, notebooks and geographical location is carried out without a request to the server, that is, almost instantly.  The contents of the notes are now quickly cached and you can view the note that you opened earlier very quickly. <br><br>  <b>No delays</b> <br>  A new approach to data processing also makes it possible to get rid of the need to observe notifications that a particular note is now synchronized.  It will be available in the list of notes, like any other, and it can be edited at any time. <br><br>  <b>Notes on the map</b> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b62/f73/2a8/b62f732a8756666096d6b2907bf76df3.gif" alt="image"><br>  We have always had a weakness for maps, but it has become noticeable only now.  By pressing one button, you can now see all your notes scattered around the map.  When the zoom is small, the numbers show how many notes you have taken in a particular region of the world.  You can zoom in until you see notes in the form of pins.  Now, if you need to quickly remember how the locals called that herring marinated with mustard, which you ate in Stockholm last summer, just stick a finger across Sweden and find what you were looking for. <br><br>  <b>Instant Grouping</b> <br>  View mode allows you to group notes by date, alphabet, notepads, cities and countries.  You can also quickly jump to different groups using the scroll bar to the right of the list of notes (or below, if you are viewing in landscape mode).  And you can also hold your finger on it for high-speed flipping.  Having mastered using groups, maps and scrolling, it will be easy to quickly get to the desired note and without using search. <br><br>  <b>Advanced Search</b> <br>  But, of course, you can still find notes using the old proven method, since we also worked on the search.  Advanced search options are now easier and clearer.  Many types of search can be used without connecting to the server, so that work with them has become faster.  You can also quickly return to viewing all notes at any time. <br><br>  <b>Superior Voice Recorder</b> <br>  Much attention is paid to the function of audio recording in Evernote.  The recording time was doubled, the number of necessary clicks was reduced by half, and the design was updated. <br><br>  <b>Landscape viewing in film style</b> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/33e/590/125/33e590125a399023cf03165525389518.gif" alt="image"><br>  If there are a couple of thousand notes available, try to look through them with your iPhone on your side.  It looks quite impressive, a sort of temporary life line in the notes. <br><br>  <b>Finger care</b> <br>  We got rid of extra steps and small buttons and in the mode of photography.  Now you can take a picture and send it to Evernote with just a couple of clicks.  If you need to add a heading, tags or accompanying text, it is enough just to get a picture from the list of notes.  Of course, it‚Äôs no longer necessary to wait until the end of synchronization. <br><br>  <b>Teamwork</b> <br>  Evernote 3.0 supports integration with applications from other developers for the iPhone.  We are waiting for some interesting programs in which Evernote is present in the near future, which we will definitely tell about separately. <br><br>  <b>Wide horizons</b> <br>  Of course, the new features already implemented in this version are very important for us, but it is also worth noting that Evernote 3.0 for iPhone is the most powerful mobile platform that we have ever done, and based on it you can create things , which previously could not even dream of.  Of course, I would not like to talk specifically about what we dream, since some ideas are still a long way from their implementation, but in general, the topics that we occupy can be voiced.  This is collaboration, geo-search, integration with the calendar, case management, audio search, compass use and memory training ... In general, it‚Äôs probably better to report as soon as they arrive.  :) <br><br>  We will be grateful for the feedback, suggestions and comments. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/62320/">https://habr.com/ru/post/62320/</a></p>
