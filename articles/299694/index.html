      Everything else would be irrelevant if I were better than other people.  If I could somehow stand out, if I were in some sense elected. <br><br>  Perhaps life would be much easier.  My intellect would help me <a href="http://blog.mbaconsult.ru/blog/personal/10-zabavnykh-uprazhneniy-kotorye-pomogut-vam-stat-bolee-uspeshnym-predprinimatelem/">to become an ideal entrepreneur</a> and start the most correct business project at the most appropriate time. <br><br>  I could become famous and get rich quick.  How great it is to be different. <br><br>  It was very difficult to come to terms with the fact that I was not at all special and I would never become like that, and that in all respects I was an absolutely normal and quite standard person. <br><br>  Almost all people can be divided into two groups.  Members of the first group consider themselves not to be like everyone else - because they are prettier, smarter, or, on the contrary, something worse than others.  In the second group there are people who do not consider themselves to be special, but would like to be. <br><br>  I met a lot of different people.  Among them were both rich and poor.  I am familiar with mathematical geniuses and with people who have not graduated even from high school, as well as with <a href="http://testutor.ru/blog/9-kommunikativnyx-navykov-kotorymi-dolzhen-obladat-lyuboj-uspeshnyj-lider/">successful businessmen, leaders</a> , and exhausted polishers from the factory. <br>  Do you know what they all look like? <br><br>  Each of them was born, lived for some time and will surely die in the future. <br><br>  But none of them can be called exceptional.  None of my acquaintances was more or, conversely, less special than I, or you, or any other person living on earth. <br><br>  Some people are satisfied with their lives, while others are not very, but this does not make them unusual. <br><br>  Some of them evoke inspiration, while others eke out a miserable existence, but this has nothing to do with their appearance or with the ability to make intelligent speeches. <br><br>  Because such a thing as exclusivity simply does not exist.  People are not born special.  No one is destined to become a millionaire or a brilliant inventor, no one is born to establish a successful company, such as Netscape and Microsoft, or create masterpieces of art, or save lives. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0071c5">People are not born special.</font>  <font color="#0071c5">They just do unusual things.</font> </h2><br>  People use randomly obtained opportunities to make something incredible.  They work hard, try their best and win from time to time. <br><br>  They do something special, for example, they write programs or help victims of violence.  Fly into space.  Feed the poor.  Create startups.  They question the customary order or challenge the authorities.  They create applications for the iPhone, write books, and raise children. <br><br>  They are able to do this, not because they were born special, but because they worked hard, tried hard and did not stop halfway through. <br><br>  What do I like about it?  Why am I happy about the fact that each of us is an ordinary middle man?  For good reason.  In fact, there are only three of them: <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0071c5">No one has a greater right to success than you!</font> </h2><br>  Some people lurk on this path many difficulties.  Poverty, mental ill health, race or gender - all of these incredibly gifted personalities can come across. <br><br>  However, the fact that you did not have these problems does not mean that you are something better. <br><br>  The fact that you were born as a fair-skinned boy in a wealthy family is not unusual.  If you think that it gives you some privileges, then all modern humanity will consider you an idiot. <br><br>  From birth, no one has the right to success, achievement and victory.  Some people will find it harder to achieve this.  For others, everything will go more smoothly.  Someone lucky.  But this is not a sign of exclusivity. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0071c5">Everyone can achieve something special!</font> </h2><br>  Since there are no special people from birth, it means that nothing is impossible for you.  If you really want to achieve something, there are no natural and predetermined reasons for failure. <br><br>  As mentioned above, this can be difficult.  Sometimes even almost impossible.  As if in front of you, a sheer cliff suddenly rises, on which it will be necessary to climb.  But <a href="http://testutor.ru/blog/kak-nauchitsya-sebya-kontrolirovat-i-nachat-zhit-toj-zhiznyu-o-kotoroj-vy-mechtaete/">you can try, even if the chance is absolutely tiny</a> . <br><br>  There is nothing in you that prevents you from taking a chance and does not allow you to succeed. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0071c5">In some things you may be completely incompetent!</font> </h2><br>  But if you do not try to show your exclusivity, the burden of responsibility is significantly reduced.  This means that you can afford to fail, stumble and ruin everything.  Even if you hardly understand anything, no big deal. <br><br>  It does not matter.  There is no table of estimates that you supposedly must meet because of some innate factor or a part of your personality that is out of your control.  That is, even if your project fails miserably, you just need to start over. <br><br>  You will disappoint those who see you as "special."  No one will condemn you for failure. <br><br>  Let's stop at this.  Parting words are often full of rubbish.  For example, stories about how graduates who came from some hole, could change the world for the better.  But one speech, it seems to me, stands out from the general range: <br><blockquote> Train your will and independent creative thinking not for your own satisfaction, but for the benefit that you can bring to other people, the entire population of the planet, as well as our descendants.  And then you will discover one great and very curious truth from the field of human experience.  It consists in the fact that dedication is the best quality, first of all for yourself.  The best joys of life become available only after realizing that you are not special. </blockquote><br>  David mccellow <br><br>  <b>P.S.</b>  I know that there is a difference between these two concepts: to be born special and to have opportunities.  I understand that for some people, due to the lack of possibilities, this article may seem to be almost meaningless. <br><br>  But I want you to think about this.  The word ‚Äúspecial‚Äù carries a certain meaning. <br><br>  In essence, it means "best."  But I do not think that you are becoming better than others because of the very fact that there are any opportunities. <br><br>  PS We recommend another useful article on the topic of work on yourself - <a href="http://testutor.ru/blog/pochemu-nekotorym-lyudyam-vezyot-namnogo-bolshe-chem-drugim/">WHY DO SOME PEOPLE CARRY THIS TO MUCH MORE THAN OTHER?</a>  . <br><br>  The author of the translation is Vyacheslav Davidenko, the founder of the <a href="http://testutor.ru/">TESTutor</a> company. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/299694/">https://habr.com/ru/post/299694/</a></p>
