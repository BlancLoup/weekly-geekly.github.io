  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The first ‚Äúnational‚Äù presentation of htc Desire HD and htc Desire Z in Russia - photo report</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  On Monday evening, in Moscow, in the store and customer support center - htc Care - the first in Russia presentation of two new android flagships of the company: htc Desire HD and htc Desire Z. This presentation was significant for two reasons.  Firstly, this is, as has already been said, the first in Russia presentation of new phones, and secondly, only bloggers, followers of twitter htc were invited to this presentation.  But, of course, not all, but only the first 25 people who won the contest, which was held on Twitter. <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/6c/66/6c665a02e3bd2af610431b1cf68dd4bb.jpg" alt="image"></a> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/9c/45/9c4537a679fb0e1653f2ec4edc98017d.jpg" alt="image"></a> <br><br>  The competition was simple: you had to answer one simple question regarding new products.  The one who closely monitors the company's products, will answer the question without hesitation.  And the one with whom newtwitter is connected can follow the answers (replicas) to the question and thus cheat.  ;) There is another good news, such presentations will be repeated.  And not sometime, but in the very near future - in the next two weeks several more similar presentations will take place, invitations will still be played out on Twitter.

      Under the cut - a photo report and a small exclusive video showing the principle of the new feature - htc Likes.  All photos are clickable. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  The presentation of the htc product trainers was Vyacheslav and Elena. <br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/5d/d0/5dd05f72f210786af9e0a30ba648a7d3.jpg" alt="image"></a> <br><br>  At the beginning, the presenters talked a lot about the updated htc Sense shell and new ‚Äúdesires‚Äù. <br>  I think that everyone is already aware of the main improvements of the shell and filling devices, so I will list only the "very-most": <br><ul><li>  Manage, search and lock your phone, save SMS backups and contacts through your personal account on HTCSense.com </li><li>  Sync with iTunes </li><li>  The htc likes service appeared - an analogue of AppBrain - Sense users can recommend applications to each other and write comments to them. </li><li>  Sense sdk.  Developers will be able to create new widgets and integrate their programs into the htc Sense shell.  Those who wish to engage in cooperation "at the program level", you must send a request to anna_grygorieva [dog] rayacontactcenter.com </li><li>  Now you can edit Word / Excel / Powerpoint documents </li><li>  Fast boot phone (Fastboot) </li><li>  There was a quick transfer of contacts from another phone (Apple, Blackberry, HTC, LG, Motorola, Nokia, Samsung, SonyEricsson, and others) </li><li>  During an incoming call, a summary of the caller is displayed (date of birth and status on facebook) </li><li>  Dolby mobile sound coprocessor, SRS sound and equalizer (I hope that there will be no problems with sound - like in htc desire - in new devices.) </li><li>  Pre- and post-photo editor </li><li>  Flash 10.1 support </li><li>  Built-in WiFi - 3G router </li><li>  Internet connection via PC </li><li>  Download skins and music themes from HTC Hub </li><li>  And much more. </li></ul><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/27/eb/27eb2319e1425818f97562308b0f481a.jpg" alt="image"></a> <br><br>  Small video demonstration of htc likes.  Exclusive short video. <br><iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/e8sMaWSoKIE%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700021,15700186,15700190,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhj7C7HY0oPJaRX3o3KRUXVXHXIjOg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  Elena and Vyacheslav not only talked about the new Sense chips, but also showed the functions of the updated shell.  On the laptop was installed some kind of proprietary software htc, which in real time shows everything that happens on the display of the smartphone.  In theory, this program can greatly help developers to make a video, but whether it will be bundled with Sense sdk or not is unknown. <br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/bc/dc/bcdc2ca0c3e0738832fc3d0ff98afb5d.jpg" alt="image"></a> <br><br>  Someone is watching a presentation, and someone is choosing a new smartphone. <br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/1f/c8/1fc809c62b1e248cbd1ee05a90919382.jpg" alt="image"></a> <br><br>  During the presentation, htc care continued to work as usual.  Anyone could login. <br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/d7/80/d7807ed1b72fc7183d606689f02467a3.jpg" alt="image"></a> <br><br>  Checking the face recognition function of a smartphone camera. <br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/25/e2/25e27c744dfa804a00f79209f309709c.jpg" alt="image"></a> <br><br>  After the introductory part was completed, it was possible to get acquainted with the novelties on the spot, turn them in their hands and check everything that the presenters were talking about. <br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/82/be/82bebfdf2a4a914945a8cfc977607af2.jpg" alt="image"></a> <br><br>  That same laptop with the same software.  It was not possible to identify the software, and the htc employees did not disclose its names. <br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/31/5e/315eba418d078470778fabed48725e0c.jpg" alt="image"></a> <br><br><h5>  Htc desire hd </h5><br><br>  You could touch htc desire HD and htc Desire Z. Only two phones were available for the ‚Äútests‚Äù - one HD and one Z. More attention was attracted, of course, by Desire HD. <br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/ac/fa/acfa247c043497da87369330ef5b6474.jpg" alt="image"></a> <br><br>  He attracted a lot of attention. <br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/50/88/5088465f0921f785b5491d6edf05f71b.jpg" alt="image"></a> <br><br>  A lot of attention.  This phone squeezed to the last. <br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/85/f7/85f78310f9ce6df8bd708ac9055833e4.jpg" alt="image"></a> <br><br>  The screen is large, 4.3 (480x800), superLCD.  But how he will behave in the sun and how long the battery lasts is the question. <br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/cc/56/cc56e3d87ca9ad14059c6bb6356bde11.jpg" alt="image"></a> <br><br>  When the screen is turned off at the Desire HD, you can see the navigation grid.  When the backlight is on, the grid is invisible.  Unpleasant <br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/c3/6f/c36f01d58371e14315be4f18f5c5cd65.jpg" alt="image"></a> <br><br>  At the bottom of the device is 3.5 mm audio jack, microUSB and microphone hole. <br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/a4/dd/a4dd55e3ed7ca41b654e698fc04310ad.jpg" alt="image"></a> <br><br>  On the left you can see the volume rocker and the battery cover. <br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/2a/81/2a81579bc4b4c1cf71b3b2071ffcb1b8.jpg" alt="image"></a> <br><br>  The right edge of the phone is smooth, like a <s>baby's</s> bald head. <br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/78/3b/783bbcc731738163350c9d36d8adf342.jpg" alt="image"></a> <br><br>  Behind - a dual LED flash, a big eye 8-megapixel camera with autofocus and a microphone for recording sound.  It is known that the camera was not of the best quality on htc Desire, I would like to hope that HD has a better situation with the camera. <br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/08/fa/08fa07f04b50561ac0b722d69cc051a2.jpg" alt="image"></a> <br><br>  Under the bottom cover are slots for a SIM card and a memory card. <br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/3e/2c/3e2cdf5bfa444d90c7de601746bb7ad8.jpg" alt="image"></a> <br><br>  The battery in Desire HD is hidden in the same place as in the HTC Legend - under the case.  Therefore, you can forget about the extended-capacity battery.  It is sad.  If autonomy is important, then you can buy an external USB battery.  But, as a rule, finding an external battery with the required output power is not always easy. <br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/ad/71/ad7138eb058c23b17dd210e8a3b080af.jpg" alt="image"></a> <br><br>  htc Desire HD at the moment - the most sophisticated smartphone companies. <br>  Competitors - Samsung Galaxy S, which, I hope, will fall in price after the release of Desire HD.  In addition to galaxy there is Acer stream or Google Nexus One.  And the usual htc desire should not be forgotten. <br><br><h5>  htc desire z </h5><br><br>  The second novelty is the ‚ÄúZ-slider‚Äù htc Desire Z. When the device unfolds, it somewhat resembles the letter Z. <br><br>  I think Desire Z is much more interesting than Desire HD.  Now you can‚Äôt surprise anyone with a tricky phone, but there are very few good qwerty sliders on android now on the market. <br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/33/ad/33ad38261711707e2bdaec11bc50aeef.jpg" alt="image"></a> <br><br>  At first glance, Desier Z is quite nothing. <br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/0e/81/0e81c2f90f43893af4bd6769a0af0fb8.jpg" alt="image"></a> <br><br>  But what will happen in reality - only experience of use will show.  For a couple of minutes of dating to understand something completely is very difficult.  In the photo - the final version of the Russian keyboard localization smartphone.  Screen - 3.7 ", superLCD. <br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/35/66/356607ff61a6a4783476e88bf990878b.jpg" alt="image"></a> <br><br>  <s>The letter sic!</s>  That same letter Z, even with something similar.  At the top there is a power key and a 3.5 mm audio jack. <br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/8e/cb/8ecb7a9ebe31a145a11a3a05d9a787ca.jpg" alt="image"></a> <br><br>  On the right is a camera button and a lever that is used to remove the back cover. <br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/06/01/0601a668975b85fa660888eaa89e335b.jpg" alt="image"></a> <br><br>  On the left is the volume rocker and micro-usb connector. <br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/a7/e4/a7e44f8cdd7107bc923756524a9830e5.jpg" alt="image"></a> <br><br>  Below is a microphone hole. <br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/ea/ec/eaec03060979c8e1bf728daf2e7b6f07.jpg" alt="image"></a> <br><br>  Behind - a five-megapixel camera with autofocus and flash. <br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/06/4b/064bba3daaa3da3a3deef0080d1c9e27.jpg" alt="image"></a> <br><br>  With competitors not a lot.  I remember only motorola Milestone, Highscreen Zeus from Vobis and XPERIA X10 mini pro. <br><br>  Here is a brief and everything that was on the event.  At the end, all the guests were given a package with gifts: a mouse pad, a notebook, a htc branded key ring, a branded pen, an advertising booklet in the style ‚ÄúOur phones are the best, buy only them‚Äù and for ‚Äúsweet‚Äù rubber htc Desire. <br>  Package, with gifts, unfortunately, I lost somewhere at home.  Therefore, the photo, alas, no. <br><br>  Unfortunately, during the presentation it was impossible to communicate with the devices more closely, so the report indicated mainly what the presenters were talking about.  That is - some advantages.  I really hope that the samples of htc Desire HD and htc Desire Z will fall into my hands to write about them for Habr in more detail, to indicate all the pros and cons. <br><br><h5>  Specifications </h5><br><br><table border="1"><tbody><tr><td></td><td>  Desire HD (27990) </td><td>  Desire Z (25990) <br>  (Z-Slider, QWERTY keyboard) </td></tr><tr><td>  CPU </td><td>  1 HZ </td><td>  800 MHz </td></tr><tr><td>  OS </td><td colspan="2">  Android 2.2 with HTC Sense </td></tr><tr><td>  Memory </td><td>  1.55 GB, 768 MB + SD 32 </td><td>  1.5 GB, 512 MB, + SD32 </td></tr><tr><td>  Weight </td><td>  164 gr </td><td>  180 gr </td></tr><tr><td>  GPS </td><td colspan="2">  Built-in GPS antenna </td></tr><tr><td>  Sensors </td><td colspan="2">  G-Sensor, Digital Compass, Light Sensor, Proximity Sensor </td></tr><tr><td>  Connections </td><td colspan="2">  Bluetooth 2.1 with FTP / OPP for file transfer, A2DP for wireless stereo headset.
