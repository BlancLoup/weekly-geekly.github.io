Companies that deliberately fight for talent, in which almost all means are good.  And we have already discussed how technology affects the work of recruiters, HRs, but have you ever tried to look at it differently?  What changes HR-tech for candidates, their perception of the process of finding a job, hiring and communicating with a potential employer. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/524/502/ce0/524502ce07944cd38c0b368cca5577ba.png"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  Workability - a litmus test for candidates </h4><br>  Information is the only truly comprehensive answer to the question of how the process of job search for candidates has changed.  And just an understanding of the labor market. <br><br>  Modern candidates have their own relationship with technology - if they see something from the 90s, they don‚Äôt take it seriously.  Ugly, unstable, inconvenient - this is enough to close the page and never return to it.  They broadcast live on Instagram, chat on Snapchat, and from school years listen to music on the iPod.  And they understand perfectly well how can work in the company be - for this there are fashion blogs describing incredible buns.  And at the same time, we have such sad statistics about HR's specialists:

The opportunity to get information about your company gave candidates a huge advantage - now they can compare.  We also know that candidates look at about 6 pages with references to your company before responding to a job.  And all these 6 pages you can easily create and manage yourself: your common site, career page, then your profiles in social networks and, at worst, on a working site. <br><br><h4>  Passive candidates are almost non-existent. </h4><br>  There are several categories of candidates: passive, passively active, active, hyperactive. <br><br>  // Hyperactive publish posts in the FB with a list of skills, experience, education, accompanying all this with sometimes funny jokes and your own photo. <br>  // Active people simply place resumes on work sites and try to look for vacancies themselves in the vast social networks. <br>  // Passively active seems to be subscribed to all sorts of groups with vacancies, but do not advertise their desire to change jobs. <br>  // Passives remain passive and continue to work. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/435/ade/72b/435ade72b9be483b9ef9c36a088c0a85.png"><br>  According to Linkedin Hiring Statistics 2017 <br><br>  <b>This means that the market is very, very active.</b> <br><br>  Social networks have allowed us to always be in touch and in the know about events, events, news of familiar and not very familiar people, and, of course, open vacancies.  They also added instant messengers in which you can subscribe to the channel with vacancies and quietly and peacefully view new offers. <br><br>  But a gloomy predictive analytics appeared on the guard of order in companies (even large working sites announced a launch): employers may know which employees are going to change jobs and who are dissatisfied with their position in a competitor company.  Transparency is bearing fruit - it is difficult (almost unreal) to be a completely passive candidate. <br><br><h4>  Looking for a job in social media </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/e57/8e8/1ae/e578e81aecdf4ae5ad3dd32c6144617f.png"><br><br>  And at the beginning of that year, this figure was significantly lower - about 60%. <br><br>  Of course, working sites remain relevant, but rather at the level of ‚Äúpost, and suddenly‚Äù.  The irrelevance of proposals from such sources often surprises and disappoints candidates.  We have already <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/potok/blog/325112/">written about why working sites will have a transformation period</a> - social media will assume the role of job boards, and companies will learn to broadcast the brand through their pages. <br><br>  <i>* lyrical digression about <a href="https://potok.io/">potok</a> : here you can make your own career site, make response forms branded and adapted for mobile devices, post vacancies in social networks, and quickly respond to candidates directly from the system - we know how to make candidates You did not doubt your manufacturability and that your working tools should be convenient for you *</i> <br><br><h4>  Candidates count on friends </h4><br>  According to a <a href="http://incrussia.ru/news/issledovanie-bolshe-poloviny-rossiyan-ishchut-rabotu-po-znakomstvu/">study by the</a> RANEPA, since 2013 there are 20% more candidates looking for work through friends. <br><br>  Companies are increasingly beginning to introduce recommender recruitment - and this is reasonable, because they spend on searching for one candidate two times less time and two times less money.  Social media also helps to connect friends to job search - people actively help their friends.  Now, when each dating circle, accessible with just a couple of clicks, is 250 friends, of course, we ask them for advice and sometimes even help.  And throwing a resume or just sharing a link to a job is a matter of a few seconds.  The network of candidates affects their success in finding a job, but also the network of your employees affects the speed and cost of closing vacancies.  Here is the <a href="http://blog.potok.io/secret-test/">secret link</a> where the recommendation recruitment system is hidden. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/20d/3e9/216/20d3e9216db14a4c876a05ab8e9cfe0c.png"><br><br><h4>  Love brands and look for them. </h4><br>  We constantly communicate with a huge number of candidates and we know that many of them want to work in specific companies.  This means that candidates have a fairly clear idea of ‚Äã‚Äãa potential employer and understand which company they would like to work with. <br><br>  The most important advantage for job seekers is their career opportunities.  And the main channel for obtaining information in this case is the company's career site.  (Linkedin Hiring Statistics 2017) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/c26/90d/932/c2690d9326e04ea79629716cea3ee17b.png"><br>  LinkedIn Global Talent Trends <br><br><h4>  Response as a game and chat with a bot </h4><br>  Literally over the last 5-8 years, the approach to the response has seriously changed - employers have often come up with interesting test items, share business cases with candidates that they can decide, arrange open days at offices and meetings.  The alignment of forces has changed - candidates are waiting for involvement.  They need a challenge, some kind of task, something catching attention.  The same type of job descriptions with stupid rubrication becomes less.  What are only startups like <a href="https://www.pymetrics.com/">Pymetrics</a> and <a href="https://www.pomello.com/">Pomello</a> , where you are offered to play games and then find a job according to your skills, qualities and ability to be a leader.  You yourself see it, because you are constantly creating forms in Google Forms (be careful with this, 152 FZ!), Where you additionally ask to answer all sorts of interesting questions. <br><br>  HR-technologies just allow candidates to engage as much as possible.  Whether it is a convenient form where they can leave the data from a smartphone, an application with gamification elements or a bot that will answer questions and call for an interview. <br><br>  There is no doubt that the candidates have become much more interesting (and, as it seems to us, more difficult) to play this job search game. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/be1/d69/007/be1d690079594b5a81b7de6431587a52.png"><br><br><h4>  Communicate with gifs and stickers in instant messengers and social networks </h4><br>  Communication, no matter how strange it may sound, has become more personalized - usually the recruiters approach the valuable candidate with a specific proposal.  This simplifies the process. <br><br>  Well, in general, the format of communication is changing. <br>  With the email correspondence with generation Z, things are not too smooth.  Many people can not stand to write letters, put in the end ‚ÄúRegards‚Äù.  It takes time.  Young candidates who are accustomed to communicate with memes, emoji and ‚Äúlol‚Äù, ‚Äúcakes‚Äù also often neglect punctuation.  It is difficult to blame them strongly, because the communication now really happens very often at the level of gifs.  So now the channels of communication with the audience are social networks, instant messengers. <br><br>  This is good for you, because the letter can be simply ignored, but not answering a personal message, where the activity of a person in the last hours seems to be already uncomfortable.  And the speed of answers is also growing - you have the opportunity to solve very many questions much faster.  But the candidates did not hide ‚Äî so connected now is their professional and personal life, that any resume is equal to a page on a social network. <br><br><h4>  Need to get feedback </h4><br>  Technologies allow recruiters and HRs to give feedback.  No pigeons, just one sent message: ‚ÄúYour resume has been received, reviewed and responded within a week.‚Äù <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/833/cb1/45f/833cb145fc2548038123fcceec55ec12.png"><br><br>  And only 41% do remain with some feedback, while others simply struggle with silence about what saddened us with a report of LinkedIn Hiring Statistics 2017. <br><br><h4>  Quick and painless interview </h4><br>  Video interviews are used by many companies.  Candidates are ready for this turn of events - this allows them to save the time they spend on the way to the office, waiting.  At any really convenient time for them, they can take and have an interview.  Although, of course, it is not easy to give it - it will not work here to get an instant feedback. <br><br>  Some recruiters and HRs conduct interviews on Skype, which also allows both parties not to spend a lot of time on each interview. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/329216/">https://habr.com/ru/post/329216/</a></p>
