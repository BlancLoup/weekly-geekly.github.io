  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Blackberry on Mobilefest: first public speaking in Russia. What to expect?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  I have to say: I am not for RIM or against Android, I am for a variety of types and forms, I want users to have the opportunity to choose and not be clamped in one coordinate system.  Therefore, I am by default for any alternative mobile OS, alternative from Android and iOS, which, well, the truth is already podzadolbali.  It is clear that the future of each brand is in a hardware-platform bundle, systems like iPod + iTunes rule the world, and this trend will increase even more with the purchase of Google by Motorola‚Äôs mobile unit, everyone will rush to develop their own OSs and markets.  Maybe it delivers more crap to developers, but, on the other hand, there are more opportunities to make money. <br><br>  In this post - a few thoughts about the Russian way of the company RIM, which <a href="http://www.nomobile.ru/news/126869.html">recently released the same SDK (albeit a demo)</a> , and next week the company representatives will speak for the first time at an event for <a href="http://spb2011.mobilefest.ru/%3Futm_source%3Dnomobile%26utm_medium%3Dbanner%26utm_campaign%3Dconference">MobileFest</a> developers in St. Petersburg. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  <a href="http://spb2011.mobilefest.ru/spikeryi/">There will be two speakers from RIM at the event</a> , obviously, they will be the headliners of the conference, as they are performing for the first time in public.  This is Andrei Kiselev, whose position formally sounds like ‚Äúthe operator relations manager,‚Äù although in essence he represents the entire Russian office of RIM, as well as Ola Lars√©n, whose business card reads ‚ÄúRIM / BlackBerry Head‚Äù.  Andrei has been working for the last 20 years in the field of Information Technologies and Telecommunications in leading companies in North America and Europe, he returned to Russia from Italy.  Ola Larsen has been working in the IT / Telecom market for more than 16 years; among his track record are such companies as Telia Sonera and Sony Ericsson.

      Now, about the Playbook and the difficult fate of RIM in Russia.  I have been going with the Playbook for over a month now as with the main tablet and, of course, the main problem is the lack of applications.  I still can not dial the basic software package to use, although, however, I have great inquiries in this regard.  But let's say, there is still no tweeter client, no Evernote, and a lot more, which is critical for me.  By the way, I wrote a <a href="http://www.itogi.ru/hitech-gadget/2011/33/168571.html">small review of the tablet for the magazine ‚ÄúItogi‚Äù</a> , but my hands will not reach the extended review, I‚Äôm still on vacation and writing this post, too, while in it :) <br><br>  The second problem of this particular tablet is the absence of a 3G module, but it is this ‚Äúcant‚Äù that theoretically could give a Playbook a chance on the Russian market.  After all, why is Andrei Kiselev called a manager of working with operators?  Because all RIM products can be sold exclusively through operators, the company is not allowed into the Russian market by our special services.  In all its products, RIM uses secure data transmission protocols over cellular networks, and the Blackberry products are used by the US and Canadian security services, of course, our FSB must know exactly what data passes through the devices and localize their sales.  That is why so far Blackberry smartphones can be bought only from operators, where there are servers of our special services, through which all traffic passes.  That is why WiFi is blocked on Blackberry smartphones, although it is pretty easy to get around.  And thus, one of the main advantages of RIM products is information security, in Russia it is not an advantage.  I know a person who uses a Blackberry smartphone purchased in the USA and does not connect it in Russia, but gets roaming, considering himself protected (although he does not use voice calls and SMS, uses only 3G and checks mail, with the international package connected T-Mobile is not so expensive).  While Blackberry smartphones at an insane price can be bought from MTS and Beeline, in the near future they will also appear from Megaphone. <br><br>  This greatly limits the ability of RIM in the Russian market, they have to rely solely on the activity of operators, hoping that they will put enough effort to sell their products.  The brand has its hands tied, they cannot reach the mass market, cannot flexibly regulate prices and react quickly in communication with customers.  And in this context, the first and so far the only product of the company without 3G is the Blackberry Playbook, and if the FSB allows RIM to sell it bypassing the operators, this could be a chance for RIM.  Then the tablet will be able to be in Euroset, Svyaznoy, Eldorado, M-Video and other grids, and although it will seem uncompetitive against the background of 3G tablets standing in the same place, many of which will also be cheaper, it‚Äôs better anyway. than rely on operators. <br><br>  However, the FSB may well not give the Playbook a green corridor, this is the first and so far the only tablet certified for US special services, so this loophole may well be closed. <br><br>  Despite the fact that at the same time, almost the entire Nomobile.ru team will work in Berlin at the largest international technical exhibition IFA 2011, we are informational sponsors of the event, and we will cover it on our website.  <a href="http://spb2011.mobilefest.ru/temyi/rim-istoriya-uspeha-novyie-produktyi-rabota-s-prilozheniyami-blackberry/">This is what is written on the site</a> about the RIM speech program, we can ask questions to RIM representatives from habra people, so you can ask here in the comments or in all my social networks. <br><br>  My <a href="http://twitter.com/turubar">Twitter</a> - <a href="http://twitter.com/turubar">@turubar</a> , <a href="http://www.facebook.com/turubar">Facebook</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/127246/">https://habr.com/ru/post/127246/</a></p>
