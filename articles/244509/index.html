Selection to the program is carried out within the framework of <a href="http://www.fasie.ru/akkreditovannye-meropriyatiya/2014">accredited events</a> in many cities of Russia.  The maximum amount of funding <b>400t.r</b> for two years, in four tranches of 100t.r every six months.

    <h3>  Event </h3><br>  I learned about the selection due to favorable circumstances.  More than a year ago, I tried to knock on the yellow doors of 1C with the words "guys, see what I do, suddenly you will be interested," at that moment the doors were closed, but my Email somehow got on the mailing list for "selection participants theses "which are annually spent by firm" 1 ".  It is thanks to this newsletter, I learned that <b>on November 15, in the framework of the "Day 1C: Career" in Moscow</b> will be selected in the program UMNIK. <br><br>  The selection consisted of two stages, correspondence and full-time.  For the correspondence stage, it was necessary to fill in a rather large-sized mold and attach a preliminary presentation.  In total there were just over 50 participants in the absentee selection, 11 of them were invited to attend full-time participation in Moscow. <br><br>  The first pleasant surprise for me was that <b>1C</b> offered to settle the participants for free in their hotel. <br>  The hotel was on the territory of their training center, everything was clean and tidy, the first day I lived alone in a double room, on the second I was hooked up by a guy from St. Petersburg. <br><br>  The selection took place in the morning, before the main event dedicated to the career day, and the selection results were announced a couple of hours after the performances ended.  I spoke sixth, the excitement was exactly before it was my turn to speak, because human nature is most tormented by the expectation of an event than the event itself =) <br><br>  I asked a friend to record the speech, then to analyze.  I will attach it at the end of the article, for those who are interested. <br><br><h3>  What will the money go </h3><br>  In addition to the cash bonus from the event, I received an emotional bonus, for me it was more important. <br>  I think everyone understands that 100t.r times every 6 months is not enough for any significant steps for the project from the ‚Äúbusiness‚Äù point of view, however this is not a bad pillow to try to implement some ideas without serious consequences. <br><br>  On the first tranche in the amount of 100t.r.  I plan to find a freelance developer for Android that implements the functionality I need in a mobile application, to finally provide my users with a long-developed and expected functionality.  If suddenly someone from the reader feels the strength to help me in this, but for one and earn, I will wait in a personal. <br><br>  I plan to spend the second part of financing for the first year on the development of the portal of my project <a href="http://www.1c-tools.ru/">www.1C-Tools.ru</a> <br><br><h3>  PS </h3><br>  Friends, if you do something interesting, try, knock on the yellow, black, red doors, and remember that even if you do not achieve it, in your opinion, this does not mean anything that it will not back up a little later, just as in a story with a random hit on the mailing list, which ultimately helped win. <br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/qAxwkuoZk94%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700023,15700186,15700191,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhgq390AmavAoWnwE3Enj8-P7B15PQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/244509/">https://habr.com/ru/post/244509/</a></p>
