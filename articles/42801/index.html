    <a name="habracut"></a>  I gave an example - carts.  Trolleys are different, but we all at least once encountered both construction trolleys and hypermarket trolleys, hand trolleys for carrying bags and of course the constant use of trolleys in supermarkets (any small self-service stores) and all of them come with wheels. <br><br><img src="http://s2.ipicture.ru/uploads/081020/fR2sAZ1g2P.jpg"><br><br>  <b>1 GB</b> <br>  Let's start with a regular construction truck with one wheel and compare it with 1GB of memory. <br><br>  <b>512 MB + 512 MB</b> <br>  What can be done in order to make life easier for the worker who is carrying this cart, for example, you can remove this single wheel and install two smaller wheels instead of it parallel to each other.  (Under the parallel arrangement means the installation of strips in dual channel mode). <br><br>  <b>1 GB + 1 GB</b> <br>  Or you can add another wheel, setting it parallel to the first one, BUT, this wheel must be exactly the same size as the first one. <br><br>  <b>1 GB + 2 GB</b> <br>  And what if the new wheel will be a little more than the second?  The cart will simply tip over to the left or right side, and even despite the fact that the workload the worker faces will slightly decrease, along with this, this scheme will give him some discomfort, and perhaps even the loss of some part of the raw material that he will transport . <br><br>  <b>1 GB + 1 GB + 1 GB (or 2 GB)</b> <br>  ABOUT!  Yes, this is the same cart, which I literally yesterday rolled through the supermarket!  Behind the two wheels and ahead of one always spinning in different directions. <br>  I think our worker will approve such a scheme. <br><br>  <b>1 GB + 1 GB + 512 MB + 512 MB</b> <br>  We continue to experiment and to the third modification with two large identical wheels we add those two wheels, which were used in the second version.  The worker will immediately relieve the load on the spine, and he will simply calmly push the cart forward or even pull back. <br><br>  <b>1 GB + 1 GB + 1 GB + 1 GB</b> <br>  Wow, it's just the same "all-wheel drive car"! <br><br>  <b>2 GB + 2 GB</b> <br>  And what will happen if in the ‚Äúthird version‚Äù to increase the size of the wheels - with them the trolley will become easier and in the future, we can always add two more wheels of the same size. <br><br>  <i>By the way, what about the appearance of the wheels and what kind of nonsense about 4 GB?</i> <br>  Is it worth talking about the advantages of installing wheels from the same manufacturer from the same batch?  I think everything is clear here.  And absolutely identical wheels will bring a certain share of esthetic pleasure to the owner of the cart! <br><br>  Many "ordinary users" have long known that the maximum of RAM that supports 32-bit systems rests on 4 GB (2 ^ 32 = 4294967296 - this is the limit of the address space for such an environment).  But, unfortunately, not everyone knows that even these 4 GB we can not fully use, because  some part, namely, about 0.5 will go to hardware support. <br><br>  All others who are still confident and love to argue on the topics that in Windows XP SP1 (2) and in Windows Vista there is full support for 4 GB, PAE (Physical Address Extension) will help you, I am not going to argue with you. <br><br>  <b>Conclusion:</b> <br>  2 GB is the best option for 32-bit systems <br>  and 3 GB is not always better than 2 GB, and if you still want the coveted 3rd gig, then think in advance about the installation scheme of the DDR slats. <br><br>  <b>P.S.</b> <b><br></b>  <b>‚ÄúBut what about the armada of laptops with 3 GB on board that is present in the market?‚Äù</b> <br><br>  <i>"Manufacturers of carts" do not stand still:</i> <br>  Synchronous and asynchronous dual-channel memory mode <br>  Many modern laptop chipsets, including all current Intel models, support synchronous dual-channel operation, i.e.  Both or all four memory modules must be equal.  Most chipsets also support asynchronous mode, which allows you to use both 1 GB and 2 GB modules at the same time so that the total memory reaches 3 GB while still using the two-channel mode.  Although this does not achieve full performance, which can be obtained in dual-channel mode, this method still provides faster operation than one channel, and there are no problems.  Nothing prevents you from replacing 1 GB of memory with a 2 GB module.  In the worst case, your system will work in single-channel mode, which will result in a very small loss of performance. <br><br><img src="http://s2.ipicture.ru/uploads/081020/WVw5OMS64n.jpg"></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/42801/">https://habr.com/ru/post/42801/</a></p>
