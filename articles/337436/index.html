  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Bitcoin farm and android miner app</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  This echo is nothing but ridiculous guesswork around Bitcoin.  Immediately I will say a distant amateur and try to argue in the abstract, as I see it. <br><br>  Let's imagine that a computer comp is a computer that creates a cycle to decrypt logic processes that require graphics memory and thereby generate valuable bitcoins.  And as a rule, the task is very complicated and requires significant resources and the main criterion of the same farm is to create an optimal network that has the best graphics processor for the best money today, not the best graphics card but good but not in trend and now you have a powerful PC, if there are several then the farm mutually reinforcing itself, or maybe not, but it doesn‚Äôt matter, let's analyze one pc and 1 resource per mining. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  According to my calculations, the average PC of the miner has a video card that has the price ratio of the most optimal power, it makes no sense to chase and take trivial prices for new products, but 1-2 models are worth it, 1 top card costs 50k, its resource is 30% better than its predecessor , and the predecessor is three times cheaper.  Well, such farms are combined optimally. <br><br>  I compared such video cards for today and noticed that they all almost do not exceed the playstation 3 graphics processor. But the GeForce GTX 1060 graphics card with a maximum bandwidth, for example, 192 Gb / s is even slightly lower than the Playstation 3, it has this capacity equal to 204.8 Gb / s with the GTX 1060 video card costs 22,000 on average, and the playstation is already assembled as a single graphical computer costs Avito 3000 rubles, the new $ 90 super slim 32, that is, 6000 rubles.  It turns out the farm from playstation 3 already looks very relevant if it is 5 times cheaper than the device with the same graphic power.  Moreover, it is easy to put a linkus on it and make mining of it a getter.

      This is the first time as a deficit of alleged capacity immediately drops to the starting point of the price in Avito at 3000 for one prefix.  Even if you buy all the consoles in the same way, I am sure that the nitdendo and any similar super devices of previous versions that can be linuxed are also suitable. <br><br>  I suppose the Bitcoin course can collapse sharply, realizing that now the race around mid-sized computers will have to be lowered to the Plekhs, they are the most optimal in price / graphical calculations for this confirmation by the Pentagon, who just created its data center using pure PlayStation 3 units, and saved on resources billions of bucks. <br><br>  But this is only the first optimal bitcoin stupidity to stick to the iron trend and creating the largest supercomputer, whose value is the number of participants in the network, the pentagon never dreamed of, although the pentagon can even have a data center more than the sum of all bitcoin participants, I am a dilettante, I can‚Äôt know how many operations per second all the world‚Äôs mainers are capable of solving and whether they are superior to the Pentagon, but apparently the plechs are the optimal gain. <br><br>  Bitcoin‚Äôs second stupidity as it seemed to me is money out of thin air, it‚Äôs impossible to drive 5 cars into the garage and see that 10 years later, well, except that the single network became stronger and every member of the supercomputer can solve any global computing task as soon as possible and any customer, who, for example, wants to open the notes of snowden not for 7 years but for example for a year, can do it through Bitcoin, buying a resource for his task at a giant world farm.  For example the state. <br><br>  But that is not the point.  The bottom line is that you can simply create an application for androids, by setting that you open the entire free resource of the phone to it, if you start the game, and the application forges the entire bitcoin for you, if you launch something important in the phone, the application will slow down and adjust to the balance, that is, in fact, you will know that the application does not interfere with you, but in turn it does something out of thin air, and you immediately receive regular real money for your balance on your phone every hour.  To do this, it is enough to catch the Internet once per hour, which is so everything and synchronize with the server, the server will automatically exchange bitcoins and replenish your balance, well, in the application you just need to enter your phone number.  You won‚Äôt even notice how miraculously the balance of the phone is replenished with you every hour.  This is called the button loot!  Obviously this bun will appeal to everyone, even the curious Chinese.  Even the mention of Bitcoin is not needed, the application will be called the Gold Digger, you enter the phone, you press it to start and your phone in the background is not noticeable for you to make you money.  Confirmation of SMS from the operator that the balance is nowhere in the balance.  No need to talk about Bitcoin which is not clear to anyone, everything is simple, you put the app and enter the phone, and the money in rubles go to the phone at the rate.  Well, the Chinese are in their yuan, and there are not any frightening words like Bitcoin.  There is just a balance and nat currency.  Fun stuff. <br><br>  And here, too, all the mainers understand how much a free resource has appeared that was so valuable during the maining, and the essence of the farm is no longer so beautiful. <br><br>  And judging by the <a href="http://www.liveinternet.ru/stat/ru/oses.html%3Fdate%3D2017-09-07">statistics of the liveinternet service</a> , the number of android devices is generally half of the total amount of devices and the actual android application creates a huge farm with auto-charging money and an incredible graphic resource. <br><br>  These were only thoughts in the ear, as I see the death of Bitcoin.  Maybe I was mistaken and bitcoin is being hammered by a protected protocol that is known only to the developer, but then dependence and centralization appear, which I suppose was ruled out, so it seems to me that bitcoins are forged not with something, but by some generally accepted principle and no matter what device and OS is used to calculate tasks on this principle. <br><br>  Correct me, please, if I misunderstand something. <br><br>  <b>PS:</b> judging by the <a href="https://yadi.sk/i/gTspDxy_3Mhc4k">statistics of Yandex.Worldwide,</a> people have not even thought about such a combination as bitcoin + playstation before, even to make sure that this is not possible, but for some reason I think it‚Äôs quite a real thought! <br><br>  <b>PPS:</b> I also heard someone even dialing from their TV receivers, that is, even a primitive channel listager and a signal decoder coped, and the playstation 3 is a targeted graphic unit with a market price of 3000 rubles due to the presence of new-fashioned playstation 4. <br><br>  <b>PPPS:</b> And judging by <a href="https://yadi.sk/i/bJMFEXKC3MhhQJ">how many people asked Yandex</a> in a bitcoin android combination, it seems that very few people knew about the application for androyd, and those who wrote bitcoin android generally wanted to start a wallet for themselves.  And the only problem is that the application should be called trite and immediately promoted with ordinary money without abstruse mining and investing in incomprehensible coins.  Simple but funny name is much more relevant!  Here it is a free, unlimited graphic resource in total but in the pocket of every independent inhabitant of the planet.  It is not necessary to look for computers cheaper, but more free resources and in a large quantity, and the value immediately disappears. <br><br>  Expect the depreciation of the graphic resource and as a result the collapse of Bitcoin quotes. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/337436/">https://habr.com/ru/post/337436/</a></p>
