But about the Open Data Council, it is quite possible to talk in more detail. <br><br>  Before I retell everything in my own words - look at the <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/infoculture/blog/198474/">official news,</a> there are some of the questions disclosed, and some I will tell you now. <br><br>  So, there were 3 big topics: <br>  1. Open Data of the Ministry of Culture <br>  2. Russia's Compliance with the G8 Charter Requirements <br>  3. Technical requirements for the open data portal from the Ministry of Economic Development of Russia

    <h4>  Open Data Ministry of Culture </h4><br><br>  Mikhail Gorodilov from the Ministry of Culture spoke and, in short, his speech can be reduced to the following theses: <br><ol><li>  <b>‚ÄúWe are open‚Äù</b> They just started to open these open data and have already placed something on the website of the Ministry of Culture - <a href="http://mkrf.ru/opendata/">mkrf.ru/opendata/</a> </li><li>  <b>‚ÄúDigital content is also data‚Äù</b> They promise a lot of digital content data and what they plan to digitize and create up to 280 terabytes per year </li><li>  <b>‚ÄúWe want money.‚Äù</b> It sounded quite unambiguously that the Ministry of Culture wants the work on the creation of open data, including from digital content, to be financed from the state program ‚ÄúInformation Society‚Äù. </li><li>  <b>‚ÄúWe want business to pay.‚Äù The</b> message is also very simple.  In order for a business that would potentially use their data, it would further also be involved in the financing of their creation.  Transparently hinted at Yandex and Google and other large Internet holdings </li></ol><br><br>  These are the simple thoughts sounded by the Ministry of Culture.  In this case, they, in fact, have a lot of data that it‚Äôs time to open, but so far they have not posted any of them.  Neither the state register of films, nor the cultural heritage database, nor much more.  The position is the same as that of Rosstat, only understanding is still less. <br><br>  Will they be given money?  I do not know.  This year, the Ministry of Finance cuts off all the financing and does not give money for new initiatives.  Do I need to press them to open what is already there?  I think it is necessary. <br><br><h4>  Charter G8 </h4><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  At the last meeting of the G8 heads of state, they signed the <a href="http://gov.uk/government/publications/open-data-charter/g8-open-data-charter-and-technical-annex">open data charter</a> (on Russian <a href="http://kremlin.ru/ref_notes/1483">on the Kremlin‚Äôs website</a> ), which declares the readiness of these governments to publish a significant amount of data as open data and the fact that open data generally becomes a priority in the openness of the authorities. <br><br>  But it is not enough to sign the charter, it is also necessary to bring the data into conformity with it.  Now there are several international and public ratings for which this openness will be measured.  Moreover, the charter contains many key and important provisions - open licenses, openness of data by default and the main priorities in what data should be open. <br><br>  Responsibility for implementing the open data charter has now fallen onto the Open Data Council, and therefore the priority steps and the roadmap for implementation have been discussed. <br><br>  In short, everything is simple.  Russia has undertaken international obligations and will open up on the key arrays listed in the Charter. <br>  In particular, steps are envisaged in the following directions: <br><ul><li>  publication of open election data (CEC) </li><li>  publication of open environmental monitoring data </li><li>  publication of open data of the public part of the Unified State Register </li><li>  adaptation of open licenses </li></ul><br>  and much more.  Not all of this will be easy, that's for sure. <br><br><h4>  Ministry of Economic Development and a single open data portal </h4><br><br>  The Ministry of Economic Development of Russia has long since produced technical requirements for an open data portal and recently <a href="http://zakupki.gov.ru/pgz/public/action/orders/info/common_info/show%3FnotificationId%3D7253006">announced a competition to create a portal</a> .  Malkov from Minek spoke at the council who talked about how well they discussed everything with the experts, how they had a good discussion of those requirements and much more. <br><br>  I could not resist and openly told them there that they were extremely disapproving of their concept and those.  requirements and that initially everything that happens is too sharpened by a single performer - Gosbuk, who recently won their own work on <a href="http://zakupki.gov.ru/pgz/public/action/orders/info/common_info/show%3Fsource%3DEPZ%26notificationId%3D6479166">methodological recommendations,</a> while they did not possess and do not possess any competences in this area. <br><br>  Actually, I personally have no doubt that they have been working in this direction for a long time, since the data.gov.ru domain is sent to their server and signed by HTTPS with their self-issued certificate.  Here you can check <br>  <a href="http://www.sslshopper.com/ssl-checker.html">www.sslshopper.com/ssl-checker.html#hostname=data.gov.ru</a> <br><br>  and see this picture <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a58/9de/009/a589de0096acdcbfea4a309883711700.png"><br><br>  The story is very ugly and the fact that it will be just such became clear in July 2013.  The Ministry of Economic Development did not hesitate to promote the ‚Äúopen data publishing tool‚Äù in the form of HTML generation tricks, inscribed the concept of monitoring of state sites where it was unnecessary and strongly discouraged from system development and integration with existing government systems and publishing data in Linked Data and so on. <br><br>  Unfortunately, the open data council cannot say anything to Ulyukaev or force the Ministry of Economic Development to perform its work decently, but at least I have the opportunity to voice the situation as it is, and not how the Ministry of Economic Development staff will want to submit it in the future. <br><br><hr><br><br>  This is not the last meeting of the council and I will definitely keep everyone informed of what is happening there. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/198644/">https://habr.com/ru/post/198644/</a></p>
