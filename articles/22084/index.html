  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Meeting with Google Russia CEO</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Yesterday in the main building of Moscow State University a meeting was held with Vladimir Dolgov, CEO of Google Russia.  After a half-hour presentation on "The trends of the Internet and the role of Google in this process", all visitors had the opportunity to ask questions to the head of the Russian representative office for one and a half hours.  Another theme of the event was ‚ÄúCareer.  Attitude to life.  History of success". <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  A lot of people gathered at the meeting, the seats went down quickly.  The presentation itself was surprisingly not boring, said Vladimir interestingly. <br><br><img src="http://motosetup.net/share/habr/google/1.jpg" alt="Vladimir Dolgov">

      Much of the material was devoted to marketing, however, the statistics paid no less attention.  The presentation began with a story about the theory of long tails, according to which in current realities it is wrong to limit the range of products.  An example was given with a musical apparatus in a cafe, reproducing any of the selected songs for money.  It turns out that with any number of tracks to choose from (50, 100 or 200 thousand), 98% of them will be listened to for some characteristic period of time.  Then we talked about the role of information sources in product promotion.  Until the mass media was widely distributed, one source of information (for example, a newspaper) acted on a fairly wide group of people, and later (with the advent of radio, television, etc.), the number of these sources increased.  With the advent of the Internet, marketing began to focus not on broad groups of people, but on a specific consumer. <br><br>  Then the conversation went directly to the Internet.  The frontier of 50 million Internet users overcame in 3 years, and, for example, radio in almost 40 years, which makes it possible to consider the worldwide network the fastest growing source of information.  According to statistics, 77% of users are now outside the US, and for 67% of them English is not their native language.  At the same time, Google sees its mission in an attempt to understand what exactly you wanted to find at your request and show the search results you need.  In particular, it is necessary to propose corrected versions of the request.  In this regard, an illustrative example is that Britney Spears on Google is looking for more than 800 different spellings. <br><br>  From the words of Vladimir, the Internet has provided a person the opportunity to become famous in 15 minutes.  This, of course, was about YouTube, and as an example, a parody of Shakira's clip was shown, the number of views of which was 1000 times higher than the number of views of the original.  Listeners were also told the news that Google does not generate content, but only tries to structure the information.  At the same time, the company itself believes that User-Generated Content is now more important than the brand. <br><br>  Another of the important directions of Google‚Äôs development is Clowded Computing, which is inseparably linked with a reduction in the cost of storing information.  Google Apps were shown here, in particular, the online equivalent of Word, Excel, and Paverpoint.  Not spared, and Google Books, the profit from which, as Vladimir said, for some reason is minus infinity. <br><br>  Finally left some interesting graphs.  Most of all I liked the comparison of server load on a regular and ‚Äúspecial‚Äù resurrection.  In the latter case, there are two sharp dips and a peak on the graph within 2-3 hours.  It turned out that this corresponds to two times and a break in the final of the World Cup. <br><br>  At this the main part ended and the questions began, mostly completely banal and uninteresting.  Most of all I liked the answer to the question about the main rivals of Google in Russia - ‚ÄúYou know who‚Äù.  Whether Samiznaekteko ‚Ñ¢ was meant, or someone else, history is silent.  Then I got bored and decided to ask why the W3C validator finds 57 errors on the main page of Russian Google.  On the one hand, it is absolutely clear that such questions are not within the competence of the head of the representative office, on the other - why not ask.  Vladimir's answer was somewhat surprised, he said that there are no clear standards and whether to follow them or not is a company's own business.  Maybe he just did not understand what was going on :) <br><br>  After the phrase in response to one of the questions that Google does not censor the Internet, I decided to ask why Google search results are blocked by some search results by queries of various US government organizations, if Google LLC is active in Russia and it acts according to our laws and it seems that no court rulings from the USA concern it.  For Vladimir, it turned out to be news that some results are still being blocked.  In response, he told something about US and European legislation in the field of copyright, according to which this very right to a book in Europe and the United States ends after a different number of years, and Google has to determine by IP whether to show the full page scan in the output or quote. <br><br>  And finally, when everything was already gone, I asked if the company would have enough safety margin if another dot-com collapse happened.  Vladimir said that Google is now quite diversified so that bad news from certain markets will not touch it, and it can only fall if everything is ruined. <br><br>  The meeting turned out to be quite interesting, contrary to my expectations.  We should also thank the organizing committee, who distributed all the gifts at the exit, to those who decided to leave an hour early, the rest simply did not get them.  True, I still dragged off just such a useless thing (in the book all Google services are described, and on the disk are distributions of programs): <br><br><img src="http://motosetup.net/share/habr/google/2.jpg" alt="Google Russia"></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/22084/">https://habr.com/ru/post/22084/</a></p>
