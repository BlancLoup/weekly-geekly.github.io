  <section class="page js-page"><h1>A brief history of ZTE: why you should trust the Chinese gadgets</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"> The Chinese company ZTE was founded in 1985, although even now it can hardly be called known in the Russian market.  In 2011, it was the second largest manufacturer of telecommunications equipment and mobile phones in China.  It is listed on the Shenzhen and Hong Kong Stock Exchanges, and is included in the Hang Seng China Enterprises Index. <br><br>  In addition, ZTE has 13 research centers in China, USA, Sweden and Korea, which spend 10% of annual income, and is a partner of Intel, Microsoft, IBM and Qualcomm. <br><br>  51.8% of ZTE shares belong to the PRC, and this means that the quality of products is monitored by the country's authorities.

In March 1993, the name was changed to Zhongxing New Telecommunications Equipment Co., Ltd ... ZTE received its current name later. <br><br>  In 1997, it placed shares on the Shenzhen Stock Exchange.  Seven years later, she entered the listing of the Hong Kong Stock Exchange. <br><br>  The company received most of the profits in the domestic market, but in 2004 it received money from the placement of shares on R &amp; D to enter the global market.  In 2006, ZTE took 40% of all new orders for equipment for CDMA networks, leading the global market in this industry.  Among the company's customers was the Canadian state-owned telecommunications company Telus, and ZTE itself entered the <a href="http://www.wi-fi.org/">Wi-Fi Alliance</a> . <br><br>  In 2007, ZTE sold equipment to British Vodafone, Spanish Telefonica, and Australian Telstra.  In 2008, ZTE customers were in 140 countries. <br><br>  In 2009, ZTE came in third place in the list of vendors of GSM equipment, and 20% of all this equipment sold in the world had a company logo. <br><br>  An interesting fact: the first smartphone with GPS / GLONASS on board was released by ZTE under the name of <a href="https://geektimes.ru/post/120171/">MTS Glonass 945</a> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/9e6/f39/905/9e6f39905d732479478e3f590b91436a.jpg" width="600" alt="image"><br><br>  ZTE claims to spend 10% of its annual income on R &amp; D.  The company's research centers operate in several countries, and the company has more than 48 thousand patent applications and 13 thousand patents.  In 2011 and 2012, ZTE received more patents than any other company.  This company is one of the largest manufacturers of telecommunications equipment in the world, but at the same time it is also a manufacturer of smartphones. <br><br>  In the 3rd quarter of 2015, <a href="http://zte.ru/company/press/news/ZTE-popadaet-v-desyatku/">according to Gartner,</a> ZTE sold 13.7 million smartphones and ranked 9th in the global ranking of manufacturers, having seized 2.9% of the global market. <br><br>  The company entered the Russian market about five years ago, but then they were branded mobile phones.  And now the company offers a range of budget phones and one powerful ZTE Axon Mini.  The fact is that a year ago Russia was not considered as a market where premium smartphones, flagships of the company, should be sold.  Instead, they chose to sell state employees and middle ones. <br><br>  For example, ZTE Blade V2 Lite.  This smartphone, priced at about seven thousand rubles, has a five-inch TFT screen with a resolution of only 854x480, only 1 GB of RAM and 8 GB of built-in.  But he boasts a 3400 mAh battery, two SIM cards and LTE support.  And weighing 150 grams - you can defend against Gopnik.  In terms of performance, Antutu benchmark placed it between the LG G3 and the HTC One. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/cb9/556/ced/cb9556cedbb323dbad018849c94a90fd.jpg" width="600" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/9b8/3ab/d91/9b83abd913b8c7f8b74c0503b508c556.png" width="300" alt="image"><br><br>  There were even less powerful gadgets that can be given to the child.  For example, ZTE Blade AF3 for three thousand rubles.  This gadget with 4 GB of memory and 512 MB of RAM is not a pity to give the daughter to be torn apart. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/006/899/a79/006899a79115442a15d8e439febe067b.jpg" width="600" alt="image"><br><br>  ZTE doesn't waste a lot of money on R &amp; D.  They were the first to introduce the owner's eye recognition system into the serial smartphone - in the ZTE Grand S3.  For this system, only a front camera of 1 megapixel is needed, so the phone does not cost more. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/86b/34d/da9/86b34dda9129e1b052bb9c9297fd222e.jpg" width="600" alt="image"><br><br>  But if you want a really efficient gadget with a good iron, then you need to look, of course, at the top ZTE devices.  The <a href="https://dronk.ru/shorten/hj">ZTE Axon Elite 4G</a> * <a href="https://dronk.ru/shorten/hj">smartphone</a> is based on the Qualcomm Snapdragon 810 processor (MSM8994) and has 3 GB of RAM and 32 GB of internal memory.  Main cameras - 13 megapixels and 2-megapixel auxiliary, front - 8 MP. <br><br>  The smartphone costs $ 379.89, but now you can buy it for 299.99. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/eab/fa2/28e/eabfa228e0d589e9661eba99182d423c.jpg" width="600" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/50a/0a9/794/50a0a979457f2e9c108de74ff1011ea8.jpg" width="600" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/5d3/2c2/f23/5d32c2f23a27f3bb81a59359b571a8c6.png" width="600" alt="image"><br><br>  About the same is the price of <a href="https://dronk.ru/shorten/hh">ZTE Nubia My PRAGUE Elite 4G</a> *.  It has a smaller screen - 5.2 inches, a Qualcomm Snapdragon 615 processor and two same cameras as the Axon - 13 and 8 megapixels.  Great gift for a woman on March 8. <br><br>  Yes, here on board 3 GB of RAM and 32 GB of internal, Full HD screen resolution and again LTE.  The memory can be expanded thanks to the slot for MicroSD, which is also a slot for the second SIM card. <br><br>  The screen is protected by Gorilla Glass 3. And the color is pleasant - called ‚ÄúShampagne‚Äù. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/b95/024/52a/b9502452aee1faa21180eaa4e16db929.jpg" width="600" alt="image"><br><br>  The ZTE Nubia Z7 phablet usually costs $ 761, but now there is a fabulous discount in the store - it is offered <a href="https://dronk.ru/shorten/hi">for 199.99</a> *. <br><br>  It is primarily characterized by the screen: at 5.5 inches, the resolution is 1440x2560 pixels.  Cameras - 13 and 4 MP.  The processor is a Snapdragon 801 Quad Core 2.5GHz.  And again, two SIM cards and LTE, 3 GB of RAM and 32 built-in.  Only microSD device does not support. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/1da/d6b/6ae/1dad6b6ae2e031232d01b2b415f73b5a.jpg" width="600" alt="image"><br><br>  Model <a href="https://dronk.ru/shorten/hc">ZTE Nubia Z9 Max</a> * has a full HD resolution of 5.5-inch screen, 2 GB of RAM and 32 GB of internal memory.  But the most interesting is the glass back panel.  The design is very concise.  The phone will cost 17,250 rubles. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/13f/271/203/13f2712036e1c32973183bad79ae630c.jpg" width="600" alt="image"><br><br>  Much cheaper will cost ZTE V5 with 2 GB of RAM, 16 GB of built-in, 5.5-inch Full HD screen, but a simpler design with a plastic case.  The device costs <a href="https://dronk.ru/shorten/hg">about 10,000 rubles</a> *.  Again you need to add that LTE smartphone supports. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/5f5/b2c/32e/5f5b2c32ed3e3095a99fd7191786606b.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  I myself tested several budget and medium-priced smartphones ZTE - Blade S6, Grand S2, quite cheap Blade AF3, Blade V2 Lite.  Yes, some had an ancient screen, but the build quality and overall impression always remained positive.  At IFA 2015 in Berlin, I touched news from ZTE, including Axon Elite - a great flagship from a company that has experience in telecommunications equipment.  So I can safely recommend gadgets from this manufacturer. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/723/614/e6e/723614e6e5fed2b421a3b38ad5250c32.jpg" width="600" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/0f1/0d9/e2e/0f10d9e2e5fc8e12edfe1d2942255327.jpg" width="600" alt="image"><br><br>  That's all, with you there was a simple service for choosing sophisticated <a href="https://dronk.ru/">Dronk.Ru</a> equipment.
