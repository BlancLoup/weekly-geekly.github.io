      The photo presented above is just a small part of Android devices tested in Animoca.  Yat Siu, head of Outblaze - Animoca's parent company, took a picture and published it while being in the main office of Outblaze.  According to Siu, in total, their studio has registered about 600 different Android devices in its network. <br><br>  ‚ÄúWe couldn‚Äôt find everything, because for the most part they are no longer available for sale,‚Äù he said. <br><br>  In addition, Siu said that the number of low-end phones from Asian manufacturers is also increasing rapidly.  Perhaps these are phone manufacturers, which Nokia CEO Stephen Elop spoke about in his <a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/tech-europe/2011/02/09/full-text-nokia-ceo-stephen-elops-burning-platform-memo/">famous ‚Äúburning platform‚Äù</a> when he mentioned that Chinese equipment manufacturers ‚Äúrelease new devices much faster than we do in PowerPoint presentations at Nokia.‚Äù  If they are not taken into account, then the actual number of devices that need to be tested is much lower. <br><br>  But, if you plan to enter the Asian markets, these phones are important, and there are additional difficulties for Android developers - they need to make sure that their application will work on each specific Android device.  Android fragmentation is a huge problem, as developers are forced to test their work on dozens of devices.  It so happens that Animoca supports Intel Capital and IDG-Accel, so they have the resources to buy all these devices for testing and pay their employees for using them. <br><br>  But imagine the rest of the "long tail" of developers!  Imagine all the people who created the remaining 500,000 apps for the Google Play store.  This is a nightmare. <br><br>  This calls into question the forecast of Eric Schmidt, given to them six months ago, that novice developers, in 6 months, will begin to choose Android as the first mobile platform for programming.  And now, six months have passed, but nothing like this happens.  Appcelerator surveyed 2,100 of its client-developers in March, and found that their <a href="http://apps4all.ru/analytics/appcelerator-idc-mobilnaya-razrabotka-1-kvartal-2012.html">interest in Android development</a> was in a state of stagnation. <br><br>  However, Siu is confused.  Earlier, he said that careful quality control of applications produced by Animoca, attracts and retains their users, as many other Android developers do not conduct such thorough tests.  Unlike iOS users who are used to wringing their hands in despair, writing devastating reviews and simply abandoning apps, Android users are usually happy when they find apps that just work, even if they have a couple of glitches. <br><br>  He added: " <a href="http://apps4all.ru/articles/google/android-fragmentation.html">We like fragmentation</a> as a choice for users. We are not sure that one size fits all." <br><br>  Here are more photos from the Pocket Gems company, which owns two of the 10 most profitable games on iOS last year.  Co-founder Harlan Crystal posted these photos.  Here are photos of iOS devices: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/ddd/2fc/e93/ddd2fce93f3ca4e9910659f27e371385.jpg"><br><br>  And they keep their Android devices in the safe.  But, apparently, there are so many of them now that the safe was overflowing.  Therefore, Crystal simply laid them on the table: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/ee8/9c7/a62/ee89c7a6260ce838d0ac0f4da3d340ec.jpg"></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/143770/">https://habr.com/ru/post/143770/</a></p>
