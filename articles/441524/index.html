As part of this work, the scientists transplanted the bone marrow of young mice to elderly individuals. <br><br>  As it turned out, after transplantation in elderly animals, memory and general cognitive abilities improved.  The comparison was carried out on the control group of mice, consisting of mice of similar age, which were not subjected to any modifications. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  In mice with transplanted bone marrow, the protection of brain cells has improved, their degradation has stopped.  The axons of brain neurons that appeared after transplantation were longer than those of nerve cells that developed before transplantation.

      In this way, neuron networks became more branched, which affected brain function.  Modified animals coped with performing cognitive tests better than mice from the control group. <br><br>  Further experiments have shown a possible cause of what is happening.  Blood cells produced by young bone marrow reduce the activation of <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259C%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BA%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B3%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B8%25D1%258F">microglia</a> , a specific type of immune cells in the brain.  Microglia supports the health of neurons, but with age it can become overactive and participate in the separation of synapses.  With less overactive microglia, the neurons will stay healthy and more synapses will survive. <br><br>  ‚ÄúAlthough previous studies have shown that blood transfusions from young mice to old ones improved the cognitive abilities of the latter, few could explain why this was happening,‚Äù <a href="https://eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2019-02/cmc-ybm021919.php">said</a> Helen Goodridge, a specialist from Cedars-Sinai Medical Center.  "Our research suggests that the reason lies in the specific properties of young blood cells." <br><br><h3>  Big "but" </h3><br>  Blood transfusion from young people to the elderly is a practice that has been for hundreds of years.  And as far as we know, there are no particularly obvious positive results in the ‚Äúrejuvenation‚Äù procedure. <br><br>  Not long ago, the Ambrosia Health clinic, which was engaged in just a blood transfusion from young men and women to elderly people, was <a href="https://futurism.com/the-byte/clinic-sells-blood-fda-warning">closed</a> .  As far as we know, patients remained dissatisfied with the work of the institution, since there were no results. <br><br>  Scientists have no data that may indicate that what is happening with mice will be repeated in the case of experiments with the participation of people.  And in order to obtain confirmation or refutation, a bone marrow transplant from the elderly is necessary, but it is still necessary for such an operation and permission to be obtained, which is not easy. <br><br>  Experts who conducted the study, believe that the experiments need to continue.  ‚ÄúWe live in a time when the population of people is gradually aging, the average age increases.  Accordingly, there are more cases of Alzheimer's disease.  Our work shows that cognitive abilities can be improved, ‚Äùthe study leader said. <br><br>  Scientists hope to solve the problem of bone marrow transplantation by creating specialized stem cells that will replace the ‚Äúold‚Äù cells in the bone marrow.  As a result, the bone marrow will rejuvenate and, perhaps, this will lead to an improvement in the cognitive abilities of older people. <br><br> <a href="http://madrobots.ru/%3Futm_source%3Dhabr.com%26amp%3Butm_medium%3Dpr%26amp%3Butm_campaign%3Dbrain"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/qq/g0/i7/qqg0i7eriq4febfjqqehire4fnw.png"></a> <br> <a href="http://madrobots.ru/about/mails/%3Futm_source%3Dhabr.com%26amp%3Butm_medium%3Dpr%26amp%3Butm_campaign%3Dbrain"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/bv/1y/yw/bv1yywjgl2_cbtzvvtk4rup2jz8.png"></a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/441524/">https://habr.com/ru/post/441524/</a></p>
