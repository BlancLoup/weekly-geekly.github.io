This post seemed quite funny to me, and I translated it, trying to preserve the author‚Äôs stylistics.  Please note that the publication of this review in no way expresses my opinion about Kevin Rose and his startup :-) </blockquote><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Today I could not go to sleep without taking all the crap out of Pownce.  The only thing that annoys me in this project is that it happened so that it exists on the same Internet that I use. <br><br>  Pownce is an online service that allows you to ‚Äúshare all sorts of things with your friends.‚Äù  If you translate it from the language of idiots, it will mean "the site on which you can leave notes, files and other crap for other users."  What?  Have you thought about FTP too?  Aha, that one, with a thousand, mlyat, nine hundred and seventy first!  Now it is wrapped in pastel colors, and you can use it only by invite. <br><br>  Pownce also looks a bit like Twitter, differing in the fact that you want to pick out your eyes with a fork from its user interface.  In addition, he gives a decent amount of 503-th.  Hooray!  Long live the People Shavaet!

      <strong>I do not hear you, reveling in my own coolness</strong> <br><br>  So, okay, let's look at the technical qualities of Pownce.  First of all, JavaScript, and a lot.  Yeah, about 30 kb of script written by Lee Culver.  It feels like Lee is a devoted fan of ‚Äúerratic programming,‚Äù in which you are not sure what you want to do.  Take, for example, this fragment: <br><br>  Yeah, we're not sure if we want to darken this message, we'll just leave useless comments in the working code, which will be useless by wire.  Why?  All our users have cable connection.  Yes, I will find fault with the delays.  Suck  Amateurs <br><br>  The maximum file size you can upload to your site is 10 MB, which is as useful as a tumor.  Files uploaded to the Internet are useless unless it is: <br><br>  <strong>Stop downloading</strong> <br><br>  Of course, you can upload a couple of mp3-shek to the site, but without the support of a larger size, all this functionality is zero.  Yes, by the way, for $ 20 a year you can get the right to upload files up to 100 mb in size.  Just awesome!  They use Amazon S3 hosting as storage, which will cost you $ 1.8 per year per gigabyte if you use it without the help of Pownce.  Is it a little expensive? <br><br>  Since we are talking about "free" web services, let's talk about the board.  Kevin, if you are reading this, read this line carefully: <strong>don‚Äôt make me sign in to PayPal to use your Lokhov service.</strong>  PayPal is the only hoofed web service. <br><br>  Yes, I almost forgot - when using a paid account, advertising is not shown.  Given that all potential users have already learned to ignore it quite well, this deal does not look so profitable. <br><br>  <strong>What the hell is this - Megatechtronium</strong> <br><br>  In theory, this is the name of the company developing Pownce.  Was the name ‚ÄúHypercompuglobalmeganet‚Äù already taken? <br><br>  And I said that Pownce sucks in full and in terms of speed, suitable for normal use?  The delay is just shameful: up to 15 seconds when loading some pages.  If you sell advertising, the delay should be no more than 500 ms.  IS ALWAYS.  But here it doesn‚Äôt matter - it is Web 2.0. <br><br>  You can also use some program that works with the service.  With it, you can send and receive messages.  Yes, I know what is already funny, but listen further, now the real annealing will begin.  If you wanted to write a program that uses shared dynamic libraries and runs on all platforms, which language would you choose?  Yeah, I also answered "java". <br><br>  But if you are Lee Culver, Daniel Burka or Sean Allen, then it is quite possible that you would answer ‚ÄúAIR‚Äù.  What is AIR?  This is an abbreviation for Adobe Integrated Runtime (Adobe Integrated Dynamic Library).  This is a platform-independent dynamic library that is not installed anywhere.  To use the Pownce desktop application, you will have to install this library, but this is not all, they have enough audacity to ask: ‚ÄúDon't you know if you have it?  If you are not sure, then most likely you have not installed it. ‚Äù  Which translates as ‚ÄúWe strongly want to push through the support of this library, so let's download.  Honestly, this is the future, it's like RealPlayer in the field of video. ‚Äù <br><br>  <strong>REMOVE FROM THE INTERNET</strong> <br><br>  The funny thing is how I got an invitation to Pownce.  My colleague had an account with several invites, which she distributed right and left, until there were -50 invites left.  A negative number.  What a wonderful boundary check.  Was it done on purpose?  Yes-aa ... already poh. <br><br>  Let's now see how our web-fool will play with this toy. <br><br>  #uncov on freenode.  Come in and say hello. <br><br>  Cross post from <a href="http://www.diggreader.ru/">my blog</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/31143/">https://habr.com/ru/post/31143/</a></p>
