      My name is Baubatrina Irina Vladimirovna, I am the owner of an Internet network of resources that are located on the servers of Ukraine Host LLC.  I have been using the services of this company for more than four years, and so far I have been satisfied with this cooperation. <br><br>  However, with this letter I want to draw your attention to the unlawful and inappropriate actions of employees of the Ukraine Host LLC organization, which is part of the Russian company Hosting Center RBC. <br><br>  06/14/2009 An employee of my organization discovered that my account (infosetcom) on hc.ua is blocked, although I did not receive any information about the reasons for blocking.  Immediately I wrote and sent a letter to the technical support service (support@hc.ua) <br><br>  Text of the letter: <br><br>  Hello <br>  I would like to get an explanation of why the account (infosetcom) of the hosting and the domain infoset.com.ua was blocked. <br>  I absolutely do not understand the motivation for blocking, access to the admin panel (c-panel), access to ftp, access to change the DNS domain is blocked. <br>  Explain why you have blocked this account (infosetcom)? <br><br>  Sincerely, Baubatrin I.V. <br><br>  15.06.2009 In order to clarify my rights, as well as the rights and obligations of Ukraine Host LLC with respect to customers, I tried to find on the website of this organization Ukraine Host LLC at the email address (www.hc.ua) which documents Relationships of the parties on the page (documents) where these documents would supposedly be (http://hc.ua/documents/index.jsp), they simply do not exist, therefore, it is not possible to obtain intelligible publicly available information about the rights and obligations of the parties. <br><br>  I didn‚Äôt receive a reaction from the administration of Ukraine Host LLC for two weeks sent by my employee a letter of June 15, 2009 with a request to explain the reason for blocking my account (infosetcom). <br><br>  06/18/2009 I called the number +38 (044) 593-32-20 indicated on the website of Ukraine Host LLC, as a multichannel one, the girl called herself an employee of the finance department picked up the phone and informed me that my account has subscriber debt board, so that it was blocked.  To my statement that I had paid for the provision of hosting and domain name renewal in a timely manner, as evidenced by the payment receipts in my hand (attached to this letter), the aforementioned employee simply hung up.  Repeated calls to the same number were simply ignored. <br><br>  06/19/2009 I called the same number, again asking for the reason for blocking the account.  An employee who introduced himself as Chief Executive Officer to Artur Kuznetsov stated that the account was blocked personally by him, but he could not tell me the objective reason for the blockage, and also could not argue his actions in this situation.  I told him that I intend to come to the Ukraine Host office in order to sort out the current situation with more competent employees, to which he responded extremely inadequately, frankly rude, to put it coarsely obscene language, threatening with physical violence and extorting money in the amount of 500 UAH , for unlocking an account and access to the management of the domain infoset.com.ua.  Specifically, the phrase was sounded: ‚ÄúIf someone arrives at the office of the company, then she will receive pi ... s, along with a written undertaking not to leave the place‚Äù.  Since, in his words, he is a former law enforcement officer and can ruin the life of anyone. <br><br>  06/23/2009 After another call to Ukraine Host LLC, which did not shed light on this situation, I received an SMS message from a free Internet service owned by KievStar with the following text: ‚ÄúFrom ... ka, once again you will call with your requests account, we'll come and give you pi ... s, you understand me?  Or lava and domain, or them ... I you will not get. " <br>  (spelling and grammar of the original saved) <br>  After that, I repeatedly called the same number (+38 (044) 593-32-20), but it did not give any results: either the competent employee was not in the workplace, they were asked to call back later, or they simply hung up.  In spite of such extremely incorrect actions of the employees of Ukraine Host LLC, I managed to convince one girl to write down my contact details with a personal request to this elusive ‚Äúcompetent employee‚Äù to contact me to clarify this conflict.  Naturally, no reaction followed. <br><br>  So, dear management of the RBC Hosting Center, I still would like to hear a plausible explanation regarding the incident. <br>  Due to the aforementioned events, the Internet resource belonging to me fell out of the index of search engines, it became unavailable to the target audience (which is almost half a million people a month!), And this is the work of the last five years of my life.  Because of the outright outrage of some of your employees, I suffer not only material losses every day, but my professional reputation also suffers. <br><br>  You can be sure that I will try so that as many people as possible know about the hosting of RBC Hosting Center, its branches and employees towards customers. </blockquote><br>  That's it.  From what I was trying to find out, the Ukraine-Host LLC is indicated in the information about the domain by administrative and technical contact.  The person with whom I spoke said that they had asked the hoster several times to register the necessary nickname in the domain information, but this did not lead to anything. <br><br>  I also went to the HC.UA billing panel (they gave me a login / password), there really is information that such an account exists but is blocked, there is also information about payment.  I also received a lot of screenshots, scans of a passport and other documents, including this <a href="">receipt</a> (upd: <a href="">or here</a> , otherwise my blizzard contusion from habraeffektu) and this <a href="">screenshot</a> .  The fact that the screenshot is not a fake, I confirm. <br><br>  I say right away - I have nothing against RBC Ukraine (there was a true <a href="http://www.nayjest.ru/domains/palki-v-kolesa">misunderstanding</a> ), I myself am their client and I have no intention of slandering them.  I only bring to the public‚Äôs eyes what they have sent me and what they have told me, with all the accompanying data, if they can serve as evidence. <br><br>  From other information about the domain, which I dug: <br>  Yandex TIC: 10, <br>  The number of indexed pages in google: 6 530 <br>  That is, there was definitely a site with a large amount of content. <br>  You can still see what is <a href="">stored in the web arahiva</a> , but there are copies of pages only for 2007. <br><br>  I think <b>it can not be left just like that</b> .  What do you think about that? <br><br>  upd: Habrapheme <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/auren/" class="user_link">Auren</a> expressed a desire to give Irina Vladimirovna an invite, for which he thanks a lot, otherwise I am already tired of working as a copy copier and at the same time spell checker. <br><br>  upd2: <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/badboom/" class="user_link">badboom is</a> already with us to answer all questions in the comments. <br><br>  upd3: I certainly have nothing against RBC Ukraine, but now I‚Äôm thinking about transferring my domains from them or they will react adequately ... <br><br>  upd4: HC.UA <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/hosting/63937/">official response</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/63917/">https://habr.com/ru/post/63917/</a></p>
