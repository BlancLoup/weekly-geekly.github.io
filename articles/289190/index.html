      More and more specialists in various fields are beginning to understand the importance of not only competent <a href="http://blog.mbaconsult.ru/blog/personal/12-sovetov-dlya-povysheniya-produktivnosti-pozvolyayushchikh-kontrolirovat-svoy-rabochiy-den/">distribution of working time</a> , but also a creative approach to work. <br><br>  There are three ways that help unleash creativity, tune for success and help <a href="http://blog.mbaconsult.ru/blog/personal/kak-dobitsya-bolshego-delaya-menshe/">achieve excellent results</a> with minimal cost. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0071c5">Be aware of everything</font> </h2><br>  The day consists of many hours, so why not use this time with maximum benefit?  Thus, everything seen and done at work or at home can serve as a potential catalyst that triggers the information contained in the head.  The love of reading is very helpful in this regard.  Home library, reading articles online and subscribing to all sorts of publications, blogs and podcasts. <br><br>  Even such a simple lesson as reading news on social networks will serve as a source of information.  You may not understand where this or that idea came from.  The reason for its occurrence may be something once seen, said or read. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0071c5">Draw parallels</font> </h2><br>  You can take a magazine and browse it at the grocery store, pick some spicy news and establish relationships. <br><br>  Sometimes inspiration and emerging parallels come from an unexpected side.  A case from personal experience.  Once I bought an architectural magazine for my husband.  When he leafed through, she accidentally ran into an article.  It had two or three sentences that complemented the idea that was already in my head.  It turned out very well, since I was able to use this material for a new article. <br><br>  Steve Jobs once said: "Creativity is the union of several things."  Probably need to be like Steve and combine things in everyday life.  You can carry a small notebook and a pen to record thoughts, observations and connections that occur in your head. <br><br>  It is important to collect all the ideas in one place.  It helps to always stay organized and achieve your goals.  The main thing is to create some kind of common reservoir with useful contents, which you will use once, and then you will turn to it again and again. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0071c5">Implement ideas</font> </h2><br>  When there is a great idea, and something has already taken shape in your head, you need to decide how to put it into practice.  What will the idea look like in reality?  Will it be something like a blog post for potential buyers or will it become a tool for training internal staff? <br><br>  Is it possible to understand the main topic from the newsletter?  Is this information useful for filling up a corporate podcast or will it trigger a launch of a series of videos? <br><br>  It is worth thinking about all the possible ways of applying information, making the most of your creative potential and time. <br><br>  Ask the question ‚ÄúWho is the potential audience?‚Äù And ‚ÄúWhy do we need an idea, what will it lead to?‚Äù <br><br>  Knowledge of the potential audience helps to understand what the content should be, in what form to present it, to whom this information may be interesting, where it should be placed and how to promote it. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0071c5">Increase productivity</font> </h2><br>  Changing the purpose of something without adjusting the content is a sure way to increase the effectiveness of your work and the <a href="http://blog.mbaconsult.ru/blog/personal/potryasayushchaya-produktivnost-5-sposobov-povysheniya-komandnoy-proizvoditelnosti/">productivity of the whole team</a> . <br><br>  How to increase work efficiency and move to a new level <br><ul><li>  <b>Write down all the ideas and thoughts so that they do not evaporate.</b>  Of course, a professional in his case sometimes has more grief than the loss of a brilliant idea.  However, inspiration comes and goes, so seize the moment. </li><li>  <b>Treasure your ideas as much as time.</b>  Time has a price, ideas too.  It is necessary to find a source of inspiration, to generate new ideas, to unite them, to imagine what will come out of them, in a word, to actively manage them. </li><li>  <b>Do not work more, work wisely.</b>  This is a sure way to decompose the whole process in your head on the shelves, become more resourceful and eventually start working creatively. </li></ul><br>  And when do you work most productively?  Write in the comments. <br><br>  PS We recommend another article on the topic - The <a href="http://blog.mbaconsult.ru/blog/personal/sekret-o-tom-kak-vsye-delat-vovremya/">secret about how to do everything on time.</a> <br><br>  Translated by Vyacheslav Davidenko, founder of <a href="http://www.mbaconsult.ru/">MBA Consult</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/289190/">https://habr.com/ru/post/289190/</a></p>
