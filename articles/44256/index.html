  <section class="page js-page"><h1>On the eve of the Militia Day in Moscow 10 thieves were crowned at once</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Exactly two months after the President of Russia Dmitry Medvedev signed the Decree ‚ÄúOn some issues of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Russian Federation‚Äù, according to which the system of regional UBOPs was eliminated, the policemen had to reap the bitter fruits of state policy in the fight against organized crime and leaders criminal environment.  As soon as the scale of the country was eased, the control over the activity of ‚Äúthieves in law‚Äù was weakened, as they threw a challenge unprecedented in their audacity to the entire law enforcement system of Russia. <br>  On the eve of the Militia Day, an event occurred in Moscow, in comparison with which the October cabal in the Vladimir central with a ‚Äúthieving approach‚Äù to one of the ‚Äúpostozhentsy‚Äù, will seem like an innocent prank.  As the Prime Crime news agency learned, on November 6 a large ‚Äúthieves‚Äô gathering ‚Äùof representatives of the clan Ded Hasan took place.  On the agenda among the urgent problems associated with internecine disassembly, stood alone the question of replenishing the "fraternal" series.  Immediately 10 young applicants were nominated for the "thieves" title.  The "attestation commission" includes such leading figures of criminal law as Plum, Kostya Gizya, Yura Pichuga and Chikora from Moscow, envoys from the Nizhny Novgorod region: Wagon, Vasya Voskres and Hamlet, delegate from the Ural region - Timur Tbilisi and guest from Kuban - Roma Kashchey .  The meeting was held under the general chairmanship of Ded Hassan.  As a living icon of the Russian "thieves' world" at the "gathering" there was a "thief" Glory Japanese.  Following the meeting, all ten successfully defended applicants accepted congratulations from senior colleagues. <br>  Among the lucky owners of the honorary title were three close relatives of the existing ‚Äúthieves in law‚Äù: Edik Tbilisi‚Äôs son Sergei Osetrin, Dato Kutaisi‚Äôs nephew Emzar of Rostov and Timur Tbilisi‚Äôs nephew Gia Sverdlovsky.  The issue was finally resolved in favor of the Kyrgyz criminal leader Kamchi Kolbaev.  The names of the remaining neophytes: Jacko Tbilisi, Yusuf Baku, Vova Zyuza, Oleg Sukhach, Vasya Moldavan and Vadik Krasnodar.  In addition to the Moscow ‚Äúgathering‚Äù by ‚Äúthieves‚Äù Raul and Guram who were in Balashov's prison, a ‚Äúapproach‚Äù to Zurab Kutaisi was taken.  Total in the "thieves" elite included 11 new faces. <br>  Such a massive "coronation" of young authorities is an unprecedented case in the modern history of Russia.  Over the next three days, the names of the newly minted "lawyers" were sent to all Russian camps and prisons.  At the same time, an increase in the ‚Äúthieves'‚Äù movement, unprecedented since the mid-90s, has been observed in prisons. <br>  The fact of holding lush "thieves" christening and giving them wide publicity on the eve of the police holiday can only say that today the "thieves in law" felt such confidence in their strength, which they could not have before.  The reason for this is not only the ‚Äúindecent‚Äù wealth of modern ‚Äúthieves in law‚Äù that gives rise to impunity, but also the abolition of the only power structure - the UBOP, which the ‚Äúthieves‚Äù were forced to reckon with.  The high number of new ‚Äúthieves‚Äù converts is not just a reinforcement of a single ‚Äúthieves family‚Äù, it is a clear testimony of the triumph of the ‚Äúthieves idea‚Äù. </div>
