Unlike cockroaches, they lead a social life: they build nests, jointly care for their offspring and distribute responsibilities among family members.  The social hierarchy and lifestyle of termites are the subject of close study, and scientists have managed to pick up another element of this puzzle.  <a href="http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article%3Fid%3D10.1371/journal.pone.0156847">Fossil remains of nests</a> built by termites 25 million years ago <a href="http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article%3Fid%3D10.1371/journal.pone.0156847">have been found</a> on the exposed rocks of the rift basin of the drainless Lake <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A0%25D1%2583%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B0_(%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B7%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE)">Rukwa</a> in southwestern Tanzania. <br><br>  A detailed study of the nests showed that, next to the residential area in the nest, there are fenced mushroom plantations with an intricate system of fields constructed in accordance with a complex plan.  It is known that this culture of fungi can grow in such conditions <i>only under the condition of cultivation</i> .  This is the most real farming in its usual form, but only on a microscale. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Thus, termites grew their food 25 million years ago, long before the appearance of people.  According to researchers, this is the oldest evidence of agriculture on the planet.  Perhaps it was the termites who belonged to the invention of agriculture, and not to people.

According to new estimates, this symbiosis began about 31 million years ago, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/speaking-of-science/wp/2016/06/23/termites-figured-out-farming-25-million-years-before-people-did/">says</a> Eric Roberts, a geologist at Australian University James Cook, lead author of the scientific work. <br><br>  In virtually all of Africa, massive, edible "thermite mushrooms" are widely known, which are grown for themselves by tiny insects.  But scientists until the middle of the 20th century did not understand the true meaning of these objects and what actually happens in the termites colonies. <br><br>  When biologists cut and carefully examined thermite mounds (termitaries), sometimes as tall as a man, they found dozens of mutually united chambers built specifically for breeding mushrooms. <br><br>  It turned out that termites form an obligate symbiotic relationship with this particular type of fungi, that is, they cannot live without each other.  Termites chew on indigestible plant material and form tiny granules of it - milosphere, which are seeded with tiny mushroom spores.  When the mushrooms grow, the working terms harvest, and then the whole colony eats it.  In the process of growth, the mushrooms at the same time break down the previously inedible plant material, making it edible.  According to experts, in this way termites process up to 90% of dry wood in semi-arid savannah ecosystems, which makes termites a powerful landscape-transforming force. <br><br>  Previous studies of molecular biologists on mitochondrial DNA made it possible to suggest the emergence of such obligate symbiotic relations of termites with fungi about 25-30 million years ago.  But so far there has been no physical evidence that agriculture from termites appeared during that time period.  The most ancient fossilized mounds of termites dated to the Late Miocene, that is, 7-10 million years ago. <br><br>  To obtain such evidence, important for evolutionary history, a <a href="http://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward%3FAWD_ID%3D1349825%26HistoricalAwards%3Dfalse">grant</a> was allocated <a href="http://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward%3FAWD_ID%3D1349825%26HistoricalAwards%3Dfalse">from the</a> National Science Foundation for an international expedition to Lake Rukva with the famous rift, a large linear depression in the earth's crust, which was formed at the point of rupture of the crust as a result of its extension or longitudinal movement. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/3b9/596/e88/3b9596e88fe34aa99bf85f5c9e8e4047.png"><br>  <i>Location of the Great Rift Valley</i> <br><br>  In the ancient hollow of Tanzania‚Äôs Lake Rukwa, biologists have found fossils of thermite structures built millions of years ago.  Among them were two thermite farms.  Very well-preserved nests once inhabited termites.  Each of the nests contained several chambers about the size of a tennis ball, and in them were fossilized mushrooms and granules of plant material, the milospheres, which were used to breed mushrooms.  On the surrounding stones, scientists have determined the time of construction of thermite farms: 25 million years. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/87e/22a/6c7/87e22a6c74b144b1b4a4c6dab61c0330.jpg"><br>  <i>The structure and composition of the surviving milosphere</i> <br><br>  Scientists believe that thanks to farming, termites managed to survive and thrived in rapidly changing environmental conditions.  The ecosystem was transformed from lush tropical forests to arid semi-desert, but thanks to fungi, termites successfully turned dried wood into food for themselves. <br><br>  Becoming farmers, termites were much better adapted to life in any conditions, which contributed to their rapid spread throughout the continent. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/035/7a8/82f/0357a882facb49548fc41ca3c11da839.jpg"><br>  <i>Termites</i> <br><br>  By the way, termites were not the only creatures that practiced agriculture and planted mushrooms for wood processing.  The same thing was done by <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A1%25D0%25BF%25D0%25B8%25D1%2581%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BA_%25D0%25BC%25D1%2583%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B2%25D1%258C%25D1%2591%25D0%25B2-%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B8%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D0%25BE%25D1%2580%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B7%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2">leaf cutter ants</a> in the Americas.  About 10 million years ago, they began to grow <i>Leucocoprinus</i> mushrooms from the <i>Agaricaceae</i> family in ant hills, fertilizing them with the help of the             rin. )). <br><br>  Scientists also suspect that about the same tens of millions of years ago began to make <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ambrosia_beetle">flat-bugs</a> , which carry sporangia on themselves for storing spores of symbiotic tree-destroying fungi. <br><br>  The study of agricultural farms of termites with an age of 25 million years shows that the cultivation of food by social insects has evolutionary advantages - it allows us to survive in difficult natural conditions and establish colonies in almost any climate.  Termites settled all the continents on the planet, except Antarctica. <br><br>  About 24,988,000 years after termites, people also discovered this winning strategy. <br><br>  The scientific work was <a href="http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article%3Fid%3D10.1371/journal.pone.0156847">published</a> on June 22, 2016 in the journal <i>PLOS One</i> (doi: 10.1371 / journal.pone.0156847). </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/395679/">https://habr.com/ru/post/395679/</a></p>
