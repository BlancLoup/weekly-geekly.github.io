  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Tiles on the tablet. Acer Iconia Tab W700 Review</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  I remember back in 2007, I very much dreamed of a laptop with a touch screen.  Poke the stylus in the icons was cool.  Then I dreamed of the HTC Shift, then HP Touchsmart tm2 (laptop with swiveling touchscreen) appeared, and then the iPad appeared.  And rushed.  Crowds of Chinese, first on windows xp, then on windows 7, then - on android they began to rivet the tablets.  Of course, for the tablets were all sorts of shells, add-ins and so on.  Google released Android Honeycomb - tablet-centric, and iOS was drunk for pleasant work with the big screen.  Everything went on as usual.  Tablets were mobile devices, with mobile OS.  However, the giant from Redmond (Microsoft) released Windows 8 in 2012 (as well as its ARM version - Windows RT). <br>  Now you can poke a finger in Windows! <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/611/494/0ba/6114940bac369fa6e8929212d913b203.jpg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Of course, the first devices on windows 8 were good old laptops, ultrabooks.  But the tablets were not long in coming.  And now, one of the first, I got a tablet on Windows 8 - Acer Iconia Tab W700. <br>  The first impression of the box: wow!  Large box, heavy and roomy. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/a4b/bc0/fea/a4bbc0fea486c06cf3b0aab36d484591.jpg"><br>  Roomy is not the right word.  Inside, I found: a tablet, a charger, a docking station, a stand, a case, a microHDMI-D-Sub adapter, a keyboard, microfiber, four disks and a stack of papers. <br>  Let's take it in order. <br><br><h1>  Device </h1><br>  The tablet itself is also heavy, large and roomy.  Dimensions w700 295x191x12 mm.  On the one hand, this is a fat man for a tablet, but for such a filling it is one more ultrabook! <br>  Weight - about 950 grams.  Which, again, for the tablet a lot, but for the ultrabook - very cool! <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/c1c/8c1/24d/c1c8c124df3b0001848fa80ac9dbd7c2.jpg"><br>  The charger is like an ultrabook, a large, thick power cable, a medium-sized unit, and a thin wire up to the charging connector. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/c52/c4b/566/c52c4b566dc7cc0fc047d2eba2d5717a.jpg"><br><br><h1>  Case </h1><br>  The case is brown, in my opinion cumbersome. <br>  There are no clasps in the cover of the cover, everything is held up by heartless gravity. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/1cd/85f/1f8/1cd85f1f843c053af8ee33b8db66982c.jpg"><br>  The cover is made of high quality materials.  I will not say for the naturalness of the skin, but it does not stink and does not crumple. <br>  The tablet is placed in a case on the ‚Äúears‚Äù and sits firmly.  Do not fall out. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/7d5/771/7fd/7d57717fd97ab8e7bfaf76afc0855771.jpg"><br>  Attachment ears are additionally softened with a cloth so that your precious does not scratch. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/a8d/ecf/98a/a8decf98aee1555c599078b9a495a69f.jpg"><br>  There is a connector for the stylus (the handle does not fit there), as well as a window for the camera (it is closed with a valve over the entire width of the tablet), here is the valve - it is with velcro. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/bf4/730/2d8/bf47302d80ae811991cfb7a251f3add7.jpg"><br>  In the operating mode, the angle of inclination of the tablet can be adjusted by two grooves on the cover of the case, as well as by bending the bend edge (it is better to look at the photo).  Thus, there are 4 positions of the angle of the tablet in the case. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/6da/901/b0b/6da901b0bcd2dba9f570a8ec5efde803.jpg"><br>  During the discussion it turned out that there is the possibility of another, undocumented position. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/425/e5a/694/425e5a6945e068b56931eb3f7e9a8e55.jpg"><br>  The case is comfortable, but too cumbersome, making the already large tablet just huge.  But thanks to Acer for this - I don‚Äôt have to run to the store.

    <h1>  Dock station </h1><br>  Docking station and stand for it - also a nice option.  Yes, it is an option.  There is an option to buy a tablet without these ‚Äúbuns‚Äù. <br>  The tablet is installed in the dock by ‚Äúapproaching‚Äù along the guides, connecting to the USB and charger connectors. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/1a4/61b/f99/1a461bf9926a98612069331ae568e311.jpg"><br>  Doc, thanks to a clever stand, can be put in two positions.  Vertically and horizontally. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/f55/682/935/f556829353cfb6e79d417b3d8d95ea83.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/0b6/088/8d2/0b60888d2984450c194ac50b6b1ab87e.jpg"><br>  The dock itself is the most convenient thing, but from the connectors on it there is only charging and USB.  The dock itself is equipped with three USB 3.0 connectors. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/084/df0/6a8/084df06a8134df1b28cc6c38e7749ff4.jpg"><br>  Thus, you can leave the charging dock in the dock, the periphery (in the form of flash drives and mice), and you can carry the tablet with you when you come to work including it to the dock, getting your workplace on a large monitor.  Although here we stumble over the absence of an HDMI, DVI or at least D-Sub connector in the docking station. <br>  Yes, of course, there is a MicroHDMI-D-Sub adapter in the kit, but you cannot leave it in the dock (because it connects directly to the tablet).  Why not make this dock connector? <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/42e/50e/c67/42e50ec67331589bd6a3d6e7e3ac5553.jpg"><br>  I also want to note the flipness of the stand, and in general, the dock is empty (the feeling that 95% of the dock is air).  However, in defense I want to say that I am very used to the dock and the mode I described above (as always the same PC everywhere) is very convenient and correct.  The dock also made acoustic tricks that enhance the sound when the tablet is in the dock.  It really helps. <br><br><h1>  Other </h1><br>  The keyboard included with the Acer W700 is wireless, inexorably reminiscent of the Apple Wireless Keyboard.  Unfortunately, it differs from the last material and assembly (not for the better). <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/02d/afc/d83/02dafcd83dfbab5952d5920302860e61.jpg"><br>  The keyboard works via Bluetooth, the buttons are comfortable, the key travel is pleasant, fairly quiet. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/5d0/cd5/7b8/5d0cd57b85da9932f7d12d1e570381ee.jpg"><br>  Yes, there is no mouse in the kit, it is a bit strange, although it is leveled by an excellent touch screen. <br><br><h1>  Small retreat </h1><br>  The discs that are included - they are not without reason.  If you have something broken or just need to ‚Äúreinstall Windows‚Äù (well, you understand), then Windows 8 has a wonderful and handy tool invented - just press the button in the ‚Äúcomputer settings‚Äù and get the desired in 30-40 minutes.  However, here you will find disappointment.  To save space on the SSD drive, all the information for recovery has been transferred ... To DVDs.  That is, to restore the system you will need an external USB-drive. <br>  I'll tell you separately how to restore the system.  Not everything is as simple as it seems. <br>  Among the recovery discs are: Support DVD, Recovery DVD 1, Recovery DVD 2, Recovery DVD (Russian language pack).  So here.  It is necessary to recover as follows: <br>  1. Choose boot from disk. <br>  2. Insert the Support DVD. <br>  3. Loaded shell Acer eRecovery.  There you choose the desired language and what to restore. <br>  4. Remove the support DVD.  Insert the Recovery DVD 1. <br>  5. Remove the Recovery DVD 1. Insert the Recovery DVD 2. <br>  6. Take out the Recovery DVD 2. Insert the Revocery DVD (language pack). <br>  7. Take out the Recovery DVD (language pack).  Insert a support DVD. <br>  8. Reboot.  Waiting for the installation of all Acer utilities. <br>  9. Rejoice. <br>  The procedure takes from an hour to two.  Awful, but what to do.  Better not to kill the system. <br><br><h1>  The main thing </h1><br>  But let's go back to the most important - the hero of the review.  Tablet! <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/0a5/17e/a22/0a517ea224e35668231c740f3aebd17e.jpg"><br>  The Acer W700 is an aluminum case, toughened glass, a multi-touch FullHD display of 11.6 inches (IPS matrix), two cameras, two speakers, two microphones, two cores, 4 gigabytes, but yes let's do it in order. <br>  The case is aluminum, thanks to this the tablet acquires not only a stylish appearance, but also a tangible nobility. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/766/769/be5/766769be5d0a037920a636a1b9103ae8.jpg"><br>  Aluminum is everywhere except on the front side (there is Gorilla Glass 2 glass), well, in the place where there are wi-fi (a / b / g / n) and bluetooth 4.0 antennas. <br>  The front of the tablet is Gorilla Glass 2 glass, which covers an 11.6-inch IPS FullHD display.  With this display size, the resolution is wonderful.  True, even a little too small. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/fce/ef2/8b8/fceef28b8213a1dbcd70ecc48ec5171b.jpg"><br>  Also, on the front side there is a button that causes a ‚Äústart‚Äù in Windows. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/2b5/585/19a/2b558519a6d1b225130fb4127525f73a.jpg"><br>  Yes, there is still the ousted Acer logo. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/712/914/dcb/712914dcbf03f1c1446ef18843784f19.jpg"><br>  The display - once again - wonderful.  Yes, all your retina in aypedy and google nexus 10 - steeper, but only by numbers. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/611/494/0ba/6114940bac369fa6e8929212d913b203.jpg"><br>  Above the display is the front camera, and on the back cover is the main camera. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/f10/fb6/6cf/f10fb66cf01829d3abc96194fe244d65.jpg"><br>  The main camera allows you to take pictures in 5 MP, and write video in FullHD. <br>  The quality of both cameras is mediocre. <br><br>  Sample snapshots <a href="">HERE</a> <br><br>  On the left side of the tablet - the main connectors - for charging, USB 3.0 (both of these connectors are connected to the dock), microHDMI connector. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/09e/d32/d22/09ed32d22a34c7b41655a7f84588e3b2.jpg"><br>  On the right side there is a headphone jack (headset), a volume rocker (with tactile pimples) as well as a power button. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/e64/4d2/5ca/e644d25ca922c5401ef2fc5377acc7ed.jpg"><br>  On the inclusion, I want to say separately that the Acer w700 comes out of sleep in 1.5 seconds, and it hits the network in 2.5 seconds.  And this is really convenient. <br>  The upper bound is a lever for blocking an autoturn, as well as two grilles (air intake and ventilation). <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/b8b/034/dc4/b8b034dc46d27cc60d409ef04d3ac7f1.jpg"><br>  Since the processor is installed in the tablet adult (Core i5-3317U), then the cooling it requires a normal - active.  To my credit, I can say that the cooler is barely audible at all.  And blowing air is up.  Generally does not interfere. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/236/845/861/2368458610e65c1f7ee444683adcd170.jpg"><br>  The lower bound is two fucking speakers (three round holes each with a red grid), and a microphone. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/f65/6a5/72c/f656a572c282a43ba01fabe8141dfa9d.jpg"><br>  The speakers are really the most stylish element of the tablet after the case material. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/ef8/c51/b6d/ef8c51b6d6a7e73fbc7180bfb62cf6a1.jpg"><br>  The sound from the stereo speakers is a feature of Dolby Home Theater.  In games, movies, while listening to music, I was completely satisfied.  Ayped and Nexus 10 nervously smoking on the sidelines. <br><br><h1>  Insides </h1><br>  The insides are, as already noted, the Intel Core i5-3317U.  The processor is made on 22 nm process technology, 2 cores, 4 threads.  Clock frequency 1.7 GHz, TurboBoost up to 2.6 GHz, thermal package 17 watts. <br>  RAM 4 GB DDR3. <br>  The hard disk (or rather SSD) is a 128 GB solid-state drive (Raid0). <br>  The video card is built into the Intel HD4000 processor. <br>  The aggregate component gives in synthetic tests and benchmarks such estimates: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/a5d/67b/8a0/a5d67b8a08771a1795fe2c263ff3472b.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/36d/6e3/0ce/36d6e30cef366e9dfc06c593cba5f163.png"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/d86/627/ca4/d86627ca434bc7cf34cd19ce4581248c.png"><br>  The operating system works very well, I had no complaints about the hardware. <br>  If desired, I could even play toys at medium-minimum settings.  Among the playables were StarCraft2, Fallout New Vegas, Assassin's Creed Relevations, Elder Scrolls 5: Scyrim.  That is all that I wanted - it goes in the version ‚ÄúI walk and play‚Äù. <br>  The only censure in my daily work was to the on-screen keyboard.  She is terribly uncomfortable, and still appears and disappears when not needed.  Fortunately, the bluetooth keyboard removed this question in most cases. <br><br>  The main advantage of the tablet (in addition to the adult OS), I think the battery.  It allows you to work for 5 hours at an average load, about 2.5 hours at full load, and over 8 hours in wi-fi and cinema mode! <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/093/16e/766/09316e766d68485aff2450abab27290c.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/f1d/403/500/f1d403500ef2d6f8c5f23fc7a59aed57.jpg"><br>  Summing up, I would like to highlight a rich bundle, the presence of all the necessary ports, an excellent battery, an excellent screen.  The disadvantages I would have considered the excess weight and thickness of the device, although with this filling it is quite forgivable. <br><br><h4>  Specifications </h4><br>  Windows 8 operating system <br>  Intel Core i5 3317U processor <br>  Processor frequency 1700 MHz <br>  Number of cores 2 <br>  4 GB DDR3 RAM <br>  128 GB internal memory <br>  No memory card support <br>  Screen 11.6 ", 1920x1080 <br>  Screen type TFT IPS, glossy <br>  Capacitive touch screen, multitouch <br>  Number of pixels per inch (PPI) 190 <br>  HD 4000 video processor <br>  Wireless connection <br>  Wi-Fi support, Wi-Fi 802.11n <br>  Bluetooth support, Bluetooth 4.0 <br>  The rear camera is, 5 million pixels. <br>  The front camera is, 2 million pixels. <br>  Built-in speakers, stereo sound <br>  Built-in microphone is <br>  Automatic screen orientation is <br>  Sensors accelerometer, gyroscope, compass, light sensor <br>  Dock is <br>  QWERTY keyboard is <br>  USB connection to computer is <br>  Connecting external devices via USB is, USB Type A <br>  Connect to a micro HDMI TV / monitor <br>  Audio / headphone output is, 3.5 mm <br>  Headset connection <br>  Dock connector <br>  Work time 9 h <br>  Battery capacity 4850 mAh <br>  Dimensions (LxWxD) 295x191x12 mm <br>  Additional Information <br>  Body material metal (aluminum) <br>  Tablet, case, HDMI / VGA adapter, keyboard, stand, network adapter <br><br>  Price in Russia - <a href="">40000 rubles</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/166811/">https://habr.com/ru/post/166811/</a></p>
