  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Pitfalls of choosing a data center</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  This morning, once again, I ran through the websites of companies offering server hosting services in data centers, which I was hooked there so much that I decided to ask for the opinion of the public. <br><br>  As everyone knows, Russia does not have a sufficiently authoritative organization that would deal with the certification of data centers.  On the market, their services are offered by a variety of data centers with reliability parameters that differ by several times.  Any barn is a Tier 3 data center. As before, all basements were called ‚ÄúB + offices‚Äù, and the slums at MKAD - ‚ÄúClass A office‚Äù. <br><br>  Yes, we have a classification of data centers by size, but I believe that the quality of the services provided and the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe data center are very distant concepts. <br>  With the same success, you can remove the hangar or the plant, make cosmetics inside, put a pair of household kondey, paint the walls with whitewash and place the stands there.  Cool get a data center, right ?!  And according to this principle, after all, most data centers have been made. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  A normal data center is one that is purposefully built and not crammed into some old shop in a decaying plant or warehouse ... the sores of the old building are not corrected by any kind of redecoration, and as a rule, it is unrealistic to shift the nearby communications.

      <b>Tariffs for accommodation.</b> <br>  Now there are such offers on the market: 50 000 rub.  per month for the rental of the cabinet, load 5-10 kW.  And in fact they go to and put the server, without even thinking that this is cheaper than the cost.  Given that data centers are not built by altruists, but by a very cruel capitalist.  At 10 kW of the rack only for the payment of electricity (kW * hours) takes 37,500 p.  per month (and this is at the current price, and it rises 1-2 times a year).  Data centers must be powered by the first category, tariffs are known to all. <br><br>  The initial investment on one rack, according to the most modest calculations, is about 30 thousand American tugriks to recapture them in 2-3 years and earn.  Given that I did not take into account the cost of the Internet, the salaries of engineers, taxes and other monthly expenses, which are also very large. <br>  For fifty dollars a month, you can be accommodated in a rented office space, partially converted into a server room or, even more beautifully, in a small toilet with a beautiful cabinet and a fire extinguisher.  Moreover, such data centers, as a rule, do not pay for electricity ... they agree for personal remuneration with individual managers of the lessor.  What happens when a manager changes with a landlord?  That's right, customers of such a data center consider their risks.  So it turns out, or save 10-20 thousand per month on the rack, but occasionally lose on a simple business, or initially plan to use these data centers.  But why then use unreliable data centers at all?  It‚Äôs better to just rent an office space and put a couple of racks in there, both cheaper and more reliable. <br>  By the way, everyone is talking about X kW per rack / server, and who thinks like? <br>  There are at least four typical divorces: calculation based on the sum of power ratings of power supplies;  by the rated power of one of the units;  according to the server's power rating;  at theoretical maximum peak power.  And there is only one honest way: measuring consumption in established mode. <br><br>  An interesting case was recently, the client turned to us with a request for 35 kW of power for the cabinet - the client used to pay for this power in another data center.  We, understanding that it was impossible to take such a quantity of heat in a regular cabinet, we began to study the situation.  It turned out that the client had a typical rack full: two IBM blade baskets (each with 4 power supply units of 2.9 kW each) with 16 blades with 2 SAS disks on the blade, plus several single-unit servers, plus a disk shelf for 16 disks (two blocks of 1.5 kW)  After an honest measurement, it turned out that the entire rack consumes a total of 5-6 kW (under load).  After understanding how he was bred before - the client moved completely to us. <br><br>  <b>Traffic.</b> <br>  What Russian does not like a freebie?  Guided by this, on sites near traffic in 98.8% of cases anlim is written at speeds from 100 Mb / s to gigabits for free.  Wow, how cool, and to the right are cute stars.  And if you click on them, it turns out that the traffic is not quite anlim, but with ratios and restrictions.  But how beautifully veiled!  What happens to a resource that exceeds the traffic of a certain secret rate?  That's right, or it is clamped by speed, or they offer to pay in addition ... well, and for the sake of prevention, every 4-5th client periodically gets a ‚Äúsurcharge‚Äù, because  traffic did not fit into the ratio.  And if you think about it, data centers rent channels and pay for each megabit.  It's like a home network buys one channel 100 Mb / s and sells to 2-3 thousand users at 10 Mb / s anlim ... even an interesting term was introduced: overbooking.  Normal data centers from ‚Äúcheap‚Äù are distinguished by a large supply of free band and overbooking coefficient. <br><br>  Another interesting point: there are data centers that provide the best connectivity (open peering policy, participate in all exchangers, rent a large number of channels with international and snooping operators), and there are those who agree with one operator and pour out all of it traffic ... no matter what the speed will be, the main thing is that through one operator (it is easier for him to sell the service, and the channel gives the data center cheaper). <br><br>  And the <b>behavior of the data center in emergency situations is</b> also very important. <br>  Whoever turned out to be in a blackhole under a DDoS attack of 10-100 Mbit / s will understand what I mean.  Almost all cheap data centers kill such a resource, and from those.  support comes: "wait for the attack to end, turn on".  It's a shame, and no one to complain. <br>  Fortunately, not everything is so terrible!  And yes, of course there are normal data centers.  There are only 5 of them in Moscow, make no mistake. <br>  How to choose?  It's very simple - to see, see the insides.  Read, compare, listen and be sure to see live, but rather bring the server and "potest" service. <br><br>  We made a virtual tour of our own data center, so that everyone could climb, look and, almost feel how everything is arranged.  The link can be found in the company's blog and website. <br>  This is not so much PR, we just want everyone to know that free cheese is only in a mousetrap and that the criteria for comparison is not just the ‚Äútariff for 1U per month‚Äù.  Yes, everyone has their own ‚Äú+‚Äù and ‚Äú-‚Äù, and we are not an exception, but it is necessary to compare not only tariffs, but also risks and hidden fees. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/95687/">https://habr.com/ru/post/95687/</a></p>
