The target amount of Bigpicture.ru is 200 thousand dollars, for this money investors will receive a 10 percent share in the profitable business. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c2c/0fe/703/c2c0fe70397042a4bd190816d5526494.jpg"><br><br>  And in less than a day, Bigpikcha <a href="">gathered more than $ 16,000</a> from 30 investors <a href="">on the platform</a> , which is 17% of the goal of the entire crowdfunding campaign. <a name="habracut"></a>

      The concept of the most visited autonomous blog of Russia Bigpicture.ru - "News in photos".  It turned out to be so popular that over the 5 years of its existence, the monthly audience of the project reached 2.5 million people (15 million views per month).  And the number of Bigpikchi subscribers in social networks is about 400 thousand. <br><br>  Since its inception, the project has been commercially successful, consistently earning on advertising.  More than 1,000 advertising campaigns were conducted for large customers and small businesses.  Partners include Gazprom, Rostelecom, Avtovaz, IKEA, BMW, Toyota, MasterCard, 1C, Sony, Kaspersky, MTS, Megafon and others.  In a word, there was always enough money, as well as those willing to purchase a successful entertainment platform, or to participate in it as an investor. <br><br>  According to the head of Bigpicture.ru Sergey Baryshnikov, the project needs investments to expand the field of activity through the acquisition and development of several new online entertainment projects.  Using the experience of the team and the successful strategy of promotion, they are planned to be brought to a profitable level.  Dividends to micro-investors the project's CEO promises with a frequency of once a quarter. <br><br>  <i>‚ÄúSergey, as far as I know, you were repeatedly asked to sell Bigpikchu or a stake in a project to large investors, but this did not deceive you.</i>  <i>And now suddenly - access to the platform of collective investment.</i>  <i>Is this a belief in crowdfunding potential, an experiment or something else?</i> <br><br><blockquote>  <b><i>‚ÄúWithout faith in the potential of crowdfunding here, of course, has not done.</i></b>  <b><i>We have a rather large core of a loyal audience, who for a long time in one form or another wanted to take part in the life of Bigpicchi.</i></b>  <b><i>With the help of VCStart, we gave this opportunity. ‚Äù</i></b> </blockquote><br><br>  <i>‚ÄúCan you somehow announce the future projects for which these investments are intended, or is it still a secret?‚Äù</i> <br><br><blockquote>  <b><i>‚ÄúOf course, I am not ready to voice the names, as negotiations are still underway on them.</i></b>  <b><i>I can only say that these are young content projects with a narrower specialization than Bigpikchi. "</i></b> <b><i><br></i></b> </blockquote><br><br>  <i>‚ÄúThank you, Sergey.</i>  <i>Good luck to your projects! ‚Äù</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/14c/cc7/090/14ccc709088d4bed92197bde4b171983.jpg"><br><br>  The collective investment platform VCStart.com, which opened in September 2014, is the first Russian crowdfunding platform, whose activity is crowdinvesting.  In contrast to the clearly expressed charitable component of crowdfunding, this kind of it provides for the investor to receive a share in the assets of a company seeking financing, depending on the amount of his investment. <br><br>  The only Russian investment structure VCStart.com works with micro-investors (any amount from $ 30 can be invested in the project), aggregating their aggregate share in relations with the investee.  Currently, VCStart hosts more than 120 IT projects at different stages of development - from profitable businesses to start-ups that are at the seed stage. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/364513/">https://habr.com/ru/post/364513/</a></p>
