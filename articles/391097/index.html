In the production of any construction work, one encounters problems when calculating volumes, whether it is expensive asphalt or a lot of construction waste from the construction site.  It is easy enough to estimate in mind several cubic meters of material - the whole calculation comes down to determining the number of cubes. <br><br>  But what to do when there are several thousand cubic meters of soil spread chaotically in front of you over a large area?  Not so long ago, such tasks scared many surveyors because of the complexity of the process, and the high possibility of making a mistake.  Now, thank God, the age of high technology, and the method of quick and accurate calculation has existed for many years. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/fc3/190/f92/fc3190f9266c455bbe849a074d4da84b.jpg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  In fact, it is very easy for a skilled worker to do this.  Surveyor, engaged in calculating the volume, performs work in several basic steps, which, in turn, allow you to many times faster to cope with the task and with greater accuracy than was possible before.

    <h3>  Stage 1 </h3><br>  At the first stage, it is important to perform a total station survey as accurately as possible and carefully process the data.  When researching, do not be lazy to rearrange the device for a better vision of the object.  The result will be fairly accurate after a few hours.  The error in the output of data on such works is within 5%.  This value is achieved by exact observance of the geometrical parameters of the measured body.  While the previous methods of calculation took several days and had a more significant error. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/726/cad/73d/726cad73d3b3dab12a329156ae2734a4.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h3>  Stage 2 </h3><br>  Data processing and volume calculation are the second stage.  Having experience working with geodetic instruments and programs designed to calculate volumes, you stop wondering about the capabilities of modern software.  Thanks to working with them, maximum accuracy is achieved, and human errors are practically excluded, since manual calculation is not used in this method. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/532/efd/34b/532efd34ba249895eb8db3dd26734048.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h3>  Stage 3 </h3><br>  At the third and final stage, we display the result in the form of a cartogram.  The cartogram is a visual demonstration of the distribution of earth masses in a given contour.  Also in the drawing are a few more indicators that help to understand the full picture.  Together with the volume you can find information about the working elevation, the local value of the layer and the elevation of the black earth in a given area.  All values ‚Äã‚Äãof these indicators are calculated automatically, which greatly speeds up the calculation process. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/51d/a82/2da/51da822da76059f6bd66b3356d24868e.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h3>  Factors Ensuring High Accuracy </h3><br>  One not less important factor is the processing of the information received.  When processing data, we use the Topomatic Robur software package, designed specifically to solve the problems faced by engineers in the design and construction of roads. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/18c/a61/421/18ca61421402c7e97b2ca0e1c87ec9d5.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The whole essence of the work in this program is to electronically define two surfaces (top and bottom), and calculate the volume enclosed between these two surfaces.  The main thing is to carefully set all the parameters for calculating the cartogram, and if everything is done correctly, the result will be displayed in the drawing.  If you need to further use and edit the cartogram, a lot of software packages are suitable.  Thus, the result can be displayed in the most convenient and simple form for each user. <br><br><h3>  The triumph of engineering </h3><br>  And now, the cartogram is ready.  It shows all the necessary data for the further work of accountants and designers.  All this work now takes very little time, not counting the time spent on a total station survey, and with urgent need, the result can be obtained on the spot. <br><br>  Thus, the fact that in the recent past it took the surveyors a few days of work, and could not accurately show the actual volume, moreover, it cost a lot of money, now it‚Äôs not more difficult than to break the foundation, respectively, and much cheaper.  Another advantage is the ability to calculate heaps of absolutely any geometric shapes and sizes. <br><br>  ps Thanks to the guys involved in <a href="http://goo.gl/2hvjjr">building surveying</a> , who provided this material. <br><br>  That's all about errors and inaccuracies found in the text is better to write in the LAN.
