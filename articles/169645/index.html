      <b>How did Basecamp for iPhone on RubyMotion</b> <br>  <a href="http://37signals.com/svn/posts/3432-why-i-loved-building-basecamp-for-iphone-in-rubymotion">English</a> |  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/168907/">About Basecamp</a> <br>  Knowing Basecamp for a long time, I want to think that the guys were not in a hurry just because they wanted to do everything as it should, and now - the drum roll - on February 8, the first official iOS Basecamp app got to the App Store. <br><br>  <b>Apple paid developers $ 8 billion</b> <br>  <a href="http://apps4all.ru/news/apple/apple-vyiplatila-razrabotchikam-8-milliardov.html">Rus</a> <br>  And 1 billion - already in January 2013. <br><br>  <b>IPhone appFigures app</b> <br>  <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/02/11/check-for-appfigures-brings-app-metrics-and-sales-data-to-the-iphone/">Angl</a> <br>  Application for developers who want to use appFigures statistics "on the go".  The service itself simply aggregates data from the Apple App Store, Google Play and Amazon, and presents them in an easy-to-understand form. <br><br>  <b>Google will pay Apple $ 1 billion in 2014 for the right to be the default search engine in iOS</b> <br>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/169157/">Rus</a> <br>  In 2014, Google will pay about $ 1 billion to Apple for ensuring that the search service of the ‚Äúgood corporation‚Äù remains the default search engine in iOS.  It is worth noting that in 2009, Google paid for the same right only 82 million dollars. <br><br>  <b>Applifier talks about the results of Everyplay and announces FaceCam</b> <br>  <a href="http://www.insidemobileapps.com/2013/02/14/applifier-reveals-everyplay-data-new-facecam-feature/">English</a> |  <a href="http://apps4all.ru/news/applications/applifier-everyplay-facecam.html">Rus</a> |  <a href="http://app2top.ru/ios/everyplay-%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B8-facecam-%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BC-19029.html">Rus</a> <br>  Everyplay allows users to record their gaming sessions in iOS and share them with friends, thus attracting new users and increasing the popularity of mobile games.  Developers can integrate the service into their applications using the free Everyplay SDK.  Applifier founder and director Jussi Laakkonen also says that Everplay is designed to transfer the best gaming moments between friends in digital form.  People can fumble their replays via Facebook, YouTube or Twitter. <br><br>  <b>Apple is too old for developers</b> <br>  <a href="http://tabtimes.com/feature/ittech-developers/2013/02/14/apple-becoming-too-old-school-developers-report-claims-google">English</a> |  <a href="http://apps4all.ru/news/applications/microsoft-i-google-samyie-relevantnyie.html">Rus</a> <br>  The most "relevant" company for developers right now ... Microsoft.  At least, this is evidenced by a new survey Evans Data, conducted among 450 developers.  90% of developers between the ages of 46 and 50 choose Microsoft as the most appropriate company for their development plans, but more surprisingly, 2/3 of the other respondents in all age groups say the same.  The second most popular developer is Google, which also outpaced 19 other companies in the race for the title of ‚ÄúThe Company that is likely to dominate the next three years‚Äù.  Google is most popular with young developers - 72% under the age of 25 choose the search giant as the most appropriate for their plans. <br><br>  <b>Kleverbeast quickly and simply creates applications</b> <br>  <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/02/14/kleverbeast-launches-into-public-beta-bringing-app-creation-to-the-masses-for-29month/">English</a> |  <a href="http://apps4all.ru/news/applications/kleverbeast.html">Rus</a> <br>  Created with the participation of the director and founder of Hatch Labs Dinesh Murjani, Kleverbeast today launches a public beta, making the process of creating applications available to the masses, allowing everyone (even those who do not know how to program) to create beautiful, content-rich applications in minutes.  The service uses simple drag-and-drop tools to help users arrange the elements of the application in the desired order. <br><br><h4>  Android </h4><br><br>  <b>In-app Billing Subscriptions from server side</b> <br>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/160911/">Rus</a> <br>  In-app Billing Subscriptions (subscriptions) allow you to automate the withdrawal of funds from the user's account for applications developed for Android.  This tool is a great assistant in the task of increasing the monetization of applications.  The article presents the steps to provide server support for the monetization tool for In-App Billing version 2. <br><br>  <b>Android Application Development with C #</b> <br>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/169467/">Rus</a> <br>  Monodroid and Monotouch are xamarin frameworks, which make it possible to develop an application in C # for Android and iOS, respectively.  Since this is a relatively new technology information on the Internet is not too much (except for off site and a large number of topics on stackoverflow.com), in Russian, I did not find any tutorials and information in general.  To eliminate this misunderstanding, I decided to write a small tutorial on how to start developing applications for mobile platforms using these frameworks.  In this article I will consider only Monodroid. <br><br>  <b>NVIDIA Nsight Tegra plugin allows developing native Android applications in Java in Visual Studio</b> <br>  <a href="http://www.androidpolice.com/2013/02/14/nvidia-introduces-nsight-tegra-an-android-development-environment-inside-visual-studio-and-its-free/">English</a> |  <a href="http://apps4all.ru/news/google/nvidia-nsight-tegra.html">Rus</a> <br>  Nsight Tegra is a new plugin for Visual Studio that allows you to develop native Android applications.  Unlike, for example, Dot42, which requires the use of C #, Nsight uses Java and you can write and debug applications on it directly in Visual Studio.  Nsight, in addition, provides an improved NEON and promises a 10% higher speed of the native code. <br><br>  <b>Samsung will leave with Android this year.</b> <br>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/169581/">Rus</a> <br>  For some, it may sound incredible, but Samsung really plans to abandon Google‚Äôs mobile OS.  The company plans to release the first smartphone based on the new operating system by the end of this year. <br><br>  <b>Android 4.2.2 is available for some devices.</b> <br>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/169613/">Rus</a> <br>  Google Inc. has outpaced its own plans for demonstrating the Android OS 4.2.2.  Earlier it was planned that this version of the Android operating system will be demonstrated at Mobile World Congress 2013. But the company decided to demonstrate the system earlier, and has already opened access to the update for some devices. <br><br><h4>  Windows </h4><br><br>  <b>Application Publishing in Windows Store and Major Errors</b> <br>  <a href="http://wp7rocks.com/posts/details/8243">Rus</a> <br>  So, your Windows 8 application is finally complete and ready to be sent to the Windows Store.  Your masterpiece can be downloaded by hundreds and thousands of Windows 8 users. You have verified that your code is clean, double-checked the unit tests and deployed it on various devices for a triple check.  You are ready to submit your application for approval.  But are you really ready? <br><br>  <b>How to make the application more attractive to consumers in the Windows Phone Store</b> <br>  <a href="http://blogs.windows.com/windows_phone/b/wpdev/archive/2013/02/13/make-your-app-more-attractive-to-customers-in-the-windows-phone-store.aspx">Angl</a> <br>  Again a discussion of the icon, name, description, and a couple of useful tips for describing your application in the store. <br><br>  <b>MonoGame 3.0 released</b> <br>  <a href="http://wp7rocks.com/posts/details/8253">Rus</a> <br>  Monogame is a free implementation of a framework for creating games from Microsoft - Microsoft XNA.  Supported platforms are GNU / Linux, Microsoft Windows, Mac OS X, Android and iOS. <br><br><h4>  Blackberry </h4><br><br>  <b>BlackBerry 10 video review</b> <br>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/169007/">Rus</a> <br>  In general, the system works quite smoothly, although in a couple of moments there was a slight inhibition.  This is probably due to the fact that the gadget in the frame is intended for developers and not the newest one.  But you can still make up some opinion on the OS, and also see BlackBerry‚Äôs successful solutions. <br><br><h4>  Conferences </h4><br><br>  <b>Sociality Rocks!</b>  <b>2013 San Francisco</b> <br>  <a href="http://www.socialityrocks.com/">Official site</a> <br>  Sociality Rocks! 2013 San Francisco is the first friendly conference for the Russian-speaking audience in Silicon Valley, entirely devoted to social and mobile games.  The venue - Hilton San Francisco Financial District as an ultra-modern space, popular among business travelers, will undoubtedly become an ideal gathering point for the international audience of mobile and mobile - to share industry experiences and news. <br><br><h4>  Applications </h4><br><br>  <b>The next big categories of apps for Facebook are movies, books and fitness.</b> <br>  <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/02/12/facebooks-next-big-app-categories-will-be-movies-books-and-fitness/">English</a> |  <a href="http://apps4all.ru/articles/applications/facebook-filmyi-knigi-i-fitnes.html">Rus</a> <br>  Since Facebook is working to build partnerships with large media companies, it sees tremendous growth opportunities for tools that will allow it to find and share movies, books and information for fitness.  At the D: Dive Into Media conference, Facebook Vice President Dan Rose said the company expects the new categories to be the growth driver for the next wave of applications in its ecosystem. <br><br>  <b>Apsalar found out the connection between engagement and monetization</b> <br>  <a href="http://www.insidemobileapps.com/2013/02/08/exclusive-apsalar-analyzes-the-correlation-between-mobile-game-engagement-and-monetization-by-genre/">English</a> |  <a href="http://apps4all.ru/articles/applications/engagement-and-monetization-by-genre.html">Rus</a> <br>  Apsalar, a mobile analytics company, has tried to figure out which genres are best for iOS free-to-play game developers to use to maximize profits.  Apsalar, which offers free SDKs with in-app purchases and analytics, found that some genres show a great connection between player involvement and monetization through in-app purchases. <br><br>  <b>Twitter: mobile users are younger, more interested and more easily addicted to advertising</b> <br>  <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/02/11/twitter-study-shows-its-mobile-first-users-are-younger-more-engaged-and-easier-to-market-to/">English</a> |  <a href="http://apps4all.ru/news/devices/twitter-mobilnyie-polzovateli.html">Rus</a> <br>  Twitter has published new research data about its ‚Äúmostly mobile users‚Äù or about those who are more likely to go on Twitter through mobile devices and the mobile network, rather than through a PC.  A study by Kantar Media Compete revealed that it is mostly mobile Twitter users who are more involved in several ways at once.  They are much younger, and, as a rule, more susceptible to branded content than their computer counterparts. <br><img src="http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/mobile-blog-post-2.jpg?w=640" alt="image"><br><br><h4>  Money </h4><br><br>  <b>SMS payments: how it works</b> <br>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/168987/">Rus</a> <br>  Now you will not surprise anyone with the possibility of paying for services by sending an SMS to a certain ‚Äúshort number‚Äù.  Even the farthest person from the Internet could hear on TV: ‚ÄúSend an SMS to the number XXXX to vote for YYYY‚Äù, and at the bottom of the screen see the inscription: ‚Äú* the cost of sending 30 rubles‚Äù.  The article tells how it works. <br><br>  <b>The decline in investment in mobile games</b> <br>  <a href="http://venturebeat.com/2013/02/08/the-deanbeat-after-zyngas-crash-game-investments-dive-44-percent-in-2012/">Eng</a> <br>  The relative failure of Zynga led to a rollback of investors from the mobile industry.  In 2012, investment fell by 40% compared with 2011. <br><br>  <b>Opera's report on mobile advertising in Q4 2012</b> <br>  <a href="http://www.opera.com/sma/2012/q4/">English</a> |  <a href="http://apps4all.ru/news/applications/opera-o-mobilnoy-reklame-q4-2012.html">Rus</a> <br>  Opera released a mobile advertising report in Q4 2012.  The company's advertising network averages 50 billion banners per month on 12,000 mobile sites and applications. In total, in 2012, Opera paid publishers more than $ 400 million.  And in the fourth quarter, publishers' shows and revenues doubled (making the quarter a record), Android continued to grow ‚Äî headed by Samsung Galaxy S III. <br><img src="http://www.opera.com/bitmaps/company/sma/2012/q4/ios-monetization_small.png" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>Mobilewalla received investment in analytics development</b> <br>  <a href="http://apps4all.ru/news/applications/mobilewalla-poluchila-investitsii.html">Rus</a> <br>  Mobilewalla was one of the first players on the application search field, but about a year ago the company announced that it was starting an analytical business.  At that time, the description of the service looked pretty trite.  For example, the MediaPost article describes a service as a combination of publicly available data from ratings and private sales data, as well as mentions on social networks, like Twitter and Facebook.  As stated in the article, a startup has accumulated about 50 terabytes of data from the App Store and Google Play, and every week another terabyte accumulates. <br><br><h4>  Devices </h4><br><br>  <b>Nokia and the Elop effect: continued</b> <br>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/168097/">Part 1</a> -&gt; <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/168173/">Part 2</a> -&gt; <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/168785/">Part 3</a> <br>  As far as can be seen from the official reports of Nokia, neither in the position of Nokia at the beginning of 2011, nor in the dynamics of the company, were there any prerequisites for Burning Platform.  The company did not need a sharp change of course - ‚Äúanti-crisis measures‚Äù taken by Elop were not in the interests of Nokia.  Eop's assurances to the contrary is a deliberate lie. <br><br>  <b>The buzz around Nokia‚Äôs early collapse is unjustified, or what are analysts keeping back?</b> <br>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/168983/">Rus</a> <br>  Let's just wait a couple of weeks and we will not make premature forecasts, and even more so to express a trend opinion today that Microsoft is knocking Nokia's price down to buy it cheaper then.  After all, judging by the state of things, Microsoft is doing something wrong.  The price of the company is growing steadily.  The painful change of the platform has passed and remained in history. <br><br>  <b>Screen sizes</b> <br>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/169141/">Rus</a> <br>  Tablets and smartphones are equipped with screens with different aspect ratios and different pixel densities, but these parameters are rarely indicated in the technical specifications.  Let's try to deal with all the tricks associated with these parameters. <br><img src="http://nadezhin.ru/lj/pic13a/screen01.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>Tablet as a second screen under linux</b> <br>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/169003/">Rus</a> <br>  I decided to try to use the tablet as an additional screen for my laptop with Linux for expanding the workspace, touch input and remote control.  Found 2 ways to do this.  What and share. <br><br>  <b>Delivery of Nexus 4 from the USA in 4 days</b> <br>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/169079/">Rus</a> <br>  An unfamiliar voice says: ‚ÄúYour parcel arrived.  In an hour we'll bring you home. ‚ÄùStop!  After all, she left only on Friday from your warehouse in the US?  Do not confuse anything?  The courier convinced me that the package was mine, and I agreed to the delivery.  An hour later, arriving home, I met a courier and received a parcel from him with a brand new Nexus 4. To be honest, it was VERY unusual!  Just recently I bought it, but here it is already with me. <br><br>  <b>Every 10 years, a cataclysm kills most of the mobile brands - and we are on the threshold of the next</b> <br>  <a href="http://bgr.com/2013/02/13/smartphone-market-analysis-cycle-crash-325735/">English</a> |  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/apps4all/blog/169379/">Rus</a> |  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/apps4all/blog/169379/">Best comment</a> <br>  Around 1994, most mobile brands with claims of global dominance disappeared or returned to their home markets.  The same thing happened in 2003. And now we are close to the next Death of the Gods, a period of destruction and chaos that only a few manufacturers will survive. <br><br>  <b>Ubuntu Phone will be available next week.</b> <br>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/169603/">Rus</a> <br>  The Ubuntu Phone installation image for the Galaxy Nexus and Nexus 4 will be available for download next week.  Canonical already announced this today.  Starting from February 21 two collected images will be available for download. <br><br><h4>  Other in mobile development </h4><br><br>  <b>jQuery Mobile 1.3</b> <br>  <a href="http://www.i-programmer.info/news/83-mobliephone/5452-jquery-mobile-13-for-responsive-web-design.html">Angl</a> <br>  RC 1.3.0 came out with a long-awaited toolbar widget, bi-directional sliders and new ‚Äúresponsive‚Äù markup. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/9f6/a67/9f8/9f6a679f8f94f646cf5754a04ee178e9.jpg"><br><br>  <b>Optimization of 2D applications for mobile devices in Unity3d</b> <br>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/169451/">Rus</a> <br>  The article is useful to any developers on Unity (not only project managers and technical specialists, but also just programmers, artists and designers), because it affects both optimization on Unity as a whole, and specifically optimization of 2d applications for mobile devices. <br><br>  <b>Little geniuses: we test applications with children</b> <br>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/littlebeetle/blog/169375/">Rus</a> <br>  Children are always involved in testing applications from Little Beetle - end users of our products.  Before the release of the updated version of the ‚ÄúLittle Genius 2.0‚Äù application, we once again invited young testers to our office. <br><br>  <b>TapCanvas goes out of beta</b> <br>  <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/02/13/mobile-app-builder-tapcanvas-exits-beta-partners-with-eventbrite-to-make-event-app-creation-easier/">English</a> |  <a href="http://apps4all.ru/news/applications/tapcanvas.html">Rus</a> <br>  TapCanvas, a start-up that helps people who cann‚Äôt program mobile apps, has gone out of beta and announced the start of a collaboration with Eventbrite to create event management apps.  Despite the fact that there are many other application designers (at least a few dozen), TapCanvas differs from them due to the focus on creating one-time, context-sensitive applications using web technologies like HTML5, rather than applications for major application stores of leading platforms. <br><br>  <b>GoDaddy bought M.dot to create mobile websites</b> <br>  <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/02/11/godaddy-buys-m-dot-a-mobile-website-building-app-to-push-its-mobile-and-freemium-businesses/">English</a> |  <a href="http://apps4all.ru/news/applications/godaddy-m-dot.html">Rus</a> <br>  GoDaddy, a giant in web hosting and domain registration, took another step towards the mobile market, enabling small businesses to organize all their online activities through a single, simple store that also works in a freemium model.  Today, it announced the acquisition of M.dot, a startup developing an iOS application that allows users to create mobile websites.  Financial terms of the transaction were not disclosed, but most likely amounted to $ 15 million. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/169645/">https://habr.com/ru/post/169645/</a></p>
