They called it the Fluent design system - it develops the current visual language in order to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017/05/11/microsofts-design-rules-push-windows-beyond-mere-rectangles/">integrate not only screen interfaces, but also augmented / virtual reality</a> .  If Material Design showed at one time a way to unify everything that has a display, then this is the next step in the development of visual languages. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vcBGj4R7Fo0" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  So far this is just a one-page with a story about ideology, plus a <a href="https://developer.microsoft.com/windows/apps/design">few new pages in the UWP (Universal Windows Platform) guidelines</a> .  But this will be the development of UWP (there are already <a href="https://medium.com/microsoft-design/rapid-prototyping-uwp-apps-88ad238f7ef6">templates and toolkits for many design tools</a> - Sketch, Photoshop, Illustrator, XD and Framer).  I wonder how it will affect the <a href="https://dev.office.com/fabric">design of the Office Fabric</a> . <br><br>  At the beginning of the year, <a href="https://mspoweruser.com/project-neon-windows-10-first-look/">screenshots of its earlier version, codenamed Project Neon</a> , flowed <a href="https://mspoweruser.com/project-neon-windows-10-first-look/">away</a> .  They showed the return of the translucency effect from Windows Vista and the addition of typographic accents.  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DvcBGj4R7Fo0">A video demonstration</a> confirms this direction.  In addition, the already successful work with interface animation, which Microsoft rethought in 2010 and had a great influence on the market, has become even more cheerful.  And also the <a href="">principle of scale</a> , which is important for augmented and virtual reality. <br><br>  At one time, metro-design changed the interfaces with a more modern and organic for the digital environment approach and identified several key principles that picked up Google and Apple - focus on content instead of decor, the special role of animation.  True, mobile Windows could not fight with the leaders, and the desktop simplified the interface approaches in Windows 10. In the new generation, Microsoft added good ideas to Material Design, so the new generation of the visual language should become even more interesting.  Moreover, with the new update cycle every six months, this will not remain an empty projector, as has often happened before. <br><br>  <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/groups/13529340">Official group on LinkedIn</a> . <br><br>  <strong>Android O</strong> <br>  At the Google I / O conference, Android updates were presented.  The design team of the company <a href="https://medium.com/google-design/i-o-2017-our-definitive-guide-to-design-c6c25cb3e99f">noted the most interesting presentations</a> . <br><br> <a href="https://medium.com/google-design/i-o-2017-our-definitive-guide-to-design-c6c25cb3e99f"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b14/006/a69/b14006a6962619aed360cb25980dce1b.jpg" alt="Google I / O 2017" width="780" height="261"></a> <br><br>  The main technical changes, the interface concerns everything that has already been announced before (finally, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017/05/17/google-android-o-notification-dots/">indicators of updates</a> appeared <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017/05/17/google-android-o-notification-dots/">on the application icons</a> , <a href="https://medium.com/google-design/redesigning-android-emoji-cb22e3b51cc6">new emoji</a> (not better than old ones), <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017/05/17/android-s-integrated-ai-knows-what-you-need-to-copy-and-paste/">contextual tips for working with the clipboard</a> , improving the notification area).  Now a simplified version of Tensor Flow is built into the platform, solving machine learning tasks, the next acceleration of work and reducing the load on the battery, a new <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017/05/18/google-seurat-vr/">powerful engine for 3D graphics</a> .  The best part is that many standard animations have been added to the standard libraries.  You can put the beta version of Android O. <br><br>  There were <a href="https://material.io/components/">libraries of Material Design components</a> and online tutorials on their use: <a href="https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/mdc-android/">Android</a> , <a href="https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/mdc-ios/">iOS</a> and the <a href="https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/mdc-web/">web</a> .  In the office, Google gathered a <a href="https://medium.com/google-design/sprinting-towards-innovation-fad37f833e80">large work session with sensible local designers</a> who offered <a href="https://dimensionssprint.withgoogle.com/">many application concepts</a> .  By the way, the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017/05/17/android-powers-2-billion-devices-around-the-world/">platform is already used on 2 billion devices</a> . <br><br>  Interestingly, Google is experimenting in the background with a non-Linux version of Android.  It is called Fuchsia and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2017/05/googles-fuchsia-smartphone-os-dumps-linux-has-a-wild-new-ui/">recently leaked its interface screens</a> .  There are no plans and deadlines for it, so the pictures are more likely to be in the know. <br><br>  <strong><a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/0B6KeL5PaO45GS2NwYXVGZU9mblU">Design system of Russia</a></strong> <strong><a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/0B6KeL5PaO45GS2NwYXVGZU9mblU"><br></a></strong>  The initiative group "Design of State Systems" showed the first parts of the design system, which should unify the websites of state organizations. <br><br>  <strong><a href="https://medium.com/dropbox-design/illustrating-a-more-human-brand-part-2-d2e9494cc8a3">Illustrating a more human brand, part 2</a></strong> <strong><a href="https://medium.com/dropbox-design/illustrating-a-more-human-brand-part-2-d2e9494cc8a3"><br></a></strong>  A continuation of the epic article by the Dropbox design team about the evolution of their style of illustrations.
