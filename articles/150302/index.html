He is really easy.  You will not need to memorize and enter unnecessary characters that you can meet in C-like languages. <br><br>  Readable syntax, easy to learn, high-level language, Object Oriented Programming Language <b>(OOP)</b> , powerful, interactive mode, a lot of libraries.  Many other advantages ... And all this in one language. <br>  To begin, dive into the possibilities and find out what Python can do? <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  Why do I need your Python? </h4><br>  Many novice programmers ask similar questions.  It's like buying a phone, tell me, why should I buy this phone, and not this one?

    <h5>  Software quality </h5><br>  For many, including me, the main advantages are readable syntax.  Not many languages ‚Äã‚Äãcan boast it.  Python code is easier to read, which means its repeated use and maintenance is much easier than using code in other scripting languages.  Python contains the most advanced mechanisms for reusing software code, which is <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259E%25D0%25B1%25D1%258A%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BA%25D1%2582%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BE-%25D0%25BE%25D1%2580%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD%25D1%2582%25D0%25B8%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B5_%25D0%25BF%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B3%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BC%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B8%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B5">OOP</a> . <br><br><h5>  Support Libraries </h5><br>  Python comes with a large number of collected and portable functionality, known as the standard library.  This library provides you with a wealth of features demanded in application programs, ranging from text search by pattern and ending with network functions.  Python allows extensions both from your own libraries and from libraries created by other developers. <br><br><h5>  Program portability </h5><br>  Most Python programs run unchanged on all major platforms.  Transferring software code from Linux to Windows consists of simply copying program files from one machine to another.  Python also provides you with a wealth of possibilities for creating portable <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2593%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0%25D1%2584%25D0%25B8%25D1%2587%25D0%25B5%25D1%2581%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B9_%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BD%25D1%2582%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580%25D1%2584%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B9%25D1%2581_%25D0%25BF%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BB%25D1%258C%25D0%25B7%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B0%25D1%2582%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BB%25D1%258F">graphical interfaces</a> . <br><br><h5>  Development speed </h5><br>  Compared to compiling or strongly typed languages ‚Äã‚Äãsuch as C, C ++ or Java, Python greatly increases developer productivity.  The amount of Python code is usually one-third, or even one-fifth of the equivalent C ++ or Java code, which means less keyboard input, less time spent on layouts and less time spent on maintenance.  In addition, Python programs are launched immediately, bypassing the lengthy compilation and linking steps required in some other programming languages, which further increases the programmer's productivity. <br><br><h4>  Where is Python used? </h4><br><ul><li>  Google uses Python in its search engine and pays for the creator of Python - <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A0%25D0%25BE%25D1%2581%25D1%2581%25D1%2583%25D0%25BC,_%25D0%2593%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B4%25D0%25BE_%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BD">Guido van Rossum</a> </li><li>  Companies like Intel, Cisco, Hewlett-Packard, Seagate, Qualcomm, and IBM use Python to test hardware. </li><li>  YouTube's video sharing service is largely implemented in Python. </li><li>  NSA uses Python to encrypt and analyze intelligence </li><li>  JPMorgan Chase, UBS, Getco and Citadel companies use Python to predict the financial market. </li><li>  The popular BitTorrent program for file sharing in peer-to-peer networks is written in Python </li><li>  Google‚Äôs popular App Engine web framework uses Python as an application programming language. </li><li>  NASA, Los Alamos, JPL and Fermilab use Python for scientific computing. </li></ul><br>  and other companies also use this language. <br><br>  Python is <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A1%25D0%25BA%25D1%2580%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BF%25D1%2582%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2%25D1%258B%25D0%25B9_%25D1%258F%25D0%25B7%25D1%258B%25D0%25BA">a scripting language</a> . <br><br><h4>  Literature </h4><br>  So we got to know the programming language Python.  We can say separately that the advantages of Python are that it has a lot of high-quality literature.  Not every language can boast of it.  For example, the JavaScript programming language cannot please users with a lot of literature, although the language is really quite good. <br><br>  Here are the sources that will help you get closer to Python, and maybe become the future of Guido van Rossum. <br>  <b>*</b> Some sources may be in English.  Do not be surprised, now a lot of great literature is written in English.  And for the programming itself, you must know at least a basic knowledge of English. <br><br>  I strongly recommend reading the book first thing - <a href="http://www.symbol.ru/date/816603.html">Mark Lutz.</a>  <a href="http://www.symbol.ru/date/816603.html">Learning Python, 4th edition</a> .  The book is translated into Russian, so you should not be afraid if you suddenly do not know English.  But it is the fourth edition. <br><br>  For those who know English, you can read the documentation <a href="http://docs.python.org/">on the official site of Python</a> .  There everything is quite clearly described. <br><br>  A good resource - <a href="http://younglinux.info/pdf">Basics of programming in Python.</a>  <a href="http://younglinux.info/pdf">Textbook.</a>  <a href="http://younglinux.info/pdf">Introductory course</a> <br>  One of my recently read books is <a href="http://www.python.ru/files/book-ods.pdf">the Python programming language</a> .  Everything is explained quite accessible in Russian. <br><br>  A good book, everything is also available in Russian - <a href="http://www.symbol.ru/date/784182.html">Python.</a>  <a href="http://www.symbol.ru/date/784182.html">Detailed reference, 4th edition</a> . <br><br>  And if you take more information on the video, then I can advise lessons from Google, led by Nick Parlante - a student from Stanford.  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DtKTZoB2Vjuk">Six video lectures on YouTube</a> .  But in a barrel of honey there is a drop of tar ... It leads in English with English subtitles.  But I hope that will stop this few. <br><br><h4>  What if I read books but don‚Äôt know how to apply knowledge? </h4><br>  Do not panic! <br>  I advise you to read the book by <a href="http://www.symbol.ru/date/841171.html">Mark Lutz.</a>  <a href="http://www.symbol.ru/date/841171.html">Programming in Python (4th edition)</a> .  Earlier it was ‚Äúlearning‚Äù, and here ‚ÄúProgramming‚Äù.  In "We study" - you receive knowledge of Python, in "Programming" - Mark teaches you how to use them in your future programs.  The book is very useful.  And I think one is enough for you. <br><br><h4>  I want to practice! </h4><br>  Easy. <br>  Above, I wrote about video lectures from Nick Parlante on YouTube, but they also have some <a href="http://code.google.com/intl/uk/edu/languages/google-python-class/exercises/basic.html">puzzles on the site</a> .  Interesting puzzles, I advise everyone.  In English. <br><br>  Recently, the <a href="http://www.codecademy.com/">Codecademy</a> programming school <a href="http://www.codecademy.com/">has</a> opened interactive Python courses.  After passing each mini-course, you will be allowed to do some kind of ‚Äúpractice‚Äù.  Lessons are taught in English, but everything is accessible and understandable.  Starts with <a href="http://www.codecademy.com/ru/courses/introduction-to-python-6WeG3/0%3Fcurriculum_id%3D4f89dab3d788890003000096">variables and data types</a> . <br><br>  And at the end - good reinforcing and beginner courses.  <a href="http://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/">Learn Python The Hard Way</a> . <br><br><h4>  Well that's all! </h4><br>  Well that's all.  Now you can learn this programming language.  I threw good resources and books, and then everything is in your hands.  Also, do not forget about the unofficial Russian Python site.  May it always be at your fingertips. <br>  <a href="http://python.ru/">Russian, unofficial Python site</a> <br>  <a href="http://python.su/">Russian site of Python programmers</a> - here you will always be helped on the forum.  And a lot of useful information on the main. <br><br>  Dare!  Good luck to all. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/150302/">https://habr.com/ru/post/150302/</a></p>
