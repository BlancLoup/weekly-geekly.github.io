The father of wearable computers is considered to be Steve Mann, a professor at the University of Toronto.  In the 1970s and 80s, he created several general-purpose wearable systems, including readers, biofeedback and multimedia.  In 1981, he developed a multimedia computer system for mounting on his back with a full-display for one eye.  Since then, Mann has a wearable computer every day. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  The pioneers of wearable computers include Stephen Roberts, who in the late 1980s created a computerized recumbent bike.  He inspired many enthusiastic inventors with his invention, who explored a whole range of technologies, culminating in the augmented reality system Ted Starner. <br>  In 1990, Xybernaut Corporation was formed - the first company that specialized in wearable computers.  She sold her products in niche markets, including the military. <br>  Until recently, wearable technology experienced serious technical difficulties, because  wearable computers were large and heavy, but with the advent of tiny new components, wearable computers have moved to a new level. <br><br>  An increasing number of technology giants are betting on wearable solutions.  Among the key players are such companies as Adidas AG (Germany), Fitbit, Inc. (USA), Fibretronic Ltd.  (UK), Google, Inc. (US), Jawbone, Inc. (US), Nike, Inc.  (USA), Olympus Corporation (USA), Recon Instruments, Inc. (Canada), Vuzix Corporation (USA) and Weartech sl (Spain). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/90b/1d0/8cc/90b1d08cc871b58d9dbea51410e51de3.jpg" align="left">  Interest in this area is so great that even completely unknown companies are included in the race for leadership.  It happened with a startup Pebble Technology, which was able to collect on the Kickstarter crowdfunding resource necessary for the production of smart watches 100 thousand dollars in two hours.  Pebble watches, protected from moisture and covered with durable glass that is not afraid of scratches, of course, work with an iPhone or Android smartphone.  Using a set of mobile applications, they can be turned into a speed and distance meter for athletes, a remote control for iPhone, located on the docking station in the audio system mode, or a device for receiving notifications about messages on social networks Facebook or Twitter.  He also announces incoming calls and allows you to read SMS.  The Pebble battery is designed for a week of battery life, and its charging is performed using a USB cable. <br><br>  Today, these are only the first prototypes of smart watches or augmented reality glasses, but the future of mobile gadgets is underwired with electronics, when it is enough to blink an eye to power a device. <br>  One of the ideas of electronics management was suggested by engineer Katya Vega from the Catholic University in Pio de Rio de Janeiro.  She was created conductive metal makeup, with which you can control the electronics with a flick of the eyelashes.  The first test of the microsystem was the elements installed on the eyelids.  When the upper and lower eyelids touch for a long time, about half a second, metal eyelashes close the circuit, the controller is triggered and the associated gadget is activated.  With this control, you can bind any technique, but so far the engineer has been experimenting with smartphones and small UAVs. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e0e/097/5fd/e0e0975fd4ce1fbb8b9db0e6a0f4e6a5.jpg"><br><br>  A real revolution of wearable technology is waiting for us in the field of medicine and health.  At the moment, 61% of all wearable devices are made up of various kinds of sports monitors. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a97/097/ccd/a97097ccd5c1e5c744f68506ddaaad07.jpg" align="left">  Companies have already begun to develop a variety of devices for measuring indicators of health, monitoring the work of the heart, the condition of patients with diabetes and other cases.  The American firm MC10 develops wearable sensors in the form of a conventional plaster and with the same plaster, flexibility, water resistance and durability. <br><br>  Under Armor sports equipment manufacturer E39 T-shirt, stuffed with a variety of electronics: accelerator, pulse and breathing meters, etc.  Under Armor hopes that one day such a T-shirt will be able to send all the information in real time to coaches who can track the athlete‚Äôs performance. <br><br>  Fashion has always been in step with the times and this is no exception, since International Fashion Machines has developed a smart fabric that understands electronic teams, and Stamp Shoes offers shoes that can help a bar visitor to get home. <br>  One of the inventions of ‚Äúsmart textiles‚Äù was recently announced by Motif.  The company is developing a raincoat with an integrated wireless charger for iPhone 4 and 4S, iPhone 5 and 5s, as well as Samsung Galaxy S III and Galaxy S4.  To charge the phone, users only need to put the gadget in the chest pocket in a raincoat and connect it to the charger.  To recharge the raincoat, you need to hang it next to the wireless mat, which comes immediately in the kit.  The cost of such a cloak is still unknown, but Raphael Balbi (the creator) reports that it will cost no more than usual. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/2cd/455/925/2cd455925a9ca2b0d8a79337eda432bc.jpg"><br><br>  Finally, some predictions and numbers from analysts ... <br>  Transparency Market Research predicts that the global market for wearable technology will grow from $ 750 million in 2012 to $ 5.8 billion by 2018. <br>  Markets and Markets predicts that the global undersea electronics market will cross the $ 8 billion bar in 2018. <br>  The figures are optimistic for companies that come to this market ... <br>  Wearable technology is becoming the most popular aspect of the new generation of consumer electronics and computing technology, making computing devices even easier, portable, unobtrusive and accessible. <br><br>  Article created on the basis of: <br>  1.
