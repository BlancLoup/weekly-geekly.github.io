What is Bitrix24?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  If you are puzzled by the search for CRM, then in numerous forums you will inevitably come across a mention of the <a href="https://www.bitrix24.ru/%3Futm_source%3Dhabr%26utm_medium%3Dreferral%26utm_campaign%3Dhabrblog1">Bitrix24</a> system and its discussion.  There are enough supporters and opponents: someone claims that this is not CRM at all (which is true), someone reduces the entire functionality of the system to a corporate portal, someone recalls about 12 free users.  As in any other company, the staff of Bitrix is ‚Äã‚Äãclosely following the reviews and discussions of our products in the network.  Sometimes we are surprised by individual comments and even nonsense associated with Bitrix24.  But there is a limit to everything.  About what Bitrix24 really is, how it can unite a company and help any business, we will consistently tell in our blog on Habr√©. <br><br> <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/bitrix/blog/274165/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/3ac/dd5/455/3acdd5455d3a40ea8bd9946099204431.png"></a> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  <font color="#0079db">Business is looking for automation</font> </h2><br>  It is difficult to find an employee, let alone a manager, completely satisfied with the organization of work in the company, interaction within the company and with clients.  If you look at the activities of the head, in many companies the same problems can be identified: <br><br><ul><li>  wasted or inefficiently distributed working time and, as a result, endless processing and processing complaints </li><li>  missed calls and customer meetings, unprocessed incoming leads, and, as a result, falling sales </li><li>  lost customer contacts and even bases, inability to sell </li><li>  termination of work with a pool of clients in case of dismissal of the lead manager or head of the sales department </li><li>  violation of intracorporate communications until the wars between the departments </li><li>  lost contracts, commercial offers not sent to the addressee, closing documents not issued </li><li>  mailings without customer needs and, as a result, mailing complaints </li><li>  normal late arrival and early departure without giving a reason </li><li>  lack of corporate ethics and culture, etc. </li></ul><br>  This is only a small part of the motives of managers who make decisions about automation for the purposes of debugging business processes and monitoring, followed by a new problem ‚Äî choosing a system.  This is a real challenge.  Among the hundreds of new-fangled programs and applications, universal solutions-leaders of the market, web-systems and desktop, it is easy to get confused even by a sophisticated top manager.

    <h2>  <font color="#0079db">Bitrix24: a game in your field.</font>  <font color="#0079db">What is the strength in, brother?</font> </h2><br>  <a href="https://www.bitrix24.ru/%3Futm_source%3Dhabr%26utm_medium%3Dreferral%26utm_campaign%3Dhabrblog1">Bitrix24</a> consists of several sections, each of which meets the needs of business management, such as working with clients, monitoring indicators, working with staff, marketing, planning, project management, and so on.  Let us dwell on each of the modules and see what the system actually can. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a02/b94/a96/a02b94a967ae448bb95fda993453f9ea.png"></div><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b48/bd1/c3a/b48bd1c3ac004d95b3569f4824a4f16e.png">  <font color="#0079db"><b>Tasks and projects.</b></font>  The task is one of the main entities in the Bitrix24 system.  When it is created, the name of the task is set, the director, co-performers (they will receive alerts about the task set), priority is set, dates for starting and ending the work on the task are planned.  For a full description there is a built-in text editor with the ability to format.  Inside the task, you can create a checklist with subtasks - this is very convenient for controlling the stages of the work or the employee's to-do list.  The task can be attributed to the project (group), which can be created according to the necessary criteria of the user (department, work, direction, office, etc.).  Additionally, you can select observers who will monitor the progress of work on the task, or delegate the task.  If the task is homogeneous for your company and repeats, then you can set it as a template, make it repeat every day (week, month, year).  All tasks are categorized according to the ‚Äúdo‚Äù, ‚Äúhelp‚Äù, ‚Äúassigned‚Äù, ‚Äúobserve‚Äù statuses and can be displayed both in tabular form and on the Gantt chart.  By the way, you can manage tasks directly on the chart bars: when you click the right mouse button, the task management menu opens, when you click the left button, the task card opens. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/aa1/7e8/2f8/aa17e82f8a3a4fd188e8b390ca06dcab.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b48/bd1/c3a/b48bd1c3ac004d95b3569f4824a4f16e.png">  <font color="#0079db"><b>Calendars are</b></font> directly related to the project work - all tasks are displayed on the calendar by days, weeks and months.  All tasks can be opened directly from the calendar interface.  The calendar is convenient for scheduling events, such as calls, meetings, meetings.  The calendar in Bitrix24 is integrated with Outlook and mobile devices - it is simply impossible to forget to do something.  The calendar field is easily controlled with the mouse: events can be dragged by day or by hour within the day.  This is very convenient: if you have not been answered to your call or you have moved the meeting, you can not even open the event card, but simply move it to a new time. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/0e8/eed/c86/0e8eedc869c54945885d4735f1819638.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/3cf/16b/2f0/3cf16b2f02604568b757dc745d69d492.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b48/bd1/c3a/b48bd1c3ac004d95b3569f4824a4f16e.png">  <font color="#0079db"><b>Business processes</b></font> in Bitrix24 are created using a visual designer, in the right pane of which the specified elements of the future ‚Äústructure‚Äù: blocks and functions.  Bitrix24 does not follow the BPMN 2.0 notation, but uses many of its provisions.  When creating a process, you need to select a category for which a business process is configured, if necessary, you can write user parameters and variables, and you can create commands using PHP code. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/3d3/89e/6c9/3d389e6c9afd4964bac1c31dffc0c38e.png"><br><br>  Inside each block of the business process, the user makes the necessary settings by filling in the fields of the action card.  To create most standard business processes, programming skills are not needed - you need an understanding of the algorithm and the process in the company as a chain of actions aimed at achieving results. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d88/b72/218/d88b722181674c6fba168d7ac9674aba.png"></div><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b48/bd1/c3a/b48bd1c3ac004d95b3569f4824a4f16e.png">  <font color="#0079db"><b>CRM</b></font> is a significant and, perhaps, the most discussed module Bitrix24.  CRM inside Bitrix24 meets all the requirements of Russian business to systems of this kind.  CRM stores contacts, cards of client companies and counterparties, and deals are taken into account.  Let us dwell on this tool in more detail. <br><br><ul><li>  When a client contacts, the manager takes the lead in CRM, then the system suggests creating contacts and a company based on the lead.  The card of the company, as in any such system, should be given maximum attention, because in the future the tabs of transactions, offers, business processes and so on.  will be filled with information in relation to the client. <br><br></li><li>  The transaction card indicates the transaction object, amount, probability of closing, status.  All transactions are grouped and displayed both in tabular form and as an informative dashboard that can be customized. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/cd4/cd4/134/cd4cd413467a49c4abd70ba1e1de4d7e.png"><br><br></li><li>  CRMs are also created, invoiced and saved.  The printed form of the account is easily sent to the client's email directly from the system interface. <br><br></li><li>  Inside the module, you can create commercial offers that will be sent to the client.  The fields of the proposal writing form help not to forget any detail, including the amount of the transaction, investment documents, KP status and much more.  Compiled proposal can be downloaded in PDF, printed or sent by e-mail. <br><br></li><li>  Modern companies pay considerable attention to information that is accumulated in CRM - data form the basis for making marketing and management decisions, serve as the basis for building a sales system, and are needed to calculate employee performance.  In CRM built a few ready-made reports on transactions, goods, leads, accounts and affairs.  Reports are formed in graphical and tabular views.  Inside the report, you can use the filter and set the parameters of interest.  There is in Bitrix24 and the most favorite report of salespeople and managers - the sales funnel, which displays the distribution of transactions by stages and indicating the amounts of transactions.  The funnel in Bitrix24 is of two types: conversion (the logic of its construction implies the inclusion of the following stages in the previous ones) and classical (all stages are separate).  Filters for sales funnel involve building by employees, dates, and other conditions.  Sales stages can be customized by creating their names in the directory. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a82/6a2/a91/a826a2a913a0490f8938349910611c98.png"><br><br></li><li>  All actions in CRM are logged - in case of a disputable situation, you can refer to the history and see the time and type of the event, the initiator and the associated entity.  For journal entries, you can also create filters and save them. <br><br></li><li>  CRM brings in goods that are then used in transactions, offers and accounts.  For a product, the price, unit, VAT rate, image, section and description are determined.  By the way, sections can be created, for example, as goods and services, if this implies the activities of the company. <br><br></li><li> CRM in Bitrix24 involves a lot of settings that are responsible for both customization and system security.  To set up additional card fields of any of the entities, even minimal programming knowledge is not required - any user can add the necessary custom fields of any format using a simple constructor.  In the settings, however, print forms with signature and seal templates are set, taxes necessary for the work with the system are introduced.  It is possible to create letter templates and integrate with external mail by setting rules for processing letters from a third-party mailbox - in fact, all correspondence is conducted within the system.  With the help of a convenient wizard, the integration with the online store is configured, there is integration with 1C "Enterprise".  Separation of access rights is distributed by standard roles, but you can create other levels of access.  A nice addition to the CRM settings is the store of paid and free widgets that can be connected to the system. </li></ul><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c2c/7a7/52c/c2c7a752c41e4becb2682ce4302216d7.png"></div><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b48/bd1/c3a/b48bd1c3ac004d95b3569f4824a4f16e.png">  <font color="#0079db"><b>Telephony.</b></font>  Modern business is quite tightly tied to telephony: these are cold calls, work with leads, and presentations, and technical support.  Managers need convenient communication integrated with the system of work with clients - this is the only way to achieve really high-quality service.  Telephony in Bitrix24 is implemented using WebRTC technology, which allows you to make / receive calls directly from the browser.  Calls to Bitrix24 can be made in different ways: voice and video calls from Business chat or desktop application within the company, IP telephony on landline and mobile phones, IP telephony via office PBX. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c49/e59/e79/c49e59e7911349d4835b8214c8a00514.jpg"><br><br>  Telephony in Bitrix24 is quite simple to set up - to connect softphones and / or devices, the minimum administration skills are sufficient.  Each employee is assigned his own number, it is possible to record all conversations (for further work with complaints, quality control, or training purposes).  Communication costs can be controlled in the balance section.  You can also get acquainted with the tariffs Bitrix24 calls in any direction.  In general, telephony in Bitrix24 deserves special attention - and we will definitely pay it to it in the next posts on Habr√©. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b48/bd1/c3a/b48bd1c3ac004d95b3569f4824a4f16e.png">  <font color="#0079db"><b>Post office.</b></font>  We have already talked a little about mail inside CRM, but there is something to add.  Bitrix 24 provides users with a free email server with unlimited space, built-in antivirus and antispam - those who have worked with free corporate email will appreciate the lack of hundreds of daily emails with offers from Chinese SEO and dating sites.  You can use the mailbox in the <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/bitrix24/" class="user_link">bitrix24</a> .ru domain, in your domain (it is created for free), as well as in the domain of any third-party mail service.  All emails will be collected in one place - no need to move between services.  Employees and letters to customers and counterparties are sent by mail to Bitrix24. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b48/bd1/c3a/b48bd1c3ac004d95b3569f4824a4f16e.png">  <font color="#0079db"><b>The social network</b></font> is exactly that part of Bitrix24 that is referred to by the discussion participants with the position ‚Äúthis is just a corporate portal‚Äù.  It must be said that such an opinion is not accidental - Bitriks24, indeed, managed to implement the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãcreating a full-fledged social network of the company (Intranet, corporate portal).  Moreover, when creating the Intranet, special attention was focused on the fact that the ‚Äúsociality‚Äù of Bitrix24 should not distract from the work process, but help build communication and relationships within it.  Briefly tell about the main features of Bitrix24 as a corporate portal. <br><ul><li>  Interactive Buzz - center of communication and information within the company. Working in it, you can immediately comment and mark the message with the "Like" button.  As in social networks, such marks affect the placement of content in the feed. <br><br></li><li>  The portal can be placed noticeable to all the ads and report in them relevant information.  Ads are collected in the upper right corner of the portal and do not disappear until the employee reads them. <br><br></li><li>  In Bitrix24, it is easy to create and schedule meetings and scheduling - all interested will receive an alert about the upcoming event. <br><br></li><li>  An extranet is as limited a working area as an Intranet, designed to work with external contractors, such as freelancers.  On the Extranet, you can set tasks, create chats, share documents and create a knowledge base (wiki).  Extranet groups can be created for partners, agents, clients and other external users. </li></ul><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/2d7/bfc/668/2d7bfc668c184f13a1e24de043c5bd93.png"><br><br>  Technology has been in business for a long time.  We are sure that most of you have certain tools covering part of the tasks that Bitrix performs.  However, the longer the company develops and the more it grows, the higher the requirements for the tools become.  As a result, a fragmented IT infrastructure is formed, consisting of corporate software of several vendors, which sometimes is not integrated either using the API or using other integration tools.  Automation turns out to be non-systemic and complex: users are forced to work in several different interfaces, remember logins and passwords, switch between windows and applications.  Bitriks24 builds a unified business automation system and saves time and effort of employees. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0079db">Chips Bitrix24</font> </h2><br>  In addition to the main modules, there are a few more useful and business-necessary chips that have been successfully implemented in Bitrix24.  They make work even more convenient, without forcing distractions on other tools. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b48/bd1/c3a/b48bd1c3ac004d95b3569f4824a4f16e.png">  <font color="#0079db"><b>Disk and documents.</b></font>  Depending on the selected tariff, the company allocates a fairly large disk space, which allows you to store documents and media files.  Additional disk integration with One Drive, Google Drive and Dropbox is possible.  The presence of the disk plays an important role in the organization of workflow and work in general: all the necessary files are always at hand.  Directly from the Bitrix24 interface, all tables, text files and presentations can be created and edited using Google Docs or Microsoft Office Online.  By installing the Bitrix24 desktop application, you can create and edit documents using editors installed on your computer. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b48/bd1/c3a/b48bd1c3ac004d95b3569f4824a4f16e.png">  <font color="#0079db"><b>Accounting time.</b></font>  Many modern companies keep records of working time to increase the level of employee discipline.  As a rule, it is implemented as a system of electronic access to the premises and it is rare when it is possible to track the real working time of an employee, and not the time of entry and exit from the office.  In Bitrix24, working time, time off and breaks are recorded upon entry and exit from the system.  In this case, the employee may ask for a day off or tell the manager about the processing directly in the system interface.  Additionally, in Bitrix24, you can create a plan-reports on the work done during the period - and no more free essays in Excel, everything is implemented in a simple form that is accessible even to a novice user.  In addition, you can take into account the time spent on tasks. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b74/2d0/0c3/b742d00c3a0a44b09f414427e11efc2a.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b48/bd1/c3a/b48bd1c3ac004d95b3569f4824a4f16e.png">  <font color="#0079db"><b>Mobility.</b></font>  Bitriks24, all its components, including the disk and documents are available to the user from any mobile device where there is an Internet connection: you can work from the airport, business trips, and with a strong desire (or need) even from vacation.  Mobile devices inherit all system access rights - so there is no reason to worry about the security of commercial information. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/235/2c4/16e/2352c416e40042be93bc599f490d02bd.png" height="865"></div><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b48/bd1/c3a/b48bd1c3ac004d95b3569f4824a4f16e.png">  <font color="#0079db"><b>The company's pulse</b></font> is a metric-dashboard, reflecting aggregate information on the number of projects, tasks, transactions, etc.  during the period.  The most productive employees stand out separately - the spirit of competition motivates to work better: each employee can switch the slider and compare his activity index with the overall index for the company.  The head can assess the activity of using the Bitrix24 system itself, that is, actually collect feedback from the implementation and decide on the need for additional training. <br><br>  However, all these advantages are not basic.  The main feature of <b><a href="https://www.bitrix24.ru/%3Futm_source%3Dhabr%26utm_medium%3Dreferral%26utm_campaign%3Dhabrblog1">Bitrix24</a></b> is the complexity of the system.  If you look at the description of the opportunities in the post, it may seem to someone that a lot of superfluous, something that was never needed in the company.  This opinion is wrong.  Experience shows that as soon as users start working in the system, immediately there is a need to automate some everyday tasks.  Bitrix24 allows you to manage a company without leaving the system: work with clients, draw up and enter into contracts, communicate with colleagues, call, develop a corporate culture.  If after a while after the introduction you can see the list of installed programs, you will notice that you have stopped using many of them.  They are replaced by Bitrix24, in which you do not need to enter different passwords and run numerous applications.  Everything is at hand - you can simply work, moving from one task to another and watching the process.  This is called productivity growth. <br><br>  At the beginning of the post, we said that for Russian businessmen who are looking for CRM on the Web, it‚Äôs not quite clear what Bitrix24 is.  We answer.  <a href="https://www.bitrix24.ru/%3Futm_source%3Dhabr%26utm_medium%3Dreferral%26utm_campaign%3Dhabrblog1">Bitriks24</a> is a comprehensive system of company management, including work with clients, personnel, external contractors, internal social communications, telephony and forming a single working space for productive activities aimed at the development and achievement of the company's goals.  Our team has been developing Bitrix24 for a long time and for us this project is both development and business.  We act in two roles at once: the customer and the contractor, we strive to focus on the real needs of our customers.  We have something to tell you.  And we will tell. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/274165/">https://habr.com/ru/post/274165/</a></p>
