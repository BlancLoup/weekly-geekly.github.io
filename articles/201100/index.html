It's amazing.  A real understanding of the structure of a language means an understanding of the diversity of devices of all dialects.  This means the possibility and ease of building a universal intermediary language between languages.  And this means the possibility of automatic translation, and the possibility of purifying any dialect to the level of an ideal literary language. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  A language device is a thinking device, an understanding of the coding of data in the brain, because a person thinks in words-symbols.  Images of figurative thinking is a special type of data, of course, people also operate with images, but the transfer of this data is almost impossible.  We can say that the artist is the one who speaks the language of images, the language of which is not, that is, it is impossible to argue about what is impossible to describe in words.  To talk and argue about entities - you need to put each entity in a named container variable, that is, in speech, any mention of the entity occurs through the use of the name "container".  Entity names must be simple, preferably single-word, with a clear definition.  If a certain phenomenon cannot be packaged in a symbol-name, then this entity cannot be used in thinking, because each person will understand a different meaning.  A very important conclusion from this is that the work of art cannot be evaluated, it leads to the degradation of creativity.  Western education trains the left muscle of the brain, and the right quickly degrades, despite the fact that children up to school, almost all are very creative and perceive the world fully, in balance.  The advantage of this state of the brain - for example, the ability to relax and enjoy life without doping.

      People program (educate) people using language.  People are higher animals, but sometimes people are much inferior to other animals.  If the language is flawed, and if the sources of information lie, then people degrade, grow stupid with a step of one generation.  The rest of the animals do not use the language, but the program of their behavior and the effectiveness of their community are sustainable.  Look at the effectiveness of the program of behavior embedded in ants or bees - the effectiveness is higher, incomparable with Russian society. <br><br>  Natural intellects use language to preserve and transmit information, any data and knowledge.  Therefore, " <b>language is a means of intelligence for the preservation and transmission of information</b> " - this is the most accurate and simple definition of language.  Without language, intelligence is impossible, that is, for convenience, we will call the ‚Äúblack box‚Äù intelligence using language inside and outside itself.  / because we are interested in the first human-like intellect, capable of first solving logical problems for a person <br><br>  The inability of people to understand their thinking is the inability to classify the entities with which people operate and think.  Strictly speaking this is dementia.  And indeed, the world is obviously suffering from madness. <br>  It is necessary to realize the structure of a pure language, to understand the syntax, operators, expressions, and so on.  Ontologies-thesauri are also required for encoding the hierarchies of the classes of Objects, Actions, Relations, and so on.  The language structure looks like this: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a2f/7a3/3d2/a2f7a33d21878e694db5e680f8153a16.jpg" alt="image"><br>  It seems to be a simple task, but it is not performed by anyone. <br><br>  Rene Descartes: <br><blockquote>  ... If it is invented, I have no doubt that such a language will very soon get around the world, because there will be a mass of people who will willingly spend five to six days in order to get the opportunity to be understood by all.  The invention of such a language depends on the true philosophy, for otherwise it is impossible to count all the thoughts of people, arrange them in order, or at least just distinguish them, so that they appear clear and simple.  That is, in my opinion, the biggest secret in order to master the necessary science.  If someone could explain what those simple ideas are that are found in the thinking of people and which make up everything that people think, and if everything agreed, then I dare to hope that a universal language would appear immediately, very easy to master. , pronunciation and letters, and, most importantly, a language that would help the mind presenting all objects to it in such a distinct form that it would be almost impossible for him to make mistakes.  Now, on the contrary, almost all the words we own have such intricate meanings, to which, however, the mind of people has long been accustomed to, that for this reason it almost does not understand anything properly.  So, I argue that such a language is possible ... </blockquote><br><br>  Well said modern man: <br><blockquote>  ... It's about programming logic in general.  Human language is ‚Äúembedded‚Äù in our brain to a great extent, and its structures reflect the structures of thinking in the most precise and subtle way.  Scientists need to do not NMR scans of the brain, but to delve into the structure of human speech. <br>  Therefore, an ideal programming language should allow natural for a person linguistic analysis of a task into pieces and their presentation ... </blockquote><br><br>  An ideal programming language is an ordinary human language, part of it.  The invention of such a language will be a revolution in programming.  <b>I suggest that programmers discuss the possibility of building such a language here.</b>  / the author really believes that in this huge killed country there are gifted lomonosov wizards who are able to design good original languages, and who are not strong here to reason fruitfully, and not to pretend to be a princess on a pea that irritates any other people's ideas <br><br>  A machine that works with information in the form of a human language, uses inside and outside itself a human language - this is artificial intelligence.  This is the beginning of AI.  In the beginning, such a machine is the enhancement and automation of human thinking, in the end it is almost a human mind. <br>  AI cannot work with feelings and sensations, and everything else is just logic. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/201100/">https://habr.com/ru/post/201100/</a></p>
