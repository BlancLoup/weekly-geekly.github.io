  <section class="page js-page"><h1>We are 10 years old!</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  On August 27, 2010, the Materialize office in Ukraine turned 10 years old.  In this relatively short period of time, we managed to grow from a small representative office consisting of just a few employees, to the largest RnD office of the Materialize Group, which today has about 300 people.  During these 10 years we have been fortunate enough to work in various industries and have managed to contribute to the development of 3D printing and rapid prototyping technology (Rapid Prototyping). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/69/61/696171156254b7b1aabca25d916c5cff.jpg" alt="Materialize Ukraine"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  One of our biggest and brightest achievements is the fact that most modern 3D printers and RP machines use software written by the programmers of the Materialize Kiev office.  Such products as <a href="http://www.materialise.com/Magics">Magics</a> are leaders in the market of 3D printing and rapid prototyping.  Without our solutions, preparation, testing and working with 3D objects would be much more difficult, and in some cases even impossible. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/98/42/9842bb38630be2d4dec66a5badf95091.jpg" alt="Magics">

      We are also proud of our contribution to modern medicine.  Using our software, such as <a href="http://www.materialise.com/mimics">Mimics</a> and <a href="http://www.materialise.com/BiomedicalRnD/3-matic">3-matic</a> , it is now possible to create a plan of operation, simulate surgery and see the result virtually, which makes it possible to reduce the cost of surgical treatment (both time and material resources), but most importantly improve accuracy and reduce risks during surgery, and significantly reduce the rehabilitation period. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/aa/0e/aa0e0a2ec557d142ad7a7f0b23f2b953.jpg" alt="Mimics"><br><br>  Our solutions allow you to prepare in advance, if necessary, an implant that will be ideally suited to each specific patient.  With such technologies, doctors are able to save time on technical tasks, which allows you to devote more time and attention to the patient.  The healing process, as well as the patient‚Äôs further standard of living and comfort, increase while the cost of treatment decreases.  It is worth noting that it is important to prepare young specialists in universities, for which we can provide both individual unique cases and a course of study with examples of applying the latest 3D printing technologies directly in medicine and engineering schools (Mimics edition).  Western universities, such as <a href="http://www.materialise.com/materialise/view/en/389968-Cornell%2BUniversity%2Bswaps%2Bhorses.html">Cornell University</a> and others, have already worked with us on various projects, and we hope that in the near future, students of domestic universities will be able to try out the latest solutions of our company already in the learning process. <br><br>  Our developments in rapid prototyping technologies used in the industrial field also make it possible to abandon the work of design engineers, thereby reducing time and improving the quality of the finished product.  In recent years, we have actively participated in the elaboration of the ergonomics of the elements of car interior design, as well as checking the assembly of aggregates. <br><br>  Practically from the very beginning of the Kiev office, our team began to actively participate not only in the preparation of software, but also in other projects of the company.  We worked in various fields, starting with the preparation of prototype concept cars for the auto and motor industry, as well as working on projects of the advanced aerospace industry, and ending with working with leading world designers (as the most recent <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/materialise/blog/101148/">preparation of trophies of the Hungarian Formula 1 stage</a> ) and our design department <a href="http://mgxbymaterialise.com/">.MGX</a> . <br><br>  Almost a year ago, Materialize launched a new project - <a href="http://i.materialise.com/">i.materialise</a> , which makes 3D printing and rapid prototyping technologies available to designers, engineers, and all those people who know and love to work in 3D editors.  All technical support for this project was formed on the basis of our office. <br><br>  We hope that in the future we will see the same number of interesting projects.  Most recently, we launched our <a href="http://twitter.com/MaterialiseUA">Twitter</a> and <a href="http://vkontakte.ru/club18265913">Vkontakte</a> groups, and we will be happy to see you there. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/103529/">https://habr.com/ru/post/103529/</a></p>
