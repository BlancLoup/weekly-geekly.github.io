  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Office for Kolobok</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  I read a fairy tale about Kolobok to children and began to clarify for myself the managerial positions on the examples of this hero.  We turn immediately to the climax - to the Fox.  Since all the management fights Kolobok with the Hare, Wolf, Bear - are monotonous and are not of interest. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/112/f2b/3d9/112f2b3d939140184eab873285ec2c99.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  So, Kolobok sings a song about what he has left from everyone - what does he show with this?  His superiority and pride of victories, which leads him to defeat.  What does the fox do?  Holds a workshop stratagem.  Look at the cleanliness of the fox moves. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The first thing she does: adapts to the picture of the world Kolobok.  What is value to him?  Song.  She cares about the enemy and thinks about what is important and valuable to him.  What does she say?  <i>‚ÄúWhat a glorious song!</i>  <i>- said Fox.</i>  <i>‚ÄúBut I, Kolobok, have become old, I can hardly hear;</i>  <i>sit down on my little face and drink one more time louder. "</i>  <i>Kolobok jumped Fox on the face and sang the same song.</i>  <i>‚ÄúThank you, Gingerbread Man!</i>  <i>Nice song, I would have listened!</i>  <i>Sit on my tongue and drink it one last time. ‚Äù</i> She did not tell him that she wanted to eat it.  In my opinion, Lisa has implemented the ‚ÄúHiding a knife in a smile‚Äù stratagem.  Especially since the capture of the capture were the words: "I became old" - a plausible reason for the act is shown off.

      Before us is a beautiful and, most importantly, edible package fox act - to lure Kolobok closer.  Further, ‚Äúchanges give way to change,‚Äù Kolobok comes closer: <i>‚ÄúThank you, Kolobok!</i>  <i>Nice song, I would have listened!</i>  <i>Sit on my tongue and sing for the last time</i> . <i>"</i>  What does the fox do?  First: thanks to Kolobka for the song.  Fox is in no hurry, she knows that Kolobok is her - because the capture is fixed.  Second: praise - again acceptable packaging for the next act - requests to sing again. <br><br>  Third: The fox does not lie anywhere.  Is the song good?  Good, how good, because to her, Lisa, this song promises such a prize, she asks to sing a song for the last time - this is also true, but only Lisa knows that this will really be the last time in Kolobok‚Äôs life, and Kolobok thinks that the last time - this is for fox.  On the face is not the adequacy of the picture of the world Kolobok - what did he lean on?  The fact that it was empty - on someone else's picture of the world.  What was he nice about?  - boasts what he wanted?  Singing a song - his needs were met. <br><br>  Retreat: now, when I am praised, or I really want to be praised - you can remember what ended the fairy tale about Kolobok.  Why Kolobok reached such a picture of the world?  Because each victory gave him self-confidence and pride, he violated the main commandment of the manager: seek adversity in unhappiness, unhappiness in victory.  Those.  in victory, consider possible misfortunes from victory ‚Äî then, and only then can you see them, and, accordingly, avoid them. <br><br>  Conclusion: when you force someone to praise you, or you expect praise, do not be surprised that you yourself are pushing someone for the role of Fox, and yourself for the role of Kolobok.  An example of the thoughts of the manager whom the employee pushes for the role of Fox, expecting praise: ‚Äúif he (the employee) expects to be praised, it means he is arrogant, then he will ask for a salary increase, or waiting for a better offer, even from competitors.  So, he needs to be fired without spending extra money and energy on him to increase salaries, training, etc. ‚Äù <br><br>  Lisa withstood all the moves: each step of Kolobok was not worse than the previous one, but on the whole they led to defeat.  And Kolobok was very strong - he was such a fast runner - he left everybody!  But he was pulled, imperceptibly for him, on the ice. <br><br>  <b>The higher managerial skill of the fox was manifested in the fact that Kolobok did not even notice that he had lost.</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/95f/7f6/411/95f7f64110ad03250fbe48213096d8df.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  And now let's fantasize that if Kolobok would be smarter, how would he have behaved? <br><br>  What did he have to do?  Do not leave your grandparents?  but still had to leave.  Suppose gone, what's next?  It is edible, everyone wants to eat it - the terms of predators.  Living conditions are not the best, but you need to live.  First: disguise - pretend to be inedible Kolobok.  To say that: ‚ÄúI have rotten, moldy‚Äù is a war where moral deception, otherwise you will be eaten.  How did he achieve all his previous victories?  Distraction.  His song distracted his enemies.  They did not think that Kolobka would have enough ‚Äúdough in the head‚Äù to escape.  There is an underestimation of the enemy first counter Kolobok.  But, all these successes were not steps to the top, but a staircase to the fox's stomach.  All his successes in avoiding lung opponents were to train his endurance.  What for?  In order not to sing songs to the first comer. <br><br>  Suppose he stumbles upon a serious opponent - Fox.  What should have alerted him?  The fact that Lisa did not say that she wanted to eat him, but said: <i>‚ÄúHello, Kolobok!</i>  <i>How pretty you are</i> . <i>‚Äù</i>  (This, by the way, is still the first step at the beginning of losing Kolobok - capture of capture).  Kolobok ignored this danger signal because he was in love with himself and his song.  What Kolobok should have alerted?  "I am a delicious Gingerbread Man, everyone wants to eat me, Lisa does not say that she wants to eat me, it means that she has conceived something, she does not behave like everyone else, it means, most likely, she hides her intentions."  How to find out the intentions of Fox?  - task Kolobok number 1.  How can I do that?  Get close to the deer (because if you are a bad archer, come closer, you won't miss).  But you need to approach so that the enemy does not suspect that you want to find out.  You can not leave, you need to distract.  Gingerbread Man should find out: What is important for a fox?  To do this, you need to test the soil: ‚ÄúAnd you are a Fox, you really want to eat?‚Äù Kolobok could ask.  Fox answer: No, I do not want to, I want to listen to your song - this is a sign to run.  Let's put the Fox answered: yes, I want to eat.  The second answer would set Fox on viewing his picture of the world, which, as you know, does not tolerate any fuss, and Kolobok then at least would gain time and his chances of escaping would increase significantly. <br><br>  <i>I hope my reading Kolobka will help to better understand the importance of knowing the principles of management struggle, because management is not so much in business and in life, but even in the fairytale field - this is the usefulness of fairy tales not even in childhood.</i> <br><br>  UPD: I was inspired by seminars and books by Vladimir Tarasov for this topic, in particular his analysis of managerial fights and his analysis of the ‚ÄúMachiavelli Department‚Äù served as a model of analysis. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/162479/">https://habr.com/ru/post/162479/</a></p>
