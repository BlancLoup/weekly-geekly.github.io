The concept of "website promotion" has become synonymous with search engine spam.

      And my little company is moving further and further away from what is called ‚Äúwebsite promotion‚Äù.  Even when talking with potential customers, we try to say "the promotion of the company, products and services on the Internet."  And not otherwise. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  "Themes", "strategies", services </h4><br>  Many advice SEO gurus often begin to contradict common sense, for example, at the SEO-Conference in Kazan, Lyudkevich proposed to abandon the html standards - headings and semantic text, and the respected me Misha Raitsin - read the 2009 report (although, it must be admitted that when I asked him about it, he sadly said that we are hostages of the technology that is still working) ... <br><br>  And it turns out that search engines are developing, and in the approach to SEO nothing changes, only new services appear, ‚Äúthemes‚Äù and ‚Äústrategies‚Äù that solve well only very narrow tasks, and not global ones, such as website promotion. <br><br>  And in many ways, the main goals of these services are to help collect statistics for their creators in order to somehow promote their own customers, and under the pretext of ‚Äúadvanced‚Äù technologies it is easy to lure money from less educated ‚ÄúSEOs‚Äù, since  Services do not know how to think, and many newcomers do not want to. <br><br><h4>  PF </h4><br><img align="left" src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/a68/0f7/3f8/a680f73f85c949c602b256e85b87fa0e.jpg">  Yes, at the recent seminars and conferences the section ‚Äúuser factors‚Äù is necessarily present, but this is considered only from the point of view of influencing the issue and, again, services, replacing the true goal of these factors (to make the issue better) false (improve positions). <br><br>  And now everything goes under the concept of ‚Äúuser‚Äù - from ‚Äúrefusals‚Äù, ‚Äúvisit duration‚Äù to ‚Äúclickability in issuance‚Äù, the meaning of which is so subjective that it simply amazes our ‚ÄúGuram‚Äù. <br><br>  Guys, how can you say such nonsense with such intelligent faces? <br><br>  At the same time, all conference participants in one voice constantly say that they need to be closer to the client‚Äôs business and all that jazz. <br><br><h4>  "You can be close, but no closer than skin" </h4><br><img align="left" src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/2c1/3a8/7af/2c13a87af216c3a95c972e5ba303ac8b.jpg">  If you are closer to the client - this is communication.  And both parties must understand what each of them is doing.  The client is in the essence of the optimizer, the optimizer is in the specifics of the client's business. <br><br>  This means that more time will be spent on the project, and most of the time - to build the right image of the client‚Äôs company on the web. <br><br>  And such a scheme can not be put on stream.  This is a completely different approach to work and to the training of specialists.  Therefore, in order to become closer to customers, all companies will have to completely restructure their work and look for other specialists. <br><br>  Each business has its own specifics, and in addition to external links and SEO spoiled women, websites must first of all have useful (and not ‚Äúunique‚Äù) content that will tell you why I should prefer this company or product.  Apparently, this is why highly competitive products are better sold using Market, rather than ‚Äúpromotion‚Äù. <br><br><h4>  And after the top even the flood </h4><br><img align="left" src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/3a0/d2f/e93/3a0d2fe9371f2c2a71f98d158eb24895.jpg">  Interestingly, both sides diligently fail to notice that besides the results of the issue, search engine users have long been accustomed to using the services (depending on the wording of the request) of cards, the Market, Direct and Adwords, pictures-videos, links to social services and other joys. <br><br>  Well, how can you be the first in this variety of search results, most of the elements of which are artificially added? <br><br>  (Almost) no one studies analytics and does not conduct face-to-face meetings with clients in order to understand how their company is changing, and how the site should change accordingly.  On the contrary, everyone is trying to eliminate the most important element from work ‚Äî communication and mutual learning.  Although often not even a meeting, but just one call removes most of the questions. <br><br>  It seems that SEO companies modestly decided that analytics and training in evaluating the results of their work is a client's business.  Will go broke customer?  It does not matter - they are already outside the window. <br><br>  As a result, sites in the top of the issue, and client companies, excuse me - in the same place - on the periphery of the Internet. <br><br>  And this is also contrary to common sense.  It is better to lead a single client for a long time, to establish trust with him and gradually increase his investment in your work.  It is calmer and safer.  Right? <br><br><h4>  Who has increased TCI? </h4><br><img align="left" src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/f7d/481/256/f7d4812561f8f01a1a5f43d42d9013ac.jpg">  Everyone understands that technologies, link exchanges are no longer working, or are changing so rapidly that the use of specific, current ‚Äúchips‚Äù, ‚Äúthemes‚Äù and others is no longer an advantage. <br><br>  It is strange that clients in this area are only a catching-up link.  Although they, sometimes spending incredible budgets for a service, the effectiveness of which they evaluate only by the positions of their site and the list of a dozen of phrases, no one else can figure this out in as much detail as possible.  Indeed, for many, the Internet is the only source of contact with customers.  And the future of their business directly depends on it. <br><br>  Why is this all happening?  It seems that nothing will change as long as the demand for the service is too high, and the level of customer awareness is very low.  In addition, the financial threshold for entry into this area - the purchase of a domain and the book of Ashmanov - lead to disastrous results - the substitution of the true meaning of the word "promotion" by another - "spam of search results." <br><br><h4>  Muddy "mirror of the Runet" </h4><br><img align="left" src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/001/f18/655/001f186551f4de2d5eaa02b9932189f7.jpg">  What is the result?  Sites are either turned into footcloths, or contain confused articles of copywriters (I know, copywriters are not all like that) with banalities and zero meaning, for you can write a normal text only together with a specialist in the case in question.  And for this you need to get it somewhere and have its time.  Yes, and you need to be able to write not at the level of the presentation of high school class. <br><br>  As a result, an already small percentage of good and informative sites is reflected in the ‚ÄúRunet mirror‚Äù even less. <br><br>  On the example of the sites of my clients, I see that only common sense and an understanding of the real goals of the work give a truly effective result. <br><br>  Just one year from the beginning of work, a well-balanced content and audience site is obtained, which competitors are unlikely to be able to catch up with, since  This is the result of the work of a specialist‚Äôs thought in promoting the customer, and not the services that, as already mentioned, do not know how to think. <br><br>  And most importantly, this resource is an integral part of business and company, and not a thing-in-itself. <br><br>  Yes, probably, a big SEO business cannot be built on this.  But a worthy name, respect and experience for their own projects - it will even work out. <br><br>  Let us recall for whom, as a result, all this is being done - about the buyer.  How can he choose from all this monotony of gray content a worthy answer and a solution to his problem?  Who will he prefer and why? <br><br>  I hope that in order to understand these simple questions, a regular search engine user needs to wait a bit more.  Very little. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/135007/">https://habr.com/ru/post/135007/</a></p>
