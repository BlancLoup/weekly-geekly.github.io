  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Music 2.0 - what is it?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  I propose to introduce a new term.  ‚ÄúMusic 2.0‚Äù is music generated independently on the basis of a global automatic analysis of user preferences.  This is our future. <br><br>  If you think this is very easy.  For several years I have been professionally engaged in the creation of electronic music, and I have already become boring when I try to create a new, original music production, as a rule, it is thrown away by the masses because of the complexity of its perception.  And when I am half-randomly, being tired and without any inspiration poking with a mouse, it turns out to be something quite demanded. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Undoubtedly, in such music there is absolutely no soul, interesting energy, spark, individuality, ideological fullness.  And in this, if you think her power.  People (I mean very broad masses) get tired of originality.  They want to hear what they have heard a million times.  They want to experience the same feelings that they have experienced, but with slightly different spices.  The power of ‚ÄúMusic 2.0‚Äù is in the final disappearance of the soul.  When something can arise at the behest and voice of huge masses - it becomes empty.

      But that is not all.  ‚ÄúMusic 2.0‚Äù is an object that record giants cannot own copyright!  Yes!  After all, she never plays two times the same!  And its source code is distributed, of course, under the GPLv3 license. <br><br>  ‚ÄúMusic 2.0‚Äù picks up the smallest vibrations of the muscles of the face of the person absorbing it, adapts to the breath, to the state of health.  "Music 2.0" does not make sense to play live.  In addition, in her clips live people are not removed.  Only three-dimensional models are shot. <br><br>  Soon we will come to the conclusion that in modern styles of music the sound will always be original.  There will be completely original batches of unique instruments.  A voice will be generated into which micro-errors and style features will be intentionally inserted (also, of course, always different), so appreciated by many music lovers. <br><br>  Someone, perhaps a big entrepreneur, but rather a young student, will write a software framework for generating high-quality unique compositions according to all the laws of the chosen genre (of course, from a number of very simple and narrow: trance, house, etc.).  This system will be similar to modern Ruby on Rails and Django in terms of performance, and the electronic music market, which is already overcrowded, will become so large that it will enter a state of nirvana and self-destruct. <br><br>  We will come to this very soon.  At least the club music is exactly the cover.  We will again, as before, appreciate jazz, classical and ethnic music. <br><br>  Unlike the concept of "Web 2.0", the concept of "Music 2.0" is rather negative.  If the former arose as a result of constant evolution in the field of the web, then the latter arises as a result of the general degradation of the peoples and the masses in cultural terms. <br><br>  There are no obstacles.  And the voice will soon be able to generate at the highest level (there are already excellent developments, and work on this continues in full swing), and to describe music programmatically and generate parts and composition (without any problems at all), and to generate timbre - in general, room for programming. <br><br>  Do not believe?  Turn on the radio. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/6583/">https://habr.com/ru/post/6583/</a></p>
