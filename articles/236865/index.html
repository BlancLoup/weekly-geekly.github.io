Here are just a web development, I came across a very strange life circumstances.  Not to say that I was not interested - I was very interested in finding out how sites are created and how the Internet works. <br><br>  But, at the same time, I was always attracted to low-level programming.  During my studies, I really liked the C ++ programming language.  Only there was nowhere to use it, except for their entertainment.  Then I went down lower - I studied Assembler.  I understood how the processor works (albeit too superficially) and how the programs actually run. <br><br>  With all this set of knowledge and experience, I got into web development.  Everything at first seemed very, very good, it turned out to be much easier than I thought.  And over time, it became boring, it became too easy, uninteresting, there is no scope for optimizations and interesting solutions.  You generate web pages, write and connect js-scripts, make out pages with css.  I felt that I no longer develop as a programmer. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  At that time, questions began to torment me: 
      <br>

    <ol><li>  Why can't I create high performance web applications in a language like C ++ (not CGI)?  After all, I like this language more than anyone else.  I have never heard that there are sites written in C ++.  Why? </li><li>  Why web development captured scripting (interpreted) programming languages? </li></ol><br>  With interpreted languages, of course, everything is clear.  They are very convenient - no need to rebuild the entire project after making changes.  In this case, all changes are applied on the fly, without restarting (stopping) the web application. <br><br>  I was looking for the answer to the first question - how to write websites in C ++.  On the Internet, nothing sensible on this topic is not found (only through CGI).  And he was horrified: how is that?  I want to be free to choose a development tool, I want to use the language that I like.  And so far nobody has done anything?  Or did, but uses only at home? <br><br>  This made me start developing my own web server, where web applications (sites) would connect as libraries (* .so, * .dll). <br><br>  (During development, I saw the light and understood how to use the HTTP protocol correctly - I learned what RESTful is. I learned how to build the architecture of web applications correctly. I was surprised how many sites do not meet the requirements of RESTful, that is, in fact, they do not work correctly) . <br><br><h4>  The essence </h4><br>  During the year of working on my own web server (which I am writing in C ++ of the most <s>fashionable</s> new standards), I managed to implement all the basic necessary functions: <br><br><ul><li>  Sending files (using the X-Sendfile header setting); </li><li>  sending application-generated HTML pages; </li><li>  understanding and processing of partial GET requests; </li><li>  receiving data from forms (files and text) in various forms (application / x-www-form-urlencoded, multipart / form-data) and transferring them to the application as a finished product; </li><li>  support for keep-alive connections; </li><li>  Support Upgrade connections (WebSocket). </li></ul><br>  Operating system support: Linux, Windows <br><br><h5>  How my web server works </h5><br>  The web server at startup connects to itself the libraries specified in the configuration files.  Example: <br><br><pre><code class="nginx hljs"><span class="hljs-section"><span class="hljs-section">server</span></span> { <span class="hljs-attribute"><span class="hljs-attribute">listen</span></span> <span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">2280</span></span>; <span class="hljs-attribute"><span class="hljs-attribute">server_name</span></span> servertest www.servertest; <span class="hljs-attribute"><span class="hljs-attribute">server_module</span></span> /media/projects/sites/servertest/module/servertest_release.so; <span class="hljs-attribute"><span class="hljs-attribute">server_module_update</span></span> /media/projects/httpserverapp/httpserverapp/bin/Release/libhttpserverapp.so; <span class="hljs-attribute"><span class="hljs-attribute">root_dir</span></span> /media/projects/sites/servertest/www/; <span class="hljs-attribute"><span class="hljs-attribute">request_max_size</span></span> <span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">10485760</span></span>; }</code> </pre> <br>  Where, <br><ul><li>  listen - port for receiving requests to the application; </li><li>  server_name - web application (site) names; </li><li>  server_module - path to the library that implements the functionality of the web application; </li><li>  server_module_update - path to the library of the new version of the web application, used to update the web application without restarting the web server itself (almost on the fly); </li><li>  root_dir - root directory of site files (web applications); </li><li>  request_max_size is the maximum size of the request data (in bytes); if the data size in the request is larger, the request is ignored. </li></ul><br>  When connecting the library with the web application, the functions in it are searched for: <br><br><ul><li>  application_call - the function that is called to process each request; </li><li>  application_clear - the function is called to free memory allocated for headers that come from the web application to the web server; </li><li>  application_init - the function is executed when the library is successfully loaded, [optional]; </li><li>  application_final - executed when the web server is shut down, [optional]; </li></ul><br>  From the description it is clear that application_call is the main function of the web application, the entry point.  All headers (disassembled separately), request data (URI - resource identifier (query string), ‚Äúdisassembled parameters?? Var1 = sample &amp; var2 = 1000‚Äù), links to files (if transmitted), web application data are transferred to it (root directory).  Each request is processed and executed in a separate thread (thread). <br><br>  The peculiarity is that the client socket is also transmitted, with which you can (need) work directly. <br><br>  The main work on the development of a web server can be said to have been completed.  Already, the developer can create his own web applications in any programming language, the compilers of which allow building a project in the form of a library.  For example, C and C ++. <br><br>  Of course, you will need your own server (computer) to run such a web server (program) on it and enjoy the speed of web applications.  Just remember that using a database dramatically reduces the performance of any application.  But not so much to completely abandon the use of compiled languages. <br><br><h4>  Want to try? </h4><br>  The source code of the <a href="httpserver">web server</a> and the <a href="httpserverapp">sample application is attached</a> to it (used by IDE - Monodevelop). <br><br>  The web server is distributed under the AGPL license. <br><br><h4>  What's next? </h4><br>  The web server is operational, but there is still something to work on (to put the code of some functions in order, to write comments on the code). <br><br>  Further, I would like to take a closer look at and describe the structure of the web application, describe how to start development, for those who might be interested. <br><br>  Now I am writing a framework for convenient development of C ++ web applications for my web server (not yet available).  In fact, I am developing a website for one company.  An ordinary site is nothing remarkable, but with optimizations.  I use MariaDB DBMS. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/236865/">https://habr.com/ru/post/236865/</a></p>
