  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Effective crisis management</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The main focus of my work now is crisis management planning and implementation of efficiency improvement programs within the company where I work.  This article is devoted to the fight against the crisis within the framework of a single large advertising agency.  All facts and details relating to trade secrets are excluded from the text.  These methods can, in my opinion, be applied in any organization that has a similar management structure. <br><br>  This article is brief, introductory and, rather, draft, but even it, I believe, will be of interest to executives and owners of companies whose activities are aimed at providing services not related to long-term planning (i.e., the average contract implementation time is up to 6 months ), and the annual turnover does not exceed $ 100 million. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Let me remind you that a year ago I wrote about the main risks that a business faces, and about ways to overcome them - <a href="http://insie-ru.livejournal.com/181035.html">http://insie-ru.livejournal.com/181035.html</a> .  If many companies were more attentive to their finances and risks, the crisis that unfolded in the fall would have been less disastrous for them.  As a result, now discussing how not to get into a crisis is already meaningless, so let's talk about ways out of the crisis. <img height="1" src="http://ktochitaet.ru/pic.php?id=2719&amp;amp;type=1" width="1"><br><br><br>  <strong>Employee performance evaluation</strong>

      <u>By employee effectiveness, I mean a combination of two criteria:</u> <br>  1. The ratio of net profit per employee to the sum of the total costs of the relevant direction and the salary of the employee. <br>  2. The net profit from the employee's hour of work as the ratio of the total time spent by the employee at work to the net profit. <br><br>  <u>As the key reasons for the poor performance of employees in Russian companies, I see the following:</u> <br>  1. The lack of a clear and convenient system of planning, setting targets and reporting. <br>  2. Lack of uniform instructions for working with typical tasks. <br>  3. The lack of uniform instructions for work between employees in particular and areas in general. <br>  4. The lack of a clear vertical management and the distribution of powers and responsibilities. <br>  5. The lack of a single corporate spirit: clear goals and objectives of the company for the long term and for the near future. <br>  6. The absence of serious non-material and non-career motivation of employees (the majority work either because of a line in the resume, or for the sake of experience, or because they don‚Äôt take it anywhere else, or because of money, whereas ideally the collective should be the prevailing factor , corporate spirit, common interests and goals; by the way, it can be traced at least by the fact that all employees leave the workplace at a set time, if they wanted to ‚Äúbite the ground‚Äù for the company, they would have to be ‚Äúdriven out‚Äù from work). <br>  7. The absence of a flexible and multi-profile system of material and intangible bonuses. <br>  8. The lack of a clear and effective system of training new employees and advanced training (to replace part of the salary with practical case studies is almost an ideal way to reduce the company's salary fund costs and at the same time increase the professionalism and motivation of employees). <br><br><br>  <strong>Ways to improve employee performance</strong> <br><br>  Directions of work can be divided into several key blocks: <br><br>  <u>1. A unified strategy to improve the efficiency of the company</u> <br><br>  <u>2. Intracorporate interaction</u> <br><blockquote>  <u>a.</u>  <u>Adjustment of interaction between departments as a whole and employees directly</u> <u><br></u>  i.  The introduction of uniform instructions for working on different tasks and projects, the creation of a uniform template for the execution of tasks <br>  ii.  Development of a reference system for all typical situations that require prompt response from employees, from which employees could quickly receive all the information <br>  iii.  Setting up an automatic system of setting and tracking tasks (MS Project or another). <br>  iv.  Conducting joint trainings between departments in order to increase the efficiency of their work <br>  v.  Introducing a briefing system in departments and on specific projects. <br>  vi.  A clear distribution of responsibility for the constituent parts of each project with reference to the motivational package. <br><br>  <u>b.</u>  <u>Adjustment of company structure, company management structure</u> <br>  i.  Writing instructions for employees, to whom, how and for what questions they can contact, in what form, how soon and in what form the answer will be. <br>  ii.  Adjustment of the chains of setting tasks between multidirectional employees in the direction of increasing the responsibility of each employee for their work. <br>  iii.  Correction of the functions of department heads, interaction between managers, in order to eliminate points of possible conflicts <br><br>  <u>c.</u>  <u>Development and implementation of new formats for internal document management</u> <br>  i.  All sample documents should be uniform. <br>  ii.  Forms of requests and responses between employees. <br>  iii.  Forms of setting tasks. </blockquote>  <u>3.

Commercial offers <br>  ii.  Estimates <br>  iii.  Agreements of intent <br>  iv.  Contracts and applications <br>  v.  Acts, phased acts <br>  vi.  Conversation or meeting summary <br>  vii.

Subscribe to press releases <br>  iv.  Introducing new initiatives for the client, adapted to his realities, in the face of changes in his market <br>  v.  Binding loyal customers to managers, responsibility and motivation of managers </blockquote>  <u>4. Motivational and educational programs for employees</u> <br><blockquote>  <u>a.</u>  <u>Setting new criteria for assessing the quality of work, efficiency</u> <br>  i.  Employees, Senior Employees <br>  ii.  Department heads <br>  iii.  Divisions in general <br>  iv.  Certain areas by industry, region, location specifics <br>  v.  Companies in general <br>  vi.  Development forecasting <br><br>  <u>b.</u>  <u>Implementation of the updated system of material and non-material motivation based on new criteria from paragraph 4a, taking into account the need for the interest of employees of one department or direction in the development of other departments or directions</u> <br>  i.

Seminars and courses on the side <br>  iii.  Reading of books <br>  iv.

Game trainings <br>  ii.  Joint trips and trips <br>  iii.  Increased trust between employees </blockquote>  <u>5. Improving the reputation and improving the image of the company in the market and among potential customers.</u> <br><blockquote>  a.  Site <br>  b.  Modern corporate identity <br>  c.  Corporate standards for the appearance and communication of employees with customers <br>  d.  Adjustment of PR-activity under modern realities </blockquote>  <u>6. Increase the rate of profit from customers by expanding cooperation with them in all departments</u> <br><blockquote>  <u>a.</u>  <u>Development of a system whereby a proposal to expand the work is developed for each client, even if the client needs some specific type of work</u> <br><br>  <u>b.</u>  <u>Transferring part of customer service functions from one department to another</u> <br>  i.  Development of complex offers for large customers as a way to increase profits from them <br>  ii.  Consultation and briefing system for large clients by managers from different departments, brainstorming </blockquote> <u>7. Guarantees to the best employees that, provided they work efficiently, they will not be dismissed due to crisis, staff reduction, etc.</u>  (since they will work to increase the efficiency of the company, the company's loyalty to them is also important for them). <br><br>  The article is taken from the community <a href="http://community.livejournal.com/ru_economics/525896.html">ru_economics, the author Insai (insie_ru)</a> <br><br></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/51570/">https://habr.com/ru/post/51570/</a></p>
