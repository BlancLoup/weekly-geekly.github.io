Namely, the cost of Dell (ASUS, HP), with the same configuration, was 2-2.2 times lower than Apple products.  Installation of all varieties of Hacintosh, took a lot of time, nerves, and as a result, after the system was installed, even updated and ... hopelessly buggy, was demolished. <br>  Last year, an employee came to work with us and programmed PHP on a 15 "macbook pro. At that moment, I had a Dell with the same configuration. Having turned the Mac in my hands, I realized that there was nothing special in it, and I forgot. This year, the company decided to start a few startups in Python. As an avid PHP follower, I fought to the last, but gave up under facts. One of the best serpentine breeders in Ukraine was discovered and ruthlessly recruited. He also had a macbook. secretly glancing at Python. I tried to install it for myself under Win7, and everyone  just I realized that I want to nix-opodobnuyu system. At that time I was not quite a weak machine, 13.3 "Dell Vostro 1310, Intel C2D T8400 (2.1GHz), 4Gb DDR2 800MHz, HDD 250Gb, GF 8400M 128Mb.  On which, once again, tried to put Ubuntu 9.10.  This ended in the fact that Ubunta was never installed on her, she did not like the wi-fi card, there was no EVDO modem and other trifles.  With the help of a file and such a mother, all this was set up, tuned in and ... died ... because Photoshop was needed urgently, not to mention Office, not to mention MindManager.  Please, this is not a holivar, and products like OpenOffice, GIMP, XMind, amid licked from all sides and familiar, enrage me.  After 25 minutes, Windows 7 returned, and there was a secret desire to try "Mac OS X". <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h4>  Choice and surprise. </h4><br>  Despite everything, I knew that the toad would strangle me to pay $ 2000 for a laptop.  I was spinning around him in the stores, very quickly determined the necessary model - MacBook Pro MB991.  And I began to find any pretexts why the mac is bad ... I found them a very large number, and ... I proved and told their spouse ... I didn‚Äôt tell them, I just took it out with this laptop for a week.  March 7, I returned very tired, and went to bed during the day.  After 1.5 hours, my wife woke me up and gave me a small box ... to say that I had a shock - to say nothing.  To dig it out on Sunday, at 5 o'clock in the evening, in our village, and not even at the highest price before March 8th, is something.

    <h4>  Autopsy. </h4><br>  Apple's meticulousness to detail was noticeable from the box.  It is made to fit the size of the laptop + extra 5-6 cm on the sides, white gloss, pleasant to the touch, and not like regular cheap cardboard, etc.  For comparison, here are two boxes of identical size laptops. <br> <a href="http://xmages.net/view-image.htm"><img src="http://xmages.net/upload/cd0fbc1e.jpg"></a> <a href="http://xmages.net/view-image.htm"><img src="http://xmages.net/upload/293ea947.jpg"></a> <a href="http://xmages.net/view-image.htm"><img src="http://xmages.net/upload/69028750.jpg"></a> <br>  In general, the purchase and attention to detail pleases the eye immediately. <br><br><h4>  The first acquaintance with MacOS X. </h4><br>  What do you think will start to admire?  Yes, at the first hour I was thinking of throwing him to hell.  And despite the fact that it is metallic, pleasant to the touch, with an awesome sound (after a mono-column in Dell, this is especially pleasant for me), with simply unimaginable color rendering on a glass screen, with a very high-quality webcam ... All this faded on the background of the fact that I, with my experience with computer technology, was helpless before the new keyboard shortcut, the lack of these keys, the unusual work of the interface.  Where are my expanding windows, where are my Shift + Insert, Shift + Delete, and generally, * For WHERE IS MY INSERT and <s>Backspace</s> Delete? !!! <br>  It was all inside of me, outwardly I did not show signs of frustration, and was happy.  Subconsciously, I was already thinking of taking it back to the store, but decided to still give a "chance for Mac", now I understand that it was more Mac gave me a chance.  He began to invent all kinds of troubles for him: connect wifi - a couple of seconds, connect a printer via wifi (Epson Stylus T40W) - easily, evdo-modem ‚ÄúSierra Wireless Compass 597‚Äù - what to do?  No questions asked.  Eptta ... cool ... ok, go to the software.  Well, I will not run away already and immediately buy everything I need, well, we were not born in that country.  Rutreker, and go: msoffice2008, mindmanager 8 (about him below), photoshop cs4, textmate.  Half an hour - everything is set.  Next, install firefox, chrome, vlc, etc.  on trifles. <br><br>  After literally 1.5 hours, I will note that I mastered the compulsory (!) Work with the poppy part of the basic keyboard combinations, resigned to the lack of backspace, insert, home, end, just screamed inwardly delighted with the multitouch behavior (1 finger - mouse, 2 fingers - scrolling, 3 fingers - home / end farewell, 4 fingers - an awesome screen with all the running software)).  In general, I learned and got used to the main functions, but a lot of things remained unavailable to me, and even in principle I still think that I don‚Äôt know very much.  According to the assembly, the machine kills on the spot even simply by the fact that it does not have air ducts and holes at the bottom ... not at all ... lovely, i.e.  fewer holes - less dust.  Air ducts open at the back, and only when the monitor opens, the solution is simply super.  And the magnetic connector of the power supply?  Does the battery keep about 5.5 hours in a quiet mode of operation with Wi-Fi and office applications?  Vobschem such mega-hyper little things a lot, and they have all been discussed for a long time, I guess. <br><br><h5>  Two weeks have already passed, and I am absolutely delighted with the transition, and I know that I will hardly be back on windows or ubuntu on a working machine.  ) </h5><br><br>  But consider that all this was a preface.  Do you really think that I naively convince everyone that poppy is the most ideal thing that only is?  Let's go over the trifles I encountered during these two weeks ... <br><br><h4>  A barrel of tar in a spoonful of honey. </h4><br>  What idiot designed the location of the USB ports?  With the fact that there are only two of them, I have already come to terms.  Well, tell me why place these two single ports at a distance of 5 mm from each other, so that even two flash drives do not fit there side by side ... what prevents to spread them a centimeter at least?  And do not tell me about the usb-hub, this is insanity to carry with you too much.  To work in Photoshop, I need a mouse (by the way, only in it and in Excel the mouse is needed, the rest, if you want, believe it or not, it completely replaces the touchpad with 100%, and there is no such thing in any laptop)).  Mouse  Taak, pick up the mouse.  Wires - I hate, but on what does Magic Rat work?  Bluetooth ?!  As we have a delay ... wow, the delay is microsecond-annoying, too.  Such a mouse you can shove Jobs in the ass, why hasn‚Äôt he yet built his own radio transmitter for his own wireless mice, weakly?  Well, about the price of $ 75 for the Mini-DVI to DVI adapter, I will also keep silence, on the one hand, I agree with this, I am less divided. <br><br>  Let us return to the world of MacOS X in the vast and vast (not of Ukraine, but of the countries of the former ChiChiPi).  Naturally software is illegal, I repeat - for now.  Mack completely changes the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãsoftware, makes you rethink everything differently, you have to buy some software.  If MSOffice 2008 and Photoshop CS4 easily merge with the trackers, then I did not manage to find the broken MindManager 8, but for the sake of what I want to work on Mac - I am ready to purchase it, and I have already ordered (+170 EUR to the purchase price).  This is a specialized software that does not have <u>worthy</u> analogs, and many people probably will not need it.  Practically all the software can really be found broken in the network, and those who say that it is not, it‚Äôs just consumers of specialized software.  If you use it in your work, at least once in your life to thank the developers of it (I say this because the developer himself), by the way, very often when contacting support, you can get a discount, as for our countries (which is something it is both offensive and good at the same time). <br>  A little more experience.  The laptop is very quiet, or rather it is not audible at all, until you load it with something.  So on stage Adobe Flash Player.  Even banners force the processor to warm up from the usual 40-42 degrees to 55-60, and with larger loads, up to 73 degrees, thereby causing the fan to spin at a speed of 5-6000 revolutions, and creating a slight noise is tolerable, but unpleasant.  This is a stone in the Adobe garden. <br>  ITunes and the complete absence of sane analogs of an ordinary media player.  Oh Great and mighty, I did not give up your idiotic fancy iTunes, I don‚Äôt have to see the album covers for free, give me the functionality and size of winampa and I will be happy.  I don‚Äôt need synchronization, because I‚Äôm not even going to buy close iPods, iPhones and iLopata, because the first is not in the CDMA version, and the second is just a pi ** ec.  I use HTC Hero with Android ... by the way, here's where the damn native support for Android is?  Sync there, etc.  Again, paid ... Okay, it's time to get used to it. <br>  Given that neither QuickTime nor iTunes Nichrome can play videos in different formats, VLC Media Player was installed.  Recently I launched BluRayRIP video, 1920x1080 ... well, ** I, again, the fan spins.  As I was later explained, that despite the graphic chipset, everything goes through the <s>ass</s> processor, with wild loads, global warming, and, as a result, calming buzzing. <br>  Samsung SCX4600 printer and generally SAMBA.  It was installed cool, native drivers, everything is as it should be, it works - ideally, if directly, via USB.  And here we include it in the grid to the screw machine of our employee.  All ... come ... Who was there talking about the elementary setting, even blonde MacOS X?  No - I honestly asked the blonde to adjust.  But she did not succeed.  By the way, still does not work.  Everything that is read on this topic goes into such jungle nix-settings, which makes me sick, WHERE IS THE PROMISED SIMPLICITY OF SETTING?  The network between computers, especially with Windows, is easier and faster to maintain through Dropbox.  By the way, on Windows it is easier to set up a network, and the more so a printer. <br>  Very poor online knowledge base for Mac.  No matter how sad it was, there are no answers to many questions. <br>  Do not believe that nothing slows down on the Mac, and the software does not freeze ... This also accompanies MacOS.  Just 99.9% of situations do not lead to information loss, and the brakes depend exactly on the processor, and of course given that the software is more tuned for the Mac.  :) <br>  On a Mac, when you start up any Windows software, the processor starts to warm up, which results ... see above ... <br>  Just a mega-idiot program uninstall system.  In this case, all the cleaners do not normally work (makers - do not convince in the opposite, they leave enough trash, and you can search the folders in what-where, it‚Äôs easier to hammer your head). <br>  In principle, this is so far all that the worst is seen in the poppy ... But!  For the amount that is laid out, against the background of all the honey and the charms of the system, even the smallest troubles are just a barrel of tar, a spoonful of honey.  Since everything has to be licked out, in the end, the user pays a lot and, as it were, the premium sector. <br><br><h4>  The final part, the general conclusions (for today). </h4><br>  While working on the system, I understood such truths when switching to Mac: <br>  Hackintosh.  Do not even try, the money spent on the purchase of various suitable components, problems with iron, expenses and so on, nerves and in the end not enough bright tones due to the fucking monitor (yes! I have not yet come across any monitor that would give such the same image quality, Sony VAIO, by the way, also), will not give an idea about MacOS X, you will not learn how to work with it correctly without a mac-keyboard, and those who put it on laptops - also without a smart touchpad. <br>  You can not normally "switch" if it is not your Mac.  He must be possessed to understand.  Cult?  I don‚Äôt know ... it‚Äôs just such a feeling, no matter how much I tried to work with it, including for several days, but starting to work with it from ‚Äúinevitability‚Äù, the brain itself quickly switched to a different direction. <br>  MacBook is for work.  I repeat - MacBook FOR WORK.  Moreover, I will say that Mac contributes to a working mood, although it is likely that this is still ‚Äúeuphoria‚Äù from the new ‚Äútoy‚Äù.  If you are a player, Windows 7 is for you. If you need specialized software, do not use a Mac (only get disappointed).  Approach the choice consciously and deliberately.  If you are programming in Visual Studio - you don‚Äôt need a Mac, but if you are a writer or programmer in PHP, Python, Java, etc., then this is the perfect choice. <br>  Don't expect Mac to be the perfect system.  She has her own problems and jokes, and most likely you will not find many answers, by the way, tomorrow and we will experience the quality of mac support. <br>  MacBook Pro is worth its money at 100%, every penny will pay off with interest starting from just a good mood from the purchase and ending with the convenience and comfort of work (if the previous condition is naturally observed). <br><br>  Well, in general, this is all that I wanted to say.  There will be some questions, or something else - knock on the comments.  ) <br>  For assistance in correcting errors thanks: <a href="http://geektimes.ru/users/stampit/" class="user_link">StamPit</a> , <a href="http://www.twitter.com/howite">@howite</a> . <br><br>  <b>UPD:</b> Another drawback of the macbook about the 13.3 "version will be the lack of a microphone output ... This is some kind of horror, I want to use a headset, but I can't ... Especially since my headset is not the worst, especially for skype, for one ear - Senheizer ...
