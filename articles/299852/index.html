And today, April 1, we would like to remember that technical support engineers should have at least three important qualities: professionalism, communication skills and sense of humor.  Moreover, the last quality of the account should not be the last in importance. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/6d3/8c1/9da/6d38c19da7cb4cb381354950fdb8f4d7.jpg" alt="image">

      We with our team of engineers tried to remember what we heard interesting in the telephone receiver and read it over the past year.  We love our clients very much and sincerely try to help them, but sometimes it happens beyond our capabilities.  Still, sometimes a person‚Äôs stress from the fact that not everything works as it should, is very deep.  But we are trying to help everyone without exception. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h4>  <b>Who is there?</b> </h4><br><cut><br>  - Hello, I got? <br>  - Hello, IPtelefon, technical support. <br>  - I'm sorry, what?  It seems I did not hit. <br>  Calls again <br>  - Hello, and now I got? <br>  - Yes, now you hit <br>  - Where did I go? <br><br>  <b>It seems Siemens ...</b> <br><br>  - Hello, IPtelefon, technical support. <br>  - What are you fucking? <br>  - In terms of? <br>  - Nothing works for me. <br>  - What should work?  What are your services? <br>  - Everything should work for me!  I pay money and want a normal service! <br>  - Sorry, I can help you only if you call your customer number. <br>  - Go know where with your number!  I'll deal with you ... <br>  - So what do you want from me? <br>  - To my phone worked. <br>  ‚ÄúSo what's your phone number?‚Äù <br>  - It seems Siemens ... I do not remember exactly. <br><br>  Sometimes very competent and qualified people call the technical support service.  At least they are 100% sure of that.  It is much more difficult to help them, as standard solutions to their questions, as a rule, do not suit them. <br><br>  <b>Give it to me!</b> <br><br>  - Hello, IPtelefon, technical support <br>  - Hello, I do not have data transfer on port 202. <br>  - Have you tried to reconnect? <br>  - A strange decision, why re-connect if it does not work? <br>  - Let me reset your connection and change the password to the PBX. <br>  - Even more strange decision.  Give me access to your console, I'll do everything myself. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a6a/0f9/0d8/a6a0f90d84cd41f4adb13604b23f0698.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>Your server went down</b> <br><br>  - Hello, IPtelefon, technical support <br>  - Hello.  I congratulate you!  You have a server down! <br>  - Excuse me, what did you say? <br>  - Your server is down, connections are not passing.  Let's fix it, otherwise there is no internet. <br>  - Do you use our LTE Internet? <br>  - No, I have Wi-Fi in the office.  And already half an hour does not work.  The network does not see. <br>  - Is the router plugged in? <br>  ‚ÄúOf course it‚Äôs included ... uh ... you know, I'll call you back now." <br><br>  <b>Does not rise!</b> <br><br>  - Good evening!  I do not rise again, and so all day! <br>  - Sorry, that does not rise? <br>  - Like what?  Internet channel does not rise.  I have it this way and that, and I take it out and stick it again, but it does not rise.  What should I do? <br><br>  Sometimes, however, customers turn to technical support, initially indignant.  Do you think they were not served for a long time?  By no means!  The problem is that people are waiting for certain events for a long time, and we don‚Äôt even suspect that they languish in anticipation: <br><br>  <b>Where is my PBX?</b> <br><br>  - Hello, IPtelefon, technical support <br>  - I ordered a premium PBX, they said that it was more profitable, easier, and they didn‚Äôt even bring it! <br>  - Maybe virtual! <br>  - Virtual, premium - what's the difference? <br>  - Virtual - it is from the cloud. <br>  - Out of the cloud?  Are you kidding me? <br><br>  <b>How can?</b> <br><br>  - Hello, IPtelefon, technical support <br>  - How long can we connect the phone?  We left the application a month ago! <br>  - Name your number <br>  - 8-800  <br>  - This number is connected <br>  - Where is it connected?  Your installer did not even come to us! <br><br><br>  But that's not all.  Many find it not so easy to do things that are obvious to us.  But we have gained patience and we explain to our clients even such things that it‚Äôs indecent to talk about in the tech society. <br><br>  <b>Why doesn't the password work?</b> <br><br>  - Hello, IPtelefon, technical support <br>  - This is some kind of horror.  I can not connect, I enter the password again <br>  - What is your password? <br>  - Your paper. <br>  - And what is the login? <br>  - What is it? <br>  - Well, in the top line you entered? <br>  - I entered (login) (password). <br>  - Why did you write the password here too? <br>  - Where else?  At the bottom, some circles are obtained, it is generally impossible to enter numbers! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c43/baa/739/c43baa73922a4c518974b0d894cee7fa.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>Internet does not work</b> <br><br>  - Hello, IPtelefon, technical support <br>  - Hello.  And my internet stopped working.  He worked in the office, but he did not connect at home. <br>  - Why did you decide that he should work at home? <br>  - So he's mobile! <br><br>  Finally, our beloved customers often give the technical support staff a lot of positive and generally the kindest and warmest emotions.  Sometimes it even seems that it is because of such calls that people get a job in technical support. <br><br>  <b>A lot of pots</b> <br><br>  - Hello, IPtelefon, technical support <br>  - Hello!  745628 pots on the wire! <br>  - Repeat please. <br>  - Client 745628, last name Gorshkov <br><br>  <b>Thank God!</b> <br><br>  - Hello, IPtelefon, technical support <br>  - Thank God, you answered! <br>  - Sorry, have you been waiting for a long time? <br>  - No, you answered immediately! <br>  - Why is "Thank God?" <br>  - I was very afraid that you would not answer, and I really need help! <br><br>  In fact, besides jokes, do not be afraid!  We always answer and are very happy with every call, and the IP Phone technical support service is highly stress resistant and even possesses the basics of psychological assistance.  Every day we solve serious technical problems and therefore we appreciate such funny messages, because they decorate our work every day.  Do not believe?  <a href="https://www.iptelefon.su/">Become our client</a> and contact our tender, kind and caring technical support. </cut></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/299852/">https://habr.com/ru/post/299852/</a></p>
