A person, getting a job and creating his own business, in most cases does not know for sure what benefits he brings and whether he brings at all. <br>  For example, the manufacturer of spades, of course, makes them in order to dig, but often his shovel is not created and is not used most effectively, using as much as possible all the knowledge and resources known to man.  In my opinion, among other things, competition is to blame, which today forces one to make a choice: either you get A, but you don't get B, or you get B, but you don't get A. <br>  My main thought: this is that we would live much better if everyone did exactly what he wants, what he considers necessary, then what he sees the problem. ... This does not mean that everyone pulls into his just a person offers the world his ideas, ideas and solutions, learns and gains experience, promoting others, as well as corrects shortcomings in other people's projects, at least at the beginning of his journey. <br>  Today‚Äôs work is dull, does not allow to think critically, and whole nations are engaged in activities justified by today's realities, but obviously harming them: they steal, kill, go to the army, learn for the certificate, arrange demonstrations, stand in queues and traffic jams, look and create advertising, stand up at 7 am, rest on schedule ... <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  The essence </h4><br>  The goal of the project is for people to do what they want and then existence will turn into rest, and meaningless work into favorite work. <br>  Least of all, I would like to urge anyone to protest the current government and ultimatum demand for the introduction of changes of the state of interest towards self-organization.  The last thing I want is to organize another political movement or another party. <br>  My project is a kind of open research on whether a group of people in an arbitrary way, changing its composition (as an open-source community), successfully conduct joint business and solve pressing problems. <br>  And I am going to do this with the help of a discussion service and the organization of people and their ideas (forum / social network). <br><br><h4>  Definition </h4><br>  A self-organizing society is a society that organizes itself from within.  The direction of development in such a society is determined by its members based on their own interests.

      Samoorg is a portal that its users create, manage and own, and also receive the fruits of its activities.  Any person can become a member of the service; powers and privileges are distributed among the participants depending on the rating assigned by other participants for their activity directed to the benefit of the whole project and each of its participants. <br><br><h4>  Operating principle </h4><br>  Each participant offers an idea, method of implementation and resources, depending on what he sees fit himself and will evaluate the ideas and actions of other participants.  As a result, there should be a knowledge base and developments, as well as capital, which, in turn, should yield a commercial product at the output. <br>  But first, in order for the project not to stall at the very start, due to the complexity of the self-organization of users, the classical way (fixed by the development team) will create its own product, namely the portal of goods, services and organizations.  Since it seems to be the most promising at the rate of - commercial viability / ease of implementation.  This decision can still be challenged by the majority of participants, if everyone decides that it is better to do social.  Network or ballistic missiles, then so be it.  In my opinion, there is an obvious need to start with the finished product, which is created in the usual way, rather than trying to do something with self-organization with 0 just by self-organization, it will still be possible to discuss this topic, but for now. <br><br><h4>  Stages of implementation </h4><br>  The portal will be created on its own and at the expense of donates.  The donate of the participant will be stimulated by what will be visible to other participants, which will certainly lead to an increase in the rating of the participant and in the long run will benefit him if the project develops. <br><br>  The profit, if it happens, will be distributed among the participants, depending on their rating (ratings, which they set to each other).  And it is assumed that this will encourage participants to make even greater efforts to produce something, and this model will also attract more new participants who will simultaneously be consumers of the product offered by society, which will significantly save money on advertising and promotion. <br><br><br><h5>  Minimum tasks that need to be implemented in order for the portal to work and develop: </h5><br><ol><li>  forum for creating and discussing ideas. </li><li>  rating system for calculating utility. </li><li>  The choice of the starting niche of entrepreneurship, the most adequate at the moment is the portal of goods, services and organizations. </li><li>  the mechanism of distribution of profits between the participants, depending on the utility. </li></ol><br>  All tasks will be discussed, adjusted and partially implemented by users. <br><br><h4>  Conclusion </h4><br>  In the future, the goal of the project is complete self-organization and ownership of the project by its participants, without the possibility of interference from management and creators. <br><br>  Today I see no problems from a technical point of view.  In this article I did not go into technical details about them, you can talk later, while I tried to describe the mechanism of work in general.  My goal is to share the concept of self-organizing society, and get feedback for further dialogue. <br><br>  In the near future a conference is planned on the theme ‚ÄúSelf-organization of society - problems and methods of their solutions‚Äù.  It will still be announced, as well as the event report will be posted. <br><br><h5>  Contacts </h5><br>  If anyone wants to join, write to the mail wasilewaleksandr@yandex.ru <br>  And also discuss and follow the news in <a href="http://vk.com/samoorganizaciya">VKontakte</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/200332/">https://habr.com/ru/post/200332/</a></p>
