Either the team accepts the decision to run on separate physical servers due to the peculiarities of the technology, or it becomes necessary to increase the degree of data privacy. <br><br>  Of course, with the necessary funding, companies often buy new servers and network equipment.  Only, unfortunately, such lucky ones are now in the minority.  Most are projects with very modest budgets that do not contain articles for the purchase of new equipment.  And the majority in this situation raises the question of what to do ... <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  ... buy used equipment or use the rental service.  However, even the few who have the means to buy new servers, too, often think about buying or renting.  It‚Äôs like buying a property when the question arises - is it worth it to buy a house in the Moscow region for 40 million, which, if necessary, can hardly be quickly sold for the price for which it was purchased, or rent a house for the required period in a convenient place, which, if circumstances change, can be exchanged for another rented house that already meets new needs. <br><br>  In this article, we do not pretend that we present solutions that work in your particular case for one hundred percent.  We just want to help you not to step on those rakes that many have already attacked.  After all, everyone knows: it is better to learn from the mistakes of others than from your own.

    <h3>  How to spend more thinking that you save ... </h3><br>  Of course, it is not a secret to anyone that second-hand servers cost 2.5 and even 10 times cheaper if you buy them on the electronic market.  However, the same configuration will cost you two to three times more expensive if you contact the company that sells used servers. <br><br>  The market of the so-called refurbished equipment (in English it sounds beautiful, but we are talking about restored used equipment) is quite developed in the West, but still not as popular in Russia.  Perhaps because of our mentality: at the sight of the ‚Äúused‚Äù mark we usually imagine that this is an old technique that can be used, but something in it is definitely broken.  And in general, this corresponds to reality, especially when it comes to equipment purchased with hands.  Now on the market there are many companies that sell the recovered servers.  Before selling, they often eliminate defects and pack servers with proven components, which, of course, prolongs the life of the equipment, but does not guarantee 100 percent of the entire server as a whole. <br><br>  During the preparation of this article, we decided to concentrate attention directly on the issue of buying servers from our hands, since this method of acquiring equipment is the most risky.  Studying this question, we talked with sellers and buyers of used equipment and tried to combine all the best practices in this field in one material. <br><br><h3>  Where to buy a used server </h3><br>  You can go the easiest way.  When you enter the search query "used servers" Google or Yandex will give you a whole list of companies that are directly involved in the sale of restored used equipment, mostly servers.  The advantage of such companies is not only that you can come and, as they say, ‚Äúfeel‚Äù the goods you need.  The key word in this case is warranty.  After all, most companies provide a guarantee of one to five years (depending on the type of equipment).  In addition, you not only purchase reconditioned used servers, but also get technical support, you are provided with installation assistance, and in some cases even warranty repairs.  That is, you don‚Äôt have to do anything at all - just select the server you need and come with a direct request to the company.  In addition, most of these companies will not only offer ready-made configuration, but also collect the necessary server configuration.  However, the company's company is different - pay attention to the sellers with a long history, positive customer reviews, the presence of any premises where the product is displayed and where it can be tested, as well as the ability to verify the real existence of technical support. <br><br>  But what Russian people would not try to extract even greater benefits.  Therefore, many are moving to the next search option for used equipment - on various online flea markets, such as Avito and others like it.  Fans of shopping on the Internet can also use the equally popular eBay service.  However, do not expect that, since the equipment comes to you from abroad, then you get big guarantees.  In addition, the initially low, and therefore attractive price (for example, $ 300 for one server) can double when passing customs control at the border.  In addition, do not forget that in addition to everything you have to pay for shipping.  As a result, all these costs, taking into account the current exchange rate, will turn the initially low price into the diametrically opposite one. <br><br>  There is also such a thing as Lombard systems, which, among other things, are engaged in used equipment.  However, with pawnshops it is necessary to be on the lookout: the specialists working there for the most part can only connect the server to an outlet and also check its external integrity.  However, this fact in such companies and do not hide.  That is why they provide a guarantee for such a period, which is enough to check the equipment to the maximum.  Thanks to this, you can protect yourself for the future, and most importantly, if necessary, prove to the seller what exactly was defective in his product.  Most often, such offices and swearing with you will not be if you find a problem, because they themselves are well aware of their incompetence in this matter.  The revenue from sales in these companies is so high that they can afford to get your money back. <br><br><h3>  Where do used servers come from? </h3><br>  When buying used servers, especially from the hands, first of all you should ask yourself the question: ‚ÄúWhy does this company or this private person sell it?‚Äù If the seller is a company that has been registered for a long time and has several ads at once, then there‚Äôs no special concern must.  Most likely, they are dealers, who in the majority can offer more suitable servers for work.  Sometimes they even offer a two-week warranty so that the buyer can test the equipment.  However, it is regrettable to admit this, in the majority of announcements on the online flea markets stolen servers are put up for sale.  It is almost impossible to track whether a stolen server is being offered to you.  At the same time, with the purchase of such a server, the probability of getting stably working equipment increases several times.  It sounds strange, but in fact it is logical, because a server stolen from some data center or corporate server will obviously be in a more stable state than a server that is ‚Äúmerged‚Äù because of its malfunction.  We in no way call for the purchase of such servers, but no one is immune from such situations.  Unfortunately, the acquisition of stolen servers can lead to sad consequences.  Of course, this does not reach the level of ‚Äúshowdowns‚Äù in the style of the 90s, but, as one of the sellers told us, there were such cases. <br><br>  If the company sells servers based on Socket J (aka LGA 771), then there is definitely nothing to fear: this is a logical sale, since it is clear that the company is switching to new capacities.  Of course, you can use old servers for simpler tasks, but if you see an advertisement for the sale of such equipment, you can safely consider this option: most likely, the server is not stolen. <br><br>  However, if the server is relatively new, then you can already suspect that something was wrong.  For example, at first the company worked on Socket B (LGA 1366), and then drastically switches to Socket R (LGA 2011) and further on to 2011-v3.  The computing power of this equipment is naturally different.  But do not forget that small companies usually sell servers; it‚Äôs hard to imagine that they will sell it for a pittance when switching to new capacity from a 1366 socket.  Firstly, it will talk about the wrong view of the company on its own efficiency (after all, such a server can be used), and secondly, this is a giant alarm for you: there is clearly something wrong with the server.  So these ads should be wary. <br>  There is another option: recycling companies.  According to the internal rules of many large companies, the old servers do not sell - they are utilized.  The further fate of the servers depends on the decency of the company engaged in recycling.  It often happens that the equipment is immersed in cars, the acts are signed, but where this car goes - only the recycling company knows.  No one says that everyone does this, because recycling is a legislative matter, but nobody is insured against it either. <br>  Hence the moral: if you see an offer to sell a fairly powerful and not very old used server, then there are two options - either the equipment is stolen, or it is out of service. <br><br>  Of course, no one argues that everything is so bad and that buying a used server from the hands is an impossible task.  First of all, you should understand that buying a used server is, in fact, buying a cat in a bag.  The probability that it will work immediately and will last you for many years is 50 to 50. The option that the seller will sell you at least some working equipment is difficult to calculate at all, because your experience plays a big role, and even more important is luck .  But where in our reality with the "gray" purchases without the "gray" offices and markets.  They buy used equipment, which is written off by state institutions, schools, resell companies (we will tell about this in more detail below);  then check the servers, components and then resell with their own two-week warranty. <br><br><h3>  The story of the ads that you see if, then by chance </h3><br>  As sellers-dealers themselves say, part of their work is their own monitoring of ads.  No one denies that Avito can find ads with real working servers that sell closing companies.  But there is a nuance: most likely, you, as a private person, will either not see this ad, or you will, but it is too late.  The fact is that after the publication of such an announcement, calls to the company begin already in the first 15 minutes, and here the real fight begins between the "gray" sellers.  The one who can come faster and buy more at an attractive price usually wins.  Of course, luck can also smile to a private person, but only if he succeeds in calling these sacred 15 minutes and the seller finds himself in a neighboring yard.  The equipment that will eventually remain is illiquid, which means inoperative and unnecessary. <br><br><h3>  What to check when buying used servers and how to recognize them in advance? </h3><br>  In general, with regard to the purchase of used equipment from the hands, you must remember: the seller should not bring the server to you, but show it.  Most Avito sellers say that they either have no place to show, or no opportunity to do it.  And if the seller does not have the opportunity, then buying such a server is pointless.  You should not just check that the server is working after connecting to the outlet, because it means absolutely nothing.  With the server, anything can happen: move off the RAID, the server itself can overheat, or be overheated during operation.  We must not forget that the server, like any equipment, has its own warranty period, and something can break in it during this period.  And repair of motherboards is a very relative concept, therefore, as a rule, they are often ‚Äúdrained‚Äù. <br><br>  Wherever you buy a server, we recommend first of all to check its appearance: whether it is covered with dust and dirt, how much the body is intact, whether it is damaged or deformed.  For example, if you get your hands on a perfectly laundered server, which shows fluid leaks, which still smell like alcohol or soldering, then this is a sure sign that he visited a service center: there the equipment is thoroughly wiped before starting work, and can no longer mean that the server will work at 100%.  Strangely enough, an even layer of dust on the PCB and the signs that the server was just blown away, give much more guarantees of its serviceability. <br><br>  Further, like any equipment, the server must be ‚Äúrun in‚Äù.  If possible, try to do it immediately and with the seller.  Most often, for the detection of critical problems enough half an hour of running in stress mode.  If the stress test is passed by the server, you can safely take it.  Do not forget also that a half-hour test is still not enough to correctly determine the performance of the equipment.  In addition, it should be borne in mind that not every seller agrees to tolerate you for half an hour.  Therefore, after purchasing the server you need to put on the run for at least a day, and it is better to use all two weeks, which are usually voiced as a warranty period.  You can not lose sight of the trick inherent in some sellers.  You can be given as much time as you need to check the equipment, but with the condition of using the equipment of the seller and using his own testing.  Already it sounds suspicious, is not it?  Alas, but it often happens that the test passes in such a way that the buyer simply does not notice the shoals that exist. <br><br>  One example is known to all sellers in the "gray" and not very market.  ‚ÄúExample‚Äù this Avito is called Semyon with an office at the Polezhaevskaya metro station, and Semyon sells reconditioned and repaired video cards.  The range of video cards is huge, the tests can be done right on the spot, but only on its equipment.  The video card seems to be working, but it often happens that later it does not work anywhere else.  We do not claim that Semen is a bad seller and a deceiver.  However, his ‚Äúcolleagues in the shop‚Äù are surprised every time how he still manages not only to stay afloat, but also to earn on video cards, the initial cost of which is $ 10. <br><br>  When buying a server, you need to check all the slots, the operation of the onboard RAID controller and PCI Express slots, as well as the SATA connectors and the SAS controller.  It is also necessary to be attentive to all network ports: they may be faulty, say, if the server experienced a thunderstorm, during which half of the ports were knocked out.  These checks are very important, because anything can be found out.  For example, one of our clients even before starting work with us acquired a used server - an expensive, reliable, brand.  After the first tests, it was revealed that everything works, but it was worth loading the server with iron, as it stopped running, and in none of the configurations.  Two weeks later, experts found out that only half of the channels worked for the motherboard, of which, of course, the seller kept silent. <br><br>  In addition, do not forget that even if you acquire new equipment for you, someone has already used the equipment.  You should not load the new server with critical or important data - this is how you first of all protect your work from downtime. <br><br>  After the "physical" test and other tests, change the hard drives if they come with the server.  They can even not be checked - only waste time: even if during the run the disks may seem to you to be stably working and properly formatted, you do not know what kind of data they used to store before, and whether they are compromised.  In addition, you have no guarantee of the safety of your own data.  It‚Äôs safest to put in new hardy right away - this way you will protect both yourself and your company. <br><br>  The main rule: the person who not only saw the server twice in his life, but also really understands the hardware, should be engaged in testing and further equipment operation.  It may sound too obvious, but more often than not problems arise after a server has been bought when an inexperienced user reaches for it.  It sounds rude, but we all know that the majority of users actually turn out to be crooked, as they say, and system administrators are not always an exception to this rule. <br><br>  A simple example from the life of the warranty department of one of the largest Russian distributors of computer and digital equipment, components, network and office equipment.  One of their clients - a company that does not possess any knowledge of server hardware - always seeks to repair and upgrade equipment on its own.  Naturally, when the server dies after such manipulations, the employees break the phones of the service and call a specialist.  He has been repairing and putting everything in place for the third year in a row, and then they call him again: the clients have opened everything again, and again nothing works.  A vicious circle that can not be broken. <br><br>  But even experienced users can not always at the testing stage 100% declare that the used server is in working condition.  Maximum - by 90%.  Here it concerns not so much servers in general, but in its components.  For example, with regard to RAID-adapters, it is often very difficult to determine for what reason it is sold, some kind of error can be detected, for example, in a month.  In this regard, the used equipment market is at the same time reliable and not; after all, even the most conscientious seller will never give you a full guarantee that the server will be fully operational.  As one of the sellers we interviewed said, ‚Äúsecond-hand is always a risk, so if you want to save money, be ready for some particular dance with a tambourine.‚Äù <br><br><h3>  What servers to buy? </h3><br>  For a start, it's easier to tell what we would advise buying, namely, used Russian-made servers.  The fact is that domestic manufacturers of servers, like cars, have not yet reached the level of foreign companies.  In addition, most often domestic producers work mainly for tenders and often collect their equipment from cheap imported materials.  The same goes for Chinese and Taiwanese manufacturers. <br><br>  Separately, sellers of used equipment allocate servers manufactured by Intel.  As you already know, Intel is no longer engaged in their release, but this does not mean that these servers are not for sale.  Their problem is similar to the problems of the ‚ÄúBig Three‚Äù, only in multiple sizes.  Intel servers are even more capricious, do not work with most processors and RAM, and are not susceptible to third-party products. <br><br>  The most popular and cheap used servers are made on the basis of motherboards with LGA 771 (previous generations are no longer on the market).  They are still interesting by the fact that quad-core first appeared on this socket, and after them eight-core processors.  Plus, this solution has an affordable price: it varies from 5 to 10 thousand rubles. <br><br>  But, of course, many more well-known brands immediately come to mind.  Someone even remembers the "big three": HP, Dell and IBM (now Lenovo).  The user loyalty of Russians to brands plays into their hands: such giants ‚Äúmust have good equipment‚Äù.  Of course, who will not be attracted by the opportunity to buy such a server, and even for little money. <br><br>  However, there is one caveat: if you decide to put other components in the server, then this will be a real headache for you, especially if your goal is to save.  As in the latest generations of servers from other manufacturers, the three servers of the three can be supplied, respectively, with components only directly from the manufacturer or those that have been certified and received the necessary markings (this applies to earlier generations).  In the latter case, another problem may arise: the components have already been discontinued, and they can only be bought second-hand.  In addition, each manufacturer has its own small features.  For example, IBM drives are attached to the sled with special TORX screws (a kind of slot of threaded fasteners in the shape of a six-pointed star), and buying a screwdriver to unscrew them can turn into a real quest. <br><br>  The price, by the way, is a controversial factor when buying used servers from HP, Dell or IBM.  Yes, when you buy a refurbished server, you can save money, but in the case of the ‚ÄúBig Three‚Äù, this is not the way you would like.  Reliability will have to be paid, even if someone has already used this reliability before you. <br><br>  In general, if you are buying used servers and choosing the ‚Äúbig three‚Äù from the hands, it is probably not worth it.  HP and Dell are capricious, and the necessary components for them are difficult to get, IBM is already so old that they can only provide noise, roar and low power.  Brand servers are distinguished by a small list of compatibility and closure of the BIOS.  Most likely, the purchase of such servers will cost you half the cost, but you need to be prepared for the fact that you have to lay out the other half to make it work. <br>  You should also consider the configuration of these servers and recall the question that we mentioned earlier: ‚ÄúWhy is this server for sale?‚Äù.  Most often, such servers are disposed of only in the event of a malfunction, so perhaps you just get a box with glands. <br><br>  But this does not mean that there are no alternatives on the market at all. <br><br><h3>  Supermicro </h3><br>  Supermicro is one of the most popular solutions at the moment.  It seems to be the same server, but at a lower price.  Especially prized boards that are compatible with almost any component.  Often Supermicro is the so-called self-assembly, which is not scary to buy, even if it is used.  If in the case of branded servers it is difficult to find suitable components, in the case of Supermicro it can be redrawn "by itself".  This is a kind of modular solutions among servers. <br><br>  However, compared to the ‚Äúbig three‚Äù, these servers are not so reliable: yet, not without reason, depending on the server configuration, their prices are almost half as low.  Plus, Supermicro still has no official representative office in Russia, which makes it difficult to get technical support through distributors. <br><br><h3>  Used among us </h3><br>  In fact, it is impossible to say with certainty that your new and externally beautiful server was not previously in use.  Even if you buy it absolutely legally, for big money and, as they say, in the ‚Äúwhite‚Äù office for ‚Äúwhite‚Äù documents.  In general, if there is a guarantee from the manufacturer or distributor, it is not so important whether the equipment is used or not.  The main thing is that it works, and in case of a malfunction there is a warranty department.  Although if you have one server, and he got up, or you simply have nowhere to transfer power from this server, and you will have more than one day to solve issues with a guarantee, then you have big problems. <br><br>  Sellers told us such an example.  We bought "for clients" distribution from a "white" office according to "white" documents expensive server hard drives.  The seller, being a reinsurer, decided to test the equipment.  Surprisingly, it turned out that the disks had already been ‚Äúunder warranty‚Äù twice, and all the errors were forced into the service sector.  :   ETegro Technologies  ,        Hyperion RS125 G4 ,      Foxconn. <br><br>      ,  /      ,           . <br><br><h3>      </h3><br>            . <br><br><h3>   ‚Äî       / . </h3><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In this case, you get not just a used one, but a server restored to the state of almost new one. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">That is, it has already been checked by the company itself, cleaned up, and, most likely, the non-working or poorly working elements are replaced. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In addition, you will receive a warranty on the server, as well as technical support during its operation. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">On the one hand, it sounds good and beautiful, but at the same time you should understand that the equipment together with these services will cost you more. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And again, when the warranty case occurs, be prepared for the fact that for at least several days your server will simply not work.</font></font><br><br><h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> Buy with hands </font></font></h3><br>      ?   ,      ?                .   ,   ,   :  ,        ‚Äî         .    ,      ,  -     .          .       ,   :   ¬´¬ª  eBay,             . <br><br><h3>   </h3><br> ,  /  ‚Äî            ¬´  ¬ª      .   ,       ,                           ,     ,  .          ,       ,           ,        ,       . <br><br>   <a href="http://netrack.ru/">NetRack</a>              -,   ,       .  ,          ,    ‚Äî   . <br><br>   ,      ,  <a href="http://storedata.ru/">   TIER III</a>     . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/313742/">https://habr.com/ru/post/313742/</a></p>
