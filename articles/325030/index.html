It is impossible to know in advance the answers to all the questions that the employer will ask you.  However, there are a few common questions to prepare for.  Successful answers to these questions do not guarantee you a job, but they <em>will increase</em> your chances of success.  Remember that your answer must be adjusted in accordance with the job description and company activities. </p><br><p>  In this article, I will give you seven basic questions on the UX interview, and I will also tell you how best to answer them. </p><a name="habracut"></a><br><h3>  1. What is UX design?  Why is it needed?  How do you explain the UX design process? </h3><br><h4>  Here they are trying to find out if you have a basic knowledge of UX design. </h4><br><p>  Even if this question is quite general, you need to answer it specifically.  Focus on determining who <em>you</em> are as a designer.  Your answer should be clear and accessible.  Imagine that you explain this to a 10-year-old child. </p><br><p>  When asked why you need UX design, try to show that you like the way the company relates to the design.  You can also tell a story about your attitude to design and the importance of customer orientation. <br></p><p>  When answering the question ‚ÄúHow do you explain the UX design process?‚Äù, Focus on the following areas: </p><br><ul><li>  <a href="http://www.uxbooth.com/articles/complete-beginners-guide-to-design-research/" rel="nofollow noopener">User research</a> </li><li>  Usability </li><li>  Information architecture </li><li>  User Interface Design </li><li>  <a href="http://www.uxbooth.com/articles/complete-beginners-guide-to-interaction-design/" rel="nofollow noopener">Interaction Design (Eng.)</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://johnnyholland.org/2009/06/what-is-an-experience-strategy/" rel="nofollow noopener">Experience Strateg (Eng.)</a> </li></ul><br><p>  Tip: When defining a UX design, focus on the importance of defining the user for whom you are creating the product.  Usually this means that the UX designer should conduct surveys, interview the target audience to collect useful data. </p><br><br><h3>  2. What is your design process?  Describe the methods you use. </h3><br><h4>  Here they are trying to figure out what you really are. </h4><br><p>  When you begin to explain the design creation process, you can either describe a potential approach to a typical project (well) or show how you worked on projects in the past (better).  Tell us about your projects through stories: </p><br><ul><li>  Follow specific steps: project background, opportunity, process, ups and downs, end result. </li><li>  <em>Be specific</em> when describing the steps you have taken from concept to final product. </li><li>  Take into account the context of your design.  Different UX conditions require different UX processes.  Your strength will be to identify the process that is most appropriate in a given situation. </li></ul><br><p>  Do not be afraid that your process will differ from the work methods of other designers.  The main thing is to show a <em>rationale for</em> why you decided to do just that. </p><br><p>  Tip: It would be nice if you talked about a user-oriented approach and a thorough analysis of both user and business goals.  It will be even more effective to show this in a <em>specific</em> project. </p><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/921/c31/147/921c311476fba82218b25da59cf044a7.jpg" alt="user-centered-design">

      Source: <a href="http://blog.usabilla.com/a-cry-for-looking-to-other-methods-for-user-centered-design/" rel="nofollow noopener">Usabilla</a> <p></p><br><p>  In addition, in your story, cover the following topics in the context of your projects: </p><br><ul><li>  <i>User Analysis</i> : What methods did you use?  Why these methods? </li><li>  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persona_%2528user_experience%2529" rel="nofollow noopener"><em>Character (User Personas)</em></a> : How did you create characters?  How many characters have you created?  How did this help you? </li><li>  <a href="http://bigdoor.com/blog/2013/11/01/a-quick-guide-to-customer-journey-mapping/" rel="nofollow noopener"><em>Customer Journey Map</em></a> <em>and</em> <a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2012/01/stop-designing-pages-start-designing-flows/" rel="nofollow noopener"><em>User Flows</em></a> : What does your map include? </li><li>  <em>Prototyping:</em> Describe how you went from a primary prototype (for example, a sketch on a piece of paper) to a quality prototype (for example, interactive prototypes in <a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/experience-design.html" rel="nofollow noopener">Adobe XD</a> ).  How many and which iterations were done during prototyping?  What difficulties have you encountered? </li><li>  <em>Metrics and analytics</em> : Explain, with quantitative data, the increase in registrations, sales, or other changes as a result of your design decisions. </li></ul><br><h3>  3. How do you work with other designers, programmers, project managers? </h3><br><h4>  Here they are trying to find out if you fit into the company culture. </h4><br><p>  Your interviewer wants to understand your work style.  Design is a team sport and, as a UX designer, you need to know how to effectively communicate your decisions to the whole team. </p><br><p>  Keep in mind that each team member probably sees this project from their point of view.  However, you need to be able to communicate with all of them in order to quickly prevent any problems or misunderstandings. </p><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/1b4/c53/4a6/1b4c534a6bd244e9ab480a316bac25f9.jpg"><br>  Source: <a href="http://melissaperri.com/2016/01/17/pmvsux/" rel="nofollow noopener">Melissa Perri</a> <br><br><p>  The ability to <em>empathize and understand the motivations of</em> colleagues is an important quality.  Developers, product managers and designers have different goals and objectives.  If you demonstrate that you are listening to them, then you will be well received: </p><br><ul><li>  <em>Developers -</em> For effective collaboration with developers, try to understand the workflow and get a good idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe limitations and possibilities. </li><li>  <em>Product Managers -</em> To work well with product managers, remember to convert prototypes to a detailed description, usually in the form of detailed stories. </li><li>  <em>Designers -</em> Designers usually compare and compare various options for a long time, and then arrange structured critical sessions.  typically have continuous cycles of pairing and siloing followed by structured critique sessions.  The key to success is self-awareness of how you work and demonstration of flexibility. </li></ul><br><p>  Tip: In answering this question, ask your interviewer to describe the current team structure, roles, and existing processes.  Ask about the problems they are currently facing.  You can present your experience in a possible solution to the problems of the company.  Let the interviewer see how you want to apply your skills and experience not only in your position, but also for the success of the company. </p><br><br><h3>  4. How do you decide what features to add to your product? </h3><br><h4>  Here they are trying to figure out whether you can confirm or disprove the hypothesis to create a new solution. </h4><br><p>  This question is very complex, as it depends on the context.  If you are asked during the development of a new software, you can tell how to develop a minimally viable product ( <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_viable_product" rel="nofollow noopener">MVP</a> ). </p><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/54a/378/007/54a378007388e2344811906933192c75.jpg"><br>  Source: <a href="https://brainhub.eu/blog/what-is-mvp/" rel="nofollow noopener">Brainhub</a> <br><br><p>  If the question is asked in the context of an existing product, you should focus on the basic principles of the <a href="http://blog.invisionapp.com/how-to-develop-a-product-strategy/" rel="nofollow noopener">product strategy</a> ( <a href="http://blog.invisionapp.com/how-to-develop-a-product-strategy/" rel="nofollow noopener">product strategy</a> (Eng.)).  Before moving on to specific features, you will need to have a clear picture of your business goals and user needs.  You must be prepared to answer the following questions: </p><br><ul><li>  Who is your user? </li><li>  What are user goals? </li><li>  Why does the user need this feature?  What problem does it solve? </li></ul><br><p>  Tip: A great opportunity to show how you will use user research to test solutions.  Often with an unsolvable problem, the collection of many user data can help move forward.  After enough data has been collected and the user's goals are verified, you can determine which new features best fit your business goals. </p><br><br><h3>  5. Tell us about the project that you are most proud of. </h3><br><h4>  Here they are trying to figure out your strengths and weaknesses. </h4><br><p>  This is a tricky question.  Responding to it, candidates usually feel calm.  However, the interviewer then asks additional questions about the process, thinking, interaction with other team members.  The question allows you to assess the skills of the candidate without asking about it directly.  Therefore, it is best to answer truthfully and clearly.  Do not exaggerate their contribution to the project. </p><br><p>  Tip: Note that the question does not contain the word "UX".  So do not be afraid to talk about projects in other areas. </p><br><br><h3>  6. Tell us about the UX project, which did not go as planned. </h3><br><h4>  Here they are trying to figure out if you can critically evaluate the work. </h4><br>  In no case <em>do</em> not pretend that you have never had such projects.  Making mistakes is a common part of working life.  It is important to show <em>how</em> you coped with them.  We need to find an honest example that will show: <br><br><ul><li>  Something went wrong </li><li>  Why it went wrong </li><li>  What did you do to solve the problem? </li><li>  What have you learned </li></ul><br><p>  Tip: It is important to admit a mistake and then present an effective solution to the problem.  We all learn from mistakes. </p><br><h3>  7. What do you think is the future of UX design? </h3><br><h4>  Here they are trying to find out if you think ahead. </h4><br><p>  Use this question as an opportunity to show your love for UX design and its potential.  Here are a couple of topics that you can focus on.  <a href="http://macaw.co/" rel="nofollow noopener">The development of new prototyping tools that save time for developers and designers (eng.)</a> .  <a href="https://medium.com/salesforce-ux/7-things-every-designer-needs-to-know-about-accessibility-64f105f0881b">Design for universal access, which allows users with different capabilities to successfully use your interface (English).</a> </p><br><p>  Tip: This question is an excellent opportunity to talk about your vision of the future of virtual or augmented reality. </p><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/579/085/b84/579085b84b55848e9443a3d56e170c83.gif"><br>  The rise of virtual reality.

Who do you follow in this industry? </h3><br><h4>  Here they are trying to find out what inspires and motivates you. </h4><br><p>  Tell us about the blogs and books you read, the conferences you have visited, and the people you follow. </p><br><p>  List of my favorite blogs (in free order): </p><br><ul><li>  <a href="https://alistapart.com/blog" rel="nofollow noopener">Alistapart</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://designmodo.com/" rel="nofollow noopener">Designmodo</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://www.uxbooth.com/" rel="nofollow noopener">Ux booth</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://uxmastery.com/" rel="nofollow noopener">UXMastery</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://www.dtelepathy.com/blog/" rel="nofollow noopener">Digital telepathy</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://52weeksofux.com/" rel="nofollow noopener">52 Weeks of UX</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://www.uxmatters.com/" rel="nofollow noopener">Uxmatters</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://uxmyths.com/" rel="nofollow noopener">Ux myths</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://blog.usabilla.com/" rel="nofollow noopener">Usabilla</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://blog.intercom.com/" rel="nofollow noopener">Intercom blog</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://www.usertesting.com/blog/" rel="nofollow noopener">UserTesting blog</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/" rel="nofollow noopener">Nielsen Norman Group blog</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/" rel="nofollow noopener">Smashing magazine</a> </li></ul><br><p>  For whom I follow: </p><br><ul><li>  <a href="https://www.uie.com/" rel="nofollow noopener">Jared spool</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://www.lukew.com/ff/" rel="nofollow noopener">Luke Wroblewski</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://karenmcgrane.com/" rel="nofollow noopener">Karen McGrane</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://ia.net/topics/" rel="nofollow noopener">Oliver reichenstein</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/author/don-norman/" rel="nofollow noopener">Don norman</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://www.peterme.com/" rel="nofollow noopener">Peter Merholz</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://medium.com/%40joulee">Julie Zhuo</a> </li></ul><br><p>  And a list of references for those who want to deepen their knowledge of UX design :: </p><br><ul><li>  Don Norman's <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/0465050654" rel="nofollow noopener">The Design of Everyday Things</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/1118766571/" rel="nofollow noopener">About Face: The Essentials of Interaction Design</a> by Alan Cooper </li><li>  <a href="http://shapeofdesignbook.com/" rel="nofollow noopener">The Shape of Design</a> by Frank Chimero </li><li>  <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/0321767535/" rel="nofollow noopener">100 Things Every Designer</a> by Susan Weinschenk </li><li>  Donna Spencer <a href="http://uxmastery.com/practical-ia/" rel="nofollow noopener">Practical Guide to Information Architecture</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/0321965515" rel="nofollow noopener">Don't Make Me Think</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/0321657292" rel="nofollow noopener">Rocket Surgery Made Easy</a> by Steve Krug </li><li>  Jesse James Garrett's <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/0321683684" rel="nofollow noopener">Elements of User Experience: User-Centered Design for the Web and Beyond</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://abookapart.com/products/designing-for-emotion" rel="nofollow noopener">Designing for Emotion</a> by Aarron Walter </li><li>  <a href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/designing-interactions" rel="nofollow noopener">Designing Interactions</a> by Bill Moggridge </li><li>  <a href="https://gettingreal.37signals.com/" rel="nofollow noopener">Getting Real</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/0307463745/" rel="nofollow noopener">Rework</a> by Jason Fried and David Heinemeier Hansson (Basecamp) </li><li>  <a href="http://rosenfeldmedia.com/books/prototyping/" rel="nofollow noopener">Prototyping A Practitioner's Guide</a> by Todd Zaki Warfel </li></ul><br><h3>  A question that is missing </h3><br><p>  You may ask why my list does not include the pervasive question ‚ÄúWhy should I hire you?‚Äù.
