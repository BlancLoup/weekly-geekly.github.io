  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How to increase productivity when reading.</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"> Those who write a blog read a lot.  This is an axiom.  There are certainly exceptions.  But for this, there are exceptions to confirm the rules. <br><br>  As for me, the reverse is true.  Those who read a lot write blogs.  And one of the most important reasons for this phenomenon is the desire to discuss the material that is read.  Plus, the natural desire to somehow systematize the existing deposits, and boast of the accumulated in the network and invented by himself.  So in this post I really want to talk on the stated topic.  English source <a href="http://vandelaydesign.com/blog/blogging/10-tips-to-retain-more-of-what-you-read-online/">here</a> .  And my understanding of everything that is written in it, below. <br><br>  In the modern world, we are forced to absorb ever-increasing amounts of information.  And do it on a weekly, or even daily basis.  In any case, if you do business online, blog, read something from work or just for fun, I am sure you can get more benefits if you memorize more from what you read.  The Internet allows you to quickly find and get acquainted with the huge amounts of information.  Primary sources and recycled material.  But how much can you keep in your long-term memory?  Here are 10 tips on how to help yourself in this matter. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  1.Read, recite, review.  Cool at the author succeeded.  Three R. And in Russian it will be, as usual, three-step.  Read, Repeat, Revisit.  The process of active reading implies that you will make stops, in order to trace out the information that is important to you.  Outlineing allows you to save key points that most fully reflect the essence of the topic in question, or to draw attention to incomprehensible and contradictory points.  They are also a source of information during the subsequent review.  If the quotations for me are clear and understandable, then as a rule, I have causal consequences that clarify the picture of what has been said.  If, on the contrary, something outlined to me is alien and incomprehensible, this sign will return and re-read the material relating directly to this quotation.  The emergence of my site and my first posts were just the result of such an active reading.  In addition, in the conditions of interrupted reading, when I sometimes return to books after a long break, this saves time, not only on what to read quotes much faster than the entire book, but also simply to find a place from which to read further is much easier.  Another point related to active reading.  By the way, how to read online or e-books, we all already know a little (here and readers and organizers and google notebook and lots of other lotions), but we gradually forget about how ‚Äúactively‚Äù to read books.  I just recently finished reading a very good book.  Yes, yes it is a paper book.  But when I wanted to write a small report about her, I realized that I was caught.  Agree, no one is sitting with a book in front of a computer.  With a book it is good to lie.  But about the use of the marker, I just forgot.  And even what I remember, about what I would like to write, does not help.  In the absence of electronic search and other conveniences, in order to write several excerpts now, it is necessary to re-read the book.  Well, either carry gag.  In addition to the marker, the presence of bookmarks and pointers (maybe the marker itself) will significantly increase the speed of reading.

      2. Cut the fat.  Well, or easier - cut all unnecessary.  If you use RSS reader to read, then go through all your subscriptions and delete everything that is not mandatory for you, and without which you can do.  I think that this is the standard way for everyone who starts using this ingenious invention of the Internet.  First, the reader to the eyeballs stuffed with all sorts of useful links.  Then there is an attempt to read at least the headlines of all past news.  When it becomes clear that this is not realistic, the person begins to clear the whole story, and tries to keep track of new arrivals.  Then there is an attempt to streamline, speed up, spread on the most important, required for daily viewing and less relevant.  And then it begins to seem that the use of the reader does not give any advantage.  Finally, a person understands that his bandwidth is limited.  And what better to miss something important than endlessly shoveling mountains of information manure.  Gradually, you come to the conclusion that it is better to keep the newly added subscriptions for some time under observation and to delete them in case of anything.  That it is necessary to delete channels without regret, and to add very, very carefully.  Especially if it is the so-called aggregators, the number of news on which can reach hundreds per day.  When it comes to an individual author, I add it to my subscription without any problems.  Maximum, after some time I will delete it.  But with portals, forums and aggregators you need to be very, very careful.  In the beginning, I, like many, gladly subscribed to news feeds, both regular and specialized.  And I thought that looking through the headers and deleting messages, I will just stay up to date with what is happening.  Two weeks later, after not reading the records passed for a thousand, I unsubscribed from the majority of subscriptions to these time eaters.  Because it is my time, and therefore money.  Well, then, if you still do not use the RSS reader, then it may be enough to convince yourself that the world is square.  It gives savings and it is verified. <br><br>  3. Start acting.  We all remember read things better if they fit into our value system through practical application.  You can, like me, learn English for decades, but without constant practice it is not effective.  My translations of articles now give me more experience and more memorization of words, something when I memorized just words.  If you are reading something that seems useful to you, start using it right now.  No one has ever become richer just by reading and absorbing information.  Somewhere I came across such an example that one woman collected a lot of recipes for cooking various dishes, but she never cooked anything.  Of course, this is ridiculous, but only until you remember how many books you read on one of the topics, and how many of these you really use in your daily practice. <br><br>  4. Read when you can be as focused as possible.  Choose a time when you are the most productive, and are able to work with the material with maximum efficiency.  Setting the schedule, and the allocation of special time will also contribute to a better perception.  Do not read when you are in a hurry.  And what about those time management tips that recommend using the intervals between meetings, traveling in public transport, etc.?  for reading?  Probably, it is more correct to leave these moments for reading something pleasant and not requiring mandatory memorization. <br><br>  5. Understand and use graphic text elements.  If the author wants to draw your attention, he can use different fonts, graphic elements, styles to highlight and divide material into groups.  Understanding and paying attention to these elements can significantly speed up the learning process.  But this especially helps when re-viewing or when searching for some specific information about already familiar material.  Yes, and you yourself can mark in any way you accept, one or another type of information given in the material.  Remember, earlier it was called marginal notes and the use of bullets. <br><br>  6. Create a map of what you read.  Mapping involves several basic steps that can increase the productivity of your reading.  This is primarily an awareness of the goal you are pursuing while reading this or that material.  Next, you need to find and save keywords and phrases.  And finally, you need to focus on the information that is directly related to your goals, skipping irrelevant information.  I did not create maps, but I remember exactly how I read my first thick book.  It was in the school library, and the book was given for a couple of hours, not more.  So then I missed all descriptions of the nature, things and subtleties of the relationship, reading only paragraphs with monologues and descriptions of actions.  Surely I missed something important, but since my goal was to learn about all the adventures and the result, it was acceptable. <br><br>  7. Print the pages of interest to you.  Sometimes this solution will be as simple and useful as possible, and most importantly autonomous.  You can take this material with you and pay attention to it when it is convenient for you.  And sometimes it‚Äôs also pleasant to read not from the monitor. <br><br>  8. Write notes, outline in the process of reading.  Not for nothing at all sorts of lectures and seminars made to take notes.  On particularly advanced study holidays, a brief summary or outline of the material is distributed in advance.  But above all, the recording of the main points and ideas makes it possible to reiterate them both in our memory and on paper, with a view to the subsequent return to the material. <br><br>  9. Creating a plan of the article.  If you write the outline of the article, it will help you not only to better remember the component parts, but also to better understand the relationship between the structural elements of the article and their influence on the whole picture. <br><br>  10.Use bookmark manager.  When you surf the Internet, you always come across some services, or information that you will probably use in the future.  In addition, now people tend to go to the Internet from different computers.  Therefore, the use of any service that allows you to store bookmarks centrally on the Internet becomes really critical.  There is no lack of such services, and free ones, now, and everyone can choose the most suitable option for themselves.  I personally prefer GOOGLE NOTE, with which I implement virtually all items, from 5 to 10. Accordingly, with all the advantages of GOOGLE. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/20352/">https://habr.com/ru/post/20352/</a></p>
