I am <a href="https://www.facebook.com/siba.piranha">Vanya Solovyov</a> , design director at <i>DocDoc</i> (part of the Sberbank group).  Today heading <i>Dream-Tim</i> , which tells how to create a dream team. <br><br>  Last year we faced problems that came from two sides: from designers and the company. <br><br><h2>  Designer </h2><br>  <i>‚ÄúHow to ask for a salary increase, and if you don‚Äôt raise it?‚Äù</i> , <i>‚ÄúWhere to develop further, maybe, on which courses to go?‚Äù</i> .  These and other questions lead the designer to a halt and directly affect the quality of work. <br><blockquote>  It is not clear how much for the year will grow in wages and what to do? </blockquote>  Designers want to grow, get more money, and this is normal.  But to raise such questions is difficult.

    <h2>  Company </h2><br><a name="habracut"></a>  When a company is steadily developing and growing, it is important that employees keep up with the overall pace and continue to expand their knowledge and expertise. <cut></cut><br><blockquote>  How to systematize the development of designers in the right direction? </blockquote><br>  In the opposite case, inertia is a reason for reducing and searching for a new candidate. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/63e/a26/099/63ea2609969fe7b68b9e2be12204021d.png" alt="image"><br><br><h2>  Designer Level 6 </h2><br>  To solve these problems, we abandoned the basic role system: Junior, Middle, Senor.  Well, really, is it really cool to feel like a ‚Äúbeginner middle‚Äù when a colleague and friend are ‚Äúcool senor‚Äù? <br><br>  Instead, they introduced a system of levels: 9 for product designers and 6 for design managers.  Only one entity remained - the ‚Äúdesigner‚Äù, but of different levels. <br><br><h2>  How was the description of the levels </h2><br>  Requirements proceeded from what we expect from the designer at a particular level of development.  I am sure that most food companies have similar needs. <br><blockquote>  From the designer of level 5, we are waiting for strong hard skills, and from the designer of level 7 - a good leveling of soft skills. </blockquote><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/7c1/2ee/1b7/7c12ee1b796aeeac13df389777736399.png" alt="image"><br>  <i>Levels and roles of product designers.</i>  <i>At the end of the article link to the table.</i> <i><br></i> <br><br>  ‚ÄúRoles and Responsibilities‚Äù and ‚ÄúSkills and Requirements‚Äù were common for some levels.  This is the vector of development that the designer must adhere to. <br><br>  However, the ‚ÄúTransition Conditions‚Äù and ‚ÄúTheoretical Base‚Äù are unique for each level.  These are key indicators of transition to the next level. <br><br><h2>  "Features-points" </h2><br>  One of the measurements of key indicators were ‚Äúfeatures-points‚Äù.  This is when the designer tracks and evaluates which of his tasks have reached the metrics. <br><br>  Grades are set on a 5-point scale.  Tasks that affect conversion get more points than tasks for other metrics. <br><br>  For example, a task with a metric in the spirit of ‚Äúmake an image page‚Äù can get 1‚Äì2 points, since  it's hard to measure in money.  But the task with the metric "to achieve a conversion in the application of 12%" can be estimated at 4-5 points. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/cb2/9e0/b60/cb29e0b600c801a23ab5aef14441175e.png" alt="image"><br>  <i>"Features-points" in the presentation of the product designer</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f15/ae6/3ff/f15ae63ff4e8bdd00209a71fc8592ea1.png" alt="image"><br>  <i>"Features-points" in the presentation of the mobile designer</i> <br><blockquote>  Secondary benefits.  When the designer evaluates past tasks, he once again understands that the interface he created directly influenced the business.  + 1 to CSV </blockquote><h2>  When and how do we go to the next level </h2><br>  Apply for a review of the level can be 2 times a year.  First, the designer collects a presentation in which he tells how he fulfilled the conditions of the transition. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d0f/296/320/d0f296320d48546d35df0a86d81c564a.png" alt="image"><br>  <i>Cover presentation of a mobile designer, rolling on level 6.</i>  <i>Charm!</i> <br><br>  Then he sets up a meeting with the participation of: HR-director, product director and design director.  Performs on it with a presentation and answers any questions that may arise. <br><blockquote>  The designer can raise his level and raise the salary up to 2 times a year. </blockquote><br>  If its transfer is approved - bonuses, salary, etc. are agreed.  If failure, then the detailed reason "why." <br><br><h2>  pros </h2><br><h3>  For the designer: </h3><br><ul><li>  allows you to plan growth for the year ahead and not strain at the wage increase; </li><li>  helps to determine where to grow and what is expected of him in the future; </li><li>  collection of information for the presentation helps to evaluate the work done; </li><li>  Preparation for the presentation and public speaking develops soft skills and communication skills. </li></ul><br><h3>  For the company: </h3><br><ul><li>  employee development plan is flexible and changes to the needs of the company without unnecessary processes; </li><li>  the manager is not worried that the designer‚Äôs motivation and productivity may fall; </li><li>  Roles in design are easily scaled by new designers, which leads to the desired consistency in their development. </li></ul><br><h2>  Minuses </h2><br><ul><li>  The current version of roles is only suitable for product designers, but I am sure that in version 2.0 we will be able to adapt it for marketing designers; </li><li>  if the designer does not strive for development, you will see it only in half a year - he will simply miss the opportunity of transition. </li></ul><br><h2>  PS What to do if there are no roles in your company yet? </h2><br><h3>  Captain obvious </h3><br>  If you have the strength and capabilities - create!  The size of the design team does not matter.  The main thing - the desire to make the work of their guys comfortable.  And our <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1A8Ab2XmURAr5vj8AbBKXTYmo-_ypBoPRIyHLFbYMtvU/edit%3Fusp%3Dsharing">role table</a> will be a good start. <br><br>  If there is no strength, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/siba.piranha">write</a> and call for a visit - we will help. <br><br><h3>  Use milestones </h3><br>  Briefly - record the checkpoints of your achievements, approved with the leader and linked to salary or bonuses.  Details - in one of the following articles. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/456362/">https://habr.com/ru/post/456362/</a></p>
