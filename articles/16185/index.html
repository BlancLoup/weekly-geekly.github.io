  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Motivation. Laziness. Training.</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  These three concepts, skillfully balanced among themselves, one hundred percent will give a positive result in your activity (project).  Now I‚Äôll try to explain my idea a little bit, along the way telling the story of my acquaintance with Web technologies in general and with PHP in particular. <br>  <strong>Motivation.</strong>  About 2 years ago, being a student, I started working as an admin in a Lviv newspaper (I also got an interesting story, if you want, I will tell you).  Due to the fact that I myself was not from Lviv and went home every week (for groceries), I always met someone from my acquaintances in an electric train.  Well, in one of these times, I met a good girlfriend, a former classmate.  They agreed, then yes, that, how are you, I work, and what are you doing, I stick on the Internet, oh, but you can send me SMS with the weather, I can and why not.  Here you have the motivation - to make a nice girl. <br>  <strong>Laziness.</strong>  From that day, I first found the site that gave the weather forecast (I want to note that until that time I was not interested in the weather at all ÔÅä) ‚Äîthat became gismeteo.ru, and then, every day, I went to the weather page of Lviv first and then to Kyivstar website for sending sms, copy-paste and sent.  But since I'm a lazy person, I began to think how I could automate it.  And then a friend got a job as a programmer to write websites on php and praised him, well, I asked him to write something to make my life easier.  After a while I received a script, downloaded and installed XAMPP, or I just set up apache + php, well, it doesn‚Äôt matter.  So from it was the simplest parser that mined one dial - the current value of the weather, which was not very suitable for me.  I decided to figure out how it works ... <br>  <strong>Training.</strong>  Yes, the training started right there, because what was written was not clear to me.  I downloaded the manual on php, a couple of html directories and away.  Mal wrote little by little what you need to use mail () and the function of operators in mail2sms to send messages, told friends they also wanted, added a file with subscribers, screwed it onto a server, added to Cron.  Then transferred with a friend to use the database.  Thanks to the ‚ÄúGypsy Mail‚Äù, now there are more than 300 subscribers in the database. <br>  So, thanks to motivation, laziness and learning, I now know how to do something.  True laziness sometimes wants to get the upper hand, but I train it from time to time forcing to do localization of programs and web scripts, as well as write articles.  I hope you like this one. </div>
