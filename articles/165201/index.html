  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Many reasons to be a manager</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  This article is for those who want to try to become a manager, or rather a manager.  I‚Äôll say right away that the work of the manager is not for everyone, not everyone has the right mindset and character.  Not everyone can break their psychological blocks to manage people.  Someone more convenient to work as a mercenary, someone would prefer their business.  But if you decide to become a manager, then this article is for you. <br><br><h4>  1. Another step, in life, career, salary. </h4><br>  Your salary will increase, it will make you freer in many ways.  You will be able to afford to travel more, hire, say, a housekeeper who will simplify your home life.  You will also overcome one of the most powerful barriers in your career.  A manager‚Äôs growth is much higher than a programmer‚Äôs (if a programmer can jump right and left while learning new languages, the manager can jump upwards to manage more people), and good managers are worth their weight in gold and you will always be in demand in the labor market.  It is necessary to understand that the manager doesn‚Äôt need to know often deep-seated technologies, he can always attract an expert in any field to get advice.  The main job of the manager is still to manage, and not to delve into the technology and many other jungle.  Remember that the manager does not have a ceiling, if you have reached your limit in one company, you can easily change it to another and grow further. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h4>  2. Training </h4><br>  Study, study and study once again spoke Lenin.  The manager should always learn, many companies offer to learn something themselves, others simply need to ask if I can go to that seminar or go to risk-reduction courses for a couple of days.  If your company is strongly opposed to training, then just change jobs.

    <h4>  3. Freedom of action </h4><br>  The manager often does not have a clearly described job description.  But it seems to me there are always tasks + tasks you can always set for yourself (you are already a manager and here you have to set tasks for yourself, no matter how embarrassed you are).  But it gives the discomfort of uncertainty (I recommend reading Maxim Spiridonov‚Äôs note about uncertainty and the right attitude towards it), but this also opens up a greater degree of freedom of action + training will allow you to better understand your situation. <br><br><h4>  4. Ability to choose a team </h4><br>  Yes, most likely the manager will be able to choose a team.  Probably you should not immediately dismiss everyone and recruit a new team, but in general, I always surround myself with pleasant specialists and remove everyone who I don‚Äôt like or demotivate the team. <br><br><h4>  5. Global management of their time and time of their subordinates </h4><br>  And most likely it depends on you how much you will have to make all the raises and denominations.  Avraly not sneak up suddenly, they are always visible from afar.  And if a programmer can allow himself to sit quietly, write code and wait for an aground, then you can easily prevent it.  Remember this is your area of ‚Äã‚Äãresponsibility and it is not so difficult to avoid hard-to-hear when avoiding proper work (training here helps novice managers more than ever).  You can also get better working conditions, for example, work from 12 to 18, say, have two vacations of three weeks and more.  To say honestly there are so many ways to avoid irregular working days that sometimes it seems to me that people just want to get it themselves, remember that you don‚Äôt want them and do everything to keep up during working hours (if you don‚Äôt have time to disassemble incoming papers and emails, hire a secretary) . <br><br><h4>  6. Responsibility </h4><br>  Oddly enough, I love the responsibility, as well as to do my job well.  These things give me moral satisfaction and raise my ego.  I advise you to also treat these things. <br><br><h4>  7. Solving complex and non-trivial problems </h4><br>  Here problems are different, complex problems require the involvement of experts and this is usually a complete pleasure for me.  Of the non-trivial problems I will take the most common example is to wash the floor.  To be honest, top management giving such an indication does not expect that you will begin to wash it yourself, but they will be happy if you call the cleaning company or the spare cleaner if the main one is sick. <br><br><h4>  8. Reports and analytics </h4><br>  Reports annoyed me most of my life.  But I always tried to fill them with some kind of life, very honorable reports with clear charts, even the most pleasant to look at them.  Writing an interesting analytics for me is almost like an erotic. <br><br>  The article is based on my subjective management experience.  Yes, much is written here only about the good sides, why you ask?  And why do you want to become a manager?  In order to know the best aspects of this profession or the worst?  When you go to the attraction, you are not interested in the likelihood of the bolt falling off on the mount, but you still ask if it was scary.  Many things may not suit you and this is easily solved by changing jobs.  I quit my first official job because I didn‚Äôt buy a gig flash drive and that‚Äôs enough to go on.  Each job change brought me more money, was more interesting and responsible.  The only time I received a minus to the money I earn is my move to Thailand and freelancing. <br><br>  If I have covered some moments superficially or will be unclear, I will be glad to questions. <br>  If I forgot to add something from the good life of the manager, write in the comments I add to the article. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/165201/">https://habr.com/ru/post/165201/</a></p>
