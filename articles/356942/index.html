      The age-psychological approach to the assessment of the harmful effects of information products on the mental development, health and psychological well-being of children, which formed the basis of the Federal Law ‚ÄúOn the Protection of Children from Information Harmful to their Health and Development‚Äù, showed its rather high efficiency. <br></blockquote><br>  We meet - <a href="http://government.ru/media/files/mPbAMyJ29uSPhL3p20168GA6hv3CtBxD.pdf">‚ÄúThe concept of information security of children‚Äù</a> , approved by the decree of the Government of the Russian Federation of December 2, 2015 No. 2471-p. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  At the beginning of the document it is absolutely rightly noted that: <br><br><blockquote>  The process of socialization through traditional institutions (families, schools) is increasingly complemented by the mass media and mass communications, especially the information and telecommunications network "Internet" ..., which become the most important institutions of socialization, education and enlightenment of the new generation, to some extent replacing the traditionally formed forms.  <strong>This mainly occurs in cases where parents (legal representatives) in the family are suspended from their responsibilities for the upbringing and development of children</strong> and shift them to external players. <br></blockquote><br>  Yes, and a list of goals to strive for is not bad.  With small cuts: <br><blockquote><ul><li>  development of children's skills of independent and responsible consumption of information products; </li><li>  formation of a positive picture of the world and adequate basic ideas about the world and man; </li><li>  raising children‚Äôs responsibility for their lives, health and destiny, overcoming social consumerism and infantilism; </li><li>  the assimilation by children of the system of family values ‚Äã‚Äãand ideas about the family; </li><li>  development of a system of social and interpersonal relations and communication of children; </li><li>  satisfaction and development of cognitive needs and interests of the child, children's curiosity and research activity; </li><li>  development of children's creative abilities; </li><li>  nurturing children‚Äôs tolerance; </li><li>  the development of children's identity (civil, ethnic, and gender); </li><li>  formation of healthy ideas about the sexual life of a person; </li><li>  emotional and personal development of children; </li><li>  the formation of children's feelings of responsibility for their actions in the information space; </li><li>  raising children as independent, responsible and independently minded individuals with the goal of overcoming social dependency. <br></li></ul></blockquote><br>  An interesting look at the purpose of information technologies: "Information and communication technologies <strong>can be key policy elements that contribute to preserving the culture of Russia</strong> , strengthening moral and patriotic principles in the public consciousness, and developing the system of cultural and humanitarian education." <br><br>  The list of principles for ensuring the information security of children states that the state is responsible for "for respecting the legitimate interests of children in the information sphere".  Family responsibility is not even mentioned. <br><br>  It is logical that at the same time ensuring information security should also fall on the state (who is responsible for the result).  And no.  ‚ÄúEnsuring the information security of children is possible only under the condition of an effective combination of state and public efforts <strong>with the decisive role of the family</strong> .‚Äù Therefore, ‚Äúthe most important task is to establish a coordinated interaction between the family, the main institution of socialization and parenting, with the state and all elements of the modern media market content distributors, psychological and pedagogical expert communities and expert communities in the field of artistic  azovaniya ".  It is hard to imagine such an interaction. <br><br>  Returning to filtering information: <br><br><blockquote>  The joint efforts of all participants in the media market should be aimed at minimizing the risks of de-socialization, development and consolidation of the deviant and illegal behavior of children, including such unacceptable forms of behavior, such as: <br><br><ul><li>  aggressive behavior, violence and cruelty towards people and animals; </li><li>  taking actions that threaten the life and (or) health of the child, including the infliction of harm to their health, suicide; </li><li>  the use of narcotic drugs, psychotropic and (or) intoxicating substances, tobacco products, alcoholic and alcohol-containing products, beer and beverages produced on their basis; </li><li>  prostitution; </li><li>  vagrancy; </li><li>  begging; </li><li>  other types of unlawful conduct and / or crimes. </li><li>  ... <br></li></ul><br>  Taking into account the psychological, pedagogical and artistic-cultural aspects in assessing the content of information products in the context of ensuring the information security of children helps to ensure the personal, moral and cultural development of children involved in the global information process. <br></blockquote><br>  A very interesting place describing the further course of action to counter access to prohibited information: <br><br><blockquote>  An important element of this process (note: the vigorous activity of the controlling and law enforcement agencies to curb the facts of illegal distribution) can be the involvement of journalistic communities, self-regulation organizations and public organizations. <br><br>  The state should support the creation and implementation of the activities of organizations of self-regulation of mass media and mass communications, as well as social movements and associations, associations and movements of the parent community, associations of consumers of mass media products, educational and telecommunication services carrying out monitoring (monitoring) and public control functions. over the observance of the legislation of the Russian Federation on mass media and on advertising <br><br>  It is necessary to continue work on improving the mechanism of blocking sites on the Internet that contain prohibited information. <br></blockquote><br>  It can be predicted that the attention of regulatory authorities in the near future will be drawn to the library: <br><br><blockquote>  The process of transition of the Russian Federation to the post-industrial society is accompanied by the sequential computerization of educational institutions and organizations of additional education, other institutions for minors, including children's and youth libraries.  In this regard, it is advisable to provide for the introduction of effective modern hardware and software to protect children from information harmful to their health, moral and spiritual development, ensuring compliance with the established rules of hygiene and safety when using computer equipment.  For this, it is necessary to form a mechanism for the effective use of funds allocated from the federal budget and the budgets of the constituent entities of the Russian Federation for the computerization of schools and children's libraries.  At the same time, it is necessary to ensure in children's and youth libraries (with the preservation of the functions currently exercised by them) the children's safety, by creating appropriate technical and organizational conditions, as well as legal mechanisms. <br></blockquote><br>  Marks the document and some excesses: <br><br><blockquote>  It is inexpedient to expand the interpretation of such terms as ‚Äúviolence and cruelty‚Äù by law enforcers, which can lead to the fact that children will be limited in access to information products of military-historical orientation, which in the conditions of modern society is the most important element in the formation of patriotic convictions among the younger generation. <br><br>  Along with the prohibition of information products that may harm the development and health of the child, the state and society should promote the creation of conditions that ensure a positive socialization and individualization of the child, his psychological well-being and positive world outlook. <br></blockquote><br>  What is expected as a result of the implementation of the Concept?  By 2020: <br><br><blockquote>  A new media environment will be created corresponding to the following characteristics: <br><br><ul><li> the presence of developed information and communication mechanisms aimed at the socialization of the younger generation and the disclosure of its creative potential; <br>  free access of children to the historical and cultural heritage of previous generations; <br>  a qualitative increase in the level of children's media literacy; <br>  <strong>increasing the number of children sharing the values ‚Äã‚Äãof patriotism</strong> ; <br>  harmonization of inter-and intragenerational relations; <br>  promoting a healthy lifestyle among the younger generation; <br>  <strong>formation of a steady demand among children for obtaining high-quality information products</strong> ; <br>  reducing the level of illegal and criminal behavior among children; <br>  <strong>formation of children's respect for intellectual property and copyright, a conscious rejection of the use of "pirated" content</strong> <br></li></ul><br>  The implementation of the Concept is entrusted to the Ministry of Communications and Mass Media of Russia (together with other interested federal executive bodies). <br><br>  It must be said that the Concept is not the only document of this kind.  There is still say <br>  <a href="http://kremlin.ru/acts/bank/35418">The National Action Strategy for Children for 2012‚Äì2017</a> , approved by Presidential Decree No. 761 of June 1, 2012. <br><br>  The document begins with an answer to the question "Who is to blame?" <br><br><blockquote>  The development of high technologies, the country's openness to the world community led to the insecurity of children from illegal content in the Internet information and telecommunications network (hereinafter referred to as the Internet), aggravated problems related to the sale of children, child pornography and prostitution.  According to the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Russia, the number of sites containing materials with child pornography has increased by almost a third, and the number of Internet materials themselves - by 25 times.  A significant number of suicide sites are available to teens at any time. <br></blockquote><br>  How is it proposed to solve the existing problems?  The document is large, I will give just a few paragraphs: <br><br><blockquote>  Protection of the rights of each child.  In the Russian Federation, a system should be established that ensures response to the violation of the rights of each child without any discrimination, including the diagnosis of the situation, planning and taking the necessary set of measures to ensure the observance of the rights of the child and the restoration of the rights violated;  legal education;  provision of rehabilitation assistance to every child who has been the victim of abuse or criminal encroachment. <br><br>  Providing for all children a safe and comfortable family environment in which the rights of the child are respected and any forms of cruel treatment with him are excluded. <br><br>  Developing and approving standards for minimum guarantees of access to income and social services that determine the main indicators of the quality of life of children, including the minimum guaranteed income, guaranteed social housing, family rest and food quality. <br><br>  Formation of a legislative base for reforming the organization of the work of the guardianship and guardianship authorities in the protection of children's rights <br><br>  Creation and dissemination of information on the rights of the child, adapted for children, parents, teachers, professionals working with children and in the interests of children, through the media, the Internet, organizations and institutions for children. <br></blockquote><br>  The words are not bad.  But let us pay attention to the fact that we are not talking about improving the well-being of the family - providing opportunities for earning, increasing benefits, and so on.  This is not about working with parents of psychologists.  Children need a comfortable family environment.  Juvenile justice. <br><br>  But back to the Concept and summarize. <br><br><ol><li>  The state is fully satisfied with the measures and means of filtering access to the Internet - including IP blocking.  Accordingly, no measures to introduce mechanisms that block access to specific pages are not provided; </li><li>  The state has drawn conclusions from their confrontation with the Internet community and is considering the possibility of working with journalists and public associations; </li><li>  The purpose of the Concept (including filtering access to various resources) is (including) the eradication of piracy and the growth of patriotism; </li><li>  The document provides for "the formation of a mechanism for the effective use of funds allocated from the federal budget and the budgets of the constituent entities of the Russian Federation for the computerization of schools and children's libraries," as well as the provision in libraries "(preserving the functions currently exercised) of children's media safety."  Looking forward to checking the validity of the purchase of protective equipment in schools? <br></li></ol></blockquote></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/356942/">https://habr.com/ru/post/356942/</a></p>
