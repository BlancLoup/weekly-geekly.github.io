Now again the 25th of the current month and the time has come for the second monthly release of this award.  This time a few changes have been made to the award.  The most important thing is that now the start of the startups will be in the Habrasoobschestvo itself, and I will only provide information on projects.

      In addition, now not all startups are included in a single rating, and the rating is divided into three categories: “Heavyweight”, “Lightweight” and “Habraapy”. <br>  <strong>“Heavyweights”</strong> <em>(3 Nominees)</em> are projects launched under the wing of large and popular Internet brands, or the launch of which is associated with large investments, or at least ambitions. <br>  <strong>“Lightweight”</strong> <em>(5 Nominees)</em> - Projects run on the money of their ideologues and developers, or business angels.  Projects that do not have behind the big investments or patrons. <br>  <strong>Habrapa</strong> <em>(5 Nominees)</em> - Startups launched by Habrayuser, and announced on Habré. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><h1>  <strong>Heavyweights</strong> </h1><br><br><h3> <a href="http://www.tvidi.ru/"><img title="Tvidi.ru - children's social network" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/022/113/1c8/0221131c855b4a55a914e8684947d385.jpg" width="223" height="92"></a> <br></h3><h3>  <a href="http://www.tvidi.ru/">www.Tvidi.ru</a> </h3><br>  Tvidi.ru is a children's social network, participation in which is possible only by invitation codes, which are distributed mainly offline.  Investments in the project amounted to 6 million dollars, and in three years the network plans to reach 1 million users aged from 7 to 14 years. <br><br>  <strong>Artyom Inyutin (RBC Media General Director):</strong> <em>“Tweegee will provide us with a social network platform, which runs the Israeli portal Tipo.co.il, and we will invest $ 6 million in the project. For us, this is a new category of users that will attract new advertisers.</em>  <em>Now in Russia, millions of children use the Internet, and the market niche of children's online projects is still free. ”</em> <br><br> <a href="http://www.video.ru/"><img title="Video.ru - our answer IMDB" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/db8/1f2/2dd/db81f22ddb7d58ca9a52beeffc852452.jpg" width="198" height="56"></a> <br><h3>  <a href="http://www.video.ru/">www.video.ru</a> </h3><br>  Video.ru, as their presentation video clip said, is the largest video portal in the history of Runet.  The project was conceived as “Our answer IMDB”, however, in terms of the size of the base, it is significantly inferior to its main competitor in this niche - “Film Search”.  It is also worth noting that the design of the new portal is not vebdvololny that has recently become the hallmark of almost any startup. <br><br>  <strong>Sergey Aksenov (Founder of film.ru):</strong> <em>“Over the past few years, there have been several ambitious attempts to create websites devoted to cinema, designed to remove all competitors and become number one.</em>  <em>So far, none of them have been crowned with success, and some have shamefully failed.</em>  <em>Personally, I am glad that the young punks, who set themselves serious goals, are not being transferred here, and I will be watching with interest the new undertaking. ”</em> <br><br> <a href="http://www.monamur.ru/"><img title="monamur" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b61/d94/108/b61d94108987955fb131caf238178597.jpg" width="219" height="80"></a> <br><h3>  <a href="http://www.monamour.ru/">www.monamour.ru</a> </h3><br>  MonAmur is a new dating service from Mamba.  As stated by the ex-president of “Mamba” (and now steering Odnoklassniki) - Nikita Sherman is the agency for finding the ideal partners.  The main feature of the new service is that it is looking for partners on the basis of psychological tests, which means it promises to be more relevant.  The service is designed for an older audience than the traditional dating from mamba. <br><br>  <strong>Nikita Sherman (Ex-President of “Mamba”):</strong> <em>“Mon Amour” is an independent project, not a service, section or service of the “Mamba” system. Therefore, two projects have two different business models.</em>  <em>Mon Amour is a prepaid service (with a monthly subscription fee), and Mamba is a free resource with a set of paid services.</em>  <em>Mon Amour has its own website which is not affiliated with Mamba.</em>  <em>We believe that the market is ripe for the emergence of such models, although we understand that this form of payment is unusual for Russian users.</em>  <em>It is clear that the mass consumer is closer to the “Mamba” model, but still “Mon Amour” is the product that you buy, for which you give your money.</em>  <em>Now we are focusing on the development of this project, its introduction to the market and the improvement of the quality of services, so we are not ready to talk about any specific figures, both in terms of the number of users and profitability.</em>  <em>In the future, we would be satisfied with the figure of 100,000 people.</em>  <em>So, we can earn $ 1 million a month. ”</em> <br><br><h1>  Habraps </h1><br><br> <a href="http://www.socialwatch.ru/"><img title="SocialWatch - Asocial network." src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/332/75d/df1/33275ddf12e3b5103942b150111119ea.jpg" width="350" height="49"></a> <br><h3>  <a href="http://www.socialwatch.ru/">www.Socialwatch.ru</a> </h3><br>  SocialWatch is an antisocial service designed to spy on people who are registered on social networks.  With it, you can find out when people you are interested in have visited this or that social network.  Already, the service is spying on all the largest social networks and dating services. <br><br>  <strong>Alexander Sergeev (Founder of the project):</strong> <em>“SocialWatch.ru is a tool for monitoring the activity of users of social networks.</em>  <em>It can show you what time users appeared on sites.</em>  <em>If you are a manager, the service will help you control your subordinates.</em>  <em>Add links to the profiles of your employees in social networks, and get a daily report of who visited the sites and when.</em>  <em>Even if employees visit a site not from a work computer, I use anonymizers, or in collusion with system administrators, you still know the facts of their stay on sites. ”</em> <br><br> <a href="http://www.wipmania.com/"><img title="Wipmania - geolocation service" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b54/f04/6c5/b54f046c5947d357118fb95be664198b.jpg" width="350" height="71"></a> <br><h3>  <a href="http://www.wipmania.com/ru">www.wipmania.com/ru</a> </h3><br>  Wipmania is a free geolocation service.  With it, you can quite accurately locate any computer or mobile device connected to the network. <br><br>  <strong>Alrond (Developer):</strong> <em>“The main difference between WorldIP and all other geolocation services is that it provides real physical locations of networks, not their owners (as represented by whois, on whose data all other bases are based).</em>  <em>This is the most correct information, one of the simplest examples of this: large providers that distribute IP addresses in different regions.</em>  <em>Using targeting in its, say, Japanese resource, it is more expedient to offer relevant advertising, language, products ... specifically to the target Japanese visitor, rather than the American provider. ”</em> <br><br> <a href="http://www.elebom.com/"><img title="Elebom - music search engine" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/444/b78/c14/444b78c14c7668a194ff444e648faa5a.jpg" width="184" height="46"></a> <br><h3>  <a href="http://www.elebom.com/">www.elebom.com</a> </h3><br>  Elebom is a music search system.  With it, you can find and download songs of interest to you from some of the open databases of the Runet (first of all, on the Vkontakte database).  In addition, there is a sorting of compositions of one or another author by popularity. <br><br>  <strong>Unikum (Founder of the project):</strong> <em>“From the age of 14 I tried to create websites on the Internet, but it didn’t work very well, a couple of years have passed since then and recently I had the idea to create my own search engine.</em>  <em>Then I began to learn PHP and gradually bring the idea to life.</em>  <em>For all the time, a lot of different music search engines were shown in Habré, but I decided to go my own way and reinvent the wheel. ”</em> <br><br> <a href="http://www.turumpurum.ru/"><img title="TurumPurum - a musical social network" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/35c/b54/736/35cb547362bd47a0114f5f73da706eee.jpg" width="350" height="108"></a> <br><h3>  <a href="http://www.turumpurum.ru/">www.turumpurum.ru</a> </h3><br>  TurumPurum - This is a musical social network.  Although, as it seemed to me, this is primarily a system of collective blogs.  A sort of musical Habr.  Of the features - a unique user rating system. <br><br>  <strong>Kirill Ivaschenko (Founder of the project):</strong> <em>“As such, there was no initial idea - there was a desire to make a project of musical themes.</em>  <em>For several months this thought was spinning in my head, then I realized that I needed to act.</em>  <em>The point is to collect music lovers and various music performers on one site - thus, to collect the maximum quality content in one convenient place for users, where everyone can freely receive and discuss it.</em>  <em>There were no projects of this type in RuNet - or rather, there were weak similarities, and even those made only for some group or “branch”.</em> <br><br> <a href="http://www.rsser.ru/"><img title="Rsser - social rss reader" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/8b7/02b/c9b/8b702bc9b4c65afd411afcca591635c3.jpg" width="240" height="130"></a> <br><h3>  <a href="http://www.rsser.ru/">www.rsser.ru</a> </h3><br>  Rsser is a new social reader.  The reader is quite functional, and has many useful features, for example, to approve your favorite posts, which will later appear on the main page. <br><br>  <strong>Dmitry Baibekov (Founder of the project):</strong> <em>“What makes RSSer better than other RSS readers?</em> <em><br></em>  <em>All entries from the RSS feeds are viewed by many people who filter them by rating them, adding to the bookmarks and commenting on the entries, thereby selecting the most interesting ones.</em>  <em>It was decided to refuse the conclusion of the full text of the post, because not all bloggers would agree with that. ”</em> <br><br><h1>  Lightweight </h1><br><br> <a href="http://www.vpodzemke.ru/"><img title="Vpodzemke - Underground Social Network" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/948/2cc/282/9482cc282e86de918ec789053d147299.jpg" width="204" height="48"></a> <br><h3>  <a href="http://www.vpodzemke.ru/">www.vpodzemke.ru</a> </h3><br>  "In the subway" - an underground social network designed to brighten up your daily ride in the subway.  You add a station from where you are going and your usual routes, and the system finds people who drive in similar ways, and you can find out what your usual companions breathe and think about. <br><br>  <strong>From the blog of developers:</strong> <em>“What we want: turn a trip on the subway into an exciting journey, so that everyone can create a friendly communication environment for themselves.</em> <em><br></em>  <em>How it works: you mark your home station and familiar routes on the metro map.</em>  <em>The service finds people whose routes coincide with yours.</em>  <em>Perhaps you will meet familiar faces.</em>  <em>You can find out what your fellow travelers are reading and listening to, what they are interested in, see the photos. ”</em> <br><br> <a href="http://www.automobile.ru/"><img title="Automobile - car ad service" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/aa5/fbc/20e/aa5fbc20e95081bf301562117fd48f2e.jpg" width="192" height="33"></a> <br><h3>  <a href="http://www.automobile.ru/">www.automobile.ru</a> </h3><br>  Avtomobile.Ru is a project launched by Onis.  A project with serious ambitsy.  At its core, this is an ad service equipped with many innovative features.  Some of them are, for example, a unique rating system based on morphological and syntactic analysis. <br><br>  <strong>From the press release:</strong> <em>“The user’s services: the largest database of advertisements with more than 600,000 positions, search results with photos, the ability to refine the search query, advanced personal account features.</em> <em><br></em>  <em>The full version of the portal announces an expanded set of sections and functions: adding favorite ads to favorites and comparing them, subscribing to a search query, sending instant messages to the author of any favorite advertisement, and much more. ”</em> <br><br> <a href="http://www.vselisdelal.ru/"><img title="Vselisdelal - reminder service" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/8ba/4f1/c1d/8ba4f1c1dccfcb99558db21c67a82337.jpg" width="273" height="42"></a> <br><h3>  <a href="http://www.vselisdelal.ru/">www.vselisdelal.ru</a> </h3><br>  “Has Everything Done?” Allows us not to forget what we wanted and want to do.  To do this, you need to register in the system, and enter your real phone number there.  After that, you can call a special phone number anywhere and say, for example, “Do not forget to lower the karma to the troll on Habré,” and you will receive a voice message with a corresponding notification in the mail. <br><br>  <strong>Roman Medvedev (Project Manager):</strong> <em>“Our solution is a convenient way to create“ cases ”and reminders with a simple call from a mobile phone.</em>  <em>There are many situations (when you are driving, on the road, etc.) in which it is very inconvenient to use ordinary means of recording (organizer, notebook, mobile phone).</em>  <em>In such cases, it is faster to call and say, than to look for an opportunity to make yourself a mark somewhere.</em>  <em>In the near future, we plan to launch a free 8-800 number for phone calls.</em>  <em>Paid features of the service are not yet provided. "</em> <br><br> <a href="http://www.wwjd.ru/"><img title="wwjd - Christian search engine." src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e33/1d3/a47/e331d3a476295d12bc8a93a9f4246a2d.jpg" width="203" height="79"></a> <br><h3>  <a href="http://www.wwjd.ru/">www.wwjd.ru</a> </h3><br>  Wwjd means “What Would Jesus Do?” (“What would Jesus do?”) And this is the first Christian search engine in Russia, and maybe in the world.  Here you will find a unique general Christian search engine, a set of seo-services for Christian webmasters, and even a Christian Internet television. <br><br>  <strong>Andrei Grachev (Project Owner):</strong> <em>“The resource is designed for Russian-speaking Internet users.</em>  <em>I think that Russian-speaking Christians around the world will appreciate the convenience of a new search engine.</em>  <em>In the English version I do not see the need yet, but the search forms in Ukrainian and Belarusian will be available in the national domain zones - wwjd.org.ua and wwjd.by.</em> <em><br></em>  <em>I want to clarify right away: WWJD.RU will not be a business project.</em>  <em>This project is, above all, ideological, and will remain so.</em>  <em>However, it is still necessary to recoup the costs, therefore, advertising on the main page may appear soon enough, and in the future the appearance of paid services, the launch of which is possible in 2010, is also likely. ”</em> <br><br> <a href="http://www.familyspace.ru/"><img title="FamilySpace - social network for relatives" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/5b4/e72/2a1/5b4e722a1667e81fd56f16bef271cc16.jpg" width="350" height="59"></a> <br><h3>  <a href="http://www.familyspace.ru/">www.FamilySpace.ru</a> </h3><br>  Family Space is a social network for relatives.  Its creators believe that by changing time for money, we get tired of meetings, forget dates, and confuse names.  To prevent this from happening again, they offer you to gather your whole large family in your service, and often pay attention to each other. <br><br>  <strong>Maxim Korneev (PR director of the project):</strong> <em>“Numerous sociological studies of recent years show the revival of family values ​​in Russia, their transformation into the dominant life of the modern average Russian.</em>  <em>At the same time, interest is returning to the history of his family, maintaining ties with relatives, and expanding the circle of friends.</em>  <em>These trends prompted the founders of FamilySpace.Ru, working in the field of professional investments and consulting, to create the first family social network in Russia.</em>  <em>According to the initiators of the project, by the end of the first year of the existence of FamilySpace.Ru they expect to attract to the network at least one and a half million users who will actively participate in the life of this new community.</em>  <em>For the same period of time, up to 500 thousand dollars will be invested in technical support and marketing support of the project. ”</em> <br><br><h1>  People's Choice Award </h1><br><br> <a href="http://www.apokalypsis.ru/"><img title="Apokalipsis - a project for practical God-likeness" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b3d/6dc/aed/b3d6dcaeda326607103e4574eb06d29b.jpg" width="295" height="50"></a> <br><h3>  <a href="http://www.apokalypsis.ru/">www.apokalypsis.ru</a> </h3><br>  The Apocalypse project is intended to “warn modern interpreters against naive, biased and arbitrary interpretations.” The visitors to this resource will be able to fully familiarize themselves with Christian teachings and take the path of practical God-knowledge. <br><br>  <strong>The authors of the Apocalypse:</strong> <em>“The interpretation of the Apocalypse is part of Orthodox theology.</em>  <em>Orthodox theology is grace, its foundation is the purification of passions and the enlightenment of the Holy Spirit.</em>  <em>At the same time, it implies extensive knowledge of the Christian teaching that the Holy Fathers possessed.</em>  <em>Therefore, any Christian who wants to understand the Apocalypse correctly should become familiar with the interpretations of the Holy Fathers, have deep (correct) ideas about Christianity in general, and be in a spiritual feat.</em>  <em>The name of the site was chosen by us not by chance.</em>  <em>The word Apocalypse expresses the essence of Christian eschatology.</em>  <em>It is used by us to emphasize the basis of Orthodox ideas about the completion of human history in Divine knowledge, and not in human speculation and conjecture. ”</em> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/40914/">https://habr.com/ru/post/40914/</a></p>
