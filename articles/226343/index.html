Why, when we grow up, someone decides for us that there is no place for games in our life ?!  After all, more and more ‚Äúno longer children‚Äù prefer to spend their free time playing all sorts of games: the mafia, the crocodile, poker, chess and other board games are again gaining popularity in modern society.  Why not bring the element of the game into the process of interaction with employees and customers, which will increase loyalty to the company, both from outside and from outside.

    <h5>  Purpose of gamification </h5><br>  The goal of gamification is to make the traditional traditional platform more interesting by adding game elements to it, of which there are a huge number and which can be used in the process of creating a website or application, for example: achievements, hidden bonuses, competition, progress, quest or leaderboard. <br><br>  A variety of actions and rewards are the basis, a kind of "building blocks", gamification of a website or application.  Providing users with various awards (bonuses, virtual points or money, stars) motivates them to actively engage in the process of working on the site and guarantees a return. <br><br>  Gamification, however, is not the only way to make your website or application completely successful.  Without a doubt, its application will introduce many new details into the design and help solve functional problems and problems.  It must be remembered that proper development and implementation will affect the loyalty of users and their involvement in the process. <br><br><h5>  Marketing activity and game mechanics </h5><br>  Game mechanics are actively used in marketing activities.  The technologies that are available today make it possible to implement both simple elements of gamification (loyalty programs) and complex ones (interactive products). <br><br>  To achieve your business goals, you can use one of the 10 game mechanics below, or any combination of these methods. <br><br><ol><li>  <b>Fast feedback: fast feedback or response to actions</b> <br>  Invite users to continue using the site (in the app), make any changes, or return to the site using on-screen notification, a text message, or an email.  You can also congratulate the user on achieving a goal, encourage him to take the next step, or upgrade. </li><li>  <b>Transparency: the position of each user</b> <br>  You must create a convenient system, according to which each user will understand his progress in real time.  A general ranking showing the leaders and the users following him will also encourage users to take more active actions on the site or in the application. </li><li>  <b>Goals: achieving short-term and long-term goals</b> <br>  Set global and local tasks for users, their solution is always associated with gaining new experience. </li><li>  <b>Promotions: proof of achievement</b> <br>  It is necessary to ensure constant reinforcement of progress, both monetary and emotional (bonuses, points, stars).  The desire to get a new promotion will be an incentive for action on the site and guarantees a return. </li><li>  <b>Levels: raise or lower user status</b> <br>  Levels depend on fulfilling long-term and short-term goals.  They are used to identify the position of the user on the site or in the application.  With unlocking each new level, the user receives new quests or missions, rewards and rewards, i.e.  logical development of the level of complexity. </li><li>  <b>Training: an introduction to the case</b> <br>  Video tutorials will tell you how to work with a site or application - each user learns from a specific example, and not through trial and error.  Simple tasks will help new users to immediately join the process of the ‚Äúgame‚Äù on the site.  Mastering simple missions, they will use a clear guide to work in a previously unknown interface. </li><li>  <b>Competition Element: Comparison with Other Users</b> <br>  Tables or graphs that demonstrate the user's position relative to others always encourage users to take more active actions.  Encourage competition between them.  Your users should ask themselves questions: How to break the lead?  How to overtake the closest competitors?  How to get more bonuses? </li><li>  <b>Collaboration: Achieving the Goal by Collaborating with Other Users</b> <br>  Stimulate users to team up to perform complex tasks and get big rewards and bonuses.  Each team member must understand their contribution to the common cause. </li><li>  <b>Community: social activity</b> <br>  Community and participation in it gives meaning to goals, promotions, competitions and other mechanics.  Users can share experiences and knowledge on how best to perform a particular task, explain the benefits of bonuses and incentives, talk about the benefits of the transition to a new level.  Such communication stimulates the growth of new users and more active involvement of old ones. </li><li>  <b>Points: Real Evidence of Achievement</b> <br>  Gaining experience, increasing status and accumulating bonuses - all this allows users to purchase virtual and real goods with substantial discounts or receive them as a gift.  All points earned can be exchanged or spent, get exactly what the user did all the tasks and improved his level. </li></ol><br><br>  All these mechanics can be used both in relation to users, and within the company, in relation to employees.  The involvement of employees in the gameplay will increase their professionalism and allow them to ‚Äúpump‚Äù their skills in their careers. <br><br>  We can safely say that gamification transforms traditional business models, creates new ways of expanding business, manages the loyalty of users and employees.  Gamification works !!!  It uses the real motives and desires inherent in each of us, providing bonuses and rewards, for which we are ready to make a little effort.  Given the latest research on motivating people, generating them into the principles of interaction with users and employees, gamification gives companies the ability to create and maintain true loyalty. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/226343/">https://habr.com/ru/post/226343/</a></p>
