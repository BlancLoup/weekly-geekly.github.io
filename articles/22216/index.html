Voting.</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Many are already aware that the Tagline rating has moved to the second phase - voting.  I honestly strongly surprised, if not to say upset.  But first, let's go back to the recent past. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/de5/ffb/d23/de5ffbd23e7b7d23c4ef3449970b58f6.gif"><br><br>  As far as I know, it all started in June 2006.  One bright head, pretending to be a customer, called around to all the market leaders asking them to make a typical website.  As a result, the obtained information was published as ‚Äú <a href="http://www.adme.ru/adnews/2006/06/29/7130.html">Rating of TOP-30 web studios of RuNet by the cost of developing the site</a> ‚Äù.  Maybe this approach is not entirely ethical ... nevertheless, it was a real breakthrough, everyone finally found out how much the development of the site in <a href="http://www.artlebedev.ru/">the Lebedev Studio</a> was :). <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The following year, <a href="http://2007.tagline.ru/">TagLine</a> launched its first rating.  310 studios are pre-registered.  Then all the work on the formation of the rating fell on the shoulders of independent experts and organizers of the rating ... The representative of the studio had to go through a simple registration, and if there was a desire, speak out about the market situation, trends, etc.  The most interesting opinions and comments after verification were published on the site.  I will not comment on how adequate the top turned out, after all, the task itself is a very difficult and complex one, and as far as I understand there was no experience at all. <br><br>  As far as I understand, this year the organizers and experts decided to make them ‚Äúwork out‚Äù all the participants in the rating ‚Äúin full‚Äù.  On the other hand, ‚Äúmaster-barin‚Äù, you want to get into the top and bend it wrong ...

      Now the vote consists of six steps, each of which is mandatory.  First, all participants (610 people passed preliminary registration) are asked about the general situation in the market.  Here are the questions (all fields are required): <br><ol><li>  Briefly describe the current situation on the market.  Describe the main problems in the market for both players and customers. </li><li>  Market size.  Considered the volume of the market creation, support and development of sites for professional companies operating on the market (freelancers are not counted) in RuNet over the past year. </li><li>  The number of players.  Specify the number of professional web studios currently active in the market. </li><li>  Describe the main trends / trends of the market in the future. </li></ol><br>  Maybe I have some opinions on the trends and problems in the market, however, I would like to decide for myself whether to voice it or not. <br><br>  Or tell me where I am from, the owner of a <a href="http://www.kulish.ru/">small regional studio</a> , can I know about the volume of the web design market in Russia ?!  Or is it a lottery, for those who guess - a special prize?  After all, I do not work in the tax or there the audit chamber ... <br><br>  I don‚Äôt know about you, but I‚Äôm even insane, I‚Äôm unlikely to have an idea to count all the professional teams, so most likely I will choose the number from the bald.  Understand the analyst is not my profession, we do sites!  More interesting. <br><br>  At the second stage, I propose to make the top 10 studios in terms of turnover!  With all due respect to the organizers: I have no idea who earns so much, although I don‚Äôt lie, I‚Äôm just imagining the pace of several studios in Rostov.  Since the stage is obligatory, I first put ‚Äú <a href="http://www.artlebedev.ru/">Lebedev Studio</a> ‚Äù, the rest at random - let people be pleased. <br><br>  Go to the third step.  Top 10 studios in terms of fame.  Here I have big doubts ... maybe it‚Äôs right to build a rating based on brand awareness, but in my opinion, this is somehow more for glossy magazines ... there‚Äôs a conflict in the soul: after all, fame is not always equal to quality. <br><br>  It is not at all clear why you first need to make a list of ten studios, and then arrange the asterisks points from 1 to 10 ... The interface to the word is creepy and it slows down incredibly ... But this is a completely different topic ... <br><br>  Back to our rating, ‚Äústep four, five and six‚Äù information about the company, work and technology, this is probably the only thing that really needs to be left. <br><br>  In general, what am I doing all this ... Honestly, I did not want to offend anyone ... It just seems to me that in the pursuit of credibility and popularization of the rating, they again forgot about the meaning: (. <br><br>  PS Somehow it was too emotional, sorry ... probably waited too long: (. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/22216/">https://habr.com/ru/post/22216/</a></p>
