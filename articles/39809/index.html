  <section class="page js-page"><h1>10 reasons why you should not quit your job and become a freelancer</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Nowadays, more and more people are leaving the company and settling in home offices.  Quite often they ask me a question: is it worth it to quit and start earning a living in freelancer?  An unequivocal answer, of course, will not give anyone.  Someone is able to independently communicate with customers, update the task list and not break the deadlines.  Someone, on the contrary, can work productively only under conditions of control by the management.  Let's try to find the benefits of working in the office. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br><ol><li>  <b>Guarantees</b> <br>  An officially employed employee has a minimum fixed monthly salary, which he is guaranteed to receive in the accounting department at the end of the month.  Attracting customers and providing you with work is a company problem.  The attentive reader will think about the word ‚Äúsalary‚Äù and rightly object: ‚ÄúIsn‚Äôt it why I‚Äôm going to set sail for free swimming in order to earn at least as much as in the office?‚Äù  Quite right, many people write a statement ‚Äúof their own will,‚Äù including for the sake of raising income.  But in order to ensure that you receive your remuneration for the eight-hour working day in a timely manner, at least the director and accountant work in the organization.  On ‚Äúfree breads‚Äù the amount of income and its stability are often unpredictable things. <br>  Do not forget about paid vacation and contributions to the pension fund.  I heard a lot of talk about the fact that some freelancers pay taxes and make contributions to the pension fund.  I admit honestly - I have never met such people in person. <br>  At the time of the decision to dismiss, we already see ourselves in the near future as a successful and wealthy owner of our own business (are you not going to draw sites to a great old age?), Who can independently save at least a couple of millions by the sixtieth anniversary.  I respect your ambitions, but you should never lose sight of the fact that events sometimes tend not to unfold the way we want. <br>  Before you put a statement on the table, you should also think about who will pay for your sick leave. </li><li>  <b>Allow yourself this here and now</b> <br>  Each of us had moments in life when money was needed a lot now, but there would be little the day after.  Whether it's buying a car or repairing an apartment - for many of us, a few hundred thousand rubles are an impressive amount.  What will an office worker do?  Go to the bank, write a statement and a week later come to work at the new "Toyota". <br>  What will a freelancer do?  That's right - try to borrow from friends or relatives.  They, by the way, may well not be the required amount. <br>  There is an opinion that it is easier to get a loan from a bank without formal employment.  I suggest checking the most meticulous of my readers - try to borrow a hundred or two hundred thousand from a bank. </li><li>  <b>An employee of the company can work with large customers.</b> <br>  I sincerely wish you to succeed and fulfill orders for famous Russian and foreign brands.  But, you see, you need to try hard and have an impressive portfolio, so that the guys from Microsoft instructed the ‚Äúfree artist‚Äù to create a design for the promotional website. <br>  ‚ÄúBut the works that I performed while working at company N are the property of company N!‚Äù, The reader will argue.  Of course.  But nothing prevents you from claiming that the work for such and such a client was done by you as part of your N. </li><li>  <b>By itself, work in a large company is a good line in the record.</b> <br>  Since you are reading these lines, sooner or later you will quit.  I hope none of you will argue that the mark in his biography about his position at a large agency increases the chances of getting a client. </li><li>  <b>Discipline and timing control</b> <br>  I am familiar with many talented people who show excellent professional results.  But only in those cases when there is someone who can clearly formulate the task, set deadlines and monitor the execution.  If you do not have the minimum managerial skills, need a link between you and the client, have difficulty organizing your own time and are used to being reminded of the deadlines - it is worthwhile to wait with dismissal and work on these skills. </li><li>  <b>Teamwork experience</b> <br>  None of the freelancers do not want to draw layouts and write articles, sitting in four walls, to a great age.  I think I will be objective if I say that the perspective goal of any independent specialist - the creation and development of their own business (big or small - does not matter).  The ability to delegate tasks, listen to the advice of colleagues and adequately respond to criticism - these are the things that will definitely be useful to you in the future.  You are lucky, you work in the office - use this chance and acquire the necessary skills. </li><li>  <b>Training at the expense of colleagues</b> <br>  Working in a team, you have a great opportunity to improve at the expense of colleagues.  Surely in your company there are people with skills that you do not have.  Ask questions, get answers, grow professionally.  And all this is completely free. </li><li>  <b>Fixed work schedule</b> <br>  Working in an office of eight hours five days a week is not a bad idea.  A fixed schedule allows you to plan your free time.  If your work day usually ends at 7:00 pm, you can shamelessly arrange a meeting with friends next week on Thursday at 7:30 pm. <br>  Still want to gain independence and work independently?  Get ready for the fact that the friendly crowd will have to be postponed, and the premiere sequel about Agent 007 will be abandoned in favor of working on an urgent project. </li><li>  <b>Social life</b> <br>  Having decided to gain independence from the employer, get ready for the fact that one day email and icq will replace your live communication.  In psychology, it is commonly called social deprivation, which, by the way, can lead to serious psychological deformations of the individual.  Talking about weather with a colleague in a smoking room only at first glance may seem to be a useless exercise.  I bet - after some time you will start to miss this useless chatter. </li><li>  <b>Your professional reputation is protected by the company.</b> <br>  Imagine that the agency you work for has lost a client.  Even worse, if the refusal to cooperate occurred through your own fault (failure to meet deadlines or poor quality results).  Not a very pleasant situation, right?  But even from it you can extract a positive experience - the client refused to work with the company, but not with you.  It protects your professional reputation at the expense of the company.  The worst thing that could threaten - the dismissal.  But you yourself were going to do it? </li></ol><br><br>  If you want to ply, please <a href="https://megamozg.ru/users/alexeyenko/" class="user_link">alexeyenko</a> - I just posted his topic here on my own initiative, he does not have enough karma. </div>
