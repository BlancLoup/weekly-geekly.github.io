  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Gartner analysts include HP among the ‚Äúvisionaries‚Äù in their ‚ÄúMagic Quadrant‚Äù on data center network infrastructure</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  In recent years, requirements for data center network infrastructure have begun to change rapidly.  Vendors are trying to provide customers with flexible network solutions with advanced management features that help reduce costs, but the most important criterion remains the reliability of the network infrastructure of the data processing center. <br><br> <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/hp/blog/264461/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/1a6/a24/e1f/1a6a24e1f25644e1bd7fecd0ade5b1ab.jpg"></a> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  <font color="#0096d6">Data Center Networks</font> </h2><br>  Today, when implementing the network infrastructure of the data center, it is required to simplify network operations, link them with business objectives, increase the flexibility of the data center due to network programmability and automation.  The network must adapt to changing the scale of the data center, the density of equipment in the data center and the nature of the loads.  To ensure equipment compatibility, reduce vendor dependency, and simplify innovation, network solutions must be built on open standards. <br><br>  Networks of modern data centers should ensure the creation of a simplified and automated network architecture.  Increased application requirements for bandwidth, network latency.  To meet the new requirements, one- and two-level switching architectures are implemented, and intelligent functions at the access level are used.  This helps to improve the performance of inter-server traffic exchange and provide a uniform set of functions to all connected computing resources.

      The demand for data transfer speeds is also changing, although in most data centers there is still no demand for 25GbE, 40GbE or 50GbE at the level of access to servers or 100GbE at the core of the network.  Currently, in most data centers, 10 Gigabit Ethernet (10GbE) at the edge of the network is enough to connect servers and 40GbE in the network core.  Ethernet fabs are gaining popularity - single- or two-layer switching infrastructures. <br><br>  Thanks to simplified operations, accelerated IT resource allocation and rapid deployment, converged infrastructure, reference architectures, and integrated systems have become popular.  According to Gartner, last year the share of convergent solutions in the global market for infrastructure solutions for the data center was 7% - 57% more than a year earlier. <br><br>  When evaluating vendors' offers, customers should pay special attention to ‚Äúsoftware-oriented‚Äù approaches, according to Gartner analysts.  In addition, most vendors of network equipment for data centers use commercially available chips in their products, and the differences between their solutions are shifted to the software level, which also emphasizes the special role of software. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0096d6">SDN</font> </h2><br>  According to Gartner, the number of SDN-based data center implementations in 2014 was three times higher than in the previous year.  2014 was the year of practical implementation of software-configured networks (SDN).  This approach has such advantages as the rapid deployment of the required resources for workloads, as well as enhanced security and advanced management.  Among the economic benefits - reducing the cost of network equipment and software, reducing operating costs and reducing dependence on the vendor. <br><br>  Sometimes, SDN functions are implemented using so-called overlays ‚Äî virtual networks deployed over physical networks.  Reliable overlaying solutions require efficient management tools that ensure the transparency of the network infrastructure. <br><br>  Today, the feasibility of long-term investments in solutions that do not support SDN is being questioned.  Many participants in the Gartner study are members of the OpenDaylight consortium, and some have released SDD products based on OpenDaylight. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0096d6">Magic quadrant</font> </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/82e/bd0/3d3/82ebd03d313545ebbf1599472b89ae38.png"><br><br>  <i><font color="#999999">Magic quadrant for data center network infrastructure.</font></i>  <i><font color="#999999">Source: Gartner (May 2015)</font></i> <i><font color="#999999"><br></font></i> <br>  HP ranks second among the leading players in the global data center network infrastructure market.  It is distinguished by its presence in many geographic regions, a wide range of chassis, modular and fixed-configuration switches capable of satisfying the needs of almost any organization.  HP is an active supporter of open SDN-based and disaggregated switching architectures.  The company provides comprehensive support for devices and controllers through the online catalog SDN App Store. <br><br>  The HP SDN App Store online catalog helps to bring to the market numerous innovative solutions in the field of software-configured networks, provides HP partners with a platform for building relationships with customers, and also provides access to consulting and technical support services.  As the industry's first enterprise-class SDN application ecosystem, the HP SDN App Store is changing the networking industry's business model, providing developers with a centralized platform to connect with customers around the world.  Customers were able to find, study and acquire network applications and download them for testing and deployment. <br><br>  According to Gartner analysts, HP should be seen as a potential vendor when implementing any network solutions for data centers, especially if these solutions are standards-based or open. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0096d6">Strengths</font> </h2><br>  HP implements a very broad and standards-based approach that meets the full range of customer requirements.  This is confirmed by other Gartner studies, where HP is called the ‚Äúmost open‚Äù vendor of the network solution providers listed in this study. <br><br>  HP Comware software provides support for advanced Layer 3, FCoE, factories, and SDN environments at one standard price and can be applied to the entire range of company network products. <br><br>  HP offers a complete converged infrastructure, including network hardware and software, servers and storage systems, as well as the HP OneView management system. <br><br>  With its own SDN controller, released in May 2015, HP supports the OpenDaylight environment, which is becoming increasingly reliable and scalable, implements this support in the SDN App Store, offering solutions based on OpenDaylight. <br><br>  However, numerous SDN usage scenarios, including Helion OpenStack with Virtual Cloud Networking, VMware NSX, and HP Distributed Cloud Networking (DCN based on Nuage Networks, part of Alcatel-Lucent) and HP Networking Virtual Application Networks (VAN) solutions, can disorient customers . <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0096d6">Quadrant inclusion criteria</font> </h2><br>  The vendor is evaluated for the entire portfolio of products and services, including the ability to build complete infrastructure solutions - Ethernet factory architectures, switches of various levels and classes, SDN controllers and applications, management tools and orchestration.  Migration strategies, virtualization support, and scalability issues are also taken into account.  Special attention is paid to open environments, including disaggregation and SDN.  It also assesses the overall financial condition of the vendor, the likelihood of continued investment in products and the expansion of the solution portfolio, the market strategy of the vendor and its partners, interaction with potential customers and the ability to offer the best solution. <br><br>  In addition, the vendor‚Äôs ability to respond to the market situation, change strategy in accordance with customer needs and market dynamics, as well as the influence of the vendor on the market in terms of key trends, is taken into account. <br><br>  A vendor must have a full vision - understand the future market conditions and be ready for them, foresee the future and implement new ideas in their plans and products.  Market leaders are trying to make data center networks more flexible, open, relevant to changing application architectures, offer customers choices and ensure investment protection.  Relevant strategies are based on open networks, disaggregation, SDN, and other latest architectural approaches. <br><br>  The vendor's investments in research and development for key innovations, including plans for open networks, disaggregation, SDN and other newest architectural approaches, the ability to promote innovations to meet new requirements for the data center network infrastructure, and the vendor's investments in new technologies are taken into account. business and market development.  A key factor in data center networks is vendor innovation in technology areas that best meet the needs of the market. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0096d6">Quadrant description</font> </h2><br>  Leaders demonstrate willingness to meet the changing requirements of the architecture of a large number of data centers, have the ability to shape the market, maintain strong ties with trading partners and customers. <br><br>  Applicants demonstrate stable operation in the market, have a clear strategy, but do not form a market. <br><br>  Seers (to whom analysts attributed HP) demonstrate the ability to increase the functionality of their proposals, offering the market a unique approach that distinguishes their products from competitors.  Seers are characterized by innovations in one or more key areas of the data center network infrastructure, such as management, security, operational efficiency, and cost reduction. <br><br>  Niche players offer a wide range of products, but do not have strong opportunities to promote them.  Niche players offer competitive products and in some of these offers may be the best choice. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/264461/">https://habr.com/ru/post/264461/</a></p>
