By school education, I mean one in which the student's progress must somehow be monitored.  As examples will be considered: <br>  ‚óè <a href="http://khanacademy.org/">khanacademy.org A</a> giant in the industry. <br>  ‚óè <a href="http://eftsh.ru/">eftsh.ru</a> Electronic FTSH, project at MIPT. <br>  ‚óè <a href="http://100ege.ru/">100ege.ru</a> Portal on preparation for university olympiads, EGE and GIA. <br>  ‚óè <a href="http://interneturok.ru/">interneturok.ru</a> and <a href="http://univertv.ru/">univertv.ru</a> are the lecture archives, but at the moment there is no interaction with the student. <br>  ‚óè <a href="http://dnevnik.ru/">dnevnik.ru</a> All-Russian free school educational network. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <i>After the publication of the first two articles, many people turned to me.</i>  <i>I apologize to those whom I do not answer for a long time, there are really a lot of letters, and I do not want to write a formal reply.</i> <i><br></i> <br>  I received a lot of messages from private people willing to participate in the creation of something big and useful.  It's great!  In addition, representatives of <a href="http://eftsh.ru/">eftsh.ru</a> and <a href="http://dnevnik.ru/">dnevnik.ru</a> contacted me.  The latter even showed me their office in St. Petersburg and gave them their own eyes to make sure that more than 100 people were on staff. <br><br><h4>  Content </h4><br>  Let's start with the picture, which consists of shots from lessons / lectures on the same topic - the weight on the spring.  The order of the location does not cover any meaning. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/01f/773/035/01f773035f16fdb3d4bc10366f2386bc.jpg">

There and an example from life (a leaf spring of the truck :)), and additional physics for advanced (phase space).  The only thing is that it is morally obsolete (again, because of the example of the spring).  I am tormented by the philosophical question - if you watch this video on the latest iPad model, will it still be morally obsolete or not? <br><br>  What I wanted to say by this.  Video collections of all stripes  Especially on the basic program.  The question is - do we consider ourselves elected to make the lesson about the weight on the spring better than anyone else?  To answer this question, you must first understand the power of the Khan Academy.  It would seem that of the above examples, his video is the poorest.  But its advantage is that Khan, in a single style, made lessons about everything, and a student can go through most of the subject without thinking about joining lecture courses.  This is how it is customary in our schools to use a textbook of the same author (or at least a publication) throughout the entire educational process, since then the material is self-consistent.  Often in institutions this is no longer.  Returning to the question of whether we can do the lesson better than anyone else, the answer is that the lesson‚Äôs ‚Äúgoodness‚Äù lies not only in itself, but also in the material surrounding it, so we must speak immediately about creating lecture courses, which is a completely different amount of work. . <br><br>  Also this kind of clips illustrates how many ways one can read the same material.  If at that Hindu university many examples are solved numerically (as they train engineers, apparently), then at 100ege.ru they show the solution of difur and solve analytically many variations.  The question, of course, is what to teach in school.  Since Soviet times, we have remained the concept of complete unification of all educational programs in the country.  It seems to me that this is correct when the basic set of knowledge is decided centrally by the experts, and not by each educational institution independently. <br><br>  We come to the next question.  Who decides what is included in the ‚Äúset of gentlemen‚Äù and what is not?  The average teacher of the old school has accumulated a lot of notes for lessons in 20-30 years of work at the school.  Can we take them as a basis?  Most likely not, since his colleague in the next school will have an absolutely opposite point of view.  Maybe do everything from scratch?  Then, to compile a modern course, you need an active scientist in this field, to create a digestible course, you need an experienced teacher, to read a lecture you need an actor, as well as a director, etc.  etc ... In general, a lot of people, if you want to make a step towards improving the quality of educational material.  Otherwise, everything is ready. <br><br>  Selection of a team to create a course is also very difficult.  Many Soviet school textbooks were written by academics (or were ‚Äúedited‚Äù by real scientists).  And who is now at the helm?  Petrik?  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DrBwV1dj_DjI"><i>For those who do not know.</i></a> <br><br>  <b>Findings:</b> <br>  1. We need solid courses (preferably for several years and several related subjects at once), rather than individual topics. <br>  2. A multi-level system is required.  At least two obvious levels: for all and for those interested. <br>  3. A significant step towards improving the quality of educational materials can be made only by a team of several highly qualified professionals from several areas (teacher, scientist, director, etc.).  Is it expensive?  No more expensive than the ‚ÄúElectronic University‚Äù of the Far Eastern University ( <a href="http://navalny.livejournal.com/714473.html">navalny.livejournal.com/714473.html</a> ). <br><br><h4>  Functional </h4><br>  In addition to the standard functions of social networks, that is, all kinds of relationships between students / teachers / parents, and electronic document systems, there are several elements that I would like to highlight. <br><br>  The first, (screenshot from khanacademy), is the tree of knowledge.  The advantages of having such an organization for all courses are obvious.  How and for what reasons to build it is a separate story. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/419/24e/9a9/41924e9a9f230067aeae03abb765eaf1.jpg"><br><br>  The second important point I would highlight a section for parents.  In which, apart from assessments and the progress of the child, there would be more materials for classes along with the child, accompanied with the advice of teachers and psychologists.  This is a certain feature of our country - it is customary to teach children by ourselves (in some families) <br><br>  Thirdly, it is anonymity.  For example, in the same 100ege.ru suggest to enter the name of one of the parents.  Naturally, this is not checked, but the possibility of quietly entering and looking around seems to me important. <br><br>  I ran over the tops.  There are still such things as curricula, class statistics, virtual boards for communicating with a tutor, and so on.  These are all fairly obvious things and all services will implement them as needed. <br><br>  A little about the features of each system. <br>  <b>Dnevnik.ru</b> - a step towards e-schools.  This giant has been developing a fully electronic system since 2007 and already has more than a hundred people in its staff.  At the moment, the concept of the site implies the creation of content (lessons, tasks) by resource users (teachers for students), has not yet had its own lessons and lectures. <br>  <b>Eftsh.ru</b> - offers video lectures recorded with the participation of school lecturers at MIPT.  The set of proposed items is still small, but the approach to students is more individual.  This service provides the ability to verify written work. <br>  <b>100ege.ru</b> - perhaps stands out online lecture broadcasts and the ability to ask questions to the lecturer in the air.  She has materials in mathematics, Russian language, physics, social science and computer science. <br>  <b>Interneturok.ru</b> is a huge archive of all kinds of lectures in all subjects (unlike eftsh.ru and 100ege.ru, which are focused on physical science), but without any interaction with the student. <br><br>
<h4>  Control systems, carrots and gingerbread </h4><br>  The problem of motivation when learning to hug a computer is an edge.  System whips difficult to imagine.  Gingerbreads are too virtual (In khanacademy, these are badges for avatars. According to Khan, the presence of these pictures has a huge impact on student performance. By the way, if you haven‚Äôt seen, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DnTFEUsudhfs">then</a> his presentation on TED.). <br><br>  A good addition would be to receive certificates of completion.  But it‚Äôs hard to figure out what legal value they could carry.  The benefits of admission to the university would be interesting, but this, in the light of the USE, is hard to imagine. <br><br>  This is one approach.  The other is to create a sense of obligation.  This can be done by introducing some time frame.  For example, in 100ege.ru, since the lectures are broadcast live, it becomes necessary to return to the subject regularly.  However, the record remains available.  Given the weak activity of the listeners (as in the real class), which I watched after reviewing several entries, the online broadcast does not make sense for the silent schoolchildren.  In some Western courses, access to the recording of a specific lecture opens, for example, for a week.  But who bothers to save the video?  No one. <br><br>  What methods work, and what does not specifically on our students, I think, no one knows.  It is necessary to conduct an experiment. <br><br>  <b>A little about the load.</b>  It seems to me that a run can serve as an excellent comparison.  When you run, the body gets tired, and in the morning it hurts.  That is, from the point of view of pleasant sensations, there is little in this activity.  Athletes who are assisted by competitive spirit, and people who have realized the need for this activity for their own health, can force themselves to run regularly. <br><br>  Let's try to apply this logic to online activities.  To create a ranking of students requires a rating system.  In the case of online courses, it will obviously be very easy to cheat and the meaning of the rating will disappear.  This can only work for complex / creative / Olympiad tasks, when each decision is individual.  Then the second thing remains - to explain to the person what <i>it</i> needs.  How to do this without global ideological work with the population?  I do not know. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/51f/dc8/65c/51fdc865c8930f80c2e6e09c554d50e7.jpg"><br>  <i>Source of the picture: <a href="http://www.ria.ru/culture/20120530/660729716.html">www.ria.ru/culture/20120530/660729716.html</a></i> <br><br><h4>  Conclusion </h4><br>  With this post I wanted to show that online learning systems exist and work, both in the world and in Russia.  However, the abundance of similar material (and its appreciation by users) speaks about several things: <br>  1. It is claimed. <br>  2. No one is ready yet to invest in the creation of lectures a large amount of money / effort / time (more than competitors).  All materials are variations of the teacher‚Äôs recording at the blackboard. <br>  3. The potential of Internet education is not revealed to the end.  That is, we are still in a state where resources and content of any quality are perceived with a bang. <br><br>  <b>PS:</b> I have bracketed such an important component as the interactivity of educational materials.  For example, a site with an animated map of the Great Patriotic War <a href="http://www.pobediteli.ru/flash.html">www.pobediteli.ru/flash.html</a> , a set of physical animations <a href="http://demonstrations.wolfram.com/">demonstrations.wolfram.com</a> , etc. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/146390/">https://habr.com/ru/post/146390/</a></p>
