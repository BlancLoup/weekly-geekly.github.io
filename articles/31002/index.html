      Here I present to you a sample of several of his most interesting sayings that will help you succeed in life: <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b>1. Steve Jobs says: ‚ÄúInnovation distinguishes a leader from a catch-up.‚Äù</b> <br><br>  New ideas have no limits.  It all depends on your imagination.  It's time to start thinking in new ways.  If you are associated with a growing industry, think about ways that produce more results, more pleasant customers, easier work with them.  If you are connected with a fading industry, quickly drop it and change it before you lose your job.  And remember that delay is inappropriate here.  Start innovating now! <br><br>  <b>2. Steve Jobs says: ‚ÄúBe the benchmark for quality.</b>  <b>Some people were not surrounded where innovation was the trump card. ‚Äù</b> <br><br>  This is not a fast path to excellence.  You must make excellence your priority.  Use your talents, abilities and skills in the best available way and jump over your competitors by adding something special that they lack.  Live to a higher standard, pay attention to details that can make a difference.  Having an advantage is easy - just decide to suggest your innovative idea right now - in the future you will be amazed at how this merit will help you in life. <br><br>  <b>3. Steve Jobs says: ‚ÄúThere is only one way to do a great job - to love it.</b>  <b>If you do not come to this, wait.</b>  <b>Do not rush for business.</b>  <b>As with all others, your own heart will help you in an interesting case. ‚Äù</b> <br><br>  I would have reduced this phrase to four words: ‚ÄúDo what you love.‚Äù Look for an occupation that will give you a sense of meaning, purposefulness and satisfaction in life.  Having a goal and striving for its realization gives life meaning, purpose and satisfaction.  This contributes not only to improved health and longevity, but also gives you a bit of optimism in difficult times.  Are you happy to get out of bed on Monday morning and wait for the start of a new work week?  If you answered no, then look for a new lesson. <br><br>  <b>4. Steve Jobs says: ‚ÄúYou know that we eat food that other people grow.</b>  <b>We wear clothes that other people sewed.</b>  <b>We speak languages ‚Äã‚Äãthat were invented by other people.</b>  <b>We use mathematics, but it was also developed by other people ... I think we all say that all the time.</b>  <b>This is a great reason to create something that could be useful to humanity. "</b> <br><br>  Try to make a difference in the world and make a useful contribution.  You will find in this a greater meaning of life, and it is also a good remedy for boredom.  You can always do something.  And tell others about what you have done.  However, do not impose it, be complacent, or be fan of it - it will only scare people away.  But at the same time you should not be shy at the right moment to inform others about what you have done. <br><br>  <b>5. Steve Jobs says: ‚ÄúThis phrase is from Buddhism: Opinion of a beginner.</b>  <b>Great to have a newbie opinion. ‚Äù</b> <br><br>  It is a kind of opinion that allows you to see things as they are, which constantly and in a single moment can become aware of the original essence of everything.  Beginner's opinion is Zen practice in action.  This is an opinion that is innocent of prejudice and expected result, evaluation and prejudice.  Think of the novice opinion as the opinion of a small child who looks at life with curiosity, surprise and amazement. <br><br>  <b>6. Steve Jobs says: ‚ÄúWe think that we mainly watch TV in order for the brain to rest and we work at the computer when we want to turn on the convolutions.‚Äù</b> <br><br>  Many decades of scientific research have vividly confirmed that television has a detrimental effect on the psyche and morals.  And the majority of people watching television know that their bad habit dulls them and kills a lot of time, but they still continue to spend a huge part of their time watching the box.  Turn off your TV and you save a few ^ 10 (this is a funny translator :)) of your brain cells.  However, be careful - you can be stupid at the computer.  Try to talk on serious topics with someone who plays shooters for 8 hours a day.  Well, or in the race ... or role-playing games - in general, it does not matter. <br><br>  <b>7. Steve Jobs says: ‚ÄúI am the only person who knows what it is to lose a quarter of a billion dollars in a year.</b>  <b>It forms personality very well. ‚Äù</b> <br><br>  Do not identify the phrase "make mistakes" and "be a mistake."  There is no such thing as a successful person who has never stumbled and / or made mistakes - there are only successful people who made mistakes, but then changed their lives and their plans, based on these very mistakes made earlier (without making them henceforth).  They consider mistakes as warnings, and not as signs of their hopelessness.  To avoid mistakes is to live a life of inferiority. <br><br>  <b>8. Steve Jobs says: ‚ÄúI would exchange all my technologies for a meeting with Socrates.‚Äù</b> <br><br>  Over the past decade, many books have appeared on the shelves of bookstores all over the world showing the lessons of historical figures.  And Socrates, along with Leonardo Da Vinci, Nicolaus Copernicus, Charles Darwin and Albert Einstein, is a source of inspiration for independent thinkers.  But Socrates was the first.  Cicero said about Socrates that "he dropped philosophy from heaven, bestowing it on ordinary people." So, use the principles of Socrates in your own life, work, study and relationships - this will bring more truth, beauty and perfection into your everyday life. <br><br>  <b>9. Steve Jobs says: ‚ÄúWe are here to contribute to this world.</b>  <b>Otherwise why are we here? ‚Äù</b> <br><br>  Do you know that you have good things to bring to life?  And did you know that these good things were abandoned while you poured yourself another cup of coffee, and decided to just think about it instead of making it a reality?  We are all born with the gift to give it life.  This gift, well, or this thing - your vocation, your goal.  And you do not need a decree to solve this goal.  Neither your boss, nor teacher, nor parents, no one can solve it for you.  Just find this single target. <br><br>  <b>10. Steve Jobs says: ‚ÄúYour time is limited, do not waste it living another life.</b>  <b>Don't get hooked on creeds that exist on other people's thinking.</b>  <b>Do not let the looks of others muffle your own inner voice.</b>  <b>And it is very important to have the courage to follow your heart and intuition.</b>  <b>They somehow already know what you really want to do.</b>  <b>Everything else is secondary. "</b> <br><br>  Are you tired of living someone else's dream?  Undoubtedly this is your life and you have every right to spend it as you wish without any obstacles and barriers on the part of others.  Give yourself the opportunity to develop your creative talents in an atmosphere free of fear and pressure.  Live the life that <b>you</b> choose and where you yourself are the master of your destiny. <br><br>  <b>Conclusion:</b> <br>  Each lesson can be difficult at first to flow into your life, but if you follow them in turns, you will notice an immediate improvement in your overall performance.  So go ahead, try it. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/31002/">https://habr.com/ru/post/31002/</a></p>
