Apple iOS does not bring past joy and pleasure?  Well, choose Windows Phone ... <br><br>  Today we will try out the Nokia Lumia 1320, and at the same time we will look into the capabilities of Microsoft‚Äôs mobile ‚Äúaxis‚Äù - all of a sudden you decide to abandon the ‚Äúgreen robot‚Äù in favor of ‚Äúlive tiles‚Äù.

      The flange, the ceiling, sorry for the expression, phablet, phonblet - as soon as smartphones with huge diagonals are not called.  There is also a sharper one - ‚Äúshovel‚Äù  There are a lot of such gadgets for Android.  Apple, as you know, is still "content with little."  As far as Windows Phone is concerned, Nokia was the first in the segment of devices ‚Äúfor whom one hand is not enough,‚Äù at the end of 2013, she presented two tablet phones, the Lumia 1320 and 1520. We opted for a more affordable model. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  So, 1320. First of all, naturally, you pay attention to the streamlined body of bright color - for this model you can choose one of 4 interchangeable panels.  It‚Äôs impossible to say that the gadget fits perfectly in your hand: trying to take the smartphone more comfortably, you involuntarily press one of the buttons - all of them are located on the right side - volume, switching on, photo. <br><br>  Yes, and our advice - buy a cover at once.  The dropout rate for such devices is the highest among all gadgets.  Where to wear 1320?  That is the question.  Bag - impractical option.  It fits in a pocket of spacious jeans.  But it will be treacherous to delay the jacket pocket, and even more so a shirt.  In general, there is something to think about. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c96/448/d77/c96448d779a5eb4de7230cfa4dbb4125.png"><br><br>  Information on the 6-inch screen is distinguishable even on the brightest day - let's say thanks to the polarization layer.  Lovers will also be pleased to read from different exotic angles - 1320 is equipped with an excellent IPS-matrix.  Those who are upset are those who like to count the pixels and measure their density - the screen resolution of the Lumia is ‚Äújust HD‚Äù, with only 245 pixels placed per inch. <br><br>  Inside - Snapdragon 400 with a frequency of 1.7 GHz, video Adreno 305 and gigabytes of RAM.  It works better than most predecessors, but does not reach the indicators of Lumia 1520 - the benchmark will not allow to lie.  On the other hand, the system works quickly and confidently - this is proved by the interface without brakes, and the constant satellite of the browser, Asphalt 8. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/1c5/e7c/e31/1c5e7ce3186419d64fa5b87d93c92fe7.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f56/fa0/ba7/f56fa0ba73b84bb51f75c6dbae3c8f3c.png"><br><br>  <i><b>Nokia Lumia 1320</b></i> <i><b><br></b></i>  <i>price: 12 500 rub.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>OS: Windows Phone 8 (update Lumia Black)</i> <i><br></i>  <i>processor: Snapdragon 400 1.7 GHz</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Video: Adreno 305</i> <i><br></i>  <i>screen: 6 '', 720x1280, IPS</i> <i><br></i>  <i>RAM: 1 GB</i> <i><br></i>  <i>memory: 8 GB (+ microSD - up to 64 GB)</i> <i><br></i>  <i>3G / LTE, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, GPS, NFC</i> <i><br></i>  <i>camera: 5 / 0.3 megapixel</i> <i><br></i>  <i>battery: 3400 mAh</i> <i><br></i>  <i>dimensions, weight: 164.2x85.9x9.8 mm, 220 g</i> <i><br></i> <br><br>  Yes, I almost forgot!  In 1320, of course, there are built-in cameras - front with VGA-resolution, and the main, 5-megapixel, equipped with autofocus.  We won't blame Nokia for this ‚Äî as experience shows, a bad dancer and 3 megapixels are many.  In general, the camera is there and it shoots well.  Including 1080p video at 30 frames per second. <br><br>  The 1320 battery is not removable, but this is the case when there is nothing more to complain about - the battery capacity here is 3400 mAh - the tablet phone can withstand up to 2-3 days of your constant presence nearby. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c04/3a5/96f/c043a596fa3dd129abe907e7b3c07686.png"><br><br>  Well, as a dessert, let's discuss how Windows Phone can be your next mobile platform (by the way, our browser switched from Android to WP in just one day - more proof that modern mobile platforms continue to improve and become better every year. Although Of course, there are nuances and a lot of them ...). <br><br>  Let's start with the interface.  There is a main screen with live tiles, there is an additional one with a list of installed applications - the structure is very simple.  If we talk about living tiles, sometimes it seems that there are no ideas more brilliant, and sometimes they are annoying and very strong.  They are pretty flexible and this is a plus.  But the constant movement on the screen can turn you into a paranoid - and what if I missed some important message! <br><br>  Weakly organized settings.  There are only two working screens - ‚ÄúSystem‚Äù and ‚ÄúApplications‚Äù.  Everything related to the system settings is dumped into one unsorted heap - where, alas, no logic is visible. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/fba/2ab/11a/fba2ab11a3017780b0164e31ec4df6d3.png"><br><br>  The main question of the user who decided to change his life, and switch to another operating system - and what about Windows Phone with applications?  The answer is: there is almost everything - readers, instant messengers, digital telephony, social networks ... But suddenly it turned out that there is no sane video player (really sane).  Neither for free nor for money - if we are mistaken, drop it in the comments.  The total number of apps on the Windows Phone Store is noticeably less than on other platforms, but, as we know, not always means more. <br><br>  One of the most joyful moments of communication with the Lumia 1320 is the presence of the pre-installed mobile office suite Microsoft Office and the excellent navigation program Nokia Here.  All this works perfectly and is also absolutely free - you have already paid for using this software by purchasing a device. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c9c/b81/7a5/c9cb817a548466ecbfb342c499ad0482.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/049/234/7d8/0492347d8358b45639dbcad91215612b.png"><br><br>  What is the bottom line?  In short, the device is not bad and you can go to buy it right after watching the video: and to the old seasoned Windows Mobile users - well, it‚Äôs time already!  - both thirsting for new sensations, and users who have bought pants with large pockets ... Especially since you can find offers from 11 thousand rubles on the Web.  Yes, cons.  He is big.  Really big.  Well, the internal memory is too low - 8 GB clogs in 1 week.  Immediately take a microSD card. <br><br>  By the way, there will be time, come on the light - we posted the <a href="http://bit.ly/P71jeQ">Nokia Lumia 1320 video review</a> on the Geek to the Future YouTube channel. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/219751/">https://habr.com/ru/post/219751/</a></p>
