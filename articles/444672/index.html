According to the results of the research, a rating of the best devices that are available for Russian buyers was compiled <br><br>  In total, experts studied 93 pairs of wired and 84 pairs of wireless headphones of different brands (at the same time professional studio models were not tested).  All models were tested for parameters such as the quality of the sound transmission system, the strength of the headphones, functionality, sound quality and ease of use. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The testing itself was conducted at a leading international laboratory that operates according to the ISO 19025 standard (quality standard adopted by the International Organization for Standardization).

      To assess such parameters as the quality of the sound transmission system, the strength of the headphones and their functionality, specialized equipment was used.  The sound quality and convenience of the device was tested by experts.  The technique is not capable of such an assessment. <br><br>  Interestingly, some manufacturers of non-professional headphones indicate a very wide range of reproducible frequencies, which, first, does not always make sense, and second, often does not correspond to reality. <br><br>  ‚ÄúA person‚Äôs hearing is arranged in such a way that he perceives sounds with a frequency of about 20 to 20,000 Hz.  Anything that is below 20 Hz (infrasound) and anything that is above 20000 Hz (ultrasound) is not perceived by the human ear.  Therefore, it is not very clear when the manufacturer of household (non-professional) headphones writes in the technical description that they reproduce frequencies in the range of 10 - 30000Hz.  Perhaps he is counting on buyers not only of earthly origin.  In fact, very often it turns out that the stated characteristics are very far from real, ‚Äùsaid Daniel Meerzon, Chief Sound Engineer of the Moscow Talking Station. <br><br>  He also believes that when choosing headphones, you need to check the sound quality of your favorite music in a particular model.  The fact is that someone likes bass, but someone, on the contrary, does not like them.  Preferences are always very individual, the sound in the same headphones by different people is perceived differently. <br><br>  Creators of music, performers, music teachers were invited as specialists.  All invited - of different ages and with different musical preferences.  The tests were performed by listening to seven music sets in each pair of headphones: classical, jazz, pop, rock, electronic music, as well as speech and pink noise (the spectral density of such a signal is inversely proportional to the frequency, it can be detected, for example, in heart rhythms, in almost any electronic devices, as well as in most genres of music). <br><br>  As for checking various characteristics, a special device was used to assess the quality of sound transmission for measuring amplitude-frequency characteristics and sensitivity in electroacoustics, audiometry, and other similar areas.  This device is often called an artificial ear.  With it, experts estimate the level of acoustic leakage.  This indicator helps to understand whether the device ‚Äúholds‚Äù the sound well.  For example, with a large leak, the music played in the headphones is audible to others, plus the bass is distorted. <br><br>  And such an indicator as the functionality included checking for ease of use - for example, whether headphones are easy to fold, how easy or difficult it is to determine where the earphone is for the left ear, and where for the right ear, whether a case or a case is included in the package, whether there are headphones built-in buttons for receiving calls and controlling music playback, etc. <br><br>  Another important parameter is the safety of using headphones.  At the same time, experts warn that the number of people who suffer from sensorineural hearing loss has now dramatically increased.  One of the reasons for the violation - listening to loud music in the headphones. <br><br>  Well, the participants identified the best sound quality wired headphones <br>  Sennheiser HD 630VB, wireless - Sony WH-1000XM2, Sennheiser RS175, Sennheiser RS ‚Äã‚Äã165. <br><br>  In the top 5 wireless models, which took the lead in all evaluable indicators, came out: <br><br><ul><li>  Sony WH-1000XM2; </li><li>  Sony WH-H900N hear on 2 Wireless NC; </li><li>  Sony MDR-100ABN; </li><li>  Sennheiser RS ‚Äã‚Äã175; </li><li>  Sennheiser RS ‚Äã‚Äã165. </li></ul><br>  Three of the best wired: <br><br><ul><li>  Sennheiser HD 630VB (maximum sound quality score); </li><li>  Bose SoundSport (iOs); </li><li>  Sennheiser Urbanite I XL. </li></ul><br>  Experts from Roskachestvo also recommended listening to music with headphones for no more than three hours a day and no more than two hours in a row, and not at maximum volume.  Otherwise, there is a possibility of ear damage and hearing loss. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/444672/">https://habr.com/ru/post/444672/</a></p>
