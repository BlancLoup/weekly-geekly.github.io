  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Addition to the article "Subtleties of resume in German IT-companies"</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  I read with interest the article <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/post/346616/">‚ÄúSubtleties of Resume in German IT Companies‚Äù</a> .  Since I have been living in Germany for quite a long time, I will allow myself a few comments and additions that I hope will be useful to Habr's readers and will not offend the author. <br><br>  To begin with, over the past eight years I have changed three places of work without writing a single resume. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  Head hunter </h2><br>  In recent years, the modern ‚Äúslave trade‚Äù (Leihfirmen) has greatly spread in Germany.  Headhunters gradually ceased to be intermediaries engaged in the search and selection of personnel and transformed into full-fledged employers.  Many intermediaries not only find a candidate and transfer his documents after a preliminary assessment to a potential employer, but also hire employees themselves.  The broker actually buys you in bulk by signing a long-term contract, and then sells you in retail to various projects. <br><br>  It is impossible to reach many employers with clear names (GER30) from the street.  Concerns with a world name I work with a limited number of intermediaries, the so-called.  Premium Supplier.  Premium Supplier is not always a classic intermediary, very often it is a system integrator serving this client.

    <h2>  Alternative search </h2><br>  To get into the database of headhunters you do not need to write a resume, let headhunters find you.  It is for the search that they receive their fees (from ‚Ç¨ 10,000 per person, in the case of a six-month probationary period).  Like most people working in IT, I have a profile in professional social networks.  For Germany, the most important thing is Xing, but the presence of a LinkedIn profile does not hurt.  <a href="https://www.xing.com/">Xing</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/">LinkedIn</a> are the source of frames for intermediaries. <br><br>  As for job search through such portals <a href="https://www.monster.de/">Monster.de</a> or <a href="https://www.stepstone.de/">StepStone.de</a> , many open vacancies are copies of the same positions, placed by different intermediaries or the employers themselves.  It must be remembered that not every published vacancy implies a free workplace.  Quite often they are stirred for formal compliance with the law.  Many positions, especially leading ones, should be put up for a free contest, and this place can be long occupied. <br><br>  Another effective job search opportunity is active contact through Xing.  My steps were the following: I wanted to deal exclusively with Citrix, then I wrote to the managers of several platinum partners of the company, in the end I was invited for three interviews (one of them turned out to be successful).  I did not send documents, but I placed them on my page in a closed section (this turned out to be quite enough).  Most importantly, I did not have to write a cover letter (Anschreiben) to the package of documents.  I found the two subsequent positions in a similar way, only the documents were needed after the interview, and they were an absolute formality. <br><br><h2>  Documents </h2><br>  If you are writing a resume cover letter (Anschreiben), then it should be worded as a response to the announcement.  Try to list exactly those technologies that are listed in the ad.  Remember, your letter will first get to employees who are often not connected with IT, but only check documents for compliance with requests. <br><br>  And yet, the Germans are very fond of cliches, talk about the ability to work in a team, about getting pleasure from work.  Mention this.  (The work gives me great pleasure - die Arbeit macht mir sehr viel Spa√ü). <br><br>  Diploma and Certificates (especially Certificates) do not matter much, much more important is the Skill-Profil, which includes a list of your projects. <br><br><h2>  Interview </h2><br>  As for the personal interview, then most often it takes place after one or two telephone interviews.  I'm not sure that a handshake, a space in front of you, or agreement to have a cup of coffee will be crucial.  Be confident, do not look away from the interlocutor, do not be late and do not forget about the dress code. <br><br>  Very often you can be offered a trial day, where you will be given tasks as close as possible to the real ones.  The results of this for and will be decisive. <br><br><h2>  Your first steps </h2><br>  Register in the above social networks (Xing, LinkedIn), fill out your profile in detail.  Create your profile on Monster and StepStone, it will give intermediaries an extra chance to find you. <br><br><h2>  Samples of documents </h2><br>  About 15 years ago I created a <a href="http://resume.koelnru.de/%26ei%3DDBdeWtfSGKqQ6QSo57OoCw%26start%3D10%26sa%3DN%26biw%3D1920%26bih%3D968">project</a> with information that is necessary for a successful job search in Germany.  I am not ashamed to say that this was a one-of-a-kind page in Russian.  It may be the content of the site and not the most relevant, but its materials can really help you.
