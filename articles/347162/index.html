My path was not easy and I worked on various positions, from Junior Front-end trainee, to the founder of my own IT company.  Today I decided to share my experience and vision of what is happening in IT recruiting from the former seller.  I will tell you the importance of relationships with developers and what‚Äôs the reason for selling. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  First, let's compare the specifics of the work of headhunters in IT and other industries. <br>  Work with production equipment is very close for me, and therefore I will compare IT and production.

      When I worked as an engineer, when I was looking for a job, I had to throw a CV in different companies en masse.  Job search has always been very difficult, even if there is a shortage of specialists in the market and very good academic and practical training for candidates. <br>  Today we see about the same state of affairs for young Junior developers.  They have to send CVs, knock on different doors, where, most often, they are denied without giving a reason. <br><br>  But, the position of the developer is diametrically opposed, as soon as he gets a good experience and becomes noticeable to recruiters.  Most often, GitHub, LinkedIn, well-compiled profiles come to him, of course, it is worth mentioning the HH account, which should be kept only at the beginning of a career.  Today I don‚Äôt even have a CV, and when they ask me to send it, I already know that I‚Äôm hardly going to work for this company. <br><br>  Over the past 15-18 months, I received about 900 letters proposing to consider a new excellent opportunity, in a unique company that has no analogues in the world, with a great motivational package.  Somehow on Paveletskaya even a refrigerator with beer in the office offered ... <br><br>  Are you serious? <br><br>  <i>Recruiter on the note.</i>  <i>Want the best shots - learn how to find and run for developers.</i>  <i>The best have to be hunted for months or even years.</i>  <i>Buy good sneakers and go.</i>  <i>And also look at the ‚ÄúSilicon Valley‚Äù, where Gilfoyle decided to change jobs, and how he was tried to be hunted.</i> <br><br>  Probably, it's time to ask: ‚ÄúAnd what‚Äôs the sale?‚Äù.  Perhaps for many it will not be obvious.  Making the transfer of the first letter, messages to the messenger, dialing the candidate on the phone, whether you want to or not, you make a cold call, cold contact with the person.  And I will tell you that you do not do it - you have already been sent to spam for a long time.  Many developers for mail recruiters have filters that send you to spam.  Everyone is tired of getting unique opportunities, everyone is tired of annoying recruiters. <br><br>  Did you wonder why?  The answer is quite simple: the demand for developers is much larger than the number of candidates who are ready to switch to a new job.  And the recruiter needs to be able to make cold contact, sell a vacancy to a candidate.  Especially a pity is the outsourcing of recruiters who need to sell their services to the client and the vacancy to the candidate. <br><br>  The problem of recruiters is that when you first contact you talk a lot, but you need to ask questions.  When they call me on the phone, I don‚Äôt even have time to remember what kind of company I can barely remember the name for conducting a conversation. <br><br><ul><li>  Why do I need so much information? </li><li>  Can't you just ask if I need a new job or not? </li><li>  Why are you wasting our time? </li></ul><br>  Learn from sales, appreciate someone else's time.  They asked - got an answer.  No - not a sentence, but an opportunity to learn from a person why not?  Read Neil Rekhema and his spin.  Understanding the person, it will be easier for you to offer him something.  Everyone works with a pack of vacancies.  You have a lot of them, we certainly know. <br><br>  <i>Recruiter on the note.</i>  <i>Learn to properly contact candidates.</i>  <i>Sometimes simple questions give very good results.</i>  <i>Set up a person to talk, do not ship him with what he does not need.</i>  <i>Anyway, he will not remember what you told him.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>Very often on Linkedin, I see recruiters who write the number of their contacts in their profiles, for example, ‚Äú+8000‚Äù or ‚Äú+10000‚Äù, showing their importance.</i>  <i>This causes me only an understanding, that a person cannot work, and nothing more.</i> <br><br>  I suggest to play math. <br><br>  Imagine that: <br><br><ol><li>  The average duration of a senior level developer in a company is 2 years </li><li>  average salary - $ 3000 </li><li>  search cost will be 50% of salary = $ 1500 </li></ol><br>  The cost of the search here, I specifically underestimate, many recruiters ask for 1 to 2 developer salaries, but we take the minimum value. <br><br>  Now suppose that a recruiter wants to earn $ 1,500 a month, imagine that companies pay the entire amount to the recruiter immediately and don‚Äôt delay payments for 2-3 tranches. <br><br>  So, in order to get $ 1500 a month, we need to have 24 developers, provided that they will change work after 2 years in turn in their month.  And, arranging these developers every 2 years in a cycle, we get what we want. <br><br>  Let's be realistic, and such a situation is possible.  You ask how?  The answer is simple - you need to know who wants to change jobs and when, and where new employees are needed, to build a cycle.  Instead of looking for new candidates, learn to maintain relationships with old ones, then they will come to you when they want to change jobs.  Typically, recruiters after getting theirs are slaughtered by candidates, especially outsourcers.  Even if you collect all 6 billion contacts to yourself in profile, there will be no point, until the moment you start building relationships with the candidates.  In addition, they are also a good source of knowledge on technology stack!  A simple birthday greeting on Skype can sometimes provoke a conversation that can be beneficial for everyone. <br><br>  <i>Recruiter on the note.</i>  <i>Learn how to build relationships with candidates correctly, and they will tell you when you can sell them.</i>  <i>Do not hesitate to congratulate them on holidays, to talk even occasionally, let them remember you only from the best side.</i>  <i>Sales, having in base of 5-10 regular customers, receive a lot of benefits from it.</i>  <i>Quantity does not give quality, without properly aligned relationships.</i> <br><br>  Relationships - the main strength of sales and well-built relationships with candidates, will help you not only gain experience, but also achieve success in your career.  Do not hesitate, take the experience of sales and use in recruiting.  The sooner you start, the sooner you yourself will see how you can do magic in work. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/347162/">https://habr.com/ru/post/347162/</a></p>
