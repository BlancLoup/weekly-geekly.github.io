    <img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/0fd20db0/e69567b8/f2520d88/2ed81c79.jpg"><br><br>  The guests at Skolkovo began to arrive from early morning. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/7f2be654/d178f436/facf77f4/93c1378c.jpg"><br><br>  The festive ceremony began at 11-00, but from the very morning in the hall stood the stands of Intel partner companies, which showed the latest news.  Here, for example, a prototype car computer IVI based on MeeGo. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/1f534d76/e9ffc887/883f4d68/445c8705.jpg"><br><br>  Intel employees went to an improvised exhibition and they could ask any questions. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/ac919a84/52742eb2/c8d70033/ea41afe1.jpg"><br><br>  Separately, the stand was Intel Health, which demonstrated all the latest technologies in medicine, which were implemented with the help of Intel. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/2eec2317/8d4f144a/377e76a8/d30cea0a.jpg"><br><br>  A pretty nurse could even demonstrate the technique in practice.  After all, no wonder there was a model of man. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/f1242539/523c074f/5912e165/7fae30fa.jpg"><br><br>  3Q introduced several laptops and fresh tablets. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/dd576473/63762a7a/361cf31a/c0ace3f9.jpg"><br><br>  Depo Computers showed their new computers based on Intel processors. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/98c5ddb0/27b95446/affa6fea/6a32a94d.jpg"><br><br>  Lenovo representatives pleased with the Ultrabook, which is only 14.1 mm thick.  The company predicts that this laptop will soon force all competitors out of the market.  Well, this is quite plausible, considering that despite its small size, this ultrabook has great features. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/2419f19c/7b4fbf95/30acc6be/d4d570dc.jpg"><br><br>  In size it is like a tablet.  Very thin, really interesting device. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/fafe3a0e/eb883e9d/924a9d87/6c1803a2.jpg"><br><br>  In general, Lenovo had a very interesting booth.  What was just there, in addition to laptops.  These are dumbbells, glasses, books and toys.  So I wanted to go and play. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/46a9881c/26b49433/99282c9a/e75438ba.jpg"><br><br>  In the lobby were put up a few candy bars, which could get information about Intel. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/3a380606/7d36a0e5/87f6e813/910cf642.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/2ac627cb/1bbab74e/ec90111b/cde07783.jpg"><br><br>  The official part was led by Kamil Isaev, director of research and development (SSG) in Russia and the CIS.  He focused the guests on the achievements of Russian colleagues in the development of the corporation in the field of research and development. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/e4641303/3ababf51/b6babe6b/62834127.jpg"><br><br>  After that, he introduced Dmitry Konash, regional director of Intel in the CIS countries.  Dmitry spoke about the history of Intel in Russia, starting with the first office of the corporation, opened in the building of the Moscow Vocational School in 1991. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/d11b444b/1bb55671/fbf1f8d1/4a55f38d.jpg"><br><br>  He also spoke about the first Intel customers in Russia. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/a21f8d1c/52f523b9/d9ed5521/6514a0bc.jpg"><br><br>  Today, Intel in our country is not only the largest research and development center in Europe, located in the offices of Moscow, St. Petersburg, Nizhny Novgorod, Novosibirsk, with sales and marketing offices in Kiev and Almaty.  The corporation has become an integral part of the IT industry and economy, an active participant in social processes in these countries, and a respected employer. <br><br>  After Dmitry Konash, William Savage (Bill Savage), vice president of Intel Software and Services Group (SSG), took the stage.  He focused on the structure of Intel's development centers in Russia.  He stressed that they represent different groups: software and services (SSG), architectures (Intel Architecture Group, IA), technologies and production (TMG), research laboratories (Intel Labs).  The main themes of the development are the creation of compilers, computational libraries and tools for creating programs (Intel Parallel Studio, Intel Cluster Tools, Media SDK and MeeGo SDK), new microarchitectures. <br><br>  Thomas Kilroy, senior vice president of Intel and general manager of the marketing and sales group, noted that technology is everywhere around the world.  People are increasingly communicating in social networks, using e-mail, create and share content.  Intel continues to implement Moore's law, making processors more and more efficient and energy efficient.  Mr. Kilroy paid particular attention to Russia as one of the global leaders in the IT field.  The volume of investments in Russia and other CIS countries, according to forecasts, in 2010-2014 will show the largest percentage increase among all European markets.  Thomas also demonstrated the ultrabook, which Intel has already shown at Computex-2011. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/f4be5f11/0faf55a6/24e5dabb/2df3bd15.jpg"><br><br>  Kirk Skaugen, vice president and general manager of the Intel Architecture Group, dedicated his presentation to Intel‚Äôs strategic vision for cloud computing and introduced the next generation standards and technologies that will make data centers safer, more efficient, easier.  He also showed the Tick-Tock model, which is the model by which micro-architectures and processors are created at Intel. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/d39d96ac/f982d4dd/d2ccb2ca/cf537b6f.jpg"><br><br>  In his speech, Steve Pawlowski, Senior Honored Research Engineer of the Intel Architecture Group, general manager of Cross-IAG Architecture and Pathfinding, presented the trends and achievements required for data processing, software, wireless networks and security, which can all improve the work of mobile computers to, on the one hand, make our lives easier, and on the other - to solve not only the main tasks of users, but also the global problems of humanity. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/06eef281/28262404/7d9fd1b4/d4728235.jpg"><br><br>  After the main reports, technical sessions were held: <br><ol><li>  Datacenters, high performance and cloud computing. </li><li>  IT in the enterprise. </li><li>  Intel solutions for mobile platforms. </li><li>  Software and computing platforms. </li></ol><br>  Read more about the sessions <a href="http://ru.intel.com/20years/techicsession.html">here</a> . <br><br>  Meeting Steve Pavlovski with reporters in Africa, where they asked him their questions in the press center. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/a6081462/fefd4e2b/4e427fd1/205ee463.jpg"><br><br>  Some official facts about the company: <br><blockquote>  Who: Since 1972 in the EMEA region, Intel has been providing 16,000 jobs for people in the high-tech industry.
