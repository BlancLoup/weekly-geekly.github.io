My name is Roman Novikov, I am the project manager of Platforma@Mail.Ru.  Today we will talk about what constitutes our platform today, what has happened interesting lately and what is planned for the future. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/43e/fd6/fc0/43efd6fc065b23f3f3d5e867a5427d9f.png">

      Let's imagine what the Platform is, based on how the ancient people represented this world: imagine a turtle that flies in space.  The turtle is our API through which we give out information about users.  It has three large elephants.  The first is social products for sites: like buttons, widgets and authorization for sites.  Another elephant is external clients and applications: APIs for a variety of mobile platforms, thanks to which mobile clients can use social networking features.  The biggest elephant is, of course, a platform for social games.  And on these three elephants all applications that use Mail.Ru resources are kept. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c26/d70/3fd/c26d703fd651e24a3d521d8c91dccbb8.png"><br><br>  Frankly speaking, our API is not a turtle at all, but a smart hare.  It allows you to process thousands of requests per second, and we are going to make it more productive and faster this year.  We are constantly improving the API and introducing advanced technical solutions. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/1bc/890/b71/1bc890b71f1c712a6065fd6be6164598.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/9a6/a69/3fa/9a6a693fa22256f5f47a353aa8f185c0.png"><br><br><h4>  Social products </h4><br><br>  One of the main events of the year is the integration of our social networks My World and Odnoklassniki.  One of the fruits of this integration was the general block of buttons "Like".  Using one simple block of code, you can insert two buttons on your website at once, with the help of which users will be able to share the content of your website with friends on social networks Odnoklassniki and My World. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/952/cc9/c81/952cc9c81ff49822a046bdf4bababe1e.png"><br><br>  As the statistics showed, the CTR of such a unit grew by 15%.  The shows of the new block already account for more than 40 million hits a day.  Over the last month, the increase in the number of "ball" was 60%.  With these buttons you get access to the audience of the largest social networks.  We specifically worked for several months to ensure that you do not need to customize when installing the buttons.  Copied the code - and it all worked!  We will do the rest of the work for you.  ‚ÄúSharing‚Äù in one click, no pop-ups, the user does not leave your site, and the information enters the social network instantly.  Everything is fast, easy and convenient. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e42/2c4/20e/e422c420e3f95fb9e64e1a7d4f4af6c7.png"><br><br>  If we talk about common figures, our social plugins are shown more than 250 million times.  in a day! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f89/c94/b3b/f89c94b3b0148559749d808055400bdc.png"><br><br>  By clicking on the balls, 5 million 800 thousand users from our networks return to your sites daily! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/bf2/519/89d/bf251989dffa07e57133966eecb840ed.png"><br><br>  We also have solutions for authorization on sites.  Today, those who write their own authorization do wrong.  Use social networking solutions!  I think 99% of those sitting in this room have social media accounts.  I was right: -) Draw conclusions - do not want to torment users: use our authorization.  This is easy for you, because everything is done in a trite, without any configuration.  And it is very simple for users.  Our statistics show that the user is gradually learning this and is no longer afraid of logging in to third-party sites using the Mail.Ru account.  In addition, you can receive additional information about the authorized user and his friends through our API. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/492/4eb/0ab/4924eb0ab79de32ea1364319d43217b7.png"><br><br>  Ten thousand sites have already established authorization.  New sites are added very quickly.  Join and you! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/04c/2a1/2df/04c2a12df120b114e39d0658c57d1944.png"><br><br>  Our main goal this year is to take the first place in the coverage of the Like buttons on the Runet. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/3d5/cba/580/3d5cba5806971bdae401a806ebe80499.png"><br><br>  The goal is ambitious, complex and aggressive.  But feasible.  And we will do everything to fulfill it. <br><br>  In addition, we want to make a single authorization using Mail.Ru and Odnoklassniki accounts.  For you, this will open access to a huge audience that can log in to your site using our social networks accounts. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/52c/6cb/207/52c6cb2074867d97752329d646cf13b8.png"><br><br><h4>  External applications and clients </h4><br><br>  Now about external applications.  We fully supported the OAuth 2.0 protocol, provided the core API functionality for implementing mobile clients, and supported third-party libraries. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/66a/f92/0f3/66af920f35087775c015539ca251b903.png"><br><br>  A vivid example of a mobile client using social networking features is Agent@Mail.Ru application for iPhone and Android, which allows you to quickly publish photos on a social network.  An interesting frame was caught, and right there your friends in My World see it. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/9f6/30f/841/9f630f841a4c8fa4efe128d5916a9890.png"><br><br>  What are our goals?  We will focus more on the mobile direction - for us it is a strategic task. <br><br>  So that developers can make full-featured clients, we will try to maximize coverage of the social networking API.  And besides that, the platform will provide full support for developers of third-party libraries and the SDK. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/2f4/605/10c/2f460510c0bdf0c7b2851869725f8c8e.png"><br><br>  If you have any ideas - write to us, we will definitely help you. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/4df/c6d/252/4dfc6d2520ae4958fdf6aafe190c8669.png"><br><br><h4>  Social games </h4><br><br>  Now the most interesting part is social games.  This is one of the most powerful drivers for the development of our platform. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b6e/c76/338/b6ec7633820872e256e9339129d896b5.png"><br><br>  On the day, 3 million users play social games in My World, and 7 million users in Odnoklassniki.  The average check that a user pays in My World is 141 rubles a day.  And many pay more. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/4ca/95c/e01/4ca95ce01797d5a0a779b094723706e4.png"><br><br>  Here is a graph that shows the change in the turnover of our platform for the year.  From January to October, we were able to double our turnover. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/cb2/5dc/9bf/cb25dc9bf1f73e6f88c1cc517d3c3070.png"><br><br>  Social apps are serious business.  If you earn big money in this business, then you are already working in My World and Odnoklassniki.  If you want to start earning them - come to us. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/31b/5af/13f/31b5af13fac74f46632018586bb3ac05.png"><br><br>  How have we achieved such success? <br><br>  We have launched a new application catalog, completely changing it.  Top applications are now built on the basis of ARPU, turnover and daily audience.  And we will soon add retention to this formula. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/4f3/550/1da/4f35501dad77012dcfca54c425ed169d.png"><br><br>  We have altered the section "New".  Now they are sorted not just by the release date, but also taking into account the time spent in the catalog, and it works very well. <br><br>  Recommended applications: previously they were added by hand.  We removed it.  Everything should be simple and transparent.  Now the sample is based on socio-demographic statistics.  For example, I am 25 years old, I am a man, and it shows me what a paying audience of the same age and the same sex plays as I am.  There is also a new viral channel, ‚ÄúFriends Actions‚Äù. <br><br>  In the autumn, ‚ÄúMailiki‚Äù appeared in ‚ÄúMy World‚Äù - a new single currency. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/357/1b4/c2c/3571b4c2ceab89b0cfd262fa394c7f67.png"><br><br>  For developers, this is a flexible monetization setting.  Previously, you forced users to pay SMS for 1, 3 or 5 dollars.  Or ask to pay for the service using electronic money.  Now you can use the mailboxes that the user already has in their account!  At the same time, the price of the service can start even from one mail.  One Mailik is equal to one ruble. <br><br>  Remember that the key task of monetizing users is to increase the percentage of paying audience.  If a user can pay one ruble, he should be able to pay it without any problems, because he will return to you and pay ten more. <br><br>  There are more options for replenishing mails.  We supported ‚ÄúPay by click‚Äù, supported Qiwi machines and much more.  You can use balances on user accounts that accumulate.  The user pays for the gifts, he has 3 mails left, he can pay them in your applications, it is very convenient, and most importantly profitable. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b41/429/227/b4142922791ce43b2e102607ae6116cb.png"><br><br>  And, if we started talking about money, then about this money, 85 kopecks, if you can call it money, my colleague <a href="http://techforum.mail.ru/speaker/21">Roman Kochanovsky</a> from the <a href="https://target.mail.ru/">Target @ Mail</a> . <a href="https://target.mail.ru/">Ru</a> project will <a href="https://target.mail.ru/">tell</a> . <br><br><h4>  85 kopecks </h4><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/864/9f5/f1a/8649f5f1a1a44d6943ef8feb894ff6d4.jpg" align="left">  - Hello.  Now it will be clear what I do.  What is 85 kopecks?  This is a special cost per thousand ad impressions for developers.  When we say ‚Äúspecial,‚Äù what do we mean?  This price is 14 times less than the cost of advertising regular customers on Odnoklassniki.  This price is 7 times less than the cost of advertising in my world.  14 times and 7 times, notice the lower price for developers.  That's how much we love you. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a46/5d1/7da/a465d17da45474f523e0f631512fea8e.png"><br><br>  The novel voiced the most magnificent figures: on the day, 3 million users play in My World and 7 million on Odnoklassniki.  This is a country, a whole country.  And we are trying in every way to increase the population of this country, so we offer such tariffs. <br><br>  So what is this advertising?  This is an advertisement in the Target project, in the service of self-placement of advertisements that works with the socio-demographic characteristics of the audience.  First of all, the key feature of the service is the ability to target the audience by gender and age.  Who needs it?  First of all, this is necessary for ordinary clients or game developers who make products / games separately for men and separately for women.  The most popular targeting is the targeting used in the service - this is targeting an adult audience.  It‚Äôs one thing to show ads to children under the age of 12, and quite another to adults over the age of 25.  At this age, a person, as a rule, has already graduated from the institute, has a job, savings and is at the peak of consumption - he is actively given loans, etc. Accordingly, this audience is very interesting for any advertiser, whether it be a game developer or a direct client.  Accordingly, 25+ is our most popular targeting. <br><br>  Advertising can be bought by CPC and CPM-model, ie, either for a thousand impressions, or for one transition.  We rate only real shows.  This means that if a banner is placed, for example, at the bottom of the screen, then its demonstration does not occur, if the user has not gone down or scrolled to that part of the screen where the banner should be displayed.  The user has not gone down - there is no display, there is no debiting of money (tariffing) from advertisers, nobody pays extra money. <br><br>  Supporting developers, we made a very simple workflow system.  An application developer on My World or Odnoklassniki can take and pay for an advertising campaign from his social network account, i.e.  from the account where the money is earned by the application. <br><br>  Let's see what it brings to developers.  Here is an example of an ad: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f7a/69b/4b3/f7a69b4b31b5fc53c7cf7253039c6376.png"><br><br>  ‚ÄúDo you agree?  You want to make an offer, do you accept it?  I agree!".  What do you think, what is the target audience for?  That's right, this ad is targeted at women.  In this case, the advertiser chose age - from 12 years old, gender - female, bought advertising for a thousand impressions at 85 kopecks at the Odnoklassniki site, received a CTR of 0.31% and a cost per click of 27 kopecks.  That is, the cost per click is cheap, as we call it.  It is necessary to try to make a completely unsuccessful campaign (there are such examples, of course, but they can be counted on the fingers) so that the cost of the transition (click) for advertisers-developers exceeds 1 ruble. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/062/f2f/45d/062f2f45d285bdbd810a28dfc484f826.png"><br><br>  The second example is Paintball 3D, shooter, ‚ÄúA network game for shooting fans! A variety of weapons, do not miss!‚Äù Here, advertising, respectively, is targeted at men over 12 years old, costs 85 kopecks per thousand impressions, gives 0.26% CTR and 33 pennies transition. There are 27 kopecks, here there are 33, in general, quite comparable indicators. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d68/772/94b/d6877294b577e112e3ee5e67ee8283c8.png"><br><br>  But this slide always causes a storm of emotions among the audience, now I will tell about it.  When we first launched our service, we were contacted by one of the potential customers, who eventually became a real customer, and said: "I am a co-owner of the developer company, I want to test your new advertising mechanisms."  As a test, he decided to create his own profile.  In this form, the example states: ‚ÄúHello, stranger, you can see my page right now!  View page &gt;&gt;.  He had a lot of creative ads, including a ‚Äúbrown-eyed brunette‚Äù, something like that ... Which target man chose to target?  Women <nobr>18-24 years old.</nobr>  He bought advertising for 85 kopecks for 1000 impressions, received a CTR of 0.53% received a CTR, and 16 kopecks cost him a switch.  He bought a minimum package of advertising for 5 thousand rubles (at that time the cost of the minimum order was higher).  As a result, he received 31,200 clicks on his profile.  31 thousand transitions to 5 thousand rubles.  He was shocked, we were shocked.  He got a very good effect, then he bought more ads, then another and another, and in total he received 140 thousand clicks on his profile in Odnoklassniki. <br><br>  At one of the conferences I was asked: ‚ÄúTell me, what is the conversion?‚Äù.  Well, we didn‚Äôt ask him about the conversion, but you can look at the page of his friends on Odnoklassniki.  And this is only a small part on the page of his friends, who fit into one screenshot: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b08/41b/4f8/b0841b4f8682b07921902ac6950a2e1b.png"><br><br>  One man seemed to be bothered by some random method.  He, apparently, even before this was added. <br><br>  We interviewed several developers, asked them to share their views on how they like to advertise with us.  Here is what they said: ‚ÄúThose people who come for advertising from Target install the application in <nobr>25-40% of</nobr> cases.  Further, these people cost <nobr>30-90 kopecks.</nobr>  A paying audience, i.e.  those users who have installed the game start playing it and buying some game elements there - this is another <nobr>1-5%</nobr> of this audience.  If you count all this and take the average value, which we know about - 141 rubles per day, then for each invested ruble there will be about 10 rubles of return. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/42a/47f/273/42a47f273182c7ca5b0c8e1d75b42804.png"><br><br>  That's how we love our developers.  If we take the most extreme, the worst indicators and the worst conversion into installs, we get a value of one ruble, i.e.  at least advertising is fought back.  One ruble invested in advertising gives <nobr>1-10</nobr> rubles of return.  Those.  advertising at least fights. <br><br>  Remember, we are giving the iPad for the best question?  And for any other question we give 3,000 rubles in Target.  For any question.  I have a coupon that allows you to conduct a test campaign of 3000 rubles. <br><br>  We all know that the New Year is coming.  The stores have already appeared corresponding bells and decorations for the Christmas tree.  And this means that these are not only congratulations from the president, but also new plans.  Roman will tell us again about our plans. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c51/2f2/db3/c512f2db3932ee4f9654b1b7c1b518d2.png"><br><br>  Plans <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d25/4c5/229/d254c5229e1ff7e655b0883b629c670e.jpg" align="left">  We now talk about this date - January 1, 2012. <br><br>  Many developers blame us for not initiating them into Platform plans.  Therefore, we would like to start telling you in advance about major innovations on the Platform. <br><br>  In particular, this date is the entry into force of the new contract for the developers of My World and Odnoklassniki.  We continue to unify the standards by which we operate. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/abe/e6e/e1f/abee6ee1fb3e2e34cf04270e8fd594a4.png"><br><br>  What will this mean for developers?  Firstly, the contract form for ‚ÄúClassmates‚Äù and ‚ÄúMy World‚Äù - this will be an open offer.  The percentage of Platform revenue in both networks will be fixed at 50%.  The workflow process is brought to a single standard.  You will not need to send multiple sets of documents.  You will work with one legal entity.  This will significantly reduce the headache of your accountants and reduce the flow of extra paper. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/98e/4c8/fac/98e4c8fac443cd0876830933e40cd798.png"><br><br>  Now - about our future plans. <br><br>  We are going to launch an automatic bonus package distribution system for advertising packages in the Target@Mail.Ru system very soon.  The system will distribute packages based on KPI applications such as retention, DAU, and ARPU.  And you can get more free ad impressions than before. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/1e7/eb8/9c1/1e7eb89c168a4f865ee2f6d6a3b01732.png"><br><br>  We will launch new reworked notifications in applications.  On December 1, 2012, we will transfer all payments in applications to mails, so I strongly advise you to do this in advance. <br><br>  Next, we are waiting for the union of portal for developers based on api.mail.ru.  You will be able to work with all applications in Odnoklassniki and My World using one personal account and through one portal.  And also we are going to launch new viral channels. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/88b/bd0/680/88bbd06807059b9e1c70e0e415d65295.png"><br><br>  First, the platform does not stand still.  We are trying to release as many new products as possible and set ever more ambitious goals and objectives. <br><br>  But the main thing that we try to be guided in our work is the feedback we receive every day from you. <br><br>  Therefore, let's communicate and continue to shape our professional environment in which we operate. <br><br>  We are not going to stop, and, as Henry Ford said, everything can be done better than it has been done so far. <br>  Thank! <br><br>  Come to us on the portal <a href="http://api.mail.ru/">api.mail.ru</a> and follow our <a href="https://twitter.com/mailruapi">twitter</a> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f11/778/e34/f11778e34b451bb425dca3306dfdd117.png"><br><br><blockquote>  <b>- Good day.</b>  <b>My name is Alina.</b>  <b>You have now talked in sufficient detail about the effectiveness of advertising on Mail.Ru, ‚ÄúClassmates‚Äù, you can light up a little bit of the competitors: Facebook, VKontakte, how is their efficiency?</b>  <b>Worse, better - in your opinion?</b>  <b>Thank.</b> </blockquote><br><br>  We try to make it so that our efficiency would be better, of course.  Yes, and we strive for this in absolutely all the ways that are available.  You see that we strongly support our developers, and we not only sell advertising, we give free packages, we increase the very population that we play every day. <br><br>  We largely work for the future and, of course, we are trying to do all these things better, but from the point of view of targeting, we can solve most of the problems with socio-demographic characteristics. <br><br>  I have in one of the presentations there is such a slide, when the presence of a large number of pens, settings, leads to the fact that an ordinary user, that is, a person who can professionally create games, buy, sell something, giving the impression that they put him in the cockpit of the plane and show him the instruments of control and say, fly.  He can fly in the event that for him the autopilot works.  So, we try to do in our work, the same autopilot, automatic gearbox, if that pleases.  We are trying to make the simplest mechanism possible that is controlled from our side, that is, we turn the knobs ourselves so that you can be efficient.  That's about efficiency, you coupon. <br><br><blockquote>  <b>Hello, my name is Vsevolod, I am a student of Plekhanov Russian University of Economics.</b>  <b>What is the commission for developers now?</b>  <b>And after the proposal - can introduce some kind of social program for students - lowering this commission?</b>  <b>We will go then!</b>  <b>Thank!</b> </blockquote><br><br>  In Odnoklassniki, the commission is now 50%, in My World, the commission is 30%.  The new contract unifies the rules on commission.  We see that the market is formed and ready for this.  Also, this step is based on positive monetization statistics.  At all conferences, all our developers say the following: ‚ÄúYou know, I was so surprised that the audience of My World pays so much.  Where did you get so many rich people, why do people pay so much?  From where  Why?".  So come, start working.  And about the program for students, we have not thought, but do not exclude such a possibility. <br><br><blockquote>  <b>- My name is Rustam.</b>  <b>First question.</b>  <b>You talked about indicators, the fact that a catalog is being formed, and so on, will you give such information to users so that they understand which way to improve, which way to clean in general?</b> </blockquote><br><br>  - Do you mean the developers? <br><br><blockquote>  <b>- Developers.</b> </blockquote><br><br>  - Of course. <br><br><blockquote>  <b>- Will the expansion be any time soon?</b> </blockquote><br><br>  - Yes.  See, firstly, we now give this information.  Secondly, we are already ready to give you information on retention.  It is already considered, we just do not show it.  We follow him, calculate, calculate models.  To issue - we will issue necessarily, the only thing, I think it will be either in December, if we don‚Äôt have time, then in January. <br><br><blockquote>  <b>- One more question.</b>  <b>As far as I know, Mail.ru Group owns part of the VKontakte shares.</b>  <b>Will there be some unification of the platform - not only Odnoklassniki in My World, but also VKontakte, some simpler way?</b> </blockquote><br><br>  - You know, if I answer this question, Paul will show us something.  I do not want to run up. <br><br><blockquote>  <b>- Christina Krychno, BeMyDress project.</b>  <b>Roman, you have a question.</b>  <b>You showed the ‚ÄúShare‚Äù buttons, and I, as a platform, wonder how many people share all this, how many publish?</b>  <b>Because when they click this button, they go to your page.</b> </blockquote><br><br>  - Do not leave. <br><br><blockquote>  <b>- Do not leave?</b> </blockquote><br><br>  - Look, you click on the button, and a small bubble appears on your page, and this is not a pop-up, not a separate window, nothing.  Just a small element appears - ‚ÄúYou shared a link on a social network‚Äù and nothing else happens.  And instantly in my news feed, a message appears with a link to the site. <br><br><blockquote>  <b>- Hello, my name is Gaillard, the company "video enthusiast."</b>  <b>You said that you want to take a leading position on the "Like" buttons.</b>  <b>It turns out, as I understand it, this is quite an active work with content, with study, with pulling the site.</b>  <b>Need support for Open Graph protocol.</b>  <b>And in what direction are you going to develop "My World"?</b>  <b>Because contact for communication?</b>  <b>Facebook - socialhub.</b>  <b>And in what direction are you moving?</b> </blockquote><br><br>  - The question is interesting.  The main task: to make My World convenient for communication, so that users stay in it as long as possible.  Just yesterday, I was released with the designer at 3 am because we were thinking how to make one of our services even more convenient.  We are constantly working on it.  And we are going to interact very closely with our partners. <br><br><blockquote>  <b>- Hello, my name is Maxim.</b>  <b>What deductions do developers get from applications that are becoming popular?</b> </blockquote><br><br>  - Under the new contract? <br><br><blockquote>  <b>- Yes.</b> </blockquote><br><br>  - 50% <br><br><blockquote>  <b>- And another question.</b>  <b>How often do you go on such links, which are located on the right of the screen in "My World" and in the mail?</b>  <b>Links that you have demonstrated on the screen.</b> </blockquote><br><br>  - If you are interested, then I turn, if not interested, then I do not turn.  I can not say how often this happens, I do not think.  You know, this is a question of how many times you blink a day, I never thought about it. <br><br><blockquote>  <b>- Hello, my name is Olga.</b>  <b>In continuation of the topic about the union Mail.ru and "Classmates" question.</b>  <b>The unification of user pages happened automatically.</b>  <b>How will the blog be linked to Mail.ru and one or several groups in Odnoklassniki?</b> </blockquote><br><br>  - Which groups? <br><br><blockquote>  <b>- Group companies, for example.</b>  <b>Some kind of social group.</b> </blockquote><br><br>  ‚ÄúWe haven't thought about it yet.‚Äù <br><br><blockquote>  <b>- Will it be an application or will it be set up in your account?</b> </blockquote><br><br>  - Honestly, I do not have a ready answer to this question yet.  Literally just finished with garters users.  You can now link accounts.  How we will do next, we will first see how the users, they may not like it at all, what we have launched.  We look at the statistics, after that I can tell you about it. <br><br><blockquote>  <b>- Rashidov Marat.</b> <b>    ,   ,             ,    -   , , , ,        .   ,  Mail.ru   enterprise-,     ,  - enterprise-   -         - ,  - ,  ,     ?    enterprise      ?</b> </blockquote><br><br> ‚Äî  ,  Mail.ru ‚Äî         . ,    ,        ¬´ ¬ª,   ‚Äî      .  ‚Äî ,   ‚Äî  .      ,     ‚Äî .   , ,  ‚Äî   ,    ,         ,    , ,  ,  .       1,  ,     -,     -  ,   ,     ,  .  .      . <br><br><blockquote> <b>‚Äî ,   .       ¬´¬ª  ,      1000  .   .  ‚Äî    ,  ,      .    ,     ,   ,     .      ¬´¬ª   ,         ?</b> </blockquote><br><br> ‚Äî    .   ,   -  -  ,      .    ,   ,        ,      ,  .         .     .  ,         ,     .        .      ,   ,  ,     ,   - .         ,    ,    ,    ,   .        ,  , ,    ,     .    , : ¬´   - !¬ª.     .  ,      ,     .             ,  ,       . <br><br>     . -,  ,  ,          .    feedback.   ,  ,   . ,       .      .      - .    ,         ,   .      ,     .  ‚Äî      ,      feedback,     ,      .   .     ‚Äî          ,    .  ,   -  ,    .     ,      ,  : ¬´, .  ,     ¬ª.     ,             ,      Mail.ru. <br><br>      ,      ,      ,   ‚Äî .   . <br><br> <i>(        iPad-,    ¬´@Mail.Ru:   ¬ª         @Mail.Ru  3000 . ‚Äî . .)</i> <br><br> And the winner is‚Ä¶     iPad.    ?   . ,     . , , ,     ,      .
