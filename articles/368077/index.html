This year, Russian journalists are running at MWC at a breakneck pace, like the last time - who knows, who knows ... <br><br> <a href="https://geektimes.ru/post/260978/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/aa4/7a8/e04/aa47a8e047e149708e2dd176c751bd23.jpg"></a> <br><br>  As usual, the Asian telecom giants occupied the central places in the pavilions, among which the <b>ZTE</b> brand was particularly noted.  The Chinese tried to create a building for everyone, having built a huge stand of several rooms.  Some journalists studied consumer electronics innovations, others hung out in the smart home section, others got acquainted with the developments on mobile networks of the fifth generation. <a name="habracut"></a>

    <h4>  Smartphones Blade V7 </h4><br>  At MWC, the company brought some very interesting new products that literally argued among themselves for the attention of the press.  Formally, the main announcement of the stand was the ZTE Blade V7 and V7 Lite smartphones - two dvuhsimochnyh brothers, the differences between which are almost more than similarities. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f91/aa9/cb1/f91aa9cb1ed0473f98ca5cebd6f3e610.jpg"><br><br>  The elder Blade V7 got a full metal case and a huge 5.2-inch display with a resolution of 1920x1080.  The rounded glass adds visual appeal to the phone.  The heart of the smart became the MediaTek MT6753 system with eight cores Cortex-A53 1.3 GHz, 2 GB RAM and 16 GB flash.  The rear camera received a 13 megapixel sensor with fast focusing (0.3 ms), and 5 megapixels with a pseudo-flash were selected for selfies using the screen backlight. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/5ce/fc4/f43/5cefc4f4374a47e3b28e99ca1ceab6d6.jpg"><br><br>  ZTE Blade V7 Lite, it would seem, should be a simplified model of Blade V7.  But only the display, which received a modest resolution of 1280x720 by 5 inches, and the central MediaTek MT6735T chip with four Cortex-A53 cores, were simplified.  But the V7 Lite has a fingerprint scanner and an 8 MP front-facing camera with a separate flash.  It is not very clear why the younger version of the smartphone is something even better than the flagship, but, given the potentially low price, this can only be welcomed.  By the way, the first market for ZTE Blade V7 Lite will be Russia, and only after a while the smartphone will be released in other countries. <br><br><h4>  Spro Plus Tablet </h4><br>  A lot of smartphones were presented at the exhibition, the more interesting another device from ZTE looked like - a portable projector-tablet Spro Plus.  In short: this is a projector combined in one case (not to be confused with a pico projector) and a full-fledged Android tablet, both powered by a capacious battery.  Spro Plus is not the first such device in the brand portfolio: according to ZTE's assurances, two previous versions of Spro sold for a total circulation of more than 500 thousand pieces. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/47f/ffd/b6b/47fffdb6bfbb42108d168dff143eb1f5.jpg"><br><br>  A special feature of the Spro Plus is the luminous flux that is very powerful for portable devices - 500 lumens.  For comparison, in pico-projectors lamps shine by only 50 lumens, and even the previous Spro 2 could boast a flux of only 200 lumens.  Instead of a LED, a laser light was used in the projector, which in the end gave a high brightness and a much better contrast than LED.  Spro Plus produces a picture with a diagonal of up to 300 inches, and a working diagonal for any conditions is 80 inches with a distance of 2.4 meters from the screen.  The resolution of the matrix is ‚Äã‚Äã1366x768 pixels. <br><br>  The presence in the Spro Plus Android-tablet is fully justified by the autonomy - it is easier to turn the video and presentations directly on the device than to connect it to a laptop.  And here ZTE went beyond reasonable limits by installing an 8.4-inch QHD-screen in the projector!  It's not entirely clear why this resolution is needed if Spro Plus is more likely to be used as a projector.  The tablet works on Android 6.0 with a special shell.  The version with the Wi-Fi module is built on the Snapdragon 801 chip, and Wi-Fi + LTE on the Snapdragon 625. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/fcd/70c/2b5/fcd70c2b51f74fbdb2aaa2fc4c06ab99.jpg"><br><br>  If the usefulness of such a device seems doubtful to a Russian user, then after the enthusiasm of the Western press and readers it becomes clear: on the other side of the border, ZTE Spro is in great demand.  In fact, the device replaces a laptop and a stationary projector, and thanks to the very nexile SoC on Spro Plus, you can even play or watch a movie.  Of course, with the projection on the wall.  500 lumen, of course, is not so hot what brightness in comparison with full-sized projectors, but also what a jump in comparison with pico-projectors.  ZTE was commended for not trying to make the device as thin as possible to the detriment of the battery - inside there is a 12100 mAh battery installed - this should be enough for 4-6 hours of projection. <br><br><h4>  Smartphones AXON </h4><br>  The AXON line was announced at the end of the past year, so that in some way ZTE AXON smartphones did not become a novelty.  But the whole series with ZTE brand highlights was exhibited.  If the Blade family consists of budget-friendly phones, then AXON is the flagship device with the coolest parameters possible.  And that is characteristic, the prices for these flagships are very decent: AXON mini is already sold in Russia for an average of 25 thousand rubles. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d0b/1f8/506/d0b1f8506dc8400faab8a00efc8e2c46.jpg"><br><br>  The series includes three models: Elite, Mini and MAX.  Elite is a full-metal smartphone with a 5.5-inch FHD-screen with rounded edges.  The heart of the device was the Snapdragon 810, the RAM is 3 GB, that is, as much as Android needs (joke).  But the killer feature AXON Elite is a double rear camera, consisting of 13-megapixel and 2-megapixel auxiliary sensors.  In the pictures taken by AXON Elite, you can play a little focusing, almost like in Lytro cameras.  The technology is not new, but so far only a few manufacturers use these two-way cameras.  So that those who wish can test this chip, ZTE has just built a model of a Chinese city in its zone in miniature. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c4a/af3/f2a/c4aaf3f2a3e04b7c8bc6a3775b091eb3.jpg"><br><br>  AXON Max - a kind of "bandura" (read the phablet) with a six-inch AMOLED screen, but with a resolution of 1920x1080.  Chips Max also became the camera, but this time not the rear, but the front one.  ZTE has allocated a 13-megapixel sensor for selfie lovers!  True, the device is so large that when you try to make a "self" you can accidentally drop it.  Another strong point of the phone is its battery.  4140 mAh is enough for several days of normal operation, and Qualcomm Quick Charge 2.0 allows you to recharge the battery in half an hour. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a90/774/8e9/a907748e934d40059d4530dd82ee9180.jpg"><br><br>  AXON Mini, despite its name, is even more interesting than its fellows.  So, this particular smartphone received a 5.2-inch Super AMOLED-screen.  By the way, did you catch the joke of the naming?  The phone with a screen diagonal of 5.2 inches received a Mini prefix ... In addition to the screen, the AXON Mini was noted by fingerprint and retina scanners, as well as a separate Japanese audio codec from Asahi Kasei Microdevices.  The latter must indulge the complacency of audiophiles, who decided to listen to music from a smartphone. <br><br><h4>  Wearable electronics </h4> <br>  ZTE AXON Watch was presented six months ago and has not changed since then - a 1.4-inch round AMOLED screen with a diameter of 400 points, the Chinese system Tencent OS as a response to Android Wear, 512 MB of RAM, a 300 mAh battery and IP67 protection. <br>  Much more interesting were other wearable devices of the company.  For example, the ZTE Music Band differ from the AXON Watch in its tiny, round screen of 0.82 inches.  The Music Band has no special ‚Äúsmart‚Äù functionality, the gadget can only receive notifications about phone events, monitor heart rate, physical activity and sleep, and control the camera and player on the smartphone.  Even the battery in the clock has a modest capacity of 60 mAh. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c77/b5c/2d6/c77b5c2d6adf4b36a6497d305d16a425.jpg"><br><br>  I'd like to mention a couple of fashion accessories: Charm Band Dragon's Melody and Charm Ring R1.  Behind the first beautiful name is a female accessory without a display.  The cute bracelet serves as a simple activity tracker, but at the same time it does not externally display an electronic gadget in itself.  But ZTE Charm Ring R1 is the expected continuation of the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãa smart watch - a smart ring that can measure the physical activity of the owner.  Or, given the style, the owner.  The accessory is clearly strange (an impressive ring reminds of times not so remote), but demonstrating technical progress according to the ZTE version. <br><br>  In Russia, from the mention of Chinese brands, many languidly roll their eyes, but in vain.  At Mobile World Congress 2016, the same ZTE showed that they can perfectly compete with European, and American, and even Korean brands - not only with quality, but also with innovations.  If our friends from China continue to grow at the same pace, then it is possible that in five years MWC pavilions in Barcelona will be fully occupied by Asians, while the Old World brands will lonely huddle in the corners and zones for startups. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/368077/">https://habr.com/ru/post/368077/</a></p>
