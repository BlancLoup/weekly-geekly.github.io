The success of this social network has given optimism about the future of the Internet industry.  In the end, even if Microsoft decided to buy a <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blog/lenta/28381.html">1.6% stake in Facebook for $ 240 million</a> , then good ideas really cost a lot of money.  It is no secret that investors are now looking for the next sensation, and here are some of the favorites. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b><a href="http://www.twitter.com/">Twitter.com</a></b> <br>  Twitter allows you to send text messages immediately to large groups of people, for free.  After registration, you can immediately send messages from the phone, via the web interface or IM pager - and all your contacts will receive the text. <br><br>  Message size is limited to 140 characters, which is why Twitter creators call it ‚Äúmicroblogging‚Äù.  In the outgoing year, technology gained wild popularity among geeks, but many experts believe that now Twitter will go into the mainstream.

      Some say that this is an easy way to maintain communication between relatives, regardless of the time and distance between them. <br><br>  ‚ÄúTwitter conveys a close relationship in all its details,‚Äù says writer David Weinberger.  ‚ÄúThrough him, I see small events in the lives of friends, who in the other case could only see big events when we communicate at long intervals of time.‚Äù <br><br>  What is important, Twitter has also received recognition in the business environment as an easy way to convey information to the company's customers. <br><br>  Twitter co-founder Yves Williams helped promote Blogger.com before this project was sold to Google in 2002. <br><br>  <b><a href="http://www.dopplr.com/">Dopplr.com</a></b> <br>  Thanks to Facebook‚Äôs outstanding success in 2007, we can now expect a number of clones and imitators to appear.  However, Dopplr.com is not.  This social network is trying to find its niche.  The service is designed for those who travel a lot around the world, allowing them to track the whereabouts of friends and colleagues, the same tumbleweed.  With the help of the site, familiar people can unexpectedly meet each other where they could not have imagined.  Or you can, for example, see a list of everyone who plans to visit your hometown in the coming days. <br><br>  The public launch of the site took place this month.  During testing, the audience was limited to customers of international airlines and conference attendants, but thanks to a number of practical functions, including integration into Facebook, the system is ready for a breakthrough and an influx of a much larger army of users. <br><br>  The site is founded by an international team of web developers and specialists, and is managed from an office in Hoxton in east London.  This year, two of the founders of the project, Matt Biddulph (Matt Biddulph) and Matt Jones (Matt Jones) were named among the most influential people in London. <br><br>  Jimmy Wales, co-founder of Wikipedia, said that ‚Äúdoppler‚Äù is his favorite website. <br><br>  <b><a href="http://www.seesmic.com/">Seesmic.com</a></b> <br>  After Google bought YouTube two years ago, a whole galaxy of new video sites appeared on the Web.  One of those who deserve attention is called Seesmic.  While YouTube has lately been overflowing with video hoaxes, parodies, sweepstakes, and professional marketing videos, the creators of Seesmic are trying to attract those who originally made YouTube a popular project, that is, the authors of video diaries.  This is a kind of social network in which the video bloggers should be convenient to communicate with each other by publishing small videos. <br><br>  The project has not yet opened to the general public, but has already received a number of positive feedback from testers.  The site may well be home to a new generation of self-confident, eager for the attention of Internet users. <br><br>  The startup is supported by Ron Conway (Ron Conway), one of the first investors in Google and PayPal, as well as European entrepreneurs Niklas Zennstr√∂m and Janus Friis, who created from scratch Kazaa, Skype and Internet TV Joost. <br><br>  After the official launch, this site will function more like a plugin for popular social networks such as MySpace and Facebook, and not as a replacement for them. <br><br>  Founder - French entrepreneur Luc Lemer (Loic Le Meur).  A businessman and blogger, he is known for his insolent style of behavior, but he is an adviser on Internet issues with French President Nicolas Sarkozy, which can give additional credibility to the project. <br><br>  <b><a href="http://www.etsy.com/">Etsy.com</a></b> <br>  The New York online store is created as a large market for anyone who wants to sell or buy handicraft.  If Amazon has revolutionized e-commerce, and eBay has made a name for itself, allowing people to sell unnecessary property, then Etsy hopes to introduce a new trend into society: handicraft, unique things made to order and existing in a single copy. <br><br>  Tens of thousands of craftsmen who produce and sell everything from clothing and ceramics to jewelry work through the site. <br><br>  An innovative model of product selection - for example, choosing any product by color or choosing a merchant near the house - turned out to be very attractive to the public.  The site has already registered more than half a million users and about 60,000 sellers. <br><br>  Founded by 27-year-old Robert Kalin (Robert Kalin) from Boston, the site was launched in 2005, and now the company's staff has grown to more than 40 people in New York and San Francisco. <br><br>  Some critics point to a contradiction: how to create a mass market for niche products, but Kalin says that the Etsy trading platform is absolutely suitable for any non-circulation goods and content, not only manually created, for example, for music. <br><br>  <b><a href="http://www.moshimonsters.com/">Moshimonsters.com</a></b> <br>  Mike Butcher, editor of the British Techcrunch, described the Moshi Monsters project: "This is a mix of Tamagotchi and Facebook for kids 7-12 years old, with elements of learning."  Created by London-based gaming companies Mind Candy, Moshi Monsters borrowed the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãraising virtual animals and added the concept of social networking and puzzle. <br><br>  Each player takes under his care a little monster who is the ‚Äúentrance ticket‚Äù to the site.  To care for your pet, you will have to solve various problems and put jigsaw puzzles.  Monstriki can communicate with their own kind, creating traffic in a social network, but strictly observing the privacy of children.  Cartoony graphics and huge addictiveness of the game suggest that Moshi Monsters can be a real hit in the UK, after which the project will open for Europe and the USA. <br><br>  The market for children's websites is now growing very rapidly.  For example, the virtual world of Club Penguin, launched two years ago, was bought by Disney Corporation for $ 350 million this year. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/31343/">https://habr.com/ru/post/31343/</a></p>
