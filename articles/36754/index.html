Programmers shortage.  Those that are are not good for anything.  Familiar expressions? <br>  So we felt it on ourselves some time ago.  Since the search did not give the desired results, it was decided to teach by ourselves. <br>  I will say right away that the office is large, only the development department is about 50 people.  To entice only so much people with money is an impossible task.  So, the circle of sensei was determined, who were tasked with finding 10-15 Padawans and making them worthy programmers.  Well, outlined the foreseeable term.  So, we had to find people with initial base and prepare them. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  It all starts with the choice of Padawan. <br>  Our task is to find a person who still does not know something or does not know how, but: <br><ol><li>  Will be able to figure out, learn </li><li>  Has a strong desire to learn </li><li>  Smart and smart </li></ol>
      <br>

      <br>
      So, on the way to gaining Padawan, you need to go through several steps. <br>  To find, to entice for an interview, to have an interview, to agree on a job. <br><br>  <strong>Where to find them?</strong> <br><br>  We used 3 ways. <br><br>  The first, most traditional, job ads.  The main thing is to make the right announcement <br><br>  Minimum requirements.  We list the main things, for example PHP, HTML, OOP. <br>  You can use all sorts of quality epithets reducing requirements, such as "initial level", "foundations", etc., but not abuse. <br>  Concentrating on the development (...).  We focus on a strong team (candidates must understand that there is something to learn) <br>  and interesting tasks (candidates must understand what knowledge will be where to apply).  Well, at the end we describe interesting buns (free lunches, corporate pjanki, a comfortable pillow on the keyboard, so that after sleep there are no fingerprints on the face ...).  We read the resume diagonally, the people we need are not yet able to compose them or they have nothing to brag about.  The main thing to see in writing is what was the basis for the manifestation of the qualities we need (who has forgotten, see above). <br>  Calling a person for a personal interview. <br><br>  The second is My Circle.  We are looking for circles that are interesting to us (in our case it was all that is connected with PHP and programming).  Further we work as well as with announcements - the summary. <br><br>  Third, we take 2 people, one sociable second understanding.  And we stamp to the nearest university.  We catch the latest courses studios (you will go to the dean's office, speak before the lecture, catch them in the jerk - this is already a matter of technology).  Choose the people you like (explanation of the term below) and invite you to your lair (well, or to the office). <br><br>  With the help of three sensei and HR-girl, with the efforts of half an hour a day, it was possible to ensure the flow of 2-person interviews per day. <br><br>  <strong>Have a chat</strong> <br><br>  We are not going alone for an interview.  2 people minimum.  In this case, we agree in advance who will be the soloist. <br>  We go prepared, with a clear list of all the knowledge and skills that we need.  With test questions and tasks. <br>  And most importantly, remember what qualities we need to identify.  We ask and listen carefully.  But not what the person answers, but how he answers, how he thinks, how he draws conclusions.  In addition to the standard problems about the code, you should definitely have tests for logic and general IT topics.  In general, this is the most creative part.  In the end, you have to decide for yourself whether you will work with this person or not.  If you don‚Äôt like him (at the level of sensations) you should refuse.  So how can you make nothing out of it (not because of it, but because of yourself).  It is quite normal to take a break and go out to discuss the person without delay. <br>  As a rule, after such a discussion, I summarize the summary.  First, I clearly say that this is my personal subjective assessment.  Then I tell you what a person knows, and what is his gap or misunderstanding of what he can and what does not.  If he fits, and I am ready to work with him further - I outline the perspectives, what I will do with him, what I will teach and what he will become in just a few months.  I outline how difficult it will be.  And finally - <blockquote>  "You will become ... so that ..., well, or we will dismiss you :)" </blockquote><br>  As a rule, people are imbued, and it remains for us to settle the bureaucratic part and ... <br><br>  Make a professional in a short time, according to the Brazilian system.  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/arbeit/36844/">About this in the next article</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/36754/">https://habr.com/ru/post/36754/</a></p>
