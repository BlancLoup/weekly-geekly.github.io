Experience with Italians</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/503201b8/f621feba/1421c79d/5f9d5649.jpg"><br>  In continuation of the stories of working with foreign colleagues, working abroad and my previous <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/migration/114552/">article,</a> I decided to describe my experience of working with Italian colleagues.  My experience with the Italians was not the same as with the French, that is, I did not cooperate, did not work in the same office, but carried out the ordered works, websites, projects and simply communicated with people.  In any case, it is an experience.  If everyone appreciated the previous article as a very positive utopia and everyone wanted to learn French sharply, then the Italians are completely different, <a name="habracut"></a><br>  I intersected with Italians in terms of developing several projects, carried out several websites for customers on the recommendation of my friends, I often communicate with friends who live there and also heard about the intricacies of the nature of Italians from her girlfriend who lived in Italy for 2 years.  I want to pour out all my experience in one article. <br><br>  Horror. <br>  This is how I want to evaluate the work with the Italians in one word. <br><br>  It is very hard to work with Italians because: <br>  1. They do not know what they want from the artist <br>  2. They do not really understand why they even turned to the performer. <br>  3. They are not oriented at all with what they have addressed. <br>  4. They do not even try to navigate the minimum. <br>  5. They do not know what the result should be. <br>  6. When they get what they wanted (after placing all points in the requests) they are not sure that they wanted it <br>  7. They begin to bargain even if the work is done and everything is fine and there is a clear agreed amount. <br>  8. They will eventually be dissatisfied.

      In terms of IT, it is generally difficult for me to link the two words ‚ÄúIT‚Äù and ‚ÄúItalians‚Äù. <br>  I communicated with specialists of one web studio and was a little puzzled by our conversation.  The conversation resembled that joke, where the customer was the person who offered his mother as a designer, who did the design for the wall newspaper (or whatever) fifteen years ago and she certainly understands the design more than the artist. <br>  It‚Äôs prohibitively expensive to order a website from a web studio, so we chose the option to order from an artist who was advised by acquaintances (it turned out to be me).  It is not clear why it was necessary to order the services of a designer from a web studio if I could fulfill all the requirements.  It remained a mystery to me (as a result, I did all the design, since he was probably hearing about design somewhere on the Internet), but his work was paid for and he added the site to his portfolio naturally. <br>  After doing all the work, the client periodically wrote stupid questions to me on the email and demands to do something else (do not fix something, namely, to do more) in addition to the work done, but for free.  They thought that they had overpaid me and I now have to go into <s>anal</s> slavery (at least the terms were synonymous with this expression).  Naturally no one will do anything to anyone for free, which they could not understand at all.  In the end, they did not want to pay, but from time to time they demanded that I do something to them.  Adding email to the ignore solved the situation. <br>  Now I am making a site to a friend in Italy (he is from Ukraine, but lives in Italy for quite a long time). <br>  It turns out that living in another country changes people at the cellular level.  Doing work for him was akin to what an indigenous Italian should do (see paragraphs above) <br><br>  As for the "techies" of Italy, he had the experience of communicating with the "specialists" of the Aruba company (sort of like a famous hoster in Italy).  Again stumbled upon a wall of misunderstanding.  Adding a network card to the server was a very fun affair: <br>  - I asked you to put the Intel network card - Well, we set.  Dlink  Dlink is Intel? <br>  Well, there were some more similar comic situations (apache is installed only on windows, it does not work in linux; we turned off the additional cooling on the server, since it was noisy etc) <br>  Support works very similarly to the support of one large Ukrainian hosting provider, but it works more impudently and irresponsibly. <br><br>  Call to support: <br>  I am I <br>  P - Technical Support Officer <br><br>  11-40 <br>  I: good afternoon.  I want to speak with a specialist &lt;First Name&gt; <br>  P: good afternoon, he went out, call later <br><br>  12-00 <br>  I: good afternoon, I would like to speak with a specialist &lt;Name Last Name&gt; <br>  P: good afternoon, and he today is a day off <br>  I: you said that he came out ... <br>  P: we couldn't tell you that (hangs up) <br><br>  13-00 <br>  I: good afternoon, I would like to speak with a specialist &lt;Name Last Name&gt; <br>  (it is this person who picks up the phone, I know the voice as I have already spoken to him earlier) <br>  P: he got sick, if you need to talk to him, call back next week. <br><br>  The most interesting thing is that they don‚Äôt even offer to talk with another specialist to solve a problem, but I‚Äôm calling only on a specific problem. <br><br>  This all considers them the norm.  IT towards IT glances very rarely as I understand it. <br>  SEO optimizers are generally "shykarnye".  The client paid some well-known company 500 euros for what they were supposed to optimize his website and bring it to visible positions in the search as they suggested.  Customer requirements as always - I want to go to the first page.  The result of the work of the optimizers - the site added meta keywords to the code, entered the site address into google.it and got a link to the site on the main page.  The client is happy (!!!) and brags about everything. <br><br>  What I wanted to say about IT - he said everything. <br>  I do not know, maybe these customers came across to me, maybe I was so lucky with technical support, maybe so lucky with the hoster, but in the article there are only facts.  Please add spaces if you have something to say about IT. <br><br>  People and communication with them.  Italians have a very high opinion of themselves.  Moreover, they simply do not know the prices for themselves. <br>  Men in Italy are worse than our ‚Äúbazaar women‚Äù.  I think there is no need to explain in detail.  Very shy.  We are ready to place our fingers in a fan, to show that they are not afraid of anything, but in fact they are hiding their heads in the sand as soon as it comes to clarifying the relationship. <br>  Italians do not like visitors.  Unlike the French, who do not particularly like to communicate with them in English, the Italians do not like even those who speak their language well. <br>  There are practically no beautiful girls / women in Italy.  All the beautiful ones were either taken away in the model, or they were leading on TV, on the street it is extremely difficult to meet a beautiful girl.  Their character is very bitchy, especially in Sicilians.  As for me, this is a cross between gypsy women and some leprechauns.  By the way, impulsive abuse in Italian sounds pretty cool, especially if it is pure Italian and not some one of its dialects. <br>  Fashion in Italy is on top, but the joke is that if there are heaps of famous stores, all Italians buy clothes, shoes and the rest there only when the collection falls in price (last season) or when sales are on.  And then everyone boasts that they bought something from the new collection just haven't worn for a long time.  With that, everyone knows that everyone buys only when it is cheap, but they continue to tell what they bought when it cost 3 times more.  Grudge up and then tell how expensive they paid for this thing. <br>  Food.  Eating meat is the lot of the poor.  Mostly eat vegetables, fish, pasta in different combinations.  Dairy products as such are absent.  Kefir, ryazhenka, yogurt - a rarity and wildness. <br><br>  Actually, such is my experience, I will hear other opinions and hear someone‚Äôs experience. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/114832/">https://habr.com/ru/post/114832/</a></p>
