Unfortunately, now not one of the high-rises built in the country is one of the ten highest buildings in the world.  Therefore, before the construction of the Lakhta Center is completed (hello to the commentators of the previous article), we will talk about skyscrapers in the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, China, the United States, Malaysia, Hong Kong and Taiwan. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/717/9ec/3df/7179ec3dfe25770099679a950623d8ad.jpg" alt="image"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  Willis Tower </h4><br>  The oldest of the ten currently existing tallest skyscrapers of the world was built in 1974 in Chicago.  Its height is 442 meters without spire, with a spire - 527 meters.  In the Russian-language Wikipedia, the Willis Tower takes 11th place, but this is somewhat incorrect: the Lakhta Center, which has already been placed 8th in the ranking, will be completed in 2018. <br><br>  Just think: for forty years, only nine skyscrapers in the world overtook the 108-storey <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A3%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BB%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B8%25D1%2581-%25D1%2582%25D0%25B0%25D1%2583%25D1%258D%25D1%2580">Willis Tower</a> in Chicago, and in the USA this result was beaten only by the Freedom Tower, opened in 2014.

      The skyscraper was designed by the architectural bureau <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skidmore,_Owings_%2526_Merrill">Skidmore, Owings &amp; Merrill</a> , which later erected both the Freedom Tower and the tallest building at the moment - Burj Khalifa in Dubai.  Initially, the building was called the Sears Tower, and the name Willis received in 2009.  The foundation of the Willis Tower stands on concrete piles driven into a solid rock.  The framework consists of nine square "tubes", forming one large square at the base.  Each such "pipe" consists of 20 vertical beams and many horizontal.  All nine "pipes" are welded up to the 50th floor, then seven pipes go up to 66, five remain to the 90th floor, and the remaining two "pipes" rise by 20 floors.  How exactly this looks is clear from the 1971 photograph. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/109/e67/6be/109e676be44f1d475cb0e7b793e43017.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/8e6/4d2/93b/8e64d293b6ee7396299e65c88ea4e0a6.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/a0b/d73/bfd/a0bd73bfd79682f4120e4c22a9571e34.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Work stands on the spire of the tower. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/a63/bd2/393/a63bd2393777e1bb09418c74f38f87ea.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The Willis Tower in this photo is on the right, with two spiers. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/2e9/9f7/b03/2e99f7b03ce26036e49f3bf90198e99c.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/f47/596/446/f475964465fb0787833f55375e42455f.png" alt="image"><br><br><h4>  Zifeng Tower </h4><br>  In the Chinese Nanjing, until the middle of the XIX century, there was a <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A4%25D0%25B0%25D1%2580%25D1%2584%25D0%25BE%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B0%25D1%258F_%25D0%25BF%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B3%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B0">Porcelain Pagoda</a> , a Buddhist temple with a height of 78 meters.  Travelers described it as one of the wonders of the world.  In its stead came the skyscraper Zifeng. <br><br>  The construction of the 450-meter high-rise Zfeng building was completed in 2009.  It is the business center of the city.  It houses offices, shops, shopping centers, restaurants and an observatory.  Total - 89 floors. <br><br>  Works on the construction of the tower lasted only four years.  In the process of changing the project: the tower could have a height of 300 meters.  For China, where the population density is extremely high, efficient land use is crucial.  The triangular platform for construction was used to the maximum: the skyscraper has a triangular base. <br><br>  The idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe architects was to intertwine the motifs of Chinese dragons, the Yangtze River and green gardens.  The river is a vertical and horizontal seam separating glass surfaces.  These surfaces themselves are, according to architectural thought, a reference to the dancing dragons.  Inside the building placed vegetation and pools. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/853/9fd/b42/8539fdb4252a895a4eb4b414aafd2860.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/38e/f80/5bc/38ef805bc0a4a3653062afb40c2c14b3.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  View of the city from the spire on a skyscraper. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/7c1/d19/803/7c1d19803abc1a863d468a0cb0881efa.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h4>  Petronas Towers </h4><br>  In 1998, the capital of Malaysia, Kuala Lumpur, built skyscrapers called <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2591%25D0%25B0%25D1%2588%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8_%25D0%259F%25D0%25B5%25D1%2582%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B0%25D1%2581">Petronas Towers</a> .  The height of two 88-storey skyscrapers is 451 meters, including the spire. <br><br>  The skyscraper is built in the "Islamic" style, each building represents an <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A0%25D1%2583%25D0%25B1_%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BB%25D1%258C-%25D1%2585%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B7%25D0%25B1">eight-pointed star</a> with semicircular protrusions for sustainability.  The site for construction was changed after geological surveys.  Initially, one skyscraper had to stand on limestone, the other - on rock, so one of the buildings could subside.  The site was moved to 60 meters.  The foundation of the towers is the deepest of the concrete at the moment: piles driven into 100 meters in soft ground. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/a2a/96e/2f1/a2a96e2f1073b72f40160ad7afd5f9e5.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Construction was complicated by an important condition: it was possible to use only materials produced domestically.  Especially for the building developed durable elastic concrete, reinforced with quartz and comparable in strength to steel.  The mass of the skyscraper turned out to be twice as large as that of similar steel buildings. <br><br>  The bridge between the twin towers secured with ball bearings.  Rigid mount is not possible, as the towers swing. <br><br>  The elevators in the building are two-story models developed by Otis.  One cabin only stops on odd floors, the second on even ones.  This allowed to save space inside the skyscrapers. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/ef3/d83/5e0/ef3d835e055bba77889d622fe6050562.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/2bb/c42/3c3/2bbc423c3347aea45bc537cf89327726.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h4>  International Commercial Center </h4><br>  Offices, a hotel and shopping centers are located on the 118 floors of the Hong Kong International Commercial Center.  Building height - 484 meters.  Originally planned to build a skyscraper height of 574 meters, but the project was changed because of the ban on the construction of buildings above Mount Victoria. <br><br>  The construction was completed in 2010, but there was no official opening: the building was already used by tenants.  From 102 to 118 floors, it occupies the highest located above ground level hotel, managed by the Ritz-Carlton.  On the last, 118th floor, the highest swimming pool in the world is located. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/08e/85e/ba7/08e85eba7635b25cf6424c41b5abb1b7.png" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/ec6/c96/080/ec6c960801b745b5b37806beb941bb61.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/eb1/0db/b1f/eb10dbb1fff174fad3ee0fddba77ef4b.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/c3c/ae5/1a0/c3cae51a0fdcf16bd50968d307deb2d1.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h4>  Shanghai World Financial Center </h4><br>  In 2008, China built the <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A8%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BD%25D1%2585%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B9%25D1%2581%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B9_%25D0%25B2%25D1%2581%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B8%25D1%2580%25D0%25BD%25D1%258B%25D0%25B9_%25D1%2584%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BD%25D1%2581%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2%25D1%258B%25D0%25B9_%25D1%2586%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD%25D1%2582%25D1%2580">Shanghai World Financial Center</a> , a neighbor of the Shanghai Tower.  The height of the 101-storey building is 492 meters, although initially it was planned to be 460 meters.  The building houses the hotel, conference rooms, offices, shops and a museum. <br><br>  The building withstands earthquakes of up to seven points, has floors protected from fire.  After the attack on the twin towers in New York, the project of the building was finalized so that it could withstand a direct hit by an airplane. <br><br>  Due to its silhouette, the skyscraper was called the ‚Äúopener‚Äù.  The trapezoid hole at the top <a href="http://skyscraperpage.com/cities/%3FbuildingID%3D7609">should</a> have a spherical shape, but the Chinese government forced the project to change so that the building did not resemble the rising sun on the flag of Japan.  Such changes have allowed to reduce the price and simplify the design.  This planned upper part of the building: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/b39/68e/c7f/b3968ec7f4daebc77e8434bc36c0f737.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Here is the result: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/72a/4d8/098/72a4d80985faaba0b1504d9a46634ee2.png" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/beb/525/d9e/beb525d9e2453d21d37735f38194f76f.png" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/a39/417/02d/a3941702ddbca5dc30fc6f9b6b96f764.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h4>  Taipei 101 </h4><br>  The capital of Taiwan, Taipei, boasts a skyscraper height of more than half a kilometer.  Together with the spire, the height of <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A2%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B9%25D0%25B1%25D1%258D%25D0%25B9_101">Taipei 101</a> is 509.2 meters, and the number of floors is 101. <br><br>  Taipei 101 for some time also differed by the fastest elevators in the world: they rise at a speed of more than 60 kilometers per hour, or 16.83 meters per second.  From the fifth to the eighty-ninth floor, people rise in 39 seconds.  Now the new record belongs to the Shanghai Tower. <br><br>  On the 87th and 88th floors there is a 660-ton steel ball-pendulum.  This architectural decision was made not only to decorate the interior.  The pendulum allows the building to compensate for gusts of wind.  Durable, but not rigid frame made of steel withstands the strongest earthquakes.  These solutions, together with a foundation of one and a half meters in diameter, driven into the ground by 80 meters, made the building one of the safest in the world.  On March 31, 2002, an earthquake measuring 6.8 points destroyed two cranes mounted on a building and killed five people.  The tower itself was not harmed.  But there is a theory that it was a skyscraper that activated seismic activity. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/e3c/3dd/da8/e3c3ddda8acac8ce454de1ef6a5dac2b.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/560/7a5/1ad/5607a51ad29687d158a614670e50229e.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/8db/0ea/886/8db0ea886162aa10e125499ca653b965.png" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/f76/8a6/b39/f768a6b396ba752a5efe93571a84ca12.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h4>  Freedom Tower </h4><br>  <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2592%25D1%2581%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B8%25D1%2580%25D0%25BD%25D1%258B%25D0%25B9_%25D1%2582%25D0%25BE%25D1%2580%25D0%25B3%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2%25D1%258B%25D0%25B9_%25D1%2586%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD%25D1%2582%25D1%2580_1">World Trade Center 1</a> in Manhattan, New York, overtook its pursuer in the face of Taipei 101 by 32 meters, although if you count the distance from the ground to the roof, the American Freedom Tower on the contrary loses the Taiwanese tower by 37 meters.  The height of the World Trade Center is 1 - 541.3 meters on the spire and 417 on the roof. <br><br>  The building stands on the site, which was occupied by the twin towers of the World Trade Center, <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A2%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D1%2580%25D0%25B8%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D0%25B8%25D1%2587%25D0%25B5%25D1%2581%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B5_%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BA%25D1%2582%25D1%258B_11_%25D1%2581%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD%25D1%2582%25D1%258F%25D0%25B1%25D1%2580%25D1%258F_2001_%25D0%25B3%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B0">destroyed</a> as a result of the terrorist attack of September 11, 2001.  The design of TsMT1 took into account the experience of the past, and the lower 57 meters were made using concrete instead of the standard steel structure. <br><br>  The building was officially opened on November 3, 2014.  It is occupied by offices, marketplaces, restaurants and the City TV Alliance. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/57c/f53/991/57cf539917718fc63f4f5ac0bf2e1541.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/257/73a/dd9/25773add9ff57a4c2991bed096c10454.png" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/585/f0d/7da/585f0d7da0f367407966759f8abceff0.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/068/257/231/0682572312628fffd30a3f9b9a1a0f91.png" alt="image"><br><br><h4>  Royal Clock Tower </h4><br>  In Mecca in Saudi Arabia, in 2012, a complex of high-rise buildings of the <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2590%25D0%25B1%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B6_%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BB%25D1%258C-%25D0%2591%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B9%25D1%2582">Tower of the House was built</a> opposite the entrance to the al-Haram mosque, where the main shrine of Islam, the Ka'ba, is located.

The walls of the building are double, it has a second shell, designed to maintain temperature. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/663/d06/83d/663d0683d359f7ee9f4c34a61577a210.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The tower has a twisted structure that adds stability to the fight against the wind. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/099/545/e1c/099545e1cbf57674f6ca30d4ba99e626.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  From this angle, a spiral chute is visible for collecting rainwater used for heating and air conditioning. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/23e/d91/871/23ed91871eb88cbd2abf11ad4f0ce87a.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/744/985/e8c/744985e8c0cd28e1d5dc86ef72650e68.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  In February 2012, a video was published, where two young and talented rufer climb to a height of 650 meters - to the very top of a construction crane that is completing the Shanghai Tower. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gLDYtH1RH-U" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><h4>  Burj Khalifa </h4><br>  Opened in 2010 in Dubai, UAE, the <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2591%25D1%2583%25D1%2580%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B6-%25D0%25A5%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B8%25D1%2584%25D0%25B0">Burj Khalifa</a> Tower overtook all existing skyscrapers and is still the leader in height. <br><br>  The tower was designed by the architectural bureau Skidmore, Owings and Merrill, which created the Willis Tower and World Trade Center 1, which we talked about earlier.  The construction of the Dubai Tower was carried out by Samsung, which also participated in the construction of the Petronas Towers.  There are 57 elevators in the building, you need to use them with transfers - only one service elevator can go up to the last floor. <br><br>  The tower houses the Armani Hotel, designed by Giorgio Armani himself, apartments, offices, shopping centers, fitness centers and viewing platforms with a jacuzzi.  Indian billionaire B.R.  Shetty completely bought two floors, including the hundredth, at a price of more than 12 million US dollars each. <br><br>  As in the case of the Petronas towers, we developed our own special type of concrete for the highest skyscraper in the world.  It withstands temperatures up to 48 degrees Celsius.  During construction, the concrete was laid at night, <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/burjkhalifatower/directory">adding ice to the solution</a> .  The builders did not have the opportunity to fix the foundation in the rocky soil, and they used two hundred piles with a length of 45 meters and a diameter of 1.5 meters. <br><br>  If the Shanghai Tower has a gutter for collecting rainwater, then in the case of the Burj Khalifa tower, this approach is not needed: there is little rain in the desert.  Instead, the building has a condensate collection system, which allows you to collect up to 40 million liters of water per year for watering plants. <br><br>  During the filming of Mission Impossible: The Phantom Protocol, Tom Cruise decided to climb the tower to write the name Katie Holmes there and take a great shot. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/f3b/dd8/14c/f3bdd814c725be35ce7cae70165df7b3.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/079/4c2/a90/0794c2a90e90bdee69bf3797b143ba76.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/0cb/b7c/d8b/0cbb7cd8b2c4209047df7213ebc38c9b.png" alt="image"><br><br><h4>  Planned buildings </h4><br>  At the moment there are only two projects of buildings that are able to stand on the first line of the ranking of the highest skyscrapers in the world. <br><br>  The Burj Khalifa, 828 meters high, does not seem so impressive compared to the <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2591%25D0%25B0%25D1%2588%25D0%25BD%25D1%258F_%25D0%25B2_%25D0%2594%25D1%2583%25D0%25B1%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B9-%25D0%259A%25D1%2580%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BA_%25D0%25A5%25D0%25B0%25D1%2580%25D0%25B1%25D0%25BE%25D1%2580">Dubai Creek Harbor Tower</a> project.  Its height on the roof will be 928 meters - that is, it will already beat the current record by 100 meters.  And the height of the spire will pass for a kilometer - reach 1014 meters.  But this is not accurate - the parameters of the building are kept secret.  Like the Eiffel Tower, the Dubai Creek Harbor Tower will be open to the World Expo 2020, if everything goes according to plan.  The foundation was laid on October 10, 2016. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/ec0/3b3/b97/ec03b3b97ab9b7f7e15ace0f900c709d.png" alt="image"><br><br>  <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_Tower">The Jeddah Tower</a> , which was laid in 2013 and is planned to be completed by 2020, must also cover a kilometer.  At the 150-meter height of the tower will accommodate a terrace with a diameter of 30 meters.  Construction is not going very fast - on December 2, 2016, 47 floors were ready.  The building will become the center of the Kingdom Center business district, which is now a desert in Saudi Arabia. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/ff6/058/a3c/ff6058a3ca62ce8df2b17ef48f887040.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/993/4c2/24c/9934c224c01a563ac8a81bad830dbb73.jpg" alt="image"></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/370161/">https://habr.com/ru/post/370161/</a></p>
