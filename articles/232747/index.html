  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Russian pilots again report GPS crashes - now in the territory of the Russian Federation</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The day before yesterday morning, the first information appeared that on the night from August 6 to 7, a massive loss of GPS signal was observed over the airspace of Nizhny Novgorod and Voronezh.  Various sources claim that emergency messages came from about a dozen Transaero, UTair and Orenburg Airlines aircraft.  So far, unfortunately, there has been no particularly new information or comments, so I would like to ask the haboukoobschestva opinion about what happened - what are the technical reasons and is it worth waiting for similar events in the future? <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/370/14b/3d8/37014b3d8fad495899fc376444403f24.jpg"><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Earlier on the night of April 29-30, a similar incident was recorded, then GPS receivers refused over the territory of Ukraine.  The message came from the pilots of the flight en route from Moscow to Tel Aviv.  Prior to this, GPS failure on April 24 at the flight Istanbul - Moscow 60 miles before the passage of Dnepropetrovsk, after the passage of the border "in the Belgorod area, the GPS work was restored."  Then Rosaviatsiya warned the airline about the need to be ready to use [in the airspace of Ukraine] "inertial systems, VOR / DME and others."  We are not talking about full-fledged operation of GLONASS, since the Russian Sukhoi Superjet 100 aircraft are mainly equipped with the appropriate equipment.

      Regarding the April case, Aeroflot civil aviation pilot Vitaly Sokolovsky gave the following comment: "The GPS system is owned and operated by the United States, and I believe that this was not an accidental interference, but a targeted shutdown of the GPS system by American experts."  He also noted that the signal can be jammed with the help of ground equipment, but Ukraine, allegedly, does not have it.  "Allegedly" - as I understand it, Rosavation has a different opinion on this matter.  On July 25, the head of department, Alexander Neradko, on the notorious catastrophe, stated the following: ‚ÄúEarlier, the Rosaviatsiya received from the crews of Russian aircraft information about the malfunctioning of the GPS satellite navigation system when flying over the territory of Ukraine.  It is necessary for the Ukrainian authorities to provide information on whether the means of jamming were used for GPS operation on the day of the incident. ‚Äù  That is, the availability of such systems is not even in doubt.  But now everything is much more interesting, because failures are fixed directly on the territory of the Russian Federation. <br><br>  The need for the use of GPS alternatives in April was indicated by the International Air Transport Association (IATA), after the same reports of failures during the flight of aircraft over the territory of Ukraine.  Quote from the Aeroflot source from ITAR-TASS: ‚ÄúOver the past few days, there have been cases of disabling GPS navigation over the Black Sea area and the airspace of Ukraine, which most likely confirms the US actions to block a certain area for receiving satellite signals.‚Äù <br><br>  According to the Federal Air Transport Agency, the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) has previously published an analysis of a similar situation that occurred in 2011.  Then, in the flight information region of Incheon (South Korea), GPS interference from the territory of the DPRK took place; the situation affected more than a thousand aircraft of 16 states. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/232747/">https://habr.com/ru/post/232747/</a></p>
