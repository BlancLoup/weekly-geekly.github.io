To organize bidding and participate in them, advanced software, hardware is used, sophisticated algorithms and original approaches to data analysis and processing are developed. <br><br>  Also in the field of finance, usually quite good salaries.  All this leads to the fact that this industry has become attractive to many IT-specialists.  Let‚Äôs talk about what kind of specialists are in demand today, what kind of knowledge you need to have in order to get a job here, what kind of projects they can offer you.

      Bonus: links to real jobs! <a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h2>  Common programming languages </h2><br>  Let's start with aspects related directly to products for exchange trading.  Most of the infrastructure of exchanges and brokerage companies is created using the C ++ language.  The creator of the language, Bjarne Stroustrup, is still <a href="https://www.morganstanley.com/profiles/bjarne-stroustrup-managing-director-technology">working</a> at Morgan Stanley Investment Bank as Director of Technology. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/d8/8g/rf/d88grftp1rqhaxkxxvaxvnsve9k.png"><br><br>  The tool he created is used to create a wide variety of software - from libraries for calculating price models of derivatives to data processing modules <br><br>  In addition to C ++, C # and Java are widespread - with their help they often implement certain parts of trading applications or front-end services of financial companies (for example, GUIs of trading terminals). <br><br>  Scripting languages ‚Äã‚Äãsuch as Python, MATLAB and R are also used to describe trading strategies and prototyping models. Scripting languages ‚Äã‚Äãare also popular, which can even be built into trading terminals, such as TradeScript, with which trading robots can be written directly inside the <a href="https://iticapital.ru/software/smartx-terminal/">SMARTx</a> terminal. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/c5/9k/uh/c59kuhgpeettnceccbn9z_udglw.png"><br><br>  <i>A simple TradeScript strategy recorded in the trading terminal window</i> <br><br>  Developers with knowledge of these languages ‚Äã‚Äãwill always find interesting projects in the field of finance. <br><br>  In addition, according to surveys, there is a demand for Python developers - this language is indispensable for creating analytical tools and quantum models.  In addition, you can find projects that use data processing technologies like Hadoop, Cassandra and Scala. <br><br><h2>  Data transfer protocols </h2><br>  Developers of financial applications will not be able to do just a well-known technology stack, they will have to face the specifics of the industry.  The most basic thing that will have to be mastered is financial data transfer protocols. <br><br>  We wrote about those that are used on the Russian market, a series of articles ( <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/itinvest/blog/242789/">one</a> , <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/itinvest/blog/243657/">two</a> , <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/itinvest/blog/261709/">three</a> , <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/itinvest/blog/270961/">four</a> ).  It is important to say that some of these protocols are international standards, but there are proprietary protocols that are used by specific exchanges and companies.  Therefore, if you plan to move to work abroad in the future, then you will most likely have to get acquainted with new protocols like <a href="https://habr.com/ru/company/iticapital/blog/278811/">ITCH and OUCH</a> with the American Nasdaq. <br><br><h2>  Not only trading applications </h2><br>  Each company has its own requirements, but some trends in this direction can also be formulated.  Specialists in working with infrastructure will not have to seriously rebuild when moving into the field of finance.  For example, developers of back-office systems need to be able to work with popular DBMSs - Oracle and the PL / SQL language are popular in the Russian market, and MS-SQL is also often used. <br><br><h4>  <a href="https://iticapital.ru/about/career/">Job example</a> : </h4><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Developer Back Office</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><h4>  Duties: </h4><br><ul><li>  Development and support of integration solutions for the back office system; </li><li>  Development of reports for the back office; </li><li>  Participation in other integration projects of the IT department; </li><li>  Application migration to APEX. </li></ul><br><h4>  Requirements: </h4><br><ul><li>  Higher technical education; </li><li>  Work experience not less than 5 years; </li><li>  Good knowledge of PL / SQL; </li><li>  Experience in query optimization; </li><li>  Oracle administration skills; </li><li>  Experience in developing applications using Oracle SQL, PL / SQL, Oracle APEX </li><li>  Web Services Development Experience; </li><li>  Knowledge and development experience in MS-SQL will be a plus; </li><li>  English is sufficient for reading documentation, conversational will be a plus; </li><li>  Knowledge of the subject area of ‚Äã‚Äãtrading and securities accounting will be a big plus. </li></ul><br>  Send letters and resume to <a href="">job@iticapital.ru</a> . <br></div></div><br>  A separate area is the development of databases that are actively used in finance.  Here, the plus is knowledge of specialized platforms, for example backQORT.  Necessary and knowledge of SQL, T-SQL and the ability to work with MS SQL Server.  Since much is ‚Äútied‚Äù to this product, knowledge of MS SQL Server Reporting Service, MS SQL Server Integration Services is usually a plus. <br><br><h4>  <a href="https://iticapital.ru/about/career/">Job example</a> : </h4><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Oracle Developer (PL / SQL, Oracle APEX)</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><h4>  Duties: </h4><br><ul><li>  Development and support of the functionality of the back office system of the organization; </li><li>  Development of reports for the back office; </li><li>  Participation in integration projects of the IT department; </li><li>  Application migration to APEX; </li></ul><br><h4>  Requirements: </h4><br><ul><li>  Higher technical education; </li><li>  Work experience not less than 5 years; </li><li>  Experience in developing applications using PL / SQL and good knowledge of PL / SQL; </li><li>  Experience in query optimization; </li><li>  Oracle administration skills; </li><li>  Development skills in Oracle APEX; </li><li>  English is sufficient for reading documentation, conversational will be a plus; </li><li>  Knowledge of the subject area of ‚Äã‚Äãtrading and securities accounting will be a big plus; </li></ul><br>  Send letters and resume to <a href="">job@iticapital.ru</a> . <br></div></div><br>  A separate and rather large layer of projects is the development of mobile applications for online trading.  ITI Capital has its own <a href="https://iticapital.ru/software/mobile/">mobile applications</a> - earlier we <a href="https://habr.com/ru/company/iticapital/blog/254755/">talked</a> about the evolution of the interfaces of these terminals from the beginning of the 2000s to the present day. <br><br><h2>  What projects can you work on </h2><br>  The easiest way to understand what projects can be encountered in the field of finance, considering real examples.  For example, we at ITI Capital are developing our own trading system <a href="https://iticapital.ru/software/">MATRIX</a> , the <a href="https://iticapital.ru/software/smartx-terminal/about/">SMARTx</a> terminal - a separate area of ‚Äã‚Äãwork is associated with optimizing its performance - is developing an API for our infrastructure called <a href="https://iticapital.ru/software/mobile/">SMARTcom</a> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/sf/ep/ia/sfepiaqzhb-hqdgdnez3ew2udqa.png" alt="image"><br><br>  <i>SMARTcom API Documentation Screenshot</i> <br><br><h2>  Conclusion </h2><br>  In the field of finance, specialists in various fields are in demand.  Here you can find work both in junior positions and become a leading expert in some interesting project. <br><br>  To summarize, then developers to work in financial companies will require knowledge of OOP and standard algorithms.  The development of client-server financial systems also goes hand in hand with multi-threaded programming.  Developers who know not only C ++, but also lower-level languages, up to assembler, are greatly appreciated. <br><br>  Systems for the financial sector are based on databases, therefore, specialists who know SQL and Oracle well are in demand.  You need to be able to work with storage procedures, deal with indexes, and various types of locks. <br><br>  Do not forget about the technological knowledge that applies specifically to the financial sector - before you look for work in a financial company (in a broker or on the stock exchange), you should study the existing data transfer protocols and related technologies. <br><br><h2>  Bonus: more IT vacancies from ITI Capital (only for Habr audience) </h2><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Head of Service Desk (Head of Technical Support)</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><h4>  Duties: </h4><br><ul><li>  Organization work of the 1st and 2nd lines of the global HelpDesk IT (London and Moscow); </li><li>  Implementation of the Service Desk system; </li><li>  Construction, control and automation of key IT processes using international practices of ITIL and MoF; </li><li>  Service Desk Management </li><li>  KPI development within the service model </li><li>  SLA development as part of a service model </li><li>  Interchangeability with the IT manager of the London office for the support of office workers in the UK </li></ul><br><h4>  Requirements: </h4><br><ul><li>  Higher technical education; </li><li>  Work experience not less than 10 years; </li><li>  Fluency in English; </li><li>  Experience in managing the technical support department; </li><li>  Experience in an international investment company; </li><li>  Experience in project management; </li><li>  Experience in conducting IT trainings for company management </li><li>  Experience in organizing IT support during various events organized by the company (for example, conferences for investors, a meeting of shareholders and so on). </li><li>  The experience of replacing a regional IT manager in an English-language office </li><li>  ITIL knowledge </li><li>  Knowledge of Microsoft Windows </li><li>  MacOS knowledge </li><li>  Service Desk Implementation Experience </li><li>  Experience in implementing IT resource management systems </li><li>  Experience in implementing and supporting corporate portal systems and electronic application systems. </li></ul><br></div></div><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">IT Security Officer</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><ul><li>  Review and development of security framework, information security policies, processes / procedures and guidelines on an ongoing basis. </li><li>  Administer compliance with these policies / procedures through ongoing security reviews and audits, not limited to log analysis and security assessment of IT systems </li><li>  Review and approve PAM (Privilege Access Management) requests </li><li>  Develop strategies to respond to and recover from security breaches </li><li>  Ensure IT and security compliance with local regulatory requirements and laws </li><li>  Identify IT security risks including IT business application and infrastructure projects </li><li>  Conduct security assessments for business application and infrastructure projects </li><li>  Undertake new security projects to improve the security controls, efficiency and ease of use </li><li>  Assist in Conducting periodic network scans, penetration testing, simulating attacks on systems to find exploitable weaknesses </li><li>  Investigate security breaches </li><li>  Support IT audits at global and branch level. </li><li>  Be the point of contact to assist and advise customers for IT security-related matters </li></ul><br><h4>  Key competencies &amp; qualifications </h4><br><ul><li>  Ideal candidate profile would be Bachelor's degree in information technology / Computer Engineering / Computer Science or related discipline </li><li>  In depth knowledge of Network firewalls, VPN &amp; Security products </li><li>  In depth knowledge in anti-virus software, intrusion detection, firewalls and content filtering </li><li>  Knowledge of risk assessment tools, technologies and methods </li><li>  Experience of vulnerability and penetration testing </li><li>  Professional Certifications: CISSP / CISM / CISA / MCSP / CCSK / CCSP is preferred </li><li>  Strong analytical and critical thinking skills and meticulous attitude. </li><li>  Able to work independently or in a team with minimal supervision </li><li>  Extensive experience in working collaboratively across global teams and to lead others through problem solving challenges. </li><li>  Strong communication skills, both verbal and written are essential. </li><li>  Previous working experience with financial organization in a similar capacity is desirable </li></ul><br></div></div><br>  Send letters with a story about yourself to <a href="">job@iticapital.ru</a> .
