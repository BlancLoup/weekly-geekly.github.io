The head of YouTube‚Äôs monetization department in 14 European countries, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/bozenarezab">Bozena Rezab,</a> did exactly that to start a Gamee startup based on an application with a selection of many mini-games based on its own social network. <br><br>  In the first stage, <a href="https://www.gameeapp.com/">Gamee</a> received an investment of $ 600,000 back in 2015 from her husband, the founder of Socialbakers, Jan Rezab.  The main goal of Gamee is to fill users' free time, which they spend while watching ads on TV, waiting for the bus at the station and other similar points. <a name="habracut"></a>

      Since the launch of the Gamee platform, more than 100 thousand players and 32 different games have been collected, but Bozhena‚Äôs plans are to add something new every week.  All activity in the Gamee is built around the news feed, formed on the basis of information about the achievements of users in games. <br><br><blockquote>  ‚ÄúSome say that people never quit Google.‚Äù  You are either fired or you are crazy.  So I went crazy and went to play games at work. <br><br>  We do not focus on serious projects, instead we pay attention to those in which you can dive in a few seconds and just as easily get out of them.  You can play at any time and without any time limits.  With this in mind, players spend on a Gamee about 25 minutes a day.  This is how to scroll Facebook or Twitter feeds. <br><br>  Gamee may be the only application you need for casual games.  All of the games run on the network, so you do not need free memory on the device for them. <br><br>  We want to become an Instagram for games and gain a million users, ‚Äùsaid Bozena Rezab. </blockquote><br><br>  But the most interesting of all is Bozhena‚Äôs attitude towards the monetization of modern projects - in her opinion, existing solutions in the form of payment for extra lives only destroy the gameplay.  Instead, she wants to use a new kind of native advertising and create branded games.  The total profit from such projects is unknown, but the cost of the branded game is approximately $ 55 thousand. <br><br>  In total, about 150 developers are registered with Gamee - the number is relatively small, especially for the young platform.  But with competent interaction with developers, you can achieve a constant flow of new applications.  Attracting new developers is possible only at the expense of the user base, which is still gaining momentum.  It is worth noting that while the number of app ratings in <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details%3Fid%3Dcom.gameeapp.android.app">Google Play</a> and the <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/gamee-play-win-share!/id945638210%3Fmt%3D8">App Store</a> suggests the existence of a relatively small base of active and loyal users.  The potential of Gamee is still difficult to assess - if the project can find a potential audience, then we can talk about the subsequent growth, but for now the social network of the Czech businesswoman is too early to evaluate. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/298840/">https://habr.com/ru/post/298840/</a></p>
