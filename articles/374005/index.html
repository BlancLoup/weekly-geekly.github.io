But simulators always showed themselves well in another: they allowed people to control equipment worth many millions of dollars. <br><br><h3>  Learn to fly </h3><br>  Flight simulators in various forms existed even before the invention of the microcomputer, but never really entered the amateur market, at least in any complex form.  That was before the creation of Bruce Artvik at the end of 1979 <em>Flight Simulator</em> . <br><br>  Given the computing power of personal computers of the time, the first version of <em>Flight Simulator</em> inevitably had to become simple, with tile-based graphics, braking frame rates and a rudimentary instrument panel that occupied half of the screen.  But over the following years, it has evolved significantly, especially after the rights to the game from the company ArtLick's subLOGIC in 1982 were licensed by Microsoft. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The game gradually increased the quality of graphics, created more accurate simulations and increased depth, including adding new game modes and flying machines (of all forms and kinds), as well as user-generated content (which was originally introduced through hacks, and then began to be officially supported in the release 1989 <em>Microsoft Flight Simulator 4.0</em> ).

The flight was accompanied by comments from Yeager himself - sometimes useful, sometimes motivating, often entertaining. <br><br>  In 1990, SubLOGIC released its first <em>Flight Assignment: ATP</em> simulator after <em>Flight Simulator</em> , making an application for the role of the first company simulating the work of civil airlines, including the rudimentary implementation of air traffic control. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/013/34d/867/01334d8672a028e8652adf73a261143a.jpg"></div><br>  <i>SubLOGIC <em>ATP</em></i> <br><br>  Among other notable non-combat simulators were <em>Flight Unlimited</em> (1995), in which ground textures overtook their time and gas dynamics were introduced for the first time instead of direct control of aircraft movements, as well as <em>X-Plane</em> , which was not a game, but rather a complete medium of a flight simulator, allows you to fully customize the map, the environment, the plane, the user interface and more. <br><br>  By the end of the century, <em>Flight Simulator</em> became so deep and detailed that novice pilots could use it for training.  In the 2002 version, an aircraft with artificial intelligence was added, complicating the air routes and communication with airports, and a three-dimensional virtual cockpit was introduced.  This further reduced the gap between the experience of piloting a virtual aircraft and flights on the present. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/70a/e5b/4fa/70ae5b4fa0825dc8d9120d240bdec6b1.jpg"></div><br>  <em>Flight Simulator 2002</em> <br><br><h3>  Highway to the danger zone </h3><br>  While <em>Flight Simulator</em> and <em>ATP</em> (and later <em>X-Plane</em> ) proved to be mandatory for civil aviation amateurs, there were others who added a bit more interest.  Before the advent of first-person shooters, combat flight simulators made it possible to experience an incredibly exciting experience of fights and first-person skirmishes. <br><br>  Notable combat flight simulators include <em>Fighter Pilot</em> (1984) from Digital Integration, <em>Jet</em> (1985) from subLOGIC, and <em>F-15 Strike Eagle</em> (1985) from MicroProse.  All of them suffered greatly from technical limitations.  The <em>Falcon</em> series began in 1984 with the <em>F-16 Fighting Falcon</em> for MSX, but "took off" only after the release of the <em>Falcon</em> in 1987 for the Macintosh: raster graphics, detailing and realism became the hallmark of the series.  Amiga users could try the exclusive <em>F / A-18 Interceptor</em> release (1988), which used the unusual entourage of the San Francisco Bay Area;  The game was recognized as the best flight simulator for the Amiga. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/ad1/7cc/ba8/ad17ccba8ca916fb317c7c4b5b6314d7.jpg"></div><br>  <i><em>F / A-18 Interceptor</em> connected arcade control with realism simulator.</i> <br><br>  While the <em>Falcon</em> series continued to increase realism, Dynamix and Electronic Arts sought to make combat flight simulators accessible and interesting for players: they released <em>Red Baron</em> (1990) and <em>Chuck Yeager's Air Combat</em> (1991). <br><br>  The <em>Red Baron</em> used exclusively fighters of the First World War.  The game allowed to participate in close combat and in several other types of missions, and despite the simplified physics, it had a simulation of gyroscopes, jamming of weapons and damage to airplanes.  <em>Air Combat</em> also sacrificed realism to a more interesting gameplay, but retained enough physical simulations so that the game did not feel like an arcade game. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/4ac/1f6/bb6/4ac1f6bb6a09dc2220879cb9c6b96953.jpg"></div><br>  <i>Close air combat was the strength of the <em>Red Baron</em> .</i> <br><br>  Electronic Arts competed in realism with the <em>Falcon</em> series of games released under the brand name Jane's Combat Simulations, the first of which was <em>Advanced Tactical Fighters</em> (1996).  But the best combat flight simulator was developed by former aviation engineer Oleg Maddox and his Maddox Games team. <br><br>  <em>IL-2 Attack</em> , a simulator in the subject of the Second World War, named after the Soviet fighter-attack aircraft, after a long development cycle was released in late 2001 and quickly made a name for itself in the gaming community.  Maddox realized that the computing power of computers required compromises, but he still adhered to the desire to create as detailed as possible physics, while maintaining good graphics and AI.  The result was the most reliable flight simulator on the market, at least until the first sequel appeared in 2003, <em>Forgotten Battles</em> .  Somehow, the developers managed to create a sense of lack of control: the player barely kept the plane in the air, he was tormented by gravity, powerful gusts of wind and a strong torque. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/665/4de/e5f/6654dee5fc052ea425763cd9fc2e4ea2.jpg"></div><br>  <i>The game <em>IL-2 Sturmovik</em> , despite the deep simulation of the Second World War fighters, managed to create good graphics.</i> <br><br>  The game attracted a keen and knowledgeable community that created high-quality mods and helped developers fine-tune parts, even engine performance at different heights and simulate individual cylinders.  (However, novices were <em>not</em> excluded from participating in the fun - to create a more casual gameplay, realism could be reduced.) <em>IL-2 Assault: The Battle of Britain</em> , the sixth part of the series, was released in 2011, and provided even more realism, complexity and extended content that have become the hallmark of the series. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/358/3a2/0cf/3583a20cf68a32bcd89c75cea41ccd55.jpg"></div><br>  <i>Series <em>IL-2 Attacker</em> does not give up the slack, impressing us with every new part.</i> <br><br><h3>  Send a helicopter </h3><br>  <em>Tomahawk</em> (1985) of Digital Integration, <em>Gunship</em> (1986) and <em>Apache Strike</em> (1987) MicroProse Software were among the first helicopter simulators.  These games resembled simulators of jet and combat aircraft of the time: the player looked at the action from the cockpit, controlling speed, direction and altitude, shooting at targets from various weapons.  Each game used its own type of helicopter (usually a variation of the AH-64 Apache) and offered a series of missions, each of which had several ground and air targets.  Although the physical systems at that time were still forcedly simple, these early helicopter simulators, compared to other air battles simulators, gave the player a different game pace - the helicopter‚Äôs flight has other difficulties: it flies and fights close to the ground, and in combat it sometimes has to hover on the spot, fly sideways or back. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/cc1/1a7/79e/cc11a779e7f068c107200d0ad2bf0671.jpg"></div><br>  <i><em>Gunship</em> - one of the first helicopter simulators.</i> <br><br>  In 1992, NovaLogic <em>Comanche: Maximum Overkill made</em> the most of the power of computer graphics.  Simulation aspects were not so vividly expressed - despite the stated ‚Äúmost realistic helicopter simulation‚Äù of that time, they were abandoned to demonstrate the capabilities of the engine, which used <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2592%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BA%25D1%2581%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BB">voxel technology</a> , which created a much more detailed relief than the vector or raster graphics of competitors.  The game was interesting and full of action, but fans of the true simulator helicopter battles had to wait a few more years. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/d38/237/e49/d38237e49b64abfa9e2b0c02a7f4d73e.jpg"></div><br>  <i><em>Comanche</em> had incredible graphics at the time.</i> <br><br>  With the release of <em>Apache</em> (aka <em>Apache Longbow</em> ) in 1995, Digital Integration showed how far technology had gone in ten years after the release of <em>Tomahawk</em> .  Although the graphics of the game seemed weak compared to the <em>Comanche</em> series, <em>Apache</em> had a deep and realistic simulation mode, fortunately provided with a detailed workout mode.  However, he retained the title of the most realistic helicopter simulator for only about a year - in 1996, Origin Systems laid out <em>AH-64D Longbow</em> on store shelves.  <em>Longbow</em> defeated <em>Apache</em> on all fronts - it had a terrific graphics schedule, superb leadership, difficulty changing, hyper-realistic simulation of an Apache attack helicopter, a system of various missions, intelligent AI, and two full campaigns.  For all this, we had to pay performance - for a normal <em>Longbow</em> operation a very powerful machine was required. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/507/129/64f/50712964ff760b73196ffd7ecf5fa043.jpg"></div><br>  <i><em>AH-64D Longbow</em> is still one of the most realistic helicopter simulators.</i> <br><br>  More modern helicopter simulators, such as <em>Apache Longbow Assault</em> (2004) and <em>DCS: Black Shark</em> (2009), continued to develop innovations of these games, they became more realistic, added new functions and new models of helicopters.  Helicopters began to appear in some other flight simulators, such as <em>Flight Simulator</em> and <em>X-Plane</em> , but over the past decade, nothing truly innovative happened in the helicopter simulator genre. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/57c/47f/baa/57c47fbaab3fe47c30ac0db8a90e7dc4.jpg"></div><br>  <em>DCS: Black Shark</em> <br><br><h3>  Lost in space </h3><br>  The concept of interstellar trading, very important in games such as <em>Freelancer</em> , <em>Wing Commander: Privateer</em> and <em>EVE Online</em> , first appeared in the 1974 <em>Star Trader</em> game written on BASIC.  In it, the player moved on a star map, choosing trade routes.  <em>Star Raiders</em> (1979) chose a more militant approach, adding a first-person perspective to the game.  But the concept itself gained popularity only a decade later.  Space simulators and, to a lesser extent, open-world games owe much to <em>Elite</em> Ian Bell and David Braben. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/11b/cbd/df3/11bcbddf3356b2c3b9c34776f8cd0bf1.jpg"></div><br>  <i><em>Star Raiders is</em> well remembered by those who played in it.</i> <br><br>  <em>Elite</em> , first released in 1984 for the BBC Micro home computer available only in the UK, gave players the opportunity to become the commander of a merchant ship in a huge universe (the contents of which were stored algorithmically).  By participating in various enterprises, including piracy, mining and military missions, as well as trading, the player earned money that could be spent on improving the ship and buying a new one.  <em>Elite</em> structure was completely open.  Most of all in it attracted the same thing as in many subsequent space simulators: the ability to move anywhere, do anything within a very deep gameplay system and a huge universe. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/cb1/c21/eda/cb1c21eda2c08bb595236b02ba9be0b1.jpg"></div><br>  <i><em>Elite</em> on BBC Micro</i> <br><br>  It was followed by several mediocre clones and excellent ports, as well as less simulator and more arcade games about space battles, while the genre of space simulator experienced stagnation.  Everything changed in the early 90s, the genre began to grow rapidly, and many owed it to the birth of a legend. <br><br>  The popular <em>Wing Commander</em> series by Chris Roberts and Origin appeared in 1990.  The first game of the series took the <em>Star Wars</em> formula, mixing drama with terrific space battles and transforming them into a video game format.  The high quality of the game made it possible to defeat all competitors: almost cinematic plot, impressive graphics, which delayed the player in the game world, arcade-style battles and a dynamic soundtrack.  However, many believe that <em>Wing Commander</em> (and its sequels) was not a ‚Äúreal‚Äù simulator: it was something like a Hollywood version of a simulator that <em>seemed</em> more important to <em>be</em> realistic or reliable (for an inexperienced player). <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/2a7/79f/d49/2a779fd49435a0e20b1e00a68a360eab.jpg"></div><br>  <em>Wing commader</em> <br><br>  With the <em>launch</em> of the LucasArts <em>X-Wing</em> project in 1993, the <i>Star Wars</i> franchise finally gave its <em>Wing Commander</em> series of responses in the form of a video game.  <em>X-Wing</em> spawned three sequels, each of which became more and more like a simulator, and seriously competed with <em>Wing Commander</em> in sales, and in reviews of critics.  <em>X-Wing</em> and its sequels, playing in the game exciting battles from <i>Star Wars</i> films, have a lot of fans. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/d2b/b0d/644/d2bb0d6442b58d207f35a07bb9dedc8d.jpg"></div><br>  <i><em>X-Wing</em> today is one of the best video game adaptations of the <em>Star Wars</em> franchise.</i> <br><br>  Technological advantages allowed <em>Escape Velocity</em> (1996) to become the game that <em>Elite</em> could not become due to the limitations of memory and graphics.  Despite its two-dimensionality, it was huge - an ever-expanding star map, filled with a mixture of everything and nothing, conveying the vastness of space better than any other game before it.  But the game was released only for Macintosh, and this platform was ignored by many lovers of space simulators. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/cef/835/978/cef83597822e589610da41ee5501be44.jpg"></div><br>  <i>In <em>Escape Velocity, a</em> player could communicate with other pilots of ships, communicate with the nearest planets and space stations.</i> <br><br>  It‚Äôs not that the <em>Elite-</em> inspired space simulator alternatives were bad - <em>Wing Commander: Privateer</em> (1993) and its sequel <em>Privateer 2</em> (1996) added the open world and elements of commerce to the <em>Wing Commander</em> cinematic storyline.  These games, like most space simulators, had a steep learning curve - players had to learn to juggle several types of camera, screen radar, difficult controls (there was almost nothing to do without a joystick) and a variety of tasks.  But everything was presented so well that for several years the genre of space simulators proudly towered on the PC-games market. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/44d/2fe/62e/44d2fe62e9b4fd11a704cf6af367219c.jpg"></div><br>  <i>Today, <em>Wing Commander: Privateer</em> remains one of the favorite space simulators.</i> <br><br>  Even despite the fact that the popularity of first-person shooters and consoles ousted simulators - and especially space simulators - into the background, the genre of space simulator continued to impress.  <em>Descent: FreeSpace</em> ( <em>Conflict: FreeSpace ‚Äî The Great War</em> in Europe) and its sequel to <em>FreeSpace 2</em> are considered the two best space simulators because they more or less brought to the state of the ideal space trade and open world fights .  New <em>FreeSpace 2</em> mods are being actively developed to this day (thanks to the work of the <em>FreeSpace 2 Source Code Project,</em> fan-driven).  Some of them, including <em>Beyond the Red Line</em> , <em>Shadows of Lylat</em> , and <em>The Babylon Project,</em> have become complete conversions, expanded gameplay and replaced graphics and other content. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/3e2/6e2/4c3/3e26e24c3df14b8ac6f944882456c189.jpg"></div><br>  <i><em>FreeSpace 2</em> is considered the most cosmic simulator by most players.</i>  <i>This screenshot was taken in the Blue Planet mod.</i> <br><br><h3>  In depth </h3><br>  Today, submarine simulators, or ‚Äúsubsims,‚Äù as the fans call them, survive in the face of open-source <em>Danger from the Deep</em> and the frankly complex <em>Silent Hunter</em> series (and possibly <em>Steel Diver</em> for the Nintendo 3DS, if it manages to build a similar fan base ).  But once the market of underwater simulators was much more alive.  The first in 1982 for the Intellivision console was Mattel's <em>Sub Hunt</em> , followed by Spectrum Holobyte's <em>GATO</em> .  <em>Sub Hunt</em> gave players the ability to control four submarines (one at a time), which were supposed to prevent or stop the invasion of the player‚Äôs home island.  This was implemented in two game modes: Deployment mode allowed submarines to move orders before meeting with the enemy, after which the game went into combat mode - view from the skip and sonar screen, with which you could control the depth, speed and position of the steering wheel, as well as release torpedoes (with an infinite supply). <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/659/40f/0e8/65940f0e8affae615d4113e15eb804ed.jpg"></div><br>  <i>Battle Mode <em>Sub Hunt</em></i> <br><br>  However, the most important submarine simulator of the 80s was Sid Meier's <em>Silent Service</em> .  Taking as its basis the utterly clich√©d entourage of the Second World War, but the less clich√©d Pacific theater of military operations, <em>Silent Service</em> contained detailed instructions with information about historical combat tactics and their effectiveness.  And the game itself was as attentive to the details as its leadership. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/6e7/212/f14/6e7212f14810c55f40fdb0acf36cffcd.jpg"></div><br>  <i>DOS version of <em>Silent Service</em></i> <br><br><h3>  Shut up and drive </h3><br>  Almost everyone at some point in life had to drive a car, and naturally there are simulators that allow you to drive in the virtual world.  The standard of driving makes them unique among vehicle simulators because they rarely simply recreate the process of driving a car through country roads or in a city ‚Äî the player needs the tension of high speeds, the novelty of exotic locations or the feeling of being driving a luxury car, a huge truck, a racing car or even a policeman car. <br><br>  Racing simulators are much better explored in the wider context of all racing games, but nevertheless they remain simulators - so I will briefly describe their evolution.  The success of the game for arcade machines <em>Pole Position</em> (1982) from both developers and consumers has an interest in games that accurately simulate the driving experience in Formula 1 and other types of professional racing.  In 1985, the <em>Hang-On</em> motorcycle appeared on the arcade machines: the players would sit on real motorcycle mockups, which could be tilted from side to side, driving.  But the true simulation of racing began only with the release of the company Papyrus <em>Indianapolis 500</em> in 1990.  Throughout the 1990s, Papyrus improved its formula for unsurpassed racing realism, breaking sales records for stunning <em>NASCAR Racing</em> (1994), setting the standard for all other simulators and paving the way for other popular simulators such as <em>Gran Turismo</em> (1997).  In the meantime, MicroProse managed to attract the attention of the racing community with the <em>Grand Prix 2</em> game (1996), a highly realistic Formula One simulator with excellent customization of cars.  The 1998 Papyrus <em>Grand Prix Legends</em> game surpassed everyone else in terms of realism, presenting the unusual entourage of the 1967 Formula 1 season, but scared the fans with high technical requirements and terrible complexity. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/d17/ee5/a73/d17ee5a737dfc169ecdda14e5558ca8b.jpg"></div><br>  <i>The impressive damage modeling of <em>NASCAR Racing</em> made the crashes interesting ... but destroyed hopes of victory.</i> <br><br>  Console races were mostly represented by arcade games, until in 1997 Polyphony Digital released the PlayStation <em>Gran Turismo</em> for Sony.  Incredible detailing and the open <em>Gran Turismo</em> open final were compromised only by the lack of damage modeling.  But this did not reduce sales - the <em>Gran Turismo series</em> , in which five main parts appeared, has sold more than 60 million copies worldwide.  Later, she had competitors in the face of the <em>GTR</em> and <em>Forza</em> series, various Formula 1 and rally simulators (the most prominent were the <em>Colin McRae</em> / <em>Dirt</em> series) and <em>Live for Speed</em> online racing simulators. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/383/651/494/3836514941be5c3981a1777e9abdf09e.jpg"></div><br>  <em>Live for speed</em> <br><br>  In the non-driving category of driving simulators, there was a little remarkable - probably the developers were afraid to take risks while making a commercial driving game, not related to racing.  Truck simulators, for example, a series of <em>18 Wheels of Steel</em> were produced with low budgets, received mediocre sales and occupied very narrow niches.  There were very few other games on the market.  <em>Hard Drivin '</em> (1988) with realistic driving physics in a fantastic environment with huge loops of tracks most likely became the first (and most successful) driving simulator without racing. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/e9f/1fb/2aa/e9f1fb2aa3f2ecc3984b463dedc37b15.jpg"></div><br>  <em>18 Wheels of Steel Extreme Trucker</em> . <br><br><h3>  Fighting on mechanized and armored vehicles </h3><br>  Considering the fact that tanks are able to blow up everything, it is difficult to understand why they do not participate in more simulators.  Of course, one cannot say that there are no tank simulators at all.  Arcade games <em>Tank</em> (1974) and <em>Battlezone</em> (1980) can be considered the first such games, although in both of them there was not so much simulator.  A more serious attempt was made in 1989 with the release of <em>M1 Tank Platoon</em> , in which an unusual 3D landscape appeared for that time.  The game allowed you to switch between direct control of several pieces of equipment, each of which was under the command of a player.  The console game <em>Super Battletank</em> (1992) combines elements of simulation and action.  The main role in the game was played by the tank division participating in the operation ‚ÄúDesert Storm‚Äù.  Tank simulators went into the shadows before the 1998 release of <em>M1 Tank Platoon II</em> , which was soon followed by <em>iM1A2 Abrams</em> and the popular <em>Steel Beasts</em> which defined the genre. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/a97/517/3e2/a975173e2a72d3bcfe865e77a359aa07.jpg"></div><br>  <i><em>Steel Beasts Pro PE</em> is the most modern version of <em>Steel Beasts</em></i> . <br><br>  <em>Steel Beasts</em> gave the player the opportunity to perform the role of one of the crew members (for example, commander, gunner or driver) of a tank or other armored combat vehicles.  The game features intelligent AI, authentic sounds, realistic action, popular themes, a map editor, and multiplayer game modes.  The game developer, eSim Games, even developed a version of <em>Steel Beasts</em> specifically for military training.  Meanwhile, a team MMO <em>World of Tanks</em> was released, the developers of which apparently hoped to capitalize on the success of eSim Games.  The game features a fairly accurate simulation of about 500 vehicles, most of which are tanks. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/e42/aa2/e0c/e42aa2e0c2e7c5f5729305d4488b678e.jpg"></div><br>  <i>Free MMO <em>World of Tanks</em> quickly gained popularity.</i> <br><br>  Futuristic pro-combat games involving armored or mechanized units tended to be more prone to action / arcade or RPG than to the simulation genre.  Of the several mech simulators (think of a walking tank!), The most visible were the <em>Armored Core</em> series (1997 and on), <em>MechWarrior</em> (1989 and on), <em>Steel Battalion</em> , together with the <em>Front Mission</em> series more focused on RPG (1995 and on) .  These games featured a wide range of gameplay styles, even within the same series.  But common to them were the modularity of the parts, which had certain tasks and internal systems, a noticeable influence of the <em>BattleTech</em> wargame and anime. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/20e/b23/3ed/20eb233ed39e746be8b7b1cd113757fa.jpg"></div><br> <i><em><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">MechWarrior 2</font></font></em><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> is probably the first mech simulator (the first </font></font><em><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">MechWarrior</font></font></em><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> was more like a clean action).</font></font></i> <br><br><h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> On rails </font></font></h3><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Those who like trains should not stop at transport managers like </font></font><em><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Railroad Tycoon</font></font></em><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> and </font></font><em><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Transport Tycoon</font></font></em><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> ; </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">special railway simulators have existed for a long time already, in which trains themselves play a central role. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Such games gained their popularity even in the face of early train simulators, for example, </font></font><em><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Southern Belle</font></font></em><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> (1985), which critics considered dull and meaningless.</font></font><br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/09e/2ce/9d4/09e2ce9d4f1e201a10a8c0c63fad1431.jpg"></div><br> <i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It's hard to find a less interesting game than </font></font><em><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Southern Belle.</font></font></em></i> <br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> Today, train train simulators are dominated by the </font></font><em><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Microsoft Train Simulator</font></font></em><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> / </font></font><em><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Rail Simulator</font></font></em><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> / </font></font><em><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Railworks</font></font></em><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> and </font></font><em><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Trainz</font></font></em><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> series </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">, founded in 2001.

Starting with two inexperienced developers and empty pockets, the studio gradually turns into a large whale industry. Despite the simplicity of the gameplay and the superficiality of the simulation, the game impressed with the accuracy of its parody of all aspects of the industry (at least in the early stages) and became an excellent example of the fact that the business simulator does not have to be difficult to entertain the player and teach him to manage people, money and other resources.</font></font><br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/eec/6b7/457/eec6b7457879718dc28be76681c919e0.jpg"></div><br> <i>,            ¬´  ¬ª?</i> <br><br><h3>    </h3><br>  Medical simulators soared to the peak of popularity in 2005, after the release of the <em>Trauma Center: Under the Knife</em> for the Nintendo DS.  <em>Trauma Center</em> told the linear (and ridiculous) story of Dr. Derek Stiles, who wants to save the world with her newfound ‚Äúhealing touch‚Äù.  The main attraction of the game was its pseudo-realistic surgical operations, the origins of which seem to lie in the 1988 simulator <em>Life &amp; Death</em> .  <em>Life &amp; Death,</em> much more realistic than the <em>Trauma Center</em> (but still remaining a yoke), turned the player into an abdominal surgeon who needed to diagnose and treat patients at Toolworks General Hospital.  Irresponsible decisions or erroneous views could become a matter of life and death for patients.  With every mistake, the protagonist was sent to the class, where they read a lecture about what he did wrong.  In the sequel, <em>Life &amp; Death 2: The Brain</em> , improved graphics and deeper (but otherwise similar) gameplay appeared, only this time the player was a neurosurgeon.  The list of other games with a hospital theme includes <em>Hospital Tycoon</em> (2007) and <em>Theme Hospital</em> (1997), in which the player managed the hospital and its staff. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/ce4/fe7/0f1/ce4fe70f12b05c55ab7d4c31c63bc79e.jpg"></div><br>  <i>It seems that when a patient is consciously cut with a scalpel, it hurts him.</i> <br><br><h3>  Casual vs Hardcore </h3><br>  The terms "casual" and "hardcore" got a new meaning in the simulators - they relate more to the level of realism, and not the depth of the gameplay.  The casual simulator is similar to the ‚Äúsimulator-lite‚Äù - availability in it is valued above accuracy, and its learning curve is much simpler than that of hardcore.  It can still have a considerable depth of settings and possibilities, but such depth is not required to enjoy the game.  Most simulators released in the 80s and early 90s would be considered casual today, because they are much simpler than the games that they were inspired by. <br><br>  This is one of the biggest problems in making a simulator popular today.  Games of the genre are mainly divided by levels of detail and realism.  There is a strong motivation to make simulators more real, more life-like and more complex.  But at some point it scared the genre of its casual lovers.  Only the most committed players are willing to spend long hours studying management before they can take the plane to the runway or build a city with a working ‚Äî even not necessarily efficiently ‚Äî transport system. <br><br>  The race for specialization and the race for realism took place in parallel and both of them led to the escape of mainstream players.  (And the surplus of primitive games that appeared in the late 90s and continues to this day also did not help simulators.) <br><br><h3>  Where to go next? </h3><br>  Although many video games over the past decade have become easier, now they are more friendly to beginners, but at the same time other games have improved their ‚Äúhardcore‚Äù functions - simulators have become more and more complex and complex.  There were exceptions to this trend, and not only in the areas of browser and mobile games, but such exceptions are usually just alterations to old games.  The work of the indie community, striving for hyper-realistic and complex simulators, preserving the fascination of old games, is invaluable for the future of simulators. <br><br>  But there is also a huge need for a new hit at the intersection of audiences, especially in the increasingly niche genres of the space and flight simulator.  You need something like <em>The Sims</em> , <em>Wing Commander</em> , <em>Red Baron</em> , <em>RollerCoaster Tycoon</em> , <em>Theme Park</em> , <em>NASCAR Racing,</em> or even <em>Populous</em> .  Without such a hit, simulators (with the possible exception of <em>The Sims</em> and other life simulators) seem doomed to niche status.  It is quite suitable for games such as <em>Farming Simulator</em> or <em>Ship Simulator</em> , but will not work for games like <em>Tropico</em> , <em>Cities XL</em> or <em>Forza</em> , which are not attractive for the mainstream and have a high production cost. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/b4f/379/a4c/b4f379a4c4b3e564f096d45d0e649b1d.jpg"></div><br>  <i>If this is the future of simulators, many people will be disappointed (although some will be delighted)</i> . <br><br>  At one time, the omnipotent space simulators especially needed a breakthrough hit, the genre completely disappeared from the radar screens of former fans, who gradually switched to console games.  This is still true even after the appearance of the incredibly deep (and moderately popular) <em>EVE Online</em> , in which the economy is so complex that there are economists in the development team, and after the release of <em>Star Trek Online</em> MMO in the <em>Star Trek</em> universe. <br><br>  Games like <em>Grand Theft Auto</em> have been replaced by space simulators for those who like to explore the vast open world, but the fact that such games are popular, combined with the enduring passion of humanity for space, tells us that there can still be a place in the world for games like <em>FreeSpace</em> <em>Elite</em> , <em>Privateer</em> and <em>Escape Velocity</em> , if only developers can find the right balance between depth, accessibility and an attractive appearance. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/374005/">https://habr.com/ru/post/374005/</a></p>
