We wondered what our users think about love.  We armed ourselves with a <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/mailru/blog/110358/">methodology for analyzing long-term logs</a> , which we talked about a month ago and found, for example, that pick-up leads to a wedding 30% faster than classic dating.  And we were able to calculate how many people get married "according to circumstances", and how many - to love.  Or what are the chances that your holiday romance will end in a serious relationship.  Or is it worth going with the girl to the theater immediately after they met. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  It turned out that 80% of all search queries with the word ‚Äúlove‚Äù were women: <br><br><img src="http://content.foto.mail.ru/corp/starov/_blogs/i-35.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  While 55% of queries with the word ‚Äúsex‚Äù are men.

Romanticism is important to them and mysticism is not alien: requests about fortune-telling and conspiracies are popular. <br><br><img src="http://content.foto.mail.ru/corp/starov/_blogs/i-38.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Men, on the contrary, are more resolute and down to earth.  They are interested in how to make love, love confessions and SMS.  Separately, we note the request of men for "demotivators of love." <br><br><h1>  Dating and pickup lead to a wedding </h1><br>  In the last part of the study, we analyzed the long-term interdependencies between user requests and built interesting graphs. <br><br>  Horizontal - delayed time, vertical - the level of interest.  In the center - the day when the user first made a request. <br>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/mailru/blog/110358/">Read more about the research methodology.</a> <br><br>  <i>Dating, poetry, theater, wedding</i> <br><br><img src="http://content.foto.mail.ru/corp/starov/_blogs/i-42.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  1. Poems <br>  Interest in poetry and poetry rises sharply as soon as users become interested in the topic of acquaintances, remains at an elevated level for another 3 months on average, but as soon as acquaintances flow into something more serious, and think about the wedding, interest in the lyrics drops noticeably. <br><br>  2. Theater <br>  Judging by the results of the study, people prefer to go to the theater alone or with friends.  Lonely people have more free time and their interest in leisure in the theater is increased.  But as soon as they begin to search for acquaintances and acquire a couple, interest in the theater weakens, only slightly rising during the period of courtship (about two months after the acquaintance).  However, after the relationship becomes more serious, the theater, a couple thinking about the wedding, is not interesting. <br><br>  3. Wedding <br>  Request a wedding behaves in relation to dating is very logical.  Interest in this word is much lower, before a person searches for ‚Äúacquaintances", remains at a rather low level as long as the "candy-bouquet" period lasts (up to 3-4 months).  But when the couple decides to move to a more serious relationship, the schedule of interest in the wedding soars upward. <br><br>  <i>Pickup, essay and wedding</i> <br><br><img src="http://content.foto.mail.ru/corp/starov/_blogs/i-44.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  1. Abstract. <br>  A long-term analysis of a pair of requests ‚ÄúPickup and Abstracts‚Äù fully confirms the well-known phrase ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to learn, I want to get married!‚Äù.  As soon as a young man or girl begins to be interested in a pickup truck, the level of interest in the essays flies down rapidly. <br><br>  2. Wedding. <br>  Judging by the statistics, no matter how strange it may be, but a pick-up truck leads to a wedding faster than classic dating.  (And this is with the myth of the windiness of this phenomenon).  If people who are looking for classic acquaintances show interest in a wedding only after 150 days (5 months), then in the case of a pickup, they start thinking about the wedding after 3 months (100 days), which means pickup is 30% more efficient and leads faster to the formation of new married couples. <br><br>  <i>Wedding, rest, pregnancy, horoscope</i> <br><br><img src="http://content.foto.mail.ru/corp/starov/_blogs/i-43.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  1.Rest <br>  As for the request ‚ÄúRest, the peak of the first wave falls on 60 days before the first request of the wedding‚Äù (obviously, people get acquainted during the rest, and then, after a couple of months, they decide to legalize the relationship).  The next time they think about the rest on average six months after the ‚Äúwedding‚Äù. <br><br>  2. Horoscopes. <br>  Interest in horoscopes increased long before the interest in the wedding (250 days).  Then, when people think about the wedding for the first time, for about a week they try to check their choice with the help of compatibility ‚Äúhoroscopes‚Äù, get married and completely lose interest in this topic. <br><br>  3. Pregnancy. <br>  Judging by the results of a study of long-term dependencies of user requests, interest in queries with the word ‚Äúpregnancy‚Äù first rises sharply along with interest in the ‚Äúwedding‚Äù (obviously, this is the first wave related to the fact that pregnancy can cause interest in the wedding), and the second wave a sharp increase in interest in ‚Äúpregnancy‚Äù occurs on average after 60 days (2 months), from the time when the user first entered the query with the word ‚Äúwedding‚Äù in the search box. <br><br>  Search Team@Mail.ru </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/114063/">https://habr.com/ru/post/114063/</a></p>
