      <b>1. Newsletter.</b> <br><br>  You will be connected to the list of accepted students.  Through this sheet of Google, and more specifically Carol Smith, will inform you about important events.  Sometimes it seems to me that this is not a human being, but a biorobot - very much it promptly answers all student questions. <br><br>  In the distant dark time, students are very much spammed in this sheet.  Those.  as soon as China woke up, the Chinese wrote ‚Äúhello, my name is like that, and I code such and such a project‚Äù.  Then India woke up, and already the Indians wrote ‚Äúhello world‚Äù.  Then everyone else woke up, and the abuse about these letters began.  200 letters in the morning was quite an ordinary picture.  And letters from your community, and, God forbid, you still have a couple of sheets connected.  But now, it seems, people have calmed down and do not swear at spam, and do not spam themselves.  Even if a student wants to talk with the rest of the 1,000 students, no one pays attention to him, and he calms down.  If you want to talk, you have your community, IRC and your mentor.  They will be glad to you. <br><br>  Old students who have successfully completed the project are not disconnected from the newsletter.  Google believes they can share their experiences with new members. <br><br>  <b>National newsletter.</b> <br><br>  Every year, students create their national lists.  If among the general letters you saw an invitation to the Russian-speaking community - connect.  It will be fun. <br><br>  <b>2. Documents.</b> <br><br>  In the section My Dashboard-&gt; TODO there will be 4 items.  The first two are very important. <br>  Tax form - a piece of paper on which you sign, confirming that you do not live in the United States and you do not have to pay her taxes.  Google is only interested in taxes in the US, how you will pay taxes in your country - your problems.  An electronic version of this document will be sent to you by Carol, print it, sign it, scan it, and post it. <br>  Enrollment form - scan document confirming that you are a student.  A student or certificate from a university that you are a student and your graduation will be then.  The document must be translated.  If you are in doubt and you have a bad scan of a student or ID card (I had it that way, because my university wrote everything by hand like a chicken with its paw), then just post it.  Do not like it - they will tell you.  They said nothing - it means everything is fine. <br><br>  If you hold out with these documents, then you just do not charge money.  The card will be sent, but the money will not be there.  Post documents and money will appear on your account.  One was a gifted student who forgot to post documents and remembered them at the end of June.  Nothing, the money was transferred to him.  But it is better not to do so - and then suddenly you will need help, and everything in your university is already on leave and you will not receive the signature of the right person. <br><br>  <b>Which documents?</b> <br><br>  Most often a certificate from your university that you study and your training ends then.  If you are a graduate student, then help in the department of graduate school.  If you are studying on the ‚Äúlast‚Äù course, i.e.  4 and you can not give help that you will be a master (at 6 - that you will be a graduate student) - then you are still legitimate.  Help that you study until the end of June will be enough.  You can use your student or postgraduate ID. <br><br>  <b>3. Package.</b> <br><br>  A package with a map, notebook and pen will be sent to you as soon as the results appear.  They reach Moscow faster than in Russia.  The courier will call you at the specified phone number and ask about the delivery time. <br><br>  If you specified the address, and then moved, the package will be delivered to the old address.  These are your problems as you get it.  Google will not make additional mailings. <br><br>  <b>4. Map.</b> <br><br>  The most mysterious part of the program is the map, since no one knows what to do with it. <br><br>  <b>How to withdraw money?</b> <br><br>  Only through an ATM.  If the thought of a bank transfer suddenly comes to your head - drive it with sticks to hell.  Reached the ATM, took the Bucks and rejoice.  Why so, now I will tell. <br><br>  Many people think that Citi Bank in Russia and Citi Bank in America are one bank.  Legally yes, (i.e. send, if anything, you will be at our bank), but technically not.  Banks that operate in Russia live according to the laws of Russia and drive payments through our Central Bank, and otherwise they do not know how and cannot.  So, when you come to a Russian bank with an American card, which seems to be like yours, but not framed here, they will send you to an ATM.  They cannot transfer money from it, because  there is no such account in their banking system - it is in America, and they have never seen such a card in their life. <br><br>  <b>How to see the balance?</b> <br><br>  Register <a href="https://www.na.citiprepaid.com/defaultlogin.do">online</a> <br>  You need to enter your login, password and, like, nothing more.  Below will be driven into the address of Google and other data - they do not change.  Even during registration, you will need a zip code - the sender's code on the envelope with the card, not your home. <br><br>  <b>How to activate the card?</b> <br><br>  To activate the card you need to call the bank.  Better on Skype.  The machine will respond, you will enter the card number and password (think for yourself) to the ATM.  And everyone can withdraw money. <br><br>  <b>Important!</b>  Write your login and password on the envelope of Google and put it together with the card.  Do not throw out the envelope before the last transaction. <br><br>  <b>Where and how to shoot?</b> <br><br>  In ATMs Citi.  Or in any other bank, the main thing is that the commission for issuing money from the card of another bank is not charged to you.  Citi Commission for international transfer $ 3.5. <br><br>  If you shoot in rubles, then you still pay for currency conversion.  How many - learn only from the bank.  I withdraw dollars and transfer to rubles in the bank where the rate is better.  You can also change dollars for rubles through an ATM, if you have a foreign currency account at this bank. <br><br>  In the bank insert, which comes with a card, the commission for the international transfer of 3% is indicated - another reason to reach the ATM.  Translation is more expensive.  There were also complaints from students in the mailing list for the loss of money during the transfer.  Do not do so - walk to the ATM. <br><br>  If you want to pay with your card in Russia in a store, please note that every time you will be charged 3% for a transfer.  But if you buy something in the American store, the commission will not be removed. <br><br>  If you withdraw money at an ATM not Citi, then give up the operation of issuing a check.  The cost of this paper may be $ 10, and maybe $ 100. <br><br>  Citi Bank has a transaction restriction.  Those.  You can withdraw no more than $ 400 in one day.  After withdrawing this amount within 24 hours you can not get your money.  Russian banks also have a cash limit.  Those.  ATM will not give you 1 time more than a certain amount, and each bank has its own amount.  Less stringent restrictions on withdrawing money from ATMs, which are located in the offices of the banks themselves.  Another ATM can have restrictions on the number of bills, i.e.  if you run out of $ 100, then at $ 50 he will not give you the full amount.  Look for ATMs with dollars that are regularly collected - better in the banks themselves, they are rarely empty. <br><br>  It may happen that the ATM will not have small bills, i.e.  less than 50. Then the balance will have to be removed in rubles.  If you take out rubles, be sure to find out the dollar rate in this bank, so as not to go into minus. <br><br>  Every ATM has restrictions on withdrawing dollars.  This is done to prevent money laundering.  You can‚Äôt even enter with Citi 500 and more, with UniCredit Bank 400 for customers of foreign cards.  In other banks you can withdraw from $ 300 to $ 500, but most often $ 400.  These restrictions may be imposed on the limits for withdrawing cash in rubles.  Those.  in dollars it can be possible, but in terms of rubles it is not. <br><br>  Also, Russian students were withdrawing money through the cashier of Citi Bank for one transaction through a transfer.  Let's count.  Here we are shooting $ 2000.  If through a bank cash desk, the commission is 3%, i.e.  $ 60.  If 4 times 500, then for each transaction we lose $ 3.5, which is only $ 14.  If we withdraw in another bank and commission $ 7.5 for each transaction, then we lose $ 30.  As you can see, it is profitable through an ATM, though on condition that the money is withdrawn in dollars, otherwise you will have to pay for the transfer into rubles. <br><br>  To immediately withdraw all the money, you need to call the bank and increase the withdrawal limit. <br><br>  <b>Minuses.</b> <br><br>  Be very careful with the score - you can go into the negative.  The commission is not immediately removed, but only after one or two days.  So, the fact that you should - do not know immediately.  So for example, I rent $ 400, and the commission is taken $ 4.  It should be like $ 3.5, but 50 cents, probably, went to the fund to help the starving bank.  It is still very difficult to calculate money when you are shooting in rubles - which rate you do not know exactly and how much the bank will charge for the conversion, too. <br><br>  If you are still included in the minus, then so easy to repay the debt you will not succeed.  You may have to write a letter to the bank, after which they will send you a bill to which you can transfer money.  How exactly does this procedure, I do not know. <br><br>  <b>Set the PIN code:</b> <br><br>  This instruction appears on the list every year.  Before you use it, all the same, read the Google insert, suddenly something has changed. <br><br>  1. Call USA phone via Skype 1-800-225-1115.  For students not USA number is another 001-610-941-4607.  Why everyone calls USA I don‚Äôt remember, probably because Skype is free. <br>  2. Next, enter the card number # 94043 (zip code) # PIN (you come up with it yourself) # PIN again to confirm. <br>  3. You must be told that your PIN is accepted. <br><br>  <b>Increase withdrawal limit:</b> <br><br>  Take the good old skype and call +18663268689 <br>  You will answer the machine, which will ask you: <br>  1. Language of communication.  There is no Russian, so choose English number 1 <br>  2. Card number <br>  3. Postcode - 94043 <br>  Then the machine will ask you what you want, and you want ‚Äúgeneral information‚Äù.  Those.  You answer the questions of the machine to access the operator.  The input should look like this (they can change something, so just listen to what they say to you): <br>  card number # 94043 ## 530 <br><br>  Next, we communicate with the operator.  In Russia, you will first be asked what you want, and there they will begin to communicate with the card number (call one digit), then your name, google address (there used to be a secret question, but now it is gone). <br>  Then you will be asked what you want.  Tell them "I would like to increase my transaction limit".  You will be asked how much.  If you have 2255 on the card, they will only be able to increase the limit to 3 thousand. If you ask for more, they will ask, why, you are poor and you have little money.  It is difficult to communicate with them - they speak quickly and there can be a very bad connection.  So all of their monologues can answer "I do not understand, but I want to withdraw all the money in one transaction." <br><br>  <b>5. ACM.</b> <br><br>  <a href="http://www.acm.org/">ACM</a> is another gift from Google.  Since students in GSoC often carry out research projects, Google decided to donate annual membership to all students.  After becoming a member of ACM, you can read the magazines of this association, download some Microsoft products for free and use the <a href="http://dl.acm.org/">ACM Digital Library</a> .  Actually, for the sake of the last you were hooked up.  Those.  almost all publications you can get for free.  Who is studying in the master or graduate school - this gift will appreciate.  The account remains with you regardless of whether you fly out at any stage or complete the program successfully (but you will receive a T-shirt if you complete the program). <br><br>  The association will create for you an email box, the letters from which will be sent to your gmail, will give you the number with which you will register, and will create a login from your first and last name. <br><br>  Now some features.  If you did not have an account in the association, then you simply register and use.  But if there was, there may be some interesting things.  There were students whose accounts were more ‚Äúexpensive‚Äù, i.e.  they had more reading rights than GSoC students.  What exactly does Google do in this situation, I don‚Äôt know, but there was a discussion thread with Carol. <br><br>  It is still not clear what is happening with the account of the student who extended it himself, and then re-entered the program.  In my last participation, the account looked as if it had just been brought in, only I did not register it anywhere.  I did not find any information about my payment.  But I was just approaching the expiration date of his action, but I don‚Äôt know how to be if payment was recently. <br><br>  If your account has ended and you want to extend it, then it will cost about $ 20, which is approximately 50% cheaper if you just bought it without GSoC.  If you yourself will pay for this account, then by mail from America you will receive a letter with thanks and lots of advertising. <br><br>  <b>6. Month May.</b> <br><br>  According to Google's schedule in May, you read the documentation, get acquainted with mentors and source codes.  For some reason, students think that ‚Äúread‚Äù should be understood as ‚Äúread‚Äù, and the writing of the ‚Äúhello world‚Äù code should be started during the period of the code.  In fact, you should start the first coding attempts in May.  All the difference between May and other months is that here you can blunt and ask stupid questions, and then not.  For some reason, the mentors think that from the beginning of June you will be dragging the real code and not asking: ‚Äúwhy did I do that, but it doesn‚Äôt work for me‚Äù.  I don‚Äôt know how to drag and combine the session, so it‚Äôs better to start moving in May during the May holidays. <br><br>  <b>7. The first deadline.</b> <br><br>  The most difficult thing is not to fail your first term of the report (do not confuse it with the midterm).  Maybe you think that the mentor will wait, but it is not.  He will look forward to your report, because  he is very worried.  While the project is just beginning, your mentor regularly checks mail and very often thinks about you.  So do what you want, but the first report should be by date. <br><br>  But if you suddenly realized that the complete garbage is written in your Timeline and you can‚Äôt provide the promised code to the first date, then it's time to revise it. <br><br>  <b>8. Mentor.</b> <br><br>  Your mentor is not a cute dude, with whom you will stir up the code in the summer, but your boss.  Of course, he is more friendly than the teachers at your university, but he is your boss.  Those.  he feels responsible for you and is afraid that you will fail and the whole community will receive less slots from Google next summer. <br><br>  Also, your mentor will be honest.  Though the money is not his, but he will dispose of them as his own.  Those.  if you fail somewhere, do not expect mercy.  An honest and decent person will sleep very badly at night, knowing that some student will undeservedly get a scholarship. <br><br>  Also do not expect warm communication at the initial stage of development.  You will be treated a little wary, and this caution will disappear only after the midterm.  But when you finish the project, you can already be friends and even attend a meeting of developers - you will be very happy. <br><br>  <b>9. First steps.</b> <br><br>  Once you understand the documents for Google, you need to do a few simple things. <br><br>  1. Unsubscribe from the newsletter that you are alive and happy to code all summer. <br>  2. Learn all the rules of behavior.  Those.  if you are asked to create a blog - create a blog, want to see you on IRC - sit there all the time, if you have not created your brunch yet - create, etc. <br>  3. Find out who your ‚Äúspare‚Äù mentor is.  Google recommends that you assign a spare mentor to any fireman, which means he should be.  If the community is small, then the ‚Äúspare‚Äù is all the other developers. <br>  4. Ask about the report form.  Those.  how and to whom you report.  Someone will ask you to write in detail everything in the blog, someone in the newsletter every week, someone just kommitit in the brunch. <br>  5. If there are no recommendations on style, ask if there are any at all and how to correspond to them. <br>  6. Ask about the documentation - if you need to keep records and if so, how. <br>  7. Find yourself a second computer - wherever you want, but to be.  Even if your iron friend never let you down, then this ‚Äúnever‚Äù according to the law of meanness can end right in summer.  A backup option should be. <br>  8. If you have not yet provided for your vacation in your Timeline, then it‚Äôs time to let the community know about it.  They need to know when and why you will be absent.  About the session is also worth writing. <br>  9. If you feel completely insecure, then find the organization's reports on last summer.  Usually through the mailing list you can find contacts of previous students.  You can write them a letter and ask them to give you a few tips on working in this organization.  I think they will be happy to share their experience with you. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/149793/">https://habr.com/ru/post/149793/</a></p>
