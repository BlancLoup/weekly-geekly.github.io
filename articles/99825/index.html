Intro</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  [Since this article was rapidly falling in the rating in the ‚ÄúIron‚Äù blog, threatening my presence at Habr√©, I republish it {already with a smaller picture in the top} on my personal blog, because I think that the intro is still needed] <br><br>  Hi Habr!  Today (as, however, and always) a great day to start our plans!  Anyone who has conceived something - start it and immediately!  You will start earlier - you will get a result and praise for not slowing down! <br><br>  So, I conceived this: to write a cycle of small articles about wireless equipment for our favorite computers and (laptop / no) beeches.  While not once again tell you about some kind of banal, Wi-Fi or Wi-Max, or a wonderful bluetooth mouse, no.  It will be a question of much more abrupt pieces, helping to drive out balls of electronic snakes from the house.

Each article will be devoted to a separate wireless topic or its subsection.  Thematic division plan something like this: <br><br>  - wireless video <br>  a) External video cards <br>  b) Built-in native video cards <br>  c) Video extenders or wire replacers <br>  d) Media Servers <br><br>  - wireless sound <br>  (sections are the same as in the video) <br><br>  - wireless electricity <br>  a) Transmission in contact <br>  b) Transmission at a distance <br>  c) Alternative sources <br><br>  - other wireless <br>  (WUSB, Wi-Gig, Wireless PCI-Express) <br><br>  All the devices that will be mentioned exist in real life and are already actively used in everyday life by Western IT geeks, but it‚Äôs our turn to bring comfort to our own homes and for us.  Real links to manufacturers and stores will be given after the description of each device. <br><br>  However, some existing wireless innovations have not yet entered the stage of mass production, so links to them, for the most part, will be limited to video from consumer electronics exhibitions. <br><br>  I also want to note that in runet information about a variety of wireless toys or very little and they are outdated, or, in some areas, they are simply missing as a fact.  So everything that will be covered in the cycle is carefully collected and structured information from Western forums and taken directly from manufacturers of wireless devices.  Some things in general can only be found at ebay or alibaba auctions: there is often no information about them on the websites of official representatives. <br><br>  <b>Wireless video</b> <br><br>  Transferring wireless video from a computer to a monitor / TV is perhaps one of the most popular functions on the market today.  There is even a number, in my opinion, of very poor devices, such as FM transmitters, only for video transmission: a computer or other other video signal is wrapped in a television broadcast signal and your TV just catches the channel created by you with a special receiver. The signal is limited to the specifications of today's TV standards, for example, for PAL, the maximum screen resolution will always be 720x576 pixels.  Similar to the compound tulips.  Their only advantage is that the devices are not afraid of any obstacles in the face of walls, furniture, ceilings;  have a good range of action - on several rooms / floors.  I will not honor these devices with a detailed review, however, for general development, I will give a couple of links to them: <br><br>  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Terk-Technologies-Leapfrog-LF-30S-Distribution/dp/B00009UHXR">www.amazon.com/Terk-Technologies-Leapfrog-LF-30S-Distribution/dp/B00009UHXR</a> <br><br>  <a href="http://www.rflinkusa.com/products_AVS5811.html">www.rflinkusa.com/products_AVS5811.html</a> <br><br>  Many of you, for sure, use some tricky devices, a la home (media) servers and technologies, such as DLNA, this type of wireless transmission of media content belongs to the section of media servers and will also be considered by us in subsequent articles. <br><br>  To avoid unnecessarily overloading the reader, I will end this introductory article and ask the distinguished public how to comment on the above with general and private wishes / corrections / additions, because the series of articles was conceived as an open dialogue between the author and Habravchana. <br><br>  So are you ready? <br><br>  To be continued‚Ä¶ <br><br></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/99825/">https://habr.com/ru/post/99825/</a></p>
