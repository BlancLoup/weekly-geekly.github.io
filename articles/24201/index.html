  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Valentin and K</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"> Pitertsev decided not to love Moscow.  It just happens on the machine, inoculated with mother's milk.  And they keep saying all the time to the place or not. Moscow is a big village.  But I fought off the pack and, contrary to the general tendency to go to work in Finland, France or, at worst, in Cherepovets, I decided to leave for this village. <br><a name="habracut"></a>  And I liked living in this big village, but all my friends kept saying: fu, you sold out to the Muscovites.  I argued my move by saying that the climate in Moscow is better.  Whether the situation around the village contributed, or something else, but everywhere I had good human relations, it was possible to agree and communicate with everyone.  And I got used to it and decided that this is a common thing.  He began to ride on a visit to St. Petersburg for the weekend.  And he stopped noticing that the climate is chillier and nastier in St. Petersburg.  It seems all the same. <br>  And so the stars went down, I quarreled with the girl, I had nowhere to live, my mother got sick, and decided to change the situation.  And I decided to return from the village to the cultural capital.  Found over the Internet a similar job as a boss <br>  N-th district in K ****** 15 minutes walk from the house.  The staff did not have a free Internet, so for future patriotic reasons, I still connected my St. Petersburg apartment to K ******.  I decided that I did not need to rent an apartment here, to spend money on the road, for train tickets and public transport too.  The salary, compared with Moscow, is less, it‚Äôs only 20,000 rubles to the head of the site, because taxes and deductions to insurance funds and medical services take a lot of money. <br><br>  Having distracted from the narration, it is worth noting that in order to prove that you are sick in St. Petersburg you need remarkable health, therefore only strong and healthy people can go to local clinics.  Because before you can take, you need to defend several huge queues and pass a bunch of preliminary tests.  And even if something hurts, it does not affect the general reception.  These are the rules.  By the way, Leningrad residents have one good trait from my point of view.  They do everything (or rather try to do it) according to the rules. <br><br>  26 ****** Friday <br>  So, I arrived at the station with a certain euphoria and immediately went in a jacket and tie to a new place of work in K ******.  I was hardly allowed in because I needed a pass, and without a pass I wasn‚Äôt allowed to enter, and the pass was made in the personnel department in 5 stops.  I was once registered, and I entered.  K ****** has a total of 20 thousand subscribers in the almost five millionth city of St. Petersburg. It‚Äôs smaller than the Moscow‚Äôs regional provider, although the whole city has been boiled down in optics and backup channels have been installed.  In general, the money vbuhano be healthy. <br>  I decided on the first and, as it turned out, the only test day of work to go with the master at my intended site, the N-th district.  They gave me the best master and we went.  There were about 400 applications and as there were not enough people, the masters were sent only on global issues. <br>  We went with the master through the N-th bridge to the area N. <br>  In St. Petersburg, all the attics and cellars wide open.  Anyone can enter, so getting to the equipment is very easy. <br>  1) 10: 00-11: 00 We got to the house, and almost all the equipment is in the basements, because underground optics is everywhere.  The basement, like most of the basements in St. Petersburg, turned out to be covered in shit and submerged.  There are so many mosquitoes that it seems to be eaten alive.  On the first node, it turned out that UPS was dead.  I connect the switch without Oops, and the node starts working, 6 houses are working from the node right away.  Well, I say, let's go, you need to leave a request, so that later they arrived and replaced the oops.  It is impossible, the master says, because if the clever man burns and he was not turned on via the OPS, then he and the site manager would be fired, so we cut all the clients back and move on.

      2) 11: 00-12: 00 In the second house, the power cord about 50 cm long was cut off. I say, let's restore it.  The master says, no, I don't have access to electricity.  I say that there are no problems, turn off the machine and connect the wire.  I was told that this is not according to the rules and he doesn‚Äôt have wires, and he doesn‚Äôt have the right to choke the wire in the box from the extension cable.  Fixed and went further. <br><br>  3) 1200-1300 The third house, it turned out, grew from the first, and therefore it was impossible to diagnose it, but I insisted on the decision to at least try to diagnose it.  We returned to the house with a dead Oops, temporarily turned it on, and then returned back and diagnosed the absence of the opto-linker.  This is in another department, with a sense of accomplishment said the master.  Naturally, he did not have any opto-watches.  In the meantime, it was lunch time, and we went to have dinner for an hour. (1300-1400) <br><br>  4) 1400-1500 We went only on global problems (canals), so when we came to the next house and it turned out that the switch was working, the master noted this in his order and decided to go further, but I did not give him.  I say, you see, not all links are burning, maybe a break is somewhere.  To which I was answered that this is a global problem and therefore there is no need to go to the apartments.  I said that if the problem was local, we would not have come here at all, and decided to follow where the wire goes.  We got to the apartment, where we found out that the wire was not really called.  The fact is that there are no twists and scotch tapes in K ****** (when I showed scotch locks in the office, everyone looked at it as a circus show) to each client there is a separate wire from the switch.  Therefore, when the wire is cut off in the middle, it is compressed and put a barrel (mother-mother) or a socket.  The wire was not cut, just was poorly compressed in the outlet in the weak point. <br>  It turned out that the master does not have jacks (RJ-45), because this month he has already spent his entire rate of Jacks.  And why didn‚Äôt I take it out of stock, I asked?  To which he replied that this month he was no longer supposed to have Jacks, that they were for the connection department, and he traded a couple of Jacks in this section for duct tape, and they also ended.  This is done so that there is a complete accounting of the consumables spent, and next month the site manager will order more Jacks, citing the lack of them this month, and just so no one can get anything.  Okay, I found Jack in my pocket, pressed out and the client earned.  Efficiency of work moved from scratch. <br><br>  5) 1500-1800 In the next house, a vithuha was cut out, and the switch was stolen.  It was diagnosed by a master a few days ago.  Our task was to see that nothing was fixed there, to call and wait for the arrival of the police.  Here, instead of abruptly repairing clients, they first call the police, then they draw up an act the next day, then, when the investigator examines the crime scene, they begin to repair it. <br>  In Moscow, they would just repair it right away, the policeman would be at the same time bringing the Internet for free, and there would not be any cuts, I said, to which you did not answer in Moscow, here everything is not done here according to the law, he said proudly and told about a dozen poor fellows who were put in prison for the cuts of wires at the entrances. (most likely they were all cops hung for solving crimes, otherwise the cuts would have been long gone) And we began to wait.  In the process of our waiting, it turned out that they fired my direct boss and his deputy.  Probably, the report was not written on time.  On the phone, I spoke with a different voice.  But the police did not have everything.  Finally, I saw a policeman passing by, and walked over to him.  It really turned out to be a district police officer, but no one called him up and he was not aware of us.  (probably, the time for calling the police coincided with the dismissal of the authorities and it was not up to us) He reluctantly followed us to the attic.  His whole appearance said that these Internet users pissed me off, he said - well, yes, well, they cut out, but I will not initiate cases, and so the carriage of statements from you, we didn‚Äôt understand the previous theft at the same place, will continue.  And he left.  It turned out that the very next day they put the box, they steal it, and to my question why not put the lock on the door, it's cheaper to unwelding wholesale, there was a reasonable answer, K ****** does not install locks, this is the housing department Moscow should not pay for it. <br>  This is the end of my working day, and I decided that I would stir up this anthill and get down to work after the weekend <br><br>  29 ****** Monday <br>  When I came to work, it turned out that the new chief did not have the right to take a person to the building and he told me to take urgent action. <br><br>  I must say that I was prepared for registration, - I took the TIN, the pension, the military officer, the statement with the head‚Äôs audit, the diploma, was photographed as it should, and when I came to the personnel department, it turned out that I hadn‚Äôt been given an appointment.  I phoned the head, he called the personnel department, they gave me a ‚Äúgrace‚Äù time for tomorrow morning. <br><br>  At the same time, to ****** the Internet in the apartment began to work poorly, but I decided that I would come to work there and fix everything. <br><br>  30 ****** Tuesday <br>  I came to the personnel department.  In the office were 3 girls who clearly had nothing to do, but they had a lot of paperwork.  They didn‚Äôt need my diploma of a programmer, because this is a secondary education, and a regional studies diploma came in handy (the first time in my life), because it is a higher education.  But they refused to start a new employment record, motivating it with the fact that I am going to the position of manager and there should be a record from the previous place of work, but I also need to take root in something, take a photo of the viscera (fluorography) and pass some kind of analysis.  From the last I somehow otmazalsya, saying that I will sit in the office, but with the labor it was necessary to decide and the copier of labor did not suit them.  And if the test, and we have the head of the department with a clean work record.  And no chocolates, compliments and eye structures on these accountants did not act.  Everything that works smoothly in any other city in Russia is powerless here.  It was read in their eyes, they got used to it in Moscow, that for money you can buy everything and hrenushki, - here is Petersburg.  And I immediately remembered all of my St. Petersburg ordeals with all sorts of certificates that I got sweat and blood, OVIR, INN, Pension, Sanepid stations, district administration, district police officers, STACS, etc., everything that I experienced, trying to work in St. Petersburg, doing your store.  But I decided that it was too early to give up.  I called Moscow and asked me to send me a work book and on the same day my friend sent me an urgent registered letter (2 days) to call on the main post office of St. Petersburg.  (for security, as the boxes in the porches open).  But not everything is so simple. <br><br>  The Internet at home began to work even worse, I called potential colleagues, to which I was told that they could not help, call the call center.  I must say that there is no call center telephone on any of the receipts that were left during the connection.  This alarmed me, but nothing, I was able to wait for the page to ****** on the Internet, recognized the phone and rang the bell.  K ****** single call center blondes in Moscow.  I was answered by a dear Moscow voice that does not understand anything blonde.  She told me nicely that work is underway and everything will be fine by 1 ******. <br><br>  31 ****** <br>  At the main post office, a strike began of drivers who said they did not have to unload the mail for the driver‚Äôs salary, and demanded a surcharge for shipping letters, and at the same time that someone had to clean the toilet, and a microwave to the office.  I realized that the workbook will be delayed. <br>  In the meantime, I ****** the Internet began to fail on the black.  The ports went flooding, which did not allow to work on the Internet at all.  The remote switch was overloaded every couple of minutes, ip telephony was almost not working.  I was told at the request to submit an application that work was underway, but potential colleagues did not know anything about these works and said that they never knew anything in Moscow, but they could not initiate an application. <br><br>  2 ****** <br>  Local radicals and communists joined the strikers. <br>  The rally in support of the strikers was dispersed by police, and several drivers were fired.  It would not be unknown where my work is, I would have demanded something with the strikers, but I was not up to the demands.  My friend was beaten at this meeting and taken to the police. <br><br>  Internet at home has stopped working altogether.  I submitted the application to the blonde, she said that they would be able to come 7 ****** from 10 to 15. <br><br>  From 3 to 6 ****** I went daily to the main post office in the city center.  (about an hour of driving there and an hour back) They do not give references on the phone (what if a secret letter). <br><br>  7 ****** <br>  In 1500, I called potential colleagues in K ******, they said that the application was killed because of many global problems, and they did not know that it was me.  They promised to come back later.  I was at home all day, the master never came.  I called again, they laughed and set for tomorrow.  At the post office labor was not there, they said that it was necessary to go with a receipt to where they were sent from and write a statement.  In my argument that the strike was here, I was told that these are the rules. <br>  The strikers at the post office joined the Ford plant, there they also demanded a salary increase.  I realized that as long as Saakashvili did not leave the presidency, I won‚Äôt see work.  (that is, never seen). <br>  The Internet has not appeared.  They dug up everything in front of the house, they wanted to be in time before the elections, and as always they did not.  They change the elevator for the third week, do not approach the garbage chute, so the St. Petersburg intelligentsia throws waste directly onto the stairs.  It smells like rats, drizzling rain.  I sit at home without work, without the Internet, depressed.  Classic.  Petersburg <br><br>  You know, it's great to love Peter from afar, as long as you don't live in it.  Now I understand that. <br><br>  I will endure the connection to the Internet via a modem, send this cry from the heart and go to the village. <br><br>  ps <br>  All the incidents did not happen to me, but could not restrain himself from publishing. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/24201/">https://habr.com/ru/post/24201/</a></p>
