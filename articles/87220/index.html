  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How I collected ru-domains from one registrar</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  UPD: <b>note</b> , the article describes the <b>outdated</b> successful domain transfer experience. <br><br>  Hello, Habrasoobschestvo and his dear readers! <br><br>  Once I found out that smart people have long been registering / extending domains in ru zone for 99 rubles from a REG.RU registrar partner - 2domains.ru.  I thought ‚Äúsome kind of cheating‚Äù.  But, the day came when I needed to register a domain, cheaper and faster.  ‚ÄúWhat the hell is not joking‚Äù, I thought and registered at 2domains.ru.  Listed from Webmoney 99 rubles, then filled out a simple questionnaire (the person to whom the domain is registered, the same information is displayed in whois).  Indicated the domain name and pressed the cherished button "register a domain"! <br><a name="habracut"></a>
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>
        <script>
          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      The most unexpected was the fact that the information in the whois-service was updated within 3 minutes.  Well, I think "they have their own whois for wiring."  And not here it was!  In any whois data about the newly registered domain was!  I set up the name-servers offered by the registrar and began to manage my DNS records from their panel.  Speaking of the panel, the control panel is very comfortable and fast-working for them (if someone is interested, you can see it yourself, again - ‚Äúfor taste and color‚Äù). <br><br>  Time passed relentlessly ... :) <br><br>  It was time to extend the domain - extended again without any problems, everything quickly, clearly.  For 99 rubles registered, for them and extended.  For the year, the use of any problems with the DNS was not.  I was also very pleased with the support service - quick, correct, polite.  And then I got the idea that you need to collect all your ru-shnye domains in one place, because  You don't want to pay at exorbitant prices (especially after feeling the registration / renewal for 99 rubles) + it is more convenient to manage from one panel and not from the three + at Reg.ru opened an office in St. Petersburg. <br><br>  I remembered where and what domains I have, it turned out: <br>  - Two in Garant-Park-Telecom - registration of 590 rubles, the extension of 415 rubles (r01.ru); <br>  - Two in Regtime - registration 390 rubles, the extension of 390 rubles (webnames.ru). <br><br>  Began to learn how to do it.  I read FAQs, asked for support for loyalty (where could it be without it). <br>  The transfer of domains from one registrar to another is simple - a letter with a statement to Regtime and to Garant-Perk-Telecom and they will give Reg.ru domains.  But everything was not so simple, everything turned out - it was necessary to write real letters (paper) and the statements should be notarized. <br><br>  I downloaded the application template (can be found on the sites of registrars).  Garant-Park-Telecom - Moscow (i.e. letters will be sent for at least 10 days), Regtime - Samara (even longer than to Moscow).  I am saddened of course, but the toad is stronger.  ‚ÄúRegister!  Extend it! ‚Äù:) I printed out the applications and went to the nearest notary.  The notary turned out to be a woman aged and looked at my statements ‚Äúabout some domains‚Äù with frankly big eyes, but she assured my signatures.  On the same day I rushed to the post.  Long thought how to send.  In the end, I decided to send a registered letter with a declared value (with an inventory of the contents). <br><br>  Prior to Garant-Park-Telecom letters went 14 days from the moment of sending.  On the day they received the letters, they notified me of this by e-mail.  I added the domains for transfer to the Reg.ru control panels and within an hour the previous registrar released them.  Half of the quest was completed :) <br><br>  Before Regtime, the news came in nine days, i.e.  letters went from St. Petersburg to Samara for 23 days. <br>  The letter stated that the domains will be transferred to Reg.ru if I send them a scanned copy of the passport.  Sent right away.  After a couple of hours the domains were transferred. <br><br>  It remained quite a bit - to transfer the domains directly inside Reg.ru, to their partner 2domains.ru. <br>  To do this, I downloaded the corresponding application from their website, printed it out, signed and sent a scan of the signed application + scan-kaopia of the passport to them by mail (with the request to transfer the domains to such and such partnership agreement).  The original letter and a copy of the passport must be taken / sent by mail to the Reg.ru office.  And since the office is now in my city - in the next couple of days I'll take it personally :) <br><br>  So, the money spent (transportation costs are not counted): <br>  - Two notarized signatures - 2x200 = 400 rubles; <br>  - Two envelopes - 2x4 = 8 rubles; <br>  - Two registered letters with a declared value - 2x105 = 210 rubles; <br>  - A photocopy of the passport at the Post of Russia = 14 rubles. <br><br>  Total: 632 rubles + 23 days of waiting and your domains in one place! <br><br>  Thanks for the karma - moved the topic from the blog in ‚ÄúAbout hosting and domains‚Äù!  :) <br><br>  PS: I don‚Äôt want to advertise anyone or anything, but all the names and organizations are real.  I hope my experience will be useful for the Habrasoobshchestvo and its respected readers! <br><br>  UPD: note, the article describes the outdated successful domain transfer experience. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/87220/">https://habr.com/ru/post/87220/</a></p>
