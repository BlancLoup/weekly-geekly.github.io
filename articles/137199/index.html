  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Atoms, neurons, internet and aliens</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><h4>  Elementary particles </h4><br>  Not long ago, a couple of hundred years ago, physicists discovered the atom and recognized it as indivisible.  Then other physicists divided it, once again divided it and are going to divide again.  And each time they diligently prove the elementary nature of the particles they discovered.  This leads me, a person far from physics, to the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe possibility of the infinite division of any physical element, of any matter.  And as a result - any particle of matter includes several similar particles of a lower level. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  Neural networks </h4><br>  We consist of matter and we are people.  But unlike silly matters, we can carry a thought.  Our thoughts live in our head, in the brain, the core of which is the neural network - it is she who creates and stores our thoughts.  Neurons are connected to each other by thousands of connections, but each of them has a main pathogen - a kind of sensor sticking in the body.  When something happens somewhere in our body, the sensors responsible for these parts of the body and these types of disturbances react to it and send signals to the neurons, which send them on to specific algorithms. <br><br><h4>  the Internet </h4><br>  There is a huge amount of information on the Internet, but in its essence it consists (very simply) of computers and communication channels.  All computers are connected directly or indirectly.  Some of them are associated with only one, some - with several at once.  All this is matter. <br><br>  The sensors on the "body" of the earth are we - the people.  It is we who send input disturbances in the form of our posts, photos, videos, etc. to the Internet.  Our brain works in part to ensure the holistic functioning of this gigantic mind.  Our web projects (social networks, blogs, communities, e-shops ...) are divisions of the global brain, where disturbances from people-sensors are collected, processed, transferred to other departments (search engines, bookmarks, aggregators ...).  All this is a thought.

      The more adequately for the sensors (users) the functions are implemented in the project and the more active these sensors are, the more interesting the project becomes for the Internet.  If the site is not used by anyone and no one does it, it dies.  Search engines forget about him, he disappears from the bookmarks.  Very similar to the development and death of unused neurons in our heads.  And the Internet itself is on the brain of the earth. <br><br>  In order for something to happen ‚Äúin real life‚Äù, now just the right perturbation of the correct sensor (or set of sensors) on the Internet is needed.  Our ‚Äúhands‚Äù are Internet feedback - we do what the customer asks us in a letter, go to a movie that recommends the ‚Äúright‚Äù community (Brain department), etc. <br><br>  It is enough these conjectures to present the Internet, as the big brain of a planet similar to ours. <br><br><h4>  Aliens </h4><br>  And now the main conclusion - if our brain ‚Äúbecame‚Äù a sensor for a more highly organized Brain, surely the Brain can become part of an even bigger Brain.  To do this, you need only two conditions: in the universe must be a planet-brains, organized no worse than ours, and we must make contact with them.  This is our main goal as a planet.  And we don‚Äôt even have to see the big-headed aliens - all we need to do is connect our Internet and them.  In this we are most hampered by the limitations of matter and space, but I am sure we will overcome them and will finally be able to communicate with aliens in ICQ </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/137199/">https://habr.com/ru/post/137199/</a></p>
