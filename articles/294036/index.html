Examining Widget Settings</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  For two months, <a href="http://cashmyvisit.com/%3Futm_source%3Dspark.ru%26utm_medium%3Darticle%26utm_campaign%3DCashMyVisit">we</a> conducted a study on the effect of various changes in the appearance of the widget on the conversion of calls from sites.  Read more about the result of the experiment in the article. <br><br>  In our opinion, marketing is certainly an important component of the business.  But even more important is broad analytics and system transparency.  This is the key to the development and effectiveness of the product and the company.  Therefore, we have conducted a new study and are ready to share the results! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/560/203/2e2/5602032e2a1b470083c5fbd3eecf03ea.jpg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Hearing the phrase: "Online feedback widgets give an increase in conversion of 100,500%!", You probably wondered how this happens?  In general, how realistic is it to increase conversion with this callback?

      <b>Experiment on living people</b> <br><br>  Analyzing the reaction of site visitors to certain settings of the widget was not so easy: there are a large number of external factors.  The purity of the experiment could have been affected, for example, by holding campaigns and changing advertising campaigns during data collection.  We tried to level this factor by the number of visitors and client sites participating in the research. <br><br>  Taking the base of 200 thousand visits, we began to collect indicators.  For the purity of the experiment were selected sites with different themes and appearance.  After clearing the base of the out-layers and selecting several hypotheses of interest, we began to measure behavioral responses to a particular change in the Cashmyvisit widget type and derived certain trends. <br>  This sacred knowledge can help you better understand the preferences of customers, and thus increase the conversion of your site.  Enjoy reading! <br><br>  1) <a href="http://cashmyvisit.com/%3Futm_source%3Dspark.ru%26utm_medium%3Darticle%26utm_campaign%3DCashMyVisit">Widget</a> color hypothesis: <br>  Clients of our service use a palette of 8 colors.  Highlighting the average conversion value, we realized that, for example, the yellow widget shows indicators higher by 28%.  While the black color brought the values ‚Äã‚Äãdown by 17%.  The red color did not cause any significant changes over the entire study. <br>  The graph shows that the color scheme definitely affects the clickability of the widget button. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/7cd/da0/209/7cdda0209e48475cb988894b1494b85f.jpg"><br>  When using purple, red and black colors, the percentage of visitors who left the site without making a call was high.  Yellow, orange, blue and green, on the contrary, had low indices, which meant they brought a greater percentage of successful connections after opening the widget window. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/870/176/c38/870176c38f644ccb98f7f094147fc385.jpg"><br><br>  2) The hypothesis about the effect of the logo: <br>  The presence of the logo in the widget window has a good effect on the recognition of the company, but the conversion rates for sites using this function and without it were not significantly different. <br>  Some enterprising companies use the image of an advertising banner with a promotion or bonus for site visitors, thereby increasing customer interest and conversion rates.  Therefore, we advise our customers to use this setting. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d74/4ec/040/d744ec040f824d249fd2844b94c41742.jpg"><br>  * Image taken from the official Skoda dealer site, Griffin-Auto. <br><br>  3) the hypothesis about the influence of the text in the <a href="http://cashmyvisit.com/%3Futm_source%3Dspark.ru%26utm_medium%3Darticle%26utm_campaign%3DCashMyVisit">widget</a> : <br>  We have broken existing types of text into 4 types: <br>  1) Standart is the text originally set by the system: ‚ÄúDid not find what you were looking for?  Any questions?  We will call you back in 27 seconds and help! ‚Äù. <br>  2) Sale - these are texts that include a variety of promotions and discounts.  For example, ‚ÄúInteresting offer with a profit of up to 38%?  Call now! ‚Äù,‚Äú A limited number of AVEO and CRUZE on the most favorable terms! ‚Äù. <br>  3) Subject - these are texts with an indication of specificity: "Let's talk about cars with mileage?", "Do you need help in choosing ventilation?". <br>  4) Other - this is any direct appeal to the site visitor.  For example, "Still thinking?", "Thank you, they will contact you soon." <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/683/bd1/006/683bd1006ce746db8843c035ab8af958.jpg"><br>  The hypothesis that marketing offers with various bonuses and discounts are the most effective was confirmed after a couple of weeks of research.  Regarding the average, that is, the conversion of sites with the text "Standart", the indicators of sites with a direct appeal to the client have a conversion of 20% higher.  And sites that use texts like ‚ÄúSale‚Äù, the conversion is 57% higher! <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/9cc/8c8/35a/9cc8c835ac9a4551ad557c403fc61fc4.jpg"><br>  We found that too few or a large number of words in the widget text adversely affect the conversion rates from sites.  The ideal length can be called 10-13 words in circulation.  Sites that use the optimal number of words in the text of the widget, have a conversion of 4% above the average. <br><br>  4) Hypothesis about the location of the button: <br>  We took 3 parameters as a basis: a button in the corner of the screen, a button on ¬æ of the screen (just above the middle), and a button on ¬Ω of the screen and above. <br>  The results showed that the button in the corner of the screen had the least impact on the conversion from sites, and the location of the button on the ¬Ω of the screen gave the conversion at 11% below the average.  The best result was shown by the button on the screen, the conversion from the sites was much higher, from 7% to 29%! <br><br>  5) Hypothesis about the form of a button: <br>  In our system there are two types of widget buttons: <br>  ‚Ä¢ Pulsating matte button with a picture of a handset, when pressed, the client will see the widget window. <br>  Visitors to the site can set the location of this button, while the next 7 days the system will show it in the selected space. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/343/2ae/3f1/3432ae3f11c84c3f9a52cf6dff287dfc.jpg"><br>  ‚Ä¢ Bright button, with a field for entering a phone number.  If necessary, visitors to the site can collapse the field that appears.  In this form, it is not possible to call the widget window by clicking on the button. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f41/153/8f9/f411538f905645e7b1e448855747738a.jpg"><br>  Sites that set the button with the exit field, had a conversion of 10% below average.  Preferred to install turned out to be a pulsing button, the conversion from sites was consistently high. <br><br>  <b>Promotional PS</b> <br>  It can be concluded about how important it is to interest the client with good marketing text, the location of the button, and even the color of the widget.  Using the feedback widget instead of a static image of the company number you will achieve great results! <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/3a8/fe6/1cc/3a8fe61cc0a24f68b19f1b3262582f8a.jpg"><br>  After registering, you can learn how different settings affect your performance.
