      This photo shows the height of the ceilings.  In the photo - bespereboyniki, more precisely, their power part.  Batteries are in another room.  Three white boxes in the middle - electrical switching nodes that allow you to decommission any of the power source (both inputs of the city electric network, ups, diesel engines) without stopping work.  I frankly swim in such electrical engineering, but during the prophylaxis, I looked at them (from afar) - inside the enormous thickness of the copper busbars - into my finger, thick, wide in the palm. <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a48/537/00b/a4853700b9c8593a27a36cd8d8de6ac8.jpg"></a> <br><br>  In the photo below you can see exactly how the cold corridor looks like - in a relatively close Technodom, it was not possible to see it in its entirety;  Each such "room" distributes cold air for two rows of racks for servers.  This photo was taken through the ‚Äúviewing window for clients‚Äù not during the main photo session, so the hall is in a completely unguarded form: half of the lighting is turned off (save, yep), you can see the trace of the daily wet cleaning. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/0d6/2a4/9ff/0d62a49ff3e1bb8231a20dddd2033e5d.jpg"></a> <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e3a/2a2/11b/e3a2a211ba63a13c3bb69373005ee25e.jpg"></a> <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/56a/c27/759/56ac2775963b6c016f13c222719d0d11.jpg"></a> <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/817/c14/63f/817c1463fb4668d340c3b4638a8d0f5b.jpg"></a> <br><br>  View in the cold corridor.  Pay attention to the ventilation, more precisely, to the perforated plates along the servers.  Through them enters the cold air.  The degree of perforation of these plates - 85% of the area. <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/047/91f/676/04791f67601acfffd97c4be824b4aa0f.jpg"></a> <br><br>  And here is a close-up plate from the vaults.  The whole raised floor is very interesting - it is a huge metal frame about half a meter high.  Plates of two types are put on it - solid (ordinary floor) and perforated.  Each such plate can withstand 500 kg, and it weighs about 5. It takes little effort to remove these plates from the floor, so vacuum plates are used to remove solid plates.  By the way, if it turns out that there is little active equipment in the cabinets, then the ventilation openings in front of it are closed so as not to waste the cold.  Flower Cold is not a deficiency, but it is valued because  This determines the cost of electricity for air conditioners. <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/3b7/239/b1b/3b7239b1b61097867cc6f16178859370.jpg"></a>  . <br><br>  It is uncomfortable to stand on such plates - the bottom is actually blowing 15-16 degrees, plus the noise is such that you have to shout. <br><br>  Outside is the ‚Äúhot corridor‚Äù space (this means that it‚Äôs not as cold as in the cold, although it‚Äôs still not very comfortable). <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/46d/f2b/adf/46df2badf964feccedd1af3371befa09.jpg"></a> <br><br>  All server wires (power and network) are connected from the side of the hot corridor.  On this side, the cabinets are closed (in the photo several locks were opened, in normal mode they are usually closed) <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/168/8f9/677/1688f96779c6cedf0e4ac32e05a9cb61.jpg"></a> <br><br><h1>  Purity </h1><br>  I think everyone knows what forms inside the computer under the table for a couple of years.  To prevent this from happening, we have: <br><ul><li>  Increased pressure in the server relative to atmospheric.  This does not mean that the door is difficult to close, but several dozen pascals completely determine the direction of air flow when the door is opened, and hence the direction of dust movement. </li><li>  Daily (this is not a joke) wet cleaning of the server room, several times a day the corridor is removed, along which the engineers pass from their premises to the server room </li><li>  Shoe covers at the entrance (about them below) </li><li>  Air conditioner air filters that are regularly cleaned and checked </li></ul><br>  Thanks to these measures, the servers remain clean.  I myself was very surprised when, during experiments with the equipment, I opened a server that worked in the server for at least a year, and all I saw was a barely noticeable layer, similar to what forms on a regular table in a day. <br><br>  A little about the boot covers.  At first we had ordinary boxes with shoe covers that had to be worn on our own.  All this was very much needed and a ‚Äúbachilator‚Äù was bought - a device for putting on shoe covers.  Unfortunately, normally he did not work and we again returned to manual dressing. <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/2b1/e48/a97/2b1e48a974e4a38e7ad4f68a07ffb235.jpg"></a> <br><br>  Then we bought a more cool model that works fine (it is she who is in the photo to the left of the box with shoe covers).  The principle of operation is simple - the foot is put on a thin sheet of plastic, they step on the swinging platform, the plastic is wrapped around the sole, heated by warm (hot? But it is not felt) air and hardens.  As soon as the foot is removed, the next sheet of plastic is blown out.  After the bahilier proved itself well, a second one was bought, for putting on both legs at the same time.  The only drawback of these boot covers is that they rustle very much when walking. <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/517/b7a/5fc/517b7a5fc1d2e42d9b2deb1524315d65.jpg"></a> <br><br><h1>  Security and video surveillance </h1><br>  Several security posts, an iron turntable in the entire wall, pass only through RFID tokens.  Access to the server is strictly limited, some of the staff (development department) can physically be in the server only with the maintainer (in fact, our programmers were there once, during the excursion after the end of the probation period). <br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/9f8/6b0/2b4/9f86b02b4c09fb944e3c56bedd51d229.jpg"></a> <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a3b/9b5/3cb/a3b9b53cbbf4fedf86748a07684c2ab4.jpg"></a> <br>  The server is literally studded with cameras from different angles.  The goal is to have full coverage, and not in the mode ‚Äúbut those 4 pixels in the corner - this is one of the cabinets‚Äù, but to be able to see clearly the entire image.  The cameras are not FullHD, only 720p, but they are color.  Of course, there are outdoor cameras.  Some cameras are not used for security, but for monitoring the operation of equipment, for example, there are cameras that ‚Äúlook‚Äù at external cooling units.  In addition to monitoring applications that tell what happened, if anything, the equipment is also visually observed.  For example, this camera looks not so much for the passage as for the bespereboynik.  (general plan - the first photo in the post). <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a42/ce4/5a7/a42ce45a79381bb1f917abed0dd12467.jpg"></a> <br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/41b/95e/08d/41b95e08dbb295200369f3a2976c6acf.jpg"></a> <br><h1>  Cooling </h1><br>  In the center of the room there are air conditioners.  They inject air under the raised floor, from where it passes through the ‚Äúholes in the floor‚Äù into the cold corridors.  As I noticed a man engaged in cooling systems: "pay attention to clean air filters." <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/9d2/7b2/e92/9d27b2e924bd914e44c742373585cff1.jpg"></a> <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/7d8/b21/41c/7d8b2141cdbde1b7f1cea6b76246b177.jpg"></a> <br><br>  Air conditioners have the N + 1 scheme, plus a decent supply (about 15 minutes) of cold air around (it is clear that no one is going to use it, but the reserve does not pull the pocket). <br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d0b/e92/897/d0be9289773736bfa5ccacca2e148fb7.jpg"></a> <br><br>  Since the server has high ceilings, on the second floor there are beautiful viewing windows for guests, from where you can watch life in the server.  This photo from the "far" end of the server, windows along the entire wall at the level of the second floor: <br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/7d4/b65/388/7d4b653882a63cd68994b60798f7c54c.jpg"></a> <br><br><h1>  Appearance </h1><br>  Here is our building and reception. <br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c1f/694/54f/c1f69454f13d66366df6248d1cb3c469.jpg"></a> <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ea3/e59/8af/ea3e598af931ed65a4bf52f0cd52f2a5.jpg"></a> <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/07c/ddc/ad8/07cddcad86ca58321d99c2daf65a5864.jpg"></a> <br><br>  And here clients can replace pieces of their collocation: <br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/465/184/0f8/4651840f8577d0e9253f989583cf07fc.jpg"></a> <br><br><h1>  Stupidity </h1><br>  The cult of penguin worship is very developed in Selectle.  In the presence of two totem - one glowing and plastic, the second plush. <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/fdc/353/81d/fdc35381d6b0eaac6f605adb6bd3b58d.jpg"></a> <br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/af8/cbc/560/af8cbc560a1db1bd09db1b4ae5daf145.jpg"></a> <br><br>  And the rest of the photos that liked the photographer.  I don‚Äôt know what to comment on in them, but they seem to be beautiful (although I would prefer to publish not a bundle of vulgar RJ45 categories 5E, but a similar bundle of 10G optics).  But, the photographer has already run away, but the photos remain. <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/6f0/958/255/6f0958255725af4879d1a021bbf8480b.jpg"></a> <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/3c9/599/68f/3c959968f2936c8e19c031853cd3bcec.jpg"></a> <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/1f2/3ea/882/1f23ea882a7dbf65cb76858ec7f53f99.jpg"></a> <br><br>  Unfortunately, we were not given a chance to properly capture diesel engines, underground storage of diesel fuel, and, most importantly, we were not allowed into the switchboard.  6 kilovolts, however. <br><br>  For those who suffered from the communication center in Tekhnodom - there are no operators on Flower Discrimination, their racks are placed in the common room. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/136559/">https://habr.com/ru/post/136559/</a></p>
