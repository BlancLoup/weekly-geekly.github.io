They started a startup and asked for help.  So I took up Ruby.  In general, searching through friends is a very good approach.  Our whole company is built on this and everyone is happy.  Take note of this. <br><br>  <b>Where are you looking for work?</b>  <b>Can you give me some advice on where to look for Ruby orders?</b> <br>  In general, I was lucky, I never looked for work, she found me herself. <br>  When I studied at the university I was engaged in freelancing, and then I was invited by one of the companies for which I was already working to participate in one project.

      <b>What advice would you give to a beginner without completed projects?</b> <br>  Be noticeable.  Nowadays it is not difficult, to show yourself in public, personally I think it is even more important than a resume. <br>  And then a lot of people from the community will know - you are the one who can help them. <br><br>  <b>What did you do at the very beginning to learn Ruby, find customers, etc.?</b>  <b>Many people dream of changing the past.</b>  <b>What can you advise?</b> <br>  I don‚Äôt know what to say about the past ... My biggest problem was the broadest interests.  If I decided to do something else - then I would decide again to do something else.  What I know for sure - the place where you decided to stop is not the place where you actually stay. <br>  My current job is not related to my education.  But I would not refuse it anyway.  I like the fact that I do a lot of different things, and I don‚Äôt do programming alone. <br><br>  <b>What books, recipes, tips can you give me to make me better as a programmer?</b> <br>  Read non-programming items.  Find out what drives people, how they think.  I think it is very useful to know, for example, what controls the client.  This will make products even better.  I often watch inspirational TED videos or read blogs like Freakonomics. <br>  Of course, I read a bunch of Ruby blogs.  But do not limit your views to programming, let alone Ruby. <br><br>  <b>How much do you work per week?</b>  <b>How do you fuel your interest in work?</b> <br>  Somewhere 39 hours a week, although our company works according to the results, and not the time spent (Approx. Lane ROWE). <br>  <a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/dan_pink_on_motivation.html">My opinion on TED</a> . <br>  Therefore, the clock means nothing to me.  All for the sake of the result.  Sometimes I work very much, sometimes I meet with clients and discuss. <br>  If I want to take time off, I take it, because listening to myself and my body is an important thing if you do not want to burn out quickly at work.  Work at night - at a loss, the quality is only worse. <br><br>  <b>How do you organize your workplace and what tools do you use?</b> <br>  Mac, Textmate, Git.  My workplace looks crazy.  Although the mess does not bother me - I understand my system blindfolded. <br><br>  <b>What do you recommend to become a successful and secure programmer?</b> <br>  Only one thing - love what you do.  Therefore, no matter how much I pay, the main thing - the pleasure of work.  Although, without a decent payment is also bad.  Therefore, you should always look for a suitable place.  When you go to the interview, understand, it is not only to understand whether you are suitable for them, but also if they are suitable for you. <br>  As I said, light up is also very important.  Participate in open source projects, although it is difficult.  It will also greatly increase your value and success among other people. <br><br>  <b>What should every programmer know?</b> <br>  All your code is shit, so always try to improve.  Always learn new, play with it.  Do not lose interest in the work, believe in your product. <br><br>  What is it like to be a person like you? <br>  Working from 9 to 5 is not what will make me happy.  Work should be enjoyable and there should always be a place for fun. <br>  Hope this helped. <br><br>  <b>Thanks for the interview.</b> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/95225/">https://habr.com/ru/post/95225/</a></p>
