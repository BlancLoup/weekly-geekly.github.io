  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Small spool and expensive: in-ear headphones from Fostex</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Hi, Giktayms!  For many audiophiles of the world, the name Fostex has almost become a household name - so fans of the brand even appreciate headphones from other manufacturers: you can often hear phrases like ‚Äúthey sound like <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/hfhe/blog/281076/">TH-610</a> or TH-900‚Äù.  It is not surprising, since this company has been on the sound market for more than 40 years, and during this time has managed to conquer millions of ears, including well-known ones, such as Michael Jackson, for whom the Fostex T20 turned out to be the only headphones that came to the performer at the maximum volume level. <br><br> <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/hfhe/blog/289301/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/d9d/38a/e80/d9d38ae809e4488c9a0040e0bcb130b3.jpg"></a> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Fostex itself began as early as 1973, moreover as a subsidiary of the Japanese Foster Electric Company.  Accordingly, the company was focused primarily on the Land of the Rising Sun - there, by the way, the concentration of audiophiles per square kilometer is still much higher than in many European countries, so they know a lot about good sound in Japan.  Already a couple of years after its founding, Fostex patents the emission of sound waves without changing the phase with the help of a new diaphragm production technology, which is called the Regular Phase.  It can be said that it was precisely this step that, for the first time, allowed the manufacturer to gain worldwide fame and penetrate other markets than Japanese.  And quite successfully. <br><br>  Many people are mistaken that Fostex has succeeded only in full-size headphones.  Of course, the TR line became significant for the manufacturer (by the way, we got acquainted with its representatives), but the company also managed to establish itself on the intra-channel front.  And today, as promised in the <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/hfhe/blog/289257/">review of HiFiMan MegaMini</a> , we will get acquainted with two Fostex plug-in headphones - TE-05 BK and TE-04 BL.

      <br>
      And let's begin, perhaps, with the older model - <a href="http://fostexsound.ru/products/inear/te-05-bk-bz/">TE-05 BK</a> .  The last two letters in this case indicate the color of the headphones (Black - black), there is also a model in bronze version (BZ).  Fostex began selling new products at the end of this winter - the headphones became an updated version of the TE-05 and received several important improvements.  What I want to note first of all is the aluminum case and the new cable, made of high-quality oxygen-free copper, which is itself ‚Äúequipped‚Äù with a built-in microphone and a control panel: that is, headphones with the function of a headset.  From the remote you can control incoming calls and music playback.  The cable is still removable. <br><br>  And, of course, the performance of new products at a height - it is provided by 8-millimeter drivers.  Special attention in TE-05 BK Fostex was given to bass, which we will try to make sure at the listening stage. <br><br><h2>  TE05BK grade </h2><br>  By tradition, Fostex responsibly approached the box - a stylish black and gold case with the inscription ‚ÄúHi-Res Audio‚Äù (where without it) in the small window hides the headphones themselves with the company logo. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/eb2/b99/10f/eb2b9910f7845f6845be44330d08d425.jpg"><br><br>  Headphones are equipped with a removable cable with a microphone and a remote control, ear cushions of four sizes (XS, S, M and L), as well as a very high quality made of genuine leather.  Everything you need is included: a leather case makes it easy to transport the headphones without damage, and with interchangeable ear cushions, everyone can choose a comfortable fit for themselves. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/e08/338/be5/e08338be5eac8bdf1a9dccc7ea830359.jpg"><br><br>  Removable cable - the solution is correct, because if you want, you can replace it (for example, if you wanted to upgrade, or if the cable itself became unusable, which is unlikely). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/063/23f/aa1/06323faa1ef334622f865d6b709a83c8.jpg"><br><br><h2>  Appearance </h2><br>  With the design of this manufacturer has never had any problems.  Here we are also greeted by an aluminum case, which not only makes the appearance of the headphones premium, but also to a certain extent improves the acoustic properties of the TE-05 BK.  Oxygen-free copper cable looks no less impressive. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/704/9fb/611/7049fb611e9d3f21b7a7242fc073848b.jpg"><br><br>  By itself, a removable cable will not fly out - it is securely fastened.  The latter, by the way, has a length of 1.2 meters - it is enough not only to use headphones when playing sports, but simply for warm gatherings with your favorite player by the fireplace. <br><br>  The design of Fostex is envied by many manufacturers of acoustic equipment, and the updated TE-05 are no exception. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/901/298/e3a/901298e3a6414ea7a2b1b76227dca6d0.jpg"><br><br>  Since it is not customary to talk a lot about the appearance of in-ear headphones (they are either stylish and cool, or cheap and ugly), let's move on to the more interesting part - technical characteristics.  And consider immediately two models of plug-in headphones from Fostex, at the same time to compare them. <br><br>  Characteristics of TE-05 BK and TE-04 BL <br><table><tbody><tr><td>  <b>Characteristic</b> <br></td><td width="250">  <b><a href="http://fostexsound.ru/products/inear/te-05-bk-bz/">Fostex TE-05 BK</a></b> <br></td><td width="250">  <b><a href="http://fostexsound.ru/products/inear/te04/">Fostex TE-04 BL</a></b> <br></td></tr><tr><td>  Sound Emitter Type <br></td><td>  Dynamic <br></td><td>  Dynamic <br></td></tr><tr><td>  Landing in the ears <br></td><td>  Plugin <br></td><td>  Plugin <br></td></tr><tr><td>  Headphone Type <br></td><td>  Closed <br></td><td>  Closed <br></td></tr><tr><td>  Resistance <br></td><td>  16 ohm <br></td><td>  16 ohm <br></td></tr><tr><td>  Sensitivity <br></td><td>  93 dB <br></td><td>  94 dB <br></td></tr><tr><td>  Maximum input power <br></td><td>  5 mW <br></td><td>  5 mW <br></td></tr><tr><td>  Frequency range <br></td><td>  10 - 20 000 Hz <br></td><td>  10 - 25 000 Hz <br></td></tr><tr><td>  Plug <br></td><td>  3.5 mm <br></td><td>  3.5 mm <br></td></tr><tr><td>  Headset function <br></td><td>  Yes <br></td><td>  Yes <br></td></tr><tr><td>  Remote Control <br></td><td>  Yes <br></td><td>  Yes <br></td></tr><tr><td>  Weight <br></td><td>  10 g <br></td><td>  16 g <br></td></tr></tbody></table><br>  It can be seen that the range of reproduced frequencies in TE-05 BK is slightly less than that of TE-04.  Both models are equipped with a remote control playback on the cable, and the younger one in the kit put two at once (more on that later).  The sound characteristics of the model are very similar: the same powerful dynamic emitter (8 mm drivers), on guard of sound in TE-04 are neodymium magnets and CCAW winding of coils that uses copper-coated aluminum wire.  TE-05 BK is slightly less sensitive, but weight is 10 grams versus 16 grams. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/335/8ba/758/3358ba75800362f53ea5a9fb98243ce8.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/4a0/8fa/397/4a08fa397da37ff0fe6637eb1225ccf9.jpg"><br><br>  Since we started talking about the TE-04 model, let's get acquainted with it a little (especially since we opened the box a long time ago), and then we will evaluate the sound characteristics of this couple, in which one interesting player will help us. <br><br><h2>  <a href="http://fostexsound.ru/products/inear/te04/">TE-04 BL</a> Package </h2><br>  In appearance, the box of these headphones is no less interesting than that of the TE-05 BK, however, as well as the package bundle.  In addition to the headphones themselves, two cables were put in the box: one is normal with a 3.5 mm plug and the other with a microphone and a control panel so that the headphones can be used with a smartphone as a headset.  The kit also silicone ear cushions in four sizes (XS, S, M, L), documentation and a case that smells good with new leather shoes. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/0b4/6f6/33e/0b46f633e906bd9943486cf1f55a173c.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/035/148/801/035148801951091a930f996122d541b7.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/7c9/6e5/3ef/7c96e53ef6bb8b0a7c226f7f92a94cfa.jpg"><br><br><h2>  Appearance </h2><br>  But the design of TE-04 BL is different.  Firstly, the headphones themselves are not made of aluminum, like TE-05 BK, but of plastic, which, although durable and lightweight, is plastic.  However, the use of this material allowed Fostex to expand the color range of these headphones - they are presented in four colors: matte black (BK), bright turquoise (BL), carmine red (RD) and pure white (WH). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/83a/1d1/148/83a1d1148a13001a2325e8aaa569de6b.jpg"><br><br>  Externally, the headphones look more modern, the original bright body and asks for a jog or dynamic walk somewhere in the city center.  The cable here is the same as in TE-05, the removable mechanism is implemented very conveniently. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/4d3/047/d92/4d3047d9230c87b02a0bb51552605350.jpg"><br><br><h2>  Sonic Battle </h2><br>  To test the sound capabilities of our couple, we used HiFiMan MegaMini, iPhone 7 and MacBook Pro 2016 audio players. TE-04 BL and TE-05 BK showed their potential especially with the player, which is designed approximately for headphones of this price segment.  The symbiosis of MegaMini and Fostex headphones to some extent is even striking: in all cases, the medium and high frequencies work well. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/e93/ad1/a81/e93ad1a81af2a6bc549b595fb6b5d9ba.jpg"><br><br>  As for genres, there is a slight distinction.  In the TE-05 BK, there is a clear emphasis on bass, so in these headphones it is very cool to listen to hip-hop, R &amp; B and other similar genres.  But TE-04 BL is perhaps better revealed with electronic music, rock and ... classics.  Yes, according to a subjective assessment, the last genre works best in TE-04. <br><br>  Separately, I would like to note the excellent sound insulation of the headphones (for TE-05 BK, it is still slightly better) - they withstood the ‚Äúpunch test‚Äù of the new building adequately, which helped to get rid of annoying distracting noises, focus and finish this review. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/d45/f57/629/d45f576296e96de29c31a14abb4e5f25.jpg"><br><br>  And, of course, the frequency response - for those who hear not only with their ears. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/bc8/c95/abd/bc8c95abd2a491bb94f3a0487d42793c.jpg"><br>  <i>Fostex TE-05 BK</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/bc2/6ce/482/bc26ce4824ae1bd1e9ced758ba1bd94b.jpg"><br>  <i>Fostex TE-05 BK</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/bdf/412/6ce/bdf4126ce117936c584225db6069fdc7.jpg"><br>  <i>Fostex TE-05 BK</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/c11/0f0/025/c110f002560a562fe3eb63ad26a1e040.jpg"><br>  <i>Fostex TE-04 BL</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/ee0/c76/7aa/ee0c767aa0bdedf78d01bb3801d7fee8.jpg"><br>  <i>Fostex TE-04 BL</i> <br><br><h2>  What to choose? </h2><br>  This is not an entirely correct question.  After all, the ‚Äúchoice‚Äù between these headphones depends entirely on the purpose for which you need them, and which musical genres you prefer.  <a href="http://fostexsound.ru/products/inear/te-05-bk-bz/">TE-05 BK</a> - strict, with an emphasis on bass, aluminum, well, a little more expensive.  <a href="http://fostexsound.ru/products/inear/te04/">TE-04 BL</a> - bright, sports - in general, for those who do not stand still, likes to hang out and listen to electronic music.  In general, they would advise to listen to both models before buying, yet everyone‚Äôs hearing is different.  But one thing is guaranteed for sure - none of the models will disappoint. <br><br>  A couple more reviews on brand products: <br><br>  - <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/hfhe/blog/281076/">Wooden Fostex TH-610</a> <br>  - <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/hfhe/blog/284156/">Fostex TR range overview</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/404005/">https://habr.com/ru/post/404005/</a></p>
