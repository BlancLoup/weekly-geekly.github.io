      If you have not read the first article, I recommend that you first read <a href="https://geektimes.ru/post/287924/">it</a> .  Saturday April 15th was magical for me.  It was on this day that I noticed a working terminal on bus number 67.  It made me happy.  Perhaps, of course, payment was launched before, because the last time I traveled on an ‚Äúadvanced‚Äù transport on Wednesday. <br><br>  And then came the moment of truth.  I take out my contactless bank card, walk to the front door and ask the driver: ‚ÄúCan I pay with a card?‚Äù.  To which I get the answer: ‚ÄúYes.  Do you have a card with WI-FI? ".  A little unexpected.  As I said in the previous article, for many people the contactless payment icon is associated with WI-FI.  You could certainly say: ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt have a WI-FI card, but there is a contactless one.‚Äù  But I, without becoming a driver in technical details, tritely answered: "Yes." <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Terminal</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/65c/5f7/016/65c5f7016c294504be9b80a9f0421b95.JPG"><br></div></div><br>  The driver turned the terminal to me, pressed the green button, I attached a map.  Not a second passed, as the check got.  I tried to take the check.  But the device did not cut it.  Therefore, a lot of paper was squandered, to which I received a portion of mats from the driver and he tore off the check. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Check</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/9cd/f15/72a/9cdf1572ad914e5c9c7a50857700079c.JPG"><br></div></div><br>  The difference in the time of arrival of E-Mail and the time of printing a check was a minute.  I thought that most likely the mail server was just late, and the operations go online.  But let's not rush to conclusions. <br><br>  In the evening, I came across the coveted second tram, on the doors of which there were all stickers known to us.  The interesting thing is that there are other posters on the Trams and Trolleybuses than on the buses.  The price is also indicated when paying by card, which is no different from paying in cash. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Tram clearance</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/667/d63/54f/667d6354f4d04c8b872b5755db8efab4.JPG"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ae0/230/65e/ae023065e2074a54bdd8581d40a989b8.JPG"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c1f/7f5/2c1/c1f7f52c1c3945f592985f8b78f34c8a.JPG"><br></div></div><br>  The conductor in the tram goes with two devices: with the terminal and with the device, for printing ordinary tickets.  Showing the card to the conductor, she was overjoyed to press the green button, and I attached the card.  Everything went just as quickly.  This time the check was torn off by the conductor, but the mark of the terminal was the same, and most likely, it also does not cut the paper.  I received my ticket with the phrase "Here, see how fast."  Smiled.  Indeed, to pay with a card is much faster than to suffer with a trifle. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Checks</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/295/c73/1e6/295c731e67464e5ba4bcfd21b3be1eb2.JPG"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/58d/04f/c5c/58d04fc5cd1f4f4d8d5377da42b256dd.JPG"><br></div></div><br>  You can also notice that checks are different from the "shop".  These checks indicate the type of transport and its route.  But instead of the Sberbank logo, here is the inscription "Ticket". <br><br>  Checking the E-Mail, I noticed that the letter had already arrived 4 minutes later.  This is not a delay.  This really confirms that the operations take place in offline.  Also, if you enter your personal account on the Sberbank website, you can see that it is not the time of payment recorded there, but the time when it arrived at the bank. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/101/655/ca0/101655ca0abe431ba116937a1c68815c.PNG"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/1fa/596/480/1fa596480b1044a483e3fa700d4ee85b.PNG"><br><br>  Unfortunately, Sberbank does not write in the personal account mode of transport.  But it is displayed in Yandex.Money.  In this case, the tram and bus different MCC.  At the tram: 4111 Commuter Transport, Ferries [Transportation - commuter and local seasonal vehicles, including electric trains].  And the bus already has this: 4131 Bus Lines [Bus lines].  Well, of course, the tram is more like an electric train.  Although most likely the terminals simply set up various organizations responsible for electrical and motor transport in Irkutsk. <br><br>  Of course there are things that it is desirable to fix: <br><br><ul><li>  Make it so that the bus terminals hang closer to the passenger, and not in the driver‚Äôs cabin. </li><li>  It is desirable, of course, that the terminal be turned all the time by the screen to the passenger, and not to the driver.  Unscrewed terminal is associated with the fact that it does not work. </li><li>  It is not very convenient to make an automatic cutting of a check; it is not very convenient to tear off a check for each passenger. </li><li>  For vehicles with conductors, it is desirable to reduce the thickness of the terminal (there are mobile versions and thinner).  It is also desirable to combine in one device the terminal and the device for printing ordinary tickets. </li><li>  Make a green digging more, and not to hammer it in the corner under the cover.  Otherwise, you can miss, and bring down the settings in the terminal. </li></ul><br><br>  In principle, this is all.  It remains only to wait for the massive launch of this project. <br><br>  <b>UPD:</b> <a href="https://geektimes.ru/post/288286/">answers</a> to some questions. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/403333/">https://habr.com/ru/post/403333/</a></p>
