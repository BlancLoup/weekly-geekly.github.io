  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Education for all?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Greetings to you, oh everyone who comes in here. <br><br>  I will do without preludes and go straight to the point. <br><blockquote>  According to my observations, about 80% of students in vain study at universities - they went there either to cut themselves off from the army (concerns young men), or because they just need to, or because everyone goes, or because their parents sent, and in fact they studied on the drum so why are they studying?  I received answers to this question very different, but none of these people said that he wanted to master the specialty or somehow advance the science that he was studying or something else worthy - half just do not know, and half find any reasons not related to study  Is there a way out of this situation? </blockquote><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  In general, there is always a way out!  Well, here I thought, why not limit admission to universities, do for example so that schoolchildren first go and get a secondary vocational education, then get work experience for at least a year and only then have the right to enroll in a university.  Then the number of people in universities will be less and the contingent there will be better (in the sense of those who really want to learn and who need it).  One of the reasons why universities are flooded is also being drafted into the army, tell me why the army needs people who just disgust it, who in every way wants to dodge and who is simply not ready for the army - why do we need such soldiers?  It may be better to increase the number of cadet corps and military schools and form an army of people who graduated from such institutions - only then can we talk about a professional army.  After all, even to be a soldier must learn. <br>  Another point concerning the quality of our education: they teach badly in universities, the ancient and already enrolled students have handed over the bases of tasks (often for money) and the students pass them (most of the teachers consider these students exemplary and exemplary: ) unlike those who do something themselves (not about all)).  Yes, and business would pay attention to training for themselves, to allocate money, to help in the formation of a new database of tasks and much more can be done.  But one can talk about all this endlessly, I am not the first and not the last, the question is whether they hear at least something above ... <br><br>  Now, I wonder if many people will agree with me in my judgments, or will they accuse me of depriving them of their freedoms and the right to education?  So the question is - is it necessary for ALL education?  Is it necessary for the state to train 1000 people who do not want to study and still do not understand anything and most likely will not work in their specialty?  Or it is better to train 10 people, but those to whom education will be useful and who will be able to benefit the state and no matter how loud it is said - to humanity! <br>  The benefit is obvious to everyone, but why nobody sees it.  Maybe our country does not need educated people?  As Master Yoda said in Star Wars: "... on the dark side of thought, such thoughts will lead you ..", so let‚Äôs skip this thought and believe in our state. <br>  Communicating with many entrepreneurs, managers in various companies and other people, I often had to hear complaints about university graduates, something like: ‚ÄúWell done came - knows nothing, but wants a big salary!  After all, he did not get the Higher Education. ‚Äù  And here is an example - recently at one conference devoted to innovations in education (or something like, I apologize for not remembering for sure - I was so busy debating with the participants that even the name of the conference flew out of my head) I had the pleasure to communicate with a graduate *** *** who, as he claimed, is trained in the specialty of a top manager - to be honest, this is both funny and sad.  Well, this young man complained that graduates are not allowed to occupy positions corresponding to their specialties, but they are placed in lower positions - well, in short.  Well, let us imagine a student who has just graduated as a top manager at some company ... well, everyone imagined, okay, even if he really doesn‚Äôt have talent, well, if not, and if he has not mastered the university course, what will he do then? ?  For comparison, let us imagine a graduate surgeon who, when he comes to the hospital, requires a scalpel in order to start ‚Äúcutting‚Äù - and after all he will cut, that is what he will cut, he will not rust.  Also, in managerial positions, people should come with experience.

      Well, on this topic, I can argue for a very long time, what they say is sore.
