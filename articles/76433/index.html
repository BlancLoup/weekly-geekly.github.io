  <section class="page js-page"><h1>7 tricks for your company's twitter</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img align="right" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/668/0f8/72e/6680f872eb1aa9639e61ff2be06d7951.png">  Twitter @ <a rel="external" href="http://twitter.com/turbomilk">turbomilk is</a> one of the most popular corporate twitter of Russia (almost one and a half thousand followers).  Every employee has passwords from our twitter.  True, only a few people write, but it turned out that I‚Äôm writing most of it.  In more than a year of observations and experiments in public, I had gained a number of unintelligible tricks on how to make twitter more interesting and popular. <br><br>  At first, our corporate twitter was an experiment.  We wrote there anything.  For some, he even became a substitute for personal twitter.  Once I happened to take a look at our tweets from the side in a small unfamiliar company - the room was filled with stifled giggles ... So we realized that we should continue in the same spirit.  So, what should you do on corporate twitter? <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  1. Follow, but not everyone </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/58d/aa1/b51/58daa1b51a3c931383961dfb9fff17a9.png"><br><br>  If your company does not have a twitter yet, start it and start with a simple one: follow your friends and a few corporate tweets of similar subjects.  Some of them will probably be curious about what you are going to write there.  So you get the first followers, that is, readers.  I do not advise you to follow everyone - it's just a bad form, akin to spam.

    <h4>  2. Simplicity is better than theft </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/d8a/30e/4a8/d8a30e4a8f456ab264bc891225030d59.png"><br>  One hundred and forty characters are very few if you write in an official dry language with complex turns.  Keep it simple and understand that even in such a short message you can fit a bunch of useful and most importantly understandable information.  Being simple, clear and concise is generally very useful and can help you sharpen it. <br><br><h4>  3. Everyone has news </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/18b/f79/b8d/18bf79b8dd5be4e0603861f0b4286101.png"><br>  Start with the news of your company: new arrivals of goods or the emergence of new services, the opening of new offices / shops, promotions and discounts, working hours on weekends and holidays.  In time, you yourself will understand what your followers are interested in. <br><br><h4>  4. Be bolder - experiment </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/c32/113/118/c321131180eea4250fc0af2c4b1fc858.png"><br>  Most users use Twitter to tell what they are doing or, for example, what they have just eaten.  Your company can do that too.  Tell us about the project involved in the company, who and where is going on vacation or where most workers go to lunch.  Surely there will be someone who will find a review, perhaps someone is doing a similar project, going there or having lunch at the next table.  Start writing at least something - experiment.  Life itself will lead you on the right path and, believe me, there will always be those to whom you are interested. <br><br><h4>  5. Communicate with users </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/549/d82/3c8/549d823c89a1eeee8f475e34aa56c3db.png"><br>  Show everyone that you not only write, but also read, and, most importantly, that you care.  Make public replays on the most key questions of your readers, but don‚Äôt get carried away: the tape from some replays looks dull.  Direct messadzhi - salvation in particularly sensitive situations.  The main thing, do not forget to write down your respondent, otherwise he will not be able to answer you. <br><br>  Finally, two bonuses that helped us make our twitter more popular. <br><br><h4>  6. kidding </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/41c/cc7/6a4/41ccc76a406a09b00bc44872bef4dfc9.png"><br>  Stupid uncomplicated self-jokes are the golden horse of turbomilkovsky twitter.  Humor, along with cruelty and sex, is quite a popular thing.  Sex and cruelty in our work is still not enough, but the jokes in the process of internal corporate communication are born countless.  Only the highest quality, moderately vulgar jokes are aired on our twitter.  Many of them have been subjected to countless retweets, and this is known to be the best way to expand the audience. <br><br><h4>  7. Freebie </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/b24/813/2c4/b248132c4ee6cd444618d3a2bc575bab.png"><br>  How many sweets in this word for simple tvitteryanena.  Make a simple page with a description of the draw.  You can play anything: from sets of souvenirs to expensive household appliances.  Ask everyone to win your twitter account and write a simple tweet with a link to the promo page.  For one <a href="http://turbomilk.ru/tshirts/">T-shirt per week</a> during the month, we increased the number of followers by almost 50%. <br><br>  Do not forget <a rel="external" href="https://twitter.com/signup">to get yourself a twitter</a> and, most importantly, subscribe to our @ <a rel="external" href="http://twitter.com/turbomilk">turbomilk</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/76433/">https://habr.com/ru/post/76433/</a></p>
