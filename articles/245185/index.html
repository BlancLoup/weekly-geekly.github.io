The role of the International Project Management Association (IPMA) in the formation of national standards of individual countries is presented. <br><br>  In 1986, the Software Engineering Institute (SEI) began the development of the Capability Maturity Model (CMM) software development capability based on the techniques described by Philip B. Grosby, a specialist and renowned lecturer in quality management, in his book ‚Äú Quality is Free ‚Äù[1].  The development was initiated by a request from the US Air Force, due to the urgent need to be able to assess the professionalism of contractors. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  CMM defines five levels of professionalism [2]: <br><br>  1. Initial - the development process is not under statistical control, there is no progress in improving processes. <br>  2. Repeatable - sustainable process with a renewable level of statistical control achieved through the application of meticulous project management in the field of labor costs, costs, timing and changes. <br>  3. Established - there is a well-established development process, internal quality standards, management understands the shortcomings of the practices.  Perhaps the successful introduction of advanced technologies. <br>  4. Managed - after a certain stage, you can initiate the analysis process.  Management is able to manage quality with the help of developed techniques. <br>  5. Optimized - the organization is in a constant process of improvement.

      As the CMM evaluation system was a questionnaire of 85 process and 16 technological issues, the standard itself became available to the public in 1988, a complete description of the CMM as a set of processes and practices corresponding to each level was released in 1991, in 1995 it was published in the book version [3].  Later, CMM was refined to a set of methodologies for improving processes in organizations: "Capability Maturity Model Integration" (CMMI), the latest (as of the end of 2014) version of CMMI-DEV, V1.3.  published in 2010, the following lists the process areas that are given attention in this standard [4]: <br><ul><li>  Cause Analysis and Resolution (CAR) </li><li>  Configuration Management (CM) </li><li>  Decision Analysis and Resolution (DAR) </li><li>  Project Integration Management (IPM) </li><li>  Measurement and Analysis (MA) </li><li>  Description of Organization Processes (OPD) </li><li>  Organization Focusing (OPF) </li><li>  Performance Management (OPM) </li><li>  Productive Organizational Process (OPP) </li><li>  Organizational Training (OT) </li><li>  Product Integration (PI) </li><li>  Project Monitoring and Control (PMC) </li><li>  Project Planning (PP) </li><li>  Quality Assurance for Products and Processes (PPQA) </li><li>  Quantitative Project Management (QPM) </li><li>  Requirements Development (RD) </li><li>  Requirements Management (REQM) </li><li>  Risk Management (RSKM) </li><li>  Supplier Contract Management (SAM) </li><li>  Technical Solution Development (TS) </li><li>  Validation (VAL) </li><li>  Verification (VER) </li></ul><br>  In 1989, the UK's Central Computer and Communication Agency (CCTA), later renamed State Trade Administration (OGC), created a structured project management system PRINCE (PR Projects IN Controlled Environments) based on the project management method PROMPT developed by Simpact Systems Ltd "In 1975 and approved by the CCTA as the standard for all government information system projects in the UK.  After its appearance, PRINCE effectively replaced the PROMPT.  Later, in 1996, an updated version of the PRINCE2 methodology was published, which was facilitated by a consortium of a total of about 150 European organizations [5]. <br><br>  PRINCE2 as a methodology largely overlaps and contributes to compliance with the international project management standard [6], so that it can be applied to any type of project.  Among other things, PRINCE applies a ‚Äúdeviation management‚Äù ensuring efficient use of the time of higher management personnel, and also provides an explicit distribution of roles and responsibilities, so everyone understands what is expected of them and what to expect from others.  PRINCE2 includes: a set of principles, control themes and a model of processes [7]. <br><br>  The principles of PRINCE2 contribute to the proper practice of introducing the methodology, preventing its excessive or superficial application and are derived in a practical way: <br><ul><li>  Long business case </li><li>  Learn from experience </li><li>  Distribution of roles and responsibilities </li><li>  Phased management </li><li>  Deviation Management </li><li>  Product focus </li><li>  Adaptation to the features of the project </li></ul><br>  The PRINCE2 topics represent those aspects of project management that should be addressed throughout the project life cycle, they determine how processes should be processed: <br><ul><li>  Economic justification </li><li>  Organization </li><li>  Quality </li><li>  Plans </li><li>  Risks </li><li>  Changes </li><li>  Progress </li></ul><br>  The process model consists of a set of activities that should be followed to guide, manage and complete the project: <br><ul><li>  Launch of the project </li><li>  Project management </li><li>  Project Initiation </li><li>  Stage Boundary Management </li><li>  Stage control </li><li>  Product Delivery Management </li><li>  Project closing </li></ul><br>  In February 1999, the International Project Management Association (IPMA), founded in 1965, as a non-profit professional association designed to bring together project management professionals, publishes the IPMA Competence Baseline (ICB) project management standard [ eight].  This standard contains the requirements for competencies imposed on project managers and members of project, program and portfolio management teams [9]. <br><br>  In Russia, IPMA appeared in 1990 as SOVNET.  At the moment, the association is engaged in teaching professional project management, accreditation of curricula for project management and international certification of specialists based on its own four-step system [10]: <br><br>  A - certified project director; <br>  B - Certified Senior Project Manager; <br>  C - certified project manager; <br>  D - Certified Project Management Specialist. <br><br>  The national representative offices of the association, based on the ICB, develop their own competency requirements, which should reflect national and cultural differences, following this logic. Sovnet published the standard: ‚ÄúFundamentals of professional knowledge and National competence requirements for project management specialists‚Äù (NTC), last edited from 2010 [11]. <br><br>  NTK considers a system project management model consisting of three main components: <br><br>  1. Objects of management - projects, programs and portfolios; <br>  2. Subjects of management - the investor, customer, team, manager and other interested parties. <br>  3. Management processes - are considered as a set of tasks and management procedures and are presented in sections: stages of the management process, functional area of ‚Äã‚Äãmanagement, time interval, object and subject of management.  The following stages of the management process are distinguished in NTC: <br><ul><li>  initiation (launch) of the project, </li><li>  project planning, </li><li>  organization and control of the project works, </li><li>  analysis and regulation of the project progress, </li><li>  closing the project. </li></ul><br>  According to the time interval, the processes are divided into: strategic - the entire life cycle of the project, annual, quarterly and operational - which includes tasks with the start of implementation from month to day.  Depending on the subject area in the STC, the following management functions are distinguished: <br><ul><li>  Project Domain Management </li><li>  Project management by time parameters </li><li>  Cost management and project financing </li><li>  Quality management in the project </li><li>  Project risk and opportunity management </li><li>  Human resource management in the project </li><li>  Management of communications in the project </li><li>  Procurement and contract management in the project </li><li>  Project Change Management </li><li>  Project Security Management </li></ul><br>  In addition to the above, the standard covers the areas of certification, international cooperation, project success criteria and issues of general competence, such as the organizational and technological maturity of a company in the field of project management.  As for behavioral competence, such issues as leadership and leadership, involvement and motivation, self-control, confidence and persuasiveness, tension relief, openness, creativity, focus on results, efficiency, coordination, negotiations, conflicts and crises, reliability , understanding values, ethics and problem solving. <br><br>  In 1996, the USA Project Management Institute (Project Management Institute, Inc., abbreviated PMI) published the A Guide to the Project Management Body of Knowledge (PMBOK Guide) [12], which describes the PMBOK project management standard.  This standard is compatible with the international project management standard ISO 9000. PMBOK combines an extensive set of knowledge and practices in the field of project management, as well as entire programs and project portfolios.  It focuses on the project life cycle, the impact of the organization, including its internal culture, on project management. <br><br>  The standard identifies a set of proven project management processes that can be used to increase the likelihood of success for a wide range of different projects, and the manual states that it is not necessary to use a complete list of processes and it is worth selecting those that will effectively achieve the goals of the selected project.  The standard processes are divided into the following groups [13]: <br><ul><li>  Project Management Process Group </li><li>  Initiation Process Group (2 processes) </li><li>  Planning Process Group (20 processes) </li><li>  Execution process group (8 processes) </li><li>  Group of monitoring and control processes (10 processes) </li><li>  Completion Process Group (2 processes) </li></ul><br>  In addition to management processes, the standard identifies project management knowledge areas, each of which represents a full-fledged set of practices in a selected area, for example, the project cost management section consists of assessment, budget and cost management sections; in total, the latest version of the edition offers 9 management knowledge areas projects: <br><ul><li>  Project Integration Management </li><li>  Project Content Management </li><li>  Project Time Management </li><li>  Project Cost Management </li><li>  Project Quality Management </li><li>  Human Resource Management Project </li><li>  Project Communication Management </li><li>  Project Risk Management </li><li>  Project Procurement Management </li></ul><br>  The interaction of management processes is shown in Appendix A. It is worth noting that, according to a study conducted by Ph.D. S. Gashik [14], the PMBOK processes are 95 percent similar to those described in the international project management standard ISO 21500 [15]. <br>  In November 2001, the Japan Project Management Professionals Certification Center (PMCC) for Japan, later renamed the Japan Project Management Association (Project Management Association of Japan, PMAJ), publishes the P2M Project Management Standard.  In the context of the methodology, managers are considered to achieve the mission of the project, who must have knowledge from related areas and are divided into three levels of professionalism: <br><ul><li>  specialist manager (PMS) </li><li>  Manager-Registered (PMR) and </li><li>  manager-architect (PMA). </li></ul><br>  P2M covers both project management and project program management, and includes management of the following areas of knowledge [15]: <br><ul><li>  Strategic Project Management </li><li>  Project Finance Management </li><li>  Project Management Systems </li><li>  Project Organizational Management </li><li>  Project Goals Management </li><li>  Project Resource Management </li><li>  Management of risks </li><li>  Information Management </li><li>  Project Relationship Management </li><li>  Project Cost Management </li><li>  Management of communications in the project </li></ul><br>  Thus, as a result of a review of information project management standards, it was possible to establish that in all of them one of the central groups of processes are the processes of risk and quality management of a project.  Moreover, most of the reviewed standards are interdisciplinary. <br><br>  The main standards applied in the field of project management are considered, the beginning of the development of the first of which dates from 1986, and the last in 2010, their inherent processes and features, intersections with international standards of project management.  The role of the International Project Management Association (IPMA) in the formation of national standards of individual countries is presented, the applicable levels for assessing the qualifications of companies and managers are given.  The study examined the following standards submitted by relevant organizations and countries: <br><ul><li>  CMMI - Software Engineering Institute (USA) </li><li>  PRINCE - Central Computer and Telecommunications Agency (UK) </li><li>  ICB - International Project Management Association (Switzerland) </li><li>  NTK - SOVNET (IPMA National Representation in Russia) </li><li>  PMBOK - Project Management Institute (USA) </li><li>  ISO 21500 - International Organization for Standardization </li><li>  P2M - Project Management Association of Japan (Japan) </li></ul><br><h4>  Bibliography </h4><br>  1.
