I like to read memoirs, in recent years, most often, on a space theme.  After a certain amount of books read, enough information accumulates to see the same events through the eyes of different people.  And here not only interesting additional details are discovered, but also facts from some memoirs contradicting the facts in other memoirs, and often official publications in the Soviet media.  Either the facts that are highly distorted by modern media.  For example, in the famous book by Boris Chertok, ‚ÄúRockets and People,‚Äù there is also such a text that causes questions when compared with other memoirs.  Reading recently the book of the American writer ‚ÄúInfinity Beckoned: Adventuring Through the Inner Solar System, 1969‚Äì1989‚Äù I discovered a number of ‚Äúinaccuracies‚Äù that did not affect the quality of the book, and were curiosities from the point of view of the Russian person, because  turned out to be translation errors from Russian to English, and I managed to trace one bright one to the book of another American author, who made an erroneous translation from Russian. <br><br><pre><code class="java hljs"><span class="hljs-comment"><span class="hljs-comment">/**   .     , --.  -  . */</span></span></code> </pre> <a name="habracut"></a><br>  Who was wrong, who quoted is not important.  The authors trust the books of other authors, media reports of the time, the memory of the participants in the events and often cannot verify the accuracy of the facts.  Boris Chertok included in his book the memoirs of colleagues and quotes from their books and, for example, about ‚ÄúVenus‚Äù, a verbatim fragment of the text from the book by O.G.  Ivanovsky "Start tomorrow at 9" because  Chertok himself did not participate in these events.

      Nevertheless, the memories of real participants in the events, supported by documents, photographic and film materials, are valuable and, often the only, memories of some ‚Äúinsignificant‚Äù events on a historical scale, but no less interesting for history lovers.  Here I will allow another remark - you should not blindly trust the Soviet newsreels and photographs of the Soviet era.  What I show in the photo from the memoirs: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/435/587/8e2/4355878e26d14555b05c393c75ccbdef.jpg" width="350"><br><br>  This photo does not have any relation to the lunar control center in Simferopol - this is easy to check by finding photos and videos from other angles that the unit behind is the receiving pressure chamber of the Institute of Geochemistry and Analytical Chemistry.

And I talked with the second for quite a long time, unaware of his biography, only periodically surprised at his knowledge of little-known facts from the history of Soviet cosmonautics, when suddenly the topic of conversation concerned this.  In the end, he told about his work in the 70s-80s, which he once gave a subscription to non-disclosure of state secrets.  It happened on April 12, 2016, when, in honor of the holiday, he showed several surviving artifacts and told several stories, one of which is in the title of this publication. <br><br>  Please consider that this is just a publication of several photos that have never been published before, and which has grown somewhat at the entrance to finding out ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs in the photo‚Äù.

The starting point will be this quote: <br><blockquote>  <i>A similar photo has not received such popularity even in Russia.</i>  <i>Although it was made by the Soviet automatic station Zond-7 on August 11, 1969.</i>  <i>In fact, it was an apparatus based on the Soyuz spacecraft and its flight to the moon was part of the program of the "lunar race".</i>  <i>But the race was lost, therefore, apparently, the results of this work were not particularly spread.</i> <br>  <a href="https://geektimes.ru/users/zelenyikot/" class="user_link">Zelenyikot</a> <a href="https://geektimes.ru/post/163433/">Earth through the eyes of an asteroid</a> </blockquote><br>  This quote on the first photo on the left (CDPV) is a half-truth.

Yes, and the topic for some may be "religious and political."  ) <br><br>  And so back to the topic.  My narrator‚Äôs name is Sergey Pavlovich (hereinafter abbreviated to SP) and once he provided the transmission of Central television reports from two Centers for Remote Space Communication (CDC) (NPC-10 and NPC-16 in the media were called CCDS, MCC, then just the Center - depending on the context, and in no case was information about their real location allowed.  Here is an example fragment of an article about the Lunokhod in ‚ÄúSpark‚Äù, where the journalist reported unclassified information about the real location: <br><blockquote>  ... at the Center for Remote Space Communications.  Although the sad bare steppe stretching to the horizon is only barely sprinkled with snow, and there are more and more Christmas trees.  Yes, in general, this is not a Christmas tree, but small pines. </blockquote><br>  And about the neighboring MCC, journalists reported something like this: <br><blockquote>  Huge eight-headed receiving antennas trembled and smoothly raised their bowls.  It became quiet in the spacious halls of the Center, so that it seemed as if blue-green snakes were pulsing signals on numerous screens, which now have the attention of operators.  The creators of the station bent over the graphs and columns of figures, checking their calculations with the data displayed on special boards.  Only the frivolous morning chirping of the birds was added to the rare short messages on the loudspeaker line and broke into the strict concentration of the premises of the Center, where the world of distant Venus reigned, broke into a purely earthly note. </blockquote><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/908/e0c/981/908e0c98192298f923f709062fdb971a.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Last summer, this building looked like this (specially planned to drop in here to see what changed there after the events, the anniversary of which was celebrated yesterday. Externally - new antennas appeared on the territory): <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/9d2/c1d/fd8/9d2c1dfd850547eda7fd88fa02dacac1.jpg" width="670"></a> <br><blockquote>  The console glows with colored lights ‚Äî blue and green pulses run across the oscillographs. <br>  - Tick-tick, tick-tack ‚Äî like a metronome, a device clicks.

There is! </blockquote><blockquote>  In the hall, where journalists sit, a long screen in the wall.  It shows the station‚Äôs entry into the atmosphere of the planet.  Below, on the left, on the outermost screen of the oscilloscope, the blue rhombus of the onboard radio transmitter signal pulses.  Above, the numbers counting seconds and minutes of Moscow time are rapidly changing.  "According to the updated data, the time of entry into the atmosphere ‚Äî 7 hours 58 minutes 44 seconds ‚Äî is announced along the speakerphone line ‚Äî the estimated time of the signal loss is 8 hours 02 minutes." </blockquote><blockquote>  Hooray!  There is a signal.  As if a sea of ‚Äã‚Äãsmiles spread around the room.  Everyone is happy.  Congratulate each other.  The signal is strong, good.  It is only five times weaker than what a directional antenna gave.  Now the blue ray of the oscilloscope records information that astronomers have dreamed of for centuries.  Radio signals will inform the Earth about the pressure, density, temperature of the atmosphere of the most mysterious planet of the solar system. </blockquote><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a74/a65/3d3/a74a653d3dbc4dbda01f5be13a428ca2.jpg" width="640"><br><br>  And this is how this ‚Äúneighboring TsUP‚Äù actually looked like, from where Soviet spacecraft were controlled - (described according to S. P.) a fragment of a hall with a number of operators' workstations along the wall, a computer terminal (seemingly to ‚ÄúMinsk-22‚Äù) and on the wall is a large digital display (the very Nixie-indicators, as they say now) with the parameters of the spacecraft.  Picture taken after work.  Therefore, everything is turned off in the photo and in the frame only an employee of the television is at his control (you can see a microphone, a video monitor).  This is the only photo of the ‚ÄúCenter Hall‚Äù known to me. <br><blockquote>  In 1975, the Mission Control Center near Moscow was commissioned.  In the fall of 1977, the new Salyut-6 station (DOS No. 5) was already controlled from the new MCC.  The stage of regular long manned flights began from this station in the space program.  The flight management service has been reorganized.  Instead of a semi-partisan gathering, similar to a Cossack army, a professional service with a clear structure of responsibility and separation of functions among stations, ships and shifts was created, consisting of several hundred specialists from different tribes going to the Black Sea. <br><br>  The formation of a professional flight control service, begun by Tregub, was completed with great enthusiasm by Alexey Eliseev.  He was credited with creating a clear structure and strict liability scheme at the stage of preparation and conduct of the flight.  LOCT as a temporary interdepartmental organization gradually died off.

On Geektimes there is an excellent article " </font></font><a href="https://geektimes.ru/post/252326/"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Flight to Venus and Mercury, or we sort and sort RAWki 40 years ago</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> ". You can envy such an approach to its history. In many ways, this is a dream for national history. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Will be published domestic photos? I doubt it, at least in the coming years.</font></font> S.P.<font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">about this crater shared his memories of the conversation in those days about these photos with experts - that if the photos were something that can not be explained, then the photos were classified. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The possibility that the United States could secretly carry out work on the surface of the moon was seriously assumed. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The publication of the photo would allow the United States to find out that their object could no longer be so secret for the USSR and take certain measures. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Declassification of what has not been interesting to anyone for a long time still remains a problem now. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Easier to destroy. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Well written about this in this quote from the memoirs.</font></font><br><blockquote>  Today, at the astronauts' house, a regime officer stopped me.  I was warned that if I am going to write to the newspaper on any topic, then the text must first be coordinated in a special commission of the Center. <br><br>  It turns out this is a whole procedure.<font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Here is a sample of the document to be compiled and agreed to in order to have the right to send a note to the newspaper. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Let it be even a few lines.</font></font><br>  First, it is necessary to compile an author's certificate, in which it is necessary to indicate that there is no secret information or similar information in my text.  My signature must certify the command of the Center.  This is my guarantee. <br><br>  Secondly, it is necessary to fill out and sign with the members of the commission an ‚ÄúAct of examination of materials prepared for open publication‚Äù.  The act to approve the commander of the unit (the head of the Center). <br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> The correctness of each paragraph of the act must be proved to each member of the commission and the commander. </font></font><br>  So now I understand those military men who do not want to get involved in the press. <br> <a href="http://kik-sssr.ru/download/1970-1979_Amerikanskoe_vremja.pdf">   ¬´  .</a>  <a href="http://kik-sssr.ru/download/1970-1979_Amerikanskoe_vremja.pdf">American time.</a> <a href="http://kik-sssr.ru/download/1970-1979_Amerikanskoe_vremja.pdf">1970‚Äì1979 ¬ª</a> <br></blockquote><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">As far as I know, approximately since 2009, the control over the regime and the trickle of what fell semi-legally from the archives, museums of the military-industrial complex factories, in the 2000s, dried up again. And no one has a desire to get involved in the official procedure for declassifying and publishing materials (in fact, this is voluntary, the work is not funded and responsibility is taken). </font></font><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/2cd/d06/79e/2cdd0679e4f1468a91146f5cd2f4b7c8.jpg"><br> <i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">(Photo by Luna-16 from a private collection.

Then there was information on the subject of Lunokhod that was interesting to me, and if by the end of the 2000s there were only a few remarkable publications in newspapers and TV stories, now a large amount of documentary materials are available, interviews of participants and publications for different years. But some details in the publications do not pay attention. For example, there is practically no detailed technical description of both the consoles and the lunar rover itself. In general, the scheme of the transmitter of the first Satellite in the network appeared quite recently. Apparently a big secret. </font></font><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b0f/981/30e/b0f98130e7b54d8ca5a1a7c06b61a4aa.jpg"><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I wonder </font></font><a href="https://geektimes.ru/post/282258/"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">if</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> something </font></font><a href="https://geektimes.ru/users/maxgorbunov/" class="user_link"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">happened maxgorbunov</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> ?</font></font><br><blockquote>  Thank!  Yes, that is right.  In connection with the article, I talk with the representative of the leadership of the RKS: maybe it will be possible to make public the materials on the first satellites. </blockquote><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">While the state is not going to finance the publication of historical documents, the interested people are ‚Äúready to buy.‚Äù And sometimes you can officially buy something - I find very interesting pictures about the history of astronautics and technology of the USSR in the photobank </font></font><a href="http://sputnikimages.com/en/site/gallery/index/id/70797/"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Sputnik</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> (VisualRian). The only thing that the signatures may contain errors, and the photos themselves are mirrored. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">This sadness is brightened up by private initiatives - history buffs who, with their money and free work, ‚Äúmine‚Äù, store and publish historical materials. For example, they are raising money for digitizing Soviet space films from film archives (there are these comrades, for example, on rutracker with distributions). An important work at their own expense in preserving space history is done by the owners of the resources </font></font><a href="http://epizodsspace.no-ip.org/"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">epizodsspace.no-ip.org</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">(http://epizodyspace.ru) and </font></font><a href="http://www.kik-sssr.ru/"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">www.kik-sssr.ru</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> .

Most of the Soviet space photographs, the panoramas of Venus were generally in digital form due to personal means and the great desire to get these photos of one person. A former Microsoft programmer from Redmond in the early 2000s found contacts and paid for digitizing Soviet images stored at the Space Research Institute, if I'm not mistaken. The pictures were used when writing articles on </font></font><a href="http://mentallandscape.com/V_Venus.htm"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">his website</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> .

And the only ones who can tell about it are living witnesses of events. Unless of course ask them about it. What I asked S.P.</font></font> because<font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">He participated in providing live broadcast of the Central Television from the Lunokhod Control Center. So it looked for viewers and readers of the Soviet press. </font></font><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/97b/c31/85d/97bc3185d7714c9db0353056a2941d38.jpg"><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And so it was in fact: </font></font><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f1d/d44/325/f1dd4432523b4b1aa13996b7b9c1d287.jpg" width="250"><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">By the way, the direction of the shooting was due to the fact that there was nothing secret in the background. </font></font><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e8d/71c/0c5/e8d71c0c547e4170a6fa4b37fdb93819.jpg"><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The modern view of the lunodrome from about the same place and in the same direction: </font></font><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/6e8/79e/b8d/6e879eb8d49c44eca0e57548a9724e60.jpg"><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">According to S.P. This is one of the first Soviet television cameras for outdoor shooting. The camera itself weighed about 60 kg and about the same tripod. The camera was connected by more than a kilometer cable to their mobile television studio (PTS), with which the directional antenna transmitted the signal to the television center antenna and the relay communication line to Moscow. Memories of how they dragged him on his lunodrome are fresh.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In a recent interview, V.Dovgan said that the joystick was called a ‚Äújoystick‚Äù (kn√ºppel), as it turned out, the word familiar to the military of some specialties and military-industrial complex engineers, and transferred from them to the ‚Äúcivil language‚Äù in the era of the emergence of personal computers as a local competitor to the word ‚Äú joystick". He also told a little about how he managed - the joystick was set to the required position and a button was pressed at the end of the handle, confirming the sending of the command. But there is no information about the remaining details of the consoles. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I was interested in a few questions for a long time: the pens on the video monitor, the round groove below and to the left of the screen, the device to which the commander points in the picture with his finger, the flat device standing on the left side of the driver‚Äôs console, and many more small things in the photo and film shots.</font></font><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/061/089/41c/06108941cb32420294505b447d1e57d2.jpg" width="640"><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">TV crews worked with the crew and at the Lunokhod control point. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Thanks to S.P. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I explained the purpose of the details in the photographs of the remote controls of the moon rover. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And by the way, the TV people worked not only there.</font></font> S.P.<font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">said that the room in the hotel "Ukraine" (Simferopol) at the drivers of the Lunokhod "Glory and Gena" was very conveniently located near the buffet. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Communication was not interrupted for a long time. </font></font><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/70d/7d8/f81/70d7d8f811614fce822292724d8790cb.jpg"><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">On the left panel of the commander‚Äôs console there is only one device that turned out to be for hours. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And the flat device with a thick cable on the left side of the driver‚Äôs console turned out to be an indicator of the TV frame number. </font></font><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/1c6/83e/ea5/1c683eea57d74ee1a8c825381182a0e4.jpg" width="640"><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The rest of the points above i were arranged by the book of the driver of the lunar rover V. Dovgana </font></font><a href="http://coollib.com/b/341968"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Moonlight Odyssey of the Russian Cosmonautics. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">From the "Dream" to moon rovers.</font></font></a>  .<font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In particular, it turned out the number of the television frame and the time imprinted on the film. Such as EXIF ‚Äã‚Äãand teleframe archiving. Do they ever digitize them all? I would like to see with reference to the terrain, for example, in Google Moon. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Vyacheslav Dovgan, in fact, the only source of memories of moon rovers. His interview, publication is actually the only thing that can be found. His book summarizes and clarifies a lot of scattered information into a single picture. Refutes the speculations of the yellow press, describing how events actually happened. Although the consoles and jobs Vyacheslav Dovgan and not described in full. White spots in these issues S.P. erased simple answers.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">A microphone and a box with speaker slots under the phone are a speakerphone. Dovgan writes that at first they tried to work with headphones - it turned out to be inconvenient. </font></font><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/9ab/667/294/9ab667294ef34f638bf0788398a3cef0.jpg" width="640"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/18a/03c/1f7/18a03c1f732f480fb41424c7a521ad4e.jpg" width="640"><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Two pens on the monitor - the monitor turns out to be a separate device that simply lies on the ‚Äúcarriage‚Äù. In the event of a breakdown, it was quickly picked up with two handles and replaced with a spare. And two pens because it was lifted by two people - the monitor weighed about 30 kg, about half of the mass falls on the supply transformer. </font></font><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/91f/632/b9d/91f632b9d7fb4c3094009cc438baa27f.JPG" width="640"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/907/232/2b3/9072322b3dbc46abbe6c07e8a5b39ef9.jpg" width="640"><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And finally, ‚Äúthe handles on the video monitor, the circular groove below and to the left of the screen‚Äù - the handles are the usual television picture settings. A ‚Äúround groove‚Äù turned out to be another screen ‚Äî an oscilloscope showing the presence of a signal.</font></font> Since<font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> the picture on the video monitor screen was rarely updated, then the osciloscope made it possible to immediately understand that something had happened and there would be no next picture. </font></font><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/014/fee/072/014fee072b6043bcbd8a1a93aa4333d3.jpg" width="640"><br><br>  That's all. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/392863/">https://habr.com/ru/post/392863/</a></p>
