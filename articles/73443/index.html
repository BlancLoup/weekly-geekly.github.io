  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Learn to drink beautifully and skillfully</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img src="http://winegame.ru/images/som2.JPG" alt="image"><br><br>  You have never had such a feeling: You, an alcoholic with experience, who by virtue of experience can distinguish a Siberian from a Baltic, and again due to an experience unable to distinguish Cranes from a green brand, go to the store with friends / girl / parents / colleagues to buy alcohol for any reason or without it.  Choose a beer (I usually take five boxes of a dark ‚Äúgoat‚Äù and a couple of boxes of ‚Äúany-light-all-up-to-50-rubles-taste-not-especially-different‚Äù), champagne (either ‚Äúwhich is cheaper‚Äù, or ‚Äú Abrau Durso ", or" you can hang out and take asti "), whiskey (if with coke, then chivas - upper price ceiling, if without coke - then lower), all sorts of liqueurs from Beilis to sambuka, any 40 + degree drinks - from rum and gin to tequila and absinthe, and then come to the long racks of wine.  Bl * be. <a name="habracut"></a>  What limits your knowledge of wine?  The fact that tasty white is made in chili, and tasty red - in France?  The fact that white goes to the fish, and red - to the meat?  At best, you know that old wine tends to drain along the wall longer. <br><br>  It is here that one wants to prove oneself (especially if one has to drink often on duty / friendship).  Impress with the ability to do sambuca or b-52 is difficult today, and the ability to mix a delicious long island on the eye "swinging" for a couple of meetings with friends.  But if it is appropriate to name a bouquet of aromas in wine, guessing the grape varieties and its place of origin, or simply choose a wine in the store that you like yourself and those around you, then get a couple of ‚Äúadvantages‚Äù in the eyes of the audience (whether it is drinking or not) and raise ChSV - you can.

      Courses wine sommeliers can take place far from everywhere, they require you to devote a fixed amount of time to yourself and in our time are quite significant amounts (5-6-digit) money. <br><br>  Now it's time for a little advertisement. <br><br>  A few decades ago, <s>British scientists</s> French <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25AD%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BB%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B3%25D0%25B8%25D1%258F">enologists</a> came up with one interesting thing, which currently forms the basis of wine sommelier courses.  It lies in the fact that a person is taught to avoid visual associations with certain smells (that is, most of us feel the light aroma of strawberries without seeing strawberries, will not be able to determine what they smell like strawberries, although it will seem to them very much familiar) and to distinguish smells and bouquets of smells, without seeing the object-association.  A few years later, smart people thought: ‚ÄúEveryone can learn the names of the grape varieties and the place of their growth, choosing a wine for a particular food by buying a book and reading it.  So why not give those who wish something little else that is necessary for the fullest understanding of such a multi-faceted thing like wine?  And yes, of course, make money on it. ‚ÄùThus, the Wine Discovery game appeared, which has been successfully sold in the West for several years.  It combines the element of the game (you can play even ten together), knowledge of oenology (perhaps not the most applied knowledge, but definitely useful) and develops the sense of smell (which among city dwellers is often able to distinguish only the smell of air fresheners in the car and different types of coffee ). <br><br>  This game is still sold in Europe, for example, in Foggy Albion, you can <a href="http://www.nezduvin.co.uk/nezduvin_duo.htm">buy it</a> for 140 pounds (set for 24 bottles).  In France, it costs about 200 Euros in regular stores.  In Russia, it is almost impossible to buy, and what it is is about 700 Euros.  Guess what I want to offer you? <br><br>  <a href="http://winegame.ru/index.htm">True, I want to offer you to buy it cheaper and completely in Russian.</a> <br><br>  Especially there is no need to copy the contents of the site, so I will list only the main advantages of this miracle of enological thought and, perhaps, its only drawback: <br>  + A great gift to a wide range of people (colleagues, business partners, friends, parents - all who do not suffer from chronic rhinitis) <br>  + all in Russian (no PROMT, the <i>only skill used is competent manual translation</i> ) <br>  + "Pumping" of smell and ChSV <br>  + Great game for a dozen or two evenings in any company. <br>  + almost complete lack of analogues (original gift, pancake) and a great price in comparison with few sources (yes, and the variety of flavors is also wider) <br>  - the game is not for "snotty" (although they can read) <br><br>  <b>PS Initially, my goal was to attract a person who is able to optimize a site for its ‚Äúpromotion‚Äù in search engines (to be honest, I still pursue it), but after thinking about it, I decided, first of all (which is really true), to attract quite yet a broad base of drinking / drinking compatriots, secondly, to contribute to the training of compatriots in the culture of proper drinking, and thirdly, to listen to comments about the site itself.</b>  <b>For the last I will be extremely grateful.</b> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/73443/">https://habr.com/ru/post/73443/</a></p>
