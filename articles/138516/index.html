  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Can I sell goods abroad through Google Checkout?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Once I caught fire to buy a pair of brand shoes, on which I set aside my hard-earned money in advance.  And since I myself have been engaged in sales through the Internet for several years, I decided to support my colleague, a virtual merchant, by purchasing the goods I needed in one of the online stores. <br><br>  For a long time I couldn‚Äôt choose which store to buy me, as some never bought such shoes, while others offered to order this unfortunate pair of shoes to order, which naturally did not suit me.  A few hours later, I finally came across a decent online store that met all my requirements. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  After I found the shoes I liked so much, the seller offered to settle with him through the Google Checkout payment system.  At first, I was confused.  I will not say that I have never heard of this system, but I certainly didn‚Äôt have to deal with it, which is why I was a little embarrassed, fearing that problems might arise when paying. 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>

        </script>
      <br>
      Problems, fortunately, did not arise, payment went quickly and without any delay.  Fortunately, I had already registered a Google account, to which my Visa card was simply tied.  In due time, the long-awaited shoes appeared in the nearest post office, to which it was necessary to walk, about five minutes. <br><br>  This system seemed to me very convenient, and I thought about how I would make my sales, receiving payments from customers through this Google product.  Began a long and painful search on search engines, which, unfortunately, did not satisfy me.  And then it hit me: what if you write a post where you can share this problem with readers?  Surely there will be those who contacted this payment system and started a merchant account there, which means they will be able to talk about it more than just the information from the site. <br><br>  For example, I would like to know how convenient this system is for the seller and is it worth contacting her?  Or why many online stores prefer it to other payment systems, such as PayPal and others?  What are her pitfalls, and what are the advantages that help an online merchant in his difficult task? <br><br>  On the official Google Checkout website, I received answers to questions regarding reliability, interest withdrawal, and many others, but I would like to learn how it works from the personal experience of readers, since practice tends to diverge from theory. <br><br>  Despite the fact that the legal territory of this payment system is the USA, it also interests virtual sellers from the countries of the former Soviet Union.  Most of the CIS countries have recently been engaged only in what they are adopting the experience of foreign competitors, why not learn from working with their payment systems, which, in my opinion, are very convenient. <br><br>  I think the experience of my readers will certainly be useful not only for me and more experienced salespeople, but also for those who have just stepped onto the path of distance selling, hoping to sell their goods quickly using reliable tools.  Write, share your experience, ask questions that will help to fully open the topic: ‚ÄúCan I sell goods abroad through Google Checkout?‚Äù And trade in my own finished product. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/138516/">https://habr.com/ru/post/138516/</a></p>
