  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Electronic document management. Real example</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The electronic document management system ‚ÄúDelo‚Äù functioned at the enterprise for a long time after I appeared there.  But in the two years of my participation, I figured out quite well how everything was arranged on the hood.  About how it all works, I will tell you about some jambs right now. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h2>  Hi, document flow </h2><br>  Let's begin our acquaintance with document circulation, taking on the role of a simple head of department.  Let our department is responsible for the repair of the premises.  So, we woke up in the morning, stood in Moscow corks and finally found ourselves in our cozy office.  After drinking the coffee, we load the computer and open the Case.  We see folders: incoming, for execution, under control.  The third folder (on control) is not accessible to everyone, but only to those who are close enough to power. <br><br>  Open the inbox.  There are a couple of documents.  Here came a document that, if desired, you can come to such and such training then.  We just remove it from the office.  The following document contains the order of some higher official, that it is necessary to throw the wiring on the third floor.  Click on the "accept for execution" button.  <i>In fact, such documents in the morning may come not 2, but dozens.</i>  <i>Not all of them are worthy of attention, some get into the mailing list for "all users."</i>  <i>Therefore, often, it‚Äôs not the boss himself who is leading the job of clearing the inbox, but his assistant.</i>  <i>Assistant brings to the head only the most important points.</i> 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"

      <br>
      Open the folder <b>for execution</b> .  At the very top of the posting document.  His term does not fit, you can not worry.  But still we go into it.  Click "add a subordinate resolution" and send this document to the electricians.  The following document is red.  What is he so?  And, on it it was necessary to send the report yesterday.  Well, nothing, not very scary.  We go inside and write a report.  Suppose the document was about painting the bench.  We write: ‚ÄúThe shop is painted in such a color‚Äù and attach a photo.  <i>If you just write "the order is executed", there will be a-ta-ta.</i>  <i>It is necessary to prove.</i> <br>  <i>* Two days have passed *</i> <br>  Now the wiring instruction is red.  We go into it.  Inside we see a report on the work done by electricians.  We send the assistant to check whether everything is executed correctly.  Yes, indeed, everything is so.  Click send report, attach evidence.  After some time, the controller removes this instruction. If he doesn‚Äôt withdraw, then we call him by phone, we‚Äôll find out if we ask you to remove everything. <br><br>  The <b>control</b> folder is accessible only to a limited number of users.  Only those who can give instructions to the heads of departments and control them.  Everything is simple: a report came from all the performers about the task that was executed, clicked to remove it from control.  I did not like the report: I took the phone, dialed the number of the contractor and made all the recommendations for implementation. <br><br>  The situation described above is completely invented.  In reality, problems such as a flashing light are solved through an application by telephone.  But I could not come up with a better example, without delving into the internal processes. <br><br><h2>  The life of the document </h2><br>  The document is created in the depths of the enterprise (typed in a Word, printed on a sheet of paper), signed by all the necessary managers and enduring persons (I remind you, all signatures are still on paper).  Then this document goes to the documentation circulation department (in our office).  There are a lot of people in this department and they have very cool and expensive scanners, ready to scan page by page, spending less than a second on each page.  Our document is being scanned.  It is automatically assigned a number (consisting of an index, which shows what type of document the document belongs to, and a sequence number from the beginning of the year).  Then the registrar (office employee) manually enters the rubric and information about what the document is about (thanks to the text recognizer, which significantly speeds up this work).  In the next step, the registrar sends the document to the private offices of those who need to see it.  The list of those who send the document to the creator indicates on the reverse side.  For sample documents that make up the bulk, ready-made mailing lists have already been carefully created by us in the ‚ÄúBusiness‚Äù program, so the mailing often takes a couple of clicks.  From this point on, the document remains in the system forever.  And the original on paper is removed in the closet. <br><br>  With the usual document work is completed.  He got into the offices of those users who need.  Those who need it can find it by number, content, date, category.  Of course, if users have enough rights to view it.  With the control instruction the work is not finished.  The registrar puts down all performers and controllers.  As well as the dates by which the instructions must be executed.  Now this document will not disappear from the folder for execution and under the control of the contractor and the controller, respectively. <br><br><h2>  On paper, all is well.  And how does Delo actually work? </h2><br>  In general, everything works as it should.  There are <u><i>almost</i></u> no complaints <u><i>about the</i></u> software and its logic.  But the human factor plays a big role in the whole process.  Someone looks into the system according to the regulations twice a day, and who was there only once.  The only way to motivate quality work: monetary.  Our quarterly bonus depends directly on the number of outstanding and overdue orders.  More precisely, there is an inverse relationship. <br><br>  Separate question with setting rights.  There are a lot of them and they are configured in different places.  That is why the word is <i>almost</i> the previous paragraph.  There are different access bars.  For example, there is a neck <b>personal data</b> .  Documents marked with this stamp can not be found through the search.  It can be opened only if he came to the office.  It happens that the document has been removed from the office, as it is no longer needed, but here it is needed again.  Users have to call and ask to send them this document again. <br><br>  The rest of the system is reliable, like a mammoth.  For 2 years there were no technical problems.  But it looks the same: a typical office program of the 90s.  Now a browser version has been released that looks easier.  Most of the employees have been transferred to it, since it greatly simplifies administration: it is not necessary to install a program on each user's computer. <br><br><h2>  Bonus section </h2><br>  In my last <a href="http://megamozg.ru/post/23150/">post</a> <a href="https://megamozg.ru/users/zhavoronok/" class="user_link">zhavoronok</a> asked a number of questions that I will try to answer. <br><br><blockquote>  How does those.  support? </blockquote>  To support no complaints at all.  Always (during working hours) in touch by mail and telephone.  In the questions go deep, they know their products well. <br>  Separately, I want to note the documentation on the use.  These are several volumes of thick books in which absolutely all the checkboxes, parameters, buttons are described.  Painted everything for fools.  But very often it helps.  Unfortunately, the latest versions do not have printed documentation. <br><br><blockquote>  How difficult is it to refine yourself? </blockquote>  It‚Äôs simply not possible to customize yourself.  Source code is closed.  All we can do is buy options. <br><br><blockquote>  Did expectations coincide with reality? </blockquote>  The product was bought for a long time, before my arrival at work.  But, I think, expectations have surpassed reality, since initially this product was purchased as a system for monitoring the execution of orders. <br><br><blockquote>  What is the cost of ownership per year in your case </blockquote>  I cannot answer this question because I do not have such information. <br><br><blockquote>  Do you have it connected with ERP, how easily can you connect </blockquote>  As far as I know, the point is not connected with ERP and the automatic import of information does not occur.  But, if necessary, you can use api, which, of course, is purchased separately.  Api is now used for friendship with 1C. <br><br><blockquote>  What is done well and what is bad? </blockquote>  Well, that product quality.  It is bad that sometimes it is difficult to deploy for specific needs. <br><br><blockquote>  What needs covered </blockquote>  No one else has the right to say: "I did not see, I did not hear, the document was lost." </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/297770/">https://habr.com/ru/post/297770/</a></p>
