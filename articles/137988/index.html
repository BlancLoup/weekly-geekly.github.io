  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Some news about Stanford University courses for 2012</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Many people have heard about courses at Stanford University in 2012. The 2011 courses showed a very good quality of material and a high level of teaching.  Courses for 2012 looked even more interesting and exciting.  Classes were supposed to start in January-February 2012, but in January, the courses did not start (which is no longer news), and now, by the middle of February, a few more news appeared, I ask all interested under the cat. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  I'll start with the bad news.  Unfortunately, for unknown reasons (at least I did not find any mention of why), but instead of 16 planned courses there will most likely be only 14. ‚ÄúMost likely‚Äù, because the information comes in a bit contradictory.  From the initial list of 16 courses, the ‚ÄúTechnology Entrepreneurship‚Äù and ‚ÄúLean Launchpad‚Äù courses were removed, unfortunately it was these courses that scored the most interested listeners (more than 67K people).  The contradiction lies in the fact that it is quite possible that the ‚ÄúLean Launchpad‚Äù course still comes out, but with a ‚Äúslight‚Äù delay of 60 days.  As the lecturer of the course Steve Blank explained, while developing the lectures for the current course, he suddenly realized that some materials were morally outdated, and he wants to bring as much modern work as possible into the lectures, which is why the delay (found <a href="https://plus.google.com/107809899089663019971/posts/gUiPb1156Ld">here</a> ).  I really hope that something similar happened with the ‚ÄúTechnology Entrepreneurship‚Äù and both courses will begin with a delay of a couple of months.  At the moment both courses are not in the list, the sites dedicated to the courses do not work.  The website of the Technology Entrepreneurship course is completely stopped, the website of the Lean Launchpad course is redirected to the Steve website.

      Now a little about the good, at least 2 courses promise to start from February 20.  These are ‚ÄúModel Thinking‚Äù and ‚ÄúSoftware Engineering for SaaS‚Äù.  From both courses came the corresponding notification letters.  Both courses offer some background material. <br><br>  For the ‚ÄúModel Thinking‚Äù provided 2 first lectures that are available <a href="https://www.coursera.org/modelthinking/lecture/preview">here</a> .  Unfortunately, some of the lectures have small bugs, so be vigilant.  The lectures incorporate small tests and sometimes after sending the data and clicking on the ‚ÄúContinue‚Äù button, instead of continuing the lecture, you move to the next lecture.  Maybe this will fix when the courses begin. <br><br>  For Software Engineering for SaaS, an alpha version of the book on the course is provided, you can also download a Virtual Box image with pre-installed software that will be used in the course.  Get acquainted with the materials or download the software <a href="http://beta.saasbook.info/">here</a> .  Unfortunately the book is paid, despite the alpha version.  The print version costs 19.99 dollars on Amazon, the kindle version costs 9.99 dollars.  The versions for Nook and iBooks also promise, but still the presence of paid materials is somehow not encouraging.  It is possible to get acquainted with the first chapter for free when buying a Kindle version. <br><br>  There were still some details about the courses in general.  Initially, it was reported that the courses are conducted by Stanford University and perhaps it was in 2011, but as reported by <a href="https://plus.google.com/107809899089663019971/posts/4VuN2RsRggB">Class Central,</a> current courses are based on the <a href="https://www.coursera.org/">Coursera</a> platform, and Coursera is a startup created by Professor Daphne Koller (DB class lecturer) and Professor Andrew Ng (lecturer Machine learning class), at the moment they have several vacancies for developers on the site.  Thus, it turns out that the courses are officially conducted not by Stanford University, but by a separate company that can hire lecturers from anywhere (currently most of the lecturers from Stanford and several from Berkeley).  Correct me if I'm wrong. <br><br>  Here are the news, thank you for your attention. <br><br>  References: <br>  <a href="https://plus.google.com/107809899089663019971/posts">Class Central</a> - various course news <br>  <a href="http://www.cs101-class.org/hub.php">Coursera</a> - current course site </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/137988/">https://habr.com/ru/post/137988/</a></p>
