The state is not always us</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"> A MSU student rushed to ISIS, tsat Chechen guys rushing to Syria, managed to stop at the border, etc.  Do you think a new trend is passing you, your friends and loved ones?  Not ISIS, so the sect of ‚Äúgod Kuzi‚Äù, dietary supplements from old age, football fans, drugs in schools, institutes and ‚Äúdiscos‚Äù - the modern world is multifaceted in its temptations.  How to deal with the new evil, how to <b>protect your loved ones</b> and loved ones in time?  After all, neither Google nor Yandex are helpers here ... <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ca2/53f/d17/ca253fd173ce44af8101f1fe4dd24101.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The topic is extensive and serious - not to cover everything with one article.  And, unfortunately, society and governments in different countries of the world react in every way - mostly late, not on a large scale and in no way strategically.  So it makes sense to rely first of all on yourself.

      First, a few common "scary" numbers: <br>  - Humanity generates <b>30 billion messages</b> <b>daily</b> (tweets, PM, mail, comments, etc.); <br>  - From this ocean, the shouts are <b>public</b> - about <b>2 billion</b> ; <br>  - Russian-speaking stream of public (open to all) messages - about <b>50 million</b> . <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  For those who like to see the structure of sources and social networks, including Megamind with Habr - here is a <a href="http://br-analytics.ru/statistics">link to the <b>online scoreboard on 10,000+ resources</b></a> : <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/47b/9ed/28e/47b9ed28e13b4c2b8381b58b9dc569e0.gif" alt="image"><br><br>  Further - more: <b>media</b> materials <b>, including discussions</b> and comments on articles, account for only ... <b>0.6% of the</b> data generated by mankind.  Therefore, it is not surprising that in just 3 years the database of messages in Brand Analytics - the largest archive of Russian-language social media and media - has already <b>doubled the</b> number of indexed pages in the Yandex database. <br><br>  Without going into details (Big Data, Data Sience, linguistics, etc.), it is important to understand: <br><br>  1. No one will bother you with information on the Internet, <b>if a person doesn‚Äôt take the first step</b> , he will join the group, subscribe to someone‚Äôs Twitter account, respond to a request in a personal, put all the ‚Äúinsider‚Äù information about himself in his profile and its many, even if unaddressed, messages, photos and videos. <br><br>  2. Corollary from item 1: monitoring of activity allows detecting at a very early stage, still <b>in the phase of ‚Äúattention grabbing‚Äù</b> , contact with future adverse consequences. <br><br>  3. Monitoring is <b>thematic (event) or object (person or group, position)</b> .  Examples of thematic monitoring: the Olympic Games, housing and public utilities prices increase, paid parking.  Examples of object monitoring: your account in VK, comments on the article of the top blogger. <br><br>  The state is obliged (you can throw a brick at me, but do not forget to pick it up when your friend or daughter is in a difficult situation, yielding to a lure in social networks) to be engaged in thematic monitoring in social media.  In China, everything is done in advance and according to the mind, in Russia - so far at the level of Roskomnadzor's postreaction on media sites and equals to them, for example, top bloggers and VKontakte groups.  Therefore, in China, 200 people are imprisoned in a couple of hours for panic in communications during the stock exchange crisis, while in Russia the series Roskomnadzor against all, including themselves, lasts for months, while the Internet is swarming with fraudsters. <br><br>  For those who did not pay attention, I emphasize: the state is obliged to engage in <b>THEMATIC (event-based) monitoring</b> , as well as conduct outreach work among people, especially young people and children, and methods of protection during non-public communication with unknown people.  Object monitoring activities are on the people themselves: first of all, we ourselves are responsible for our relatives and friends, and each family itself follows its own foundations - is there any smell of alcohol from the 8th grader of the son, or from which hangover the daughter began to wear a mini-hedgehog skirts. <br><br>  Below will be given a translation of two articles describing the dynamics of the state option, according to which the country N2 went by population - <b>India</b> - in which people are also exposed to a huge online impact on religious, ethnic, economic grounds. <br><br>  For those who are finally thinking about the safety of their surroundings, I advise you to try some tools of object monitoring of social media.  You can consider advertising, but it is better to turn your head on and see what tools we now have to deal with new challenges?  - Recently, our colleagues from Brand Analytics launched a simple monitoring service of Russian-speaking social media - BA Express, which allows, among other things, to look at the references to people, social network accounts, used nicknames, etc. A good start to quickly check yourself and your loved ones ‚Äúfor free‚Äù - 100 Mention is made when registering with Express, and if you and your community are not specifically mentioned anywhere, then the free will last for a long time.  And then someday the state will take care of its tasks so that parents do not rush to Turkey, pull their daughter out of the hands of fanatics. <br><br>  <a href="http://br-analytics.ru/express/">BA Express Link</a> : <a href="http://br-analytics.ru/express/">br-analytics.ru/express</a> <br><br>  The articles on India are dated March (last November 2014 events) and this September 2015, clearly show the dynamics of the state approach to the tasks of monitoring the information field during the year - from a narrow urban ‚Äúpolice‚Äù object approach to a state thematic, with a wide range of tasks both within the country and abroad. <br><br>  ====== <br>  <b><i>March 2015</i></b> <b><br></b>  <b><a href="http://www.zdnet.com/article/india-sets-up-social-media-monitoring-lab/">India is setting up a social media monitoring lab.</a></b> <b><a href="http://www.zdnet.com/article/india-sets-up-social-media-monitoring-lab/"><br></a></b> <br>  Mumbai police have set up a framework for monitoring social networks to identify public sentiment in order to identify situations that could lead to mass demonstrations or protests. <br><br>  A specially trained team of 20 police officers, employees of the Social Media Lab, daily and nightly monitor publicly discussed issues, tracking changes in popular sentiment that can lead to large-scale meetings or protests. <br><br>  The Social Media Lab, opened by bollywood actor Abhishek Bachchan, will assess people's attitudes on social media.  They will also monitor particularly active Internet citizens on Twitter, Facebook, Google+ and other social networks.  In other words, the police will keep online activists under tight surveillance. <br><br>  In November 2014, the actions of the Mumbai police provoked outrage and fierce disputes over Indian Internet laws after the arrest of two young girls for posts on Facebook, criticizing the actions of the Mumbai police following the death of a local politician.  This was followed by several arrests throughout India for political cartoons or comments written on the Internet. <br><br>  Naturally, the question arises of freedom of expression and the rights of Indian citizens.  However, the average social media user will not have to change his behavior and habits, since this observation is in no way connected with censorship.  The task of the Social Media Lab is to prevent demonstrations and protests that can undermine the livelihoods of not only a large city, but the entire state. <br><br>  Moreover, most of the police stations in India, such as in the city of Delhi, already have their own cyber-cells, actively supporting law and order.  Delhi Police is active on Facebook and Twitter, not only watching users (for crimes), but also maintains a real-time traffic map of the city. <br><br>  Millions of teenagers from all over India are already actively using social media.  Therefore, a certain form of moderation and monitoring is necessary, especially for people at an early age, in order to prevent cases of cyber-harassment and possible crimes in time. <br><br>  Of course, the Freedom of Expression vs Online Monitoring debate will always be there, but social media users should realize that monitoring public messages helps protect the safety of people, both on and off the Internet.  The media usually talks only about how the online police are arresting someone, although they are also actively working to ensure the safety of people and their loved ones across India. <br><br>  According to experts in the field of social media, the volume of data of public messages (tweets, posts, comments) is so great that it is almost impossible to ensure full-scale monitoring.  Therefore, the police will first allocate users who have already been convicted, or have antisocial or anti-national views and monitor their activities on the Internet. <br><br>  ====== <br><br>  <b><i>September 2015</i></b> <b><br></b>  <b><a href="http://sputniknews.com/asia/20150904/1026608875.html">India launches continuous monitoring of social media to combat ISIS</a></b> <b><a href="http://sputniknews.com/asia/20150904/1026608875.html"><br></a></b> <br>  The Government of India announced the launch of the ongoing <b>Situation Center for the Analysis of Social Media</b> in order to combat the growing influence on the minds of citizens of the Islamic State (ISIL).  The project will be carried out jointly by several power structures and includes analysis of information from social media to identify problem areas and prevent crime. <br><br>  In August, the National Anti-Terrorism Center was established in India, and within the framework of the Situation Center, 6 Indian ministries, including the Ministry of Internal Affairs and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, will closely interact. <br><br>  ISIS, a jihadist-minded terrorist organization, is known for attracting young people from all over the world to its ranks, including through social networks.  On the side of ISIS, between 20,000 and 30,000 foreigners are fighting against government forces in Syria and Iraq. <br>  ===== <br><br>  Since you are reading this material on a technical resource, then you definitely have an understanding of the new world order and you are responsible for the people around you. <br><br>  Take care of yourself and loved ones.  Any "Big Brother" will not solve our own problems, but can warn in time. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/294626/">https://habr.com/ru/post/294626/</a></p>
