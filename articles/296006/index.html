Often our initiatives are connected with something new and unknown for us.  We do not know how to take the first step, fearing the unknown and often the complete lack of knowledge in the area that we are discovering.  Whether learning foreign languages, starting your own business, playing sports, self-improvement or something else. <br><br>  In the articles of our <a href="http://megamozg.ru/company/smartprogress/">blog,</a> we have repeatedly mentioned that our service is actively developing a system of mentorship and offers many different training programs with a coach or mentor.  In their comments, users often expressed interest in the mechanisms of the service, so in today's article we will tell you about our mentoring courses, their structure, requirements and features. <br><a name="habracut"></a>

      Currently, business mentoring, coaching and various workshops designed to help achieve their goals are becoming a new trend - and for good reason.  Yes, now store shelves are full of a huge amount of literature aimed at illuminating a person‚Äôs path to his goals.  This option may seem quite suitable for pumping skills and pulling motivation.  But in any case, the book excludes the possibility of dialogue, while working with a mentor involves communicating not only with the teacher himself, but also with people who work with you. <br><br>  <b>So let's take a look at the benefits that trainings with mentors provide.</b> <b><br></b> <br><h4>  Tips </h4><br>  Mentors are people who are willing to share their own experiences and are happy to help others, and they should be consulted in areas of interest to you.  Indeed, friends and relatives are not always able to share valuable information and give really useful advice.  What could be better than the opinion of a professional? <br><br><h4>  A New Look </h4><br>  A mentor can describe such facets of issues and situations of interest to you, which you have not previously thought of, help to look at them from a different perspective and point out alternative solutions. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/1ab/ab4/4a1/1abab44a13fe4389800dac1f588198d9.jpg"><br><br><h4>  New knowledge </h4><br>  By participating in mentoring programs or working with an individual mentor, you can learn a lot.  And it will be exactly the knowledge that will help you on the battlefield.  As a rule, mentoring courses do not last long, so you will receive a concentrate of the most important information.  In addition to all that can be found in books and in the wide open spaces of the worldwide information network, mentors can share curious facts and their own experience, as well as useful life hacks that will facilitate your path to achieving your goals.  Mentors will tell you about the most effective methods and strategies to help in the implementation of your plans and solving problems that may stand in your way to your dream. <br><br><h4>  New people </h4><br>  Often, various training and group mentoring programs involve not only getting to know and working with a mentor, but also communicating with like-minded people, regardless of whether your course is online or you can meet them in person at seminars.  For many, meeting people who set themselves the same goals and make efforts to achieve them can be not only a useful experience, an opportunity to strengthen social ties in areas of interest to you, to share knowledge, but also to be the outlet that they have been looking for.  Communicating with people who have similar interests with you, you can find new friends and companions, and maybe business partners. <br><br><h4>  Social connections </h4><br>  As a rule, along with the vast experience and knowledge of a mentor, you can access some contacts from his address book.  We are all human, and communication in modern society (as always, in general) is everything.  Mentors can tell you which doors to knock on, who to turn to.  They can recommend you to potential partners or investors, tell you about the best trainers and teachers in their opinion, and much more.  The wider the network of your social connections, the more chances you have to solve certain problems or to realize certain undertakings, which means that the likelihood that you will succeed increases.  If you manage to establish yourself well in front of your mentor, then the possibility that he will further contribute to your development, and in the case of business mentoring, will be able to become your partner or investor is not excluded. <br><br><h4>  Confidence and encouragement </h4><br>  Often the road to the stars runs through the thorns, and our goals may seem to us unattainable.  We all face difficulties that sometimes make us think about giving up our hopes.  And therefore, we need motivation - so that we do not forget what we dreamed about when we began our path to the goal.  Nothing is more motivating than your own positive results and people.  And the energy of the group with which you are engaged, is able to charge you with optimism and faith in yourself.  After all, it is better not to fight troubles and overthrow obstacles alone, but in a team with an experienced fighter, who is a mentor and brothers in arms (people who dream of achieving the same thing as you).  It is likely that they will help you see the simple fact that your problems are a pattern with which many people meet.  A mentor will point out ways to solve them.  Step by step, moving towards your goal, you will feel that there is a person behind you with a lot of experience, that in a sense he will insure you, pointing out unpleasant moments and helping them get around. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/971/c3c/b27/971c3cb272974e8ea874e31890cf5140.jpg"><br><br><h4>  How Mentoring Programs Work on SmartProgress </h4><br>  In the role of mentors, we invite professional reputable coaches, business coaches and teachers.  The themes of the courses are very different - from learning foreign languages ‚Äã‚Äãand web development to methods for effectively achieving their goals and business training.  As part of the service, we provide both paid and free <a href="https://smartprogress.do/coaching/">programs</a> .  As a rule, each course is preceded by a webinar or a flash mob and a free introductory period, which will help you understand whether the training chosen earlier is suitable for you. <br><br>  All programs have a <a href="https://smartprogress.do/coaching/40/">description</a> compiled by the mentor himself, from which you can not only learn about the details and objectives of the course, but also understand who your teacher is and how much success he has achieved in the field of interest to you.  In the required fields it is prescribed for whom the program is intended and what it will give the participants. <br><br>  After payment, the user receives a notification inviting him to join a closed group.  Then he creates for himself a list of goals that he intends to achieve within the course.  During the passage of the program, each participant is obliged to keep a diary of goals, in which he must publish reports.  For non-compliance with this requirement, each teacher implies various "fines", as a rule, this drop out of the group. <br><br>  At first glance, such a policy may seem rather tough, but it is also a very effective tool for increasing motivation: the money for the course has been paid, and the person tries to keep up with the program so as not to lose hours of training because of his own laziness (no matter what form she will dress - chronic lack of time or fatigue).  The received reports are then reviewed by the mentor, he makes comments, gives his advice and recommendations. <br><br>  During the program, participants also receive homework assignments, meet like-minded people, participate in discussions and share experiences in the community.  A cohesive community of people with common goals is what we consider to be one of the main advantages of <a href="https://smartprogress.do/"><b>SmartProgress</b></a> .  It is likely that among them you will find business partners and brothers in spirit, and it is much easier to achieve goals together than alone. <br><br> <a href="https://smartprogress.do/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/009/879/e41/009879e418414194ae9363c8bf5298ee.jpg"></a> <br><br>  Come to us at the light and get acquainted with the programs offered by us, it is likely that some of them can change your life for the better and make you believe in yourself.  We are constantly developing a base of courses and mentors, so that in the near future we will be ready to boast of fresh content. <br><br><h4>  Afterword </h4><br>  That's all.  I sincerely hope that my article has helped you understand what mentoring is and what it is eaten with, and how this product is useful.  I would like to add that I had to work with a coach and participate in various trainings, and it was a wonderful experience.  Already after the first session with a mentor, I received such a charge of positive and self-confidence that I was ready to move mountains.  He helped me put everything on the shelves, look at some aspects of my business in a new way, pointed out to me those important nuances that I had not noticed before.  The most important thing is that together with him we managed to get to the bottom of what exactly my own business difficulties are and solve them - and, as a rule, this is not at all a lack of funding, but those devils and fears that have settled deep in us, and disguised as something else. <br><br>  If you can share your own classroom experience with mentors, coaches, business mentors and coaches, then please leave your comments - it will be interesting to hear your opinion. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/296006/">https://habr.com/ru/post/296006/</a></p>
