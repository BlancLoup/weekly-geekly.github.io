The consequences for the IT industry cannot be foreseen, although the IT market in Ukraine already has experience of the crisis of 2008‚Äì2009, when the industry held out, the tactics and tools used in such situations are already known.

      The growth sector is obliged to two main driving factors: the expansion of the general penetration of IT technologies in the business processes of companies and the daily life of people, the tendency to outsource the internal functions of IT and IT infrastructure to independent companies. <br><br>  At the moment, the IT market in Ukraine is growing and will continue to grow.  There are many technological changes in the world every day, and, accordingly, professionals are needed to support these changes.  In this regard, the demand for IT professionals will continue to be high. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  According to analysts, in 2012 the growth of the Ukrainian IT market will be 15-20%, which is an order of magnitude less than the 30% growth over the past year.  This is due to the second wave of the crisis in the Western market.  In general, the situation on the labor market in 2012 promises to be very prosperous for specialists in the IT sphere.  Experts explain the high demand by two factors.  First, the emergence of new technologies in IT, and secondly, the specialists of large companies often work not only on the domestic market, but also on the foreign one. <br><br><h5>  <b>Key points:</b> </h5><br><br><ol><li>  In 2011, the total number of vacancies in the IT industry increased by 2 times compared with the fourth quarter of 2010. </li><li>  According to employers' forecasts, growth trends in demand for IT professionals will continue in 2012. </li><li>  There is a tendency to grow professionals from young professionals within the company.  In 2011, the number of vacancies for entry-level specialists increased by 2.7 times, well ahead of the trends for programmers with extensive experience.  Experts predict a similar increase in 2012. </li><li>  80% of all vacancies for programmers and testers are posted by companies in the software development industry and, accordingly, only 20% are companies from other industries. </li><li>  One third of all vacancies posted by companies in the software industry are for .Net and Java programmers. </li><li>  The most active growth in demand in 2011 among software developers was observed for web-programmers.  The number of vacancies for them increased by 2.8 times. </li><li>  25% of software development jobs are for large companies with more than 500 employees.  In 2012, this figure, according to analysts, will grow, given the rather aggressive policy of recruiting these companies in the IT market. </li><li>  There is a shortage of Java and .Net programmers - less than one candidate for a place. </li><li>  The number of proposals for directors and heads of departments in the field of IT is increasing very actively.  In the fourth quarter of 2011, the number of vacancies increased by 3 times compared with the fourth quarter of 2010. </li><li>  The most active growth in the number of vacancies (by 3.7 times) was observed for specialists in business process automation systems (ERP, CRM, etc.).  Presumably in 2012, the demand for specialists of this profile will only continue to grow: the process of introducing automation systems is only gaining momentum. </li><li>  The growth of salaries of software developers in 2011 amounted to an average of 15-20%. </li></ol><br><br><h5>  REVIEW OF EARNINGS OF SOFTWARE DEVELOPERS </h5><br><br>  In the world every day there are many technological changes, and, accordingly, we need specialists to support these changes.  In this regard, the demand for IT professionals will continue to be high, which means that the main trends in pay will also remain unchanged.  The projected wage inflation in Ukraine will remain at the same level, and the task of the large IT companies in Ukraine is to make every effort to keep it. <br><br>  In 2011, the dynamics of salary expectations of Ukrainian programmers corresponded to the traditional behavior of the labor market, when a gradual increase in salary expectations alternated with periods of ‚Äúsleep‚Äù in the winter holiday (end of December - beginning of January) period and summer ‚Äúvacation period‚Äù.  After the summer lull, when salary expectations did not change significantly, in the third quarter of 2011 they grew strongly - by an average of 15-20%. <br><br>  Significant changes in the context of Java technology have affected the salaries of senior-level specialists.  Their growth in the second half of 2011 was on average at 15%.  Salaries of specialists of other levels fluctuated either upwards or downwards within 5-10% (Fig. 11). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/13d/daa/0b4/13ddaa0b41d1be5937cd12e1684c797e.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  It is worth noting the significant average annual changes in the cost of specialists working with .Net and C ++ technologies at the level of Middle and Junior (Fig. 12, 13).  Within the year, wage fluctuations were quite significant, thereby confirming the market trends.  Their average growth was in the range of 15-25%. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/f8d/8c4/ddd/f8d8c4ddd72fa65413349ff17b366f1c.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/b36/1ff/267/b361ff2679684e4327612e12ec193678.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Salaries of testing managers (20%) also increase, with their subordinates, testers, an increase of 10 to 15% depending on work experience.  The salary of this specialist depends on the complexity of the project and the level of responsibility.  In this regard, the cash reward can be very different. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/923/a0f/20f/923a0f20f034c31fc9f4be72c757abe1.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Salary expectations continue to grow due to the fact that the market does not stand still, competition between companies is growing and, accordingly, the competitive struggle of IT companies for candidates is getting tougher.  Highly qualified specialists are in short supply, companies are warming up the market by willingness to pay more for the sake of hiring ‚Äústars‚Äù. <br><br>  There is also a clear tendency to retain specialists; many companies are ready to bring the key employee‚Äôs salary in line with the average salary expectations in the labor market, which tend to be higher than the average for the company. <br><br>  Specialists with little experience, but good education, who have recently completed university studies, are no longer prepared to easily lower expectations in the interview process, since they have access to a variety of internship programs, following the results of which they can qualify for professional positions payment <br><br>  The labor market of IT specialists in Ukraine is ‚Äúoverheated‚Äù, and many candidates, on the one hand, unreasonably overestimate salary expectations, on the other hand, companies in the race for highly qualified programmers support this trend. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/ee2/260/6d9/ee22606d917949b7ce64e3edfac1b948.jpg" align="left">  <a href="http://www.luxoft-personnel.ru/about/management/bogdashkina.html">Zoya Bogdashkina</a> , head of Luxoft Personnel's recruitment department, comments on: <br>  <i>‚ÄúAt the moment, there is a growing demand from companies for professionals who specialize in developing software for mobile and web applications.</i>  <i>In this regard, experts who are engaged in the development of the most popular platforms such as Android, iOs or PHP, Python, Ruby, Flash, demonstrate the highest growth in wages.</i>  <i>Traditionally, developers who write in Java and .Net continue to be in demand.</i>  <i>This year and next, the salaries of highly qualified IT specialists will increase, the market overheating will continue.</i>  <i>I also note the following situation now: in the past, the capacity of Ukraine‚Äôs candidate market allowed only Ukrainians from the capital and regions to be considered.</i>  <i>Now, due to the high demand of many IT professionals, some companies are ready to transport potential employees from other countries.</i>  <i>Previously, this was not typical for Ukraine. ‚Äù</i> <br><br><h5>  BRIGHT TRENDS 2012 </h5><br><br>  <b>Dynamics of the number of vacancies in the field of information technology for 6 quarters (01.10.2010 - 31.03.2012)</b> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/811/26b/8b9/81126b8b977b1ab2f15cd92771f11a09.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  According to the portal it.rabota.ua, the growth rate of the number of vacancies in the IT sphere practically repeated the trends in the labor market as a whole.  In the first quarter of 2012, the total number of vacancies in this area increased by 2 times compared with the fourth quarter of 2010. <br><br>  <b>Dynamics of the number of vacancies for software developers for 6 quarters (01.10.2010 - 31.03.2012)</b> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/ca4/635/561/ca46355615443994c85811fdd1e8467d.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Once again, we are convinced that web programming technologies are developing by leaps and bounds, only in the first quarter of this year, the number of web programming vacancies increased by 6% compared to the 4th quarter of 2011, and compared to 2010, the increase was almost 3 times. <br><br>  <b>Dynamics of the number of vacancies for IT directors (CTO / CIO) / Heads of IT departments for 6 quarters (10/01/2010 - 03/31/2012)</b> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/e6f/2e3/831/e6f2e38313533b8acfe4f4c0965c3dae.jpg" alt="image"><br>  The number of proposals for directors and heads of departments in the field of information technology is increasing very actively, significantly ahead of the trends of the entire IT sphere.  In the 1st quarter of 2012, the number of vacancies increased by 3.2 times compared to the 4th quarter of 2010. <br><br>  <b>Dynamics of the number of vacancies for specialists in automation systems for 6 quarters (10/01/2010 - 03/31/2012)</b> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/cf0/13d/d89/cf013dd89ecb0542356931bd097e957b.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  In the 1st quarter of 2012, the number of vacancies offered by employers to specialists in automation systems increased 3.9 times compared to the 4th quarter of 2010, which once again confirms the need to introduce automated enterprise systems and this is the first step towards building long-term relationships with customers. <br><br>  <i>The full version of the study for 2011 can be downloaded <a href="http://www.luxoft-personnel.ru/press/research/ukraine_2011/"><b>here</b></a> .</i> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/146446/">https://habr.com/ru/post/146446/</a></p>
