  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Education in IT, the growing importance of self-education and specialist self-esteem</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Dear Habrasoobschestvo.  I decided to raise the question - how do you monitor your vocational education? <br>  This fall, I lectured to future PR people at a commercial university.  On the one hand, all is good, the people paid for education, everyone is aware, they listen attentively, take notes, ask.  On the other hand, with each lecture, you become increasingly aware that this is not enough.  That no matter how you laid out, for a normal level you need not a course of lectures for one semester, not 50-60 hours, but much more.  Yes, these guys will have an undoubted advantage in the market, but still, a lot will have to be learned independently.  Unless, of course, they do not think they are cool specialists - and more often than not, that‚Äôs what happens. <br>  Although those who themselves are engaged in their education and all comprehend already in the course of practice, are subject to star disease, not less.  I purchased links to sape, showed a report with increased attendance - and already an optimizer.  I pushed through the media plan, bought banners, created a dozen ads in Yandex.Direct - this is already a real full-fledged Internet marketer.  :) <a name="habracut"></a><br>  A year ago, an acquaintance who was quite respected by me in the field of SEO raised a topic in the spirit of ‚ÄúHow to evaluate your level as a specialist‚Äù on the largest optimization forum.  Several freshly baked ‚Äúgurus‚Äù were advised to try to bring a couple of high-frequency queries to the top ... And so on in everything.  How many times did you have to work with a designer, who seems to be recommended by many, but in reality it turns out that in principle he does not know any other solutions except how to stick a piece of clip art instead of a cap.  Or stumble upon articles of eminent moneymakers (it sounds like fun already) about how to earn a thousand from a blog.  And how many proposals for the development of sites of any complexity from the "experts", nothing more serious topics for WordPress did not do.  And the problem is not that there are many beginners around, the problem is that often they either do not see the need to learn, or do not have the opportunity. <br>  As in any rapidly developing environment, to develop a program, draw up and approve an educational course in such a way that the information is relevant - it is unrealistic.  Especially in public universities.  With this, you can hardly do anything. <br>  I can say for myself - the traditional marketing course is 90% made up of beautiful phrases, they have nothing to do with actual practice.  True, there is still a whole bunch of different courses of LITTLE marketing, the whole difference between them lies only in the examples being considered, in the price and titles of teachers.  But, again, after they finish, you do not become a specialist at all.  Yes, and attend a bunch of various courses and trainings - will result in a lot of money, and it is not known whether the expected result will result. <br>  Moreover, the lack of educational programs creates another problem - the lack of a unified system of knowledge assessment.  On the one hand, we have not yet moved away from the obligatory presentation of a diploma and work record books, on the other hand, requests for recommendations from previous employers / clients are already in fashion.  This is from the employer.  But it is not only a matter of crusts; in this case, the issue of self-esteem is more important for me - and here everything is much more complicated.  There are no intelligible guidelines, only new, more complex projects are the impetus for development.  If such come across.  And if the new step is not so much higher than the conquered, in order to entail failure. <br>  Over time, you begin to realize that the value at which you manage to sell yourself is not yet an indicator of professionalism.  This is an indicator of promotion, workload, demand - not non-professionalism.  Even later, you realize that the reputation established in society is not always an indicator either. <br>  And then you think about how to assess your knowledge and skills, as far as you are really cool as a specialist. <br>  It would be nice to suggest here a method for settling it with beautiful self-digging.  Only I do not know this technique.  :( <br>  In this connection, the question is - how do you decide for yourself the question of professional self-assessment? </div>
