So, in MAI, the focus will be on augmented reality technology and AI, in RUDN will focus on <a href="https://blogs.microsoft.com/iot/2018/09/24/announcing-azure-digital-twins-create-digital-replicas-of-spaces-and-infrastructure-using-cloud-ai-and-iot/">digital twin</a> technologies, cognitive services, such as computer vision and speech recognition for robots.  In MGPU, several disciplines are launched at once, including ‚ÄúNeural network technologies in business‚Äù based on Microsoft Cognitive Services, ‚ÄúDevelopment of Internet applications‚Äù on Microsoft Azure Web Apps, etc. The Higher School of Economics and the Yakutsk <a href="https://www.s-vfu.ru/">NEFU</a> have chosen the priority direction of training a new generation of teachers areas of cloud computing and artificial intelligence.
