The point is not that I have nothing to write about, but the fact that after spending a year at the Habr√© I have accumulated a lot of impressions.  I learned a lot, found, invented thanks to Habra and his community.  But there are things that just bother me.  This post is about what is habr for me. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h4>  Honey </h4><br>  I wanted to get on Habr since I found out about the site.  Moreover, I did not want to buy or beg someone for an invite.  I wanted to write a post about what is really interesting.  Deserve the right to be part of the site.  So I wrote about Openbravo POS and got the privilege, which I considered something good.  It‚Äôs a pity, I have few topics that I understand well, I don‚Äôt have the talent to write nicely and to the point.  In addition, many ideas are harvested in the head and remain either in their projects, or are thrown away somewhere in the trash, as defective. <br>  So, what are the advantages of Habra?  The main thing is that it is interesting to read.  Read what you want, take part in discussions, advise, learn.  Habr has a good authority on the Internet, so written posts can be read not only here, but also on other popular sites where the post is then copied (moreover, I often see below the link to Habr or to the person who wrote it, which is just wonderful).  The fact that administrators have created more than just a site, rather, an organism that itself can grow and develop. <br>  But I will stop at this to pay attention to the shortcomings.

    <h4>  Tar </h4><br><h5>  Karma </h5><br>  I always liked the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãkarma.  Karma controls users within society.  But often users do not understand the rights.  I understand that everyone can give out all the benefits to karma or minus, but sometimes users are minus for nothing. <br>  <i>Example:</i> I wrote a comment that collected more than 50 pluses.  Karma has not increased, but decreased.  What is the reason?  Especially those who disagree with the opinion understand that a minus per statement will not give anything, and it is better to think of karma.  Thus, the rating quickly falls from seemingly innocuous words.  The rest do not see, and the author gets cuffs. <br><br><h5>  Rating </h5><br>  The rating is not only considered incomprehensible as (there is no transparent system, at least I did not find it), it still jumps in different directions depending on the karma.  There still seems to be a correction in activity, but somehow everything is strange. <br>  In any case, I rarely look at him both in myself and in others, so I will not swear much. <br><br><h5>  Hubs </h5><br>  With innovations I got confused, I had to subscribe and re-sign somewhere.  I still do not remember what has changed in contrast to what it was, but I remembered well what gestures I had to do. <br><br><h5>  Drafts </h5><br>  I can not remove any drafts and I do not know what to do with them.  Maybe somewhere there is a secret entrance to Narnia, where a small intimidated delete tip is hidden behind a stone, but I do not have the perfect vision to find it. <br><br>  It is interesting, but I‚Äôm finishing up with the cons, because I don‚Äôt like Habr more for not having too much to satisfy me. <br><br><h4>  When there is everything, you need something else </h4><br><h5>  What am i missing </h5><br>  I do not have enough space, some comments simply do not leave, because <b>it does not correspond to the opinion of the majority</b> , which means it is not normal.  I understand that all people have always wanted to break and rule dissenters in order to drag him into their circle, but something needs to be done about it. <br><br>  I do not have enough time line in which I could follow how a man behaved in Habr√©.  Now I‚Äôll explain everything on my fingers: a person wrote a good post (or even not one good one), but his karma is clearly underestimated.  And it is impossible to understand why.  I would like to see how karma has changed at one time or another.  Ideally, also display published posts and comments.  After all, karma staggers through the actions of the user.  In this way, it will be possible to quickly find good posts in a person, look at his history and draw normal conclusions. <br><br>  I do not have enough votes, I can not give two pluses in karma to a person.  Six months ago, I raised the karma to something.  Today he wrote a great post, for which I would like to give him another plus, but no longer.  And I already forget what exactly and when I voted.  Keep notes?  Well, sorry, not accustomed. <br><br>  I miss normal words!  Habrludi, habrtopiki, habrsobschestvo, habrbukvy, habrstrana, habrchtoto.  All this is in the rights of the creators, I am not too negative to this, but sometimes annoying. <br><br>  I lack the normal ability to report an error in a word or phrase to the author.  It is necessary to write a sentence, select the right place, indicate which particular topic it belongs to.  He, in turn, must open the post, edit it, look for a place with an error and, just now, rule.  Hasn't anyone thought about it for so many years? <br><br>  I do not have enough settings.  Seriously.  I almost always read especially zaminusovannye comments.  When in one hand tea, in the other butter, you twist the page with one foot, distill the cat from the other butter, and read the comment is problematic, without pointing at it.  Everything could be fixed with just one item in the settings.  It went from Linux, I guess.  Now I want more and more optional and customized for each. <br><br><h4>  Instead of leaving in English </h4><br>  Am I afraid of losing karma?  No longer, I used to value her like the eye of the eye, now I don‚Äôt care, the main thing is to be in the black.  And if not, in order to write a good post, I can always send it to the sandbox. <br><br>  Why I just will not leave from a habr?  Because I like it here and I would like to get better. <br><br>  Why did I write this post, but did not shut up in a rag, did not send recommendations to the support mail?  Because these are my thoughts, my arguments, and it is not forbidden to write them.  Besides, I know that there are more sensible and clever people in Habr√© than me, who can correctly supplement or adequately criticize me. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/147376/">https://habr.com/ru/post/147376/</a></p>
