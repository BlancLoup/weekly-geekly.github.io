In fact, how to call this text?  In her head, as always, a herd of thoughts interrupting each other.  I have something to tell, but there is no single vector that would declare a clear path to the story. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/71b/701/5fc/71b7015fc54b9de485815a03ff9796e9.png" alt="image"><br><br>  One vector about the founder romance, who blindly believes in his idea.  Second, how startups are created and what is needed for that.  The third is about the conclusions.  Conclusions that we can not critically evaluate what we love.  Three vectors and simultaneously three themes intersecting in one post.  Remember, like Jobs, "... just three stories, nothing more." <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <i><b>So, I have my own startup.</b></i>  No, not the usual, like booking a place in a restaurant, a social network of animal lovers or an instagram killer.  Of course he is Unique!  He is the best!  This idea is definitely a billion bucks, otherwise.  Why?  I have one weighty argument that breaks competitors into pieces - because I love him!  blind unrestrained love.  Nothing else exists around him.

      The goal is visible, users are already visible on the horizon, they are piling on our site in thousands.  After all, we give everything for free. <br>  These imaginary people, of course, cannot live without us.  We will really solve their problem, and in our opinion a fairly global problem.  Then we will turn over half a century about software development, and that‚Äôs it, life has gone right.  Maldives, girls, cars.  <i>... Stop.</i>  Something is not right here, experience suggests that there will be difficulties, but from where?  Here is the starting capital.  Here is the command.  Here are 10 years of development experience, but I can control everything!  As it turned out, not everything is so smooth.  Let's go back a little bit again. <br><br>  <i><b>So, I have my own startup.</b></i>  Unique, serious, which denotes a real problem and its solution.  A monetization scheme, outlined by the ears, is outlined.  There is an attempt to understand the phrase "business model".  It seems even found competitors, googled similar topics for keywords.  In general, all of Feng Shui.  It's time to say: - "Hey, investor, give me more money!".  And he does not give.  The market is small to him, there is no demand, and indeed he is very busy.  You can not designate everything just for him, kindly break off. <br><br>  Well, okay, you still can not give up, you need to try and try again.  Try, try, try. <br>  Unrestrained love for your child will not allow you to fall asleep before midnight, and wake up later than five in the morning.  Yes, it is difficult, and sometimes it is not clear where this all will lead.  But you get up and do it. <br>  Something, even small steps, but you do, because there is no way back.  You can turn around to 180 * and see there a dumb uncle whose ideas you will implement in place of your own.  Therefore, we continue to do and come what may.  After all, we will hire more people, add with them even more features, and then you look and start the prototype.  And in general we can handle it, we don‚Äôt need handouts. <br><br>  <i><b>So, I have my own startup and a great team.</b></i>  We are still unique, we have no analogues and competitors.  Those that were, no longer counted.  They are fuckers.  Of course, otherwise, because we have such a scale and the most trendy things.  Clouds, mobile devices, backlog on sociality.  Let it be while in the embryonic form, who needs to understand that!  First of all, a large software corporation drew attention to us and gave support.  Though the money is running out, that's okay!  Blind faith has never let anyone down.  Sooner, even without late, the green papers will find me, why worry.  The notorious Russian maybe - a terrible force.  With this word, we won the war, built cities and roads, created communism. <br><br><h4>  At this point, the vector of the story should be changed, from the romantic romance to common sense. </h4><br>  <i><b>So, how are startups created?</b></i>  My subjective opinion, which is quite simple, for those who are in the subject.  There is a problem, and there is a solution.  Under the problem, our brother usually understands something unpleasant, terrible, which is best avoided by all means.  In fact, it is not.  The problem is a hint to you how to make the world a better place. <br><br>  Was it once a problem sfotkat, impose a filter and put in social.  your cat's net?  Was it a problem to tell the whole world what you were doing in 140 characters?  Yes, however, and the search for information has never been a problem, the libraries are a thousand years old.  And the horse carriages, by the way, no less, the car did not solve the problem - it made the world better. <br><br>  However, this is from the point of view of the consummer.  On the other side of the coin is an innovator.  Here it breaks everything from the inside, literally does not give sleep the current state of affairs.  The more breaks, the higher the desire to change everything.  He then finds the strength to go against the system, get cuffs from it, fall a hundred times and rise to eventually crush the system for themselves, make the world a better place, and write his name in the story. <br><br>  <i><b>So how are startups created?</b></i>  If the problem is vital for the innovator, he begins to look for ways to solve it. <br>  The problem exists only for him, she does not allow him to live.  For everyone else, the world is what it is, only the problems are different.  It turns out each person is an innovator, with ways to solve their problems.  So the ways to find a solution are inscrutable.  Have you ever jumped from a parachute, dear habravchanin?  Or ROUP-DZHAMPING from a cliff?  And jump into the abyss?  Finding solutions for startups and there is a leap into the abyss.  You do not know where you will land and where you fly, how to maneuver and who to take with you. <br><br>  Yes, another very important point is that several more innovators jumped with you, with the same idea.  They also fly parallel to you, someone higher, someone lower.  You are united by one thing - this is the place on the precipice where you saw the idea flying past and jumped along with it.  By all laws, only the one whose flight will be straighter will land faster.  Well, or behind the turbocharged engine will help. <br><br>  <i><b>So how are startups created ?!</b></i>  Carrying out innovation to the public, you need to remember one thing - they do not need innovation.  People lived beautifully without her, and will live on.  All that they can give you is a couple of clicks. <br>  Maybe a few words, and if you are lucky, you will remember your e-mail address for spam and give it to you.  Then go back to your business. <br>  The point is that this moment, between clicks and getting profit from your website or program - is key.  It determines how long the user is delayed, how much then imbued with the idea.  I think these truths have already been written by Paul Graham, Robert Kiyosaki, and others that I have not read. <br>  In fairness it should be said that the motive of the person who came to your site is different.  But in 95% this is a simple curiosity, which he wants to satisfy in the simplest way. <br><br><h5>  It remains for me to tell why I am writing this post again changing the thought vector. </h5><br><br>  New Year is coming, and this is the time when you look around the whole past and try to look into the future. <br>  Finally, you understand what you did wrong and why it all happened that way.  There are no tones of pity or sadness, everything must be taken as it is and move on to the very bright idea that I once saw standing on a cliff. <br>  To those who have not yet jumped into the abyss, I would like to wish good luck and give some advice. <br><br>  <i><b>Be sure to try against all odds.</b></i>  The more cones you fill, the more experience you will have.  Do you have a mentor?  Then fine, this advice, and all the following you do not need.  And the majority, I think, it is not. <br>  If you give up, you need to rest, get distracted.  This means that you are doing something wrong, and you need to look at the solution from a different angle.  The main thing is not to beat your head against the wall, otherwise it will break. <br>  <i><b>Look for the simplest solutions.</b></i>  Do not need bicycles.  The easier your decision will be, the more users will understand it.  The same applies to the implementation.  Look for ready-made components. <br>  <i><b>Do not spray.</b></i>  You need to be able to focus on one idea and polish it to perfection.  Losing focus, we lose the desire for the ideal. <br>  <i><b>Communicate and tell about your ideas.</b></i>  Constant networking, the more people learn about you and your idea, the more feedback you will receive, and the better the implementation will be. <br><br>  Perhaps these are the most important things that I realized during the 4 months of my startup life. <br>  And yes, all the fails that happened during this time allowed to write this text. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/296986/">https://habr.com/ru/post/296986/</a></p>
