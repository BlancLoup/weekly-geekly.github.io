  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Social Games: Search for love in Mamba and LovePlanet</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Less than a month ago, with a difference of only two weeks, two of the largest and most famous dating sites in Runet, <a href="http://www.mamba.ru/">Mamba</a> and <a href="http://www.loveplanet.ru/">LovePlanet,</a> launched a new gaming service: games and applications that have social functions. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/870/27e/d90/87027ed90e7b7add665f1eaae2880769.png"><br>  The <a href="http://www.nextgame.ru/">NextGame.RU</a> project represents the interests of game developers on both portals and is ready to share first impressions and results of our work with dating services. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h3>  First look </h3><br>  Mamba and LovePlanet went different ways when implementing a new service. <br><br>  First, Mamba developed its own gaming platform with its API, and LovePlanet used NextGame.RU as an integrator for the entire service. 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>
        <script>
          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      Secondly, Mamba has imposed stringent requirements for applications: game mechanics should facilitate user acquaintance, and LovePlanet opens the door to any applications, if they have: dating functions, traffic generators, good monetization. <br><br>  Thirdly, Mamba launched the service at once through all its partner sites, LovePlanet - so far only on the main, ‚Äúparent‚Äù site.  Recall that both the portal have a very extensive affiliate program. <br><br><h3>  Pulse of love </h3><br>  We published the application <a href="http://www.nextgame.ru/apps/166">‚ÄúBottle - find your love</a> ‚Äù on both portals and received the following data: <br><table><tbody><tr><td>  <b>Parameter</b> </td><td>  <b>Mamba</b> </td><td>  <b>Loveplanet</b> </td></tr><tr><td>  Number of installations </td><td>  31,408 </td><td>  20,413 </td></tr><tr><td>  DAU average </td><td>  4,500 </td><td>  3,800 </td></tr><tr><td>  ARPPU </td><td>  186 rub. </td><td>  206 rub. </td></tr><tr><td>  Loyalty </td><td>  25% </td><td>  22% </td></tr></tbody></table><br>  The popularity of the application and there, and there is very high.  The number of installations is roughly comparable, taking into account that the ‚ÄúBottle‚Äù was launched earlier on Mamba.  And, despite the fact that the ‚ÄúBottle‚Äù has lost in the rating ‚ÄúFast-Growing Applications‚Äù, it still remains in the top of the most popular applications of Mamba.  As part of the LovePlanet "Bottle" - the most popular application. <br><br>  ARPPU (i.e., the average check of those users who paid) is also comparable.  Interestingly, this indicator for ‚ÄúBottle‚Äù is significantly higher than the average ARPPU on Mamba among all applications - there are only 72 rubles (data provided by Mamba), and very close to the average indicator of NextGame.RU platform as a whole - 160 rubles. <br><br><h3>  To give your heart </h3><br>  The first question from the developer is how easy is it to connect to a new gaming platform? <br>  API Mamba sharpened by the integration of applications for dating.  Here and use of standard search in the user base, and the publication of messages from applications in the personal diary of the user.  But in order to get through to Mamba, the developer will have to sweat, changing his gameplay in accordance with the requirements of the portal. <br><br>  The NextGame.RU API, through which the developer connects to LovePlanet, does not yet have the ability to search by users and send messages to the user's diary (let's make a reservation right away: the ‚Äúpost to wall‚Äù function in NextGame.RU platform is available, it is not implemented for LovePlanet) .  However, the NextGame.RU API is constantly being developed and is gaining new features, so the festival will soon be on the ‚ÄúPlanet of Love‚Äù.  LovePlanet is set up to experiment with different types of games and applications.  The bonus for the developer is that his game will be published not only on the LovePlanet portal, but also on 900 other web sites that are connected to the NextGame.RU platform. <br><br><h3>  The second question from the developer is how much will they pay me? </h3><br>  Mamba conditions - 90% to the developer.  Terms LovePlanet - 45%.  All deductions after commissions payment systems.  Already licked?  But everything is not so simple and ‚Äútasty‚Äù as it seems at first glance. <br>  There is a significant difference in the calculation of contributions to the developer.  In Mamba, the scheme is built as follows: first, a percentage is paid to the site where the transaction took place, and the remaining amount is given to the developer.  In this case, at the time of payment, it will not be clear how much will be actually transferred to the developer‚Äôs side - the scheme does not yet look transparent.  According to our data, deductions in reality range from 30% to 90% of the money that the user brought. <br><br>  By the way, from February 1, 2012, Mamba promises to change the system of contributions to the developer and make it more transparent and understandable.  According to Mamba, deductions should grow by 30-40%. <br><br>  LovePlanet gave all the calculations to the developers at the mercy of NextGame.RU, so the developer always receives the standard 45% of each user transaction, regardless of where this transaction was made. <br><br>  I hope that in the near future we will be able to provide a more complete comparative description of other applications, as well as new dating sites, which will be published in January. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/135067/">https://habr.com/ru/post/135067/</a></p>
