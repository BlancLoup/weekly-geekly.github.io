In this regard, nothing can replace your own experience.  But the general mood of the audience can be understood with their help.  Linkedin's professional social network has <a href="https://lists.linkedin.com/2016/top-attractors/en/us">published a</a> list of 40 of the most attractive companies in terms of American job search.  Those that take away the most talented graduates and specialists in the labor market. <br><br>  It is clear that very few people can compete with Google, Facebook and Apple.  The edition of Business Insider decided to <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/top-wall-street-firms-to-work-for-2016-6">choose</a> from this list the most popular Wall Street firms.  The rating is based on the activities of more than 433 million social network users.  These include job status, attempts to view company pages and attempts to contact them, as well as the duration of the hiring process. <a name="habracut"></a>

      Before proceeding to the list itself, a couple of conclusions.  According <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/harvard-mbas-dont-want-to-go-into-banking-anymore-2015-8">to</a> BI, the investment departments of banks have become less popular with graduates of the most reputable US business schools.  Only one of 46 students at top universities is interested in working at a bank.  Many today prefer technical startups or start a career in the family business. <br><br>  In our blog, we <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/itinvest/blog/304248/">recently wrote</a> about the difference between working in banks and working in hedge funds, based on analysts' feedback from Quora.  It turned out that the work in the investment fund is more interesting and less affected by the corporate bureaucracy, employees get more freedom.  But, both of them are forced today to look for new ways to attract young talents, change their strategies and adapt themselves to competitors in this battle. <br><br>  Next is the list of the best employers on Wall Street.  It has only 4 positions.  And we will start with the last one. <br><br><h4>  4. Morgan Stanley </h4><br>  <b>What is this</b> ?  A bank that offers consumer services and conducts aggressive expansion in the field of investment management (asset portfolio is $ 2 trillion), while its own earnings from stock trading are declining. <br><br>  Last November, CEO James Gorman announced that the bank would build a new management team to cope with the upcoming financial crisis.  In particular, he mentioned a new long-term strategy for hiring the best workers and their further adaptation.  In other words, today the bank wants to hire employees, assessing their potential for 10 years ahead.  Considering which of them would be able to get a management position by the end of the crediting period. <br><br>  <b>Benefits</b>  In comparison with other banks is not too strict dress code.  Employees are allowed to dress comfortably.  There is a high level of culture of communication and workers communications.  If you become a vice president, you can count on 4-week paid vacation. <br><br>  <u>Total ranking position</u> : 40. <br><br><h4>  3. Goldman Sachs </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/fc4/e66/174/fc4e66174a48490f82d13599f4d556f7.png"><br><br>  <b>What is this</b> ?  The dream of all investment bankers of the old school.  Today, the bank looks very attractive for computer geniuses, programmers and engineers.  In the bank itself, for some time now they prefer to call themselves ‚Äútechnology company‚Äù. <br><br>  The bank has changed its recruitment strategy (goodbye, confused test puzzles).  Young employees now received something like a mentoring system with regular feedback on the job.  Bank passed rejuvenation of personnel.  The company began to hire even younger employees than before.  Especially on positions related to technology or operating activities. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ec2/3cd/c77/ec23cdc779d0469bbb61c9ae5327c73f.png"><br><br>  <i>Goldman Sachs analyst at work.</i>  <i>Photo: <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/">Business Insider</a></i> <br><br>  <b>Benefits</b>  Beginners can count on cheap corporate dining, a gym with an attractive system of discounts, clean and comfortable jobs. <br><br>  <u>Total ranking position</u> : 27. <br><br><h4>  2. Deloitte </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e55/0c7/0f6/e550c70f6c414520883559c67d4048de.png"><br><br>  <b>What is this</b> ?  Audit giant headquartered in New York.  He is engaged in consulting, accounting services and tax support.  Currently the company has 225 thousand employees.  Deloitte receives up to 1.9 million job applications annually.  Technical services of the company attract highly qualified scientists, technologists, engineers and mathematicians.  At the company itself, the results of the Linkedin rating commented as follows: ‚ÄúOur employees solve really interesting problems.‚Äù <br><br>  <b>Benefits</b>  Compensate for training costs.  The company has sabbatikalnye programs.  That is, you can get up to 6 months of release from work in order to improve your professional level.  Not to mention the other standard corporate chips. <br><br>  <u>Total ranking place</u> : 24. <br><br><h4>  1. BlackRock </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f65/2ee/094/f652ee0944064bf19b8561c9a29b7d4a.jpg"><br><br>  <b>What is this</b> ?  An investment management company from New York.  As of March 2016, she managed assets of $ 4.7 trillion.  BlackRock employs over 12,000 people, 47% of them work outside the United States.  In addition to the actual financiers with indicators of 130+, about 1,300 economists, quanta and engineers work here. <br><br>  <b>Benefits</b>  The company plans to expand its staff and update its recruitment strategy (where without it).  The system of exchange of ideas here is at a high level.  For example, a two-day innovative summit allows you to bring your ideas directly to senior administrators. <br><br>  <u>Total ranking position</u> : 19. <br><br><h4>  Articles and links from <a href="http://www.itinvest.ru/services/">ITinvest</a> on the topic: </h4><br><ul><li>  IT-vacancies from ITinvest ( <a href="http://www.itinvest.ru/about/vacancies/admin-matrix/">Matrix trading system</a> <a href="http://www.itinvest.ru/about/vacancies/admin-qort/">administrator, QORT administrator</a> , <a href="http://www.itinvest.ru/about/vacancies/main-programmer/">lead programmer</a> ); </li><li>  <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/itinvest/blog/267899/">Online Trading: How to become a developer of systems for trading on the exchange</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/itinvest/blog/278931/">What a programmer should be able to get a job in finance</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/itinvest/blog/270956/">How to recognize a person's emotions in his face: A test for employees of financial companies</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/itinvest/blog/274362/">The conditions under which the financiers work: A tour of the offices of Goldman Sachs and Bloomberg</a> </li></ul></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/395937/">https://habr.com/ru/post/395937/</a></p>
