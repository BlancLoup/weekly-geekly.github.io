  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Foreign Language Learning System</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  This post is more likely for those who studied a foreign language at school, forgot everything, but there is a great desire (need) to know the language, but there is very little time to learn.  I realized that the most effective way to learn a language in the realities of today's life (when I spent the whole day at the office or institute, and in the evening I don‚Äôt want anything) is an independent system for learning English.  after reading a lot of things on the net about this and thinking, I got the following (I consider learning English as an example). <br><br>  the system is divided into several zones, which merge to form knowledge of the language: <br><br>  1. grammar <br>  2. understanding of writing <br>  3. listening comprehension <br>  4. to understand you 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>
        <script>
          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      Now in more detail on the tools that can be used inside the zones: <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  1. grammar <br>  - " <a href="http://www.ozon.ru/context/detail/id/1923355/">Blue Murphy</a> ", a very useful thing, does not show you all sorts of charts and tables there, but shows real situations.  There are examples and exercises right away.  2-3 exercises per week take a total of 20-30 minutes each.  Not a word in Russian, but everything is clear. <br><br>  2. understanding of writing <br>  - reading news on topics of interest to you in a foreign language.  Well, everything is clear, and the easiest way is via RSS.  you can spend on it 10-15 minutes a day, without reference to any particular time. <br>  - reading books with parallel translation.  (left in English, right in Russian. sold in any book) <br><br>  3. listening comprehension <br>  - podcasts on topics of interest to you in a foreign language.  as an example for the English language - <a href="http://twit.tv/twit">TWiT</a> <br>  - films in the original with subtitles and subsequently without.  In this case, I am interested in series, because for the most part there is a ‚Äúsimple language‚Äù.  and, of course, films and podcasts are properly received through a subscription. <br>  - on movies and podcasts you will have 2-4 hours a week.  Moreover, it is convenient to listen to podcasts in a traffic jam or in the subway. <br>  - Audio books - the same, and also in traffic jams and in the subway. <br><br>  4. to understand you <br>  - for this you need to have at least some minimal vocabulary, understanding how applications are built and of course a little courage (all but courage will be given points 1-3).  there are two directions: write and speak.  in order to write you need less courage, but in order to speak you need not only courage, but also the interlocutor, and here comes skype with its communities and indeed any English-speaking subject (preferably native).  You can talk about any nonsense, the most important thing to say. <br><br>  there are also tools that combine several zones at once.  I came across a wonderful portal for learning the language with the name <a href="http://livemocha.com/">livemocha.com</a> that was <a href="http://livemocha.com/">completely inappropriate</a> for the Russian ear, but if you close your eyes to the name, you can see the following: free of charge, many different levels of courses, different tasks (learning, reading, listening, making sentences, writing voices, communication).  it is enough to do one set of exercises per week (it takes 30 minutes). <br><br>  When I received a reply to my Google letter on a question related to Google App, I understood what it was about, I fixed the problem, I understood that the system works. <br><br>  and what tools do you use, dear habraklyudi?  I would appreciate comments. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/21102/">https://habr.com/ru/post/21102/</a></p>
