      I think we need to stop this game.  Finish off to those who are more busy, who are in a hurry.  I think that we need to relax, learn to enjoy this world, this life, and not try to become more productive by watching this life just pass by. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  Why being busy is a trap for fools </h4><br>  If you are busy, it will never end.  You can not get rid of the constant flow of work, because the task lists never end.  Emails come constantly.  People call, everyone needs something.  Meetings never stop.  We are like squirrels in a wheel, aimlessly running, just to please the boss, or earn someone money. <br><br>  The squirrel in the wheel will always run.  Always - because she has no goal. <br><br>  And you know what?  Travel has a goal.  And we are already at the end point.  After all, what happens to us right now is our life.  This is what makes sense.  Is being busy is the goal of your life?  Maybe if something more? <br><br>  I believe that we should replace all this fuss with something that has value for us.  Something that matters.  And even if we do something important, do not do it all the time, leave time for relaxation, for pleasure, for happiness.  Otherwise, there is no need to live. <br><br>  It is necessary to rediscover for yourself what it means to do nothing.  Sit quietly.  Enjoy the silence.  It is necessary to leave more space between classes, and not to glue them into one continuous piece of fuss.  Let's stop rushing and get happier. <br><br><h4>  How to become less busy </h4><br>  It all starts with a decision - I want to be less busy.  I no longer want what I have now. <br><br>  What happens next depends on who sets up your daily routine. <br><br><h5>  If you have a flexible work schedule </h5><br>  Make two lists.  In the first one, describe your ideal working day - all that you like in your work, what you would like to do.  In the second - all the things you need to do, all your obligations.  Then start removing those commitments that are not in your ideal day.  Call the people to whom you promised to do something, and just say that you will not.  People will be disappointed, but it will not kill them. <br><br>  After that, start following your ideal day.  Be sure to leave enough space between cases so that you don't have to hurry.  Leave one big gap so you can spend time with your family, or go in for sports, or your favorite thing, or just relax. <br><br>  Look in the list of your affairs and think what you could remove or delegate.  Or just postpone.  Every day, choose three things that need to be focused.  Allocate one piece of time to email and to perform small tasks so that this work does not distract you later. <br><br>  Disconnect from the Internet for a period of time.  When you go somewhere, turn off your mobile phone, or leave it at home.  Then no one can interrupt you when you communicate with living people in the real world.  Remove everything that distracts your attention and interrupts you so that you don‚Äôt have to switch attention. <br><br>  Avoid meetings.  Seriously.  They just take time. <br><br>  Prefer single-tasking multitasking, focus on the important, not on a bunch of small things.  If you notice that you are opening a new tab in the browser, simply add this page to your bookmarks so as not to be distracted from the main document. <br><br>  Enjoy the serenity.  Relax.  Take a nap.  Breathe deeply. <br><br><h5>  If you are busy full time </h5><br>  Estimate that from the above you can do.  Perhaps you can do more than it seems.  Create a perfect day, get rid of obligations, simplify the to-do list, be single-tasked, remove things that distract you.  Most people can do it all. <br><br>  And also, talk to your superiors.  Tell them that you want to become more productive, and that distraction and ongoing meetings are getting in the way.  Preventing you from achieving more.  Tell your superiors what you want to achieve and how you would like to change your schedule for this.  Try to negotiate. <br><br>  Or consider changing your job if you are not able to control your work day at all.  Well, yes, this is a serious decision, but it is possible, and even useful.  At least think about it. <br><br>  In the end, whatever you do, you can always get rid of the rush just by changing your way of thinking.  Live the present and do not be distracted by extraneous things.  Stop, take a deep breath, enjoy the present.  Learn to see what is right in front of you and be at peace with what you are doing. <br><br>  And then raise your fist and with a quiet laugh of the winner threaten this ever-hurrying world. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/73288/">https://habr.com/ru/post/73288/</a></p>
