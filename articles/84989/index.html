  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Experience connecting robokassa</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Not so long ago, we decided to change the name of our <a href="http://www.finobox.ru/">service</a> .  Running a service on a new domain meant entering an app store. <br>  The task was to quickly connect the payment system.  It was important for us that users could pay for the purchase of applications both by electronic money and via SMS. <a name="habracut"></a><br>  Having made a cursory review, we found several systems - some accepted only electronic money, other credit cards. <br><br>  Here is a list of what suited us in terms of services in full: <br>  <a href="http://www.robokassa.ru/">www.robokassa.ru</a> <br>  <a href="http://www.sprypay.ru/">www.sprypay.ru</a> <br>  <a href="http://www.activepay.ru/">www.activepay.ru</a> <br>  <a href="http://www.assist.ru/">www.assist.ru</a> - listed as a fairly well-known service, but there is no SMS. <br><br>  Stopped all the same at Robokassa.  Quite well-known, large partners and the connection looked very simple - this played a role in our case.

      Understanding that we will have to withdraw money to a current account (which means we need at least a contract), we decided that we first register as a physical.  face.  and we will receive money for example on a Webmoney wallet.  Naturally I wanted to know whether it would be possible to change the form to jur.  face. <br>  A call was made to those.  support (looking ahead, I will say that there were several calls and never had to hang on the line, waiting for an answer) - explained the situation and I was told that of course then you can quickly change everything to legal entities. <br>  Fine.  Fill out the form and register.  The registration indicates the address of the site and a comment that we are going to actually sell. <br>  On the new domain hung a stub.  We planned to complete the transfer at the moment when the payment system works. <br><br>  The answer came: - ‚ÄúUnavailable resources, resources for reconstruction, development, site activation templates are not subject.‚Äù <br><br>  As it turned out that demonstrating the resource at the old address is also impossible. <br><br>  Another answer: - ‚ÄúOn the opening page (Site Url), information should be provided on your activities, products and services that you will be selling, prices for them and possible payment methods.  Or there are links to other sections of your site that display information about you and your site. ‚Äù <br><br>  It was decided to give those.  support test account and close registration on the new domain. <br>  At the same time, two responses to our request came: <br>  ‚ÄúTo consider the possibility of activating a resource with‚Äú secret information ‚Äùabout ongoing paid operations, you need to register with us as a legal entity.‚Äù <br>  ‚ÄúAccording to our records, your request has been resolved.  If you have additional questions, please reply to this letter. ‚Äù <br><br>  And no more comments.  I had to fill out the form on jur.  to face.  It turned out that payments can be accepted before the conclusion of the contract, we simply can not withdraw money to the current account.  It was necessary to fill the contract and send them.  The manager assigns a number and date and sends it back.  Further we sign and a helmet already by mail. <br><br>  The only thing is that everything did not work right away.  (I also note that they have a test server, which was not working at the time of our connection). <br>  Any attempt to buy something to buy appeared a window that the payment was not made and returned to the site.  The error status received programmatically said that "10 - money was not received, the operation was canceled."  So I had to make another call. <br>  Due to the fact that we were registered first as a physical person, and then as a legal entity.  face and they "where they did not put a tick." <br>  In principle, everything took no more than a day.  4 letters and 4 calls. <br><br>  PS It will also be useful to read the article <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/pay_sistem/82998/">about Robokassa clearly</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/84989/">https://habr.com/ru/post/84989/</a></p>
