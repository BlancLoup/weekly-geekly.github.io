In less than 8 years of its development, E-xecutive has united more than 100,000 registered users, gained quite good momentum and earned a solid reputation in its (it‚Äôs created) niche.  But he missed the first trends of the new wave of community sites, and with time he began to seem too clumsy and cumbersome alongside the ‚Äúyouth‚Äù.  The platform change, the work on the interface convenience and site structure, as well as the team‚Äôs big plans to return to the portal a noticeable role on the Web as a thematic media and effective human resource ‚Äî that was the background for the new veteran‚Äôs face. <br><br>  Changing the platform itself has become a very laborious and risky step, because it was changed from a ground-up, but very complicated own engine, to the rather controversial 1C-Bitrix system.  <a href="http://www.qsoft.ru/">QSOFT</a> , a Moscow-based company, has taken over the heroic efforts, which already has some experience in transferring major sites to Beatrix.  It will certainly be interesting for both supporters and opponents of this platform to see how it will work in difficult conditions for itself.  However, now the results of stress testing showed a very good margin of safety up to 1.5 million visitors per day. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Although it is too early, perhaps, to talk about the new impressions of the new version, we talked about them.  <a href="http://geektimes.ru/users/yagr/" class="user_link">Yagr</a> Yaroslav Greshilov, who works on the <a href="http://ilovecinema.ru/">ilovecinema</a> community of filmmakers (we wrote about it in detail <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blog/startup/29083.html">here</a> ), believes that now there are very significant changes in the situation for E-xecutive.  Now they must offer people something that no one has yet offered.  ‚ÄúThe first stage of the project‚Äôs life,‚Äù he says, ‚Äúcame at a time when there were no communities in runet.  Now the offer is simply redundant.  They will have to compete for the time of people who want to feel some kind of involvement in a whole (profession, for example) and somehow communicate within this whole, with a wide range of other communication sites, such as: communities in the blogosphere and the blogosphere in general, MyKrug and LinkedIn (especially these two projects), classmates with VKontakte, thematic community sites (like the same Habr).  This is the first. <br><br>  The second is that being a ‚Äúmanager‚Äù is no longer considered cool.  Shnur's song ‚ÄúMiddle Manager‚Äù and Minaev's book ‚ÄúDukhless‚Äù have already been released, the topic of downshifting has already gone out, the expression ‚Äúoffice plankton‚Äù has already appeared, all this does not contribute to the union in the community on the basis of caste managers, there is already a romance and perspective , there was one routine.

      Therefore, the key question now is: what will be the whole, under the flag of which people will unite?  Why do they come exactly there?  I think they missed the moment, they had to rebuild two years ago, when information about LinkedIn‚Äôs success was leaked here for the first time.  Now the entire audience has somehow been snapped up.  Another question is that they can simply implement a high-quality social network on a professional basis (because after my purchase, Yandex MoyKrug is trying to become classmates, not LinkedIn).  If they come up and manage to promote services and tools that will be useful to people in the professional space, then they can succeed.  But we must understand that we need efforts to initially attract people to the site.  By themselves, they will not come.  They are already somewhere. ‚Äù <br><br>  <a href="http://headhunter.ru/">HeadHunter</a> marketing director Olga Brukovskaya shared her opinion.  ‚ÄúE-xecutive is valuable for the market, as the first resource for professional communication of managers and marketers from different industries.  The market needs such a resource, but made by professionals in creating Internet sites.  We hope that the new version will not inherit the mistakes of the previous one and will be not only useful, but also usable service. <br><br>  Traditionally, the weakness has always been the usability of the site, and the lack of communication between the site‚Äôs trajectories of the user's movement within it with the habits of Internet users, as well as the content layout inside the portal, surprising in form and content.  I hope that in the new incarnation, while retaining its leading role for candidates and specialists - a platform for working with their professional reputation - the site will become a worthy Internet resource. ‚Äù <br><br>  An interesting view from the inside, from the side of regular visitors to the site with experience.  <a href="http://geektimes.ru/users/yaro/" class="user_link">yaro</a> Yaroslav Shvetsov, director of the Kazan <a href="http://knockknock.ru/">Design Bureau Knock Knock</a> is one of the regular readers of E-xecutive, closely following the development of the resource.  According to him, the community in its time brought him a lot of benefits, giving useful contacts, business contacts and contracts.  Recently, however, it became obvious that the site did not withstand any criticism in terms of convenience and usability.  ‚ÄúIt has become difficult to isolate the interesting, to focus on what is needed,‚Äù says Yaroslav, ‚Äúthere was not enough separation across sectors, industries, and at the same time highlighting the main news for everyone.‚Äù  From the technical side, there were not enough of the usual joys of life, such as, for example, customizable RSS feeds.  All this resulted in a banal lack of time to read the resource.  ‚ÄúHaving decided to rectify this situation, B2B Media took the right step, albeit a belated one,‚Äù he adds. <br><br>  The return of the stars to the ‚Äúring‚Äù always attracts attention and is accompanied by the aura of the newfound original meaning, idea, spirit of everything that happens.  And even if the initiative of the creators of E-xecutive by itself does not overwhelm the attention of the industry, it will definitely give a reason to think to the authors of all such community resources, perhaps clarifying something in their heads. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/19291/">https://habr.com/ru/post/19291/</a></p>
