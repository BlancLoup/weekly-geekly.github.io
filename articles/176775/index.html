You have the right to ignorance.  Do not read further if everything suits you now. <br>  The purpose of the article is to show that there are people with special thinking and psyche, that these properties define specific tasks and only a positive solution of problems allows you to be in harmony with society, psychological health and a sense of happiness. <br>  In short, <b>what a programmer needs to do in order to be healthy and happy.</b> <b><br></b> <a name="habracut"></a><br>  The term "programmer" is used for brevity, the following will be relevant for other people who feel a high capacity for abstract thinking. <br>  We describe a group of people to whom the text is addressed more accurately.  Check the description should be observable and sufficient to distinguish from the rest of the human mass. <br><br>  <b>How other people see us:</b> <br>  ‚Ä¢ Closed, thoughtful, not emotional.  Normal state "passive-contemplative position" <br>  ‚Ä¢ Slightly inhibited, because  constantly remain within themselves and to answer the question must return to the outside world, which takes some time.  Simple and stupid in their opinion questions can ignore at all. <br>  ‚Ä¢ Noisy companies, discos or at the very least sit in the corner watching things with indifference or indulgent arrogance <br>  ‚Ä¢ As a rule, tall and thin, usually inferior to peers in physical strength and vitality ("Botany") <br>  ‚Ä¢ Heightened self-esteem <br>  ‚Ä¢ Capable of abstract thinking and solving complex tasks requiring a high level of concentration <br>  ‚Ä¢ Indifferent or calm to the traditional values ‚Äã‚Äãof the type "money", "power", "beauty", "comfort" <br><br>  <b>How we feel and see from the inside:</b> <b><br></b>  ‚Ä¢ We need silence.  The best time of the day is the night when everyone has settled down. <br>  ‚Ä¢ People rush around and scream, while they act thoughtlessly, and the tasks they solve are small and stupid <br>  ‚Ä¢ From people we appreciate understanding most of all - what we meet least of all. <br>  ‚Ä¢ We translate tasks into a formalized form, annoying incomplete, inaccurate vague formulation of tasks by others. <br>  ‚Ä¢ To solve problems that we add to ourselves, while the rest believe that these are unnecessary features, complication, reinsurance ... <br>  ‚Ä¢ <b>We need a decent load on the brain.</b>  If it is not there, we load our processor with computer games, studying philosophy or religions, reading fiction.  Our processor can not stand idle at worst, just turn it off through sleep, alcohol, drugs.

      We see the difference in the mental device, which is based on the difference in the main property - the ability to abstract thinking. <br>  In order to feel the difference we will analyze different <b>types of thinking</b> : <br>  ‚Ä¢ Figurative thinking - the ability to see the whole picture and at the same time see and disassemble it into parts, to small parts and details, to pixels. <br>  ‚Ä¢ Analytical thinking - the ability to see and highlight a new quality and further share all the information on the basis of quality.  Divide everything into categories, by cell based on quality and properties.  In essence, take the whole apart and structure them. <br>  ‚Ä¢ Logical thinking - the ability for analytical thinking to add quantitative characteristics on the basis of which to decide or extend the picture of the world in the near future.  Essentially, forecasting based on probability or profitability, i.e.  on quantitative characteristics. <br>  ‚Ä¢ Abstract (synthetic thinking) ability to see common elements in scattered and fragmentary information and combine them into a system or law.  Ability to abstract from missing or unimportant information and build a picture of the world far ahead, based on the laws and system understanding of the device.  An example is the periodic table with the prediction of new elements. <br>  The good news is that nature has awarded us the thinking ability of the highest category! <br>  The bad news is that along with ability nature imposes on us the obligation to use it! <br><br>  If we do not use the ability nature cruelly and inevitably punishes.  And not only us, everyone else with their abilities, too.  Let's see who, for what and how? <br>  Owner of figurative thinking, such as a girl with huge expressive eyes, nature punishes with cruel neurosis, even hysteria, if she sees herself in the mirror as ugly or not fashionable.  Its task is to bring beauty to the world either by itself, or by works of art, or by the manifestation of spiritual beauty - compassion. <br>  The owner of analytical thinking must give the world products or works of art of the highest quality.  If he does not do this, he does not receive a positive response from the society about the quality of his work, he suffers from suffering and resentment.  In insult they go so far that a stomach ulcer or heart attack is almost a universal diagnosis. <br>  The owner of logical thinking, capable of making decisions based on logic and quantitative comparison, should give the world optimal control, saving resources, an abundance of goods - this is expressed in business, engineering solutions, trade.  Failure to fulfill its mission is punishable by soul-eating envy, brain-eating away with anger, even skin allergy, to a nervous tic on the face, with a corresponding transition bad mental states and illnesses - ‚Äúall diseases from nerves‚Äù. <br><br>  How does nature punish the owners of abstract thinking?  Also a direct impact on the brain, suffering, insomnia, headache, migraine.  After a headache, psychological disorders begin, followed by mental and physical ones.  And we are trying to deceive nature, load our heads with computer games, go to work as programmers and hang there for days solving far-fetched tasks, or trying to cut down the brain with chemistry (antidepressants, alcohol, even drugs in severe cases).  To think that nature has a weak lever (think the head hurts) is not necessary, the only type of people who do not imitate suicide (to be spared), but they do everything at once and specifically it is the owners of abstract thinking. <br>  You do not want to be punished, do what nature requires! <br>  ‚ÄúWhat does she want?  why did she give me super intelligence?  I didn't think about that! ‚Äù <br>  Oh, how many of us were killed because we did not think! <br>  Abstract thinking is designed to learn the structure of the world and indicate the right direction for the whole group to move forward.  Create a picture of the world of tomorrow, analyze options, indicate the best way. <br>  That is why Marx and others like him wrote such thick books, the best minds thought about the meaning of life, that is why many study Kabbalah, that is why they chase after the Higgs boson. <br><br>  <b>The hardest work is to think</b> , it is harder to think with great intelligence surrounded by small, cheerful and talkative ones. <br>  And it is also interesting that the society for which you are looking for the road will not thank you, most likely just will not understand anything in your life.  Therefore, nature will thank you directly, directly to the brain (as well as punishes).  Nature will thank flashes of happiness that will be much stronger and longer than the pleasure of any other brain, from a new lipstick, from sex, from a stolen million, from a million earned ... <br><br>  <b>Where to start?</b>  You can start <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DeVmWBbhNRJI%26playnext%3D1%26list%3DPLPAQjWOLUvMn6dyjlQOZIR3omP4HACLpW%26feature%3Dresults_video">from here</a> , (skip past the ears of what you do not understand, this is the middle, then return to the beginning, if you are with abstract thinking what you need you will understand, and from here, if not, do not look, you still will not understand) ... <br><br>  PS Programming is also an attempt to deceive nature; programming as such is not necessary for nature.  But do not drop it.  the brain will need to be fed and heated, the rest is optional. <br>  The question ‚Äúdo I need to deal with this issue?‚Äù The answer is ‚Äúno, do not, because if there are no abilities there will be no demand from you, if there are abilities, then nature asks, i.e.  not going to be impossible.
