The level of technical knowledge plays a very important role, but sometimes, due to trivial errors, one can simply not reach technical issues, even if they are planned in the first interview. <br><br>  These errors may be so subtle and not obvious to the candidate that he will not even understand that they are no longer considering his candidacy, although they still talk to him and even ask about the possible time of the next interview.

    <blockquote>  You probably already know something about our company? </blockquote><br>  This is one of the most frequent questions.  Personally, I had periods when interviews were every day.  In addition, I also worked.  There was little time to study the activities of companies, and sometimes I didn‚Äôt even know anything about the company.  For this I paid a lot and more than once.  Answers in the form: "I did not have time" or "I ran superficially only" leave you very little chance. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  It is very important not only to understand what the company is doing, but also to test their product (if possible), see what requests are being made when loading the main page, how many Kb are loaded, etc.  - Anything that can give you an idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe company's product.  Perhaps you will not find anything special, and perhaps you will have thoughts about how you would do it.  And then during the interview you can say something like this: ‚ÄúI saw that you solved the problem in this way, and I solved a similar problem in this way‚Äù and this is a chance to show off technical knowledge.  This is nothing, but it shows that you are serious about finding a job. <br><br><blockquote>  Why do you want to work abroad? </blockquote><br>  This question is relevant for programmers from post-Soviet countries.  In the West, little is known about the real situation in Russia, Ukraine, Belarus and other CIS countries.  Therefore, by asking this question, they want to see that you are NOT trying to escape from lawlessness and the criminal regime in search of a better life by clinging to the first job offer abroad.  It is necessary to say that you are looking for ways to gain new experience and that you can also bring your experience and knowledge to foreign companies.  This is important, because this way you will show that you know and are proud that you are a good specialist. <br><br><blockquote>  Tell us about your strengths </blockquote><br>  It is very important to build for yourself a clear structure of answers to questions about your work experience, about your achievements and even failures.  Here you need to talk about your greatest achievements, and while you talk, your eyes should shine.  It is also very important to talk about your achievements in the context of teamwork.  Because if you say only ‚ÄúI did this, I did that, I ...‚Äù then you obviously will not look like a team player. <br><br>  If you are 35+ and you are not applying for a Lead / CTO position, then you need to talk about your greatest strength and that you are a source of experience and knowledge for others.  You also need to be modern in your views on the life of the younger generation. <br><br><blockquote>  Who do you see yourself in the perspective of 5 years? </blockquote><br>  This question is asked to see your ambitions and see if you have worked in the company for at least 2 years.  Here you need to answer completely honestly and sincerely.  It is necessary for yourself to clearly articulate what you want and tell about it.  I advise you to think carefully about the answer to this question. <br><br><blockquote>  What are your disadvantages? </blockquote><br>  Since everyone has flaws, therefore, the answer in the form ‚ÄúI have no flaws‚Äù will be a failure.  Here you need to show that you are solving problems, but do not move away from them.  There are many articles on the Internet on this topic.  Often they write in the form of examples that you need to talk about perfectionism, as a flaw, and tell you that you have overcome this flaw through your personal experience in team development and realized that not only you can do everything correctly.  I think that this example should not be taken as the basis of your answer.  You need to think about your shortcomings (concerning work) and answer this question in the form of ‚ÄúProblem‚Äù - ‚ÄúSolution‚Äù <br><br>  They may also ask about the level of wages.  There is no need to hurry, as there are many unknown moments, but it is important to show that you are interested in the question of life in the country of the company in which you are interviewing.  This will show your real interest and seriousness in the matter and will also help to avoid answering the question of salary, since it will be clear that you are not still aware of all your expenses and it is difficult for you to talk right now about amounts. <br><br>  Not all of these questions can be in the introductory interview and they can go in a different order.  It is important to understand that the introductory interview is important.  You need to prepare for it. <br><br>  - A little about the demand <br>  These are open vacancies: <br>  Frontend - JavaScript, Angular.Js, React.js <br>  Backend - Java, PHP, NodeJs <br>  Devops <br>  QA <br>  iOS / Android <br>  UI / UX designers - sometimes (although yesterday an agent asked for a Finnish company) <br><br>  Senior level / TeamLead.  Also middle with a technical level above average. <br><br>  Like <a href="https://www.facebook.com/coolitrabota">facebook</a> group to keep abreast of all vacancies. <br><br>  Have a good day! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/299172/">https://habr.com/ru/post/299172/</a></p>
