It all started quite harmlessly: being a tenth-grader, I filled up the regional computer science Olympiad, after which I decided to prove to myself that I was a good programmer ... <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The very next year, everything turned from head to foot: a prize place and admission to the university for an IT-specialty at the Faculty of Computer Science.  Teachers, in the majority - leading specialists of large IT-firms of Voronezh, treated us, the students, very strictly and put us in conditions as close as possible to the fighting ones.  But one theory and academic challenges in the IT world will not be full, so at the 4th year I started thinking about finding a job.

      However, in the end, the work itself found me.  One November evening on a rainy evening, Andrey Belyaev, the teacher of the native department and the leading DataArt specialist, knocked on ICQ and offered to send a resume to the position of an iOS trainee.  I sent the letter, not really hoping for success: to be honest, I didn‚Äôt know much about the iPhone and iOS before, I didn‚Äôt hold real devices in my hands, and I didn‚Äôt even imagine how to combine my studies in two departments with work. <br><br>  ... And then everything began to turn: an interview, after which I mentally said "thank you" to my mentors, a proposal to work, getting to know iOS and Mac OS X, successful practice, the first combat projects.  Most of all, of course, overtime was remembered by long autumn evenings, when it was necessary to save the sinking project, and the long-awaited upgrade to middl.  And all this flashed for some six months! <br><br>  And then ... A few more months flew by.  A new project at the junction of two IT areas, followed by several more interesting projects, presentations at internal corporate seminars and regional conferences ... I met a university graduate in the 5th year with a specialist with almost one and a half year development experience.  And the best present, albeit with a delay of a month, for me was the increase to signor - the project leaders appreciated my modest contribution to the development of the application architecture and several main modules, as well as the optimization of problem areas. <br><br>  Since then, we live like this: DataArt for me is like a second home, where every day I learn something new from the IT world and communicate with friends.  I try not to forget about the university - graduate school and teaching help to distract from work problems.  Now I myself am an equally strict teacher, educating future programmers. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/292200/">https://habr.com/ru/post/292200/</a></p>
