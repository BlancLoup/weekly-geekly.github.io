Along with solving local problems, IT departments have to follow global trends, here both Big Data analyst and cloud services, and ensuring employee mobility, and using their own devices for business purposes, all this entails increased security requirements.  There is a transition from the traditional IT model to the so-called New Style of IT, from monolithic systems to distributed virtualized systems, where accessibility of applications and services, rather than individual pieces of equipment, becomes a key criterion. <br><br>  How to optimize the return on investment in IT infrastructure, especially if it is a modern, complex convergent systems?  How to achieve their stable, uninterrupted work, to minimize losses due to downtime, moreover - to prevent them?  And if a problem arises - how to quickly fix it and avoid a repetition of similar situations in the future?  Without the help of a vendor often can not do. <br><br> <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/hpe/blog/276015/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/389/bae/ef5/389baeef56ad4a06a7e7df2eebe8346a.png"></a> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  <font color="#00b882">Three in one</font> </h2><br>  Modern IT systems require at least modern, qualified support.  Such support should be personalized, proactive and simple.  Personalization means that the support service not only knows the end customer in person ‚Äî the customer is assigned a dedicated manager, a kind of ‚Äúfamily doctor‚Äù, with whom he will continue to work.  Proactiveness is the solution and elimination of problems before they occur.  Well, simplicity implies that the decision to support should be simply and clearly arranged, and the portfolio of proposals for technical support, in turn, is logically built and easy for the customer to understand.  In developing their service offers for corporate clients, HPE tried to take into account <a href="http://www.complete.ru/service/hp-proactive-care">all the needs of supporting modern IT infrastructure.</a>

      <a href="http://www8.hp.com/ru/ru/business-services/it-services.html%3FcompURI%3D1380514">The HPE service portfolio</a> includes Foundation Care reactive support for incidents that have already occurred, comprehensive support for individual Proactive Care systems (as well as its advanced version Proactive Care Advanced) and support for the entire Datacenter Care IT environment.  In addition to technical support, there is also a block of one-time technical services, covering one-time services, starting from the planning stage of changes and creating a strategy, through design and implementation services to services for optimizing equipment and IT processes.  Proactive Care is a kind of add-on to Foundation Care, adding proactiveness to this level of service. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d16/295/26b/d1629526bdd32ba3467f508f41540832.jpg"><br><br>  The HPE Proactive Care services block combines proactive work to prevent problems and work to quickly resolve problems already encountered.  The support solution is structured in accordance with the three principles of service provision listed above, and the ideas of what modern support should be: personalization, pro-activity and simplicity. <br><br>  Personalization in this case means that the customer has access to a pool of specialists called Remote Technical Support Managers (Technical Account Manager, TAM) who know the customer‚Äôs infrastructure based on automated reports, and for quick diagnosis and resolution of incidents - direct access to experts hotline number.  A support center specialist is a single ‚Äúpoint of contact‚Äù.  He deals with the problem from start to finish, which allows it to quickly qualify, has access to the necessary information about the configuration of the client‚Äôs equipment. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#00b882">Basis - HPE Insight Remote Support</font> </h2><br>  At the heart of Proactive Care is the HPE Insight Remote Support (IRS) remote monitoring and automated admission application platform. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/407/d0b/fe5/407d0bfe564d33292864ff0944820cae.jpg"><br><br><h2>  <font color="#00b882">The ‚Äúsecond layer‚Äù is Foundation Foundation reactive support levels.</font> </h2><br>  The next layer is the priority support center of the Advanced Solution Center, with a separate phone and quick access to experts, but more on that below. <br><br>  With the help of IRS, you can monitor the operation of equipment and software in real time.  The system takes readings from sensors built into the equipment, as well as from an agent in the operating system (if used) and provides data for analysis.  Reports are automatically generated on the HPE Support Center portal, each of which can be discussed with TAM, its comments and recommendations can be received.  Three types of reports are provided: <br><br><ul><li>  Report on incidents that occurred in the system.  It allows you to organize incidents, clarify their contents with a specialist. <br><br></li><li>  Report on software and firmware versions.  It helps in the correct sequence and timely software update.  The software update sequence is especially critical for highly integrated systems. </li></ul><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a3c/735/54f/a3c73554f600b25117795f4c1343ea1d.jpg"><br><ul><li>  Proactive scanning - a report at the junction of the equipment and software.  It helps to trace the relationship between various problems in the software and hardware complex as a whole. </li></ul><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/856/0c1/b2f/8560c1b2f42c4c8e267a786d643e503c.jpg"><br><br>  The IRS also helps to proactively notify about threats and prevent unplanned downtime, having high accuracy in troubleshooting and at the same time speeding up the resolution of requests by an average of 40%. <br><br>  Finally - about simplicity.  The HPE Proactive Care support package consists of a set of service components, for which it remains only to choose one of three options for reactive support, decide whether a assigned field support manager is required, and decide on the need for a set of one-time proactive services. <br><br>  So what are the benefits of HPE Proactive Care? <br><br><ul><li>  Cost-effectiveness of IT infrastructure support.  Essentially, this is an entry-level proactive support solution that helps save by using remote support technology and remote personnel.  And you can choose the level of support that meets the objectives of the business. <br><br></li><li>  The ability to quickly solve complex problems through accelerated access to support experts, maintaining applications from beginning to end until they are resolved. <br><br></li><li>  Reduce unplanned downtime by monitoring and eliminating potential problems across the entire IT infrastructure. <br><br></li><li>  Quick return on equipment investment and data center performance. <br><br></li><li>  You can purchase Proactive Care at any time - both when purchasing equipment and later.  Support may cover the entire fleet of equipment (except rack-mount RISC servers).  The service is provided in Russian, and until the incident is resolved, the customer communicates with one support specialist, which speeds up the solution of the problem ‚Äî there is no need to explain again, and applications with the Proactive Care level have higher priority and are processed faster than Foundation Care applications. </li></ul><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/6f3/0c2/165/6f30c2165fd44a338820394830639389.jpg"></div><br>  The HP Mobile Support Center, a special mobile application and portal, allows you to remotely view all events, communicate with technical support, start cases, track their progress, etc. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#00b882">From HPE Proactive Care to Proactive Care Advanced: A Personalized Approach</font> </h2><br>  HPE Proactive Care is designed to prevent problems through the active use of automation technology and remote monitoring.  The development of this level of support was <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DthSE0_F4Bjc">HPE Proactive Care Advanced</a> .  This advanced version assumes the highest level of personalization and assistance, the use of allocated resources and the appointment of a Personal Support Manager (Account Support Manager, ASM).  The functions of the personal support manager include technical and operational recommendations.  He can always share the best industry experience, and also represents the customer within HPE and helps with the escalation of complex applications.  Previously, HPE already had a personalized option for Proactive Care with a fixed support manager.  Of course, it does not replace the call center or application via the Internet, but it can always help speed up the solution of this application and suggest something - how to solve the problem, how to develop, what services to use to get the maximum benefit from the purchased services, how to correctly make changes in IT infrastructure, increase its efficiency. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b42/9da/23e/b429da23ee028377c1788e511dcc1e0e.jpg"><br><br>  The human factor is very important.  For example, for support levels with guaranteed recovery, it is extremely useful to have a assigned engineer who knows and understands your infrastructure.  Such a specialist is included in the HPE Proactive Care Advanced option with the recovery of equipment performance within 6 hours from the moment the application was submitted.  Together with a technical specialist, in Proactive Care Advanced, ASM draws up a plan of support reviewed every six months, gives its recommendations, answers any questions that may arise. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/6d4/948/435/6d4948435d91428c9aa24ad0b15835da.png"></div><br><br>  HPE Proactive Care Advanced is a relatively new component in the HPE Packaged Support Services portfolio. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e2d/f15/b16/e2df15b16f66d2a701e206de2f812cba.jpg"></div><br>  This is a business-critical service designed to support the most critical infrastructure for a business, quickly eliminate and, most importantly, prevent problems.  HPE Proactive Care Advanced inherits all the characteristics and features of HPE Proactive Care: <br><br><ul><li>  Active use of the platform for remote monitoring and automated enrollment of HPE Insight Remote Support. <br><br></li><li>  Three levels of reactive support to choose from (support on working days during working hours, round-the-clock support and support with a guaranteed recovery of 6 hours). <br><br></li><li>  Quick access to the specialists of the Center for Priority Support and maintaining the application from the beginning to the end. <br><br></li><li>  Remote technical support manager. </li></ul><br>  In addition, HPE Proactive Care Advanced includes accelerated mechanisms for the escalation of incidents, Critical Event Manager can deal with the escalation of the request.  Its functions are to eliminate the problem and prevent its recurrence.  For support levels with the restoration of equipment performance for 6 hours, a dedicated engineer is assigned to the client. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/192/1ac/7f0/1921ac7f0fd8a167c038e5657dc37aa2.jpg"></div><br>  The support level can be applied to both HPE Integrity servers and to middle-class servers, storage systems, corporate switches and routers, converged systems for clouds and Big Data.  This is an evolutionary development of HPE support programs. <br><br>  Proactive Care Advanced also includes 10 Proactive Select credits annually for each individual device (for example, a rack server, storage system, or blade basket).  HPE Proactive Select credits entitle you to order one-time HPE technical services for early problem solving.  The range of Proactive Select services is very wide.  These are optimization, analysis of system performance, firmware upgrades, thermal analysis of data centers, ITSM analysis, SAN research, etc. <br><br>  HPE Proactive Care - focuses on primary and intermediate systems, Proactive Care Advanced - from middle to high class, convergent systems.  Proactive Care and Proactive Care Advanced are related by a common base, similar pricing (by product).  If Proactive Care is an improvement in work with applications and the initial level of pro-activity through the use of an automated support tool, then Proactive Care Advanced focuses on increasing the impact of IT and maximum personalization. <br><br>  We think that now you know the answers to the questions posed at the beginning of the article.  HPE Proactive Care and Proactive Care Advanced services are actively used by customers around the world, which allows them to maximize the return on investment in IT infrastructure, prevent downtime, speed up problem solving, thanks to a personalized approach, proactive work and a high level of expertise.  Proactive Care Services can be purchased from HPE sales representatives, as well as from a worldwide network of authorized partners. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/276015/">https://habr.com/ru/post/276015/</a></p>
