  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Habrahabr and Public Relations</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  <em>Public Relations</em> , contrary to popular belief, is not pushing your product, start-up, blog, lobbying your interest or promoting your ideas in any way, based on the belief that all means are good, and if you have to go over the corpses, it's also not scary.  <em>Public Relations is the science and art of establishing and maintaining good relationships with the public</em> .  Operating with PR categories, the public is different: internal and external (people outside the company and employees of the company).  There are several other divisions: media, consumers, employees ... In general, the public is all people around a PR person, and you need to be able to build and maintain good relationships with them. <br><br>  Why do I actually write this, and why I publish it on Habr√©?  I want to give a couple of tips to managers: I‚Äôm keen on public relations, I don‚Äôt officially deal with them professionally, in fact, all my work consists in building and maintaining good relationships both between certain company departments that have direct and indirect relationship to international activities, and with external counterparties.  So I know what I'm talking about.  It always seemed to me that PR in its correct sense is a weak point of TM.  <em>Guys, maybe you should take some time to read a couple of books by foreign PR writers?</em>  You are building a social network, working with people.  Such knowledge does not hurt you. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>

      Why did I say that PR is a weak point of the company?  Because TM is, from the point of view of the company, a public company.  When any actions occur on the part of the administration, any changes are made, the habrasoobschestvu must be promptly informed, informed, properly cover events.  What is not ‚Äúright‚Äù, i.e.  as it would be beneficial for the administration, and not hiding any negative points, but writing WHAT happens and WHY it happens.  Ideally, also answer two eternal questions (who is to blame and what to do, of course) if there is such a need.  It is necessary to pay tribute to the administration, recently the situation with this has improved a lot.  The administration has begun to write more similar messages for the community, but in my humble opinion, this is not enough.  I judge it by the current situation on Twitter and by itself.  If different people, without saying anything, think and say the same thing, you should definitely pay attention to it.  Moreover, all these people are quite adequate.  Why do so many people want to leave here?  Increasingly, I hear the phrase ‚ÄúHabr is no longer the same‚Äù, and increasingly I catch myself on the same thought.  I think we need to do something about it.  <em>Therefore, I invite Habrasoobschestvo and administration to the dialogue.</em>  <em>Let's think and discuss how and why it happens, what specifically does not suit us in the current situation, how to fix it</em> . <br><br>  Personally, I do not like party policy.  Why all these bans?  What is completely solved by a calm dialogue develops into a scandal.  I am not satisfied with the situation with the content.  Correctly said gimlis, and supported him in the comments, Habr - this is not the chips.net.  At this particular moment in time, there is a lack of good, original, interesting authoring content.  <em>Maybe you should hire a couple of bloggers who would temporarily supply the community with good and interesting content, if the principle of user-generated content still leaks?</em> <br><br>  I understand, you can say, instead of shouting where the world is heading, you can direct its movement yourself.  Instead of saying that Habr is not the same, you can publish interesting author articles yourself.  Unfortunately, not everyone can do it.  Many only read the resource.  Others have a talent to write, but there is no time, energy, desire, health to do it (everyone can choose their own version of excuse). <br><br>  I do not know how the administration will react to my topic, but I invite everyone to express their thoughts in the comments.  I can not help Habra by writing interesting thematic content, as mentioned above.  All I can do is write this post and direct everyone to the dialogue.  I do not pretend to the only correct opinion in the highest instance, but I want to hear the thoughts of the community and the administration about the current state of affairs.  I do not care what will happen with this topic - will it be populated or will be strongly minted.  But if they banned me for my free thoughts, I would be very disappointed. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/38021/">https://habr.com/ru/post/38021/</a></p>
