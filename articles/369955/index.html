We were left with only one and a half years of carefree shopping: a reduction in the duty-free threshold to ‚Ç¨ 500 was announced in the middle of 2018, and then to ‚Ç¨ 200 - a year later. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/24d/a40/e57/24da40e57d4a4b575d3853aa38194fae.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  According to <a href="http://www.vedomosti.ru/economics/articles/2016/12/06/668328-poshlini-internet-posilok-500">Vedomosti</a> , the schedule for tightening duties is tied to the adoption of the Customs Code of the Eurasian Economic Union (EAEU).  The Ministry of Finance expects the code to come into force in mid-2017, a year later the threshold will be reduced by half to ‚Ç¨ 500 per month (over this amount the duty will be 30%, but not less than 4 euros per 1 kg), and another year later - up to 200 euros (with a duty on top of 15%, but not less than 2 euros). <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The announcement of the tightening of the rules took place exactly one month after the <a href="http://kremlin.ru/acts/assignments/orders/53215">intervention in the question of</a> Vladimir Putin, which contained, among other things, the following order:

    <blockquote>  consider questions about ... introducing changes in the legislation of the Russian Federation on taxes and fees that provide for the collection of value added tax and customs duties on foreign Internet sites and suppliers when selling goods of foreign manufacture to Russian individuals </blockquote><br>  The government considered the issue and ordered to refuse the wet dreams of ACIT ( <a href="http://www.akit.ru/">Association of E-commerce Companies</a> - the main lobbyist for increasing duties), for several years demanding the introduction of a virtually ‚Ç¨ 22 threshold, but also a two-hundred-threshold threshold greatly reduces the space for maneuver - goodbye not only iPhones from the USA , but also top Chinese smartphones with Ali. <br><br><h2>  Is this all bad news? </h2><br>  Unfortunately not.  It is easy to see that the instruction deals not only with duties, but also with VAT on purchases from abroad.  This issue is also on the agenda: <a href="http://www.interfax.ru/business/539905">Interfax reports</a> that ‚Äúin order to create equal conditions for Russian and foreign players in the online trading market, it is preferable to force foreign players to pay VAT at the place of receipt of revenue and profit.  According to Deputy Prime Minister Arkady Dvorkovich, the government can submit a proposal to the State Duma during the spring session. <br><br>  The overall picture, therefore, appears as follows: for 2.5 years, the threshold of duty-free purchases from abroad will drop to ‚Ç¨ 200 + somewhere in the next six months the government‚Äôs plans for VAT will become clear. <br><br>  With VAT, by the way, not everything is so simple - you can read about my <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/pochtoy/blog/282398/">last post</a> about it.  In short, it is unlikely that foreign online stores will line up for paying taxes to the Russian treasury - rather, many of them simply ban the Russian market completely (which will not upset the local resellers). <br><br>  Even if the postal services can take on the role of a tax agent, it‚Äôs not a fact that the duty of 15‚Äì30% + VAT, cumulatively guaranteeing a rise in prices for foreign purchases by at least a third, will leave at least some sense in it. <br><br><h2>  What does Pochtoy.com think about this? </h2><br>  If you ask why the opinion of Pochtoy.com is relevant here, everything is simple: this company, like other small forwarders (Shopfans, Banderolka), exists as long as the online shopping market from abroad exists.  Those.  Literally mail forwarders are in the same boat with customers. <br><br>  So, on the street of the maelforder today is a holiday - at least, the announced plans are far from prohibitive $ 22, the introduction of which scared almost by the summer.  At least a year and a half, you can live as before.  In this sense, of course, the terrible end announced - i.e.  finally announced the reduction of the duty-free threshold - brings relief from the horror without end in the form of constant foreboding shoe that will crush your business. <br><br><h2>  How serious is it? </h2><br>  As <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/pochtoy/blog/283440/">noted</a> in the discussion of this news, this is at least the second attempt of the government to announce the reduction of the duty-free threshold as a decided matter: <b>in January 2014,</b> then Minister of Economic Development Alexei Ulyukayev <a href="http://www.infox.ru/hi-tech/internet/2014/01/28/Vlasti_ogranichili_o.phtml">had already announced</a> that the duty-free threshold would be reduced to ‚Ç¨ 150.  What went wrong? <br><br>  At that time, the <a href="http://izvestia.ru/news/564679">position of Kazakhstan</a> did not allow to accept this decision, allowing parcels to be transported without duties to ‚Ç¨ 1,500 - and they are not going to reduce it, because they earn money on transportation of goods from China to Russia in this way.  Unfortunately, <a href="https://tengrinews.kz/markets/snijenie-poroga-besposhlinnyih-internet-pokupok-307584/">judging by the Kazakh media</a> , this time the Russian lobbyists still pushed the consent of Kazakhstan, without which the whole undertaking would have no meaning - even if on the conditions of a gradual and not so radical, as they would like, reduction of the duty-free threshold.  Under such conditions, the Kazakh consumer suffers minimally: <br><br><blockquote>  <a href="https://tengrinews.kz/markets/snijenie-poroga-besposhlinnyih-internet-pokupok-307584/">The average check for Kazakhstanis from Aliexpress is only $ 50-70 per transaction.</a>  <a href="https://tengrinews.kz/markets/snijenie-poroga-besposhlinnyih-internet-pokupok-307584/">Moreover, he says, very few people order goods from Chinese sites more than once or twice a month</a> . </blockquote><br>  However, until all agreements have been officially approved, the situation may still change: <br><br><blockquote>  <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/pochtoy/blog/283440/">It will definitely be known after the signing of the agreement on the Customs Code of the EAEU, scheduled for the end of December and subsequent Kazakh regulatory legal acts</a> . </blockquote><br>  Now you can import private parcels worth up to ‚Ç¨ 1000 per month for free - with a duty of 30% above this amount. <br><br>  <i><b>Buy while you can:</b></i> <br> <a href="http://pochtoy.com/%3Flang%3Drus%26utm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_medium%3Dpost%26utm_campaign%3Dgeeks16"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/91a/388/404/91a3884042444f849c2fec2aa3d4cbce.png"></a> <br><br>  By tradition, the first order is a $ 5 discount on the <b>supergeek</b> promo code. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/369955/">https://habr.com/ru/post/369955/</a></p>
