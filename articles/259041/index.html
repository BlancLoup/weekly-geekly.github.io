For me, frank introvert, such an event is akin to Armageddon.  If I were a spherical horse in a vacuum, I would have arranged some small local party.  But it turned out 80 of the most diverse guests.  And here arises the main question.  Like all this assorted crowd to entertain.  I am fundamentally opposed to forcing someone to something.  And if you look for ‚Äúcontests for a wedding,‚Äù then it becomes scary to see this at your wedding.  As a result, we had to invent our contests with the presenter, taking only a few known and simple ones.  About one competition which is related to Habr's subject I will also tell.  I have not seen similar contests for a wedding.  Maybe someone will help.  I think that it can be used not only at a wedding.  Sources are attached. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h3>  Idea </h3><br>  We had the idea to make a game that would take place in the backstage of the holiday, without announcing the lead.  So that people accidentally bump into him.  Any quest.  But the quest is "social".  To interact with people.  For example, go and get acquainted with an arbitrary person.  Try to find the answer to a strange question.  How to find the quest?  Hanging QR codes or text links.  It looked something like this: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ecb/97b/8ea/ecb97b8ea0e244cfaabc6f19bd1c553e.gif"><br><br>  Considering that almost everyone has a mobile phone with an apple / android - to participate is not a problem.

    <h3>  Is there something ready? </h3><br>  I could not find.  Maybe blind.  There is a paid platform for conducting city quests that would be convenient for a wedding quest.  But they need an operator to count the answers.  There are many paid services for "carrying out quests in the corporate party."  But why should they, when my entire quest should have 4-5 questions and should not attract undue attention? <br><br><h3>  Filling </h3><br>  The questions were of several categories: <br>  1) Learn the name of the person depicted in the picture.  The simplest and, in my opinion, the most interesting part of the competition.  The question was asked twice.  The first time one of the groom's friends was generated, the second time - the bride. <br>  2) Find the answer to the text question.  The implication was that the people should ask others.  But the people are mostly googled. <br>  3) To do some kind of action for which you need to attract another person.  In this category, we had only 1 question. <br><br><h3>  Soft </h3><br>  The only solution that is quickly modified on the knee is a server that displays html content.  This solution will work on both android and ios and on the laptop.  There are already lots of ready-made examples, including on Habr√©, one of which I borrowed - <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/120157/">habrahabr.ru/post/120157</a> . <br>  Slightly modified.  Accept the request, return the page with the question.  He came up with a little logic in how the queries, pages and answers are named.  Sources posted here, tried to comment everything in detail - <a href="https://github.com/ZlodeiBaal/HttpQuest">github.com/ZlodeiBaal/HttpQuest</a> . <br>  Server-side http programming was done for the first time in my life, so I think that knowledgeable people would have done it much easier, faster and more qualitatively. <br>  In principle, the server and the questions in it are configured without knowing C #, but by modifying the files in the folders.  But you can not modify everything. <br>  Here you can test - <a href="http://193.138.232.71:777/">http://193.138.232.71:777</a> <br>  If the server crashes, here is a small video about how everything works: <br><br><iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/7oQVSh4xG0M%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700023,15700186,15700190,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhjUJhDDZfL6kUFEVU9U4DYoy0HLfA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><h3>  Cons and how it went </h3><br>  Judging by the survey after the wedding, many people participated, about 30-40 people.  All guessed five. <br>  Why people did not reach the end: <br>  1) I could not guess the person in the photo (there were a couple of non-trivial questions) <br>  2) The system did not accept the answer (I still did not understand why, I could never catch an error).  Perhaps some problems with the Internet.  Next to the restaurant was the embassy, ‚Äã‚Äãwhich was periodically complained that it jammed communication.  (yes, all possible spellings are accepted as correct) <br>  3) Laziness. <br>  4) were embarrassed. <br><br>  In general, the contest justified its purpose.  For more I did not count.  The people participating cheered up a little, there were a couple of memorable moments.  Positive. <br><br>  PS <br>  Of the other contests at the wedding, a slightly modified problem about prisoners went well - <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/250817/">habrahabr.ru/post/250817</a> <br>  Pss <br>  By the way, if someone knows other cool contests for a wedding of a similar orientation, maybe you can write them down here to help future generations? </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/259041/">https://habr.com/ru/post/259041/</a></p>
