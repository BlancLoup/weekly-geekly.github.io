      As expected, some of the protesters already put on the traditional masks of "anonymous" borrowed from the protagonist of comic writer Alan Moore's "V means vendetta" - a mysterious revolutionary who, with the support of the people, is trying to destroy the totalitarian regime in the country. <br><br>  On the eve of the Saturday protests, the BBC asked the author of the comic book to tell how his book became the inspiration for many protesters around the world. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>  <b>Gunpowder plot</b> <br><br>  According to Alan Moore, everything that exists in the universe originates in Northamptonshire (Great Britain), and borrowing a revolutionary mask from his book is no exception. <br><br>  In the 17th century, architect Thomas Tresham built a triangle-shaped church near the English town of Rushton, which to this day is considered one of the most amazing architectural works in Great Britain. <br><br>  The temple, which should symbolize the holy trinity, an ardent Catholic Treshhem raised in dissent with attempts by the authorities to introduce Protestantism throughout the country. <br><br>  It was this church that in 1605 became the center of dissident Catholics, among whom was the son of Tresham.  They were preparing a <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259F%25D0%25BE%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D1%2585%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B9_%25D0%25B7%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B3%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2%25D0%25BE%25D1%2580">Powder plot</a> - an attempt to blow up the parliament building, which ended in failure. <br><br>  <b>Rebel</b> <br><br>  At the beginning of the 17th century, the pockets that the people traditionally lit in the first days of November turned into attributes of anti-Catholic celebrations, during which the pope was stuffed. <br><br>  However, soon in this shameful "position" of the high priest was replaced by a terrorist figure of those times, the main organizer of the Powder Conspiracy - Guy Fox. <br><br>  But after 300 years in post-war Britain, the gloomy image of a rebel acquired a slightly different color, and the parents already enthusiastically told the children about Guy Fox and his attempt to blow up parliament.  At least it was in Northamptonshire. <br><br>  And although in those days the children hardly perceived Fox as a hero, they certainly did not consider the rebel a mean-spirited intruder, as he was portrayed a long time ago. <br><br>  <b>Revolutionary</b> <br><br>  In the early 80s of the last century, Britain launched a wave of protests against the policies of the party Margaret Thatcher.  The moods and ideas of these protests will later appear in the book V for Vendetta. <br><br>  It was at this time that the protesters again turned to the image of Guy Fawkes, a revolutionary who personified one man‚Äôs protest against the dictatorship. <br><br>  Parallel with Fox was first conducted by graphic artist David Lloyd, who actually prepared the illustrations for the comic book V for Vendetta. <br><br>  To create the image of a revolutionary, Lloyd acquired the mask of Guy Fawkes, which at that time were sold by the hundreds on the eve of the traditional celebration of Guy Fawkes Night. <br><br>  Surprisingly, it happened just when the rebel Fox‚Äôs traditional mask began to supplant the Americanized images of Halloween, and the very name of the holiday ‚ÄúDay of Guy Fox‚Äù was almost out of use, giving way to the more neutral name ‚ÄúBonfire Night‚Äù - which is celebrated in England so far . <br><br>  This is how the illustrator and author of the book saved the image of a revolutionary from disappearing from the pages of English iconography. <br><br>  If in the 80s the authorities showed some concern about this mask and historical overtones, by the beginning of the XXI century these worries were forgotten, until Hollywood masters who decided to add fresh colors to the history of the revolutionary from the comic book took up the task. <br><br>  <b>The most famous terrorist</b> <br><br>  The Hollywood film appeared on the screens during the period when anti-terrorism legislation was passed.  Obviously, it seemed so convincing to the British government that they closed their eyes to the events on Parliament Square, where demonstrators in masks of a famous terrorist in the country ravaged their actions. <br><br>  Soon, hundreds of other protesters around the world began to go on demonstrations under the masks of Guy Fawkes, and now they can be seen more often. <br><br>  <b>Negligence</b> <br><br>  Now the financial rules are far from ordinary capitalism, and in the world there is a situation where banks resemble a monarchy.  And their negligent attitude towards the low-income strata of the population and the middle class cannot but cause general indignation, sometimes it takes on terrible forms. <br><br>  Of course, modern methods of dealing with the dictatorship have changed a lot and become more humane.  However, the ‚Äúface‚Äù of today's protesters, borrowed from a Catholic rebel, reminds us that the revolutionary spirit still lives and is always ready to rebel against the injustice of officials, even if the tool to fight against them is virtual space and social networks, not gunpowder. <br><br>  <i>A summary of the article by Alan Moore</i> <br><br>  PS according to recent reports, Anonymous managed to <a href="">temporarily</a> <a href="http://www.theage.com.au/technology/security/cia-website-knocked-offline-in-anonymous-attack-20120211-1sy4w.html">put</a> the CIA site. <br><br>  PPS also, anonymous supporter from Morocco, managed to <a href="http://www.smh.com.au/technology/technology-news/350000-porn-site-users-compromised-claims-hacker-20120212-1sz6g.html">break</a> 350 thousand users of porn sites and collected a lot of personal information about their users. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/138024/">https://habr.com/ru/post/138024/</a></p>
