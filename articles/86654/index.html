  <section class="page js-page"><h1>VKontakte - you can only voluntarily join?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Not so long ago, I decided to delete my VKontakte account. <br>  It turned out that the service does not provide means for deleting an account.  Moreover, it actively impedes the exit of users from their tenacious embraces. <br><br>  Attempting to change the name led to a significant result: it turns out that the resource owners insist that users provide only true information about themselves.  The name change is now <b>FINE</b> , i.e.  For this (usually uncomplicated) action, you must enter a new name, as well as a <b>REASON FOR CHANGE OF A NAME</b> .  And they don‚Äôt accept reasons like ‚Äúwell, please!‚Äù  Well, I‚Äôm writing a reason (‚ÄúI would like to completely leave your social network, but since there is no possibility, I just try to remove all personal information‚Äù), click ‚Äúchange‚Äù ... And they offer me to enter my cell number!  Those.  then it‚Äôs like: if a user with such a name wants to change his name (obviously, the real one is fictitious), then at least we will have this person‚Äôs cellular phone, and it will be linked to a real person.  face through the phone number! <br><br>  Well, I sigh, enter my phone and ... <b>SUCH A PHONE ALREADY</b> HAVE USED SOMEONE <b>ANOTHER</b> ! .. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  And that's all.  Can not be removed from the network.  It is impossible to change the real name (driven from the very thoughtlessness) to a fictitious one ... But then you can join the network voluntarily - as the rules of the resource say.  Well, of course, the security services would still forbid people to compile a dossier themselves - what a saving of time and effort!

      PS If you do not have paranoia - this does not mean that you are not being watched! <br><br>  <strong>Continued:</strong> <br>  After reading the comments, I decided to use the account deletion service indicated by me below.  But before that I wanted to warn ‚Äúfriends‚Äù - among the list there are quite a few people who have contact with me only through VKontakt.  I want to warn everyone - it's <b>not that easy</b> !  First, the mass mailing of messages is limited to a list of recipients in the amount of literally a dozen people.  Then I decided to create a ‚Äúmeeting‚Äù indicating where and how I can be contacted.  It turned out that to create a meeting, you also need a phone number!  My, essno, did not fit.  I did not even try to create a group, it is obvious that the phone will be needed there.  There was only one option to notify the entire list - edit the data of the group in which I already own, and invite friends to it.  But I am not the only one who owns the group, it is quite useful, and this act would be very ugly.  Therefore, I gave up on everything, used the account data deletion service, and then closed access to it.  It's finished. <br><br>  <strong>UPDATE:</strong> <br>  Thank you very much for all the comments!  Particularly pleased to those comments in which the mention of the sites where I "light up" personal info. <br><br>  Special thanks for the link <a href="http://unvkontakte.ath.cx/">http://unvkontakte.ath.cx/</a> . <br>  Checked and used.  This site automatically deletes (with your desire and consent) all VKontakte account data available for deletion.  Those who want to do away with this time eater, and concurrently - voluntary dossier for those in power - I <b>highly recommend</b> ! <br><br>  Also, there is an official way to delete a page: you need to completely remove access to it in the privacy settings.  In this case, after a month, with inactivity, account data will be deleted.  <font color="#4444FF">update: so say official sources, habrayuzer in the comments in one voice say that no, accounts for several months so hang and are in the search.</font>  Also, to ensure inactivity, you can use the Habrayuser from the comments - change the password without looking at something unintelligible. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/86654/">https://habr.com/ru/post/86654/</a></p>
