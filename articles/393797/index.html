    <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Main technical characteristics: <br><ul><li>  5-inch 720p touchscreen </li><li>  TI OMAP 5 dual-core ARM Cortex-A15 processor </li><li>  2GB RAM </li><li>  Wi-Fi 802.11a / b / g / n, Bluetooth 4.0 (separately version with 3G / 4G / UMTS) </li><li>  32 GB of internal memory, two SDXC slots and microSDXC inside under the battery </li><li>  6,000mAh replaceable battery </li><li>  ports: HDMI video out, 2 USB 2 ports, 1 Micro USB 3.0, 1 Micro USB (charging), SIM Card slot </li></ul><br><br><h2>  How it all began </h2><br>  In 2007, 3 people involved in selling GP2x gaming consoles Linux and the community gathered a large number of ideas to improve the product.  However, the manufacturer was not interested.  Then they got the idea to make their console.  Soon, people in the community were found able to design circuit boards and device cases. <br><br><img width="70%" height="70%" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/7ed/b3d/593/7edb3d59302974d2c03036d7a6f9526e.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The main idea was to get a device capable of emulating at least an Amiga at full speed.  It should be as ‚Äúopen‚Äù as possible from the side of hardware and software. <br><br>  The development was carried out in close collaboration with the community.  Many of its members helped with the development of the operating system and drivers.  In 2008, the first working prototypes were presented.  In September, pre-orders began, and by December 2008 it was planned to begin shipping devices to customers.  But due to a number of delays, mainly related to the production of cases by the Chinese company, it became clear that the deadlines could not be met and users started receiving devices only in 2010. Then a number of problems followed from both the production and the management side, and at the time of 2011 the project was almost dead.  In total, about 2700 devices were delivered to customers and 1200 were planned. <br><br>  In early 2012, Michael Mrozek (also known as EvilDragon) led the team and took a number of steps to save the project.  Including: transfer of production to Germany (home of the project), investors were found, a number of constructive improvements were made.  All pre-orders of the 800MHz version were completed and, for a while, Pandora could simply be bought in the online store. <br><br>  Pandora was in demand.  Despite the iron that was outdated at that time (2010 - 2012), due to the openness of the platform and, as a result, the powerful community, it coped well with its main task, emulating various gaming platforms.  At the end of 2012, a version with a 1GHz processor was launched, which, of course, did not change the picture radically, but allowed to ‚Äúbreathe easier‚Äù. <br><br>  By the end of 2013, production was discontinued mainly due to the fact that some components and chips were no longer produced.  In spite of this, a number of spare parts can still be purchased on the official website, such as an LCD screen, its cable, battery, body parts, and so on. <br><br><h2>  Why now everything should go without incident </h2><br>  At the moment, at the helm is a man who has experienced enough pain and hatred during the work on the previous project.  All technical and organizational decisions are thoroughly checked and discussed with the community.  The main goal of Pyra is to save all the good solutions implemented in Pandora and fix the unsuccessful ones.  So this is a kind of bug fix. <br><br>  Video with a working prototype: <br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/d4t9Ys8wI6k%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700019,15700186,15700190,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhhvnc1KG5RniiDe9BHx1WflF-BUCg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><h2>  Where to read in detail </h2><br>  Forum: <a href="https://www.pyra-handheld.com/">www.pyra-handheld.com</a> <br>  Twitter project leader: <a href="https://twitter.com/EvilDragon1717">twitter.com/EvilDragon1717</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/393797/">https://habr.com/ru/post/393797/</a></p>
