  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Marquis, yes you have outdone the king himself! XIAOMI at MWC-2016</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Long before the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, ‚Äã‚Äãthere were rumors about the latest XIAOMI, the largest Chinese manufacturer of smartphones.  And if the appearance of the new flagship Mi5 was relatively predictable, then the information about the modification of the Mi4 to Mi4S, indeed, was more like rumors and vague guesses.  However, today the veil of mystery has fallen and the Chinese manufacturer has presented both new items.  The news quickly spread throughout the world, along with features and first impressions. <br><br> <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/gearbest/blog/271642/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/3a0/32b/61b/3a032b61b0ee4a148bc9d84dd0e56815.jpg"></a> <br><br>  Since the flagships will go on sale very soon and will surely appear in <a href="http://www.gearbest.com/%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_medium%3Dyulia%26utm_campaign%3Dg16">Gearbest</a> , we have gathered maximum information and we hasten to share it with you. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  Flagship mi5 </h2><br>  The smartphone was presented to the MWC, and on Twitter XIAOMI there was a statement about the official exit, and at the same time information about the main technical characteristics of the new product: <br><div class="oembed"><twitter-widget class="twitter-tweet twitter-tweet-rendered" id="twitter-widget-0" style="position: static; visibility: visible; display: block; transform: rotate(0deg); width: 500px; margin: 10px auto; max-width: 100%; min-width: 220px;" data-tweet-id="702424965946155008"></twitter-widget><script async="" src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div><br>  So, let's see what is the flagship?  First of all, this is a powerful internal stuffing: the latest Qualcomm Snapdragon 820 chipset with an Adreno 530 graphics accelerator and an X12 LTE modem, 4GB of UFS memory (this is a powerful and energy-efficient memory for mobile devices) and 128 GB of internal memory (there will also be a version with 3 GB of RAM and 32 GB of flash memory and with 3GB / 64GB).  The device is running an operating system Android 6.0 Marshmallow.  The smartphone supports cellular networks LTE, Wi-Fi 802.11 b / g / n / ac, Bluetooth 4.1 and NFC.

    <img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/db3/9f6/e85/db39f6e8555e49168b58b070961a1312.jpg"><br><br>  These are outstanding features, especially considering the physical characteristics of the smartphone: 5.15 inches 1080p IPS display, with a full sense of the lack of a frame on the sides and optimal use of the space above and below.  In the new flagship Mi5, XIAOMI abandoned the touch keys and built in the physical Home button on the front panel, combining it with a fingerprint scanner. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/77c/65b/599/77c65b59921040b98f68275b45adf92a.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/88b/8c4/006/88b8c4006f194191872a46d25af57157.jpg"><br><br>  Following the obvious market trends, the Chinese manufacturer did a great job on the design: the curved back panel is made in the Pro version from ceramics, the dimensions are 144.55 x 69.2 x 7.25 mm and the weight of 129 grams allows you to use the smartphone with one hand, it is completely not perceived as another shovel.  However, such thin features are not an obstacle to a hot heart, namely, a 3000 mAh battery.  Mi5 supports Qualcomm's Quick Charge 3.0 fast charging technology and has almost the highest current battery energy density. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f16/807/59f/f1680759f01241548b3a0630836e6c9f.jpg"><br><br>  Mi5 photo capacities are also distinguished among others by a camera with a Sony sensor (IMX298), which is protected by sapphire glass.  At the presentation and on social networks, the manufacturer showed photos of excellent quality in high resolution.  The camera uses Phase Detect autofocus, optical 4-axis image stabilization (the stabilization system detects and corrects various types of camera movement along four axes), also uses Deep Trench Isolation technology (deep slit isolation), which is responsible for accurate color reproduction.  The resolution of the front camera is 4 megapixels, everything is without frills. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/f9a/1e4/f6b/f9a1e4f6b81051f605a4a275fd4f834f.png"><br><br>  Until today, XAIOMI has been firmly established the status of an imitator of the iPhone.  Now it is not.  Judging by the results of the presentation and the first information about the device, an independent, copying flagship appeared in China.  Things are easy - to conquer the world. <br><br><h2>  A nonstop upgrade of the flagship Mi4 to Mi4S </h2><br>  Exit upgrade successful flagship remained a mystery until the presentation.  The surprise did take place: XIAOMI presented an updated version of Mi4 - Mi4S.  I must say, the update turned out to be large-scale and successful - this approach promises Mi4 a long life in its competitive niche. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/dd6/055/ad0/dd6055ad01aa4154866c3d9e841ba1bf.jpg"><br><br>  The smartphone has a Qualcomm MSM8992 Snapdragon 808 processor with an Adreno 418 graphics accelerator, 3 GB RAM and 64 GB of eMMC 5.0 internal memory (the only option).  Works updated version of the flagship operating system Android 6.0.  Unlike the previous version, which did not have a memory card slot, in the Mi4S smartphone it is possible to expand the memory using microSD up to 128 GB. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d25/7c2/8b5/d257c28b5f4445fb86f28ada06a3b93d.jpg"><br><br>  The frame of the 5-inch smartphone is made of metal, the back panel is made of 3D glass, curved on the sides.  On the back is a fingerprint scanner.  With a weight of 133 grams, the Mi4S has dimensions of 139.26 x 70.76 x 7.8 mm.  In this, in general, a thin case, it was possible to place the battery with a capacity of 3260 mAh with Qualcomm's Quick Charge 2.0 fast charging technology (the predecessor had this value of 3080 mAh). <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/d0a/27f/205/d0a27f205101bda6cd943ff2ef3a9310.jpg"></div><br>  The smartphone is equipped with 13 megapixel main camera and 5 megapixel front.  The camera uses autofocus and LED flash.  The smartphone will be supplied in black, white, gold and unusual purple case. <br><div class="oembed"><twitter-widget class="twitter-tweet twitter-tweet-rendered" id="twitter-widget-1" style="position: static; visibility: visible; display: block; transform: rotate(0deg); width: 500px; margin: 10px auto; max-width: 100%; min-width: 220px;" data-tweet-id="702413883319910400"></twitter-widget><script async="" src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div><br>  Although in fact the price for a smartphone starts from $ 260. <br><br><h2>  I want it already! </h2><br>  In China, sales of both smartphones will start on March 1.
