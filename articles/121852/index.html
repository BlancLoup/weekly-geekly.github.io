  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Check GUNNARS points</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Scrolling through the Habr and came across an <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/gadgets/121230/">article about glasses GUNNARS</a> .  After reading, I still have the feeling that the author is telling tales about miraculous glasses.  And yet, for the sake of interest, he opened the manufacturer‚Äôs website and saw that their glasses were being sold at the <a href="http://www.frys.com/search%3Fsearch_type%3Dregular%26sqxts%3D1%26query_string%3Dgunnars%26submit.x%3D0%26submit.y%3D0%26cat%3D0">nearby Fry's electronics store</a> for between $ 70 and $ 120.  Pretty expensive. <br>  Since I, like most habrayusers, spend most of my time in front of the monitor, each working day ends with a headache and overstrained eyes.  Especially the eyes start to hurt in the afternoon.  Breaks and charging for the eyes do not help much.  In the light of the above, I decided to personally check whether there are any tangible benefits from these glasses.  Moreover, Habr, after all, is not a yellow rag and I have a certain confidence in posts on the main page, how incredible they would be. <br><br>  In this topic, I will post updates every day about health and personal perception for 30 days (or less, if I see that there is no sense). <br><br><h6>  A little about the testing environment </h6><br>  My vision is from birth to so-so: -6.00 and -6.50, and in one eye there is very light astigmatism.  Already about five years I wear contact lenses.  The lenses dry up somewhere in 12 hours of wearing, so after 7-8 pm, I already feel discomfort. <br>  Fluorescent lamps hang on my head and I have two Dell 1907FP monitors on my desk.  Both monitors are calibrated with a calibrator built into Win 7. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/5b73dbba/cf66b5fc/ac3ceef5/ca5c2e27.jpg">

    <a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h6>  Test Log </h6><br>  <b>6/13/2011</b> <br>  Went after working at Fry's, more than half of the boxes returned to the GUNNARS stand.  That is, people buy and rent, after which the store puts these boxes back on the shelf and with a small discount (in this case, they removed 5 bucks for an open box).  I have a presentiment, glasses shamefully fail the check.  On the shelf were 4 types of frames, I took the <a href="http://www.gunnars.com/shop/MLG-PHANTOM.html">Phantom Onyx</a> .  Glasses are light, yellow, slightly increase the image.  Since my eyes already hurt, I decided to postpone the test on the trail.  day. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/14a6fa8f/4548ef0b/1bb82729/603fb4ed.jpg"><br><br>  <b>6/14/2011</b> <br>  In the morning put on glasses, my wife laughed - decided that for the experience you can suffer.  Started to work (i.e. opened Habr :)).  After a couple of hours, he took off his glasses and suddenly it became unpleasant to look at the bluish monitor and the lamps above his head.  He worked for two minutes without glasses and felt his eyes ache.  Wore glasses again.  After lunch, sat at a rally about vulnerabilities in the code.  I noticed a curious thing: I take off my glasses - I feel irritated by dryness.  I put on - the feeling disappears. <br>  Around 3:30 pm, eyes began to ache even with glasses.  I'll go for a break. <br>  At the end of the working day, the result is such - the eye muscles ache; there is a slight sensation of dryness.  But still better than 24 hours ago. <br>  At 8 pm I sat down at my home Samsung 2220WM without glasses.  After 5 minutes, my eyes peeled and fell ill.  Wore glasses, eyes still tweaks a little, but already I look without pain. <br>  At the end of the day, I want to say that the glasses do not get tired so much.  This does not negate the need for periodic warm-ups, but the effect is clearly present.  It remains to be determined whether it is the merit of these particular points, or just a yellow filter.  Goodnight! <br><br>  <b>6/15/2011</b> <br>  This morning, I came to work, my eyes in the reference state - they do not hurt or cut (as it should be after sleep).  I must note that without glasses, the blue tint of the monitor and office light causes hostility, especially in comparison with the warm tones of the glasses.  Perhaps this is a self-suggestion, and perhaps not. <br>  By the way, last night I was driving home with glasses and noticed an unpleasant feature.  The sun was still high, so everything that could reflect the light directly into the eyes reflected.  So the glasses gave blue highlights on the windows of cars, and the highlights are defocused. <br>  The day was fine.  It is very pleasant not to feel pain in the eyes at the end of the working day.  I want to find some other yellow glasses easier to compare sensations. <br><br>  <b>6/16/2011</b> <br>  Last night, I noticed that the second day I went to bed without cramps and dry eyes.  As if I hadn‚Äôt sat in front of the monitor all day. <br>  In addition, yesterday I wrote that without glasses it became unpleasant to look at the monitor.  Today I experimented a little longer and came to this conclusion: What is it? Without glasses, I see a flickering white halo around the letters.  This effect is caused by <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2594%25D0%25B8%25D1%2584%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BA%25D1%2586%25D0%25B8%25D1%258F">diffraction</a> , when white light begins to bend around black thin lines of letters and distort the image.  With glasses, this effect is not so noticeable and the eyes strain much less.  It is possible that glasses suppress this effect due to the clever geometry of the lenses.  I do not pretend to be scientific, but I seem to have described the observed effect quite accurately. <br><br>  <b>6/17/2011</b> <br>  I read a lot of new comments, agree with some, and some do not.  I am still skeptical about these glasses because there is no sensible explanation of how they work.  But work.  Of course they do not relieve fatigue, for this you still have to take breaks.  But at least gone pain in the eyes and a feeling of dryness.  About the dryness is not surprising, just glasses trite protect eyes from air flow.  But the eyes do not hurt and at the end of the day the head does not hurt. <br>  Let's just say that if Gunnars is a ridiculous iPhone among the glasses, and there are cheaper analogues to it, then I think it‚Äôs worth trying these glasses.  At least in order to give your eyes a little rest. <br><br>  <b>6/20/2011</b> <br>  Over the past weekend, I was not able to sit behind the monitor in any serious way - matters, and <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2594%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD%25D1%258C_%25D0%25BE%25D1%2582%25D1%2586%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2">Father's Day is</a> celebrated in the states.  For some reason, Wikipedia translates Father's day as Fathers Day - as if there could be several of them (we don‚Äôt take border cases!).  Despite this, I still looked a bit like glasses to see if there were any advantages in everyday wear.  On Saturday evening I put on my glasses and went to the graduation resident neurologists.  I want to note that while the sun is in the sky, I did not feel much discomfort (as well as comfort).  The fact that everything seemed yellowish around did not bother much.  It was disturbed by the fact that it was very light and the eyes were tired of the light - these glasses are not a substitute for ordinary sun.  But when dusk began to come on, it became really dark with glasses.  Apparently this is due to the fact that blue tones predominate at dusk, and since the glasses filter this spectrum, the eyes simply do not have enough light.  Therefore, at this moment I took off my glasses and finished the experiment on it. <br>  Conclusion: these glasses Gunnars, although they look stylish, still are not a substitute for ordinary sunglasses, and wearing them in everyday life does not make sense.  Why did I mention the style?  Because I made such a compliment.  :-) <br><br>  In addition, today I decided to document the sensations when working without glasses.  Just to refresh the sensations.  So now, after 3 hours of work, I had a feeling of pain in my eyes.  By dinner, the eyes are dry and cut.  Put on glasses. <br><br>  <b>6/21/2011</b> <br>  Today I spent all day wearing glasses almost without a break.  By the end of the day, the eyes hurt, but they did not cut or tear.  I consider the experiment over. <br>  In addition, I passed these glasses and bought the <a href="http://www.gunnars.com/shop/Talon.html">Talon Galaxy</a> because of the more attractive rim.  I also talked to the owner of the store about these specific points and in general.  So, he claims that Gunnars transparent office glasses do not exist, that is, they are all yellow.  Glasses of different colors exist, but they are not office.  He also claims that there is no magic there: a yellow filter plus a small increasing effect. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/915/5f6/786/9155f678669bc79ab2cf90a3d1f5882f.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <i>My final verdict</i> <br>  Any glasses with a yellow filter help prevent dry eyes and irritation with blue light.  Gunnars glasses look beautiful, so they are expensive.  The choice is yours. <br><br>  PS I chose Gunnars because they work and because they look stylish. <br>  PPS Do not forget to give a regular rest to your eyes. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/121852/">https://habr.com/ru/post/121852/</a></p>
