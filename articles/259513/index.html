Skolkovo Startup Village</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/1f9/3a1/21c/1f93a121c3b343d0ba6b3d40b9c61108.jpg"><br><br>  On June 2-3, Intel took part in the <a href="https://startupvillage.ru/ru/">Skolkovo Startup Village</a> conference.  Intel emerged from the startup age a few decades ago, but we know how our energetic and creative young people can use our technology to succeed.  While some worked on the stand, others (in my face) walked around the territory, gathering impressions.  Here they are, these impressions in the format of a photo essay - what is, do not seek it.  Keep in mind: at the end of the post - a small teaser. <br><br>  So, the village of Skolkovo, a Russian forge of the nano-bolt, met guests and participants of the conference with a multi-kilometer traffic jam on a narrow highway that was not adapted to allow so many cars to pass and multimeter lines to the check-in counters: as a result of some kind of failure, whether technical, or organizational, good half of those who arrived had to register again.  Arriving at 9, I stood in the queue for an hour, and as for the late ones who had pulled up according to the Moscow tradition later, they can only sympathize with them ... <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/bdb/1a1/6ed/bdb1a16ed6414351b9e1a2ee2bb92b7e.jpg">

      Entering the village was met by girls and boys dancing on the gate.  The girls squealed and shot with crackers.  For those who consider this work easy, I would like to emphasize that they had to dance all day under the scorching sun.  So and wrinkle long. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/4c4/5c7/659/4c45c7659d3d44658a9f1de71f4ceb76.jpg"><br><br>  Nobel Street, while the only one in the village of startups.  But construction is in full swing, expansion is only a matter of time.  And money.  It seems to me that ours. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/64d/0de/332/64d0de3327c84f599363b1d0010e3499.jpg"><br><br>  Startup LADA presented an innovative car Lada 4x4 Urban.  It looks, of course, not so hot, but nothing, the first step is the first step. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/1f6/ea3/288/1f6ea32883204bb98472879449188193.jpg"><br><br>  Slingshot - a symbol of innovation.  There is another symbol in Skolkovo, well reflecting the essence of what is happening: a bicycle with square wheels is installed at the entrance to the village.  Very accurate in my opinion. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d5a/9ba/1e0/d5a9ba1e05b34701aaaa46d12de40761.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/1e7/f8e/a68/1e7f8ea6858c49b2a2f6ae870f281617.jpg"><br><br>  Intel's pavilion was always crowded.  They demonstrated <a href="https://software.intel.com/ru-ru/realsense/home">RealSense</a> : they played on a virtual piano, and Konstantin <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/cappasity/" class="user_link">cappasity</a> personally produced a <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/intel/blog/250241/">3D scan of</a> various objects.  Also, everyone (or, more precisely, everyone who posted a selfie from here to any social network) was handed out <a href="http://www.dippindots.com.ru/">nano-ice</a> .  In the corner of the photo shows how it looks.  It tastes great! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/231/307/aac/231307aac13d42d4b6a00aa30977678c.jpg"><br><br>  This is a Skolkovo <s>nano</s> robot, infante terribl√© of our pavilion.  At first, he moderately annealed and even quoted Guberman from memory, but then either from the heat or from excessive attention fell into insanity and by the end of the day he got everyone. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/3bc/737/360/3bc73736082c46bab3670ebf9f19b438.jpg"><br><br>  Another ‚Äústart-up‚Äù, it is unclear how it turned out in Startup Village - Russian Post.  Going into the pavilion behind the mailbox, you could take a virtual tour of the ‚Äúoffice of the future.‚Äù  The future of the post, according to the authors of the project, is the introduction of an electronic queue and glass partitions.  Not to say that it is very ambitious, but real and useful. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f2b/ec8/06f/f2bec806ff134b9eaa439ccde3d75d29.jpg"><br><br>  Headliners of the first day of the festival: Deputy Prime Minister of Russia Arkady Dvorkovich and President of the Skolkovo Foundation Viktor Vekselberg.  On the second day, Dmitry Medvedev himself arrived. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/573/9b3/a12/5739b3a12c304674931d47556a8b6f7f.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b11/27f/891/b1127f8910f24d26b2bcef62f47fe1b3.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a4a/34d/6f4/a4a34d6f4c7f4af48dfce51cb6649bfb.jpg"><br><br>  Robot section of the village leaves a sense of inferiority.  Then you realize: well, when a robot decently plays table hockey and a designer with sensors is not bad either, but in the 21st century you expect more intelligent products from innovative start-ups.  Certain hopes were pinned on the computer chess player, but the setup of the system was delayed and we could not see it in the work. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/958/ed8/465/958ed846568c45ca987b4e56df3b6476.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ea7/569/83a/ea756983a6954fef8f86321dd9165431.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f28/424/b05/f28424b05213438fb2ab2b7e4a6457ed.jpg"><br><br>  So that you do not think that I was looking for one negative on Startup Village - no, it is not.  I was pleased to see enthusiastic people who were hotly discussing some working moments, nice to find really useful, not toy projects - there were not many of them, but they were.  My main prize goes to the guys from the company <a href="http://fibrum.com/">Fibrum</a> .  Making a virtual reality helmet from a smartphone is an absolutely brilliant idea in its simplicity.  And the implementation is also not pumped up. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d04/fcf/f7f/d04fcff7fa0b4c718f523212cad92cfd.jpg"><br><br>  Why is this girl engaged in training around the Intel Pavilion?  But I will not say.  At least for now.  I note only that the topic is very interesting and soon a separate post will be devoted to it. <br><br>  So say goodbye.  All successful innovation! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/259513/">https://habr.com/ru/post/259513/</a></p>
