Universal application for iPhone and iPad <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/ru/app/id433870784%3Fmt%3D8">"Proverbs about everything</a> . <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/ru/app/id433870784%3Fmt%3D8">"</a>  And what happened to him, honestly, I did not even expect.  Events somehow developed not at all in such a scenario, as I thought and expected.  Under the cut a lot of information with graphs, statistics and ideas. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  Start. </h4><br>  It all started in 2008 when I released the Proverbs About Everything audio disc.  First of all, this disc was intended for people who are already my clients (I am the owner of a training company). <br>  Part of the disc, about 25 parables, I posted in the public domain on my website and on torrents.  During this period, since 2008.  till 2011  There was a very large number of downloads.  Then I decided to arrange the disc in the form of an application for the iPhone / iPad.  All work took about 2 months. <br>  The designer was found on freelance, the programmer was already tested on my previous application ‚ÄúDISCover‚Äù.  I will not go into the details of programming much, but I will focus on a few points. <br>  Initially, I set the task to make a universal application for the iPhone and iPad.  This solution turned out to be pros and cons. <br>  <b>Pros:</b> <br>  The application comes out simultaneously for both platforms. <br>  Reviews for both platforms in one place. <br>  <b>Minuses:</b> <br>  There is no possibility to track download statistics separately for iPad and iPhone. <br>  If there is an error in the version for one platform, on the other it will also appear in the form of reviews. <br><br><h4>  New chips </h4><br>  In the application itself, I applied a very interesting mechanism that I have never met anywhere, but in this case this solution worked very well.  I called it "conditionally paid." <br>  The conventionally free model provides that the application first has full functionality, and then either part or the entire application is blocked. <br>  In <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/ru/app/id433870784%3Fmt%3D8">the Proverbs About Everything</a> app, the opposite is true.  In the beginning there are some limitations, and after a certain period (10 days) everything becomes available.  And if the user wants to get all the features at once, then he pays for the purchase.  I even wanted to make an instruction in the application itself how to hack it in order to get everything at once, but then somehow I changed my mind. <br>  In addition, I suggested the user to choose the purchase price himself - $ 1.99, $ 4.99, $ 9.99 or $ 19.99.  And for different amounts - the same thing.  The price of intellectual property is always subjective and very much depends on how much the buyer is willing to pay.  Therefore, choice is the key point in such things. <br>  By the way, Apple, with its Mac OS Lion for $ 29.99, made similar code.  The price of one copy of the operating system for the company itself is negligible, but due to the price, a huge audience will be covered. <br>  Here it seemed the most interesting. <br>  There is a popular opinion in runet that Russians break all programs, and if they buy, they are cheaper.  Maybe this opinion is, but in my case it turned out to be somehow not quite so. <br>  80% of purchases, which obviously turned out to be $ 2. <br>  15% for $ 5, <br>  3% for $ 10, <br>  2% for $ 20. <br>  But if you take in terms of money, sales of $ 20 brought about 12% of the profits, which is not very bad.  And sales for $ 2 brought 54% of the profits.  This is data for 3 weeks of sales. <br>  In other words, this model worked.  Of course, it will not work for all software products, but for many it will definitely work. <br>  Plus - it is very positive impact on the image of the application.  This can be illustrated with reviews, which are currently exactly 400 pcs.  Of these, 347 are 5 stars, 31 are 4 stars.  And I confess honestly - only one review of them from me :-) <br>  Also, the number of reviews was affected by the fact that the application has a built-in reminder that you should write a review or rate it.  Statistically, this reminder increased the number of reviews somewhere by 80% from when this reminder was not.  To be more precise, it was, but it was a bug, and the transition to the app on the page to write a review did not occur.  Therefore, I can recommend developers to embed recalls into their application.  Negative feedback, if any, due to some bochin, will definitely be left to you, because people are very purposeful in a fit of anger and irritation.  And the positive reviews often forget to leave, because they believe that a quality application is self-evident.  Remind yourself! <br><br><h4>  Statistics </h4><br>  And on completion I saved the most interesting. <br>  I myself do not understand how this happened, but not a single cent was spent on promotion of this application, and I didn‚Äôt promote it at all.  Here I attach the statistics of appstor ratings. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/4c3/628/8d0/4c36288d07aff2a2155ee5a3c1914292.png" alt="image">  <a href="http://www.appannie.com/433870784/ranking/history/">Link to Appannie statistics</a>

For 2nd place in TOP10 Free you need more than <b>5000</b> per day.  For the Kazakhstan AppStore - more than <b>100</b> downloads per day - this is the 3rd place.  I indicated the number in general, both for the iPad and for the iPhone, because iTunessConnect does not indicate for which device the jump was.  And ratings for the iPad AppStore and for the iPhone AppStore considers separately.  For greater accuracy, I can say that from approx.  <b>120,000</b> launches of the app <b>31,000</b> was done on the ipads. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/aad/2e7/0cf/aad2e70cfff031e46c63b6dde0893988.png" alt="image"><br>  At the time of writing, the total number of races was 61,347. <br><br><h4>  PS </h4><br>  Of course, the application is specific, and initially it was focused only on the Russian app store and the Russian-speaking users of IDEs.  But the fact that the application was about 2 weeks in the TOP10, and continues to be in the top in the Lifestyle section, my attitude towards the Russian appstore has changed a lot. <br><br>  In the next post I will describe the work of Google Analytics for iOS applications, and what pitfalls have arisen. <br><br><h4>  Pps </h4><br>  I almost forgot.  At the moment, the application has already fully paid off and has already brought quite a substantial profit.  Direct creation costs are about $ 1000. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/124653/">https://habr.com/ru/post/124653/</a></p>
