    <h4>  And you need it? </h4><br>  What is dedicated (hereinafter - "Dedic")?  This is the server that you rent from the data center.  The key difference from shared hosting (shared) and virtual servers (VDS \ VPS) is that for the period of the lease it is your server.  You can do whatever you want with it - change the OS, set of software, place other clients on it under the terms of shared \ VPS ... <br><br>  Dedicated is worth going if: <br><br><ul><li>  You do not have enough resources virtual hosting \ server. </li><li>  You have a large project, and you can not place it at ordinary hosters. </li><li>  You want to resell server resources (become a hoster). </li><li>  You are afraid for the safety of your information or for its secrets. </li></ul><br><br><h4>  What you need to know? </h4><br>  In order to choose the right server you need to know a few things: <br><br><ul><li>  The necessary hardware, based on the load of your project. </li><li>  Traffic consumption </li><li>  Country of placement. </li></ul><br><br>  Many webmasters like to measure the load in "hits per day" or "unik per day."  This is a spherical horse in a vacuum.  For every hit, you may have a page-bookmark weighing 10kb, or maybe a complex script, with a dozen database queries.  Hoster your "hits and unique" will not say anything. <br><br>  The load on the iron is measured in the consumption of RAM, disk space, I \ O and CPU time. <br>  The load on the Internet channel is measured in megabits per second. <br><br>  With regard to the country of placement - in general, you need to choose a DC (data center) in the country from which there will be the majority of visitors.  Exceptions (such as differences in the laws of different countries) are beyond the scope of this article.  Ie, if 80% of your visitors are from Russia and the CIS, it‚Äôs stupid to host a server in Australia. <br><br><h4>  Choose a datacenter. </h4><br>  From the data center is required to organize the maximum uptime (uptime) of your server. <br>  This concept includes: <br><br><ul><li>  Power supply </li><li>  Conditioning. </li><li>  Channels of access to the network. </li><li>  The quality of the server itself (more on this in the section on choosing a configuration). </li></ul><br><br>  Be sure to ask if the DC has its own diesel generator and a sufficient number of UPS. <br>  Channels - here the principle of "much does not happen."  I would not trust the DC, which has 1 uplink, even reliable.  Anything can happen, sometimes even very respected ISPs ‚Äúfall‚Äù. <br>  Plus, the datacenter is connected with traffic exchange points (MSK-IX, etc.), because  Such traffic is often not traced / charged at a more favorable rate for ISP users included in these points. <br>  Also, the DC has a number of independent main channels.  When a DC is ‚Äútied‚Äù to one telecom operator, this is bad. <br><br>  A prerequisite is technical support.  Ideally - around the clock.  Be sure to clarify this question, read in the contract "the maximum response time of the TP", often there is a funny content, ala "72 hours." <br><br>  Remote power control services and the ability to connect KVMOIP (keyboard-video-mouse over IP) are highly desirable.  The first will give you the opportunity to enable / disable / restart your server without jerking those.  support, the second - the possibility of self-BIOS settings, installing the operating system and restoring the server even with the most severe failures (‚ÄúOS does not load, network disappears‚Äù, etc.).  As a rule, KVM is provided for a fee, but charging for RPC is a bad form. <br><br>  Check with the DC about the possibility of concluding an SLA, if you are interested. <br><br>  An important aspect is the ability to scale the infrastructure as your project grows.  If the DC channels are 95% loaded, and there are 3 places left in the racks - maybe you should look for another one? <br><br>  Well, personal advice from me - never mess with resellers, sub-resellers, sub-sub-sub-resellers.  It is very difficult to find the ends of such a chain if one day your server stops responding, along with the telephone of such a ‚Äúsub-sub-sub‚Äù.  Work directly with the DC or, if it does not have a dedicated service, with the first level hosters.  Check with the host about the availability of a license for telematic communication services and delivered to CSS. <br><br><h4>  The choice of the "iron" part and traffic. </h4><br>  When choosing hardware for your project, consider the following things: <br><br>  1) Other things being equal - brandname-server is preferable to self-assembled (yes, it happens). <br>  2) Often, when using shared \ VDS, the hoster does not include in your consumption the resources necessary to ensure the operation of the server itself and your website, such as DNS, Mail, FTP, and firewall. <br>  3) Never rent a server, which you have enough "in the butt".  The load can increase dramatically, for example, when a competitor project is closed, but moving to another server is not five minutes.  Take "for growth", it is better to overpay $ 15 a month for the extra 512MB of memory than frantically search for a new server when your site starts to ‚Äúbend‚Äù. <br>  4) Consider the possibility that your server might be attacked.  Leave stock on resources. <br><br>  Almost all operators charge the installation fee for the server - in the amount of 1 monthly payment.  But there are promotions and special offers of ‚Äúburning‚Äù servers when there is no installation fee. <br><br>  Traffic: <br><br>  0) There is no limitless,% username%.  If you are promised "unlimited" traffic, then either they clamp down on the bandwidth, or at really large volumes they will be "asked" from DCs out.  In any case, I did not see any exceptions. <br>  1) Clearly calculate how much traffic your server consumes.  Often, it is much more profitable to ‚Äúprepay‚Äù traffic for a month than to buy it again after a limit has been made. <br>  2) If you do not want to pay on the fact, you have two ways: <br><br><ul><li>  "Conditionally unlimited" traffic.  T.N.  "Traffic by ratios".  You will be required to comply with the ratio of Russian to foreign and incoming to outgoing.  Calculate whether you fit into these ratios - overspending, as a rule, is expensive. </li><li>  ‚ÄúShared‚Äù - the provision of a certain bandwidth to multiple servers.  Than it is dangerous, I think, so it is clear. </li><li>  ‚ÄúBuying a band‚Äù is the most expensive, but the ‚Äúbest‚Äù option is that you pay for bandwidth and don‚Äôt pay for traffic.  A 100MBps band can cost up to 100,000 rubles, and not every data center is also ready to provide large bands. </li></ul><br><br>  I hope I have described all the possible questions that a beginner may have.  I didn‚Äôt deliberately go into the ‚Äújungle‚Äù - I avoided the questions of SLA, server reselling, etc. This is not the purpose of this article. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/50787/">https://habr.com/ru/post/50787/</a></p>
