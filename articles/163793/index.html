In Russia, they rarely produce independently, preferring to sell finished products.  The process of self-assembly of imported components can be called production, and if so, this review will be devoted to the Russian production Ultra MicroXperts MXP U400-02.  Instead of a boring story about a stylish white cardboard box in which an ultrabook is packed, I‚Äôll tell a little about the manufacturer.  The MicroXperts trademark has been on the market for 25 years.  Initially, it was registered in the United States and in 1993, one of the first assembly plants in Russia was opened in St. Petersburg.  In the 90s, MicroXperts personal computers were sold in the largest stores in the Northern Capital.  Many large government and commercial institutions were corporate brand customers.  The story is silent about the reasons for the decline in the company's activities, but a new round of development began in 2009 after the brand was acquired by Ulmart.  A wide range of computers produced recently replenished with portable devices, which will be discussed. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  I will begin, perhaps, with the technical characteristics. <br><table><tbody><tr><td>  CPU </td><td>  Intel Core i5 3217U (1.8 GHz), 2 cores, L3 3 MB cache, NT, <br>  TDP 17 W </td></tr><tr><td>  Chipset </td><td>  Intel HM76 Express </td></tr><tr><td>  RAM </td><td>  8 GB DDR3 1333 MHz in single-channel mode (one 8 GB band) </td></tr><tr><td>  Video card </td><td>  Intel HD Graphics 4000, core frequency dynamically <br>  varies from 350 MHz to 1150 MHz <br></td></tr><tr><td>  Network devices </td><td>  Wi-Fi 802.11 b / g / n, Bluetooth, <br>  Gigabit ethernet </td></tr><tr><td>  Storage System </td><td>  SSD: Intel SATA III 120 <br>  Gb </td></tr><tr><td>  Integrated devices </td><td>  1.3 MP webcam, microphone </td></tr><tr><td>  Ports for connecting devices </td><td>  Two USB 2.0 ports, one USB 3.0 port, one HDMI port, <br>  one <br>  combo audio jack (headphone and microphone), one gigabit port <br>  Ethernet one <br>  VGA port, 1 SDXC / SDHC / SD / MMC card reader </td></tr><tr><td>  Display </td><td>  14.0 ‚Äù, resolution 1366 * 768 </td></tr><tr><td>  Battery </td><td>  6-section, Li-Ion, 7800 mAh </td></tr><tr><td>  Weight </td><td>  1.76 kg <br></td></tr></tbody></table><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/b0a/5dc/7dd/b0a5dc7dded728abb40cf5e0cc678a8a.jpg"><br>  Externally, the ultrabook is not a cast, rather even strict, because it is made entirely in black.  The design is non-unique, the platform is made by Lengda and is called X300V.  The diagonal of the monitor is 14 inches.

    <img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/734/5db/c91/7345dbc91e9f8219ea216dbbc4f75d54.jpg"><br><br>  The top cover, or surface A, is made of aluminum.  Right in the middle, the MXP logo is applied on it using laser engraving. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/2cd/77b/574/2cd77b574f41388180080856d69b6bcd.jpg"><br><br>  Keyboard island type, the backlight is missing, the keys are quite convenient.  It is worth noting the full-sized cursor keys, as habrayuders often in the comments complain about the small size of the cursor buttons.  Russian and English letters are applied in one color - white.  It‚Äôs hard to say whether it‚Äôs a plus or a minus, because the MacBook also has one color of letters.  The movement of the buttons is soft, but pressing is clearly audible. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/c83/cc1/166/c83cc116657fb8eda7e0eeb5b1623d91.jpg"><br><br>  The following ports and connectors are located on the right side of the ultrabook: combo audio, USB 3.0, HDMI, LAN, power adapter jack.  The LAN port is closed with a rubber plug, a slightly strange decision, because the ultrabook does not claim to be ‚Äúprotected‚Äù and the rest of the connectors are not covered by anything. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/ec1/f56/863/ec1f56863e18ffbeaaa7fc227843283f.jpg"><br><br>  The left side of the MicroXperts MXP U400 ultrabook contains a VGA connector, two USB 2.0 ports and a card reader that can read SD / SDHC / MMC <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/f03/cd5/6d9/f03cd56d9bf84a17f7c1bca1f8644349.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/083/5be/64e/0835be64e7ca24609a2caddf9ad95f17.jpg"><br><br>  The back side is reserved for the ventilation holes through which the cooling system ejects hot air. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/c38/a6b/3de/c38a6b3de4926b70eb023dcf4bf1fe32.jpg"><br><br>  The bottom side of the ultrabook is made of a single piece of plastic, and just get to the inside will not work.  In total, the cover is fixed with 18 (!) Screws of different lengths.  When assembling / disassembling, it is very important not to confuse them in places, otherwise the plastic of the surface C, the one where the keyboard is located, can swell significantly. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/d94/137/fbe/d94137fbeb0e3cfb1c266fc54dc3a92a.jpg"><br><br>  Package delivery is very modest: user manual and charger.  Nishtyak lovers do not profit from anything, but on the price of the product is not reflected. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/56c/7c8/d0f/56c7c8d0ff82b29ba3c65ef9923e9262.jpg"><br><br>  The power supply is not perfect in terms of dimensions, but it is already close to the best samples. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/bf4/e8c/860/bf4e8c8605bd8204cc29f2e131d429b4.jpg"><br><br>  We dig inside.  A good half of the insides is occupied by the battery.  This fact gives hope for good battery life. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/1ae/1e8/df5/1ae1e8df5ffbcb965dc92de94a8b9077.jpg"><br><br>  The system has an SSD disk from Intel.  No compromises and hybrid storage systems, just pure performance. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/87a/940/24e/87a94024e7219373e5efb40f47759ded.jpg"><br><br>  The battery capacity is 7800 mAh.  Another hint of "vitality." <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/fcc/8e8/4ec/fcc8e84ec9f0bfeb9f7a6fc0c0961a64.jpg"><br><br>  The front panel is studded with LEDs like a Christmas tree.  Here and the power indicator, and the hard drive activity indicator, and the charge indicator, and Caps Lock, and NumLock, and even the wireless activity indicator. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/f47/a40/6a3/f47a406a3fa5da823d78763cd80ff9a1.jpg"><br>  The cooling system consists of a heat pipe, uniform for the chipset and processor, and a fan manufactured by SEPA.  This is where the minus lies - at high revs, read when the CPU is loaded, the roar of the fan becomes very noticeable. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/cfe/068/82c/cfe06882caedf9209c623a5a870dbfc8.jpg"><br>  An 8-gigabyte DDR3 memory module is installed in the only allocated slot on the motherboard.  I'm not sure if it makes sense to install more than 8 gigabytes of RAM into a laptop, but with the advent of 16 gigabyte slats, the owners of MicroXperts MXP U400 will have a chance to try to double the memory. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/997/c11/a9d/997c11a9d6860af91b7c44e54a0f5b04.jpg"><br><br>  We climbed inside, collected, now we will check the knowledge obtained visually with the help of software. <br>  The Intel Core i5-3317U processor belonging to the Ivy Bridge family, is capable of operating at frequencies up to 2.6 GHz in TurboBoost mode.  The maximum heat dissipation is - 17 watts. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/b54/71f/cdc/b5471fcdc29ccf8707c3e17dfebf739d.png"><br>  The chipset on which the motherboard is built - Intel HM76, has a maximum heat dissipation of 4.1 W, that is, in general, the system emits 21.1 W of heat, a very modest figure, but not minimal. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/2fb/9d3/bad/2fb9d3bad0d57a35290cd4b4bc7f696a.png"><br><br>  Intel's SSD drive operates in SATA II mode, the presence of a hidden R drive: allows you to talk about the pre-installed system for restoring Windows. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/092/092/5ad/0920925ade3fb9284540c4ab1eea643c.png"><br><br>  The graphics core of Intel HD Graphics 4000 is well known, as it is found in all ultrabooks with integrated video. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/f30/0ac/8e1/f300ac8e1bfc658acbb371e0a933a5dc.png"><br><br>  Integrated screenshot with MicroXperts MXP U400 features. <br><br>  Well, let's go test it, what is there in terms of performance? <br>  The standard test of Windows 7 says that the worst thing about the ultrabook is the situation with graphics and gives a rating of 4.7.  Recall that it was on other ultrabooks: Toshiba Portege - 5.2, ASUS ZenBook UX31A - 5.9, Acer Aspire M3 -5.7, Samsung 900X3A - 4.7, Sony T13 - 4.5, HP Folio 13 - 4.7.  All ultrabooks with a rating lower than 5.0 have a single-channel memory mode, which adversely affects the performance of integrated graphics. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/b0b/1b6/f60/b0b1b6f603c0b0266e3149060fdc447d.png"><br><br>  But actually the confirmation of the above, only 10060 MB / s when reading from memory, the ‚Äútwo-channel‚Äù ASUS ZenBook has a similar indicator of almost 17000. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/4e1/faf/21d/4e1faf21dcd9140afb2d6a9eef6bc502.png"><br><br>  Solid-state drive shows good numbers, but not the maximum due to the fact that it does not work in SATA III mode (a constructive feature of the platform). <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/0d4/f61/d93/0d4f61d93a751579cb47a0020323f1c7.png"><br><br>  I‚Äôll continue to test complex performance with the PC Mark Vantage and PC Mark 7 tests. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/6fa/2e8/c54/6fa2e8c54539596402df3d71bccea6a9.png"><br><br>  Due to the high performance of the storage system, in these tests the MicroXperts MXP U400 is ahead of the model even with external graphics, but with hybrid storage.  There is only ASUS ZenBook on high-speed SSD SanDisk and ADATA. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/7e7/34b/f32/7e734bf32680fc2ac3b7f4e56d962bca.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/13c/be4/158/13cbe41585e79288f186b197dd24621b.png"><br><br>  The temperature mode is not the strongest place, not only is the fan noisy, so also the processor heats up.  82 degrees - such a maximum figure was recorded in the process of passing tests. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/31b/ecc/8c3/31becc8c3317cd177415e801ff02954d.png"><br>  And here is the sweet: the duration of battery life by PowerMark is 3 hours 39 minutes.  More than just the Acer Aspire M3 Ultra and HP Folio 13. Excellent results. <br><br>  Final thoughts, or instead of a conclusion. <br>  First, this ultrabook has a significant advantage - the price.  In Yulmart you can get such a device for <a href="http://www.ulmart.ru/goods/384004/">26,090 rubles</a> with Windows 8, <a href="http://www.ulmart.ru/goods/374244/">26,490 rubles</a> with Windows 7 HP and a slightly simpler version with 4 gigabytes of memory for 25,990 <a href="http://www.ulmart.ru/goods/374249/">rubles</a> .  Secondly, the unique feature is a 3-year warranty, even Sony and ASUS do not have this, not to mention Apple and HP.  Thirdly, the domestic manufacturer, for someone a dubious moment, and someone will be pleased to work on the Russian ultrabook.  Yes, the device turned out to be not without flaws, but according to insider information, there will soon be new ultrabooks from MicroXperts, in which I hope the minuses will be completely absent. <br><br>  Ps.  Many people are rooting for Russia at Eurovision, on the football fields and hockey rinks. Let's also support Russian companies that are trying to do more than just resell. <br></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/163793/">https://habr.com/ru/post/163793/</a></p>
