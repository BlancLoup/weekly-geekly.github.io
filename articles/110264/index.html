No, let me reformulate.  I want to substantiate the existence of such a problem, and then give a solution.  I think we can change a lot. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/1a45723c/c5aa9870/9cd491e9/5a6afe15.png"><br><br><a name="habracut"></a>

    <h4>  Two Postulates </h4><br>  1. <b>Education =&gt; Specialists</b> <br>  If training was conducted taking into account the areas necessary for production, it would be good. <br><br>  2. <b>Specialists =&gt; Powerful Economy</b> <br>  In fact, the presence of a competent person in the right place is what, in my opinion, we really miss.  Sometimes you listen to what people do at the enterprises, and you wonder. <br><br><h4>  What is the problem? </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/56731d10/9e461023/2398eb3d/1c0b3781.png"><br>  The fact that VKontakte sit more interesting than learning.  Playing WoW is also more interesting.  Of course, there are ways and self-study, but when a student has a choice: play or think, how would he learn what he chooses? <br><br>  Thus, the application of new technologies is a key aspect of improving the quality of education.  But here, of course, mindless purchasing Macs for schools will not help, you need to follow some additional considerations. <br><br><h4>  What to do </h4><br><ol><li>  Use as a base Internet sites. <br><ol><li>  Programs for different subjects can be from different manufacturers, providing competition and fullness of content. </li><li>  Sites, of course, should work on a wide range of ‚Äúhardware‚Äù and browsers, not including IE6 (I saw only in one school out of 20 where I was). </li><li>  The site for the site is wrong.  It is necessary to use the possibilities online, and not copy the paper versions. </li><li>  Information needs to be constantly updated so that it is relevant.  It is cheaper than reprinting textbooks (oops, publishers will not like it). </li><li>  All sites must be combined with some elements. <br><ol><li>  Perhaps a single portal where schools / universities / others can choose the desired software and compare. </li><li>  A single API for obtaining performance information so that the Journal application can collect statistics from everything that is used. </li><li>  The same logins and passwords must be used to log into any systems. * </li><li>  Need some guidelines for building an interface, like mobile platforms. </li></ol></li></ol></li><li>  Use modern teaching methods.  Speech about "computerized active learning."  Below is an example of a simplified method of operation. <br><ol><li>  The teacher gives a theoretical introduction of the lesson.  An abstract of the material is available in the system. </li><li>  The teacher launches a game for students that allows you to practically master the subject.  Suitable for Russian, mathematics, physics, chemistry, economics, history, ... </li><li>  The interactive test, along with the success in the game, allows you to sum up the results. </li><li>  The main effect is the highest motivation to learn. </li></ol></li><li>  The introduction of all programs must be initiated by a teacher who wants to work with it.  Promises from above will not give effect.  Above can only learning and explanation go. </li></ol><br>  * I stress once again the importance of the fact that the training systems are represented by different manufacturers, but in a certain unified space. <br><br>  Additionally, I note that it is cheaper to give out a netbook to every student in Russia than to reprint textbooks 1-2 times.  Unfortunately, at the moment such a decision would mean that Russian producers of books and office supplies are losing orders, and foreign manufacturers of netbooks will receive them. <br><br><h4>  Conclusion </h4><br>  It would be very interesting to hear comments on this list and jointly supplement it.  In the future, I am going to highlight certain points in more detail from the perspective of the experience of introducing such educational processes in Moscow schools.  Of course, 1-2 topics will get into ‚ÄúI am promoting‚Äù, but I think that we should not wait until the state or someone starts teaching us children in a new way, they are ready, if they knew how.  We must tell and show them. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/110264/">https://habr.com/ru/post/110264/</a></p>
