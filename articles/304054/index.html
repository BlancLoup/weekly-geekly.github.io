When automating production companies, this product often turns out to be the optimal solution, and more than once I have been involved in the implementation of 1C UPP for different organizations. <br><br>  In the process, I noticed that there are practically no reviews of this software.  There are technical documentation, some tips for programmers to solve specific problems in this system, training courses.  But for users of some clear description of the entire system is not.  And very often, before introducing this software, I have to explain the features, advantages and disadvantages of the ‚ÄúOffice of Manufacturing Enterprises‚Äù practically ‚Äúon the fingers‚Äù. <br><br>  Even on Habr√© in the ERP section, information about this system has not yet been available.  I decided to fill this gap.  In addition, I hope that my article will help entrepreneurs and IT-specialists at the stage of choosing software for automating an industrial enterprise and prepare them for the features that need to be taken into account when implementing this system.

      In this review, I want to tell you what the UPP Ed.  1.3, so that whoever decides to buy and implement it, is more aware and more consciously approached the choice of this expensive product.  I will try to give an objective assessment of the system, based on my experience working with it and the experience of my clients.  This review will help someone make a positive decision regarding the purchase of the program, and someone - the decision to abandon it. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  In order to understand the features of the software, you need to answer the following questions: <br><br><ol><li>  What is the system, what tasks it poses. </li><li>  How this system is able to perform the tasks. </li><li>  Identify the pros and cons of the system. </li></ol><br>  The first thing that is very important to understand: 1C.  Management of a manufacturing enterprise is not just an accounting system, while its development took into account modern methods of enterprise management, and therefore this product is proposed for use, including as an ERP system.  Further, from the name it follows that this particular product is intended for the work of enterprises of industrial type.  From this point of view, I intend to consider the software product 1C UPP. <br><br><h4>  <b>What is an ERP system?</b> </h4><br><blockquote>  The ERP system (Enterprise Resource Planning) is a corporate information system that is designed to control, record and analyze all types of business processes and solve business problems across an enterprise. </blockquote><br>  Simply put, the ERP-system combines all types of accounting that are present in the company.  With the use of ERP-systems, information is exchanged and interaction takes place between different departments, etc.  In the case of an ERP-system ‚ÄúProduction Enterprise Management‚Äù, the software product offers the implementation of all these functions for a production company. <br><br>  When implementing the product ‚ÄúManagement of a manufacturing enterprise‚Äù, the developers tried to combine the maximum possible list of functions in the system.  If you look at the documents, you can count as many as 15 subsystems.  The fact is that in 1C documents are grouped by subsystems: <br><br><ul><li>  Production Management </li><li>  Cost management </li><li>  Procurement Management </li><li>  Planning </li><li>  IFRS </li><li>  Tax and accounting </li><li>  Wage </li><li>  Personnel records, etc. </li></ul><br>  Those.  In this system, we tried to include all the functions that may be required for the operation of a manufacturing enterprise.  This is exactly how 1C is positioning its ERP system: here you already have everything you need to automate any processes without using other software products. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/408/e0e/662/408e0e66247c41f3852882b802d38e68.jpg"><br>  The screenshot I made clearly shows that very few documents are directly related to production.  All other documents are additional subsystems designed to make ‚ÄúProduction Enterprise Management‚Äù a universal solution for all departments.  I do not see the point of examining in detail all these possibilities, but it is important that each of the subsystems work efficiently and fully and can solve the needs of a particular business.  In this article we will focus in detail on the block that distinguishes the SCP from other solutions 1c - Production Management. <br><br><h4>  <b>1C SCP: product details</b> </h4><br>  The company 1C is positioning "Manufacturing Enterprise Management" as one of the flagship products.  This is a typical configuration from 1C, i.e.  the software product is fully produced by the 1C company itself, and any modifications in the system should be made by the official 1C partners.  SCP is one of the configurations that is constantly supported by 1C, updates are released to it, etc. <br><br>  For this typical configuration, many modified, so-called industry versions have been created: 1C. Machine-building, 1C. Meat-packing plant, 1C. Furniture production, 1C. Polygraphy, etc. <br><br>  Industry solutions are created by 1C partner companies based on the basic configuration.  This usually happens in the following way: for a specific customer, modifications are made, after which a new version is ‚Äúassembled‚Äù for them, intended for the chosen industry.  The modified configuration is called for the industry for which it was written, and is sold as a ‚Äúboxed solution‚Äù. <br><br><h4>  <b>Product cost</b> </h4><br>  In order to work with this configuration, you must purchase the product itself.  The recommended price from 1C is 186,000 rubles.  And the licensing of this software is made on a common basis for 1C, i.e.  Users of other 1C products may not buy any separate licenses for this system. <br><br><blockquote>  Any license, for example, from 1C Accounting or from 1C Trade and warehouse, will fit this system.  Naturally, the cost of licenses for these products is the same. </blockquote><br>  It is important to understand that industry solutions from 1C partner companies may require their own separate licenses.  And here the price may differ from the basic version. <br><br>  As with other products, licensing is performed according to one of the options adopted in 1C: for a computer (device) and for a user (connecting from any device).  Here I will not dwell in detail, since all the information is on the 1C website.  You can get acquainted with it at the link: <a href="http://v8.1c.ru/enterprise/">http://v8.1c.ru/enterprise/</a> <br><br>  Much has been written about the 1C program itself.  I also wrote about this platform, for example, in the article ‚Äú <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/trinion/blog/244727/">Why 1C is bad and why 1C programmers do not like it so much</a> ‚Äù.  Taking into account the fact that the system "Management of a manufacturing enterprise" operates on the basis of 1C.  Enterprises 8.3, all the advantages and disadvantages of the basic software are also present in it. <br><br><h4>  <b>Consider the configuration details</b> </h4><br>  In the book ‚ÄúProduction and Operational Management‚Äù R. B. Chase, F. R. Jacobs, N. J. Aquilano, I liked the list of tasks that are put in front of ERP systems for a production enterprise: <br><br><ol><li>  Keep records of new orders and promptly inform them about the production unit. </li><li>  Provide an opportunity for the sales department to see at any time the status of a customer‚Äôs order. </li><li>  Provide the procurement department at any time with the opportunity to see the need for production in materials. </li><li>  Timely provide the state with data on the company's work, i.e.  keep accounting and tax records. </li></ol><br>  Let's take each of these points in more detail.  For clarity, as an example, I will cite one of my clients - a sewing enterprise that uses a SCP system and is a classic and illustrative production model.  This company has many different departments: design, design, production, department of storage of fabrics and accessories, department of storage of finished products, department of management. <br><br><h4>  <b>Accounting for new orders in the sales department</b> </h4><br>  Order accounting is an integral part of the work of any sales (sales) department.  Any order consists of several parts: <br><br><ol><li>  Accounting clients (who sells); </li><li>  Accounting for goods (which will be sold to the client). </li></ol><br>  Buyers (clients) are entered into the Counterparty directory.  Clients can be both individuals and legal.  In the counterparty card, you can specify all the bank details of the company, phone numbers, shipping address and other information necessary for paperwork and the sale. <br><br>  And detailed information about all goods that can be sold is stored in the Nomenclature reference book. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a7d/dcd/e3b/a7ddcde3b1634d5a9b7c867f4fb23110.jpg"><br>  The nomenclature is a directory that is intended to store information about goods and services that can be provided to the buyer.  And in this system, the nomenclature is one of the most complex reference books. <br><br>  Here can be stored: <br><br><ul><li>  Product Name </li><li>  Series </li><li>  Prices </li><li>  Photo </li><li>  Technical Documentation Files </li><li>  Description and almost any other information about the product. </li></ul><br>  Using these directories, a sales employee creates a Sales Order document, where he specifies the contractor and a list of prices with the item list. <br><br>  For example, sewing production work on the order is divided into the following steps: <br><br><ol><li>  Take the order and fix the customer's need. </li><li>  If necessary, purchase a material for the order. </li><li>  To produce cutting, and then tailoring products. </li><li>  To inspect (quality control) of goods. </li><li>  Transfer finished products to the warehouse. </li><li>  Shipment or delivery to the buyer. </li></ol><br>  So, the first stage of the work has been carried out: a document has been created Customer‚Äôs order, which reflects the client‚Äôs data and the goods he needs.  Now you need to transfer information to the production. <br><br><h4>  <b>Alert production of new orders</b> </h4><br>  Production must see new orders as soon as they arrive.  This task configuration 1C UPP, in general, cope.  But there is a counter task: the production should see only those orders that need to be made.  Those.  If the order document indicates the goods that are already in stock, the production of such an order is not interesting, and its appearance in the list of documents available for production may add confusion. <br><br><blockquote>  Production must see orders immediately after they arrive, but only that part of the orders for which products must be produced. </blockquote><br>  In order to avoid such problems, 1C developers propose the following solution: based on the Buyer's Order, the sales manager must create a new document, the Production Order, which will list the items to be produced. <br><br>  But this option can not be called very convenient, as there is one more step in the work, completely dependent on the human factor.  Those.  after creating an order, the manager may forget to create a production order, make a mistake, and so on.  As a result, the necessary goods will not be promptly delivered to the production plan, and the customer will not receive the ordered products on time.  Naturally, with full automation of the enterprise, such situations are unacceptable.  On the other hand, this problem is completely solved by creating additional processing. <br><br>  For the sewing enterprise, we have created the following solution.  An additional plugin was written, which creates an order for production automatically, based on a specific list of different conditions. <br><br>  This processing determined whether the desired items are in stock.  If not, then the next step was the analysis of free products in production.  If there are no such products or they are scheduled for a date later than specified in the order, an order for production is automatically generated. <br><br>  <b>Conclusion:</b> the system has everything you need to store information about products and customers.  It is possible to create an order and transfer it to production.  But to fully automate the work, it will still require revision to the needs of a particular enterprise. <br><br><h4>  <b>Order status in production</b> </h4><br>  As already mentioned, after the order has entered production, it is necessary to ensure that the sales department is able to observe the status of the order in real time.  It is important for the sales manager to know at what stage the work is: whether the ordered product has already entered the work, when it is planned to be completed, etc. <br><br>  This is implemented in one of two ways: <br><br><ol><li>  The sales manager can keep track of what technological stage the work on the order is at: planned, enrolled, quality control, etc.  Thus, the sales specialist can constantly monitor the work on each of the orders and notify the client about the deadlines. </li><li>  For the goods set the deadline for implementation, i.  the date when the list of the required item will be made, will be checked and will be ready for shipment. </li></ol><br>  To implement the first version of the necessary tools in the system is not provided.  Reports that are available reflect only the status of orders and goods in stock.  For the production, if necessary, to implement a phased notification, improvements will be needed. <br>  Unfortunately, in the second case there are no ready-made tools for cases where production can change the date of the order.  Some changes in the date of shipment can be made only by the sales department, and upwards.  Usually the manager can postpone the shipment to a later date, but it will be necessary to notify about the possibility of changing the terms for creating the goods manually.  Also, the production, if necessary, cannot postpone the date of shipment, even if it became possible to execute the order faster. <br><br><blockquote>  In the basic configuration, any changes to the deadlines and the definition of the order fulfillment stage are performed by employees manually, as a result, an unpredictable human factor is included in the work.  But here the improvements will help resolve the issue. </blockquote><br>  So, for sewing production, we created a summary report, which showed: which consignment of goods (from which orders) is in production, including, from the report, which batch is shown in cutting, which - in sewing and so on.  Those.  we divided production processes into stages, and the report displayed a general picture - which products from which orders at which production stages are located, which are in the queue (with the date of commencement of work), which are in quality control, and which are sent to the warehouse. <br><br>  Initially, this report was created for production workers so that they could control their work and make adjustments if necessary.  But in the future, we also opened the same report to the sales department, so that managers could also see the status of this or that order. <br><br>  <b>Conclusion:</b> the configuration does not provide automatic data exchange between the sales department and production after the transfer of the order to work.  But it is possible to implement such solutions based on this configuration by creating additional reports and processing. <br><br><h4>  <b>Connection of production and purchasing department</b> </h4><br>  A very important point - ensuring the production of the necessary materials.  At the same time, in order to work correctly, it is necessary to ensure production with all the necessary to fulfill orders and create goods for free sale from the warehouse, and on the other hand, it is necessary that excess materials do not accumulate in the warehouse.  Therefore, the supply department should have access to up-to-date information on the amount of materials in the warehouse and current production needs, including a list of materials for orders that are only planned for production. <br><br>  How should this work happen: <br><br><ol><li>  A list of needs is formed. </li><li>  Based on this list and product specifications, a list of materials necessary for the production of products is formed. </li><li>  Based on the received list, a procurement plan is formed. </li><li>  In accordance with the procurement plan, the system forms orders to suppliers. </li></ol><br>  <b>An important flaw in the system:</b> the purchasing department is not able to see which materials, from which suppliers and at what prices to purchase.  Those.  The reports only show the general current needs of production, and for more detailed information it is necessary to make additional modifications. <br>  The system has a document called Procurement Plan.  It collects information about needs, i.e.  about what needs to be purchased to ensure production and in what quantity, as it should be in the classical MRP system. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/6aa/0e8/0db/6aa0e80db9f543bb8d82642747dfc45b.jpg"><br>  <b>MRP (Material Requirements Planning)</b> is an automated planning of the enterprise‚Äôs needs for raw materials and materials for production.  Planning is based on specifications. <br><br>  <b>The specification (Bill of Material)</b> is a directory that describes all the parameters of a particular material, its quality, features, tolerances.  For the finished product or ‚Äúsemi-finished product‚Äù, the specification indicates what the product consists of. <br><br>  For the production of each product requires certain materials and semi-finished products.  Materials can be ordered immediately, based on specifications.  For semifinished products, it is necessary to take the next step - to figure out which materials, in turn, this or that semi-finished product consists of.  And also add the necessary materials to the order. <br><br>  Thus, each finished product is automatically divided into materials using several steps.  For example: <br><br><blockquote>  The costume consists of trousers, jacket and package (package).  Trousers and jacket - semi-finished products that need to be decomposed in the next step, to create a package material can be immediately added to purchases.  At the second step, the pants are ‚Äúdivided‚Äù into different types of fabric, thread, zipper, buttons.  Similarly, a jacket also consists of different types of fabric, threads and buttons.  All these materials are added to the procurement plan. </blockquote><br>  Now you can proceed to the selection of a supplier for each of the materials and create an order.  All the above steps in the UPP system are not automated, and therefore, to solve the problem, some refinement will be required.  In this configuration provides the ability to store all needs, there is also an opportunity to collect information on procurement.  But in the base case, they all require human participation, which reduces the level of convenience and reliability.  Therefore, external processing is also very useful here, especially since all the data and access to it are available in the system. <br><br>  For sewing production, we solved the question as follows.  On the basis of the report developed for production, as well as information about orders, the need for the necessary materials was automatically calculated.  Further, materials stored in the warehouse were deducted from this list, and a report was created with which it was possible to make purchases.  Next, the suppliers report how quickly they can deliver the materials.  And manually, this information is entered into the system, on the basis of which sellers will be able to notify customers about the timing of order production. <br><br><h4>  <b>Accounting and tax reporting in the "box solution"</b> </h4><br>  The typical configuration of ‚ÄúProduction Management‚Äù, according to the developers, should collect all the necessary information for the accounting and tax reporting and create all the reporting required for the work of the accounting department. <br>  And here this configuration has a very large ‚ÄúAchilles heel‚Äù.  The fact is that in each document there are three checkboxes: <br><br><ul><li>  CU - pass a document on management accounting; </li><li>  BU - the document passes through accounting; </li><li>  WELL - the document is on tax accounting. </li></ul><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/9cf/cde/ba8/9cfcdeba8c854a95af6e706b4c35efb1.jpg"><br>  Since the documents are not divided according to different systems, the human factor comes into force.  For example, an employee of the purchasing department or storekeeper, after receiving the materials, holds the receipt document.  The material enters the account.  But if at the same time he did not put a ‚Äútick‚Äù on the CU, then the accountant does not see the document, and he himself holds the receipt invoice on the basis of the tax invoice received to him.  As a result, the document is corrected twice by different authors.  And in case of any errors, it will be very difficult to identify the culprit. <br><br>  How this problem is solved in different cases, I do not know.  So far I have come across options where management agreed with this flaw and preferred to rely on employees.  The only method of protection against the human factor that has been implemented is to set checkboxes by default.  In principle, in small and medium business, with which I usually work, this is really enough. <br><br><h4>  <b>Integration with other software products and systems</b> </h4><br>  Integration is an important step that is necessary in the automation of the work of any company, including production.  At the same time, it is necessary to understand that integration is an expensive process that takes a significant amount of time and effort.  Since we are talking about a complex multi-functional ERP-system, then for high-quality process automation you will need to obtain a large number of diverse data from different sources. <br><br>  If you look from the point of view of production, you will definitely need to upload data on the dates of production, semi-finished products and materials into the system.  The purchasing department loads bills of lading and other receipt documents into the system.  Sales must upload order information and so on.  In addition, various situations are possible in production, and it is very important that the system receives timely information on material consumption, reject percentage, postponement of production due to some difficulties encountered during the work, etc. <br><br>  For example, at the sewing enterprise integration with the cutting machine was carried out.  Also often requires integration with any CAD, with the company's website, with other solutions.  And this stage of work often takes up to 30% of the budget. <br>  At the same time, without such integrated solutions, the use of an EPR system will not be effective; you will not be able to reach a new level of control and automation of the enterprise‚Äôs operation.  It is very important to understand. <br><br>  Any system is as effective as its weakest link.  And if during the implementation you refuse to integrate in one way or another, and rely on the human factor, errors will necessarily accumulate and the whole system will become unstable. <br>  For example, if we are talking about designing a new product, then all project documentation should be downloaded from the design system (CAD) to the ERP system automatically.  And then in the event of any questions and difficulties, you can always understand what kind of product in question.  And designers will be able to make the necessary changes quickly and without errors. <br><br>  If we are talking about production, it is very important to receive information about incoming orders (for example, from the site or from a special order form), which need to be produced, as well as to transmit information about actually used materials in a timely manner and without errors, which will allow you to continue working no downtime. <br><br>  I have already mentioned above that at the sewing enterprise it was necessary to integrate with a cutting machine, which cut 36 layers of fabric at the same time, it was necessary to obtain information about cuttings, about the number of defects, and to distribute this marriage to the cost of the entire batch of products.  Accordingly, it required an add-in that directly integrated with the machine, so that the system could understand the data that was coming out of it, and send the data to the machine in a format that it understood.  In addition, it took processing for the data from the machine to calculate the scrap and the cost of products. <br><br>  Also in many other cases, it is unacceptable to rely on the human factor, as errors, inaccuracies in the system, untimely input of information lead to disruptions in work.  Therefore, integration is, of course, not a quick and expensive process, but necessary for improving the quality of work. <br><br><h4>  <b>Industry Solutions</b> </h4><br>  In addition to the basic configuration 1C.  SCP there are a significant number of industry solutions.  Create their partner companies 1C based on the basic configuration.  Most often, such decisions appear as a result of the implementation of 1.UPT for some production company.  After that, the modified version of the configuration for a particular industry is being slightly developed, and is offered as a ready-made industry solution to customers. <br><br>  Now on 1C you can find such configurations for almost any industry.  But it is very important to understand the following points: <br><br><ol><li>  The configuration was finalized for the needs of a particular enterprise.  And there is no guarantee that this approach is suitable for your company.  For example, dairy production can create weight curd and sour cream, and can pack these products in certain containers.  It can produce milk, kefir and ryazhenka, and can specialize in yogurt and desserts.  In each of these cases, various modifications will be required.  And not the fact that the proposed in the basic version of the partners will suit you. </li><li>  Industry configurations are carried out by partner companies on the basis of the main one, with significant changes being made to the configuration itself.  And because the update for the basic version of 1C.  SCP for industry configuration will not work.  Users will have to wait until the 1C partner company also carries out updates for the industry version. </li></ol><br><h4>  <b>A few words about 1C.</b>  <b>UPP ERP 2.0</b> </h4><br>  There is also a separate configuration 1C.  SCP ERP 2.0, which were made significant improvements and additions necessary to automate the management of a manufacturing enterprise.  Those.  This configuration is positioned not just as a complete solution, but as a universal solution for a manufacturing enterprise, which includes a full-fledged ERP system. <br><br>  This system is also based on 1C, the configuration is also complex, and not modular.  And because all the features of 1C products in principle, as well as the problems encountered in the implementation of integrated configurations of 1C, are also inherent in this system. <br><br>  On the one hand, version 1C.  SCP ERP 2.0 is really different extended sets of functions, primarily related to issues of automation and control.  But this software product was created relatively recently.  And I think that it is too early to switch to this version due to the fact that it is not yet fully finalized. <br><br>  It constantly comes with updates with new features, new directories, documents, reports, in contrast to 1C.  The SCP, to which the updates include only the correction of identified bugs and updates of the accounting and tax reporting associated with changes in legislation. <br><br>  In addition, the system 1C.  UPP ERP 2.0 is much more expensive than the 1C configuration.  SCP. <br><h4>  <b>Pros and cons of 1 UPP system</b> </h4><br>  The system is indeed complex and, with appropriate revision, it can perform the functions of managing a manufacturing enterprise of a particular type.  It is also important to understand that improvements will be required for each industry.  If the system was created for tailoring, it would be unsuitable at the dairy plant.  Of course, you can also use industry solutions, but I personally do not recommend using such solutions. <br><br>  Just because if the typical configuration of ‚ÄúManagement of a manufacturing enterprise‚Äù does not suit you in many ways, then industry solutions will not work either.  In this case, it will be easier to choose another product or to actually order an individual solution.  And if the typical configuration suits you for the most part, then the number of improvements and settings for the specifics of a particular business for a typical solution and industry will differ little. <br><br>  An important disadvantage of the system is the lack of modularity.  Those.  To solve these or other problems, you can create certain treatments or reports, ‚Äúadd-ins‚Äù above the system.  They will work, but the basic solutions will remain inviolable.  But if for some purpose you need to make changes to the work of documents or directories, you will need to make changes to all subsystems that exist in the configuration. <br><br>  Due to the lack of modularity in this system, it is impossible to make any significant adjustments to the accounting department or, for example, to the work of inventory accounting without significant revisions to documents and directories intended for other departments.  They are all connected and work with the same directories and documents.  However, this feature is widely known, as it is inherent in all software products from 1C. <br><br>  And because significant improvements in this system usually no one does, try to do with external treatments, reports and other add-ins.  Industry solutions are often just a kind of add-on set that was created for a particular enterprise in a given area.  And you still need these or other improvements, the cost of which differs little from the development of the basic configuration.  And the reliability of a typical solution is always higher than the products from partner companies. <br><br>  <b>Conclusion.</b>  If you are satisfied with the basic configuration of the system, it is best to buy and install it.  But at the same time, it is very important that experienced specialists be involved in the implementation of the system, who will be able not only to customize the software, but also make all the necessary improvements for your business, reports, and integrate with other software products and systems. <br><br>  With the right approach, the 1C system Management of a manufacturing enterprise becomes an excellent tool that will allow to obtain a high level of automation of business processes and coordination of work of different departments of the company. <br><br><h4>  <b>Tips</b> </h4><br>  As a conclusion, I want to give some advice to those who have decided to acquire and implement the ‚Äú1c: Manufacturing Enterprise Management 8 Ed.1.3‚Äù program: <br><br><h5>  <b>1. Choose a strategy</b> </h5><br>  SCP is a complex and large product that claims to be universal.  The product is expensive, and I‚Äôm talking here not only about the cost of acquisition, but also about the cost of owning the program - qualified professionals are expensive, and there are very few of them.    ,            ,       . <br><br>   ?       ,  ‚Äú  ,    ‚Äù.      : 1, Excel  .. ‚Äî        . <br><br>  ,    ,     ‚Äî      .   . <br><br><h5> <b>2.  </b> </h5><br>      ,           .        ,        . <br><br><h5> <b>3.         </b> </h5><br>      .   ,    15 .     -  ‚Äú ‚Äù,         ,          .  ,              ‚Äî       .        . <br><br><h5> <b>4.        </b> </h5><br>  1  ,   ‚Äî   ,  ,       ,        .  , ,  , ,    . <br><div style="text-align:center;"> <a href="https://trinion.org/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/-x/wa/fp/-xwafph06imnlkkgjpvgmp9dguq.png"></a> </div></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/304054/">https://habr.com/ru/post/304054/</a></p>
