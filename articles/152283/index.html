  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Position changes in the App Store: in fact, everything still depends on downloads</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Changes in the App Store that happened in iOS 6 received different ratings and can be judged differently from the <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/nevosoft/blog/152189/">user's point of</a> view.  But it would be much more interesting to see how the position calculation algorithms for applications have changed, which basically serve as a measure of success for developers.  Analytical company <a href="http://www.adeven.com/">adeven</a> , which recently launched Apptrace, the App Store analysis tool, has published some data on the ranking change in iOS 6 and the updated App Store. <br><br>  There were rumors that Apple‚Äôs new tally of positions is more based on sessions, social activity and search than on downloads, but the exact combination of these components and what puts some applications above others is still unknown.  Paul H. Muller, the co-founder of adeven, believes that all evidence actually suggests that there are no changes in the ranking algorithm or they are minimal, and everything that happens is due to other shifts, such as a change in search or how components of the store. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/b52/b0c/8b2/b52b0c8b2123b045e0521342b0f7c6b6.png"><a name="habracut"></a>

      ‚ÄúIf the algorithm actually changed and went beyond the limits of downloads, the results would be obvious and fast,‚Äù he explains.  ‚ÄúIf the algorithm was based only on sessions, Facebook would not stand aside.  We can already see that many applications have returned to their positions after the initial fall in positions.  So the idea is simple - behave as usual and try to understand the dynamics of the App Store as much as possible. ‚Äù <br><br>  However, there is undeniable evidence of changing rankings in the App Store along with the design.  Certain applications have really changed their positions, in particular, Apple has begun to more aggressively promote its own applications, reminding them to those who have not installed it, the Genius section gives high positions, and applications with Passbook integration rank higher, says adeven.  So the strategy of getting the best places in the App Store has changed from the point of view of developers, even if the real mechanics of calculating the place remained the same. <br><br>  ‚ÄúYou can try to optimize keywords that are still an unexplored domain, since nobody knows how Apple generates search results,‚Äù says Muller.  ‚ÄúNow more than ever you need to look at what kind of users you acquire with marketing.  If you borrow them, you should not do it blindly, you should look at the quality of the users you are accessing.  Before you could just buy downloads, go to the top and win.  Now applications that fall into Genius and search get the best network effect, even without a large number of downloads. ‚Äù <br><br>  The first evidence suggests that users actually use Genius in iOS 6, which suggests that applications that often fall into the section may be more likely to get a lot of downloads.  But recall that the position of the application is still determined by the same criteria as before - but the changes in the Apple store led to great progress in how applications attract the attention of users and, consequently, more downloads. <br><br>  via <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/09/25/how-the-ios-6-app-store-changes-are-affecting-app-rankings-and-visibility/">TechCrunch</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/152283/">https://habr.com/ru/post/152283/</a></p>
