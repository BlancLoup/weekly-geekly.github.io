  <section class="page js-page"><h1>PR for a startup: which sites must write about your company</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Well-known marketer Andrew Chen wrote in one of the essays that there are only a few channels for scaling the growth of the audience: <br><br><ul><li>  Paid traffic </li><li>  Direct sales </li><li>  Virality </li><li>  SEO </li></ul><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/bcb/a2e/155/bcba2e15580641b9a1331eed3c3bca5b.jpg"></div><br>  The first two channels are usually quite expensive and not suitable for every company.  Virality is almost magic, it is difficult to achieve, it must be initially laid into the essence of your product.  But SEO is available to almost any project. <br><br>  To search engines understand that your site is good and you should send visitors to it, you need a quality product and many good links from other sites.  The times of purchase links are gradually disappearing, link building is becoming much more time consuming, it is closely intertwined with PR, each link requires a creative approach. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  I analyzed which sites most often write about Russian startups.  The data obtained in general make it clear who willingly place information about young companies and who to go to first.  Each project needs to make a selection of sites according to its subject, but in order to make it interesting for everyone, let‚Äôs analyze common start-up lists. 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>
        <script>
          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      For research, I took the following lists: <br><br><ul><li>  Finalists and winners of the webready contest (46) </li><li>  Companies that went through a full-time accelerator of IIDF (199) </li><li>  The first 400 Russian companies with AngelList raised to $ 3 million investment (365) </li><li>  Russian projects on the product hunt (45) </li></ul><br>  In parentheses indicate the number of sites from the list for which in the end it turned out to collect data. <br><br>  I collected lists of addresses of pages, selected domains from them, resulted in one format (without ‚Äúwww.‚Äù And ‚Äúhttp: //‚Äù), cleaned up duplicates, and collected alexa global rank for the remaining ones from the Alexa site.  I threw out very popular sites with a global rank of less than 5,000 (among the IIDF links there were often links not to the company's website, but to a group on the social network). <br><br>  For each of the final list of domains gathered a list of sites linking to them, exported to csv.  I have combined all received files and counted how often this or that donor site is found.  For the purity of the experiment, these data were collected separately for each of the four source lists and for all of them. <br><br>  <b>0. All sites:</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a70/728/a14/a70728a147074d8e979e2d273677e2b3.gif"><br><br>  In the general list, a start-up press predictably occupies a leading position. <br><br>  <b>1. Webready</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a88/692/a67/a88692a67a034ca0a76bfb8bd1d5c703.gif"><br><br>  Here links to the site of the contest and Skolkovo go onto the stage, plus quite a few links from sites that automatically generate pages about all domains.  The competition has been held for a long time, 54% of sites have links from the once popular Startuppoint. <br><br>  <b>2. FRIA</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/4d2/210/4c1/4d22104c17ad41c4961144bbb29f1802.gif"><br><br>  All sites have a link c FRIA (thanks, kep!).  If you did not participate in the accelerator, you can still get a link by writing to their blog, as SkyEng did. <br><br>  <b>3. AngelList</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e4d/d80/0d5/e4dd800d55ad44738706704e92758e11.gif"><br><br>  More English-language sites, about 22% wrote a trendy the-village (in other such a list and there is no close) <br><br>  <b>4. ProductHunt</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/db8/8e4/aa4/db88e4aa43b94b5585c54a7de3b7ab18.gif"><br><br>  Here, too, the press is leading, but the sites themselves are much younger than sites from other lists, they have few links, little SEO traffic, direct links and Ref traffic lead among the channels.  Therefore, it is natural that many donors such as prlog and Advodka made their way into the top 20, which link to almost all significant sites. <br><br>  <b>What to do next?</b> <br><br>  To first of all deal with priority sites, sort the resulting list by domain rank or by attendance and break into the placement.  There are many ways of posting, they will not fit even in one separate article.  The easiest is to simply analyze how other sites were located and act similarly. <br><br>  Find a specific place where the donor refers to the site under study, can be in a search engine using the operator ‚Äúsite:‚Äù. <br><br>  In no case do not engage in spam on comments and forums, buying links or other black and gray link building techniques.  Such methods, even if they work for some time, anyway, sooner or later, the effect of them diminishes.  The maximum effect is provided by high-quality links from the text of articles that people interested in your product will follow.  Strengthen the effect can be due to the additional promotion of the page on which you are located. <br><br>  Links to specific pages promoted will give you more benefit and traffic than links to the main page.  Look in the panel of webmasters Yandex and Google for what search queries you have a lot of views and the average position in the issuance of from 2 to 15. <br><br>  For example, for our site Alimero, <a href="http://alimero.ru/bljuda-iz-lavasha">alimero.ru/bljuda-iz-lavasha</a> is on Google in 8th place in the list for the request ‚Äúdishes of pita‚Äù, this is a good traffic request, if you climb it in the first place, it will give at times more traffic. <br><br>  It is not enough just to insert a link into the article (as I am here).  You need to write a useful article and organically enter the link so that users are interested, for example, to write that the above link is the coolest two recipes - this is on the second page of pita bread with suluguni for breakfast and on the fourth juicy home shawarma, right now I‚Äôll eat it . <br><br>  You can conduct a similar analysis for your niche.  It is useful to make a selection of sites: <br><br><ul><li>  which receive a lot of ref traffic; </li><li>  young sites with high SEO traffic; </li><li>  sites with a lot of SEO traffic, but a small number of donors. </li></ul><br>  All this can be done even without programming skills, right in Google Spreadsheets.  In order not to overload the article, I omitted the details, if interested - write in the comments, I will tell in a separate article how to use Google Spreadsheets in order to easily collect and process the original data. <br><br>  To make it easier for you to conduct a similar analysis for your site, I prepared a list of the 25,000 most popular sites in Russia.  Write to me in a personal, I will throw off this list and complete lists of domains referring to each of the four groups of sites from this article. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/320868/">https://habr.com/ru/post/320868/</a></p>
