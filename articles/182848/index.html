I'll start with the most interesting: <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b>1. Plagiarism software code</b> <br><br>  <b>a.</b>  <b>Opensky-2 vs aeronautics</b> <br><br>  <b>Date of decision:</b> 14.03.2011 <br>  <b>Link to the solution:</b> <a href="http://sudact.ru/arbitral/doc/ZluOeHnBykQd/">sudact.ru/arbitral/doc/ZluOeHnBykQd</a> <br>  <b>The essence of the case: the</b> Claimant (OJSC "Regional Information and Computing Center" Pulkovo ") - the copyright holder of the program" OpenSky-2 ", of which the module" Alerts "is a part.  The defendant (Aeronavigator LLC) is the copyright holder of the Meridian program. <br>  Both holders have certificates of state registration of their computer programs.  The authors of the OpenSky-2 program are the team of authors who created the program as part of their work duties during the period of work at Pulkovo Regional Information Center, including citizen Sorokin SA, who subsequently went to work for Aeronavigator where he became one of the authors of the “Meridian” program. <br>  Expert Document Management LLC Borisov E.V.  Examination of the source code of the OpenSky-2 and Meridian programs was carried out to determine the degree of their identity. <br>  According to the expert, when analyzing the source code fragments of the software products OpenSky-2 and Meridian, a difference (2 lines) was found in the name of the registry branch used to store settings defining the methods of the program, where instead of the \ Software \ RIVC_PULKOVO branch \ AS_RDS (Spp) \ Alerts ", which is used by" OpenSky-2 ", with the same purpose, with the same composition of tags and with the same formats of values ​​stored in them in" Meridian ", the branch" \ Software \ Aeronavigator \ Meridian \ Alerts. <br>  As a result of the study of the source code fragments of the OpenSky-2 program and the Meridian program, it was established that the Meridian program, the rights to which are claimed by Aeronavigator LLC, is completely identical to the OpenSky-2 program, the exclusive rights to which belong to OJSC “ RIVC-Pulkovo. <br>  <b>Solution:</b> Respondent's actions on using the plaintiff’s program by including the source code of the Alerts module, which is part of the OpenSky-2 program, in the Meridian program, and also providing the source text of the Alerts module for state registration in the Rospatent of the Meridian program »Found to violate the exclusive right of the plaintiff. <br>  Compensation for violation of exclusive rights - 500 000 rubles. <br>  <b>Note: the</b> decisions of higher instances (of the Thirteenth AAC of June 28, 2011, and the FAS of the North-West District of October 10, 2011) were upheld by the decision of the court of first instance.

      <b>b.</b>  <b>QuantaFarm vs Pharmacy-Ural</b> <br><br>  <b>Date of decision:</b> 01.10.2012 <br>  <b>Link to solution:</b> <a href="http://sudact.ru/arbitral/doc/T8AoSBxnaQJ8/">sudact.ru/arbitral/doc/T8AoSBxnaQJ8</a> <br>  <b>The essence of the case: the</b> Claimant (LLC "Aurit") - the copyright holder of the program "Program complex for the automation of pharmacy enterprises" Apteka-Ural "(Program complex" Apteka-Ural "). <br>  The defendant (Kvart LLC) is the copyright holder of the registered program “System of automation of enterprises engaged in pharmaceutical activity“ Quartfarm ”.  Both programs are registered in the state register of computer programs. <br>  The authors of the program “Quartfarm”: Korkunov M.A., Fedorov M.V., Razboynikov P.A.  - all three worked initially with the plaintiff, then as a result of a conflict with their management, they left Aurit LLC and moved to Kvart LLC. <br>  To resolve the question of whether one program is a revised copy of another program, the court appointed a forensic examination, which was conducted by expert Sukhanov V. I. (head of the Department “Software and Systems” of the UFU named after the first President of Russia B.N. Yeltsin).  Expert opinion: the program “Quartfarm” is not identical to the program “Pharmacy-Ural”, but the program “Quartfarm” is the result of the processing of the program “Pharmacy-Ural”. <br>  <b>Solution:</b> Prevent the respondent from distributing or otherwise using the QuartFarm program.  The state registration of the “QuartFarm” program in the register of computer programs is invalidated as based on inaccurate information. <br>  Compensation for violation of exclusive rights - 500,000 rubles and 14,000 rubles for the costs of the examination. <br>  <b>Note:</b> In determining the amount of compensation, the court drew attention to the fact that the period of violation of the claimant’s exclusive right to its program was about six months, hence the amount of compensation claimed (500,000 rubles) is reasonable and subject to recovery from the defendant in favor of the claimant. <br><br>  <i>I draw your reader's attention to the fact that the court ruling in the appointment of an examination (evidence that established the fact of plagiarism) established the amount of remuneration of expert V. Sukhanov.</i>  <i>- 14 000 rubles (while the claimant, having won the process, received compensation in the amount of 500 000 rubles).</i> <br><br>  The defendant filed an appeal.  In the appeals instance, the case <a href="http://docs.pravo.ru/document/view/32655333/">was</a> considered by the 17th AAS.  A forensic examination was conducted by experts Khokhlov I.A.  and Dobryakom P.V.  Below, I propose to read the key conclusions from the expert opinions: <br><br>  <u>Khokhlov's conclusion:</u> <br>  1. the complete coincidence of software platforms (operating system, programming language, libraries and database management system) used in both software products was established <br>  2. Descriptions of domain attributes and tables in database structures in many cases have a similar description structure, differing only in attribute names.  The main table has the same name - ARTIKUL (they contain the main links; they also have the same methods for storing billing / expense documents). <br>  3. no signs of formal processing were found in the source texts of the programs (conclusion: the programs were written anew). <br>  4. a match was found between unique and non-obvious abbreviations (conclusion: there was a borrowing from the source code of the Apteka-Ural package, which is a key feature of the processing process) <br>  5. the presence of similar windows with the help of which the main functionality of the program is implemented (this is also a sign of the processing of the program) <br>  6. when creating “QuartFarm”, developers used access to the source code of “Apteka-Ural” and used them as a model when developing their own program texts, database structure and screen forms, i.e.  reworked the program "Pharmacy-Ural". <br><br>  <u>Conclusion of the Good-natured One:</u> <br>  1. functional similarity of programs, there are fundamental differences in the architecture of programs <br>  2. The “QuartFarm” code and the script of its database are significantly smaller than the code and the “Pharmacy-Ural” script.  Available identical names of elements are due to terms from the pharmaceutical industry or from business <br>  3. The number of similar pieces of code in both programs is insignificant. <br>  4. There are indirect signs that the programmer has moved from the Pharmacy-Ural development team to the QuartFarm team, which is a normal event in the IT field. <br>  5. the similarity of the appearance of the programs is explained by the same needs of users, no obvious signs of borrowing were found and there are differences in the architecture (conclusion: the QuartFarm program was developed independently without processing any parts of the Apteka-Ural program). <br><br>  According to the court, expert Dobryak P.V.  He does not refute the findings of the expert Khokhlova IA, which are set out in the research part of the expert opinion, therefore the appellate court confirmed the correctness of the decision of the court of first instance. <br><br>  <b>2.
