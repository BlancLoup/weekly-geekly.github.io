  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The right bag for the right boom</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  There are things from which, having tried once, it is impossible to refuse.  I'm talking about good headphones, a good phone, a comfortable laptop, and a good bag.  Yes, yes, it is about the bag.  We spend a lot of time choosing the very, very beautiful and productive device, and then we put it in the first backpack or briefcase.  And we live without suspecting what could be otherwise.  While the right, thoughtful bag can bring a little less pleasure and benefit than additional memory or a faster processor. <br><br>  Remember the post " <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/boxowerview/blog/222123/">What do habrovchane carry with them,</a> " where people bragged about the contents of their backpack?  To be honest, I was not more interested in the contents, but in what the people wear their things.  So, by the way, one of the most interesting things looked like a photo <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/boomburum/" class="user_link">bag Boomburum</a> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/951/25c/8f1/95125c8f14c34ee5a0c9aca3ff56c825.jpg">

      Today I would like to go to that topic on the other hand and show a dozen different (really great) bags for different tastes, colors and purses. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  A small lyrical digression: I can not say that I am such an authority in bags.  At the moment I have one shoulder bag and two backpacks in which I carry my things with varying degrees of frequency.  Of these, I like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/SwissGear-Travel-Gear-ScanSmart-Backpack/dp/B006HFJA12/ref%3Dsr_1_2%3Fs%3Delectronics%26ie%3DUTF8%26qid%3D1410248291%26sr%3D1-2%26keywords%3DSwissGear%2BSA1923">SwissGear SA1923 ScanSmart the most</a> (price $ 60- $ 70).  He is really well done, thought out to the smallest detail, and he has a pair of very nice chips, like snap keys in his pocket.  But he is too bulky for everyday wear, and I'm thinking about replacing it. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/bab/264/44a/bab26444ac38474a9b554158daa8ddca.jpg"><br><br>  I also have an excellent Grid-It insert, which allows you to make any bag advanced, and a Bellroy travel wallet. <br><br>  It seems like a good set, however, in all this there is one ‚Äúbut‚Äù - for obvious reasons, I could not test a large number of bags and recommend the very thing.  Therefore, I am now offering a small deal: this topic will consist of two parts.  The first, and most voluminous, will be devoted to the choice of professionals.  Well, the second, smaller, already about my things. <br><br>  So, professionals.  There is such a site Thewirecutter.com, the main idea of ‚Äã‚Äãwhich is to take and show the best product for a not very sophisticated user in some category.  For example, the <a href="http://thewirecutter.com/leaderboard/cameras/">best camera</a> , the best <a href="http://thewirecutter.com/leaderboard/theater-audio/">home theater</a> or the best <a href="http://thewirecutter.com/leaderboard/storage/">NAS</a> .  I deliberately wrote "not to the sophisticated user", because any professional and veteran of forum battles will carry this choice to pieces.  But!  For a person who does not have clear wishes and specific criteria, this is what is needed.  The items chosen by the site are really good (truth-truth).  And in the choice of bags, we are the very "not very sophisticated."  So let's trust the professionals. <br><br>  How did you choose?  Initially, the authors (and these are the five editors of the site, plus interviewed very demanding people in terms of bags, like Adam Savage from ‚ÄúMythbusters‚Äù) looked at hundreds of candidates.  Immediately swept aside overpriced options, ugly and low-functional bags.  The resulting 60 candidates were taken in hand, denounced for several weeks and chose the most deserving in different categories and price ranges, publishing in the <a href="http://thewirecutter.com/leaderboard/best-bags/">appropriate section</a> .  And now let me tell you about the options that I personally liked.  If you don‚Äôt like my choice, there are many other good things in the link above. <br><br>  <b>DSLR</b> <br>  Probably the most interesting section is the photo bags.  In addition to jokes, they are usually the most confused in terms of functionality.  I liked this one: <a href="http://thewirecutter.com/reviews/tamrac-zuma-5/">Tamrac Zuma 5</a> for $ 50. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/424/d79/99b/424d7999b5c3432a80af112a25cea6ad.jpg"><br><br>  She looks good at the stage of the first dating.  And this is what the ‚Äúsecond layer‚Äù looks like.  Pay attention to the place for landing "carcass" camera. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/9c8/e04/b0e/9c8e04b0e6cd49f09ec3abc67942af84.jpg"><br><br>  Another reporter bag looks good: <a href="http://thewirecutter.com/reviews/domke-reporterssuper-satchel/">Domke Reporter's Satchel</a> (price $ 100): <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a68/f9d/67d/a68f9d67d475470f93189b3446d0629e.jpg"><br><br>  She is the official bag of the White House News Photographers Association.  However, judging by the photos, it will be functionally worse than the previous version.  But beautiful. <br><br>  Well, a good backpack option: <a href="http://thewirecutter.com/reviews/lowepro-fastpack-250/">Lowepro Fastpack 250</a> for $ 70. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/0db/5df/698/0db5df698427465688231af9b5f12679.jpg"><br><br>  <b>Laptop Backpacks</b> <br>  Perhaps the most massive section.  The authors of the site are distinguished by two clear favorites: the modular backpack of the Mission Workshop R6 Arkiv Field Backpack, starting at $ 210 and outwardly unremarkable GoRuck GR1 for $ 295. <br>  Let's start with the <a href="http://thewirecutter.com/reviews/mission-workshop-r6-arkiv-field-backpack/">Mission Workshop R6</a> .  This is quite an interesting (as well as durable, waterproof and so on) representative of modular backpacks.  The main idea, you guessed it, is the possibility of buying individual items and hanging them on a basic backpack. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f7e/1e9/6a0/f7e1e96a06ac46a0b77d72009c867ecf.jpg"><br><br>  Since even the base can fit a lot of things, with the presence of additional models, the backpack becomes almost bottomless.  Here is a short video that fits there: <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/YtJbIyzjZlM%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=25657,15700002,15700021,15700186,15700191,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhhosClC3SLqPlvP3JWQ6zofIEmvQQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  By the way, it is possible to hang the modules not only at the back (such a rail construction made of nylon is used for hanging), but also on the sides.  Example, here in this <a href="http://vimeo.com/42592757">video</a> , starting from the 32nd second.  By the way, there is a simpler and more ‚Äúthin‚Äù version of the backpack - R2 - without side rails. <br><br>  Alas, but for the functionality you have to pay.  The 20-liter base, which has already been said, <a href="http://missionworkshop.com/products/arkiv-system-bags/configure-your-field-pack.php">starts at $ 209</a> and the minimum ease of assembly will easily pull for $ 300.  Yes, as in any "constructor" here they use the concept of an assembly, and users boast of "user".  So to say, assembled the core, collect and backpack. <br><br>  In general, it should be noted that the topic of modular backpacks has recently become relevant.  For example, recently Kickstarter raised money for a similar project <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/842978788/ember-equipment-modular-urban-pack">Ember Equipment</a> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/936/c0b/905/936c0b905f5d4492a3aa2acf12425982.png"><br><br>  A backpack, well suited to Batman or Blade, is assembled from modules on magnets.  The authors especially rest on security, convenience, and the impossibility of imperceptibly disconnecting any of the modules.  Be sure to watch a <a href="http://vimeo.com/87832276">video</a> about him - it's interesting there. <br><br>  We return to Thewirecutter.com.  The second recommended backpack was <a href="http://thewirecutter.com/reviews/goruck-gr1/">GoRuck GR1</a> .  At a cost of under $ 300, it looks awkward. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/fa4/d9e/377/fa4d9e37722e4520bb34450462c0d843.jpg"><br><br>  However, the authors claim that this 26-liter backpack, firstly, looks for a smaller volume, secondly, it can last for ten years or more, and thirdly, it is very comfortable to wear and easily distributes the load on large hiking journeys.  Generally, they write that the backpack was developed by a company that previously worked for the US Army and was tested on green berets. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/5ff/d80/256/5ffd802560ee4e96a63186445f6c1387.jpg"><br><br>  But outwardly, he did, after all ... Personally, I would prefer instead of him either <a href="http://thewirecutter.com/reviews/topo-designs-daypack/">Topo Designs Daypack</a> for $ 139, or my old SwissGear SA1923 for $ 70. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/2de/2f2/d6e/2de2f2d6ee2f44a4b8af4b59c52dd5e0.jpg"><br><br>  <b>Women Laptop Bags</b> <br>  Most of the reviewers of the bags simply forget about the fact that there are a lot of women around us (hello to the beautiful half of Habr) and they need to a) look beautiful;  b) wear laptops too.  So a backpack very often may not fit in style (especially if it looks like Mission Workshop). <br>  Especially for girls on Thewirecutter there are three models.  I like this one <a href="http://thewirecutter.com/reviews/mcklein-lake-forest-briefcase/">most</a> : <a href="http://thewirecutter.com/reviews/mcklein-lake-forest-briefcase/">McKlein Lake Forest Briefcase</a> for $ 156 <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d79/6f4/728/d796f472840f482da77de02a5a4279f6.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/87d/e0e/15a/87de0e15a29042d1bfb40bc899ee2f5f.jpg"><br><br>  But there is a <a href="http://thewirecutter.com/reviews/solo-vintage-leather-laptop-tote/">simpler</a> model - for $ 68. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/1eb/a31/51a/1eba3151a7564fe9ad9966623bf53eab.jpg"><br><br>  <b>And the last part is portfolios.</b> <br>  Thewirecutter.com editors write that they are just in love with <a href="http://thewirecutter.com/reviews/jack-spade-waxwear-computer-file-case-2/">Jack Spade Waxwear Computer File Case, a</a> seemingly inconspicuous portfolio for as much as $ 400 (in general, they write that the Mission Workshop R6, GoRuck GR1 and this portfolio are the best bags that they have come across).  In the review, the author notes that if he had to choose which bag manufacturer to leave, and blow up the rest to such a grandmother, he would have chosen the Jack Spade without blinking an eye.  Do not be surprised if the author has a poppy at home :) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/919/902/351/919902351071439f9d98388b5712efa8.jpg"><br><br>  But for me $ 400 per bag, this is an obvious bust.  Therefore, I liked <a href="http://thewirecutter.com/reviews/tom-bihn-ristretto/">Tom Bihn Ristretto more</a> for $ 135: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/757/acc/cf8/757acccf8e5a4031992c42ae941fab26.jpg"><br><br>  and two, I think, luxurious portfolio.  The first, roomy <a href="http://thewirecutter.com/reviews/l-l-bean-maine-guide-waxed-canvas-briefcase-2/">LL Bean Maine Guide Waxed Canvas Briefcase</a> , is made of waxed canvas with leather inserts, and has nothing to give out in itself a modern bag, except for the 15-inch laptop compartment. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a7a/b24/a75/a7ab24a75d564c34a798dcbf2093d7fb.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/bb8/005/9a9/bb80059a9ffa4d71951b13d4dc5f636c.jpg"><br><br>  His all-leather version was voted the <a href="http://www.askmen.com/fashion/trends_200/228b_fashion_men.html">best portfolio in 2008</a> according to the site Askmen.  And the manufacturer provides a lifetime warranty on all their bags.  Not bad?  Not bad.  But there is usually a fly in the ointment - due to the large number of compartments and the materials expended, the bag initially weighs under a half a kilogram.  As the author writes a review - it seemed to me that she immediately came with several books inside.  Otherwise, this is just a great everyday portfolio. <br><br>  And the second favorite option: <a href="http://thewirecutter.com/reviews/filson-original-briefcase/">Filson Original Briefcase</a> for $ 250: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/564/06a/17a/56406a17a6e14efe91816b9ddb52a379.jpg"><br><br>  The Dappered website named this portfolio the best in 2012.  It is also heavy (just above 0.5 kg), also made of waxed canvas, and also damn beautiful, ‚Äúfunctional as hell‚Äù and durable. <br><br>  On this with the first part of all.  As I said, I tried to write in general words about the bags that I liked the most.  In the section <a href="http://thewirecutter.com/leaderboard/best-bags/">Favorite Bags</a> you can find other items, as well as reviews on each of the bags.  And now, I would like to tell a little about my experience. <br><br>  I wrote above that I consider the SwissGear SA1923 ScanSmart backpack to be the most convenient and well-thought out of my bags.  It costs more or less and is well done.  But, alas, for everyday wear it seems too big to me.  Therefore, most of the time I go with the usual Mascotte bag that I bought at the sale.  I would not be satisfied with this bag if it were not for one improvement: a year ago I bought <a href="http://www.cocooninnovations.com/cat_info.php%3Fcat_id%3D61">Cocoon Grid-it</a> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/9e2/ca4/6bb/9e2ca46bb7bf4374bc6da7908262a7a0.jpg"><br><br>  In fact, it is such a hard liner in a bag containing a huge amount of rubber straps.  Thanks to these straps, you can push anything into the liner and it will hold tight.  How it looks can be seen in the video: <br><br><iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/b2zULNyGhqw%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=25657,15700002,15700021,15700186,15700191,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhgF0xNQFgIcNudS8rTa9zlfgpVCKA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  It fits a lot, keeps securely and simply unrealistically saves space in your bag.  The same heap of everyday cables is holding on with a bang.  I bought a small liner worth $ 25, and I still consider it one of the most useful acquisitions.  As for the bag itself, alas, it will soon have to be changed.  And apparently, on something from the above list. <br><br>  Another good thing about me is the <a href="http://bellroy.com/wallets/travel-wallet">Bellroy Travel Wallet</a> .  I fly quite often, so a wallet that easily fits a passport, boarding pass, cash cards, airline loyalty cards, as well as a mini-pen (I don‚Äôt even talk about cash) was just a salvation for me. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e47/24c/06f/e4724c06f3a1481fb0c289538c399831.jpg"><br><br>  Interestingly, several acquaintances of ‚Äúthose who came to the fore‚Äù Muscovites (of those who are constantly forced to carry and present their passports), looking at me, also ordered themselves for such a wallet. <br><br><iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/F_SQ7Z6TNII%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=25657,15700002,15700021,15700186,15700191,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhjSGtLIHnvvgUmWX-io6jUKdyxU4w" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  That's all for today.
