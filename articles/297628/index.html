      Gregory Gurevich, co-founder and shareholder of UCS, commented on the purchase of UCS's authorized capital by Rambler &amp; Co as follows: <br><blockquote>  ‚ÄúGetting Rambler &amp; Co as a shareholder will allow UCS to apply the expertise of online services in the further development of business management systems - R-Keeper, UCS Premiere and Shelter to the level of the best world analogues.  Restaurants, cinemas and hoteliers working with UCS systems will receive advanced technologies in 2016 that will analyze online all the basic parameters of the business, including interaction with end users and tools to increase revenue, as well as attract and keep guests in the current economic situation.  Together with Rambler &amp; Co, the largest player in B2C entertainment and hospitality, we will make a big step towards the business of our customers. ‚Äù </blockquote><br>  In addition, Gurevich noted that, in addition to Rambler &amp; Co, there were other companies wishing to become shareholders of UCS, but the choice fell on an Internet holding because Rambler &amp; Co operates in the same business area as UCS.  In addition, enterprises have been partners for several years.  Gurevich added: ‚ÄúThis partner is familiar to us, we represent what they are doing, they know what we are doing, therefore, when choosing a strategic partner, Rambler had an advantage for us.‚Äù <br>  Details of the transaction and the integration of programs and services are not currently disclosed, but Rambler &amp; Co has promised to publish information on each of the projects in the coming 2016. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/297628/">https://habr.com/ru/post/297628/</a></p>
