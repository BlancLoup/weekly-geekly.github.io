  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Express paperwork</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Many have received or lost documents at least once in their life (passport or passport, perhaps a military ID).  Not always the process of getting or recovering went smoothly, without any extra nerves.  I understand that the topic is not so closely connected with IT, but I would like to talk about process optimization. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  It sometimes amazes me how a state with a developed bureaucracy can walk past money.  A commonplace example that I encountered recently is the paperwork (new, lost ones are not important).  Imagine, you need to issue a document: a passport, passport, military ID.  You have a couple of options.  The first is to collect the necessary certificates and assign them for registration, and then wait (usually for a long time and not a fact that it will be ready within a reasonable time).  The second is to look for ways to accelerate (personal charm, presents, etc.), which would entail mandatory cash expenditures, but in time it will be more relevant. <br><br>  Now imagine a situation where the process would be completely regulated.  There are certain deadlines within which you can expect to receive the desired document.  For example, the term is 1 calendar month.  Came, handed over the required information, wait for the deadline and get the document.  Most often it happens that the document is needed urgently: the ticket is burning, you need to get a loan or something else.  Here it would be possible to collect money on quite legal grounds.  That is, set the time and cost of express paperwork, example: 1 day, 3 days, 5 days, 1 week, 2 weeks.  Not all documents can be issued quickly and the timing can be more reasonable.  Accordingly, the smaller the period, the more expensive the design.  Those who are satisfied with the wait or have the opportunity to wait, do the usual way and nothing more, except the state.  duty does not pay.  With express paperwork, you can give a bonus to employees, stimulating them in this way.

      Somehow the ideal scheme seems so.  It has costs for those who do the documents, but there are guarantees to get the right paper in due time.  In the loser is not the state. <br><br>  And what do you think, what would be the disadvantages in this situation?  How could this scheme be optimized? <br><br>  PS: Possible disadvantages are that you have to meet the deadlines for the execution of orders.  Otherwise, the meaning is lost in the event.  And also "around the world" will go offices that provide "assistance in the rapid paperwork."  They simply will not be an urgent need.  The main point in guarantees and the absence of problems during registration (for example, you have handed over the documents, waited a month, arrived, but nothing is ready). <br></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/26478/">https://habr.com/ru/post/26478/</a></p>
