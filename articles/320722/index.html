After World War II, the city lay in ruins at ground level.  Modern Berlin rebuilt, so lovers of ancient buildings there may not like it, as, for example, in Prague.  But for those who appreciate the cleanliness, the German style and the bustle of the big city in Berlin should be enjoyed. <br><br>  How to make so that your trip was not muddled?

Thus, the application will become your information partner in the walk. <br><br>  For example, we at <a href="http://surprizeme.ru/">Surprise Me</a> offer you this route:

    <img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/fc5/16d/5c8/fc516d5c8df3fcf6bde7e15bcca9eb6e.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Start from Alexanderplatz Square, one of the central places of Berlin.  There are various festivals, shows, and just going to young people who play music or just dancing to music.  Near the square is a huge mall "Alex", in the galleries of which you can buy anything. <br><br>  Alexanderplatz is a very social place.  Here you can see a variety of people: from urban madmen to fashionable artists and sellers of shaverma, which is called doner here.  This is the square in its old sense - a place where people meet, walk and do everything they want. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/24e/a71/aab/24ea71aab5d9c3760470f6c33b1fcd2d.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <i>Alexanderplatz</i> <br><br>  After Alexanderplatz heading for the Berlin TV tower.  The structure is very similar to Chupa-Chups or an olive impaled on a skewer.  If you have a desire, then go up to the observation deck, it has a spherical shape, so you may experience a slight panic from the fact that under you almost 400 meters of emptiness.  But these are Germans, these guys are safe.  From 368 meters you will get a gorgeous view of Berlin.  We recommend climbing the tower in the evening when the capital of Germany begins to glow with all its lights. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/3b7/16a/ce9/3b716ace9229951fa115f720e049ec1d.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Not far from the TV tower is the church of St. Mary.  As already mentioned, Berlin was almost completely destroyed during the Second World War.  This small church is the little that remains of the old city. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/9f7/e6d/b16/9f7e6db1663529b1203683f516195dc4.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <i>Kirche St. Mary</i> <br><br>  Next to the church built a chic fountain "Neptune".  Seals, tridents, women with jugs - this is all in the composition of the fountain. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/395/cbc/28c/395cbc28c39e02e38eae3a5ca1060cf3.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <i>Fountain "Neptune"</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/8ce/e65/3f3/8cee653f38f5d50eaff7e7a04b94ab6b.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  On foot, by rickshaw or by other means you can get to the museum island.  Here are: the Old Museum, the New Museum, the Pergamon Museum, the Old National Gallery, the Bode Museum.  Here Surprise Me can be replaced with a museum audio guide, buy a ticket and go through all these wonderful places. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e7f/e3a/ae8/e7fe3aae863a6341fbd7fe84823fb03e.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <i>Museum Island</i> <br><br>  If you don‚Äôt like museums, feel free to go to Unter den Linden‚Äôs boulevard and go all the way to Paris Square, where the Brandenburg Gate is waiting for you - the place that used to divide Berlin to the west and east - the watershed of the whole world of the second half of XX century. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/9c4/428/0a7/9c44280a7d55f0568f06d445812b30c3.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <i>Brandenburg Gate</i> <br><br>  But postcard Berlin is one thing.  In this wonderful modern city there is an area like Kreuzberg.  Previously, it was an extremely poor area with one third of the population of immigrants and representatives of the social bottom. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/1f5/6e2/baf/1f56e2bafcdae823ad051514b1a59fb8.jpg" alt="image"><br>  However, during the development of the city, Kreuzberg turned into a trendy youth place with delicious food and great street art.  For example, on the remainder of the Berlin Wall is the East Side Gallery.  It was here that the painting ‚ÄúFraternal Kiss‚Äù was painted on the wall, in which Leonid Ilyich Brezhnev kisses the head of the German Communist Party, Erich Honecker, on the lips. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ff3/e81/aba/ff3e81aba80bda5eac74352fd74ca081.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <i>"Brotherly Kiss"</i> <br><br>  The area is extremely peculiar - there are huge graffiti on the walls, street musicians and bars for every taste.  Perhaps it is worth coming to Berlin just for the sake of this place.  It is really worth it.  Here, everything has a free atmosphere, and the heart screams, as in the painting ‚ÄúFraternal Kiss‚Äù: ‚ÄúGospodi!  Help me to survive this deadly love. ‚Äù <br><br>  Any route through Berlin can be an adventure for you and your friends along with <a href="http://surprizeme.ru/">Surprise Me</a> .  We suggest you look at the city from a different angle.  Use your imagination and talent - do what you think is right and important to yourself. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/320722/">https://habr.com/ru/post/320722/</a></p>
