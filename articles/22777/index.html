The second part of. </h2>  *** <br>  Finally, the computer finished the analysis and gave the results.  Under the search criteria got about ten groups of IT people, one of which interested me the most.  Among this group was Matvey Krasnikov, my former classmate.  We have not seen him for five years, but sometimes we talked on the Internet.  A big fan of computers, a real geek.  While studying at university, we often dealt with extreme programming in pairs with him, which gave excellent results.  I do not know how I would write a thesis, if not for him.  In recent years, Matvey has been studying PS, direct communication between a computer and a person.  As far as I knew, he was the leader of the PS research team, but he has not yet achieved significant results.  Something told me that the coincidence was not accidental, and I decided to check this option first. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Matvey as always was online and happily agreed to meet.  A rare programmer will refuse free treats, which I promised.  Two hours later we were sitting in a cafe on Mokhovaya. <br>  The waitress brought the order, and Matvey began to eat.  I could not wait to begin questioning more quickly. <br>  Matvey waved his fork and shook his head, being unable to answer articulately.  I poured him wine, he himself lit another cigarette.  It was difficult for me to hide my excitement, but Matvey seemed to have noticed nothing, having buried himself in his plate.  It's good that he is a computer specialist, not a psychologist.  Finally, Matvey dealt with his portion of lasagna.  We sat for another twenty minutes, remembering youth, until Matthew was called from work.  We hugged and said goodbye.  Matvey left, and I stayed to sit in a cafe to digest the information received. <br>  Now everything fell into place.  If Yaroslav could enter his mail, why could he not make it to any other?  A person with unlimited possibilities who has half a year left to live.  After some thought, I made a decision and put out a cigarette.  Got a communicator, typed a message to Yaroslav.  Waiting for an answer was short.  This time the pause was already more serious.  *** <br>  At 20.55 I was at Boris's office. </div>
