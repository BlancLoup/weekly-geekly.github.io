  <section class="page js-page"><h1>CrunchGear's editor-in-chief about Jobs‚Äôs message to Flash fans</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Once upon a time there were two little boys, Apple and Adobe.  In childhood they often hung out and played together, in general, they lived in perfect harmony.  Once Apple got sick, but Adobe was not taken aback and found new friends, the friendly hitherto couple broke up.  Years passed, the guys grew up ... but now Apple did not share common interests with Adobe, not at all because they had once broken up, but because there is no longer any real friendship.  It can be considered a separate world, but with a multinational conglomerate. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/21c/ca7/2e9/21cca72e9eae5009ba2beda2a69adc1a.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Like this, Steve Jobs sees the partnership between his company and Adobe, which he describes in his letter, starting with lines:

      ‚ÄúI would like to share my thoughts on Adobe Flash products so that consumers and critics can better understand why we will not allow Flash to appear on the iPhone, iPod and iPad.  Adobe believes that our decision was dictated by the business - they say that Apple wants to protect the App Store - in fact, the decision is dictated by purely technological inconsistencies.  Adobe claims that we are shutting down the system, while Flash is open, although in reality everything is completely different. ‚Äù <br><br>  Wow!  He put into play the arguments of the "openness" of the system.  It starts to annoy.  Isn't Apple the most closed company in the world?  If you do not pay attention to the fact that OS X is built on the basis of the Mach kernel and takes its roots from FreeBSD, then Apple can be considered the most closed company in the world.  Nevertheless, as you might have guessed, Steve has already noted that Adobe controls prices, the ability to use and update their products, while Apple has to be content with HTML5, CSS and Javascript, which is absolutely open.  Jobs continues: <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  ‚ÄúHaving rejected Flash, Apple gave preference to HTML5, CSS and JavaScript ‚Äî open standards.  Apple mobile devices are characterized by high performance and the use of these standards.  HTML5 is a new web standard that has been adopted by Apple, Google and many others.  HTML5 will allow web developers to create advanced graphics, design and animation, continuing to develop without the use of third-party plug-ins (like Flash).  HTML5 is fully open and monitored by the standards committee of which Apple is a member. ‚Äù <br><br>  Steve also remembered security (‚ÄúSymantec called Flash product the worst for 2009 in terms of information security. We also consider Flash as the main reason for the failure of Mac computers‚Äù), but let's not dwell on it, Apple CEO writes: <br><br>  ‚ÄúFlash is intended for use with computers where the mouse is used for input, not the user's fingers, as is the case with touch screens.  For example, on many sites, so-called rollovers are used, such as pop-up menus or similar objects, which are activated at the moment when the mouse cursor enters a certain sector of the screen.  Apple‚Äôs revolutionary multi-touch interface doesn‚Äôt provide a mouse, and therefore the concept of expanding objects will not work.  Most Flash-based sites will have to be redone so that they can support touch devices.  If developers need to reconstruct Flash sites, so why not immediately use such advanced technologies as HTML5, CSS and JavaScript? ‚Äù <br><br><img src="http://j.imagehost.org/0023/no_flash_on_ipad.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Steve's main message was the idea - Flash sucks.  Is it right that millions of Flash developers will no longer be able to implement their ideas in Flash for iPad?  Definitely not.  Is it correct that users constantly experience difficulties due to a curved code or a small amount of system memory when visiting a Flash site?  Also wrong. <br><br>  Jobs has his own strong arguments, Adobe has his own.  However, we should not attribute this problem to the category of fights between fans: Apple made such a decision, because Flash, according to the company's management, is not for mobile electronics.  If you are an ardent fan of Flash, just look at the device based on Android. <br><br>  ‚Äú <a href="http://www.apple.com/hotnews/thoughts-on-flash/">Thoughts on Flash</a> ‚Äù is an open letter to Steve Jobs, Apple CEO (Eng.). <br>  <a href="http://www.crunchgear.com/2010/04/29/steve-jobs-tells-the-world-just-what-he-thinks-of-flash/">Article</a> editor-in-chief of CrunchGear, John Biggins (John Biggs), about Jobs's letter. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/92451/">https://habr.com/ru/post/92451/</a></p>
