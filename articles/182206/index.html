And not just a book - but a fairy tale, and even the Brothers Grimm.  Hansel and Gretel.  71 applications in the American Store.  Only Red Hat is worse ... <br><br>  On the legs - shoes, on the eyes of a bang, the eyes lowered and on the street ... The icon of the cake, the "fairy tale" in the title.  25 installations per day ... <br>  Smile and pass by. <br><br>  But the book had one little flaw - inside it was beautiful. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  The book violated all the canons of marketing.  The target audience of children's books on the iPad is mothers who dream of a couple of minutes of peace, while the child sticks its tongue out and taps a finger on the touch screen.  Most of all moms are afraid to be bad parents.  So, the book must comply with all the canons - cute, gentle, fun.  Pink and blue, happy animals and mischievous smiles. <br><br>  In the fairy tale, everything was wrong.  In it crows cawed under alarming sounds, witches scowled and the eyes of abandoned dolls lit up with a disturbing flame.  Damn, she was scary.  She was a real fairy tale, the way the Gothic German brothers recorded it.  Where the witch really was going to eat the children that their father took to the forest to die. <br><br>  I did not dare to show her to my four-year-old daughter.  I read it myself 3 times in a row. <br><br>  But for an adult audience, it also did not fit.  She was far from Tarantino with his bloody kitsch, it was still a fairy tale. <br>  The ideal audience is children 6 - 12 years old.  But for them, parents do not swing fairy tales.  They set up cartoons for themselves and torture kindhearted birds.  Such a child will not download the "pie" from the Appstore.  Dead end. <br><br><h4>  Experiment number 1.  Make it so the application is downloaded. </h4><br><br>  To position the book as "a real scary fairy tale."  People will download, see how cool it is.  And buy.  Why?  Well, because she's cool. <br><br><table><tbody><tr><td></td><td>  It was </td><td>  It became </td></tr><tr><td>  <nobr>Title</nobr> </td><td>  Fairy Tale Hansel and Gretel - a magic interactive fairy tale for children </td><td>  Kill the witch.

Give yourself and your children a fairy tale!  Immerse yourself in the fabulous world of the Brothers Grimm!  Experience the adventures of Hansel and Gretel with your child! <br>  We have tried to create an exciting and atmospheric interactive book for children.  This is a book-game, a book-journey, it will not leave you indifferent. <br>  Excellent music, educational games, live illustrations with which you can interact, allow, scene by scene, to plunge from the surrounding reality into a magical world filled with dangers and unforgettable adventures! <br></td><td>  ... Long ago, when fairy tales were still scary, and children were starving, this story came to light.  The story of deceit, magic and valor ... <br><br>  You may not believe in fairy tales.  You can consider yourself an adult and mature, you can even lie that you are not afraid.  It does not matter - the fairy tale will come to your home - just download the application. <br><br>  ... To the crackle of fire in the fireplaces and the noise of cars outside the window, children and adults, generation after generation, grew cold from the loneliness of the dark forest, dreamed of a miracle, froze in amazement in front of the gingerbread house, startled from fright ... But everyone continued to believe - everything will be fine , because it cannot be otherwise. <br><br>  The real story of Hansel and Gretel is a terrible fairy tale. <br></td></tr></tbody></table><br><br>  People began to swing.  In a month we received 8000 downloads (the application is rather heavy and only for the iPad), we were in the top 50 categories of many European countries.  Turned out marked with Apple.  It was not possible to earn only one thing.  Although the number of downloads increased by 3 times, the conversion remained low.  Users enjoyed reading the book (the average time spent by the user in the application is 10 minutes), happily playing mini-games.  But did not buy.  We tried to drop the price to $ 1 - nothing has changed.  The number of purchases of the full version for $ 5 and $ 1 was the same. <br><br>  So now we are designing the next experiment. <br><br><h4>  Experiment number 2.  We increase monetization. </h4><br><br>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/182488/">But more about that in the next article.</a> <br><br>  Well, since this is the ‚ÄúI am promoting‚Äù hub, then with a sense of accomplishment, a link to the application: <br><br>  The video. <br>  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DGQcRHyxMfqg">www.youtube.com/watch?v=GQcRHyxMfqg</a> <br><br>  Link to the full version: <br>  <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/ru/app/id619916984">itunes.apple.com/ru/app/id619916984</a> <br><br>  Link to the free version: <br>  <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/ru/app/id619899587">itunes.apple.com/ru/app/id619899587</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/182206/">https://habr.com/ru/post/182206/</a></p>
