Whether we like it or not, we live in a world where people prefer to use e-mail.  It is fast, convenient, and most importantly - efficient. <br>  As <a href="http://www.mckinsey.com/insights/marketing_sales/why_marketers_should_keep_sending_you_emails">McKinsey &amp; Company</a> found out, to attract new customers, emails are 40 times more effective than Facebook or Twitter - and this is just <a href="https://www.campaignmonitor.com/blog/post/4300/email-marketing-statistics">one of the interesting facts</a> that speak about the success of email marketing. <br>  If your company or startup wants to use this success, good letter design becomes critical.  With such a big competition for the user's attention, an outstanding design should immediately attract attention in order to avoid the risk that it will be sent to the basket without reading. <br>  Reach your customers, create newsletters to reach a mass audience.  This is how professionals do it - and we hope that this article will inspire you to your own outstanding letter designs! <br><br><h4>  01. Experiment with color </h4><br>  The rejection of the color in the photograph and the color toning in this example from <a href="http://thestylishcity.com/acne-studio-nyc-spring-sale">The Stylish City</a> (‚ÄúStylish City‚Äù) are amazing and impressive.  The muted colors and the combination of pink and black create a modern and sophisticated design.  The layout looks attractive and unique, similar to the newsletter and fashion magazine at the same time, however, as before, the focus is on the text located in the center, as well as above the image. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/730/759/d03/730759d033e04e30928e63d021e5a0b1.jpg">

    <h4>  02.Use color to get attention </h4><br>  In this example, from <a href="http://www.isdd.com.au/">IS Design + Digital, the</a> neon color very quickly attracts the attention of the reader and it is very difficult to hold onto and not read the title.  A rectangular stroke around the font enhances this effect so much that the name of the festival is likely to be remembered by even the most disinterested readers.  Strong images, outstanding calls to action (calls to action) and sharp contrast - all these are effective elements within this design. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/39f/fb1/d7b/39ffb1d7b05a49849c0abb90262ca6f9.jpg"><br><br><h4>  03. Have fun with animation. </h4><br><br>  In this example, <a href="http://cargocollective.com/mikaosborn/Let-s-Pin">Mika Osborn</a> used an amusing and creative GIF-animation, which is designed to convey one simple idea (‚ÄúLet's pin‚Äù - ‚Äúlet's make a pin‚Äù, from the name of the social network ‚Äúpintest‚Äù) - in a unique, surprising and memorable way.  The call is well understood by users, it inspires them to subscribe to the blog of the social networking site Pinterest for seeing great new pictures like this one.  The neutral background color and central location fully focuses attention on the gif, and the information around it is placed in such a way that the reader takes the necessary action. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/209/a93/c89/209a93c89616490497121d297140a5c0.gif"><br><br><h4>  04. Keep it simple </h4><br><br>  <a href="http://www.apple.com/uk/macbook-pro/">Apple's</a> mailing list design assumes a lot of free space and a clear focus on the product.  The product is highlighted in bright colors to increase interest, and the information is carefully placed and perfectly aligned, and has a vertical organization for quick and easy perception.  Using different font sizes and different shades of gray allows the reader to understand what is important and what is not.  This design hits right on target with a minimum of elements and a simple structure. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/626/9bf/524/6269bf524fa641d095bea79e6de8bdef.jpg"><br><br><h4>  05. Make the letter shine </h4><br><br>  In this project, <a href="https://www.campaignmonitor.com/gallery/entry/4162/artur">Artur</a> focuses on well-chosen photos and, as expected, they are forced to look at them again.  After them, attention is drawn to the text typed in white, and everything else is left in the shade.  Dark gray complements the colors of each image, giving the letter a cool and modern look. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/074/8b9/b79/0748b9b799154174be0132e5cfa242da.png"><br><br><h4>  06. Use bright colors </h4><br><br>  The palette of bright intense shades and the unique concept of the letter <a href="https://www.campaignmonitor.com/gallery/entry/4250/engage">Engage</a> immediately attract attention.  Bright yellow paired with a patterned texture and black and white graphics forms a simple but fresh color gamut, which undoubtedly stands out from the crowd. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/252/c33/8c7/252c338c766d48b89021b9e28ddaee6b.png"><br><br><h4>  07. Use bright colors </h4><br><br>  You can not go past the case <a href="https://www.behance.net/gallery/4836967/BESPOKE-E-Newsletter-Issue-1-3">Studio Newwork</a> , showing the creative work of agency staff.  Bright background captures attention and effectively frames the image.  This use of color allows the image to "shoot" and directs the look to the important, while abstract elements and creative text layout help to add movement to the layout.  This design combines minimalism with vibrant color, and it's great. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b24/0c2/430/b240c24302c14c718128f22221149d50.jpg"><br><br><h4>  08. Become recognizable </h4><br><br>  The <a href="http://uk.burberry.com/womens-heritage-trench-coat-collection/">Burberry</a> letter is a brilliant solution to showcase their iconic trench and at the same time increase brand awareness.  The design is remembered through the use of sepia (yellow-brown shades) and photos of the iconic coat from different angles.  An excellent selection of font styles, consistently implemented throughout the layout, allows the reader to easily perceive the proposed visual-shaped story.  Simple, effective and easily recognizable design. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/5cf/1b9/199/5cf1b9199212419faaa16779ff84dce5.jpg"><br><br><h4>  09. Less is actually more </h4><br><br>  <a href="http://milled.com/Chanel/VO2a4G8mDbx74U0a">Chanel's</a> strict and beautiful design makes the best use of simplicity.  Only one image representing the brand, one title, one description and one button-call to action, everything is centered, none of the elements overlap the rest.  all centrally focused and aligned, no one element overpowers the other.  Despite the minimalism, the use of the ribbon as a brand image makes the letter playful and attractive. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/98f/ec8/d08/98fec8d089184080aa75af0a4fffb500.png"><br><br><h4>  10. Increase contrast </h4><br><br>  This <a href="http://www.htmlemailgallery.com/index%3Fpage%3D2">churchmedia</a> example demonstrates an interesting way to create a newsletter before an event.  Various fonts, harmoniously opposed to each other, plain and bold, serif and non-serif fonts, as if jumping off the page, creating a visual hierarchy in the layout.  The contrasting but well-matched color palette gives the whole letter a modern look, with a vibrant and positive mood. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/61f/7c9/98b/61f7c998b8754ad78b89617c325619c3.jpg"><br><br>  <i>We will publish another 10 cases in our blog the day after tomorrow, and if you want to personally discuss email design trends and other email marketing issues, we are waiting for you at the <a href="http://mailcon.ru/">Mailcon</a> conference, and find other examples of email design, including domestic ones, and not foreign ones.
