In reality, things are much worse (in general, like in a fairy tale), the farther away the worse.  According to the comments of colleagues commenting on the first article, <a href="https://habr.com/post/423823/%3Freply_to%3D19210923">‚ÄúImport Substitution, a Voice Crying in the Desert‚Äù, I</a> cite references to regulatory documents urging us to ‚ÄúPatriotism‚Äù.  The number of documents is growing, but there is only one problem, or those who compose them are very far from the IT sphere or even worse, in collusion Lobby of domestic developers. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Links, with a few comments: <br><br>  <a href="http://www.garant.ru/products/ipo/prime/doc/71740062/">Resolution of the Government of the Russian Federation of December 20, 2017 No. 1594</a> <br><br>  From January 1, 2018, additional restrictions on the procurement of software for state and municipal needs came into effect.  The document amends the <a href="http://www.garant.ru/products/ipo/prime/doc/71152170/">Order of the Government of the Russian Federation of November 16, 2015 No. 1236</a> ‚ÄúOn the Establishment of a Ban on the Admission of Software Originating from Foreign States for the Purpose of Procurement for Meeting State and Municipal Needs‚Äù, which plays a major role in import substitution of software today.

Software that only the top of the Iceberg wants to ‚Äúimport‚Äù replace, which rests on an elementary electronic base (&gt; 99% of imported ), standards, protocols, firmware ¬´firmware¬ª and many other things - and also imported. <br><br>  It is necessary to touch the ‚Äúevil burzhuinam‚Äù any of these pillars, the sense of our imitation and attempts in import substitution will be- ZERO.  I fully agree that it is necessary to replace imports in certain areas, but why should ALL be strained with this struggle.  It is imperative to protect (import substitute) Critical Information Systems (CIS), IT of the Armed Forces and cosmonautics - everything else, where there is ‚ÄúState Secret‚Äù, but the rest is ‚Äúsuch a war‚Äù simply can not afford.  And how little it is hard to believe that the CIA really wants to harm the local self-government of the city of Muhosranska, Zadripinskaya volost.  On the ground, we will never succeed in squeezing the intrigues of the ‚Äúbourgeois‚Äù into the threat model and conducting a risk analysis (without blowing up the brain and the budget).  After a month of analysis of the technical and software part of the project of import substitution, the result was more than not comforting. <br><br>  In my institution, I can (and have done so far) only replacing the antivirus with KAV, the remaining 99% of the software is not replaceable thanks to GIS and other components of application systems that are not compatible with Russian Software (and not in words and slogans of developers with domestic crafts ). <br><br>  At the moment, it is simply unrealistic to fulfill the plan for ‚Äúoperating systems‚Äù, and most importantly, it is useless - if you have ROSA, AltLinux, and other handicrafts of domestic manufacturers, ‚Äúburzhuiny‚Äù can still dig deeper to spoil: BIOS, EFI, (iRMC-iLO - iDRAC-IPMI), FIRMWARE, RAID FW and other ‚Äúbourgeois‚Äù software - and no import substitution will save.  I have not seen something certified by FSTEC from NDV Firmware, can anyone come across? <br>  And the better our developers rework "the earlier bourgeois Open Source software," the less likely it is that it will stand up and work with their "bourgeois" hardware and software.  I didn‚Äôt see any drivers or programs, either for ROSU or AltLinux (they are all native sources, and the zoo has 3 OS versions from one manufacturer based on three different assemblies of * nix systems - this is possible only in Russia). <br><br>  On the domestic component base, the same question - the Elbrusa and Baikaly processors are also vulnerable due to the lack of Heavy Machinery - there is no domestic equipment for their production, with the sanctions we will remain without them. <br><br>  What are the compiler's own domestic OSs (also a kind of "Heavy engineering") assembled? - I suppose, too, bourgeois? <br><br>  It seems that we are trying to hang the lock on the gate in the middle of the field, but there is no fence nearby. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/89b/dc0/4c3/89bdc04c3d352181e32d18e39d5a6910.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Since I did not succeed in solving ‚ÄúImport Substitution‚Äù in the current interpretation from the first time by technical means, I, as an official, can suggest another way: organizational measures in the same direction. <br><br>  I got some crazy sentences, <b>maybe someone will complement them, correct them, support them</b> : <br><br>  We, as customers and consumers, already have some restrictions and threats of punishment, I propose to mirror them to manufacturers (or they will have some privileges and no responsibility). If the developers are serious comrades, why are they so afraid of competition with imported software, I like A patriot will be glad if they do something so cool that the whole world wants to buy it.  The current direction of movement leads us to a dead end as North Korea.  From whom we want to isolate, there are no purely American companies, almost all of them are transnational, and here we are with our bicycle with square wheels (which nobody needs except us). <br><br>  Manufacturers have already united in the <a href="http://www.arppsoft.ru/">Association of Software Developers</a> <br><br>  <b><i><u>I also propose that we somehow unite in order to legally defend our rights (including the right to survival).</u></i></b> <b><i><u><br></u></i></b> <br><br>  <b><i><u>I propose to come out with a proposal to restrict the subjects to which compulsory decree 1594 of December 20, 2017 (and listed below) is limited to only owners of critical information systems and systems, where there are IT systems with ‚ÄúGostina‚Äù.</u></i></b> <b><i><u><br></u></i></b> <br><br>  Customers are obliged to purchase from small businesses 15% or more (but we ourselves are small). <br><br>  <b><i><u>I propose to come out with a proposal to oblige developers to envisage for the Subjects of small state and municipal customers (SMGiMZ) with a staff of up to 25 people or a budget for their own needs of less than 100 million rubles.</u></i></b>  <b><i><u>per year, editions of products of the type: (SMB, ROBO, Lite, Essential) with price proposals of similar import counterparts (as a percentage of the price of the EnterPrise editions, as with import counterparts).</u></i></b> <b><i><u><br></u></i></b>  <b><i><u>SMGiMZ with fewer than 10 people - FREE editions (for rural settlements), only support if necessary.</u></i></b> <b><i><u><br></u></i></b>  (in fact, a greater number of offices, are far beyond the Moscow Ring Road and do not have a ministerial budget.) As a result, we will save the consolidated budget and much.  Not all the "State" cares about the budget of one-day companies, which will re-brand imported Open Source. <br><br>  Since the original plan provides for a simultaneous period of transition to domestic by all levels of the budget, and therefore the federal budget will not provide for interbudgetary transfers for 2018-2020 for the purposes of import substitution for regions and municipalities.  After 2020, the federal needs for this direction to transfer money to subsidies to lower budgets for import substitution.  In fact, these decrees (if they are not changed) get into the pockets of all the inhabitants of the country outside the Moscow Ring Road, <b>instead of repairing schools and kindergartens, roads and other things, all your tax deductions to local budgets will be eaten by software replacement</b> .  It‚Äôs not realistic to replace in the short term what was purchased for decades on expensive Domestic toys, without significant budget losses (since there is so much money, they will be taken from schools, gardens and other areas of spending local budgets). <br><br>  <b><i><u>I propose to come out with a proposal to change the deadlines for regional replacement plans for the years 2021-2024</u></i></b> <br><br>  <b><i><u>I propose to come out with a proposal to change the deadlines for municipal replacement plans for the years 2022-2025</u></i></b> <br><br>  <b><i><u>I propose to come up with a proposal to impute developers reduced prices for their products like Government</u></i></b> (although they are all created by default for us, merchants are free to buy what they want, without any registry) <br><br>  <b><i><u>I propose to come out with a proposal to impose significantly reduced prices on their products like AE (for educational institutions) or for free for universities</u></i></b> (in universities they still teach in C # and Delphi what place to tie this knowledge to Linux) <br><br>  <b><i><u>I propose to come out with a proposal to charge the Promo Developers with the prices of their products at the level of 50%, when replacing the customer‚Äôs license of the Import counterpart</u></i></b> <br><br>  <b><i><u>I propose to come out with a proposal to charge Promo Developers with the prices of their products at the level of 30% when replacing the license for in-house developed application software on imported components with a compatible one with domestic OS</u></i></b> <br><br>  <b><i><u>I propose to come out with a proposal to exclude from the register of the Ministry of Communications of Developers by 2020 those who did not fulfill the conditions for Promo prices and Lite editions for the SMGiMZ</u></i></b> <br><br>  <b><i><u>I propose to withdraw with the proposal to transfer from the register of the Ministry of Communications of developers who sell their software only as OEM or as part of the PAC (and make a separate register), so as not to put doubts into the ‚Äúauditors‚Äù</u></i></b> regarding the <b><i><u>similarity of imported software solutions and domestic PACs declared as programs</u></i></b> (about RAIDIX ) <br><br>  <b><i><u>I propose to come out with a proposal to allocate new groups in the register of the Ministry of Communications: Hypervisors, storage systems, DBMS.</u></i></b>  <b><i><u>(which are not yet related to OFFICE software)</u></i></b> (check the functionality of domestic developments for compliance with the stated group, too many virtualization systems are unknown, which Gartner's Magic Quadrant does not know about) <br><br>  Your captain "Evidence."
