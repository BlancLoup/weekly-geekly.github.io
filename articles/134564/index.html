  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Air cooling server DIY</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Cooling the server is a hot topic. <br><br>  In my jurisdiction there is a 3.5 * 4m room, in which there are 5 servers in buildings of the type Tower.  In the summer, the room was cooled with a 1kW mobile air conditioner.  Emission of heat through a corrugation into the street by the forces of the air conditioner. <br><br>  In summer, the air conditioner copes well with the task and is able to maintain the temperature in the room up to + 19 ¬∞ C.  This solution is quite cheap.  Conditioner price about 13000r.  After talking with air conditioning specialists, I found out that such solutions are used quite often, the air conditioner lasts for 2-3 years of continuous operation, after which the compressor that drives freon fails, and its replacement costs about 70% of the air conditioner cost.

      Winter has come. <a name="habracut"></a>  A corrugation that removes hot air significantly heats the air around it.  Air conditioning has stopped turning off.  Temperature is kept by +22 ... + 23.  I felt sorry for him.  The city in which I live is in Siberia, for 6-7 months, the street temperature is below + 19C.  Quite often there are articles about cooling data centers with ‚Äústreet‚Äù air.  I do not have a datacenter, but I still want the equipment to live long and work smoothly. <br><br>  It was decided to make a system that would control the temperature in the room, and, if necessary, produce cold air intake from the street, and fed it to the server room.  For the air intake, we will use the same corrugation that was used for the removal of hot air in the summer. <br><br>  There was no desire to buy any specialized installations, all of a sudden it will not work. <br><br>  Temperature controller assembled on ATMega8 + DS1820.  When reaching + 20C, the microcontroller through the optocoupler turns on the relay, which in turn turns on the fan for air intake.  As soon as the temperature drops to + 19C, the air intake stops.  The accuracy of my sensor is 0.5C.  I took from the supply manager B.  fan, scotch and went to assemble the installation.  What came out of this can be seen in the photos. <br><br>  Fan motor power is 100W, 10 times less than air conditioner consumes during continuous operation.  Energy savings are quite tangible, especially since 1 kW is more expensive than for physical.  individuals. <br><br>  Subtleties: <br><br>  1. Corrugation should be removed to the very facade of the building.  In my case, the builders did not fully insert the corrugation through the brick wall and when the air intake was sucked in dust and crumbs from the bricks, I had to redo it. <br>  2. The sensor is better located on the same level with the servers. <br>  3. It is generally better not to show such a thing to the manager, mine didn‚Äôt appreciate it, said it looks awful.  I agree that it looks funny, but it works, it performs its functions and even saves electricity. <br>  4. Be sure to vent to relieve excess pressure.  In my case, it turned out to be enough openings in the corridor behind the false ceiling. <br><br>  What I plan to do: <br><br>  1. Install a fine mesh at the entrance of the corrugations from the street, now there is a rather large mesh. <br>  2. Install an air filter in front of the fan.  Filter has not yet chosen. <br><br>  A microcontroller via USART can be connected to the computer‚Äôs COM port and monitor the temperature status in the server room.  During the debugging process, I connected to the laptop and tracked the sensor readings in the terminal. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/134564/">https://habr.com/ru/post/134564/</a></p>
