Tournament favorites are ITMO University, Moscow State University and MIPT.  The strongest foreign rivals are Peking University, Xinhua University (China) and Seoul National University (Korea). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/nw/ol/we/nwolwezflaae8odvhxmccizyxuk.jpeg" alt=" ICPC 2017" title="Final ICPC 2017"><br><br>  For the last six years, the ICPC World Cup has been given to each other by teams from ITMO University and St. Petersburg State University.

For comparison: at the Summer Olympics in Rio, 11,544 athletes competed at all stages. </li><li>  140 teams from over 50 countries compete in the ICPC 2018 World Cup final. </li><li>  The Russian teams in the ICPC 2018 final represent 11 universities from six cities: <br><ol><li>  Moscow University of Physics and Technology, </li><li>  Moscow State University, </li><li>  ITMO University (St. Petersburg), </li><li>  St. Petersburg State University, </li><li>  High School of Economics, </li><li>  Moscow Aviation Institute, </li><li>  Novosibirsk State University, </li><li>  Perm State University, </li><li>  Saratov State University, </li><li>  Academic University (St. Petersburg), </li><li>  Ural Federal University (Ekaterinburg). </li></ol></li></ul><br><h3>  Competition Rules </h3><br>  To get to the final competition, teams must first pass the selection in their university, and then the regional round (regional semi-final).  So, more than 300 teams participated in the qualifying round in Russia and the CIS.  According to the results of the semi-finals, 16 teams representing North Eurasia were selected for the best results. <br><br>  In one team there can be no more than three students not older than 25 years.  Those who participated in the world final twice are not allowed to participate in the championship.  In five hours, programmers must solve from 8 to 12 algorithmic problems whose conditions are written in English. <br><br>  Teams write solutions in Java, C, C ++, Python, and Kotlin and send them to the testing server. <br><br>  Programs are tested on a large number of entrance tests unknown to participants.  If the program gave the wrong answer or did not meet the time or memory restrictions, a message about this is sent to the team, after which the participants can send the corrected version.  The problem is considered solved if the program has issued the correct answers on all tests.  Unlike other olympiads, partial solutions are not taken into account.  The winner is the team that correctly solved the largest number of tasks.  If several teams solve the same number of tasks, their position in the ranking is determined by the penalty time. <br><br>  The peculiarity of the tasks is that their conditions are close to what program practitioners can meet in their work.  One command is given one computer without access to the Internet or another external network.  The guys have to show teamwork skills that are required when developing a real software product in any IT-company.  In addition to logic and the ability to work under pressure, competitors must demonstrate the skills of team play and the correct distribution of roles.  According to the organizers, in order to solve some problems, it is enough only to be careful and attentive.  For other tasks, however, an in-depth knowledge of various algorithms is required. <br><br>  Tasks are checked automatically by tests that are prepared in advance by the jury, decisions are checked in real time.  The completeness and speed of the assignment is taken into account, as well as the number of attempts that the team has made in solving a task. <br><br>  ICPC champions receive the World Cup and a substantial cash prize of $ 15,000.  The rest of the winning teams also do not leave without a material reward.  The teams that took the first four places will receive gold medals and $ 7,500 each.  From fifth to eighth place - silver medals and $ 6,000.  And those participants who finish the competition in the ninth - twelfth place, become owners of bronze medals and 3,000 dollars. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/353792/">https://habr.com/ru/post/353792/</a></p>
