Global growth in mobile advertising spending is expected to increase from 5.1% to 12.9% between 2014 and 2017. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/22d/0b5/d66/22d0b5d6659c42ddbc169f767b206af7.jpg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Being already at the leading positions in Australia, Canada, Denmark, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden and the UK, the Internet will become the main driving force in China, Finland, Germany, Ireland and New Zealand by 2017.  In the rapidly developing countries of Asia, including China, India, Indonesia, Malaysia, Pakistan, the Philippines, Taiwan, Thailand and Vietnam, the most active growth is expected between 2014 and 2017 at the level of 9.1% annually. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f4a/bc6/a64/f4abc6a6462744c4b8fe6b669c9643a2.jpg"><br><br><br><h3>  <b>Fallout Shelter will be released on Android in August</b> </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a83/307/32b/a8330732b0854b21b842cb2e648e3df2.jpeg"><br><br>  Justice planned its celebration, it seems, in August: Fallout Shelter will <a href="http://kanobu.ru/news/fallout-shelter-vyijdet-na-android-v-avguste-376951/">finally be released for android</a> !  If someone does not know, then this is a simulator of refuge in the Fallout universe.  We can not say that the game is incredibly cool, but the results for the income showed just fantastic!  Literally right after the start, she famously walked around Candy Crush Saga and still feels rather well.

      We are patient and wait for Fallout Shelter on android and full Fallout 4 for PC. <br><br><br><h3>  <b>Tapjoy helped to increase Kingdom Age revenues by a factor of 2</b> </h3><br>  Correct pricing and fair valuation of game currency, from the point of view of the players, of course, is not the key to success, but it can affect very much.  This was <a href="http://apptractor.ru/marketing-monetization/tapjoy-pomogla-v-2-raza-uvelichit-dohodyi-kingdom-age-za-schet-pravilnogo-kursa.html">clearly seen by</a> Gree on her project Kingdom Age, raising profits by 90% after changing her pricing policy. <br><br>  The problem came to light almost by chance, at the time when Tapjoy offered an offer in which players received rewards for watching a video or subscribing to other services.  High demand showed that the existing prices were greatly inflated.  A number of experiments showed the price to be fair and increased the profit of the game by 90%. <br><br>  A rather informative lesson and another demonstration of the fact that all important decisions should be criticized and, if possible, ensured that they were correct in controlled experiments. <br><br><br><h3>  <b>Ryn-melon-melon 2.0</b> </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/6a8/14e/683/6a814e68360f4b3daf73fc3f3f467a72.jpg"><br><br>  130 million downloads in three years made CSR Racing one of the top brands in Zynga.  But time passes, and something new is needed.  Well, ta-dam!  CSR2, <a href="http://venturebeat.com/2015/07/01/zyngas-naturalmotion-revs-up-its-first-look-at-csr2-mobile-racing-game/">how unexpected</a> .  According to Torston Reil, the head of NaturalMotion, they are trying to make the new game as realistic and reliable as possible.  ‚ÄúA huge leap in quality,‚Äù whooh, we are even invited to connect our iPad to the TV and enjoy the picture. <br><br>  Attention to detail, access to a large pool of models from partners, including those not yet released, not one car in the garage, but a whole large hangar with your collection ‚Äî NaturalMotion is trying hard!  After all, it can be very difficult to convince players to switch to a new part of the game, when so much is invested in the old one.  Mm, well, then even more: in addition to the beauty and attention to detail, we are promised not only a drag-flight, but also a new game mode.  Plus, buying a car in the game promises to wrap in two layers of increased solemnity!  Soft lunch very soon, the company threatens to listen to the players, very tempting, we are waiting! <br><br><br><h3>  <b>Only 33% of applications use messages within applications, but they receive 3.5 times more returns.</b> </h3><br>  Today, only a third of the applications on the market use internal messages, but this gives them 3.5 times more user returns - this is indicated by the <a href="http://info.localytics.com/blog/in-app-messages-drive-higher-app-usage-and-engagement-benchmarks">results of a survey by</a> the analytics platform and the marketing of Localytics applications.  The study involved more than 28,000 applications and 1.5 million devices. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/340/24c/fce/34024cfce32c45089ca269ab2944d07f.jpg"><br><br>  It is almost the most important indicator for today - users are getting more expensive, and it is necessary to make every effort to keep them and return to the application.  The main problem noted by Localytics business analyst Dave Hoch is how not to make another spammer, which will only scare users away.  While the average involvement in messages within applications is only 28%, involvement with messages that correspond to user actions reaches 56%.  If the user has already started interacting with such a message once - for example, having made a choice of something, he is 4 times more likely to convert in the next message. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b08/6c7/dbf/b086c7dbf96d4ff3ab87ccdd3c027776.jpg"><br><br>  But it is important to note that Localytics studied only messages within applications, and push messages are also a popular form of engagement.  It is important to find a thin line between spam and an important message for the user, which will attract his attention and return it to the application. <br><br><br>  ************************************************** ************************************************** ***************************************** <br>  If you liked the material and you had time to evaluate the professionalism of the authors of this blog - there is an opportunity to join them.
