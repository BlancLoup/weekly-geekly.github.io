It is more accurate to say "founded."  Milber himself at Habr√© is known very well, since he is the largest investor of all sorts of Internet projects, not to mention his share in Mail.Ru Group and DST.  On July 31, the Fundamental Physics Prize was announced, and the website of the award itself was also opened.  The award itself is not intended to award all sorts of Internet actors, as one might think.  No, it will be awarded (and has already been awarded) to scientists working in the field of theoretical physics, or rather, an area that deals with questions of the origin of our Universe. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>  As mentioned above, the prize is the largest of all existing.  The amount received by the winner is $ 3 million.  This is even more than the size of the Nobel Prize (1.1-1.2 million).  Now announced the names of nine scientists who were awarded a new prize.  Unfortunately, there are no scientists who work in their native lands.  But people from the CIS are, for example, Andrei Linde, who developed the inflationary model of the universe (based on "motives", so to speak, of the theory from Alan Guta, also the winner of the Fundamental Physics Prize).

      Scientists have learned about the award unexpectedly for themselves, and this happened only a few weeks ago.  Now those who received the award are thinking about how to dispose of it.  In general, there is nothing surprising in the fact that Milner founded the award specifically in the field of theoretical physics - he himself came from Moscow State University, where he studied at the Faculty of Physics, after that he was engaged in the very theoretical physics.  The leader of the Milner was the Nobel Prize winner Vitaly Ginzburg.  A little later, Milner still left science, and went into business, where he excelled. <br><br>  The Fundamental Physics Prize, as mentioned above, is an annual award.  This year, the winners have already received a well-deserved award.  The next award will take place in the first quarter of 2013. <br><br>  Via <a href="http://www.nature.com/news/theoretical-physicists-win-massive-awards-1.11094">nature</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/288274/">https://habr.com/ru/post/288274/</a></p>
