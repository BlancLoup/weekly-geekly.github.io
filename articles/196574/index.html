Running applications on servers available on the Internet can provide many benefits.  Wherever they work, applications are based on a specific platform.  For applications running on a local network, this platform typically includes an operating system, data storage, and other components.  For applications running in the cloud, a platform is also needed.  This is the main purpose of Microsoft Windows Azure.  This course is dedicated to providing IT professionals with the basic knowledge necessary to successfully work with Windows Azure. <br><br>  <a href="http://www.microsoftvirtualacademy.com/training-courses/hpc-clasters-in-windows-azure-rus">HPC clusters on demand in Windows Azure</a> <br>  This course is dedicated to providing IT professionals with basic knowledge of the cloud services concepts of the Windows Azure platform, which can be used to deploy supercomputer clusters that can perform various types of tasks (MPI, SOA, Excel).
