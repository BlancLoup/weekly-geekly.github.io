A large business using these technologies gains an undeniable competitive advantage.  The 2019th promises to everyone even more fly to the clouds. </p><br><p>  New enterprise platforms combine highly developed services and low-cost cloud infrastructure. </p><br><p>  So how will cloud technology impact the year 2019? </p><a name="habracut"></a><br><ol><li>  Enterprise spending on cloud services will increase.  Companies update existing applications and legacy systems.  At the same time, there is a simpler way: software as a service (SaaS) will become even more widespread. </li><li>  To use hybrid and multi-cloud platforms will become more frequent. <br>  Today, companies distribute information and workload across enterprise infrastructure, hybrid and multi-clouds.  Or even simply acquire software as a service (SaaS) - and then everything is served by the supplier.  This greatly simplifies the work and increases the transparency of costs.  The trend will continue. </li><li>  Availability will increase.  In 2019, we will see the continuation of the mass distribution of technology.  From virtualization and hypervisors to cloud technologies.  The leading factor will be open source applications.  This will affect all areas from the application stack to the operating systems.  The scope of development will be key and will have a significant impact on the whole year. </li><li>  In 2019, there will be a mass of services that can meet the demand of almost everyone.  From integration with blockchain technology to mobile systems.  Cloud technologies will offer services of integrated platforms as a service (iPaaS), data protection as a service (dPaaS), mobile backend as a service (mBaaS), etc. </li><li>  Full Stack developers will need to understand data processing engines.  With the transition of enterprises and organizations in the cloud, data engineers open up new opportunities.  More and more businesses are taking advantage of data processing and analytics at key points in their business.  It is assumed that developers will need knowledge of Spark. </li><li>  The introduction of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning.  It started back in 2017 and since then has only been gaining momentum.  In 2019, we expect accelerated development in this area, because more and more enterprises are moving to the cloud. </li><li>  Specialists in education in IT.  Although special trainings for IT workers already exist, it is expected that there will be trainers who will be purposefully engaged in staff training so that it can keep up with the times in cloud technologies.  They will work closely with IT directors to combine learning objectives with company roadmaps for best results. </li><li>  Containerization  When containerizing an application or service, its dependencies and configuration are packaged together in an image of the container.  Containers contain all necessary and ready-to-use files, configurations, libraries, etc.  At the moment, they play a key role in the implementation of cloud technologies and are very attractive to the IT world due to portability.  In 2019, a significant increase in containerization is expected, especially with regard to small services. </li><li>  Older applications will be superseded by cloud services.  When cloud technologies first developed, companies, as a rule, simply dumped their infrastructure into the cloud.  Now it is expected that the functionality provided by cloud providers will replace and replace their own enterprise applications.  We are talking about databases, solutions for Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning, etc. </li></ol><br><p>  So, the key points: </p><br><ul><li>  Wide distribution of a variety of cloud services </li><li>  The need for specialists who understand cloud technologies </li><li>  Development of AI and Machine Learning </li></ul><br><p>  The year 2019 promises to be dynamic.  There is no longer any question of the advantages or disadvantages of cloud technologies - the question is who will take advantage of cloud services faster and thereby win in the competition. </p></div>
