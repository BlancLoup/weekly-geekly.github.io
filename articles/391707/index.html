  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Overview bb-mobile Techno W10.1 Wi-Fi: when the Windows-tablet turns into a full-fledged laptop</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  In 2008-2009  Dozens of so-called netbooks, miniature laptops based on first-generation Intel¬Æ Atom ‚Ñ¢ processors, appeared on the market.  Within three or four years, they enjoyed a very tangible demand, but then the "netbooking" came to naught.  Why is that?  The iPad was popularized, and then other tablets, as a result of which it turned out that for many, many users, the keyboard is optional.  For entertainment and Internet surfing just a big screen, which the tablets just have.  In general, netbooks in the classic form went to the dustbin of history, and they were replaced by transforming tablets.  That is, models that can be used both as tablets and laptops - when connecting a complete keyboard.  Such devices are more universal and netbooks, and conventional tablets.  Today we have just a transformer on the review: bb-mobile Techno W10.1 Wi-Fi. <br><br> <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/bb-mobile/blog/272742/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/768/ea7/b03/768ea7b0344656d3183d0da71b0266d1.jpg"></a> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The peculiarity of our hero in the following.  With 10-inch transformers on Windows, almost always there are removable keyboards, but they are usually made in the form of a cover or a docking station, which do not allow turning the tablet into a full-fledged laptop with the ability to fold.  Meanwhile, bb-mobile Techno W10.1 Wi-Fi is equipped with just a keyboard with the ability to adjust the angle of the screen and the ability to fold - like a full-fledged laptop.  Only A-brands like Acer and ASUS have analogs, and these same analogs cost from 25 thousand rubles.  Meanwhile, bb-mobile Techno W10.1 Wi-Fi give for 15,490 rubles - by the standards of Windows-tablets is a budget solution. <br><br><h2>  Specifications </h2><br><blockquote>  <b>Screen:</b> 10.1 inches, 1280 x 800 pixels, IPS, capacitive <br>  <b>Processor:</b> Intel¬Æ Atom ‚Ñ¢ Z3735F, 4 cores, 64 bits, 1.83 GHz <br>  <b>Memory RAM / ROM:</b> 2 GB / 32 GB <br>  <b>Memory Cards:</b> MicroSD <br>  <b>Front:</b> 2.0 Mp <br>  <b>Main camera:</b> 5.0 MP <br>  <b>Wi-Fi:</b> + <br>  <b>Bluetooth:</b> + <br>  <b>OTG:</b> + <br>  <b>Battery:</b> 7,000 mAh <br>  <b>Operating system:</b> Windows 10 <br>  <b>Dimensions:</b> without keyboard: 256 x 175 x 11 mm / 602 g, with keyboard: 260 x 181 x 23 mm / 1185 g <br>  <b>Price:</b> 15 490 rubles </blockquote><br><h2>  Package Contents and Keyboard </h2><br>  bb-mobile Techno W10.1 Wi-Fi comes in a blue box with white fonts.  Neat calm packaging, which is rare for bb-mobile.  Often this brand offers its tablets in very bright, ‚Äúscreaming‚Äù boxes - just recall, for example, the bb-mobile Techno Molotoff model.

It has a rigid hinge, is equipped with reliable latches with a lock and is easily detached if necessary.  Keyboards of tablets from other manufacturers are built into the case, connecting with the tablet via Bluetooth, mounted on magnetic clasps or not attached in any way, connecting with a cable.  All these methods have obvious disadvantages.  The bb-mobile Techno W10.1 Wi-Fi keyboard allows, without confusing extra wires, to work with the tablet as with a laptop, even in the absence of a table, without worrying that it suddenly comes unfastened and falls.  And if you close it, then the screen also reliably protects when carrying the device.  In general, bb-mobile Techno W10.1 Wi-Fi is a true full-fledged transformer: the device can act as a tablet and a laptop (and not a ‚Äútablet with a keyboard‚Äù as analogs). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/b11/fe2/614/b11fe261480ce3d73b1305eb8189abe0.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/2d1/07a/dea/2d107adea1cb372e75e06ecfe31042a0.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/a72/343/6c8/a723436c8b09b51cfed5cbe19193df4d.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/4fd/aa4/cb4/4fdaa4cb405e3ddf6d2b2821f7ca1d0f.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/c5c/3fb/f2c/c5c3fbf2cb6b70c6ab2cb04d264046d4.jpg"><br><br>  As for the convenience of the keyboard, then it will say so, typical.  Approximately, like the same netbooks.  There is no backlight, but the keystroke is clear, the touchpad is quite comfortable and supports multitouch.  You can only find fault with the size of the Enter button, which is rather small. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/772/32a/28b/77232a28b684969d8e9a38bf94145622.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/b40/541/e87/b40541e874a3f4aec2f637413ac0eb08.jpg"><br><br><h2>  Body and structure </h2><br>  The case of bb-mobile Techno W10.1 Wi-Fi is made of soft-touch plastic, that is, as if with rubber coating.  The build quality, as they say, inspires - I already twisted and bent the machine, and that way, but I could not hear the squeaks.  On the front panel of the device are a 2 megapixel webcam, an LED and a touch key with the Windows logo.  Clicking on the latter leads to the opening of the Start menu, which is typical for tablets on Microsoft OS. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/837/7c5/720/8377c5720611150b6795e531ba9102e8.jpg"><br><br>  On the left side of the case of bb-mobile Techno W10.1 Wi-Fi are all the main ports and connectors: microSD card slot (hidden under a plastic lid), MicroUSB, HDMI, USB port, charger connector, 3.5 mm headphone jack, microphone.  It is worth recalling that the OTG-cable is included in the delivery of the device, which allows you to add another USB port.  Moreover, another connector of this type is located on the keyboard - just as many as three pieces. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/5da/47b/2e1/5da47b2e138db891a019219b4effd34f.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/adc/577/821/adc5778211798599cb44f34306198f70.jpg"><br><br>  The power and volume keys are on the top of the case.  They are quite comfortable, it is not difficult to find them blindly. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/930/c3d/d41/930c3dd417255c0e8c23c6ada4c6a809.jpg"><br><br>  There was a place behind the camera, the bb-mobile logo and a pair of speakers.  The last loud ones are just enough to provide comfortable viewing of the movie together for one tablet. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/bcc/eb0/8a5/bcceb08a5e0a7cc8dc5b8eea86d2a9b0.jpg"><br><br><h2>  Screen </h2><br>  bb-mobile Techno W10.1 Wi-Fi is equipped with a 10.1-inch IPS-screen with a resolution of 1280 x 800 pixels, which is the standard for low-cost Windows tablets.  You can‚Äôt say much about this screen: the picture is bright enough, the viewing angles are wide, the resolution is enough for comfortable work in the Windows 10 environment, under which our hero works. <br><br>  It is worth recalling that in the delivery of bb-mobile Techno W10.1 Wi-Fi includes a stylus for capacitive screens.  However, it is hardly necessary for all users without exception: Windows 10 is not bad sharpened by finger control, especially in tablet mode. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/6e0/281/e4a/6e0281e4abd6d6a664c70a362889f510.jpg"><br><br><h2>  Cameras </h2><br>  The bb-mobile Techno W10.1 Wi-Fi front-facing camera has a resolution of 2 megapixels, the main one is 5. This is a pretty good configuration: most often, cheaper (and therefore lower-quality) modules of 0.3 and 2 megapixels are used in such devices respectively.  In general, against the background of "classmates" bb-mobile Techno W10.1 Wi-Fi shows very good pictures. <br><br>  Examples of pictures from the main camera: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/0d6/d95/f3c/0d6d95f3ca1a2939a0689612fcb79cb5.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/3ae/399/44d/3ae39944de0913a08dd2abd56e9dc58a.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/0ff/72f/7a7/0ff72f7a798c157e62624f8e39d9586c.jpg"><br><br><h2>  Hardware platform </h2><br>  Like the vast majority of modern tablets on Windows of the lower and middle price ranges, bb-mobile Techno W10.1 Wi-Fi is based on the Intel¬Æ Atom ‚Ñ¢ Z3735F processor with four x86 cores that can accelerate to 1.83 GHz.  This, yes, in the ‚Äúbundle‚Äù with 2 GB of RAM, is enough for solving office tasks.  Watching HD-video, working in Photoshop and playing games 3-4 years ago (for example, Quake 4) on a tablet is also possible without problems, and it is short-sighted to demand more from a portable compact device.  By the way, developers should be commended for 2 GB of RAM and 32 GB of internal memory: there are 10.1-inch Windows tablets on the market in the ‚Äú1 + 16 GB‚Äù configuration.  This is not enough for full-fledged work with adult Microsoft operating systems. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/aa5/2f4/903/aa52f4903d98f648ea57d3c84fa6508c.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/ff3/e7c/aec/ff3e7caec8d8b12b8825a938dcbf1dc1.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/b40/30f/934/b4030f93440b028b07414114c9002cb4.png"><br><br>  Intel¬Æ Atom ‚Ñ¢ Z3735F is distinguished by an enviable economy and a cold temper.  Thanks to the use of 22-nanometer process technology, it does not require coolers, rather passive cooling.  Therefore, bb-mobile Techno W10.1 Wi-Fi is completely silent.  And for a long time: HD video can be watched on it for 10 hours (with average screen brightness and wireless modules turned off), and in the ‚ÄúInternet + Word‚Äù mode the device is able to work for about 8 hours.  Battery capacity is 7,000 mAh. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/536/66a/367/53666a367a042e957fcf0dc0d3c51a3b.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/d5e/45f/47c/d5e45f47c6f3ed005904a7b0ca43da69.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/87e/813/80c/87e81380cf100fbcf11d18409bc38e52.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/6f7/138/367/6f7138367da90d1a23943a87ee250e63.png"><br><br>  By the way, about the wireless modules.  The device provides Bluetooth 4.0 and Wi-Fi 802.11b / g / n.  There were no complaints about the operation of both adapters during testing. <br><br><h2>  operating system </h2><br>  Reviews Windows 10 is written apparently invisible, so we will not repeat.  Just take a few screenshots and recall that this time Microsoft managed to make a really smart and convenient operating system - including for use on tablets. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/41d/dd3/6ba/41ddd36bad5b159b4f4f0205ba333297.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/5fe/121/579/5fe121579f1cbdf856b4713918eddffc.png"><br><br><h2>  Conclusion </h2><br>  bb-mobile Techno W10.1 Wi-Fi made a very pleasant impression - mainly due to the design of a complete keyboard.  She, as mentioned above, allows you to turn the tablet into a truly full-fledged laptop - with the ability to adjust the screen tilt and the ability to fold.  Yes, there are slightly cheaper solutions (for 1 000 rubles or so) of this type, but they are equipped with docking station keyboards (without angle adjustment and folding) or soft keyboard covers that also do not allow Turn the tablet into a laptop.  Meanwhile, bb-mobile Techno W10.1 Wi-Fi - allows.  This is his trump card.  Other trumps, however, also have: 2 GB of RAM and 32 GB of internal memory, a good camera with 5 megapixels.  The device lacks only a 3G modem, but we must understand that with it it would cost 2-3 thousand rubles more.  And bb-mobile Techno W10.1 Wi-Fi is offered for 15,490 - an adequate price for such a transformer. <br><br>  <i>Intel Inside, Core, and Intel Atom are trademarks of Intel Corporation in the United States and other countries.</i> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/391707/">https://habr.com/ru/post/391707/</a></p>
