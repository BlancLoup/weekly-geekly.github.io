As I remember, a computer club, there are a couple of ‚Äúfours‚Äù and even a new-fangled Pentium 166. Admins have fun, like children, turning the Turbo button on and off on the system unit, writing out the word LO / HI on a small screen next to the button.  Playing time is bought for parental money in minutes, sometimes it was enough to play for 7 minutes, sometimes even 15 - no one wanted to go through any game from beginning to end.  Money for travel was consistently spent on games after school, and going far to the house tempered health - in general, we had a mutually beneficial relationship with the computer club.

      And then there were these points, an additional service.  Few people understood what it is for 3D and how it is more 3d-time than simple 3d games.  One of the few games with built-in 3D support was then the Descent spacecraft, and I started to fly.  Behind me, I heard cries of onlookers - where are you flying, task in the other direction, find the yellow key, where are you again?  But I, as a child, first sat down for the game, just nykalsya from side to side, under the impression of the volume.  I was not up to the game tasks, it was interesting to just fly. <br><br>  CRT monitors came across a stalemate in development and they gradually began to be replaced by more promising LCDs.  It has been 15 years and LCD screens have caught up with CRT in terms of parameters, having a development reserve for the future.  The time has come for the second bloom of the shutter glasses technology, and warm feelings from the past have pushed me to acquire it. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b>Technology</b> <br><br>  I will not describe in detail all the details, you can easily find a lot of press reviews of these points, where the emphasis is placed on the technical part.  In short, Nvidia 3d vision is glasses, instead of glasses of which, are transparent LCD screens.  While viewing a three-dimensional image, these small screens alternately close and open.  At the same time, the monitor alternately displays an image for one eye, then for another.  Those.  each eye receives a separate image alternately.  All this happens with great frequency, invisible to the eye, and there is a feeling of being in the volumetric space. <br><br>  Hence the important requirement for the monitor.  He should be able to update the picture with a very high frequency so that his eyes do not notice the blinking.  Therefore, these glasses will work well only with a small number of monitors that are now on sale (At the time of this writing, this is the Samsung 2233RZ and VIEWSONIC VX2268wm). <br><br>  You can also connect glasses to CRT monitors that support a frequency of 100 hertz, but this is not recommended - you will most likely notice the flickering of the image and the pain in the eyes over time.  From my nvidia points, at least my eyes didn't get sick after a week of games.  And sometimes I had to play for 3-4 hours in a row.  In general, the main difference between nvivia technology and old glasses from 95 years is the ability to play almost any game and a wider range of applications.  The chromaticity has become better, much less artifacts - well, it would be strange if there has been no progress in 15 years. <br><br>  And today it is the best surround image technology.  Virtual reality helmets prohibitively low screen resolution, fast heat and high price.  Anaglyph (hereinafter the description) has an inadmissible loss of color.  3D monitors have a prohibitively low horizontal resolution.  Glasses with polarization, again, are losing their light, which is why there are two powerful projectors in imax (project at least on the moon) and a silvered screen to somehow compensate for this.  Glasses from Nvidia are also not perfect - they darken the image, as if sitting in front of the monitor in light sunglasses - but this is the best thing so far. <br><br>  <b>Application area</b> <br><br>  The technology is sharpened primarily for games.  With the help of a special driver, you can run almost any game in bulk mode - this happens automatically if there is a corresponding tick in the settings of the video card.  In some games there are problems with the sight, which comes to the fore and interferes.  In some games there are problems with shadows.  But, in general, it will be difficult for you to find a game that would look bad in volume.  Although a strategy, at least an action, even a quest. <br><br>  You can also watch voluminous photos and videos.  But there are problems, the content is still not enough, because the technology, although good, can be said to be new.  You could repeatedly see 3D movies in handouts on torrents - so, you can not watch them in most cases.  For the most part, these films are designed for viewing with colored glasses (anaglyph).  This is an old technology, the first films for which appeared still, horror of horrors, in 1922.  In this case, chromaticity certainly suffers and damages health. <br><br>  Several dozens of amateur clips, a couple of full-length movies - that's all you can see.  There is not even a single porn (at least a video), so what can I say.  But there are quite a large number of photos, because they can be taken even with one ordinary camera.  I myself have already managed to make a dozen voluminous photos and I will tell you - this is great.  You look at the photo and it seems that in the monitor there is a window into real life - I think this is the future. <br><br>  <b>Effect</b> <br><br>  And now the main thing.  What to expect?  Maybe you will play a few times and put it on the top shelf, and a friend will savor the rest of the year - I told you to play enough and throw it, the loot to the wind, that‚Äôs what you said, but no, no.  And here it is important not to overestimate the effect, because this technology of three-dimensional image will not give more than you see every day in life. <br><br>  Do you get pleasure when you wake up in the morning and look at the volumetric world with two eyes?  I think no, you take it for granted.  But I don‚Äôt even want to walk with my eyes closed, somehow uncomfortable, right?  With shutter glasses the same story.  When I first saw the nvidia test screen, I was impressed.  Having started playing for the first time, I gladly shook from side to side - as in childhood.  And what impression was the girlfriend looking in the 3D aquarium - this can be conveyed only by an uncontrollable flow of words.  In short, you will certainly be impressed.  It may even last a couple of days. <br><br>  Then it becomes commonplace, your second eye, who does not want to close.  For me, this has already happened.  Emotions of the first days will not be, but live in a different way no longer want.  But if you expect unsurpassed impressions every day and 22 thousand (points + monitor) is a serious amount for you, then you risk being disappointed. <br><br>  Thanks for attention. <br><br>  <b>Related Images</b> <br><table><tbody><tr><td> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c87/408/caa/c87408caada7b7bcf10592ac6a21674a.jpg" width="187" height="133"></a> <br>  Everything added to your desktop and surroundings </td><td> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/2cb/b05/799/2cbb05799ff06d0b0065cdcd13572993.jpg" width="200" height="133"></a> <br>  Specific for this technology glitch - ghost.
