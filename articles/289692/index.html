  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Enter IT: The risk of becoming a trainee justified</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  As part of the ‚ÄúEnter IT‚Äù rubric: answer our former trainees, current Senior Developers, answer questions, share experiences and personal stories.  It happens that not only students come to interning programs, but also accomplished developers who want to grow and develop professionally.  Today Nikolay Peganov will tell about his experience. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/3f8/778/dbc/3f8778dbcf064ad7898c031c0bac0969.png"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h6>  Background </h6><br>  For a long time I was a developer in one of the Voronezh companies, at some point I began to feel the lack of professional development, because I always had to solve monotonous tasks and apply good old technologies.  It is quite common, but at the same time, a very difficult situation for a developer in my city: for the overwhelming majority of companies in Voronezh, a developer is a kind of ‚Äúsupport staff‚Äù for management, marketing, etc. specialists who play leading roles almost in all business processes in our region.  The very few companies for which software is the main product of activity put very high demands on the candidates, my modest experience and skills were absolutely uninteresting and insufficient for them. <br><br><h6>  To be or not to be a trainee </h6><br>  I found out about DataArt internship programs quite by accident, and this seemed to me almost the only way out of my situation.  However, the decision to enter the company in the role of a trainee was very difficult: the status of a trainee and the status of a 30-year-old father of the family were very poorly placed in the heads of my spouse and parents.  Another difficulty was that, despite the ‚Äúapprenticeship‚Äù, the candidate for such a position would have to go through the same three stages of the interview (including the solution of a practical task) as the candidate for a higher position, with the only difference being that the trainee would not be evaluated so tough.

      Anyway, I ventured to come to DataArt for an open day and brought a resume.  Then everything was swift: after the interview in English, I was invited for an interview with the lead developer, where I was asked a lot of easy and not so many questions, I answered most of them correctly.  The next day came to write a small test program, which took me about four hours.  As a result of the test, I was finally offered a position as a trainee, to which I gladly agreed. <br><br><h6>  New life </h6><br>  I was lucky, and I immediately got the position of the developer in a large project.  At first, I was amazed at the variety of technologies and tools unknown to me that were used in the project.  But, besides me, a lot of guys were already working on the project, and they happily shared their knowledge and experience with me.  Soon I was able to independently solve the tasks set before me, and two months later I was congratulated on the early termination of the practice. <br><br>  I worked in this project for another two years.  During this time, I mastered all the technologies involved in it, learned and applied quite a few new ones.  In parallel, he helped other projects, studied internal English courses, met new people, conducted interviews with interns.  In this relatively short time, I gained as much experience and knowledge as I could not have been if I had stayed at my former place of work.  Not so long ago, I rose to the position of a leading developer, but I continue to study English (already on my own), master unfamiliar technologies and languages, while studying internal company courses, listen to interesting and useful lectures of colleagues in the recording and live. <br><br><h6>  What came out of all this? </h6><br>  Without exaggeration, I can say that the risk of becoming an intern for me was more than justified.  I multiplied my professional knowledge, met many interesting people, learned how to quickly and technologically solve tasks.  Moreover, now I finally felt myself competitive in the market of IT developers, although this has ceased to be important for me since I got into DataArt. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/289692/">https://habr.com/ru/post/289692/</a></p>
