  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Eliminate spaces, learn Android</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  It's not about the gaps in knowledge, but more on that later. <br><br>  By old habit, I still read books on paper programming.  In particular, about the development for Android.  Several years ago, with the literature on this subject on the great and mighty was intense.  Now the situation has improved a little.  I bought and read, probably, 99% of all released books.  There are two problems with books.  The first is that they are of the same type in their mass and tell about the same thing.  The second problem is a significant delay in the release of the publication.  As a rule, the delay occurs on version 1-2, which is quite critical.  For example, when versions of Android 3.0 and 4.0 appeared with fragments, reading examples of creating applications for Android 2.3 was stupid. <br><br>  Back in 2011, the <b>Android</b> book came out <b>in 24 hours</b> , which, in my opinion, was one of the best.  I liked the approach to the disclosure of the topic - one was taken through the project and gradually became more complicated from hour to hour.  Along the way, explained the fundamental things on one project.  It was clear where and when to apply these or other opportunities. <br>  Last week, I accidentally stumbled upon a message on the Internet that a new edition had appeared with a longer title <b>Creating Android Applications in 24 hours</b> with the same authors.  And immediately <s>drank</s> bought. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  When buying, I was a little embarrassed that there was an inscription on the cover <b>of the 3rd edition</b> .  Apparently, the countdown comes from foreign publications.  Okay, let's not quibble. 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>
        <script>
          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      This time, the authors abandoned the previous approach and began to write like everyone else.  One hour, one topic, one project.  Then everything is new.  In the middle of the book, they temporarily returned to the old way, when for 4 lessons they explained new topics using the example of one project. <br><br>  Began to read.  Already by the fortieth page there were two typos: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/bfe/f46/8d9/bfef468d908a4c47914cb9d0405716da.png"><br><br>  Gone are the days when it was possible to put a "party card on the table for the same."  I talked to people who worked in publishing during the Soviet era and I know this firsthand.  Now you won't surprise anyone with misprints, and in computer literature they have met very often. <br>  But further my amazement grew more and more. <br>  My eyes were presented with a sentence written without a single space.  Immediately I remembered school German, where long words were not uncommon: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/60d/8eb/b8f/60d8ebb8ff9b4753bef9dc2371b6d4db.png"><br><br>  If you think that there was an accident, then you have another example: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/acb/117/3d8/acb1173d8a0c4b1da25364e1db4d87f1.png"><br><br>  In fact, the lack of spaces occurs constantly.  As if someone decided to save on paper and save the forest.  Sometimes, the proposal lacks one space, sometimes two.  Sometimes they do not exist as a class. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/cc1/968/940/cc1968940c4e4fb8b0441941d32fa09a.png"><br><br>  Let's leave the gaps alone for now.  Refer to the code.  By the way, the font for the code I did not like, some kind of narrow and not too readable.  But I'm not a type designer, maybe I do not understand something. <br><br>  We look at this code: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/64f/e57/2ce/64fe572ce33f40618850f91b13a8c971.png"><br><br>  How do you?  Two variables with the same name are practically near.  And the principle of the name of one character?  What a sin to conceal, I myself wrote about fifteen years ago in Visual Basic in the same style for myself.  Now this approach is justified, probably, only in js-libraries to reduce the size. <br><br>  Then the authors corrected and began to give the buttons more meaningful names.  But horseradish radish is not sweeter. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/469/d9e/a5b/469d9ea5bff74b6ea015dcb693539055.png"><br><br>  In my opinion, in all modern languages ‚Äã‚Äãthere is an unspoken rule to use verbs for function methods. <br>  But only in this case. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/cc7/9e2/195/cc79e21958d44c109fbc7997eb38db22.png"><br><br>  Formatting code without indentation (dealing with spaces, you remember): <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/83a/b7f/feb/83ab7ffeba2043af888e25dce202a80f.png"><br><br>  Okay, indents.  So removed the space between the name of the class and the variable. <br>  Accident?  I do not think. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/649/27e/3d0/64927e3d021048039ed4004b809c0faa.png"><br><br>  Error-free code is fantastic.  The programmer must not blindly copy the text. <br><br>  Again, the "successful name of the button." <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/3d5/f28/337/3d5f2833707d46e1ac587b76f5b230fd.png"><br><br>  The design of the text. <br>  Methods in Java are written in small letters.  Well, this is such a small thing.  But when Word formatted replaced them with large, Word can not be wrong (one of the versions, why it happened). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/4e9/1bf/131/4e91bf131dde442bbe407a1ac68f181c.png"><br><br>  But sometimes you can make an exception and leave one item with a small one.  Indeed, what I find fault with. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d81/f88/979/d81f88979f914c429126a97b27a85a3f.png"><br><br>  Tables are decorated with love, spaces will not pass! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/216/39a/3a4/21639a3a4eb349c4a5d2cedcb42c9452.png"><br><br>  If we steal gaps slowly, then let's populate the reader with single quotes. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/6c5/648/1a9/6c56481a92744cc7a14d5c767364577e.png"><br><br>  Surprisingly, the pages of the book are excerpts from the code, and where to see the full source code is not written anywhere.  No references in the book found.  On the website of the Russian publishing house, too.  I had to search for the website of a foreign publisher, and only there I found a link to the archive. <br><br>  On the pages of the book there was a remark that this work was written in June 2013.  Remember, I talked about lagging at the beginning of the article.  This means that here you will not find material about the Material (pun), as well as mentions about Android Studio.  Many novice developers see Eclipse and Android Studio as different and incompatible programming languages ‚Äã‚Äã(!).  I have often met such statements on forums where people refused to learn an example, if the word Eclipse met there, with the statement: ‚ÄúAfter all, everything is different there and I won‚Äôt work‚Äù. <br><br>  The book left a dual impression.  On the one hand, interesting topics are covered there using the Flickr and Facebook APIs. <br><br>  With all the parties, all of these prints are worn completely without any problem. <br><br>  Happy programming! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/250319/">https://habr.com/ru/post/250319/</a></p>
