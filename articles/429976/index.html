      <a href="https://twitter.com/kobunheat%3Flang%3Den" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow"><strong>Chris Koler</strong></a> <strong>, editor of <em>Kotaku</em> :</strong> After the release of console 64, it was fairly obvious to everyone, especially in 1997, that Sony would defeat everyone in its PlayStation.  Nintendo made some serious mistakes, for example, used cartridges instead of CD-ROM drives.  Since Nintendo had to stay with cartridges, it became important for her to release as many games as possible that could fill the market. <br><br>  In addition, for some reason, the N64 has shown itself to be much better in the United States than in Japan; therefore, there is a need for games targeted at the American audience.  It was then that Rare appeared on the scene and offered Nintendo to become its main developer a variety of games with American aesthetics, which would support Nintendo‚Äôs game library when it was absolutely necessary.  This is how the environment in which <em>GoldenEye</em> was created appeared. <br><br>  <a href="https://twitter.com/karlhilton1%3Flang%3Den" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow"><strong>Karl Hilton</strong></a> <strong>, the leading artist for the environments:</strong> In the early stages, the concept of <em>GoldenEye</em> was created by me and Martin Hollis and Bea Jones.  We went to the location of the film in Leedsden, to take pictures of everything that we could find, from props and costumes to scenery and even models with miniatures.  I took hundreds of photos on a 35 mm film ‚Äî we used them later as references for creating game graphics. <br><br>  <a href="http://goldeneye.wikia.com/wiki/Developers" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow"><strong>Mark Edmonds</strong></a> <strong>, gameplay and engine programmer:</strong> It was a terrific experience, I never got to the place where the movie was shot.  Sometimes, when we had dinner, Pierce Brosnan could go to the buffet, but we did not see a single scene in which he was filming. <br><br>  <a href="https://twitter.com/drdoak%3Flang%3Den" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow"><strong>David Dook</strong></a> <strong>, developer:</strong> At that time, there was no paradigm about what 3D games should be.  Everything had to be encoded from scratch, especially if you were creating a 3D game for such a completely new equipment, like the N64.  We programmed the engine, literally sitting with textbooks on graphics and sorting out with each step along the way.  Since we received a very general license, we were soon allowed to use everything from the Bond universe, and we collected all the data we could reach. <br><br>  <strong>Hilton:</strong> They even gave us the drawings for the film sets, so that we could plan the levels based on the real schemes from the movie.  We were also given a very early version of the screenplay, so we knew all the characters and the plot twists.  In addition, we learned about all the places abroad in which the action of the film was to take place. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/571/0a8/066/5710a8066c1f667b073f7728f68bb4a2.jpg"></div><br>  <i>An early working document of the Depot level, drawn by Carl Hilton - all notes and notes are made during the communication process of the development team.</i>  <i>(Photo courtesy of David Douk)</i> <br><br>  <strong>Mitchell K., content developer for the site dedicated to <em>GoldenEye 007</em> modding</strong> ( <a href="http://www.goldeneyevault.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow"><strong>GoldenEyeVault.com</strong></a> <strong>):</strong> Single-player models and textures very closely match the situation on the set - even the Russian-language text on the doors and barrels exactly matches the film.  From time to time I reviewed this film, after which I immediately wanted to play the game and see how they coincide. <br><br>  <strong>Douk:</strong> Very mysterious detail - in the film there was a character named Jack Wade [he was played by <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000833/%3Fref_%3Dtt_ch" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Joe Don Baker</a> ].  This is the guy who helped Bond in a difficult moment.  And this is the only character that we were forbidden to copy in the game.  This is a very insignificant part of the film, but I remembered it because we could not use it in the game: the actor did not sign the consent to the release!  This is the only character that does not appear in the project. <br><br>  <a href="https://getyarn.io/yarn-clip/ad6d3a70-79db-493a-964d-4cb16d63dfd1">- Jack Wade, CIA.</a>  <a href="https://getyarn.io/yarn-clip/ad6d3a70-79db-493a-964d-4cb16d63dfd1">- James Bond, a crazy Englishman.</a> <br><br><h4>  Game creation </h4><br>  <em>When the development team started working on Bond, Nintendo 64 was not there yet, which turned the development into a dangerous game: without knowing the limitations of 3D, the team could only guess what was possible and what was not.</em>  <em>But the developers were young and eager to show themselves, and since the N64 was released</em> after <em>the</em> GoldenEye <em>film</em> <em>, the deadline was very flexible.</em>  <em>It was the perfect combination of innovation, cheating tricks and fighting for every bit.</em>  <em>The result was a masterpiece that changed the video game industry and set many standards that are still present in modern first-person shooters.</em> <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/874/1c1/7a9/8741c17a9f258ef1a82a8452c3a544e7.jpg"></div><br>  <i>Development team <em>GoldenEye 007</em> .</i>  <i>(Photo by Bea Jones)</i> <br><br>  <strong>Doek:</strong> by modern standards, it was a tiny team - there were less than 10 of us, we were all a little less or a little more than thirty years old, many were unmarried.  Therefore, we did not have special responsibilities outside of work, which means we could spend a lot of time on it, and we did.  In the last months of development, it was usual to work 100 hours a week.  We all suffered from the impostor syndrome, so we thought we were lucky to at least work on the game.  The guys were very worried that she would not be good and that we would all disappoint. <br><br>  <strong>Hilton:</strong> For all of us, this was the first job in the gaming industry.  In fact, we were a bunch of university graduates who have more enthusiasm and ambition than real experience in game development.  We knew we wanted to create a first-person shooter, and we all enjoyed playing multiplayer games like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XPilot"><em>XPilot</em></a> , <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doom_(franchise)"><em>DOOM</em></a> , <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bomberman"><em>Bomberman</em></a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battlezone_(1980_video_game)"><em>Battle Zone</em></a> .  We spent a lot of time and money in the local hall of Sega World arcade machines, playing in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daytona_USA_(video_game)"><em>Daytona USA</em></a> and in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtua_Cop"><em>Virtua Cop</em></a> , which became the first sources of inspiration for creating <em>GoldenEye</em> . <br><br>  <strong>Douk:</strong> When we started, the final version of the N64 controller was not ready yet, so we used the hacked controller from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sega_Saturn" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Sega Saturn</a> .  We basically worked like this: ‚ÄúLet's connect several elements, see how it looks, whether the plot reflects, and whether we need to add something else.‚Äù  Then I went back to Mark Edmonds and said: ‚ÄúIf we can do this, then we can do better.‚Äù  Mark tried to experiment, and then said: "For this we do not have the tools, so it is better to redo everything from scratch." <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/6cc/b88/f92/6ccb88f92b6e5b7fc5e0b04036106527.jpg"></div><br>  <i>The Silicon Graphics Challenge XL was a million-dollar graphics machine that the developers used as a replacement for the Nintendo 64 before the release of the system.</i>  <i>(Photo by Tim Stamper)</i> <br><br>  <strong>Edmonds:</strong> Collision testing and recognition most likely came about because we initially created the game in the style of arcade <em>Virtua Cop</em> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_Crisis" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow"><em>Time Crisis</em></a> , in which aiming and getting into the right places was a crucial part of the gameplay.  Martin Hollis wrote a collision check code, and then I took it and tried to remake it so that they could check and hit when shooting.  Then I added characters and other props, for example, boxes, cubic hitboxes to limbs so that they could really shoot at them and destroy them. <br><br>  <strong>Douk:</strong> It was a very organic process - we had a gameplay scheme, but I saw it only in 2015!  There was no one design document that everyone had to strictly follow.  If someone had an idea, and it was appropriate to implement it, then we added it.  We created different aspects, played the game and looked for problems.  It was a very iterative process.  For example, all the minor characters in the game are actually Rare employees and members of our development team.  I first put myself in the role of Dr. Doke, a <a href="https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/goldeneye/images/8/83/Doak.png/revision/latest%3Fcb%3D20080510031729" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">scientist and double agent at the Facility level</a> , just as a joke.  But then the team realized that this was done simply, that is why we did so further. <br><br>  <strong>Edmonds:</strong> During initial testing, huge clots of rendered blood were sprayed out of enemies when hit.  Therefore, then this effect was slightly smoothed, replacing it with brief flashes of red.  We were worried about whether it would be possible to preserve red marks on the enemies in the places of impact, but, fortunately, no one cut them out.  Attempts were also made to add the feeling that in reality everything was ‚Äúpretend‚Äù, all the people the player shoots are not real, they don‚Äôt die, they are just characters in a video game! <br><br>  <strong>Hilton:</strong> Yes, Nintendo of Japan was worried about the number of killings in the game, and they offered to remind players that Bond is a fictional character and he is taken from the film.  [Earlier, Martin Hollis told the <em>Guardian</em> that there was even an idea <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/oct/26/goldeneye-james-bond-n64-nintendo-shigeru-miyamoto-gamecity" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">for Bond to go to the hospital so that he could shake hands with all the people he shot</a> .] It was definitely not like the standard Nintendo-style game for the N64 console.  It seems that management was aware that the console game market was growing up, and for Nintendo this was part of the growth process.  Our game has become a counterweight to the games about Mario! <br><br>  <strong>Edmonds:</strong> In addition, it was important for us to get a Teen rating so that as many people as possible could buy the game. <br><br>  <strong>Douk:</strong> We had an idea that no one took seriously: there was a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendo_64_controller" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">slot</a> on the N64 controllers, and everyone wanted to use some kind of additional equipment in it.  So I suggested: ‚ÄúCan we use it in <em>GoldenEye</em> ?‚Äù Movies were our only source of knowledge about weapons, so someone suggested, ‚ÄúWhat if we plug in the recharge piece?‚Äù So that the game recognizes when it is connected.  But when we tested the recharge, it turned out to be nonsense, so we refused it, and it all turned into a big joke. <br><br><h4>  Legendary multiplayer (which could not be) </h4><br>  <em>The multiplayer mode GoldenEye 007 was one of many ideas that would not have been realized if everything went according to the original schedule with the release of Nintendo 64 and the film.</em>  <em>Most first-person shooters were only single-player games, and it was expected that</em> GoldenEye 007 <em>would follow this tradition.</em>  <em>But when the developers learned that the console would have four connectors for the controllers, they became interested in how a multiplayer mode could look like: without saying anything to Nintendo, they created their own.</em>  <em>The longer they worked it out (read: they played it), the better it got.</em> <br><br>  <em>Right before the release of the game, the team decided to show it to its management and Nintendo: as they say, everything else went down in history - the players were cut into multiplayer for hours, so keen on them that the</em> GoldenEye 007 <em>cartridges</em> <em>nearly melted in consoles.</em> <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d5a/452/225/d5a4522256611ef6b58519d7348c84a7.jpg"></div><br>  <i>Early sketch level dam.</i>  <i>(Photo by David Doke)</i> <br><br>  <strong>Kohler:</strong> At that time, we had to concentrate on the single-player mode, because it was people who played consoles in it.  Consoles usually had two connectors for the controllers, but Nintendo 64 changed the situation, making the standard four connectors.  This made it possible to arrange parties for four people without buying additional equipment, so developers were more likely to add four-player functionality to games. <br><br>  <strong>Douk: The</strong> multiplayer mode, which is now considered a necessary condition for serious success, has been on the wish list for a long time, but we were not sure that we would implement it.  The N64 had four controller connectors, that is, it supported the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãsplit-screen for four players, but we were only going to write the multiplayer code if we had time. <br><br>  <strong>Edmonds:</strong> I remember how I wrote the code to work by dividing the screen into four players even before we were given permission to add a multiplayer mode.  Therefore, when it would be decided whether multiplayer is needed, I could say: ‚ÄúWell, we already have a working split screen mode - it would be a pity not to use it!‚Äù <br><br>  <strong>Douk:</strong> Another programmer, Steve Ellis, finished work on the main game, and Martin told him: "So, you and Duncan finished, we still have three or four months, see if you can create multiplayer before deadline ..." We always knew that it would be difficult, and they set to work as a tiny team of two people. <br><br>  <strong>Edmonds:</strong> We already created a simple demo mode, and it was interesting.  Therefore, we all decided that it was necessary to turn it into a real part of the game with different modes, leaderboards and the like.  I don‚Äôt think that I perceived it as a revolutionary innovation, but we all liked to play it ourselves, and we enjoyed developing it.  That was enough. <br><br>  <strong>Douk:</strong> When we finally told the management and Nintendo about it, they were very impressed. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/bde/9a4/65c/bde9a465c6f6f976910c191db94088c1.jpg"></div><br>  <i>The design of the "front-end" - the screen on which players save files and choose the game.</i>  <i>According to Douk, he was ‚Äúassembled in a hurry at the end of development‚Äù.</i>  <i>(Image courtesy of Martin Hollis)</i> <br><br>  <strong>Hilton:</strong> Personally, I always liked the <a href="http://goldeneye.wikia.com/wiki/Golden_Gun" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Golden Gun</a> at the <a href="http://goldeneye.wikia.com/wiki/Complex" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Complex</a> level, partly because I loved the speed and accuracy needed for the Golden Gun, partly because Complex was one of my levels, and I really liked its structure.  I added ‚Äúcheat‚Äù invisible cubic holes in the Complex, and for several days I did not tell about them to other team members.  I did it only to win, and not a bit sorry about it. <br><br>  <strong>Edmonds:</strong> Different people have different preferences, but personally I like <a href="http://goldeneye.wikia.com/wiki/Grenade_Launcher" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">grenade launchers</a> at the <a href="http://goldeneye.wikia.com/wiki/Temple" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Temple</a> level, or at any other level.  There is nothing better than to blow someone away or from around the corner.  And the melee with a grenade launcher turns into a real mess! <br><br>  <strong>Mitchell K .:</strong> I play multiplayer for <a href="http://goldeneye.wikia.com/wiki/Xenia_Onatopp" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Xenia</a> , because in the film it was an interesting character.  My favorite multiplayer level is <a href="http://goldeneye.wikia.com/wiki/Basement" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">basement</a> , <a href="http://goldeneye.wikia.com/wiki/License_to_Kill" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">License to Kill</a> , or the two against two fight with the Golden Gun at <a href="http://goldeneye.wikia.com/wiki/Facility" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Facility</a> level. <br><br>  License to Kill, Basement, Pistols: There is nothing better than this! <br><br><h4>  Detmatch for all Bonds </h4><br>  <em>Among the fans of the Bond film series, disputes often arise about which of the Bond is better: Roger Moore, Sean Connery, Pierce Brosnan, Timothy Dalton or (for true rebels) George Lazenby?</em>  <em>(Do not forget that the game went out for a good nine years before muscled Daniel Craig started playing the character.) With such a broad license for Bond‚Äôs universe, the development team wondered why not use this situation for the benefit of</em> GoldenEye 007 <em>, sticking everything into the game previous bonds?</em> <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/efc/c74/014/efcc74014110cd4a50cd343797bc7f2e.jpg"></div><br>  <i>A fan-made concept of what the de-match of ‚ÄúBonds against Bond‚Äù would look like - unfortunately, this opportunity never got to the release of the game.</i> <br><br>  <strong>Hilton:</strong> We worked, understanding that we could use anything from the Bond universe, so for most of the multiplayer content, we went through previous films. <br><br>  <strong>Douk:</strong> That's why <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oddjob" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Oddjob (Ojobb)</a> [who originally appeared in the 1964 <em>Goldfinger</em> movie] was in the game!  People constantly ask me how he got into the game;  in films he was short, so he remained the same in the game.  But besides the other characters, it seemed natural for us that the player could play for any of the Bonds (more precisely, we chose four): Connery, Moore, Dalton and Brosnan.  The idea was to play for them in multiplayer, as for unlockable characters.  And we liked the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãpassing the game a second or third time for Roger Moore or Sean Connery.  The player would see them only in the cutscenes. <br><br>  But it was already quite late - because when MGM studio leaders came to us, I worked on the Aztec level with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_henchmen_of_James_Bond_villains" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Baron Samedi</a> [who first appeared in the 1973 <em>Live and Let Die</em> film].  They really liked the presence of Samedi, because he was a landmark character.  Therefore, we showed them that we have all the Bonds ... Soon we received a notice that there <em>could not</em> be all the Bonds in the game, because only <em>GoldenEye</em> actors signed the consent to use images in the games. <br><br>  <strong>Edmonds:</strong> Therefore, to put Sean Connery, Roger Moore or Timothy Dalton into the game, we would have to contact each of their agents to obtain rights.  Unfortunately, it turned out to be very expensive. <br><br>  <strong>Douk:</strong> They especially stressed that Connery would want money, and if Connery received it, others would also want money.  Therefore, they were removed from the game. <br><br>  <strong>Edmonds:</strong> Nintendo's legal department was also worried about possible lawsuits from various weapons manufacturers.

In addition, I heard that local </font></font><em><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">GoldenEye</font></font></em><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> tournaments are taking place so far </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">, in which users of our site participate. </font></font><br><br> <strong><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Edmonds:</font></font></strong><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> I saw some high-speed videos, and I am glad that people continue to play the game and improve on it. It‚Äôs like a record score in classic games like </font></font><em><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Space Invaders</font></font></em><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> or </font></font><em><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Pac Man</font></font></em><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> . </font></font><br><br> <strong><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Dok:</font></font></strong><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The community of speedrunners found absolutely all the glitches of the game! For example, with control, you can move forward or stretch, but the speed runners found that if you move at an angle of 45 degrees, you can </font></font><a href="https://speedrunwiki.com/Speed_strafing" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">increase the maximum speed 1.4 times</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> . So speedrunners are now constantly moving diagonally! In addition, you can see that in most passages they </font></font><a href="https://speedrunwiki.com/Lookdown" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">look to the floor</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> - when you look down, the world around you is not rendered, so the game runs a little faster. </font></font><br><br> <strong><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Clark:</font></font></strong><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In short, the principle of speedrunning - Finish the level (or game) as quickly as possible. If there are ways to cut, use them, if there are glitches / exploits - use them. Modern speed runners believe that the process of passing the game begins with pressing the ‚Äústart‚Äù button and ends with the appearance of captions. However, the high-speed passage of </font></font><em><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">GoldenEye</font></font></em><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> on certain levels was popular since the very release of the game. </font></font><br><br> <strong><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Douk:</font></font></strong><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> We inadvertently invented speedrunning from the very beginning, because in the game it was possible to unlock functions by passing it for a certain time. </font></font><br><br> <strong><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Clark:</font></font></strong><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Having completed the level faster than within the specified time, it was possible to unlock the cheat. The more difficult it is to overtake this time, the more steep the cheat mode turned out to be: turbo mode, invisible Bond, invulnerability, unlimited ammunition - in fact, it is possible to turn on god mode, study the game in an unimaginable way. Personally, my addiction was precisely the difficulty: it was a very dynamic game for speedrunning, and time constraints were a clear incentive to show my skill. Passing the Facility on the level of complexity 00 Agent for 2:05 was the legendary measure of skill. The site </font></font><a href="http://the-elite.net/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The-elite.net</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> , which became the home for speeding up </font></font><em><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">GoldenEye</font></font></em><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> , has been </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">setting </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">records since 1998. It is noteworthy that today the game has more active speed runners than at any other time in the past. </font></font><br><br> <strong><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Dok:</font></font></strong><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In this community, </font></font><em><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">GoldenEye</font></font></em><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> is still one of the main games. It is phenomenal how </font></font><em><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">GoldenEye has</font></font></em><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> outlived its intended lifespan. </font></font><br><br> <strong><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Kohler:</font></font></strong><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> I do not think it makes sense to do a remake of the game and level design - just taking it and repainting it would be strange. However, if Nintendo decided to release the Nintendo 64 Classic, as it did last year with SNES Classic, which cost $ 80, it would be logical to add the original version of </font></font><em><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">GoldenEye to it</font></font></em><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">to let the people who played it then play again. In all other respects, this game is a product of its time, a beautiful moment in the history of video games, which can hardly be repeated. To be frank, in the modern world it would not stand the competition. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The problem is that Nintendo has never created anything as good as </font></font><em><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">GoldenEye</font></font></em><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> . Nintendo decided to sell its stake in Microsoft's Rare, and in fact it could have released </font></font><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GameCube" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Gamecube</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> along with an FPS shooter that could attract an audience of </font></font><em><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">GoldenEye</font></font></em><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> . But everyone who played </font></font><em><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">GoldenEye</font></font></em><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> switched to the Xbox for </font></font><em><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Halo</font></font></em><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> . Looking back, we can say that if </font></font><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfect_Dark" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow"><em><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Perfect Dark</font></font></em></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">[created by the same development team] was transferred to the GameCube, released on the same day as the console, </font></font><em><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Perfect Dark</font></font></em><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> could compete with </font></font><em><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Halo</font></font></em><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> , and then who knows? </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The gaming industry could look completely different if they made this move. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">But they did not, and therefore </font></font><em><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">GoldenEye</font></font></em><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> remained the only one of its kind.</font></font></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/429976/">https://habr.com/ru/post/429976/</a></p>
