  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How does Adobe bring disassembly from Apple to court?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Strong passions flare up between Apple and Adobe - two companies, hand in hand that were marching towards success not only in the American, but also in the global IT market. <br>  The company Apple, recently again turned the head to its fans, the brand new iPad, is trying its best to move the development of Adobe from its new iGadgets.  Sources close to Adobe claim that the company is preparing lawsuits against its recent partner. <br><img align="left" hspace="10" src="http://blog.alkalineinteractive.com/uploaded_images/applevsadobe-733860.jpg" alt="image"><br>  Adobe's insult can be understood if we recall the unambiguous statement that its product (Adobe Flash) is <a href="http://www.tgdaily.com/software-features/49374-report-adobe-to-sue-apple-over-flash-ban">not good enough to be present in the list of programs available for the iPad</a> .  But the last straw was an updated license agreement under which developers using cross-platform compilers will not receive Apple approval and as a result - access to the AppleStore.  Well, sad.  As it may seem to some, such actions monopolize the market, not allowing the product to develop ... But who said it would be easy? <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>  Adobe doesn‚Äôt comment on this, but there‚Äôs no doubt that the company is already counting the days allotted by Apple until the first court session.  How often does one company blame former business partners ?!  ‚ÄúGo screw yourself Apple,‚Äù said Lee Brimelow, an avid fan of Adobe, on his <a href="http://theflashblog.com/%3Fp%3D1888">Flash blog</a> .  After Adobe asked him to explain or completely abandon his words. <br><br><blockquote>  <i>‚ÄúIt‚Äôs my own way and that‚Äù</i> <i><br></i>  <i>- Adobe asked me to clarify the situation on this statement, since it does not reflect the official position of the company and is purely my personal opinion.</i> <i><br></i> </blockquote>

      I think that in the offices of the company audible statements are much more piquant and sharper about Apple and its relationship to Flash. <br>  <a href="http://www.computerworld.com/s/article/9175157/Apple_blocks_Adobe_s_iPhone_end_around_plans">Adobe's press officer, Wiebke Lips,</a> said: <br><br><blockquote>  <i>‚ÄúWe are aware of the new language and are looking into it.</i>  <i>We continue to develop our Packager for iPhone OS technology. ‚Äù</i> <i><br></i>  <i>- We know about the new SDK and continue to study it.</i>  <i>We are also continuing to develop Packager for the iPhone OS, which we plan to include in Flash CS5.</i> <i><br></i> </blockquote><br><br>  Flash CS5, which in turn is part of <a href="http://www.computerworld.com/s/article/9175320/Adobe_Creative_Suite_5_expands_and_extends_its_graphic_reach">Adobe Creative Suite 5</a> , went on sale on April 12, but unfortunately cannot be used to create applications for i-devices. <br><br>  Changes in the license agreement were most likely aimed at preventing cross-platform technologies such as <a href="http://labs.adobe.com/technologies/flashcs5/appsfor_iphone">Adobe's Flash-to-iPhone compiler</a> , which could hold Apple as a monopolist in the market.  It is especially sad that this was done on the eve of the release of Flash CS5.  The same goes for development for the Mono platform in C #. <br>  In other words, Adobe and Microsoft can forget about the hardware support of their Flash and <a href="http://www.silverlight.net/">Silverlight</a> technologies for the iPhone, iPad and iPod touch.  Is it always on?  I think it is unlikely ... but so far Apple is feeling strong and can "fight off" competitors. <br><br>  But not only Adobe has suffered the fate of being blocked for the new and so popular market by Apple‚Äôs mobile solutions.  <a href="http://www.mono-project.com/newstouch/archive/2010/Apr-09.html">Novell's MonoTouch group is</a> also asking for clarification from the phone manufacturer and hopes to have the issue resolved soon before the release of its SDK 4.0 <br>  Perhaps Adobe is best to remain optimistic and believe that Apple will still allow them to its operating system and at the same time give a piece of tasty cake - the iPad market. <br><br>  In other words, if in the next few weeks the situation does not change, then we will probably see Adobe and Apple in court. <br><br><h1>  And what can Adobe do to make Apple give up? </h1><br><br>  It‚Äôs no secret that these two companies <a href="http://www.storyphoto.com/multimedia/multimedia_photoshop.html">helped each other very much</a> in their time.  Popularity MacOS added and Photoshop, and other products from Adobe.  But over time, the company Adobe began to release its new version of the editor for Windows OS earlier than Apple's pride hurt much. <br><img src="http://www.9to5mac.com/files/u3/AdobeBoss.jpg" alt="image"><br>  On the other hand, the company has been developing its product for several years in order to get a ban on using its main ‚Äúchip‚Äù - iPhone support three days before the release?  Who would like this attitude ?!  Probably should have warned in advance about such things to your partner.  But surely there were already agreements, otherwise Adobe would simply not have started developing a converter for ipad until it resolved all legal issues.  Apparently, Adobe decided it was enough.  Have suffered. <br>  But, whatever path I choose to dig, it will not be easy for her. <br>  There is an opinion expressed by Thomas Carey, a representative of one of the business elite groups, that they can file a lawsuit on the basis of antitrust laws, saying Apple has great power in the smartphone and tablet PC market, which prevents Adobe from competing in the markets and it has no rational explanation. <br>  But whichever way you choose to dig, it will be oh, how easy it is for her ... <br><br>  <i>Let me remind you that Apple recently approved Opera for the iPhone.</i>  <i>This is a ‚Äúnon-native‚Äù browser, which is now available for the mobile platform through the Apple Store.</i>  <i>The development company was also ready to start suing Apple with the same antitrust claims.</i> <br></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/91065/">https://habr.com/ru/post/91065/</a></p>
