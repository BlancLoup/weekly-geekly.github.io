    <a name="habracut"></a><br>  Understanding this fact and all the possibilities that it gives IPTV, and pushed me to write this article.  IPTV gives the user such opportunities that simple television, for example, adaptive broadcasting, high quality video and sound (up to HD resolution), interactivity (the ability to watch TV programs at a convenient time, and on any device), pause live .  And of course, if there is such a ‚Äúcream‚Äù when watching TV, they should definitely be tested.  With the current prevalence of IPTV, the user already has a choice of players to watch IPTV broadcasts.  And in this article I want to give a small overview (this is even more a comparison than a full review) of IPTV players in Russia. <br><br>  I will begin my review with a popular program for watching TV channels on mobile devices - <b>SPB TV</b> .  It immediately suggests itself, to note one drawback - viewing only on mobile devices.  But first, let's talk about the pros.  The main plus, of course, is multiplatform.  The player works on all platforms, among them: iOS, Android, Windows Phone, Symbian or Blackberry.  The player is also suitable for Smart TV - this is quite relevant today.  If we talk about the proposed content, there are about 200 channels on SPB TV, while there are both free and paid subscriptions, while the creators claim that their prices are lower than the prices for ordinary home television. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/3ac/e9e/0b3/3ace9e0b3fc47134e3bb8c5ee9fb9117.png" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>SPB TV in all its glory</b> <br><br>  The offered channels are both Russian and foreign.  And all these advantages come to the user for free.  The listed advantages of the player are noted by the creators on their site, what can be said about the disadvantages.  First, there are significant problems with updating the program, understanding the user's needs.  After the latest program updates, there are significant problems with playing channels, many channels have disappeared, many do not work at all.  Not very user-friendly interface, no brightness adjustment.  Of course, after user complaints, developers should correct these shortcomings, but as long as it is, this is a significant drawback of the program.  Often there are problems with viewing Russian channels abroad. <br><br>  The next mobile TV you want to consider is <b>Crystal TV</b> - ‚Äúthis is a TV for your mobile phone, tablet or laptop‚Äù.  Supported platforms iOS, Android, Windows, Mac OS X, Windows Phone, Symbian.  Here, an advantage over SPB TV is immediately apparent, and this advantage is the ability to watch TV channels via Crystal TV on a computer.  Compared with the previous service, there are fewer TV channels to watch, but all the most popular channels of on-air broadcasting are available (there are 32 TV channels in the basic package, there is no NTV, Ren TV, TNT, TVC).  The biggest disadvantage is the paid distribution of the program. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/153/3e4/ede/1533e4ede35e50d123e97127216eb379.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>Crystal TV discovered it not long ago, and struck his quick work</b> <br><br>  In general, the service is simple to use, there is a picture-in-picture function.  A huge disadvantage is a very small number of free channels (about 4), even those channels that a regular antenna catches are locked up here.  But good video quality, because the program can adapt to the width of the user‚Äôs Internet access channel and broadcast video of the appropriate quality, which is important, and there is a picture-in-picture function.  In general, if you don‚Äôt feel sorry for the money to pay for a service that can be provided completely free of charge, then install and enjoy the show. <br><br>  <b><a href="http://telebreeze.com/player">Telebreeze Player</a></b> .  Supports the most popular platforms: Windows, Linux, MacOS, Android, iOS.  It also highlights the plus that the program can work on both PCs and mobile devices.  But compared with the previous programs reviewed is not suitable for Windows Phone.  This, of course, is a competitive disadvantage of the player. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/319/41d/761/31941d761e006d0bb790f9cdf83909e5.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>Telebreeze Player + Peer-to-Peer = Best combination for enjoy</b> <br><br>  The service has 15 TV channels in free access, on various topics.  The advantages of the player can provide a convenient, beautiful appearance, the ability to play video from the archive.  A special advantage of the player is broadcasting on a peer-to-peer system.  In this case, the quality of the video playback is not particularly affected by the speed of the Internet provider, so you can easily enjoy watching your favorite channel.  Also, the creators use the technology of adaptive broadcasting, which also significantly improves the quality of picture playback. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f78/4d0/474/f784d047434b011052236f6eb57677ad.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>RusTV Player</b> .  In its arsenal has more than 300 Russian and foreign TV channels.  A significant drawback of the program in supported platforms is Windows 7 / Vista / XP, the program is suitable only for PCs.  Here, the developers took care of the design, the program contains about 60 themes.  Also in the presence of 33 radio stations, the creators delight diversity.  Very simple and convenient interface, but the program is significantly inferior in quality of video playback, a large number of failures when launching and watching TV channels. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/2c7/020/199/2c7020199a0274377d9092218a3b0371.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>Rus TV Player for me does not differ in creative and user-friendly interface</b> <br><br>  As a result of this ‚Äúmini‚Äù review, I make a table where the characteristics of the reviewed programs, their differences and common features are clearly visible. <br><table><tbody><tr><td>  Criterion </td><th>  SPB TV </th><th>  Crystal tv </th><th>  Telebreeze player </th><th>  RusTV Player </th></tr><tr><td>  Total number of TV channels </td><td>  About 200 </td><td>  About 60 </td><td>  15 </td><td>  More than 300 </td></tr><tr><td>  The number of channels freely available </td><td>  39 </td><td>  32 </td><td>  15 </td><td>  More than 300 </td></tr><tr><td>  Supported Platforms </td><td>  iOS, Android, Windows Phone, Symbian, Blackberry </td><td>  iOS, Android, Windows, Mac OS X, Windows Phone, Symbian </td><td>  Windows, Linux, MacOS, Android, iOS, Smart TV </td><td>  Windows 7 / Vista / XP </td></tr><tr><td>  Cost of use </td><td>  Is free </td><td>  Is free </td><td>  Is free </td><td>  Is free </td></tr><tr><td>  Full screen mode </td><td>  + </td><td>  + </td><td>  + </td><td>  + </td></tr><tr><td>  Picture in Picture function </td><td>  + </td><td>  + </td><td>  - </td><td>  - </td></tr><tr><td>  The ability to play video from the archive </td><td>  - </td><td>  + </td><td>  + </td><td>  + </td></tr><tr><td>  Adaptive Broadcast </td><td>  + </td><td>  - </td><td>  + </td><td>  - </td></tr><tr><td>  The ability to sort the channels </td><td>  + </td><td>  + </td><td>  + </td><td>  + </td></tr><tr><td>  Use peering </td><td>  - </td><td>  - </td><td>  + </td><td>  - </td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/206880/">https://habr.com/ru/post/206880/</a></p>
