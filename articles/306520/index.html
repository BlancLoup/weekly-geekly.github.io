Another classmate for pivas told it already in his company of friends, and those without his knowledge decided to play tricks.

This is <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/post/226513/">where SSD fed petabytes</a> , he did not choke, but you can feed him himself to a shredder, as they do in Europe and America.  Our engineers came up with a more elegant solution.  But not at once.  At first there was agile agile, several iterations of testing destruction technologies.  Before coming to the ideal option of destroying an SSD, there were flames and explosions. <br><br>  When the saws are knocking on the door, there is no time to hammer in everything with zeros or to unscrew the disk from the body and to push it in the microwave.  Although the drill on the desktop will help.  The main thing that was always with a charged battery, because the <s>secret service</s> attackers can de-energize the building. <br><br>  Several photos and video and test options for destroyers, as well as standards for the protection of information from unauthorized access. <br><cut><br><h2>  Theory </h2><br>  Guidance document "Protection against unauthorized access to information."  <a href="http://fstec.ru/component/attachments/download/298">Terms and definitions</a> . <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">American national standard DoD 5220.22-M</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  It is based on one of the oldest algorithms for guaranteed destruction of information.  DoD 5220.22-M was adopted in 1995 for use in the US Army.  By the way, it was from here that the abbreviation DoD - the Department of Defense (Ministry of Defense) - took the title of the standard. <br><br>  The DoD 5220.22-M standard involves making three recording passes on top of the deleted information and one verification cycle.  In the first of them, randomly selected characters are stored in each byte of each sector.  The second pass is recording the inverted data.  That is, units are written instead of all zeros and vice versa.  And finally, the third cycle is another entry of a random sequence of characters. <br><br>  This approach is a good defense against people who do not have special tools.  Nevertheless, in many cases, its application will not be enough.  This is recognized by the US Army, whose headquarters prohibits the use of DoD 5220.22-M to delete information with the ‚ÄúTop Secret‚Äù stamp. <br><br>  <a href="http://pcsupport.about.com/od/termsd/g/dod-5220-22-M.htm">pcsupport.about.com/od/termsd/g/dod-5220-22-M.htm</a> <br></div></div><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">German national standard VSITR</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  This standard was developed in 1999 by the organization Bundesamt fuer Sicherheit in der Information-stechnik, performing in Germany many of the duties of our former FAPSI.  Compared to the US DoD 5220.22-M, it is more reliable.  This is achieved through the implementation of seven recording cycles over the destroyed information.  True, there is no originality in it.  The first cycle is the recording of all logical zeros (0x00), the second - ones (0xFF).  The next four passes repeat the first two.  And on the seventh, the last ‚Äúlap‚Äù, the value 0xAA is recorded. <br><br>  Naturally, this algorithm of guaranteed destruction of information takes longer than the US DoD 5220.22-M.  And although it is better in terms of reliability, it does not guarantee the absolute impossibility of data recovery. <br></div></div><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Russian national standard GOST R50739-95</b> <div class="spoiler_text"> This standard, as its name implies, was developed in 1995.  It is based on the ‚Äúsoftest‚Äù algorithm, which, although it protects against data recovery using ordinary programs, provides absolutely no protection against special tools.  The standard provides two options for data destruction.  The first one is for computer systems from the 6th to the 4th grade of protection.  It provides for writing logical zeros to each byte of each sector.  The second option is used for computer systems from the 3rd to the 1st class of protection.  In this case, randomly selected characters are written instead of zeros. <br><br>  <a href="http://protect.gost.ru/v.aspx%3Fcontrol%3D8%26baseC%3D-1%26page%3D0%26month%3D-1%26year%3D-1%26search%3D%26RegNum%3D1%26DocOnPageCount%3D15%26id%3D126373">GOST P 50739-95 Computing facilities.</a>  <a href="http://protect.gost.ru/v.aspx%3Fcontrol%3D8%26baseC%3D-1%26page%3D0%26month%3D-1%26year%3D-1%26search%3D%26RegNum%3D1%26DocOnPageCount%3D15%26id%3D126373">Protection against unauthorized access to information.</a>  <a href="http://protect.gost.ru/v.aspx%3Fcontrol%3D8%26baseC%3D-1%26page%3D0%26month%3D-1%26year%3D-1%26search%3D%26RegNum%3D1%26DocOnPageCount%3D15%26id%3D126373">General technical requirements</a> <br></div></div><br><br><h4>  Hardware data destruction </h4><br>  According to the Pentagon, software does not guarantee absolutely reliable data deletion.

The interface of the disk does not matter.  At the same time, speed and functionality of the disks are fully preserved.  Before being placed in the device, the external case should be removed from the disk, that is, the disk board itself should be placed in the device without a protective casing.  This operation may be performed by medium-level IT personnel familiar with the instruction. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f93/c1e/e25/f93c1ee25c0945a88e79cb745a008283.jpg"><br>  <i>Knitting "red buttons" to destroy information.</i> <br><br>  Peripherals allow remote (including wireless) control of the device, organization of perimeter protection of the computer case, premises. <br><br>  Local device activation - wired buttons up to 300m. <br><br>  Remote activation - a radio channel (range 40, 1000m), a GSM controller with the additional possibility of receiving feedback on the activation and status of the device. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/aca/d31/539/acad31539f3b4585bf40252da44b8b8f.jpg"><br>  <i>Blocks radio channel short and medium range.</i> <br><br>  Perimeter protection - mechanical, reed sensors, security control - contactless keys. <br><br>  I wasn‚Äôt allowed to climb inside the device, only ‚Äúmotors‚Äù showed. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/282/3f7/ae4/2823f7ae4fe546a1a84b23982815a050.jpg"><br>  <i>Such simple motors provide sweep across the entire area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe SSD drive.</i> <br><br><h2>  Protection from the fool and cleaners </h2><br>  When all hard drives can be destroyed at the touch of a button, it‚Äôs worth thinking ‚Äúfool-proof‚Äù protection.  Our engineers have proposed a solution - a kind of ‚Äúpressure pattern‚Äù (such as the cunning knock on the door: pam-pababampamp-pam-pam).  But once the "fool" managed to circumvent the protection from himself and he decided to fight with a colleague.  There was an activation of the destruction of disks.  At first they wanted to blame the spontaneous operation of the device, but there are logs.  When the logs were raised, there was an obvious triggering of the radio launch and our hero confessed to bypass the defenses. <br><br><h2>  Conclusion </h2><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pgYKbfBkK8k" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><blockquote>  ‚ÄúWe are increasingly turning to the company for destruction systems on solid-state media.  SSD media, apparently becoming cheaper, more often used in the assembly of workstations and servers.  I am an expert in the information security market for 5 (10 years), during which time I have rechecked several dozen variants of destroyers and boldly declare that Ipulse-SSD provides the maximum destruction of carriers from all existing options.

It is important that it works guaranteed (especially in situations with power cuts and radio broadcast jamming) and precisely when ordered (and not arbitrarily).  It follows from this that it is worth checking the reliability of the destruction system several times in the ‚Äútraining alert‚Äù mode and not to trust the ‚Äúmarketing assurances‚Äù. <br><br><h2>  PS </h2><br>  Again I want to remind you about ‚ÄúGenius‚Äù: <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dkFxpCyfxJw" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><h2>  Pps </h2><br>  Somehow it happened that my classmate was forgotten to say that he was pinned over him.
