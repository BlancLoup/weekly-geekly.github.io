  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Yandex.Start together with inCube Business Incubator and GreenfieldProject</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  On December 16, an open day, Yandex.Start, was held at the Yandex office with the support of GreenfieldProject and the InCube business incubator ANKH.  This is a closed event for representatives of ‚ÄúYandex‚Äù and start-ups.  Of the 70 applications reviewed, only 6 projects were able to present their ideas to the experts. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  In early 2010, Yandex announced its interest in teams developing new technologies, applications and services, including web, desktop and mobile solutions.  This is the second Yandex.Start, the first was held in September of this year. <br><br>  The InCube Business Incubator of the Academy of National Economy and the GreenfieldProject company conducted a preliminary selection of projects for this event.  The organizers focused on startups that fit the company's vision, ideas for the development of new services. <br><br>  Yandex.Start aims to help grow further those who stand out at the general level.  We understand that a lot of interesting things happen outside, and not just inside our company.  We carefully screen out projects, and thanks to GreenfieldProject and the InCube business incubator, we have selected high-quality start-ups, ‚Äùcomments Grigory Bakunov, deputy head of the development department at Yandex.

      The finalists were the following projects: Speaktoit.com - virtual digital assistant, ‚Äúspeaking‚Äù personal assistant for smartphones;  Color Pen is a service for interactive learning via the Internet;  UNICA Parking - technology for paying and booking parking through an application for smartphones;  3DBank - a bank of 3D-models for business and not only, as well as the creation of 3D-models of objects on request;  Geo-counter - a service for collecting information on the movement of people;  Online Tours - service for the selection and booking of tours. <br><br>  ‚ÄúGoing to Yandex.Start, I wanted to get, first of all, an expert assessment from the company's specialists.  I heard specific questions that we are already working on.  I do not know how the conversation will develop in the future, but at least they have learned about us.  Now the project is at a stage where feedback is most important to us, ‚ÄùIlya Gelfenbein, CEO Speaktoit.com, resident of the InCube business incubator, shares his impressions of participation in the Yandex Open Day. <br><br>  ‚ÄúYandex is our infrastructure partner,‚Äù comments Alexey Komissarov, head of the InCube business incubator.  - We are happy to support colleagues in holding Yandex.Start open day., Because this is a common cause to develop innovative projects and entrepreneurship.  The more such initiatives are implemented, the better.  This gives young entrepreneurs a chance to become even more active and successful. ‚Äù <br><br>  Renat Garipov, one of the founders of the GreenfiledProject company, which specializes in the development of technological entrepreneurship, noted that the interest of large companies in Russia to this subject is still very rare, so they were pleased to participate in the organization of this project. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/110857/">https://habr.com/ru/post/110857/</a></p>
