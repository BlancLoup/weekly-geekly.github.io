  <section class="page js-page"><h1>DevOps on the edge of the universe</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  To understand how the Universe, fish and DevOps are connected, you need to study the schedule of DevOpsConf Russia.  Moreover, the conference is already a week later, on October 1-2, and so and so it is necessary to plan which of the speeches can be heard.  I will try to help with this - after all, I put a lot of effort into making the program so intense. <br><br>  I will open the conference with the topic ‚ÄúWhat is DevOps‚Äù.  <a href="https://devopsconf.io/moscow/2018/abstracts/4322">I'll tell you</a> how to go to him, and what he is all about, I hope this will give rise to disputes and conversations throughout the conference.  I will touch on the processes, engineering and infrastructure issues, that is, all the building blocks that make up the DevOps program.  And after that let us take up the instruments: Kubernetes, Ansible, Docker, Prometheus, Ceph, Hashicorp Vault, Istio, KVM, CoreOS. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/1z/og/mx/1zogmxcpsoxprmlvxhcbnf-bmna.jpeg">

      All reports and abstracts for them are collected <a href="https://devopsconf.io/moscow/2018/abstracts/">here</a> , we will not dwell on everyone in this review, but only on some, which reflect the diversity of our new, renamed conference RootConf.  The history of rebranding can be read <a href="https://habr.com/company/oleg-bunin/blog/418973/">here</a> . <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  October 1, Monday <br></h2><br>  On the first day, we will discuss a lot about the <strong>infrastructure platform</strong> .  These reports will be held mainly in Hall 1, ‚Äú <strong>Thank you for the fish,</strong> ‚Äù and will be especially useful to specialists who are engaged in engineering practices. <br><br>  In the second hall, entitled ‚Äú <strong>At the Edge of the Universe,</strong> ‚Äù we will discuss slightly more specific topics, such as: DevSecOps, DevOps architectures, DevOps for technical directors.  Perhaps these questions are interesting to a smaller number of our participants, but they really need them, and the reports will help everyone to solve their problems.  It is important that none of the speakers will tell you about what they have not dealt with on their own experience.  This is one of the fundamental principles of our conferences, and we are not going to move away from it. <br><br><h3>  Kubernetes for those over 30 </h3>  <font color="#808080">11:00, hall ‚ÄúThank you for the fish‚Äù</font> <br><br>  <strong>Nikolay Sivko</strong> always pleases the listeners with his reports, they are always filled with valuable experience, besides, it‚Äôs just interesting to listen to Nicholas.  For example, we can recall his such reports: <a href="https://habr.com/company/oleg-bunin/blog/423085/">about load balancing</a> , about <a href="https://habr.com/company/oleg-bunin/blog/340114/">monitoring web projects</a> and about <a href="https://habr.com/company/oleg-bunin/blog/316898/">operation</a> .  At DevOpsConf Russia, Nikolay <a href="https://devopsconf.io/moscow/2018/abstracts/4005">will talk</a> about using Kubernetes in conditions of maximum resiliency and lack of human resources for this task. <br><br><h3>  Manage secrets with Hashicorp Vault </h3>  <font color="#808080">14:00, hall ‚ÄúThank you for the fish‚Äù</font> <br><br>  <a href="https://devopsconf.io/moscow/2018/abstracts/4101">The report of</a> <strong>Sergey Noskov is</strong> very vital and thorough.  It contains many important details about Avito's experience, the use of very different approaches and the living pain that was managed. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/sy/qo/jq/syqojqdaefadkagtpumzrbswfpo.jpeg"><br><br><h3>  Istio up and running </h3>  <font color="#808080">15:00, hall ‚ÄúThank you for the fish‚Äù</font> <br><br>  <strong>Alexander Lukyanchenko</strong> in Avito is creating and maintaining an internal cloud and platform.  At DevOpsConf Russia, Alexander will try to uncover an infrequently encountered topic and <a href="http://devopsconf.io/moscow/2018/abstracts/3994">tell you</a> about the architecture and how <strong>Istio</strong> works <strong>as a Service Mesh</strong> . <br><br><h3>  Making CI for mobile SDK from scratch </h3>  <font color="#808080">17:00, hall ‚ÄúThank you for the fish‚Äù</font> <br><br>  This report should interest not only experts in DevOps, but also developers <strong>from the world of mobile applications</strong> .  After all, <strong>Artem Nikitin</strong> (HERE Technologies) is going to <a href="https://devopsconf.io/moscow/2018/abstracts/3735">highlight a</a> lot of technologies at once, including open source, for continuous integration for the mobile SDK. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/co/ox/gd/cooxgde4lsvgqq8kaadgzccxhfm.jpeg"><br><br>  To reveal the topic of security in DevOps, we, of course, will not limit ourselves to one report.  These stories are based on concrete examples and live services that destroy the myth that security and DevOps are incompatible. <br><br><h3>  Fear and Loathing DevSecOps </h3>  <font color="#808080">13:00, hall "On the Edge of the Universe"</font> <br><br>  <strong>Yuri Shabalin</strong> (Swordfish Security) <a href="https://devopsconf.io/moscow/2018/abstracts/4125">will figure</a> out how to approach the <strong>embedding of the secure development</strong> process in the DevOps process and how <strong>not to break anything</strong> .  In the course of the report we will clarify the main stages of safety testing.  Let's see what tools you can use, how they differ from each other, and how to properly configure them in order to successfully implement DevSecOps.  Yuri has vast experience in the information security industry, he will use <strong>real examples to</strong> tell us about the pitfalls and unobvious tasks. <br><br><h3>  How we built Patch Management in Qiwi </h3>  <font color="#808080">16:00, hall "On the Edge of the Universe"</font> <br><br>  <a href="https://devopsconf.io/moscow/2018/abstracts/4062">Report</a> <br>  <strong>Nikolay Samuvat</strong> will be useful to you if you also do not want to see <strong>vulnerabilities in your infrastructure</strong> .  It will be about improving the efficiency of the Patch Management process using <strong>Zabbix Threat control</strong> and Patch scheduler. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/kx/se/3u/kxse3unq6lkline-mc81ci_q-qe.jpeg"><br><br><h3>  Patterns in architecture <br></h3><br>  The patient turned out to be the theme of the template architecture and microservice approaches.  In this direction we will have two reports. <br><br>  <strong>Maxim Vikharev</strong> promises to <a href="https://devopsconf.io/moscow/2018/abstracts/3842">tell the</a> whole <strong>DevOps-saga</strong> ‚Äúabout the template microservice‚Äù: how to give developers the opportunity to independently bring new services into one new service in one hour and not forget anything. <br><br>  <strong>Igor Dolzhikov</strong> <a href="http://devopsconf.io/moscow/2018/abstracts/3957">will reveal the secret of</a> how to <strong>satisfy an SRE</strong> or a service on Go in a container in 5 minutes.  You can evaluate the problem from different angles in the hall ‚ÄúOn the Edge of the Universe‚Äù, on October 1 at 11:00 and at 17:00. <br><br><h2>  October 2, Tuesday <br></h2><br>  The second day will also be very rich, but more <strong>practical and practical</strong> .  We study specific examples of large companies, let's talk about the technological tools that are used to build the process.  In theses of reports there are fewer product names, and more and more abbreviations: CI, CD, IaC. <br><br>  On the second day there will be reports about transformation, and in two completely different situations.  <strong>Anton Isanin</strong> <a href="https://devopsconf.io/moscow/2018/abstracts/3962">will tell</a> about this process in Alfa-Bank.  <strong>Ilya Stekolnikov</strong> CIO of Wheels of the company <a href="https://devopsconf.io/moscow/2018/abstracts/3991">will consider the</a> question of DevOps transformation in a technology company. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/js/ed/1e/jsed1e7i5rbo7mcqxdxuvfvqrms.jpeg"><br><br>  Let's start the program on October 2 with a report whose name directly contradicts the principle of building the program of our conference. <br><br><h3>  The main thing is not quality, but quantity! </h3>  <font color="#808080">10:00, hall ‚ÄúThank you for the fish‚Äù</font> <br><br>  So <a href="https://devopsconf.io/moscow/2018/abstracts/3723">says the</a> founder of the company Zerocracy <strong>Yegor Bugaenko</strong> .  Well, we will have the opportunity to argue, is it true, quality is not what programmers should first think about.  Given the great experience of Egor and his charisma, we can expect that in the end the industry will be a few more evangelicals of this approach. <br><br><h3>  We deliver to Kubernetes.  Continuously and in their own way </h3>  <font color="#808080">10:00, Hall "On the Edge of the Universe"</font> <br><br>  <strong>Yevgeny Dekhtyaryov</strong> came to 2GIS to clean up the infrastructure.  But the <a href="https://devopsconf.io/moscow/2018/abstracts/4023">report</a> will not be about the whole process, but only about the part that concerns the delivery of applications to Kubernetes.  It turned out that a ready-made solution is not enough, and the guys came up with their own.  We will learn about what prompted the development of our own tool, and, most importantly, <strong>we will get a link to the OpenSource version</strong> , which, as promised, will make the world a better place. <br><br><h3>  Automating Clouds </h3>  <font color="#808080">11:00, hall ‚ÄúThank you for the fish‚Äù</font> <br><br>  The feature of the company Uchi.ru is that all 300 applications contained in the current system are <strong>100% located in public clouds</strong> on dockers.  <strong>Alexey Vakhov</strong> will tell you what other tools have been tried in the company at different stages of its development, and in concrete terms will show when it is reasonable to start using clouds, containers, configuration and infrastructure management systems.  Alexey always uses a <strong>systematic scientific approach</strong> , therefore, if you need serious arguments and common sense, come to this <a href="https://devopsconf.io/moscow/2018/abstracts/4037">report</a> . <br><br><h3>  How we came to the Continuous Delivery.  Cones, rakes, future plans </h3>  <font color="#808080">15:00, hall ‚ÄúThank you for the fish‚Äù</font> <br><br>  The company <strong>Tinkoff.ru</strong> , having experience in the implementation of unique technological solutions, for a long time was not particularly eager to share them, but now slowly comes out of the shadows.  Apparently, the number of stuffed cones overcame the threshold, and the results passed the test of time. <br><br>  <strong>Andrei Ermakov</strong> and <strong>Yuri Tregubov</strong> <a href="https://devopsconf.io/moscow/2018/abstracts/4013">will talk</a> about the transition to a continuous supply, of course, by overcoming the falling tests, the limitations of the tools, the production bugs. <br><br>  Andrey Ermakov will separately and in more detail <a href="https://devopsconf.io/moscow/2018/abstracts/3985">describe the</a> tool for developers for <strong>Continuous Delivery as Code</strong> . <br><br><h3>  Stream Processing Platforms </h3>  <font color="#808080">16:00, hall ‚ÄúThank you for the fish‚Äù</font> <br><br>  <strong>Evgeny Potapov,</strong> one of our regular speakers, pleased us with reports on the <a href="https://habr.com/company/oleg-bunin/blog/321382/">support of high-load projects</a> and, for example, the <a href="https://habr.com/post/322242/">optimization of architecture</a> .  Recently, ITSumma took on new infrastructure tasks, and this time, Eugene <a href="https://devopsconf.io/moscow/2018/abstracts/4195">will share his experience in</a> building fault-tolerant platforms for stream processing and analysis of data on the <strong>Apache Stack,</strong> and most importantly - experience in their operation.  This performance is worth listening to, at least in order to <strong>recharge your energy and enthusiasm</strong> to solve new challenges. <br><br><h2>  Master Classes  Hall "Marvin" <br></h2><br>  In addition to the main program of the reports, our speakers prepared several practical two-hour sessions on specific important tasks.  Taking part in them will be useful if you have already encountered a similar problem, but have not yet fully understood it, or even if you have never dealt with it in your own practice.  Then this is a great opportunity to <strong>touch the technology with your hands</strong> , but at the same time accompanied by an instructor, that is, with greater efficiency and the ability to immediately receive a qualified recommendation.  The downside, of course, is that you have to skip as many as two reports, but the reports will definitely be recorded, but the master classes will not. <br><br><h3>  Monitoring using Prometheus using Atlassian applications as an example </h3>  <font color="#808080">October 1 at 11:00</font> <br><br>  During this master class we will try on real-life examples of Prometheus and Grafana to monitor third-party applications.  <strong>Andrey Markelov</strong> and <strong>Alexey Matveyev</strong> will demonstrate the capabilities of the tools on the example of exporters: Node exporter, Jira exporter and Bitbucket exporter.  We will deal with metrics, configure discovery services and configure alerts. <br><br><h3>  Modern approaches to the development of infrastructure code on Puppet </h3>  <font color="#808080">October 1 at 15:00</font> <br><br>  Under the guidance of <strong>Igor Kurochkin,</strong> we will create a repository using the latest from the <strong>Puppet 5 ecosystem</strong> .  We form the structure of the module from the template, run it through the pipeline, run the syntax, unit and integration tests, automatically create the documentation and load the resulting artifact into the Puppet Forge repository.  We will deal with <strong>the infrastructure repository device</strong> , understand how to manage external dependencies, how to test everything together and deliver the infrastructure code.  In addition to practice, Igor will devote attention and theory to a better understanding of the <strong>Infrastructure</strong> approach <strong>as a code</strong> . <br><br><h3>  Ansible idempotent.  Reliable and predictable scenarios from the first time </h3>  <font color="#808080">October 2 at 11:00</font> <br><br>  This event should be visited at least in order to learn a new complex word :) But seriously, <strong>Alexey Sokolov will</strong> introduce us to the advanced scripting techniques Ansible.  Let's practice working with <strong>debugging output</strong> , developing conditional logic, and <strong>creating scripts</strong> that are resistant to external factors. <br><br>  <em>Please note</em> : you must perform training on <a href="https://github.com/zloyplohoy/ansible_the_idempotent">this</a> instruction. <br><br><h3>  Setting up the docker cluster using HashiCorp tools </h3> <font color="#808080">October 2 at 15:00</font> <br><br>  Everyone says Kubernetes, and <strong>Alexey Vakhov is</strong> building clusters <strong>on the HashiCorp stack</strong> , he is quite satisfied and is ready to teach everyone.  And, as already noted, Alexey approaches all questions from a position of common sense, therefore, it will be extremely useful to learn his motivation.  In addition to the master class <strong>does not need any preparation</strong> and installation of some special software, we will do everything in the browser.  As a result, from nothing, everyone can get a <strong>working version of the cluster</strong> , with monitoring, logging, and a sense of complete satisfaction. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/gw/dj/m7/gwdjm7jg4ohhoy_yg5n61j2wc9g.png"><br><br><h3>  DevOps Deflope BoF <br></h3><br>  The conference will be closed by a large informal meeting with DevOps Deflope, which I have already mentioned <a href="https://habr.com/company/oleg-bunin/blog/423977/">separately</a> .  Anyone who is even slightly interested in DevOps practitioners, knows this channel as a very convenient means to learn about news in the world and in Russia.  That is, all our participants will be interested in <strong>listening to their opinions on the latest trends and ask their questions</strong> . <br><br>  In this review, we were able to highlight the most discussed reports, the full <a href="https://devopsconf.io/moscow/2018/abstracts">program</a> and <a href="https://devopsconf.io/moscow/2018/schedule">schedule</a> on the conference website.  The conference will be held on October 1 and 2 in Infospace in Moscow, you can register by <a href="https://conf.ontico.ru/conference/join/RC2018-moscow.html">clicking</a> on the <a href="https://conf.ontico.ru/conference/join/RC2018-moscow.html">link</a> . <br><br>  I expect that the two working days of the conference will be so intense that they will come to an end as imperceptibly as their review.  But at the same time, they will allow for a long time to be charged with new ideas and far-reaching plans, the implementation of which can be told in a year. <br><br><blockquote>  The program is the result of the joint work of the Program Committee.  The participants were <a href="https://habr.com/users/cazorla19/">Mikhail Chinkov</a> , Vyacheslav Kuznetsov, <a href="https://habr.com/users/Ramm/">Danila Shtan</a> , <a href="https://habr.com/users/Frodox/">Vitaly Rybnikov</a> , <a href="https://habr.com/users/bhavenger/">Dmitry Zaitsev</a> , Valeria Pilia, <a href="https://habr.com/users/andshorin/">Andrei Shorin</a> , <a href="https://habr.com/users/minicon/">Nikita Borzykh</a> , Andrei Kononov, <a href="https://habr.com/users/p0b0rchy/">Roman Poborchy</a> . <br>  Say thanks to all of them! <br><br>  Join the movement to integrate development, testing and operation.  Participate in <a href="https://devopsconf.io/moscow/2018">DevOpsConf Russia</a> to understand, not only how to use any technology correctly, but, first of all, understand why it is needed. <br></blockquote></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/422835/">https://habr.com/ru/post/422835/</a></p>
