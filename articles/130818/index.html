Investors monitor its annual reports, relying on them in choosing a strategy.  Her first report in 1995 marked the beginning of the dot-com boom and radically changed investors' views on IT and web development.

      The list proposed by Mary Miker is as follows: <br><br><ol><li>  Globalization </li><li>  Mobile technology </li><li>  User interface </li><li>  Online shopping: fast, easy, interesting, cheap </li><li>  Online advertising </li><li>  Content creation has changed a lot </li><li>  Technology Lead - USA </li><li>  Mega-trend: empowering through mobile communications </li><li>  Economy: a lot of uncertainties </li></ol><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The report notes that in the 20th largest Internet companies in the world there are more and more companies from China, Japan and Russia, which over time will only come on the heels of the Americans. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/9c9c3fda/5e313e35/df0aeb28/b3cb8a55.jpg"><br><br>  Large Internet companies are now not only in the USA: the rest of the world is also gaining momentum. <br><br>  Despite the fact that the United States continues to lead in the number of Internet users in percentage terms, the growth rate of the Internet audience in China, India, Nigeria, Russia and Iran is much higher.  A few years ago, no one would have thought that these countries, according to the rate of growth of Internet users, would occupy leading positions in the same rating.  And these are new audiences, and, therefore, new markets, which have to be reckoned with. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/b24b7c76/9d2dacbe/7366db28/d8011948.jpg"><br><br>  According to the statistics given in the report, an average Russian user spends 9.7 hours per month on social networks.  This is about 30 minutes a day.  With this indicator, we occupy only 5th place, while the United States went to 12th position.  The top three are Israel, Argentina and Turkey. <br><br>  Such a gap can be explained by the presence of a huge amount of illegal content in the domestic social networks, the viewing of which takes the lion's share of the users' time.  While law-abiding Facebook users use social networks for their intended purpose. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/8c458151/6a522f94/bbd3ffec/588ea11b.jpg"><br><br>  As in last year‚Äôs report, Ms. Meeker pays great attention to strengthening the position of the mobile Internet.  To date, the percentage of mobile Internet users is a little less than 60% (according to Morgan Stanley Research).  Despite the fact that Russia is far from the leader in terms of non-voice mobile traffic (15th place in the ranking), the current growth trend is also for us: the growth of 3G users for the year was 59% (according to Imforma WCIS +). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/af128ecf/0aa9a54b/2f75b245/02d0d999.jpg"><br><br>  The main advantage of the entire telecommunications industry, and mobile Internet in particular, is unprecedented growth even in times of crisis.  According to Morgan Stanley Research analysts, the introduction and popularization of smartphones and tablets, GPS navigators leads to an exponential growth of mobile Internet technologies.  The peculiarity of the current period is that during one generation there were 2 major economic upheavals, and in each of them Internet technologies showed an ‚Äúvitality‚Äù unusual for new technologies. <br><br>  The logical continuation of the trend of growing popularity of the mobile Internet is an increase in the number of purchases through the mobile Internet.  Only eBay carried out operations for 4 billion.  Dollars per year with this type of communication! <br><br>  The increase in the number of purchases through the phone has forced many online stores to think about the convenience of the shopping process.  Buying in 3 clicks is not the limit of perfection.  The smaller the user has to take action, the higher the likelihood that the product will be purchased. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/dae59cb1/1d75b59e/6acdd121/bdb48559.jpg"><br><br>  <a href="http://www.scribd.com/doc/69309864/KPCB-Internet-Trends-2011">Based on the report by Mary Meeker (Mary Meeker)</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/130818/">https://habr.com/ru/post/130818/</a></p>
