The second direction is a new level of consumer control over content, which completely rebuilds the old marketing model of the "interrupt and annoy" type.  These two phenomena, combined with the need of brands in the shortened marketing cycle, push events to new metrics and practices in achieving the Holy Grail of marketing: the best involvement in the brand.

      <b>Required: new metrics</b> <br><br>  As the simple attraction of attention has ceased to be appreciated and brands began to demand the creation of a deeper involvement from consumers, the old metrics like price-per-click, are becoming less and less relevant.  Hestings described the new measurement standards, which he called ‚Äúcustomer engagement points‚Äù, which are similar to traditional media rating units.  He said that there are three reasons why only a system that uses units of engagement can be applied in the marketing of the future: it is comprehensive, it uses a single global currency that works for different media and different geographic areas and can adapt to non-permanent, rapidly changing market conditions. <br><br>  Within this system, each consumer contact is assigned a specific value based on consumer reports about which of the contacts were the most important for their purchase decision.  Units of engagement can be expressed in absolute numbers ‚Äî for example, the effectiveness of a given contact ‚Äî as well as in relative numbers, such as a share of brand involvement compared to competitors.  The value can vary in time, in space (geography) and depending on the target group - if we call only a few basic variables.  For example, if I‚Äôm involved in car marketing, Hesting notes that ‚Äúa lot of contacts can have a zero involvement value if the customer is not in the car buying cycle‚Äù, at the same time, the same contacts can have a huge cognitive, emotional or behavioral value for the same customer. <br><br>  So that the audience did not look at the principles of involvement as a pure theory, Hestings drew attention to the studies conducted by his company, which demonstrate a ‚Äúvery high correlation‚Äù - about 80 percent - between the brand‚Äôs share in client involvement and its market share, thereby proving That engagement actually translates into sales. <br><br>  <b>Keyword: process</b> <br><br>  So, since marketers know what successful engagement is, the main question becomes ‚ÄúHow do we change our approach to engagement?  We need what developers call a congruence model ‚Äù- something that is more in line with the new tasks of companies related to consumer engagement. <br><br>  The modern culture of ‚Äúhierarchical (siloed) marketing structures‚Äù and ‚Äúmanagerialism‚Äù prevent many companies from paying attention to these ideas, Hestings said.  He pointed to the need for a more horizontal organization, as opposed to the existing vertical command-and-control model.  In the context of the new marketing process, the incoming data - client details - will become the material that will be transformed into who, what, where, and how for the marketing campaign.  The return from such a system will be measurable client involvement. <br><br>  As the industry approaches this model, marketing organizations will need what Hestings called the ‚ÄúChampion of Involvement‚Äù, who would conduct research, as well as media and communication expertise to manage the process.  In addition, they will need new tools, including software, allowing them to create instant reports right on the desktop, which will reflect the effectiveness of engagement and effectiveness, as well as the ability to instantly simulate small changes in strategy (what-if scenarios) and their possible effect on involvement. <br><br>  <b>Winners and losers</b> <br><br>  Any changes always bring one player more benefits than others and marketing in its reincarnation from the unpredictable, immeasurable and long-cyclical today to the effective, in terms of the process, tomorrow is also not an exception.  Among those that will be left behind, according to Hestings, will be ‚Äúadvertising-centric or marketing-communication-centric‚Äù organizations, because they hold on to familiar tools too tightly and don‚Äôt pay enough attention to engagement.  But smaller marketers and nimble, customer-centric companies will thrive because they no longer need huge budgets and huge advertising agencies to compete. <br><br>  And, at the end, the entire industry will become less visible in itself.  As Hestings says: ‚ÄúWe will no longer be called marketers, but will become engagement workers‚Äù <br><br>  <b>Translation from English to:</b> <br>  <a href="http://blog.worldwebstudio.com/">blog.worldwebstudio.com</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/30889/">https://habr.com/ru/post/30889/</a></p>
