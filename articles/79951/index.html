  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How familiar are we with fiction? - survey results</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  A couple of weeks ago, a <a title="poll" href="http://falko.habrahabr.ru/blog/79240">survey</a> was published on Habr√© about acquaintance with a hundred of the most significant science fiction pieces according <a title="original list" href="http://www.mirf.ru/Articles/art2998.htm">to the</a> World of Science Fiction.  More than two and a half hundred people became interested in this question, noting the books read in the proposed questionnaire.  It's time to take some results. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <strong>266 answers</strong> are already the result, allowing something to be considered and to draw some conclusions.  The most interesting for everyone will probably be the <strong>top most read</strong> and least read science fiction works from among the hundreds of the most significant for world fiction according to the famous magazine.  But let's say right away - there is no such work that everyone would read.  I will say even more - even such a book is not even close. <br><br><ol><li>  The Master and Margarita - Mikhail Bulgakov - <strong>85%</strong> </li><li>  Gulliver's Travels - Jonathan Swift - <strong>78%</strong> </li><li>  cycle about the Emerald City - Alexander Volkov - <strong>77%</strong> </li><li>  Alice in Wonderland - Lewis Carroll - <strong>74%</strong> </li><li>  Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea - Jules Verne - <strong>74%</strong> </li><li>  Dozory - Sergey Lukyanenko, Vladimir Vasilyev - <strong>73%</strong> </li><li>  The Lord of the Rings - John R. R. Tolkien - <strong>72%</strong> </li><li>  Monday starts on Saturday, ‚ÄúTale of the Troika‚Äù - ABS - <strong>68%</strong> </li><li>  Cycle about Alice Selezneva - Kir Bulychev - <strong>65%</strong> </li><li>  War of the Worlds - HG Wells - <strong>63%</strong> </li></ol><br><br>  It is noteworthy that a dozen of the most widely read exactly half consists of <strong>Russian-speaking</strong> authors. <br>  And such works as Amphibian Man, I, the Robot, Time Machine and 451 Fahrenheit did not have enough a few percent to enter the top ten.  But these figures are indicative.  "The Master and Margarita" leads by a significant margin from its competitors - the work of Bulgakov 22 points ahead of the threshold of entry into the top famous fantasy works.  In other words, out of every 10 science fiction fans, almost 9 know who Woland is not according to the film, and only 6 know how dangerous the Martian combat tripods are.  And this is - a dozen of the most widely read works of a fantastic genre!  Well, yes, a few more figures about this later.

      The most <strong>obscure</strong> books from the above list were read by really few people. <br><ol><li>  Gods of Pegans - Lord Dunsany - <strong>1%</strong> </li><li>  Gormengast - Mervyn Peak - <strong>2%</strong> </li><li>  New Sun Cycle - Gene Wolfe - <strong>2%</strong> </li><li>  Illuminatus!  - Robert Shea, Robert A. Wilson - <strong>2%</strong> </li><li>  cycle "Legends of Newford" - Charles de Lint - <strong>2%</strong> </li><li>  Malville - Robert Merle - <strong>3%</strong> </li><li>  cycle of the Alliance and the Union - Carolyn J. Cherry - <strong>4%</strong> </li><li>  Lovers - Philip Jose Farmer - <strong>4%</strong> </li><li>  Space Lark - Evard Elmer "Doc" Smith - <strong>4%</strong> </li><li>  Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell - Suzanne Clark - <strong>4%</strong> </li></ol><br><br>  Now you know what books you need to read in order to be known as a real expert on science fiction (according to the version of the World of Science Fiction)?  It is their survey participants who know the least.  You can literally count such experts on your fingers, and if you want to be one of them, ask the <em>gods Pegana</em> or something. <br>  It does not make sense to list all the titles of books that less than one person out of every 10 science fiction fans would read.  Suffice it to say that neither Frankenstein nor Pullman with his religious fantasy steampunk managed to break the <strong>10% readability limit</strong> .  And really - if you can watch a movie, then why read a book?  On the other hand, there is not a single book that only one person would read, well, except perhaps Pegans are the same <em>gods</em> (who are they, actually?). <br><br>  If we talk about common figures, the picture is even more indicative.  Only <strong>18% of</strong> all books, namely 18 titles, are familiar not by hearsay to <strong>half of</strong> all fiction lovers who took part in the survey.  The rest of the books are most likely niche; they have their admirers who do not so often go beyond the genre of interest.  <strong>Every fourth book</strong> (27% of all) is known to only <strong>one out of 10</strong> fans of the genre. <br><br>  Let's look at it from the other side.  Only <strong>one person</strong> indicated in the questionnaire that he had read <em>all the books from the list</em> .  True, he did not leave any comment and return address, but we will believe and congratulate in absentia.  Another <em>familiar with 96% of the</em> fundamental science fiction.  It would be nice to know his comments on all these figures and the questionnaire as a whole.  He clearly has something to be proud of - only <strong>10.9% of</strong> all those who participated in the survey are <strong>familiar with every second book</strong> in the list.  Only <strong>4.5%</strong> (12 people for accuracy) can be considered genuine experts among themselves, as many people read <em>more than 60% of all books</em> from the list.  At the same time, there are relatively few random people in statistics - only <em>11% of</em> all respondents are familiar with <strong>less than 10 books</strong> out of 100. More than 10 books have already been read by significantly more people - more than 26%.  And in general, the <strong>average level of familiarity with the fantastic literature on Habr√©, as shown by this questionnaire - 29%</strong> . <br><br>  What conclusions can be made from all this?  Of course, a large number of comments on Habr√© and in the questionnaire itself cast doubt on one or another work in the list or on the list, mourn the absence of any books.  We can agree with this, I also have objections and additions, if you think about it, but they would hardly have influenced the total percentage.  Well, remove a couple of books, add a few more - this will improve your performance by 2-3 percent, respectively.  The fact remains that - even if you like fiction, do not rush to be called its connoisseur.  Very few can boast of it (by the way, I also cannot - only 48%).  It remains only to agree with the very first comment to the questionnaire and recognize that it takes time to read, and we can only envy those who have it, or those for whom reading is a job. <br><br>  There is still a lot of things, albeit not from this list, I want to read, and much more will be really read, despite the chronic lack of time.  And one more thought.  Maybe our country was the most reading in the world, because we were once children and we had time for this?  It is with us? <br><br>  UPD: Thanks for the thought of add.  Statistics on the popularity of genres, I will try to count tonight. <br><br>  PS Tell me please, who has something - what else can I get interesting analytical information from from those survey data that I received?  Thank. <br></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/79951/">https://habr.com/ru/post/79951/</a></p>
