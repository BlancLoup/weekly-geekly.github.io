The process of the appearance of plaques cannot be stopped, however modern methods of treatment allow taking the disease under control and reducing the risk of its further development.  The main task of doctors is the early diagnosis of ischemia - a critical narrowing of the vessel with an atherosclerotic plaque. <a name="habracut"></a>

      The obstruction of the blood flow leads to dangerous oxygen starvation of the heart.  Often, the first symptoms (pressing pain in the chest, burning sensation, shortness of breath on exertion, asthma attacks) appear only after a dangerous development of the disease.  Advanced medical technology can help the doctor detect ischemia in a patient in a timely manner. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/dc5/afb/ad3/dc5afbad3f3f41f8a2abf14987a70171.jpg" width="500"><br><br><h4>  Clinical forms of coronary heart disease and "risk factors" </h4><br>  In accordance with the adopted World Health Organization in 1957‚Äî1969.  By standards, IHD (ischemic or coronary heart disease) is <a href="http://lekmed.ru/info/arhivy/trudnosti-diagnostiki-zabolevaniy-serdechno-sosudistoy-sistemy-10.html">understood to mean</a> ‚Äúacute or chronic diseases resulting from a decrease or cessation of blood supply to the myocardium (cardiac muscle) with damage to the coronary arteries.‚Äù <br><br>  Such diseases <a href="http://help-help.ru/neotl/article/23/">include</a> angina, myocardial infarction, post-infarction cardiosclerosis.  Often, coronary artery disease causes sudden cardiac death - instantaneous or following cardiac arrest no more than 6 hours after the onset of a heart attack. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/963/da2/59f/963da259ffae46d5a6e27a8039ada4be.jpg" width="500"><br><br>  The ‚Äúrisk factors‚Äù of IHD (and its preceding atherosclerosis) include: <br><br><ul><li>  Age over 40-45 years old (men over 40 and menopausal women are most susceptible) </li><li>  Increased blood pressure (more than 140/90 mm Hg. Art.) </li><li>  Diabetes and other disorders of carbohydrate metabolism </li><li>  Heredity (the more direct relatives suffered from diseases of the cardiovascular system, the higher the risk) </li><li>  Bad habits: smoking, alcohol abuse, drug addiction </li><li>  Malnutrition: overeating, abuse of fast food, sweet, fatty and fried foods </li><li>  Overweight and obesity </li><li>  Low physical activity, "sedentary" lifestyle </li><li>  Excessive physical activity </li><li>  Increased psycho-emotional stress, constant stress </li></ul><br><br><h4>  Diagnosis of Ischemic Heart Disease </h4><br>  The main difficulty in the treatment of coronary artery disease is that not all patients with a similar diagnosis seek medical help in a timely manner.  The first symptoms (among which, depending on the clinical form of the disease, high blood pressure, chest pain, weakness and shortness of breath,) can <a href="http://medportal.ru/enc/cardiology/ibs/">appear</a> only when the ‚Äúcholesterol plaques‚Äù block 60% or more of the lumen of the vessel. <br><br>  Comprehensive diagnosis of coronary heart disease <a href="http://www.panangin.ru/cardio/bolezni_serdca/ishemicheskaja-bolezn-serdtsa/diagnostika/">includes</a> a consultation with a physician and cardiologist, an electrocardiogram (ECG), diagnosis of cardiac muscle through ultrasound (EchoCG), blood tests and analysis of changes in ECG and / or EchoCG as a result of physical activity of the patient (for example, after climbing stairs or jogging on a treadmill).  In the event of ischemia, the next stage directly examines the patency of the arteries. <br><br>  ECG is the most common method of primary assessment of the state of the heart muscle, in particular for ischemia. <br><br><h4>  How medical portable devices for smartphones help identify and control the development of coronary heart disease </h4><br>  Since ischemic heart disease is difficult to fully control, it is important to regularly monitor the patient's health and assess the state of the cardiovascular system - in particular, to take an ECG.  However, the <a href="http://www.dvnovosti.ru/khab/2015/05/21/34319/">shortage of</a> medical personnel and <a href="http://iskra-kungur.ru/all/2015/04/16/11430/">waiting lists</a> for research in many localities of Russia impede the regular monitoring of the course of CHD.  Portable cardiac monitors will help solve the problem - devices that allow you to take an ECG and analyze the activity of the patient's heart muscle 24 hours a day without having to visit clinics. <br><br>  Modern medical <a href="http://www.wired.com/2014/03/internet-things-health/">gadgets</a> for smartphones allow doctors to monitor the health of the ‚Äúcores‚Äù remotely - innovative technologies <a href="http://rusbase.com/opinion/professional-wearables/">are being</a> actively <a href="http://rusbase.com/opinion/professional-wearables/">introduced</a> into the medical process in the United States, Europe and China.  For example, the China Healthcare Association supports the state program Wireless Heart Health, which aims to reduce mortality from cardiovascular diseases (and in particular, coronary artery disease).  Monitoring the health of patients with coronary artery disease using gadgets for smartphones can become common practice in Russia after the legislative regulation of <a href="http://www.rbc.ru/newspaper/2016/04/27/571f81809a7947a69b378cd9">telemedicine</a> . <br><br>  Already, in the domestic market, you can find gadgets that allow you to monitor the health of the cardiovascular system with a smartphone.  For example, the Russian company <a href="http://cardioqvark.ru/">CardioQVARK</a> creates cardiac monitor covers for iPhone 5, 5S, 6, 6S and SE.  ‚ÄúSmart‚Äù covers from CardioQVARK allow the wearer to take an ECG in any place convenient for him: just put your fingers on the sensors and after a few seconds the results will be stored in the cloud.  With the help of a special application, you can send them to your doctor and get recommendations from him. <br><br>  Patients with cardiovascular diseases usually need lifelong treatment and follow-up.  Patients with coronary artery disease is not an exception.  They are assigned a multicomponent drug therapy aimed at combating cholesterol, high blood pressure, as well as drugs that directly affect the work of the heart.  Doses of these drugs are selected individually and must be monitored by a doctor in a hospital or clinic, with the help of ECG monitoring.  Within the framework of the health care system, these studies are provided with a certain periodicity, which does not always correspond to the individual characteristics of the patient. <br><br>  Portable devices for individual use allow you to obtain a volume of information comparable to standard methods.  You can evaluate the ECG fragments at rest, with exercise, before and after taking the medication.  Medical gadgets provide a unique opportunity to register ECG at the request of the patient.  In any place and at any time when the patient felt unwell or symptoms of a disruption of the heart - pain or discomfort in the chest, shortness of breath, palpitations.  All these states can be manifestations of both the norm and the pathological state.  Any disruption of the heart must be evaluated by a specialist to determine further tactics of observation or treatment. <br><br>  <a href="http://cardioqvark.ru/">CardioQVARK</a> Company actively interacts with leading medical institutions of the country - the Russian Scientific Center of Surgery of the Russian Academy of Medical Sciences named after  B.V.  Petrovsky, the First Moscow State Medical University named after IM Sechenov, the Moscow City Scientific and Practical Center for Tuberculosis Control.  Domestic cardiologists note the high effectiveness of CardioQVARK cardiomonitor cases in the prevention of a number of cardiovascular diseases, including coronary heart disease. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/395675/">https://habr.com/ru/post/395675/</a></p>
