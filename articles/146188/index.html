      A year ago, we published a <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/122242/">report</a> on our first serious achievements, today we are in a hurry to please you with new successful transactions, significant updates on the site and tell you a little about the development of already invested start-up projects. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  So let's go ... </h2><br><h5>  The project "Elegant-service.ru" has attracted $ 550,000 </h5><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/fb2/120/d9f/fb2120d9f0dea547077b34092b9afafe.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>Dmitry, why did you decide to start your own business?</b> <br><br>  <i>‚ÄúI spent all my childhood in the village, and since all the boys love different pieces of iron, I actively participated in the repair of the old penny.</i>  <i>Every evening we met with friends, opened up a battered instruction manual and made it.</i>  <i>Most likely, my desire for the automotive business originates from childhood.</i>  <i>Nowadays, everyone wants to control their own time, movement, and how many value freedom of decision making. ‚Äù</i> <br><br>  <b>Tell us about the project Elegant-service.ru, how do you plan to spend the attracted investments?</b> <br><br>  <i>‚ÄúWe work for people who value true comfort in all its manifestations.</i>  <i>For them, we offer not only a modern and reliable fleet of vehicles, but also the responsibility and experience of all our employees.</i>  <i>In our work, we strive for excellence, taking into account all the wishes of our customers, ensuring the highest quality of elite taxi services, which fully complies with the requirements of our most demanding passengers.</i>  <i>The company has quite ambitious plans to establish a long-term VIP taxi service market, and business reputation is very important to us, based on positive feedback from each client.</i>  <i>In addition to guaranteed comfort, our company's cars are also an element of prestige, which has an important influence on business partners.</i>  <i>The attracted investments are mainly spent on the purchase of cars for our fleet and of course we are already compiling a media plan.</i>  <i><a href="http://www.napartner.ru/deals/16">I want to know more ...</a> "</i> <br><br><h5>  The project ‚ÄúAvtoDelka.ru‚Äù has raised $ 50,000 </h5><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/6ea/575/d47/6ea575d479ba1e909acc7d424c4e0b65.jpg"><br><br>  <b>Tell us about the AvtoDelka.ru project, how did you get the idea to create a similar product, what were your first difficulties?</b> <br><br>  <i>‚ÄúFor the Internet business is the future.</i>  <i>In addition, the Internet business can be well deployed throughout the country, working in his hometown, in the province.</i>  <i>There were some good ideas and ideas, but the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãcreating the site <a href="http://avtodelka.ru/">AvtoDelka.ru</a> - a set of useful services for a motorist, the main of which - a closed auction for car-care centers and car dealers - turned out to be leading in my head.</i>  <i>With this idea, I got to Seliger, where I was trained, I found a team that took on the technical side of the project.</i>  <i>At first, everything was done on their own money, of course.</i>  <i>Then you had to look for an investor.</i>  <i>I posted information about the project on napartner.ru, followed by feedback from potential investors.</i>  <i>Well, there already went-gone.</i>  <i>The only thing that grieved - everything went somehow not quite "according to plan."</i>  <i>Programmers were from another city, their organization grew in popularity, therefore, the number of their clients grew.</i>  <i>My project began to devote less time.</i>  <i>In my own city there are practically no free good specialists.</i>  <i>And his search took a lot of time.</i>  <i><a href="http://www.napartner.ru/deals/14">I want to know more ...</a> "</i> <br><br><h5>  The project "Personnel" has raised $ 15,000 </h5><br>  <b>Tell us about your HR program.</b> <br><br>  <i>‚ÄúThe working title of the project is‚Äú Personnel ‚Äù.</i>  <i>Mainly, the program should be extremely simple, at the same time maintain good functionality.</i>  <i>The program interface will be as intuitive as possible.</i>  <i>The principles of design are such that each object will be executed quite large, and as short as possible, but clearly display information about the employee.</i>  <i>Even the color of the object itself will carry information, such as the employee's rating or the quality of the work of the whole department.</i>  <i>The operator will need to enter the necessary information about employees and the quality of work, the number of errors, etc.</i>  <i>In general, the idea is to create a simple and intuitive product with a powerful analytical tool. ‚Äù</i> <br><br>  <b>What should a startup start do in order for a project to attract an investor?</b> <br><br>  <i>‚ÄúFirst of all, a start-up should write briefly and in essence, no need to go into some details, as long as the investor does not need it.</i>  <i>It is desirable to give specific figures of profitability, all the same, the investor invests in potential profit.</i>  <i>Project indicators can be calculated by statistical or comparison methods, the main thing is that they are justified.</i>  <i>And be sure to follow the rating, because even if no one sees the most golden idea, there will be no investor.</i>  <i><a href="http://www.napartner.ru/deals/15">I want to know more ...</a> "</i> <br><br><h5>  Interview with the founder of the project LinguaLeo </h5><br>  A few days ago, we received important comments on a $ 3,000,000 deal from our user <a href="http://www.napartner.ru/profile/1801/1">Abdulnasyrov Ainur</a> , the founder of the <a href="http://www.napartner.ru/startup/1093">LinguaLeo</a> project.  And although the project was not found by investors, on our site, we congratulate Ainur on one of the main stages in his life and give <img src="http://www.napartner.ru/images/dop/dop_small.png" alt="image">  account for 1 year. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/66c/b52/e7c/66cb52e7c8b71a00b9b7cacd30e2fe31.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <b>Ainur, tell us your story of the first business steps.</b>  <b>How it all began?</b>  <b>Why did you decide to create your own business?</b> <br><br>  <i>‚ÄúWhen I entered the State University Higher School of Economics I thought that I would become a good specialist with knowledge of English, and then, when I became experienced, I would start to do my business.</i>  <i>Because</i>  <i>it develops.</i>  <i>But in reality, at the 3rd course, my first project, ‚ÄúThe Club of Native Speakers‚Äù appeared, a language center for studying with foreigners, it quickly grew in 2-3 years, and by the time I graduated from the university, I sold it and started doing LinguaLeo, because it is very necessary for people and the market. "</i> <br><br>  <b>Your advice and recommendations for beginner Internet entrepreneurs</b> <br><br>  <i>‚ÄúDo not be afraid to start early and quickly lay out a prototype for testing on users.</i>  <i>There are even special concepts, such as MVP (minimal viable product), preaching rapid prototyping and product launch! ‚Äù</i> <br><br>  <b>What do you miss on Napartner.ru, what do you like?</b> <br><br>  <i>‚ÄúI have noticed a lot of progress over the past six months or a year.</i>  <i>The service has become a real social network for entrepreneurs, business angels and venture investors.</i>  <i>I would like the service to be able to collectively search for answers to many questions (business model / technology / people and team). ‚Äù</i> <br><br><h2>  New clothes ordered? </h2><br>  After the launch of our project in 2009, we began to probe our audience and did not even understand in which direction the wind would blow harder.  We changed the concept several times, analyzed the dynamics of the influx of Central Asia, and finally, by 2010, a clear understanding was formed of where to go further. <br><br>  To date, we have swum so far that it is simply not possible to stay! <br><br>  <b>Major updates that occurred this year:</b> <br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/a68/3f8/abf/a683f8abf9ff57d0dc9acb2e40e12494.jpg"></div><br><ul><li>  full-scale redesign; </li><li>  Service " <a href="http://www.napartner.ru/shop">Shop</a> " (now you can sell your start-up projects and ready business); </li><li>  Service " <a href="http://www.napartner.ru/packing">Packing startups</a> " (you have an idea and money? Our team is ready to implement this product, if necessary, we can allocate a team exclusively for the needs of your startup project); </li><li> the introduction of a new algorithm for forming opinions about the user's activity on the site (we wrote a relatively small formula by which users whose topics are really interesting receive more points in karma than those who have not distinguished with such a topic).  I would like a similar approach to be used here in Habr√©, the main weight in the user rating should be passed not by + and -, but the commenting topic itself.  Discussion of the topic is the indicator of its quality, it remains only to build the correct algorithm for forming the rating and karma; </li><li>  <a href="http://www.napartner.ru/rassilka">Automated mailing to investors</a> (now there is no need to send each investor, manually, information about your project); </li><li>  Convenient search on the site (to find an investor or a startup project has become easier and faster); </li><li>  <a href="http://www.napartner.ru/identifyinfo">Paid identification of investors</a> (as expected, investors are willing to pay for access to hidden start-up projects, moreover, the value of the identified investor itself is now expressed in material terms and doubles its credibility. Recall, investors could have gone through this procedure free of charge); </li></ul><br><br><iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/to3njPzaigU%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700002,15700021,15700186,15700191,15700253,15700255,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhgnTkGZOlMiqIL0QdhKh-RmvwH-AQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><h2>  About oldies </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/f65/192/3b4/f651923b471d50c4261f70c257e8ae0b.jpg"><br>  In 2011, the Vukraine.com project attracted $ 500,000 on our site, in order to assess global changes, we suggest <a href="http://vukraine.com/">visiting them</a> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/5eb/082/2ae/5eb0822ae9d654c061074052c784f93b.jpg" alt="image"><br>  The Flashells project attracted $ 60,000 from the seed stage.
