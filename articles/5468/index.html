  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The sale of UMI.CMS will change the site management systems market.</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  UMI Studio (www.umistudio.com), one of the leaders in the St. Petersburg web development market, announced the sale of rights to its own site management system UMI.CMS.  The deal resulted in the creation of a new independent company, Umisoft (www.umisoft.ru), which will develop new and sell already existing versions of the aforementioned CMS system.  UMI name for the company and the product, it was decided to keep as a tribute to the developer and the popularity of the product on the market. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Director of umistudio Sergey Kotyrev received a share in the authorized capital of the new company and took the post of general director of Umisoft LLC.  Sergey Zhuravlev, co-owner of the largest ad network of Runet AdMedia and its director, took the position of the executive director of umisoft.  The names of the remaining co-founders of the company have not been disclosed yet.  Who will take the vacant place of the head of UMI Studio, is also still unknown. <br><br>  ‚ÄúThe conclusion of this transaction is quite natural.  The market for "boxed" CMS (site management systems) is almost empty at the moment, but is quickly filling up.  We have funds for strategic investments, a promising product and the intention to be the first.  UMI.CMS was created by developers for developers, taking into account the interests of end users.  For those who understand the issue, its merits will be immediately clear.  Before making a decision to invest in this business, we analyzed the product in detail and, based on this analysis, formulated our own ambitions.  Our goal is for every website developer to build them on our product or on our platform.  I am confident in the leadership level of our product, as well as in the support and pricing policies that we offer to our partners, ‚Äùsaid Sergey Zhuravlev, executive director of umisoft.

      ‚ÄúWork on the creation of a cms-system was started 4 years ago, initially the product was created for umistudio‚Äôs own needs.  We have invested our love, precious time, experience and more than 200,000 dollars into the project.  As a result, we have created a really fast, convenient and inexpensive system, which will now be available to all site developers and their clients.  And I am glad that our project has attracted partners of this level.  UMI.CMS is an ideologically and technologically advanced site management system that allows you to easily create websites of any level, manage them without special training and save hardware, time and money both to developers and site owners.  The results of comparative usability testing and benchmark testify to this. <br>  In addition, the system will be offered to developers on the terms of Private Label, that is, as a platform for their CMS products under their own brand, ‚Äùsaid Sergey Kotyrev. <br><br>  At the first stage, professional developers of sites (studios, advertising agencies, freelancers) of Russia and the CIS countries will become the target market of the new company.  Many developers are not satisfied with the capabilities of the now-known cms-systems and are in search of a ‚Äúbox‚Äù that will work quickly, be easily customized, cheap, and satisfy their real needs.  While this demand is not satisfied, many still write cms for a specific site, spending money, time and becoming dependent on a specific developer.  For those and for others in the near future a package version of the Pro (Professional) product line will be released, designed for professional developers. <br>  For small projects and single developers, the SOHO (Small &amp; Home Office) product line has been updated, which has been successfully sold for almost a year. <br><br>  At the heart of umisoft‚Äôs policy is concern for partners.  Now the cost of the Lite version is $ 99, and the cost of the most expensive powerful version of Pro Commerce will not exceed $ 1000.  ‚ÄúWe believe that the cost of CMS in the overall budget for creating a website should not exceed 10%, so our prices will be available to developers of all regions and sizes.  We want to give our partners and customers the opportunity to earn money, while introducing a high-quality CMS.  We, as developers, have always felt the need for such a system from the very beginning of our work, and now it is our social responsibility to give a convenient and accessible tool to everyone who makes websites and to take on the solution of many of their problems.  We will support partners in every possible way and guarantee the maximum level of service in working with the UMI.CMS product and with umisoft, ‚Äùsaid Sergey Kotyrev. <br><br>  For customers of sites, too, good news - working with the site on UMI.CMS is intuitive, and its development takes no more than half an hour.  This removes the problem with the search and training of staff, because no special qualifications are required, and the care of a specially trained person who can update the site will no longer affect the work of the company.  No more multivolume instructions for adding news to the site are needed any more, as well as searching for site management consultants.  UMI.CMS is as simple as a complex product can be.  In this regard, developers are guided by the example of MS Word - a complex product, which nevertheless can be used 5 minutes after the first acquaintance.  Among other things, it is also worth noting that UMI.CMS was very beautiful from a visual point of view. <br><br>  ‚ÄúWe focus on thinking professionals who understand the essence of the quality of software products.  Our words are confirmed by facts, we do not give empty promises.  Until the release of the Pro version there are quite a bit.  Those who can not wait, we now advise and engage as testers and partners.  Now we have more than 4,000 registered users of the UMI.CMS Lite and Free licenses, for the next year we plan to sell the same number of Pro licenses, ‚Äùsaid Sergey Zhuravlev and Sergey Kotyrev. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/5468/">https://habr.com/ru/post/5468/</a></p>
