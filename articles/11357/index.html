  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Fully automatic manual system</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  This system was supposed to be truly perfect.  Ordered by an internal client that is not foreign to information technology, managed by a competent project manager, described by astute business analysts, designed by an experienced architect, created by talented programmers and polished to the light by vigilant testers.  It was entrusted with difficult but noble tasks, replacing the existing manual billing system with a fully automated system that will keep records of the services rendered, hours of work, bookkeeping and accounts.  She was called to save the organization‚Äôs staff a lot of time, and break the money to the company itself, transferring the processing of invoices to its halls.  But, alas, she stumbled upon an insurmountable obstacle - the Chief Technical Director. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  In the organization of D. Travis North, the technical director is proud to consider himself a man open to developers with all his heart.  He even manages to comply with all the certificates hung on his wall.  In any case, he thinks so.  If you look into his office, you can see that the latest subject of his pride is the certificate of an Expert in Visual Basic 4.0, the resulting more than ten are not back. <br><br>  No one knows exactly how the technical details of the new (for the most part already implemented) invoice management system got to him, but for an expert like him all this was totally unacceptable.  Therefore, the project was immediately frozen due to serious security problems. <br><br>  Most of all, the technical director was worried about the fact that programmers would gain access to the electronic payment system in order to realize electronic transfers.  He was told that technically programmers would not get access to the working system, only to their test system.  He was also told that the connection is made via a secure VPN channel to which programmers do not have direct access.  They also explained to him that the interface of electronic payments could work only with predefined bank accounts.  But in vain, still the risk was too great.  Fortunately, the technical director was already on the lookout for a better and safer solution.

      He demanded that such changes be made to the system, that each department and the head of the department had to print a report on electronic transfers.  Then the boss had to fax this report (because it‚Äôs safer than email) to the head office.  After that, these reports were to be entered line by line into the web application of the electronic payment system by one of six employees specially hired for this purpose. <br><br>  To this day, the system is still functioning.  Of course, it also happens that the employee makes a typo, and then someone notices her, but in his receipt.  However, D. perceives this as confirmation that the fully automatic manual system is still alive and well. <br><br>  <a href="http://ru.worsethanfailure.com/Articles/Polnostbyu-avtomaticheskaya-ruchnaya-sistema.aspx">ru.worsethanfailure.com/Articles/Polnostbyu-avtomaticheskaya-ruchnaya-sistema.aspx</a> <br>  Translation: <a href="http://ru.worsethanfailure.com/Authors/Evgeniy_Vigovskiy.aspx">Evgeny Vigovsky</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/11357/">https://habr.com/ru/post/11357/</a></p>
