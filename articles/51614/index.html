This storm turned into a hurricane after comments to the habratopics I wrote, that would not be bad for programmers to enter into their CMS products, or rather, to <a href="http://lawbreak.habrahabr.ru/blog/">create a CMS suitable for search engine optimization.</a>  In fact, as well as in this message, I don‚Äôt want to touch upon the aspects of SEO, various filters and other prishendaly that affect SERP, but I want to write in opposition to almost 100% of habracheloveks that seo, if not evil, then exactly the wrong thing.  So‚Ä¶ <br><br>  <strong>UPD:</strong> <br><br>  I am afraid that the community does not understand what is SEO, MFA, IFS, sattelity, partner sites.  What goals does each of them have?  Why optimization is needed and how to deal with HS.  As soon as the time appears, I will write a small review in the style: "How, what and why."

    <a name="habracut"></a><br>  The topic itself <hh user="ZakharS ZakharS">  and comments to it basically boil down to the fact that (there will be the main quotations and statements to them of my own IMHO): <br>  <strong>topic:</strong> <br><blockquote>  But gradually I come to the conclusion that search engine optimization as an end in itself is not needed.  It is much more important to pay attention to the content and usability of the site, as well as regularly add new publications. </blockquote><br><br>  The first and key error.  SEO is not <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25AE%25D0%25B7%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B1%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B8%25D1%2582%25D0%25B8">usability</a> and not, for the most part, copywriting.  I will give the most understandable example of the division of labor for habrasoobschestva, <a href="http://thematicmedia.ru/">"Thematic Media</a> . <a href="http://thematicmedia.ru/">"</a>  This greatest;) company is developing interfaces that will be convenient for users, but please note that on the pages (e) of the site there is no mention of search engine optimization as such, and besides, the site structure itself and all documents as such are not optimized. under search engines.  On the other hand, there is no reason to optimize, for requests like ‚Äúcreating interfaces‚Äù are many times cheaper to buy in directives, edvords, runners. <br><blockquote>  The bustle around keywords, meta tags, link exchange began to cause me aversion and healthy laziness in terms of applying all of this. </blockquote><br><br>  Another serious mistake, in fact, is the author's painting in non-professionalism.  All of the above is the last century.  Of course, some things are worth paying attention to, but it takes a minimum of time. <br><br><blockquote>  Let's move on to the examples.  Here is a short SEO tutorial, just one page.  But it is precisely his brevity, and he is valuable.  It shows the main things to pay attention to if you want to be higher in the search.  I think that the authors wrote it for themselves, based on personal experience.  Consider the most important of them. </blockquote><br><br>  Another author's mistake.  Promotion is an interesting job.  It is interesting in many things.  First - the competition.  It helps to develop, and if you stand still, sooner or later you will fail.  The universal textbook simply does not exist.  This, as a minimum, is proved by hundreds of different filters that are applied to the pages and practically every an up (with Yandex, of course) are twisted in a different direction.  SEO is, first of all, analytics, and only then the application of the received information to the promoted resource.  SEO is often a mind game, not a budget. <br><br><blockquote>  As you can see, almost all the things described above fall under the concept of simple common sense.  I do not see the need to spend a lot of time on optimization beyond what has been considered here. </blockquote><br><br>  In this and all the salt, there is no such thing as maximum optimization, very often a filter of the type ‚Äúyou are the last‚Äù is superimposed on the sites, due to the fact that the afro-optimizer has re-optimized the site.  And any search engine, accordingly, is counting on issuing not doorways, but sites for people.  All filters are aimed at what would show users only really valuable sites for them.  But you, dear webmasters, know about what the site should be at the moment, so that it could get into the top 10,5,1?  I think it is unlikely.  But you want visitors to be on your site?  I think yes.  So you have a choice: seo, smo, advertising purchase.  Really useful resource in NK niche will come out at the slightest SMO, and if the niche is competitive, and besides the site should generate revenue?  I will continue at the very end. <br>  <strong>According to the commentary, there were a lot of them (we will take the main branch, without going into the discussion):</strong> <br><br><blockquote>  I do not deny its necessity, but only say that SEO is secondary, and content and convenience are primary for success.  Having advertised the site, you should know what to do next :) </blockquote><br><br>  This is described in the first message.  You can also say that usability is not important, because the main thing is to create a good CMS, and CMS is not important without a good layout, and layout is not important with a quality design, and design is not important without a business plan, and a business plan without a customer.  Sorry, suffered) In general, make the separation between the professions.  Even a copywriter, a link manager is not an optimizer, this is one of the components of the mechanism called a quality web site. <br><blockquote>  &gt; You just need to write an article, and the key already from it to choose and insert into tags. <br><br>  Unfortunately, the majority of SEOs do the opposite, first they choose key phrases, and only then write an article on them ... </blockquote><br><br>  Articles - copywriters / rewriters.  Any text must meet the requirements that are set before the promotion.  This requirement is a semantic core.  Its competent preparation helps to get rid of unnecessary words and to maximize target traffic.  Not one self-respecting copywriter will not shove keywords through a word, but, nevertheless, using simple synonyms the user will not notice the text optimization seo.  There are several technologies for this that are completely white;) <br><br>  * Thinking whether to give a link to an example or a site on Drupal simply will not sustain the habraeffect ... * <br><blockquote>  Of course, please forgive me, but if there were no CEO - it would be much more pleasant to use the Internet.  Well, if I have a more or less specific request (product model, for example) ... Otherwise, you have to look at the mountains of husk (I wanted another word here).  The same applies to those clever who register domains with typos </blockquote><br><br>  Another popular opinion, but ... White optimization is mainly needed for direct sales or any other permanent profit.  We do not consider MFA sites that also require high attendance, but their need for the Internet is zero.  We say that the CEO helps to bring important information to the target client.  Ie, roughly speaking, when asked to buy a fur coat in Moscow, you should see only relevant requests, the rest for you - garbage.  And when competing in 10 companies, they should all be there, because the area, prices, models, and firms are important to you.  You have to choose what suits you best from all the stores, and not just from those who have read and correctly understood the textbook on promotion. <br><br><blockquote> I tell you, as an SEO specialist, search engine promotion is a primary goal for many.  But this is not always enough. <br><br>  Imagine a young company that is just starting its activities.  To pave the way from a startup to a stable organization, you need to make a lot of effort ooooooooochen.  It would be logical to develop your website and invest the budget in its promotion, thereby increasing its popularity and income due to the conversion of visitors into buyers.  Thus, it will occupy its niche in the search engine space for the desired keywords and perhaps this will become the main source of income. <br><br>  During my practice, I was convinced that ONLY through search engine optimization, you can achieve a lot in a more or less short period of time. <br><br>  But all the same, in our time, more and more are looking for information on the Internet, not everyone has the skills to use online stores, etc., so I think the usability of the site should be given a lot of attention! <br><br>  In general, what is search engine optimization?  I consider SEO solely as an integral part of an internet marketing campaign, which, in addition to SEO, contains usability, SMO, contextual advertising, etc. <br>  Only when this whole complex works at the same time will there be a maximum return on the money spent on promotion. <br><br>  &gt; Well, it is quite natural that the use of dirty optimization methods, such as keywords with a typo <br><br>  Why do you rank it as black methods?  You can get good traffic by optimizing for keys with spelling errors. </blockquote><br><br>  Good, clearly expressed position. <br><br><blockquote>  It will kill me most of all when, when choosing technologies to create a website, first of all they think how it will be indexed by a search engine ... </blockquote><br><br>  Again, an opinion based on the ‚Äúunderstanding‚Äù of the fact that for a clear structure of a site that a search engine will perceive well, something unimaginable is required.  This is not true.  Do you think Habr is a good project in terms of architecture?  Yes, he has obvious shortcomings that can be fixed, but they are not critical.  Habr is made logically correct, and this gives a combination of both usability and search engine optimization.  What is good for a person is even better for a bot.  And as a result, Habr soars up in many requests. <br><br>  In general, everything.  I would also like to say that SEO is an alternative to attracting customers and the price for it comes from many factors.  To make it clearer I will write all possible options for website / portal / product promotion: <br><br><ul><li>  Search engine optimization </li><li>  Social optimization </li><li>  Contextual advertising </li><li>  Natural advancement </li><li>  Viral marketing </li></ul><br><br>  And the choice is made easy.  The head of everything is money, or rather, costs / revenues. <br>  The price of SEO should be lower than the purchase of links in Yandex by 20-30%, otherwise optimization is not profitable.  And this means that popular business niches, such as car rentals, are suitable for promotion, but not in any way buy maclaren.  Just because there is a certain minimum.  Promotion of such a site may not even require money, but who will work with the site for 1t.r./month, for example?  Thousand, it is certainly not bad, but buying advertising on demand is even cheaper. <br><br>  If you are developing a portal, then without SMO (companies in blogs, targeted resources) you need.  Partially, and SEO, of course, but the main goal - to block traffic from competitors. <br><br>  Contextual advertising, as written above, is important with a small number of potential customers. <br><br>  Natural promotion, natural promotion ... Name at least one successful project that didn‚Äôt move? <br><br>  Viral marketing - the lot of big budget and large coverage.  Optimization is not suitable here, because for frequent this new name, which will not be searched for, the purchase of links will not work either.  Natural promotion is certainly not a solution, because where there is a big budget, there are big demands for profit.  There remains an option in order to interest almost everyone who might be interested.  In this case, not to a large extent using SMO, but as a result of word of mouth.  But, it is clear that viral marketing is not a solution with a budget of 20-30 tr.  (average cost of optimization). <br><br>  So, gentlemen IT specialists, treat those who spend many hours on various tests that last for several months, on thinking over the information received, on comprehending new ideas and, there is no place to hide, search for bugs, for competing with those with you are on an equal footing, actually leading them to wrestling with understanding.  After all, each new +1 is nothing more than overtaking a competitor on a long track, which has no end.  Thanks to those who read to the end;) <br><br>  * I ask you to forgive for possible blots and stylistic mistakes, unfortunately there is no time to read the above, but I promise I will correct it as soon as possible. <br><br>  _________ <br><br></hh></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/51614/">https://habr.com/ru/post/51614/</a></p>
