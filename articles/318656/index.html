I want to share an unusual story, how from an ordinary gamer I became a game developer. <br><br>  At the moment, created a simple level and introduced the basic elements of the mechanics of the game.  I offer an introductory 20-second video. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GPNehq-qwrw" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  <i>‚ÄúYes, my hero looks like Ragnar, there will be a different appearance in the full version.‚Äù</i> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Yes, now there is a ready-made prototype of the game ‚ÄúForging Destiny: HROFT‚Äù with the simplest graphics, which includes:

      ‚Ä¢ 4 types of enemies, each of which has its own style of combat; <br>  ‚Ä¢ a hero with a normal attack and super attack, block, rebounds and somersaults; <br>  ‚Ä¢ voice of all characters, environments and effects; <br>  ‚Ä¢ combat system. <br><br>  The fact is that I created this prototype, not being either a programmer, or an animator, or an artist.  I am not from a rich family, my work is not related to games and the salary is 18 thousand rubles. <br>  In my example, everyone can do this, but not everyone will do that.  We all have our own way, the main thing is to strive for a goal, and not to engage in an eternal thought process. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/6b1/8b1/6b7/6b18b16b73774a15b97002614703dd5a.jpg"><br>  <i>"This art, the artist painted 70 hours, for free, especially for the project"</i> <br><br><h3>  At the beginning of the journey </h3><br>  3 years ago I had a burning desire to create a game.  I was looking for enthusiasts to develop this project.  But, as it turned out, it is easier to find a needle in a haystack than such people. <br><br>  He himself learned to program, draw and animate.  It was especially difficult for me, since all these programs were absolutely unknown to me. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/43c/a12/555/43ca12555f374cc394bfc1a42f68eeee.jpg"></div><br>  <i>"Learned to program on GM"</i> <br><br>  After six months of daily labor I burned out, because I did everything alone (I understand those people who create their projects alone, these are really iron people). <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/7fb/eca/fd6/7fbecafd6c10415daca80aee3821c8c1.jpg"></div><br>  <i>‚ÄúI drew in Photoshop, animated in Anime Studio‚Äû</i> <br><br>  After some time, the desire to create a game again took over.  But I decided to go another way - to hire freelancers.  Since there was no money, I began searching for investors. <br><br>  He wrote to successful entrepreneurs who have their own groups in VC and channels on YouTube.  I wrote to more than 60 investors and on the 12th day of searching I found interested people.  We discussed the project with them for about a month, and they estimated only marketing at 5,000,000 rubles.  They were not ready for such a sum, so they postponed the project "until better times." <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/bf4/0e2/230/bf40e223002248e6bb4a9f9182503cb7.jpg"><br>  <i>‚ÄúThis is a small part of the level plan.‚Äù</i> <br><br>  I was saddened by their refusal, but I was not going to surrender, because in 3 years more than 100 pages of documentation were written around the game: all enemies, their behavior, all levels are lined up, a very powerful plot is written.  I want to give the players a real drive from the battle itself and from the adventures found on the levels.  Therefore, I began to look for another way to implement the project. <br><br>  He took out a loan of 120,000 rubles for the creation of a prototype in order to show the players that I was creating at all, and then start crowdfunding. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/54b/f67/9f0/54bf679f065243408b820014d83aebb2.jpg"><br>  <i>"This blow can be done in the game itself"</i> <br><br>  I planned the game for mobile platforms, but, not knowing how to distribute the keys that made the pre-order, I switched to PC development, because on Steam this is much easier to do. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/498/291/981/498291981ff648939dd6f66a275027f7.jpg"><br>  <i>"Battle of the heroes against each other"</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/01c/fb7/f63/01cfb7f630d942499e5de28c69949936.jpg"><br>  <i>"Joint passage of heroes"</i> <br><br>  He conducted more than 40 Skype interviews for the positions of a programmer, artist and animator, and one interesting thing happened.  According to the results of the trial assignment, the people who requested a higher price sometimes performed the assignment worse than those whose price for the service was lower.  Therefore, you need to conduct at least 5 interviews for one position. <br><br>  At first we drew 2D characters, but then we switched to 3D models, because it was much easier to animate them.  Accordingly, I had to change the background. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/0a3/add/9cb/0a3add9cb945451fb5922127facf7790.jpg"><br>  <i>"Hero Transformation"</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/74c/076/5fb/74c0765fbdd5462f87c7148dc2719e9a.jpg"><br>  <i>"I had to change the background"</i> <br><br>  Unfortunately, I found out too late what the Asset Store is.  This resource would seriously save my budget. <br><br>  Developing a game is always a challenge, you always have to find a compromise.  Pull on yourself all the work, I do not advise anyone.  A team of at least two people is absolutely necessary, so that there is someone to discuss this or that idea with. <br><br>  To support the project, I started a group in VC, in which, together with the subscribers, we discussed the project.  They are well helped morally (which is important) and informational. <br><br>  Now the prototype is ready, he liked a large number of players and for me the next test is going on, this is crowdfunding.  4 days have passed, and I already have something to tell, but about this in the next article. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/318656/">https://habr.com/ru/post/318656/</a></p>
