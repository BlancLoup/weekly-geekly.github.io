  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Methodology for creating a selling online store</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  There are many articles and publications online.  However, I decided to write my training manual. <br>  The fact is that, as you understand, the Internet is no longer moderated.  And it is designed so that it keeps everything for a very long time.  According to this, what was relevant a year ago is not relevant now. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  I will not write about how to register a domain, how to open the law.  person or sp.  I think this is the easiest.  And much has been written about this. <br><br>  I want to tell today.  How to make the store make a profit. <br>  All my narration will be based on the fact that you have a competitive product.  And you are adequate prices.  Of course you can not have good prices, but then probably - the conversion will fall. <br><br>  So.  We are creating a shop. <br>  It is very important for us to use all modern technologies now.  After all, there are already a hundred thousand other stores.  We need to knock out your client. <br>  Let's start with the selection of the engine.  I will not advise something.  Each will have specific goals.  Personally, I choose the box engine.  Because I trade in digital technology.  And nothing special from the store is not necessary.  And someone, perhaps trading will be something where you need to do a lot for the unique needs of the store.  Then, it is easier to do the new script right away. <br>  After you decide on the program part - go to the visual.  But before that, carefully review the stores of competitors.  In your area and in other countries.  Print for yourself the perfect option.  After that, start preparing TK for the studio, which will draw and stretch the layout on your script! 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>
        <script>
          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      Perhaps this is the easiest.  Next, we need to think about what the store was prepared for promotion.  And what would the pages of the store sell. <br><br>  After opening the store.  You have three options for how to get a client. <br><ul><li>  advertising (offline, banner, custom articles, etc.) </li><li>  contextual advertising (cheap and cheerful - I choose this option) </li><li>  work with price aggregators (this option should also be used. It may happen that in your region the sale will come mainly from such resources) </li></ul><br><br>  There is another option.  This is the incoming client from the search engine.  You probably know what it is about.  It's about SEO optimization.  But this is our goal.  To which we will strive - to get customers almost for free (these customers are cheaper than everyone else). <br><br>  Therefore, in the next stage of the development of our store, we will deal with two things. <br>  There are many options for working with price aggregators.  Someone allows you to work with them through their admin area, someone asks to send them an Excel file.  But most standardized unloading and it can occur in semi-automatic or automatic mode. <br>  I advise you to go for one of two options.  It or everywhere to keep one price.  Like the store.  Then it is better to have ready-made software that will synchronize prices everywhere.  Or, if the market in your case dictates a different price level at different sites, update it manually. <br>  In this way.  Probably, it would be better for you at the development stage to lay down the possibility to update the prices automatically and everywhere, right away.  This is a great time saver. <br><br>  We now turn to the main thing. <br>  We need to get customers from search engines.  For this, immediately navigate - the process of filling your store will not be fast.  Forget about save-paste. <br>  Only unique text.  Look for a copywriter who will write unique descriptions for each product. <br>  This will give you a huge bonus in front of hundreds of identical shops. <br><br>  However, this is a known truth. <br>  This is what we did. <br><ul><li>  Ordered for each product - a unique selling text. </li><li>  Prepared the most unique pictures for each product </li><li>  For the very best products - we prepare video reviews. </li></ul><br><br>  Thus, we get - a unique, non-template design with a thoughtful interface.  After all, you know that usability is now also a very important point.  We will have a unique selling seo text for each product.  We will try to make video reviews to key positions.  And we will take care of the uniqueness of the pictures. <br><br>  All this gives hope for high conversion. <br><br>  Also, I want to warn everyone who is going to display the store in the top search engines from the very first day.  Do not hurry.  This is before - the sites went to the top quickly.  Now the search engine does not rush to give you bonuses.  need time. <br><br>  My way out - we give our goods for review in well-known online publications.  And they, in turn, direct links to us put. <br>  This gives us very good performance and an excellent foundation. <br><br>  Linking is better from trust sites.  1-3 per week.  Gradually increasing the reference mass. <br><br>  This is a short training manual.  First part.  If it is interesting, I will write in the second part.  About customer loyalty.  Loyal customer - not only will buy from you for many years.  But lead a bunch of friends.  This is an important area.  And very profitable.  But more about that next time ... </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/132155/">https://habr.com/ru/post/132155/</a></p>
