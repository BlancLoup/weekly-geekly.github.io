Namely - how to properly name your site and what elements to use in the title.  Information on this topic, as always, is slightly more than "0".  What is available is in English and describes the technical aspects of hosting a resource or aspects of website design (several links about this at the end of the article).  It remains only to go through trial and error.  On the tradition of the names of sites, numerology and of course, the general points (where do without it? :)), today we will talk. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  There are quite a few tips on the topic of naming a site for Russian and English-speaking zones on the Internet, which boil down to the ‚Äúsimple three‚Äù of rules: 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>
        <script>
          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
    <ul><li>  Short title.  It should be concise, memorable and have such a length that the user can easily type in the address bar of the browser on the phone, without much suffering. </li><li>  The consonance of the site name and domain name. </li><li>  Originality of the name of the resource.  The name that you choose for the site should accurately reflect the essence of the resource activity, while standing out from the crowd of competitors. </li></ul><br><br>  This approach is absolutely fair if we are talking about the Chinese market.  At this place, it seems, we can finish the article.  What further to write about, if everything is clear?  We take a dictionary or translator and begin to ‚Äúconjure‚Äù over the name of the future masterpiece.  So, at least, many of the webmasters I have met, who began their conquest of the ‚Äúeastern lands‚Äù, think. <br><br>  However, there are a couple of points that are not taken into account or are not well understood by our specialists.  Among them: <br><br>  <b>1. The pair name.</b>  Although the era of globalization has reached China, where more and more sites appear that are close in name to Western ones, but the approaches of a thousand-year-old culture do not give up.  In the Chinese tradition, the use of the ‚Äúpaired‚Äù name is considered to be a sign of good taste and is associated with several points: <br><ul><li>  The name is given on the basis of a clear meaning in the semantics of the language.  For example: the name of the largest social network is Renren, the translation value of which means ‚Äúall together‚Äù. </li><li>  The traditional meaning of "couples".  The symbol "2" indicates an easily achievable result.  Can be found in the names of banks. </li><li>  Who would not say, and sometimes it really just sounds beautiful :). </li></ul><br><br>  An example of well-known resources that apply this approach in practice: <br><ul><li>  <a href="http://www.bilibili.com/">www.bilibili.com</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://www.qq.com/">www.qq.com</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://renren.com/">renren.com</a> </li></ul><br><br>  <b>2. Numerological values ‚Äã‚Äãin the names of sites.</b>  Unlike ours or the western region, where the numbers in the names of the sites are quite rare, and often raise questions about the quality of the resource, numerology is extremely common in the Chinese tradition.  It carries more than a complex semantic load, which often complements the ‚Äúverbal‚Äù name. <br><br>  An example of such sites can serve: <br><ul><li>  <a href="http://www.898tele.com/%3Fpk_campaign%3DMegamozg%26pk_kwd%3DArt3">http://www.898tele.com/</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://www.505cents.net/">www.505cents.net</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://news.163.com/">news.163.com</a> </li></ul><br><br>  What exactly do these numbers mean, and which ones can be used? <br><br>  <b>"0"</b> - Complete nothing.  It is infinity and completeness at the same time.  Often used in the designation of higher powers and Gd.  It is used, with the name of the site, only with "positive" numbers, for example - 808. <br><br>  <b>‚Äú1‚Äù</b> - Indicates development, constructive beginning, from which a person wins. <br><br>  <b>‚Äú2‚Äù</b> - Balance and harmony of masculine and feminine.  Sometimes this number is replaced by the word "love."  Great for sites that specialize in wedding products. <br><br>  Despite the positive meaning, ‚Äú2‚Äù as well as ‚Äú3‚Äù, which we will discuss below, requires close attention, in combination with other numbers.  This is due to the fact that they are in the wrong combination, they can easily change the value to a negative one.  For example, "24" means "death is quite possible." <br>  Negative shades are also combinations of 22 and 25. <br><br>  <b>"3"</b> - Life (continuous movement), growth, offspring.  Indicates the development and joy of life.  At the same time, like ‚Äú2‚Äù, it can change the value in the wrong combination.  For example, "34" - withering, imminent unhappiness. <br><br>  <b>"4"</b> - Indicates misfortune, death.  Try to not apply this figure.  Even if you have a phone number that starts or ends with "4", it is better to change it, because  Many potential customers will not want to call him. <br><br>  <b>"5"</b> - Indicates luck, the natural rhythm of life.  In the Chinese tradition, this figure is inextricably linked with the five elements of the World: Wood, Metal, Fire, Earth and Water. <br><br>  <b>"6"</b> - Easy (bringing good luck) solution, smooth flow. <br>  An example in the name of the site: the above news.163.com. <br><br>  <b>"7"</b> - Consonant with the hieroglyph "confidence" and has the same meaning. <br><br>  <b>‚Äú8‚Äù</b> - means ‚Äúmultiplication‚Äù (wealth), ‚Äúabundance‚Äù.  It is also used as a guard and protective sign. <br><br>  <b>"9"</b> - the number of the emperor.  Indicates fullness (life), self-sufficiency, longevity. <br><br>  Thanks for attention! <br><br><h3>  Previous articles: </h3><br><ul><li>  <a href="http://megamozg.ru/post/21272/">Working with China # 2: Top 5 Best VPN Clients for Working with a Chinese Network</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://megamozg.ru/post/20358/">Working with China # 1: How to register with Baidu Webmaster tools</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://vc.ru/p/china-software">Introduction of IT products to the Chinese market - marketing diary</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://sinocom.ru/blog/top-7-provajderov-telefonnyx-nomerov-kitaya/">Top 7 providers of virtual numbers in China</a> </li></ul><br><br><h3>  Useful links: </h3><br><ul><li>  <a href="http://blog.adsmithchina.com/blog/chinese-websites-%25E2%2580%2593-what-you-need-to-know">Why do you need your Chinese website?</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://www.china-briefing.com/news/2015/05/22/best-practices-launching-china-website.html">Best Practices for Launching Your China</a> <br></li></ul></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/297146/">https://habr.com/ru/post/297146/</a></p>
