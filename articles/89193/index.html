      <b>Q: Will there be a game mode against each other?</b> <br>  A: Only Co ‚Äì Op <br><br>  <b>Q: Will the heroine remain silent or will she start participating in the dialogues?</b> <br>  A: She will not speak, but there will be more dialogues, new characters of the game will participate in them <br><br>  <b>Q: Will new features be added to the portal gun, for example a third portal or something?</b> <br>  A: No, the gun will remain as it is, but the world will change, it will give more different possibilities.  A new dimension will be added to the world.  The physics of the portals themselves will be improved - all sorts of rays can penetrate them, etc. <br><br>  <b>Q: Some details have surfaced about the scenario of the game, in particular, that one of the creators of Aperture Science transferred its ‚ÄúI‚Äù to the artificial intelligence GladOS - is this true?</b> <br>  A: There is fragmentary information that Cave Johnson, the creator of Aperture Science, should be in Portal 2 as the main villain.  In general, it is possible.  Johnson is a mad scientist and maybe he put his mind on the GladOS.  By the way, many people, looking at the pictures, thought that Chell had left the laboratory, that the events in Portal 2 would be unfolding in some jungle - nothing of the sort.  The fact that the pictures - this is the same laboratory, but after hundreds of years.  It is not you who have left the lab, this vegetation has penetrated inside.  And we do not know whether Chell will get out of the lab at the end. <br><br>  <b>Q: Will there be other weapons besides the portal gun?</b> <br>  A: No.  No weapons, only portals. <br><br>  <b>Q: Will there be other people in the game?</b> <br>  A: No.  Even in Co ‚Äì Op mode, players control two robots.  Chell is always alone, she does not know if there are any living people in the laboratory and the rest of the world.  On this occasion, Valve employees also said that we should not know the details, there will be very interesting surprises. <br><br>  <b>Q: Will there be a game on PS3?</b> <br>  A: Unknown.  It is known exactly what will be for PC, Mac, XBox 360. <br><br>  <b>Q: How is Aperture Science laboratory connected with the world of Half ‚Äì Life and is it connected at all?</b> <br>  A: It stems from HL2, but it‚Äôs unlikely we will see G-Maine, etc. there.  There will be some links to the world of HL but this is a separate game. <br><br>  <b>Q: When do events happen in Portal 2?</b> <br>  A: Portal 1 occurs immediately after an event in HL2.  Portal 2 - hundreds of years.  Chell passes his tests in the laboratories again and again. <br><br>  <b>Q: What are the chances that we will see P2 in Orange Box along with TEam Fortress 2 and HL2: Episode 3?</b> <br>  A: P2 is a separate product that should not be put into any box sets.  The last time the portal was an experiment, now Valve puts a full rate on it.  The singleplayer time will be much longer this time. <br><br>  <b>Q: Will there be another song in the game, like the final Portal 1?</b> <br>  A: Valve decided to bring more music into the game, but in a way that was a surprise.  For example, when GladOS wants to punish you, it says ‚Äúthree ... two ... one ..." and when you expect the camera to be filled with neurotoxin or something like that happens, jazz starts playing in the camera. <br><br>  <b>Q: Did you learn anything about the character who lived in the first part and wrote ‚Äúcake is a lie‚Äù on the walls there?</b> <br>  A: No, and it is not known whether there will be any traces of it in P2. <br><br>  <b>Q: Why does everything happen in the hundreds of years in the future and how did Chell get there?</b> <br>  A: Valve did not disclose this. <br><br>  <b>Q: How will Co ‚Äì Op work?</b> <br>  A: Players will vary in color, there will be an opportunity to communicate and indicate ‚Äúput the portal here‚Äù and ‚Äúlook here‚Äù, you can switch to the point of view of another character.  It is quite difficult to solve puzzles together, you have to invent complex interaction schemes. <br><br>  Anyone wishing to learn more - welcome to <a href="http://gameinformer.com/b/podcasts/archive/2010/03/26/special-edition-podcast-portal-2.aspx">Gameinformer's Portal 2 Hub</a> . <br><br>  Here is a list of additional topics: <br>  1. <a href="http://gameinformer.com/b/news/archive/2010/03/05/april-cover-revealed.aspx">The cover of a</a> 12 ‚Äì page article about Portal 2, which will be released on gameinformer.com in April. <br>  2. <a href="http://gameinformer.com/b/features/archive/2010/03/08/narbacular-drop.aspx">Narbacular drop</a> , the game is a prototype of the Portal. <br>  3. <a href="http://gameinformer.com/b/features/archive/2010/03/10/opening-the-portal-exploring-portal-s-creation-and-its-ties-to-half-life-2.aspx">How Portal ‚Äì 2 came up</a> <br>  4.
