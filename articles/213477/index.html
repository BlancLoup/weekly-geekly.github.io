A small vote is also offered on the subject. <br><br>  Immediately, I‚Äôll make a reservation that this is not an attempt at fine PR of your company or something like that, but simply a lively interest in the issue.

      I think many of those who are in the subject noticed that recently there has been some excitement around automated testing.  Numerous trainings, seminars, reports, tutorials on how to write, run tests correctly, reviews of tools, frameworks, design approaches, etc.  Most companies involved in web development want to apply self-testing on their projects and get benefits from this in the form of a constant, controlled level of quality and economy, due to the automation of repeatedly repeated checks.  But it often happens the other way around, when resources are spent on maintaining the tests themselves in working condition, and there is no stable result.  I think everyone has come across the phenomenon that tests fall for various reasons (often due to curvature) precisely when it is necessary to make a decision about the possibility of the next release to production.  There are many different reasons for this, but we will not dwell on this now.  Just admit that there are problems and move on. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  But actually the thought - Or maybe it would be a better idea to outsource this business to professionals who have this process debugged to an ideal state, integrate with their CI process and get the finished result in the form of reports without worrying about the infrastructure and training people and other difficulties. , while the internal QA-team leaves the domain expertise, manual testing and the actual writing of test cases, saving on the payroll, since the salaries of the automation testers have already become equal to the salaries of the developers, which  not logical.  In addition, there is a shortage of professionals in the market. <br><br>  Of course, I think there are some problems with outsourcing auto-testing.  I did not come across, I can only guess.  Share if anyone had experience. <br><br>  I tried on the Internet to find companies that offer such services.  I‚Äôve got a small list, and all the companies I‚Äôve found offer comprehensive testing services with non-transparent pricing a-la-phone and we‚Äôll calculate what time it will cost you.  The first thought that comes to mind is that in financial terms this may turn out to be even less profitable than having your own team of auto testers.  And what if there was another model, say, pay per action, at which every action in the browser would be paid: click on an element, select an element from the list, fill in the field, etc.  when writing code + monthly fee for the rental of infrastructure for running tests, depending on the required capacity.  Someone will be quite enough to run tests in 1 thread, someone in 10, someone in 100. <br><br>  With this approach, it would be accurate to calculate that it is more profitable to test manually and what would be cheaper to automate. <br><br>  I invite everyone to share their experiences and opinions in the comments, and if possible, only those who are directly involved in making such decisions are invited to the survey in order to make it representative. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/213477/">https://habr.com/ru/post/213477/</a></p>
