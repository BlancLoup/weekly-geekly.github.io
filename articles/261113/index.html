    <a name="habracut"></a><br>  The thing is that the 75th version was largely devoted to changes "under the hood", the most ambitious since the time of version 1.5 - well familiar with the history of the browser perfectly understand what it says. <br><br>  For the first time ever since (release 1.5 took place in the summer of 2008) one of the key components of K-Meleon's uniqueness, the <b>macro language</b> , was seriously updated.  20 new functions were added to it at once (this will require a separate conversation, but I still have to prepare for it myself). <br>  The functionality of the browser interface with javascript tools has been seriously upgraded and extended through <b>the JSbridge module</b> (here I separately invite not only and not so much to the discussion as to the complicity of JS developers - my qualification, alas, is not enough for not only use, but also for conscious descriptions of this functional.) In any case, we can say that Kameleon makes another step towards extensibility, additional third-party functionality and integration. <br><br>  Now we need people who will actively use all this good, bug report, fix and so on. <br><br>  Another, almost revolutionary, change was the ‚Äúreform‚Äù <b>of the browser's skinning system</b> , although here, almost all the changes occurred ‚Äúinside‚Äù and are mainly interesting to those who are going to start working on creating program interface options.  In general, now it will be much easier and faster to collect visual themes, thanks to the full support of the PNG format with true transparency, rather than its imitation with the help of the ‚Äúmagic vanishing pink‚Äù. <br>  For the user, only the ability to quickly (via GUI settings) change the thickness (height) of toolbars was added immediately.  This can be viewed as an adaptation not only to the different requirements of users, but also to the new ‚Äúiron‚Äù reality with high and ultra-high resolution screens, as well as with touch interfaces (it is clear that it is much more convenient to poke fingers into large buttons). <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d5d/a5a/e0b/d5da5ae0bcf8469d8003655b9f713520.png"><br><br>  All the changes described today look more like investments in the future: they need developers and advanced users who will use all this.  It is important that K-Meleon is confidently fixed in the status of not just a browser, but a scalable (geometrically and functionally) platform that can be flexibly adapted to different environments and needs. <br>  And before, the browser could, if desired, be turned into almost a full-fledged basic working shell, and now even more so. <br><br>  <b>Of the remaining innovations, the</b> most important for the user is, perhaps, the <i>integration of various Firefox tools</i> , which makes the cross-browser experience much more consistent and compatible: here and gradual migration towards the native for the new Firewall interface settings through about: preferences, and support for the download manager (which was never before in KM), and, of course, the greatest possible at the present stage of overcoming architectural differences, allowing Chameleon to use some (not so small) part of the Big Wall extensions  ta fox.  (At this point, I again call into our ranks experienced developers, because it is possible - and necessary, as I see it - there is still a lot to improve and add, but professionals of all kinds of coding are required). <br><br>  In addition, the own functionality has been seriously refined - in particular, the sessions module got rid of some annoying vintage glitches, learned to remember the last active tab, and the architectural sessions are finally allocated into a separate json file, which can also be seen as a contribution to future convenience of working with sets open pages. <br><br>  The spelling checker module, dropped from the past, 74th release, was re-implemented in the browser. <br><br>  <b>For the rest,</b> there was an unequal struggle with the old and newly manifested glitches (crashes, resource leaks, improper functioning), and many of them were defeated. <br>  The 75th, of course, is not 100% sinless, but we can safely say that it is better than the 74th, not only by the breadth of functionality, but also by the stability and quality of implementation of what users have been used to for a long time. <br><br>  The release will not become a point of frozen narcissism: first, it has already revealed some annoying (but fortunately, minor) bugs;  secondly, Dorian and the community already now have a certain amount of accumulated material for a minor update. <br><br>  <b>Well, the plans</b> , as always, are great.  The next version, apparently, will immediately be assembled on the 38th engine, but the FF Hello functionality is not yet shining at Cameleoshe, according to Dorian, however, the author‚Äôs wording more likely implies a fundamental possibility of integrating this feature than a hard rejection of this ideas. <br><br>  And yet the main thing - it is their own branded chips KM.  There is no doubt that their spectrum will expand again: it is felt that excitement and the fan accompanying the development have returned to Dorian. <br><br>  If I, as an evangelist of the project, succeed in attracting new developers to it, then everything will be altogether wonderful.  And I believe that those who wish will appear sooner or later.  And it is here, in Russia - the country that has shown and is still the most interested in the browser.  Let me remind you that 20% of all its downloads on Sourceforge are made by Russians. <br><br>  <b>By the way</b> , K-Meleon is quite available on this site without any ‚Äúadvertising-infectious loads‚Äù, however, in light of the scandal that has recently broken out with a new force, the project is considering (in the background) alternative placement options. <br><br>  <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/kmeleon/files/k-meleon/75.0/K-Meleon75.0.exe/download">K-Meleon 75 installer</a> / <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/kmeleon/files/k-meleon/75.0/K-Meleon75.0.7z/download">K-Meleon 75 portable</a> <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/kmeleon/files/k-meleon/75.0/K-Meleon75.0.7z/download"><br></a> <br>  <b>PS</b> Finally, I owe you a little to intrigue, therefore, I remind you that, as I promised, immediately after the release I will start preparing the <i>K-Meleon Pro</i> assembly - adapted primarily for the Runet, which is expanded, tuned and contains some of the newest improvements that were not included in the official release including the author. <br>  The name as if hints that the assembly will continue in the first place the traditions of the Russian assemblies of the same name from members of the Russian team, and not my last Twin.  Nevertheless, I will try to have something firm in it and from my approach. <br>  In general, we will try not to disappoint after Dorian!
