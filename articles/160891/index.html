Honestly, I practically do not waste time on the games themselves.  But the thought does not leave me that I have thought of a product with high potential.  Maybe I‚Äôll look stubborn to you, but I really think so, I feel it, and I believe it. <br><br>  The idea of ‚Äã‚Äãmy game, as it is now fashionable, easily fits in one phrase: <b>User + ES vs User</b> . <br>  The ES in this case is the <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25DD%25EA%25F1%25EF%25E5%25F0%25F2%25ED%25E0%25FF_%25F1%25E8%25F1%25F2%25E5%25EC%25E0">Expert System</a> , similar to that used on the <a href="http://ru.akinator.com/">Akinator</a> .

    <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  The game, like ‚Äú20 questions‚Äù, ‚Äú7 hats‚Äù, I don‚Äôt know what they call it: when one user thinks of <i>someone</i> , and the second <i>one has to</i> guess this <i>someone by</i> asking only closed questions (yes / no).  After the correct answer is given, users switch roles.  As an option, guessing at the same time and changing roles in turn, with a time interval. <br><br>  The trick of my idea is that the Expert System (Akinator or similar) also plays on the side of the guessing user.  Thus, giving the user the opportunity to ask questions not only and not so much with text (voice), but by choosing, for example, a ready-made question from the top 3 questions of Akinator. <br><br>  This is approximately how it might look like in the version of the game One to One: <br>  The first user thinks of, say, a character, and writes his name, an enterter, into the form on the game page.  For the second user, the game begins.  Before him are two forms: <br><br>  The first form: "Top 3 Akinator Questions": <br>  - Do you know your character? <br>  - your female character? <br>  - Does your character live in Russia? <br><br>  Each question is clickable (the course of the game).  Next to the questions there is a button, a la one-armed gangster - you click on it, and the questions change to others.  Well, if for example you do not like the options that exist.  One click - minus one unit of game currency, for example.  Or some other functionality or interactive can be hung up on this button.  If you don‚Äôt make it the main move button at all. <br><br>  The second form: History of questions / answers of the current session of the game + percentage of 3 (5) responses suggested by Akinator, which can also be clicked like previous "top-3 questions".  Plus, it should be possible to enter (speak) the question yourself.  After clicking on the selected option, the move goes to the first user.  Well, everything seems clear.  He answers - Yes or No. <br><br>  I repeat, I‚Äôm not a welder in game devs at all, but all sorts of viralities, player ratings come to mind: records, guessing time, minimum number of questions, etc.  etc.  Plus, I think we need an opportunity for players to evaluate the game that they have just played and their opponent: there are stars to choose, likes, something else like that. <br><br>  I also really like the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãa group game.  When one user thinks, and the group guesses, asking questions in turn.  Or everyone plays classic "tarantinki" for a while.  But there it is generally very cool to come up with, and I'm in this complete layman.  Regarding the options of monetization and my phrase about game currency - here, as you understand, I also don‚Äôt understand the subject. <br><br>  The first thing that I did after the emergence of the idea was that it was described by the lead Tarantinot in the Rain, Alex Dubas.  Then, briefly outlined his idea to representatives of Akinator.  Fidbek currently from them never received.  Having waited a bit, I created a post-question with a description of the game and a request to evaluate the idea on a habr.  Then he opened the ‚Äúcompany‚Äù section, blew away old Skype contacts and set up a spam channel with a description of his idea in the direction of game developers, publishers and all those who, in my humble opinion, could help.  Therefore, if suddenly my spam gave someone an inconvenience - I sincerely apologize;  pursued other goals. <br><br>  draw something </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/160891/">https://habr.com/ru/post/160891/</a></p>
