Can make plans? <br><br>  A little more than a year we have been making our project <a href="https://ru.yougile.com/">management system</a> .  Not so long ago, the base of active users exceeded 1000 and there was a great opportunity to study the statistics of how companies approach the organization of processes. <br><br>  What do successful teams do and what do not collapse for a week?  You can answer stupid questions: what is more important - assign an executor to each task or set deadlines, and maybe the most important is to set priorities?  Is there an action that significantly increases the life of the project?

    <img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ri/za/96/riza96zbgl0zompqtpldsbtrhue.png"><br><br>  <b>And it turned out that there is a simple answer.</b>  Having found it, we abruptly suspended work on the functions and the whole team focused on the mobile application ... <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h3>  Experiment </h3><br>  We identified groups of users who, after registration, focused on a particular function in the system.  Then they considered the daily indicator of returns for employees of these companies.  ( <a href="https://youtu.be/URiIsrdplbo">Daily Retention Rate</a> - a video that inspired the experiment).  In other words, we looked at how the user is converted at early stages - whether he perceives the system as a place for setting tasks or, for example, wants to control processes as much as possible;  tried to understand how long it lingers in the system, depending on the start. <br><br>  It seemed that such an approach would simply let the group know which system is best suited.  However, the truth is that the whiteboard on the wall is suitable for any organization scheme, only the will in the team would be to constantly use the board. <br><br>  Thus, a side, but much more interesting result of our experiments turned out to be that you can find out at which approach the project activity fades out in a couple of months, and in which it lives for a long time regardless of the results.  From statistics one can draw conclusions about the usefulness of actions when organizing a project. <br><br>  Most interesting samples could not be found.  As a rule, the action we have chosen does not say anything and does not affect the life of the beginning team.  For example, assigning tasks to performers is of no particular importance;  Those companies that emphasize this at the beginning of use have the same return rate as the average for the entire base.  It is also important to note that all samples were approximately the same size.  There is no situation that we simply selected companies that have passed a higher barrier. <br><br>  <b>But the two groups gave fundamental differences from the average.</b> <br><br><h3>  results </h3><br>  <b>The brightest negative pattern is a large number of generated tasks.</b>  The activity schedule of such companies falls quite quickly and tends to asymptote near zero. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/da0/b2b/ce2/da0b2bce22104b75bdfa622631f02a8e.png"><br><br>  Companies that generate many tasks (more than 20 per day per person in the first week), after 100 days, will exist only with a 4% probability. <br><br>  In reality, it looks like that one very energetic manager endlessly sets tasks, breaking the project as soon as he understands, practically doesn‚Äôt discuss anything, demands implementation, becomes enraged when the tasks completed do not give a general result.  No matter how absurd this example may seem, it occurs often. <br><br>  <b>The brightest positive pattern is a large amount of communication, questions.</b> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/f29/68d/8c5/f2968d8c553445989b15c9711e48b7fc.png"><br><br>  Companies that in the first days gain more than 10 messages per team member survive 100 days in the system with a probability of 42%. <br><br>  In practice, it looks like a few tasks are generated, decomposition occurs in the task description, several people are connected to the majority of tasks and lead discussions, there is no one most active participant, the structure of the team is flat, many questions are formulated.  As a rule, this is a team of equal participants or with a competent leader. <br><br>  <b>In general, asking a question is ten times better than setting a task.</b> <br><br><h3>  Development priorities </h3><br>  The experiment <a href="https://ru.yougile.com/">YouGile</a> experiment had a strong influence.  No, we did not ask more questions to each other.  We changed the ideology, made a small turn in the development of the product.  Now we focus on organizing the interaction of teams around tasks. <br><br>  Unlike the whiteboard, the control system should suck in like Facebook sucks.  Every day, review project tasks, ask questions on time, communicate - all this should be the norm for the whole team.  In an ideal world, such a system should allow organizing 100 people as easily as a startup out of 5. <br><br>  If communication is so important, the availability of a mobile version should significantly increase the chances of success in companies.  We suspended the work on the functions and the whole team began to finish the mobile application.  The task was to ensure that the emphasis in the project management system was on communication. <br><br>  It turned out interesting, we and a few close companies from among the testers like.  All communication finally transferred to the system and became perfectly structured by task. <br><br>  Here is the <b>list of all projects</b> .  When you click on a particular board opens and you can view all the tasks. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/b65/efb/644/b65efb6448084a3589f265a18ac476de.jpg"><br><br>  The second button in the bottom menu allows you to view <b>all the task dialogs</b> .  There is a division of the dialogs for which you have been notified and the dialogs that are available to you for viewing, but for some reason you have not been added to the notification. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/16d/abb/bb1/16dabbbb1ce44d318b9ab17587b0c6ba.jpg"><br><br>  The third button in the bottom menu opens the <b>list of participants of the whole company</b> and allows you to conduct personal correspondence.  No one except you and the other person has access to it. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/75d/cc7/437/75dcc74377e34f5985377837dd492cc9.jpg"><br><br>  From the launch of the mobile version, we are waiting for the growth rate of returns by 10%, in practice this means that companies will be 10% longer to rest on before leaving the project.  Maybe someone will spend more time in vain, working on a deliberately dead idea, but our task is to ensure that the whole team is involved in the process. <br><br>  How to collect statistics using the mobile version, add a new chart here. <br><br>  Site system - <a href="https://yougile.com/">yougile.com</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/329752/">https://habr.com/ru/post/329752/</a></p>
