It turns out that the released domains are a national treasure with value added. <br><br>  Let's discuss how to make this wealth equally accessible to all market participants - both registrars and customers. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  Equality Registrars </h4><br><br>  Now the registrars themselves delete their domains, and are more likely to re-register them again at the time of removal.  Registration is made either on themselves to hold an auction, or on some of his client.  Technically, this is implemented by successively sending a request to delete a domain and an application for registering a domain.

      Registrars with a large customer base receive a bonus that influences pricing: a registrar can sell (usually through partners) zero-profit domains in the hope of earning a year after part of the domains are released.  This is not bad, just like that. <br><br>  It is very easy to equalize registrars in rights to vacated domains - it is enough for the Technical Center to delete domains: <br><ol><li>  domains are deleted by the registry itself, either at the same time (peak load) or within an hour (the load decreases, but charges may arise that one of the registrars knew the time of deletion of the domain and therefore managed to register it); </li><li>  to register released domains, a separate server with other access details is used (the increasing load on the Technical Center does not affect registrars who register new domains and transactions with existing domains). </li></ol><br>  This is the scheme used in gTLD registries. <br><br>  It should be understood that such a decision may provoke: <br><ul><li>  conclusion of technological agreements for registration of released domains between large and small registrars </li><li>  increase in the number of registrars accredited only for domain interception.  In the West, this has already come, see how many registrars with the word ‚ÄúEnom‚Äù in the title in the ICANN list - <a href="http://icann.org/en/registrars/accredited-list.html">http://icann.org/en/registrars/accredited-list.html</a> . </li></ul><br>  Alternatively, do as the same ICANN, and consider registrars not one by one, but unite into groups by affiliation (the two companies have the same director or the same shareholders) and issue one connection to the registry of released domains for the whole group. <br><br>  But as you understand, this is still a half-measure, which is easy to manage - if there is demand for the released domains, an increase in the number of registrars cannot be avoided. <br><br><h4>  Total Equality in the Distribution of Liberated Domains </h4><br><br>  Here we need to remember why this problem is solved at all. <br><br>  The task of the Coordination Center in the development of the Russian segment of the Internet.  This is not just an increase in the number of domain registrations, but the appearance of high-quality content on them, the involvement of users in the use of these resources. <br><br>  Registration of each vacated domain is essentially a mini- <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunrise_Period">sunrise period</a> , and as is customary when opening domain zones, it would be good for the domain to go to someone who makes a quality resource on it, that is, its actions will meet the objectives of the Co-ordination Center for the Development of Runet. <br><br>  Determine a decent in two ways: <br><ol><li>  using the money that he is ready to offer for the domain.  It is assumed that those who are willing to pay more for a domain will be able to create a decent website on it; </li><li>  with the help of a certain commission that will collect applications with a description of the project implementation on such a domain and decide who will give the domain.  For example, this is done now by the future administrator of the XXX domain - <a href="http://www.icmregistry.com/founder/">http://www.icmregistry.com/founder/</a> (but this is done when starting the domain, it is obvious that it is impossible to do this for the released domains). </li></ol><br><br>  Thus, it can be regulated only from the standpoint of the economy, and talk about profit on the national wealth is inappropriate here. <br><br>  How to implement it?  I am opposed to an auction scheme with a bid increase and a separate auction service.  Everything should be as simple as possible. <br><br>  The idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe Dutch auction - the domain is deleted, and it can immediately register any registrar to anyone, at least for yourself, BUT: <br><ol><li>  using separate details of the registrar's access to the Technical Center; </li><li>  for 500 thousand rubles within 5 days, after 10 days for 250 thousand, after 15 days for 100 thousand, after 20 - for 50 thousand, and so on.  After a couple of months, the domain is available for registration through the usual registrar access interfaces to the Technical Center. </li></ol><br>  According to this scheme: <br><ul><li>  the registrar can register for himself - why not, he is also a market participant; </li><li>  Coordination Center gets more money and develops Runet; </li><li>  the user sees a list of all released domains and can buy something in real time.  Each registrar decides how much money to take from the client in excess of the amount paid to the Technical Center. </li></ul><br>  By the way, Verisign recently received a <a href="http://domainnamewire.com/2011/01/20/verisign-devises-way-to-sell-more-expiring-domain-names/">patent for a similar scheme</a> , but they have the opposite idea - to reduce prices so that the vacated domain can be bought again. <br><br>  And what do you think about this?  Is there a topic for discussion? <br><br>  - Dmitry Deniskin, <br>  <a href="http://www.reggi.ru/">Reggi.Ru</a> registrar general manager </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/112876/">https://habr.com/ru/post/112876/</a></p>
