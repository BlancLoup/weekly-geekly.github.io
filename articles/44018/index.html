  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Freelance House Ithaca. We finish building.</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The project of freelancing Ithaca has already been discussed a couple of times at Habr√©: we tried to develop the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãco-working further.  It turned out a kind of co-living. <br><br>  For those unfamiliar with the project - an idea in brief: we are finishing the construction of a house - near Alushta, <a name="habracut"></a>  near the forest on the mountain, a 15-minute walk from the sea down.  12 rooms will be rented all year round - all with a view of the sea, from 18 to 35 sq. M., With all amenities, partly with kitchens.  Near the house is a garden of 20 acres with a preserved piece of oak forest.  The house was intended for use as a hotel, but we changed the concept and create a co-living and co-working base for freelancers. <br><br>  The essence of the project is not so much in renting rooms as in offering a set of opportunities for eco-friendly living and productive work: the Crimea, proximity to the sea, forest-vineyards around the house, the Internet via 4m dedicated lines (for now - up to 4 Mbit / s, later - more), Wi-Fi in the house and in the courtyard, swimming pool, cinema hall, fitness equipment, saunas, parking, library, record library, video library, cleaning, laundry, services of a cook and driver with a car, etc ... <br><img src="http://www.itaka.crimea.ua/img/house/5/151_orig.jpg" alt="image"><br>  In this post we want to tell about the current state of construction as of the beginning of November 2008.

      It all started once from this (retaining wall in 3 floors, October 2005 :) <br><img src="http://www.itaka.crimea.ua/img/terra/15_174_orig.jpg" alt="image"><br>  Crisis - crisis, and construction - stroykovo.  Over the summer, we picked up speed and unstoppable (at least - for now :) we are moving towards the launch of the House.  The house grew and began to grow into a garden - the interior and exterior. <br><br>  With the exception of trifles, work on the design of the facade and laying tiles on terraces and balconies have been completed.  It remains to equip the blind area and storm drain, we will complete this work by the end of November. <br><br>  The house has completed the installation of all communications (electricity, water, gas, heating, sewage, air conditioning, ventilation and wiring of underfloor heating in bathrooms), made ties in the rooms for laying laminate, 10 rooms are already finished with plasterboard (this is about a quarter of all rooms), begins installation of interior doors, radiators and sanitary equipment. <br><img src="http://www.itaka.crimea.ua/img/terra/15_175_orig.jpg" alt="image"><br>  The wastewater treatment unit is working (it discharges decontaminated water for irrigation and solid sediment at the outlet). By the beginning of December a boiler will be installed and the heating and hot water supply will be started. <br><br>  In the garden (he is a forest), we built 2 streams, each flowing into its own small lake - large and small.  On the banks of the brooks and lakes will be built areas for seating (with sockets and lights), separated from each other by plants and paths for movement. <br><img src="http://www.itaka.crimea.ua/img/terra/15_177_orig.jpg" alt="image"><br><img src="http://www.itaka.crimea.ua/img/terra/15_180_orig.jpg" alt="image"><br>  To create a landscape that is closed to others, we built an artificial slope (in the photo, it was planted with a lawn), resting on a wall separating the wood from our garden and a neighbor's fence.  In the spring we plant a slope with plants and lay them with pebbles - for heavenly beauty. <br><img src="http://www.itaka.crimea.ua/img/terra/15_181_orig.jpg" alt="image"><br><img src="http://www.itaka.crimea.ua/img/terra/15_182_orig.jpg" alt="image"><br>  In March of the following year, we will plant various coniferous and evergreen plants, mainly Crimean endemics (different junipers, Crimean pine, strawberry tree, cypress, thuya, etc.) in the rest of the woods.  We want to maximally simulate the Crimean mountain forest, in which the oaks are mixed with different conifers.  We have already planted 11 bushes of the Crimean juniper - the very variety that smells of wood and that fills the air around with pine aroma. <br><img src="http://www.itaka.crimea.ua/img/terra/15_183_orig.jpg" alt="image"><br>  In front of the house we break a regular garden - with flowerbeds in which all kinds of ornamental and cultivated plants will flourish, areas for rest and work, playful-light green paths and two brooding purple square ponds with gurgling fountains (while one is ready, the second is being built). <br><img src="http://www.itaka.crimea.ua/img/terra/15_184_orig.jpg" alt="image"><br><img src="http://www.itaka.crimea.ua/img/terra/15_185_orig.jpg" alt="image"><br>  All street works on land management, terracing, preparation of holes for plants for planting in the spring, arrangement of paths, ponds, etc.  we plan to complete by mid-December of this year. <br><br>  It remains a little :) to finish the decoration, buy furniture, place toilet bowls and coffee tables in artistic confusion, fill the pool with sea water and fill the kitchen with equipment, connect the Internet and satellite TV, hang out light bulbs and indecent pictures, arrange ficuses and crocuses - and wait for the guests :) <br><br>  Because of the general political chaos in Ukraine and the economic brothel in the world, we don‚Äôt undertake to make predictions about the launch date of the House - too much depends on funding, but it depends on the course of our business.  We are still working hard to open by May 2009. <br><br>  Interested - follow the news on our website <a href="http://www.itaka.crimea.ua/">www.itaka.crimea.ua</a> .  And see you soon! <br>  habracut&gt; </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/44018/">https://habr.com/ru/post/44018/</a></p>
