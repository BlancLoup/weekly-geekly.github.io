    <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  RAD Studio XE5 is a software package that includes Delphi XE5, C ++ Builder XE5 and HTML5 Builder.  Each of the products included in RAD Studio XE5 is designed to learn one of the most advanced programming languages: Pascal, Delphi, C, C ++, HTML5, PHP, and JavaScript.  These programming environments are among the most popular due to their visual clarity, simplicity and high level of ergonomic use.  All of them are based on the principle of "visual programming", which provides a low threshold for entry - a very important advantage from the point of view of novice programmers.  These environments have an interface commonality, so the study of any of the product as part of RAD Studio XE5 allows you to gain universal knowledge and skills, including the development of mobile applications. <br>  Programming skills developed by students should maximally cover existing operating systems and devices, including mobile platforms.  This is a very important aspect in terms of understanding the general principles of programming.  In addition, knowledge generation must meet the needs of the modern software development industry, and this is impossible within a single platform.  RAD Studio XE5 allows you to create applications for Windows (including Windows 8), Mac OS, iOS and Android.  Support for iPad and iPhone devices, as well as smartphones and tablets running Android, is a powerful additional incentive in project training, creating entertainment and learning applications.  The popularity of mobile devices among the younger generation increases the level of interest in the learning process.  You can get acquainted with the capabilities of RAD Studio XE5 on our website <a href="http://www.embarcadero.com/ru/products/rad-studio">www.embarcadero.com/ru/products/rad-studio</a> <br><br>  The special price is set for the following editions: <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ Professional - allows you to create full-featured native-applications for computers, tablets and smartphones with built-in or local database.  Revision can be used in basic programming courses. <br>  ‚Ä¢ Enterprise - contains all the functions of the Professional edition, as well as opportunities for creating web applications, client-server applications and multi-tier database applications.  Enterprise also allows you to perform full two-way UML modeling with several types of diagrams, code and model synchronization, documentation creation and design patterns.  Use of the editorial recommended in the case if programming is a core discipline and students are focused on obtaining a profession related to software development. <br>  ‚Ä¢ Architect - supports all Enterprise edition features and provides additional powerful tools for database modeling and design: reverse engineering, analyzing and optimizing databases, automatically generating database code based on models for direct design, creating logical and physical models based on data extracted from databases and script files, work with easy-to-read and navigate charts, improved bi-directional comparison and integration of models and database structures.  The editors are designed for in-depth study of programming and database theory, intended for the training of highly qualified programmers and database specialists. <br><br>  <a href="http://www.embarcadero.com/ru/products/rad-studio/product-editions">Editors</a> Comparison <a href="http://www.embarcadero.com/ru/products/rad-studio/product-editions">www.embarcadero.com/ru/products/rad-studio/product-editions</a> <br><br>  Special prices for educational licenses available for the promotion: <br>  RAD Studio XE5 Professional - $ 59 (regular price $ 99) <br>  RAD Studio XE5 Enterprise - $ 179 (regular price $ 299) <br>  RAD Studio XE5 Architect - $ 239 (regular price $ 399) <br><br>  <b>In addition, starting November 1, 2013, we are changing the terms of delivery of educational licenses and expanding the possibilities for their use.</b>  <b>By purchasing educational licenses for RAD Studio XE5 for organizing the educational process, an educational institution can receive for free ten times more special additional licenses for students.</b>  These additional licenses can only be used on students 'and students' home computers and only to prepare for programming classes and homework.  T.e.  if the school acquires 100 educational licenses from RAD Studio XE5 Enterprise, then it receives another 1000 licenses from RAD Studio XE5 Enterprise for use by students and teachers on home computers.  These licenses cannot be installed on the computers of the school.  Licenses for students are valid for one year, after which they can be renewed upon written request from an educational institution - as long as this version of the educational product is supported by Embarcadero.  Also, the right to use such licenses is maintained only during the period while the student (student) is studying at this educational institution. <br><br></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/203246/">https://habr.com/ru/post/203246/</a></p>
