  <section class="page js-page"><h1>ISDEF-2016 conference in Kazan: why it was cool</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  If you are engaged in IT business, then you are very much got various conferences on this topic.  A compulsory foreigner (jumping on the stage and uttering utter banalities - which always sounds a little better in English), a dismal representative of the vendor with a translated corp presentation, a prematurely fat young girl, rubbing something about startups, well, of course, all sorts of marketers, optimizers and business -kouchi <br><br>  <a href="http://isdef.org/">ISDEF is</a> not like that because it was created by people who really work in the IT business - and it was created for itself.  Initially, ISDEF (officially a non-profit organization with an office in Moscow) was a closed club of software exporters (which can only be reached by 2 recommendations from existing members and approved by the others), which discussed closed and often very sensitive issues related to software export and advancement in the West.  In the past 2 years, a course has been taken for greater openness and attraction of new members, and it seems that he has begun to justify himself. <br><br>  I am an ISDEF member since 2010, and for the first time participated in a conference in 2006, and I would like to share my impressions of the last conference, which was held April 21-22 in Kazan.  It was the so-called spring small ISDEF, which is traditionally held outside Moscow - this time there were about 120 participants. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  My main impression of ISDEF is unreal openness.  You can catch a button (or rather make an appointment through the official app) of any speaker or participant and torture about everything that has become painful.  And there is someone to catch - Elcomsoft (these are the ones who won the trial from Adobe), Fast Reports (who introduced their format to the FIU and IFTS), representatives of foreign registrars and even normal lawyers who really understand IT issues and do not bill 600 euros for 5 minutes of conversation about the shortcomings of offshore and features of the CIC.  But this does not mean that if a person makes a modest software, he will have nothing to do among bison - on the contrary, such small companies and even entrepreneurs in ISDEF also have a lot of useful things, and it is there that one can learn to achieve a lot with small forces.

      Reports are practically all really useful, clarify a lot of features, invisible from the outside and often give a fresh, unusual look at your own problems. <br><br>  From the conference in Kazan, I personally made at least two super-usefulness - currency control can be taught to do without acts (!), And the CP method for compiling working product descriptions. <br>  Other topics of this conference that were interesting to me were how to sell software in Latin America and where to hire and how to raise really useful marketers. <br><br>  If you make a report, then in 90% of cases this report is based on real events.  Some events include serving time in foreign prisons, some less dramatic, but almost always useful. <br>  Personal communication, in my opinion, is even more useful.  This is the only way to get a list of working resources for the promotion of highly specialized products, learn the method of reducing the cost of advertising in print media and understand the very difficult logic of Google‚Äôs actions in some cases. <br><br>  ISDEF initially focused on those who export software products, but now has expanded significantly with an impressive list of outsourcers and integrators from all over the country, and this is very cool as it adds new dimensions to understanding what is really happening in the real IT industry. in our country, and not in the magic quadrants and custom articles. <br><br>  Sitting in your niche, even communicating on ‚Äúyour‚Äù forums, you ‚Äúturn sour‚Äù and lose your sense of reality, or even your taste for work, and ISDEF fixes it and gives a powerful incentive to action. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/300392/">https://habr.com/ru/post/300392/</a></p>
