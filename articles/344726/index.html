We are launching the third partnership course - <a href="https://otus.pw/7AGr/">PHP Developer</a> , where we together with Avito prepared the program, and now we are thinking whether we should do a special course on frameworks separately.  The first was Symfony. <br><br>  <b>A bit of history</b> <br><br>  Symfony is one of the most popular web development frameworks in the world.

      It has come a long way from a fully integrated full-stack framework with back office in Symfony 1.x to a framework that has become a development of the Java community, and contains components inspired by JEE in the Symfony2 version. <br><br>  Initially, Symfony2 required PHP 5.2.7, but PHP 5.3, which was only released at that time, had a new object-oriented model, so SensioLabs immediately made this version mandatory.  Already after Symfony used Composer, completed the documentation and completely translated it into English. <br><br>  Almost immediately, the migration of large open-source projects to Symfony began: OroCRM, EzPublish, Drupal8, PHPBB, PrestaShop, Piwik and many others - some of them completely switched to this framework, and some used only individual software components.  Of particular note is Drupal8 - perhaps it was not the very first project, but certainly one of the largest CMS on the market. <br><br>  The ability to use only individual Symfony software components allowed us to enrich the ecosystem with specialized software solutions.  This displaced the Standard Edition framework (the so-called ‚Äúfull edition‚Äù or ‚Äúmeta-package‚Äù), which could no longer be the answer to pressing business questions.  Therefore, in 2017, the creator of Symfony announced that version 3.4 for it will be the last. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ig/va/ja/igvajagj-xn0rcryjknqxumt28y.jpeg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  A partial list of the most famous projects using symfony: <br><br><ul><li>  Framework for Sylius eCommerce; </li><li>  Delicious social bookmarking service; </li><li>  API Platform - specialized framework for RESTful API design; </li><li>  Laravel is an affordable, RAD-oriented framework; </li><li>  Oro Platform and its associated ecosystem: Oro CRM, Akeneo, OroCommerce and Marello; </li></ul><br>  <b>New Breath - Symfony Flex</b> <br><br>  The Flex plugin for Composer is a future replacement for the Standard Edition.  It will make the development of symfony applications much easier. <br><br>  The developer will be able to select and add the dependencies he needs using the YAML format files.  They will explain to Flex what to do: add a dependency, configure and register a bundle, or, for example, create a folder. <br><br>  You can find ‚Äúrecipes‚Äù for Flex in the officially approved SensioLabs catalog.  Besides it, there is also a public source, where everyone can add their own recipe and make it accessible to everyone. <br><br>  To release the RESTful API in 2017 using Flex, you need to refer to the Platform API.  It is available through Flex, so in order to get a fully working application, just one command is enough. <br><br>  Many people believe that the main focus of the Symfony project is not on the framework itself, but on maintaining high-quality software systems and their detailed documentation, and I cannot disagree with them.  I think this conclusion was influenced by the relative success of Symfony 3 and the popularity of software solutions like Akeneo.  In my opinion, the symfony team is moving in the right direction :) <br><br>  The Composer plugin is compatible with symfony 3.3 and does not depend at all on the release of symfony 4, so you can now start trying and experimenting. <br><br>  <b>Symfony in 2017</b> <br><br>  If you want to quickly understand the API Platform, Akeneo, Marello, Sylius, Drupal8, Laravel or the Symfony Standard Edition framework, then learning about the Symfony ecosystem can help you a lot.  It is worth paying attention to the following points: <br><br><ul><li>  How a symfony application reads an HTTP request and returns a response; </li><li>  How a symfony application creates and makes available objects (called ‚Äúservices‚Äù); </li><li>  How a symfony application sends and monitors events during its life cycle; </li><li>  How to create such events; </li></ul><br>  <b>Symfony components</b> <br><br>  Symfony components are well documented, supported by a huge community and are constantly evolving - for which we love them very much. <br><br>  The use of specific components and their study certainly depends on the project.  But these libraries, in my opinion, are the most useful: <br><br><ul><li>  Component Console: provides a full-fledged console with arguments and parameter settings that are essential for PHP in CLI mode; </li><li>  The Debug and VarDumper components: provide improved stack control in case of an error and a dump function as a replacement for the var_dump; </li><li>  The Finder and Filesystem: components provide a convenient API for searching and manipulating folders and files; </li><li>  The components of Polyfill- *: allow an application to use functions that are not available due to the PHP version or due to the lack of the necessary PHP extensions; </li></ul><br>  All these components are used in the largest PHP projects and can work "autonomously". <br><br>  Here is a brief overview, which, in general, makes you look in this direction, as the first special course for a separate course. <br><br>  THE END <br><br>  As always, your opinions are interesting either in the comments or on our <a href="https://otus.pw/XyFd/">Open House Day</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/344726/">https://habr.com/ru/post/344726/</a></p>
