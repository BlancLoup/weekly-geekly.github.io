  <section class="page js-page"><h1>GMP: week before, week after</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  A week has passed since the announcement of the results of the competition for the creation of NPP.  Penguin Software still has about the same amount of time before signing a state contract.  "Discussion" of the topic settled down somewhat.  Therefore, now, when emotions are spilled out, I would like to present facts that the authors of numerous comments and articles did not even bother to look at.  Although their study could have cooled many hot heads from the accusations of "Penguin Software" in all mortal sins ... <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  On August 15, the terms of the contest were published on the <a href="http://zakupki.gov.ru/pgz/public/action/orders/info/order_lot_list_info/show%3FnotificationId%3D1379969%3D">website of</a> the state procurement website, the 4th lot of which was called ‚ÄúDevelopment of prototypes of basic software and hardware components of the national software platform and documents regulating the order of assembly, acceptance, placement and operation of software solutions in the Algorithm and Program Fund 04-11) ‚Äù. <br><br>  I must say that the topic of the NPP was first raised in 2010.  On October 20, 2010, <a href="http://xn--80aealotwbjpid2k.xn--p1ai/gov/results/12932/">the</a> Government of the Russian Federation No. 1815-p approved the state program of the Russian Federation ‚ÄúInformation Society (2011‚Äì2020)‚Äù.  In this program, the National Software Platform was interpreted as a set of domestic software solutions for use in research and educational activities, as well as in government bodies.

      On April 1, 2011, the Government Commission on High Technologies and Innovations approved the List of technological platforms ( <a href="http://mrgr.org/tp/">protocol</a> No. 2), which also included NPP.  At about the same time, the concern "Sirius", part of the group "Russian Technologies", was appointed coordinator of work on the creation of a national software platform.  From this point on, market participants began to get the feeling that instead of competition, ‚ÄúSirius‚Äù had chosen the tactics of squeezing other companies from the market. <br><br>  Therefore, when the conditions of the competition for the creation of a prototype of the NPP were published, the document caused a lot of questions from the representatives of the open source software community, united in the Association of RASPO.  Questions were formulated in <a href="http://www.raspo.ru/content/21.html">letters</a> to the Ministry of Communications and Mass Media, FAS and S..  Naryshkin, as Chairman of the Presidium of the Council for the Development of the Information Society under the President of the Russian Federation.  Why at these addresses?  Because the Ministry of Communications and Mass Media is the customer, the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe NPP is described in the Information Society program, the FAS is because the conditions of the competition, in the opinion of the DRAs, did not comply with current legislation and could lead to restriction of competition.  By the way, there were 9 claims! <br><br>  What is the reason for the officials ignoring the appeals of market participants, we can only guess.  As one of the managers of Alt Linux <a href="http://mashckoff.livejournal.com/215211.html">reported</a> in a live journal, ‚Äúconditions are far from taking into account only our proposals, although ours are taken as a basis.  And I think the main potential participants knew our proposals before the contest. ‚Äù  These are the words of Alexey Novodvorsky.  So  it can be assumed that when the conditions of the competition were written, only one point of view on the creation of the GMP was heard.  And once at the time of the preparation of the documentation, Alt Linux was part of the DRAs, it was likely that the officials considered that the formalities were observed and consultations with the expert community were held. <br><br>  However, a fairly large group of participants in the free software market has a different point of view on the GMP, which is quite different from the one presented in the tender documentation.  So  Claims to the conditions - this is a discussion about the development of the open source software market in our country for the near future.  And discussion participants advocate 2 opposing views: <br>  1. Raspo.  GMP is a set of open standards.  Everything that meets these standards has the right to exist. <br>  2. "Alt Linux".  GMP is a reference system.  We will determine the standard and decide who to take in the SPE, and whom to leave behind. <br><br>  To the fact that the competition was supposed to win Alt Linux, the market began to prepare for a long time.  And at the highest level.  For example, what <a href="http://www.dni.ru/tech/2010/9/13/198875.html">did</a> he <a href="http://www.dni.ru/tech/2010/9/13/198875.html">say</a> in 2010 in an interview with President DA?  Medvedev Mr. Chemezov (Russian Technologies Concern): ‚ÄúThe IT-holding Sirius, specially created for this, will work on creating the Russian operating system.‚Äù ‚ÄúOn the basis of this enterprise, we are creating our modern national software platform.  This is a Linux platform, but with our specifics. ‚Äù  As <a href="http://www.computerra.ru/vision/605576/">written</a> in the media for this purpose, "Sirius" specifically bought part of the company "Alt Linux". <br><br>  So, describing the situation on the eve of submitting applications for the competition, it was possible to fix the following positions: <br>  - The parties radically disagree on the functions of the GMP. <br>  - The tender documentation takes into account the position of only one of the parties. <br>  - The winner of the competition is known in advance. <br>  - Officials ignore the opinion of most market participants. <br><br>  Therefore, the members of the raspo decided to take part in the competition on deliberately non-profit conditions, in order to prevent the victory of the participant who initiated the wording of the requirements specification, from our point of view.  At the same time inside, the RASPO teams have reached a clear agreement that the winner will ensure such a result that any manufacturer of software products that meet the developed set of standards and regulations will be able to participate in any supply, and these products will be included in the foundation of algorithms and programs SPE. <br><br>  Although, if you approach the work on the creation of the NPP systemically, then it would be correct <br>  divide this competition into 2 independent projects: research (the result of which would be the concept, principles, TK), discuss the results of research with the public, and only then do the ROC (on the implementation of the concept and TK).  These principles were protected by the RASPO in all their letters and appeals, but did not achieve success. <br><br>  To guarantee the security of these principles, the DRAs entered into this competition.  This is an excellent example of the self-organization of the community for the sake of higher goals, and not for the sake of short-term earnings or lobbying its own system.  And it deserves great respect: reputation is at stake <br>  the company that ventured to lead this project - Penguin Software. <br><br>  PS <br>  In the next topic, I will focus in more detail on bids and talk about what needs to be done in 16 days of work on the project. <habracut></habracut></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/129940/">https://habr.com/ru/post/129940/</a></p>
