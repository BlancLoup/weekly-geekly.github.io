About how the best of the available services caused love, respect, admiration and pleasure </h1><br>  Having been in the field of 1s-franchising for many years in a row, the author of these lines earned not only heavy projects for many people automatization of trading, accounting, finance, production, but also in very easy meetings for installing / updating platforms and configuration releases. <br><br>  Of course, it was not always with them that there were fresh releases and platforms - all day long for customers, sometimes you only manage to get to the office what money and documents to come.

      And when the Yota miracle first appeared in the form of an Egg egg with a wi-fi access point on board, it was immediately acquired and tested, as well as put into operation in combat order. <br><br>  When this device was replaced with new LTE technology, the first aesthetic properties and battery reliability were lost.  The new box was unsightly and quickly discharged, but the main function is even better. <br><br>  Being one of the first users of the iota, it was possible to get the Internet for a year (first for one, then for the other) at a low price for unlimited, more than competitive in the market. <br><br>  But the desired coverage was not everywhere, although with the integration with the megaphone there were hopes that further - everywhere! <br>  Love grew and grew stronger, and when the iota offered to buy a SIM card, even despite the fact that my 4s does not support LTE - it was decided - I take it!  And after all, there has been a lot of joy from the execution of this decision! <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h1>  Part 2 (lyric).  About how two love getting along in a person can lead to happiness, but become invisible cause of embarrassment, frustration and pain </h1><br>  Years go by, health goes away, illnesses come.  It so happens that for many months something hurts and no reason is found.  It happened to me.  And it is necessary for this to happen that an old friend, a doctor in the past, but now a co-owner of a small clinic, helped to find the root of all ills, simply suggesting the reason for a random examination.  And the meeting was still connected with 1C, despite the fact that this was a friendly help me, as a person who has not been practicing innovation work for a long time.  Just met two people to help one to disassemble the accumulated problems in 1C accounting, and at the same time helped the other to disassemble the accumulated problems with health. <br><br>  Therefore, as you understand, when this friend called again, after a quarter, asking for help - could I refuse her? <br><br><h1>  Part 3 (Heiter)  The main story about how in 5 hours, 500 megabytes and word for word love turns into hate </h1><br><br>  So, 14 hours and 40 minutes, I throw 200 rubles into the personal account of my mobile Yota, so that on the balance sheet after deducting the commission there is the desired 150 to pay for 24 hours of unlimited Internet. <br><br>  Yes, yes, I remember that the torrents promise to cut in speed, but I used it for many years and nothing foretold trouble. <br><br>  50 minutes I suffer in order to somehow connect the wonderful paid option, but the tech support helps me right in the chat, and gives me a list of two USSD commands.  Hooray! <br><br>  I connect the option, I run the speed test first on the smartphone - normally, more than 2 Mbps <br><br>  I still do not know how much I need to download (who knows, for a quarter, several dozen new configuration releases can come out for 1C). <br><br>  There are of course no ITS disks with you - but this has not been disturbing for a long time, since 1C has established support via the Internet.  I reproach my girlfriend a little for not buying at least some kind of Internet to my workplace in order to update directly from 1C and start downloading the necessary platform from the corporate server.  196 megabytes.  15 megabytes per minute means 15 minutes of waiting. <br><br>  But after a few seconds a break occurs.  Another attempt.  Still.  Cliff after cliff - how is that?  No more than 3-4 megabytes are downloaded and that's it.  At the same time, I find that access to all sites is blocked at all.  Even from a smartphone.  DNS error! <br><br>  What to do?  I recall a download manager from the ancient past of modem connections.  From several attempts I download miserable 2.5 megabytes.  Hooray!  Now the attempts will not be wasted! <br><br>  Every 5-8 seconds, falling off, with pauses from 3 to 30 seconds, I pump out the platform, then the last release, find out that I need an intermediate one, pump it out again, then another and - offensively, but only one minor version is not enough ... And more - one . <br><br>  On this latest release already in the hearts through the chat, which hangs and crashes, I start to troll tech support yota <br><br>  19:20 - everything is downloaded, I start the installation, in the meantime I continue to fight with tech support.  Modem mode is already turned off, but there is no Internet in the smartphone.  I get pieces of sites of 5-10 kilobytes and silence. <br><br>  I swear with technical support already furiously. <br><br>  22:40 - updates are finally installed (who knows, this is a slow process, considering that there is only 1GB of RAM on the target computer) <br><br>  23:20 - I have time to return home.  It has changed either 3, or 4 operators in the chat.  Internet in the smartphone is still there.  Technical support claims that I still have Tettering enabled (I quickly learn from home Internet that I‚Äôm starting to understand how a word technically works, I find that people use workarounds and don‚Äôt pay, but you need root-access to the smartphone and a special application - no, this is not for me ...) <br><br>  23:40 - Internet returned to the smartphone.  There were spoons, but the sediment remained ... <br><br>  It would seem, so what?  The company has secured itself by agreement, albeit unobvious, but formally true. <br><br>  But not everywhere there is coverage yota and sometimes I have to use the mobile Internet from other operators.  For example, parents in the village, for a comparable amount of money per month, from a widespread operator, mining a self-made spiral antenna 3G from behind the lake (about 10 km), for months we get confident traffic from 0.5 to 2.5 Mb / s, without much grief ( well, only adjusted for weather conditions), if necessary, receiving 10 Gigabytes per day (and even, to be honest, in torrents, which are not good at cutting, but could). <br><br>  What were my expectations from yota after 5 years of life? <br>  It is obvious that it is illegal and unreasonably overpriced ... <br><br>  Please don't let your expectations be exaggerated. <br>  In fairness, it should be said that I was completely satisfied with the Internet on a smartphone from iota.  Although I will not say that changing the sim card from red and white to white and blue, I felt some special effect.  Approximately the same traffic, for about the same money. <br><br>  Just plus love.  Now everything is the same, but love with a minus sign.  And a stupid question: am I crying to that? <br><br><h1>  P.S </h1><br>  You have probably already been taught that the market is a woman, and the seller is a man.  Clients have a female consumer psychology.  And this is best expressed by the example of one of the many alternative myths about the creation of man. <br><br>  One day, God created a woman.  She was beautiful and delightful, so God created the Garden of Eden for her and settled her in it. <br>  And the woman was happy.  Three days. <br><br>  After which she prayed - Lord, it is so beautiful here, but I am here all alone!  You haven't been with me for so long, please make some creature that was next to me and protect me when I'm scared. <br><br>  Then God created the tiger.  The tiger was strong and reliable.  He did not move a single step away from the woman and protected her sleep, and during the day he could step aside and doze, taking care that nothing disturbed the woman‚Äôs peace.  And the woman was happy.  Three days. <br><br>  Then she prayed - Lord, this tiger is very strong and reliable, but it is so strict and stern!  I have absolutely no one to play with!  Create some creature that would entertain me when I'm bored. <br><br>  Then God created a monkey.  The monkey jumped, played, built hilarious faces.  And the woman was happy.  Three days. <br><br>  Then she prayed - Lord, this monkey is so funny, but very stupid.  I myself am slowly becoming stupid with her!  Create some creature that would teach me wisdom and maturity. <br><br>  And God made the serpent.  The snake was thinking all the time, her eyes shone with wisdom, and her movements were full of complacency and tolerance.  And the woman was happy.  Three days. <br><br>  Then she prayed - Lord, this snake is very wise, she teaches me patience and peace, but she always says nothing!  Only from you I can hear a few words, but it happens so rarely!  Create a creature that could talk to me! <br><br>  And then God created the parrot.  The parrot taught new words and his speech became more and more saturated.  And the woman was happy.  Three days.  Then she scratched and chased the tiger, beat the monkey, tied a snake into a knot, plucked the feathers from the parrot's tail and prayed - Lord, please create a creature that can bear everything from me! <br><br>  And then God created man. <br><br>  May God grant you patience to overcome all the vagaries of your customers! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/291726/">https://habr.com/ru/post/291726/</a></p>
