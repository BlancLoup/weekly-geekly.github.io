Perhaps it is even possible to put the word ‚Äúobligatory‚Äù at the beginning of the previous sentence.  Because more than half of clients and partners will not have business with you if you do not have a line beginning with the cherished www.  Moreover - the second half will fall off if your site does not appear in all sorts of maps and collections, but if you are interested in reading about the creation of your first business site, it‚Äôs too early to talk about maps and collections.  We begin, as they say, ab ovo. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/7c6/d03/38e/7c6d0338e09c4589a0ea863c4f4e83d0.png"><a name="habracut"></a><br>  (Picture to attract attention, but it displays the main essence) <br>  At the very beginning of my business start, I postponed the creation of the site, since the one that could satisfy my own ambitions did not fit into the budget, and the simple economy option did not match the company's ambitions.  I mean, ‚Äúfor Athos this is too much, but for the Count de La F√®re ‚Äî too little.‚Äù <br><br>  In addition, to create a full-fledged site, when everything that I am ready to tell people, until it fits in a group on Facebook, is somehow ... overkill or something.

      I saw the exit simple and elegant - a business card site, that is, the most concise landing page.  For a beginner startup is a great option.  A good way to show yourself, to form the desired image and start from afar to approach the beast called the CEO.  The main thing is that your website will dot the i's right away and, at the subconscious level, will explain to customers and partners who you are and what you have to say. <br><br>  So, where and to whom to run. <br><br>  The option in which you yourself or your colleague / friend / debtor understand the creation of sites, we immediately discard as obvious.  <b>Point A is point B</b> , everything is clear. <br><br>  <b>Creative agencies</b> .  Good, but expensive.  Personally, this option hasn‚Äôt come up to me either, for the reason that in 90% of cases a manager or designer requires a TK.  And I, however strange it may sound, did not even know what should be on my business card.  And do not say, they say, fu, as it is, to begin with a not-understand-what, tyzhbusinessmen.  According to statistics, more than half of startups DO NOT represent what should be on their website.  The most customer-oriented agencies offer to fill out a questionnaire with wishes.  I first sat down to fill out, and then I was depressed - all sorts of wishes and sentences took up 10 pages in 10 points, and I had enough for the first three questions.  Name, domain name and hosting.  I am sure that there are agencies in the world (and even in Russia) that can say ‚Äúwe see everything ourselves, this is how it will arise,‚Äù and this will be the very thing that my ego wanted.  But in general, such miracles are not fair to demand from agencies. <br><br>  <b>Ready templates</b> .  Cheap.  Cheap here is the key word - all this mess will look exactly as much as you spend on it.  Do you want to look like Uncle Vanya from the provinces in a suit that is not the size - please.  In all other cases - better than nothing.  With these sites the Internet is flooded with a little less than completely, and there is neither soul nor raisin in them. <br><br>  <b>Search for a like-minded freelancer on social networks and forums</b> .  Way, frankly, dreary.  In addition, there is a risk - with the freelancer you are not connected with documents, he is an independent person.  It may disappear, because 3G has ended in Bali.  Or one project can be done ideally, and in another one it can be done with templates.  But: free birds are much more willing to agree on non-standard terms of agreement than agencies.  At the same time, freelancers usually require adequate remuneration (although, if the freelancer completely lowers the bar, it‚Äôs better to refuse, most likely it will be a cheese in a mousetrap).  And the bonus is the probability that you can find a qualified employee in your future company, here is the highest. <br><br>  I think you already guessed that the third option was perfect for me.  I immediately wrote to the freelancer that I do not know how to write TK, but told me what feelings my project causes me and what feelings it should cause among clients.  And he understood me!  Everything worked out in a short time and with prompt responses to my comments in WhatsApp. <br><br>  Finally, I will say one thing.  <b>The site should not like so much you and the designer, as your target audience</b> .  I know, it is sometimes impossible to understand what the public wants.  So let this credo simply serve as a kind of, so to speak, border of your imagination.  Please do not sculpt rainbow butterflies everywhere, even if you are an entomologist. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/286942/">https://habr.com/ru/post/286942/</a></p>
