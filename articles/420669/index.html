Informatization and computerization today affect all spheres of human life, including real estate.  Smart home - technology for housing automation, has long been developing around the world. <br><br><h2>  Smart homes - volume and market dynamics </h2><br>  According to the research of the analytic agency Strategy Analytics, dedicated to the smart home market, the global expenditures for the corresponding equipment, systems and services in 2017 reached $ 84 billion, an increase of 16% compared to 2016, when sales were measured at $ 72 billion. <br><br>  By the end of 2017, the number of households using smart home solutions worldwide was 164 million, compared with 136 million a year earlier. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Currently, just under 10% of households in the US and just under 3% of households in Europe have smart home systems installed, the number of which should double or triple over the next few years.

      In Russia, the automation market is also gaining momentum - products and technologies are emerging almost as fast as in Europe and the USA. <br><br>  The Russian market of smart home systems in 2012 was estimated at about 4 billion rubles by the IAA "Rustelecom", and by 2016 the volume had more than doubled and amounted to more than 10 billion rubles. <br><br>  The market of smart homes is developing and increasing its volume every year.  But the sphere of automation is now moving in the direction of a much larger scale and suggests a broader functionality than installing sensors in an apartment. <br><br>  The market is a relatively new and promising IT platform.  Our company has already implemented a project in the development of a mobile application for the residential complex, and our customers continue to show interest in this area, so we decided to analyze the automation systems in the real estate market and utilities.  A sample of our research includes solutions in one way or another connected with the automation of real estate and the activities of the management company - from projects "Smart House" for individuals to complex software and hardware solutions covering the activities of housing and public utilities and management companies.  In total, 40 products with 31 parameters were analyzed, including the software and hardware functions of the systems. <br><br>  In the first part of the review, we will look at the structure of the Russian automation market according to various criteria and give a general description of the solutions. <br><br><h2>  Real Estate Automation Market in Russia </h2><br>  At the moment, the market is filled with a variety of solutions that can be ranked by the following levels of automation: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/cac/43a/714/cac43a714107ee8609dcba851bb834ca.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Let's take a closer look at each level of automation: <br><br><ul><li>  Individual - automation at this level involves a simple mobile application for a resident with the functions of payment for utility services, informing about events, news of housing and communal services, communication and voting of residents, etc. </li><li>  Apartment - installation of sensors, controllers inside the apartment with the ability to run automatic scenarios in the room, security control inside the apartment.  - automated accounting and document management for the Criminal Code. </li><li>  Management Companies (MC) - Software solutions to simplify / improve the activities of the MC, interact with residents, information disclosure, etc. </li><li>  Home - the introduction of engineering automation in the structure of the house - scheduling, installation of sensors, actuators, controllers at the house level, ACS elements.  Equipment enabling remote monitoring of systems at home and promptly responding to emergency situations. </li><li>  Residential complex (LCD) - includes 2 previous levels of automation.  It assumes the availability of tools for management and monitoring of all houses in the residential complex for the Criminal Code, accounting, document management.  Integrated software and hardware solution. </li></ul><br>  The market structure by level of automation is presented in the diagram: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/9e6/f01/ef5/9e6f01ef587ccff62063faf9e18ddabe.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  As you can see, most of the solutions automate an apartment / house, or CM processes.  Such a distribution by level of automation is logical, because the main problems that are solved by automation are the simplification of business processes occurring during house management (CC activities), as well as ensuring savings in energy consumption and increasing safety and comfort of living (in an apartment / house). <br><br>  It should be noted that the niche of full automation at all levels from physical.  persons before the residential complex, in which there are controls of the ‚ÄúSmart Home‚Äù systems, as well as tools to simplify the management system‚Äôs activities, are represented only by one product. <br><br>  Let us single out the segments of consumers for whom the products are aimed at the real estate automation market.  The main groups are physical.  The person managing the company is building.  Consider each group in more detail. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/9ef/e74/c98/9efe74c98d5dd0bd4f0bd6fa72208f9f.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The structure of the automation market by target consumer groups is presented in the histogram: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/43d/129/1d9/43d1291d979392fec5502600ff1a4348.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Most of the decisions are directed to management companies.  Similar solutions are presented by various software products from services to the complete automation of CM processes. <br><br>  Significant market share - household automation, aimed at physical.  Individuals are presented as budget solutions in the form of equipment sets for an apartment that the user can install and configure independently, as well as premium solutions that automate the control of ventilation, heating, lighting, electrical appliances and home security.  This market segment is widespread in the world and in Russia. <br><br>  Also, the automation market can be segmented by type of solutions: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c75/655/c61/c75655c61f317ce4aa4b8148bd4f880d.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The structure of the market by type of decision is presented on the histogram: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/81c/a3a/9af/81ca3a9af7c8cb1531b90f0fcbbac85e.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Most of the solutions are smart homes for automating the private ownership of specific individuals.  The remaining decisions are aimed at automating and simplifying the activities of the management company, increasing the prestige of real estate with the developer. <br><br>  Integrated automation, which involves software and hardware management of housing for owners and tools for the management company is located on the 3rd place. <br><br>  The real estate automation market in Russia is multifaceted and represented by various types of solutions.  The largest market segment is the automation of individual residential areas and the activities of the management company.  Wellsoft also has its own project in this segment of automation and is currently developing an application for the automation of housing and public utilities. <br><br>  The largest part of automation products is aimed at individuals and management companies.  Such solutions are relatively simple and often do not involve complex software and hardware automation. <br><br>  In the next part of the review, we will examine in more detail the functionality of modern automation solutions and compare them according to various criteria. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/420669/">https://habr.com/ru/post/420669/</a></p>
