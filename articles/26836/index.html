      Olaf said that this is a myth, but he gave a list of the most advanced antiques on such things.  Grach argued that the artifact of such a capacity could not help but leave traces and pass through the hands unnoticed, but he sketched an approximate functional diagram and the composition of the components from which a digital book with a similar set of features could consist.  Net4er turned out to be more specific, but his words sounded like a sentence. <br><br>  ‚ÄúIn order to accommodate such a volume of information, the existing high-capacity carriers will suffice.  Login to the network is not needed.  But what I heard suggests that this thing can change mass without additional transforming and energy modules, and this already smacks of violating the laws of physics and other alchemy.  Or‚Ä¶ " <br>  "Or?" <br>  ‚ÄúThe artifact has a direct connection with the Basis.  The one who made it, probably, knows much more than usual network bikes about "noospheric breakthroughs" and "avalanche-like traffic". <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  ¬ªOpening the massive cover you see the four headings directories - thematic, chronological, author and language.  By selecting one of them, you go to the next page and then everything, in general, resembles working with a media version of some complete works in a pocket e-book format.  Find the right author and the text and all the remaining several hundred pages of thin "electronic paper" filled with the text of the selected book.  Of course, you will be able to switch to the hiertext mode and read the dictionary, go to the critical articles and essays written about this book.  In the case of text adaptation, you can trigger a movie or visualize individual episodes. <br><br>  Yes, you tell me, all this is already there and anyone can buy the collected works of Leo Tolstoy or Tolkien in all available languages ‚Äã‚Äãthat fit in one pocket. <br><br>  But Metabiblion is different from other books of this kind.  It is available not only the text of the book.  It can reproduce not only the content, but also the form.  Would you like to read "Gargantua and Pantagruel" in the form in which it was published during the life of Rabelais?  No problems.  The book will become what it was published eleven centuries ago.  Would you like to get acquainted with the first book printed on the first Guttenberg machine?  You are welcome.  Do you use Metabiblion in the afternoon, as a thick reference book, on your way home do you want to look through the last detective of some currently popular writer?  A couple of finger presses in the right place and please read on health ... " <br><br>  Net4er said that collecting data on all editions of a book is a difficult task, but with serious investments it is not so long-term.  Reproduction of the texture of old paper media is also possible.  The latest models of ‚Äúe-paper‚Äù on thermo threads allow changing the texture of the carrier.  But Pocket Beech and Ulysses are different masses in the first place.  It is impossible to rebuild a book without nanoinstallations and mass generators, and such equipment cannot be carried away in your pocket, and you need more energy for such an operation than for simply displaying electronic text. <br><br>  But Tensing said that he held her in his hands and in his eyes she made three transformations.  In the last conversation, Aztec mentioned one of eleven copies of Metablibion, stored in the ‚Äúhard‚Äù archives of GK.  In the end, there is an officially registered transaction for two and a half million euros for the purchase of the e-book ‚ÄúMetabiblion‚Äù at the Sotheby‚Äôs auction. <br><br>  Of course, by some anonymous ... </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/26836/">https://habr.com/ru/post/26836/</a></p>
