      Since this post is opening with us, I want to dedicate it to history.  The stories of one person, about which, probably, few of you <s>know,</s> remember, but 14 years ago, millions knew him. <br>  If you know the inscription on the picture, then you understand who will be discussed;) <br><br><h3>  So whom (or what?) Did man create? </h3><br>  <a href="http://www.links.net/vita/web/start/markoff.html"><strong>"A Better Way to Browse"</strong></a> - this article was inspired by the 20-year-old <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justin_Hall">Justin Hall</a> to start learning HTML and <strong>create your own webpage on the Internet</strong> . <br>  In his diary, already later, he writes: <br><blockquote>  <em>In January 1994, I read some HTML information online, installed a copy of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacHTTP">MacHTTP</a> on my <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Powerbook_180">Powerbook 180</a> , and marked my first page <a href="http://www.links.net/vita/web/start/original.html"><strong>, Justin's Home Page</strong></a> .</em>  <em>The first entry contained several links to HTML information, some notes about my college, a <a href="">photo with me and Oliver North (Oliver North)</a> , a clip where the lead singer of <a href="http://www.links.net/dox/muzik/rok/janes/">Jane's Addiction</a> says “I am also on acid, but I will not throw shoes at you” and list of my favorite websites.</em> <em><br><br></em>  <em>Our Swarthmore College was disconnected to the network;</em>  <em>Every time when my computer was hanging or rebooting, I had to run around all the hostels and ask everyone to restart their systems so that everything worked correctly.</em> <em><br><br></em>  <em>The first entry on my page outside college was January 23, 1994.</em> </blockquote><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/bbb/ee2/c74/bbbee2c743b4ae8903617540b146abec.gif" width="382" height="253" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="left">  The number of visitors to the page grew very quickly.  But the computer network of the college did not withstand such a burden, and Justin was forced to look for another solution. <br>  Turning to a specialty store (WiReD), he immediately managed to get everything needed to continue working on his diary: <br><blockquote>  <em>... She asked me for my e-mail, then I gave her a link to my site.</em>  <em>When I saw the photo of Cary Grant’s acid taker she laughed and I joined her</em> </blockquote><br><br>  By August 1994, all the pages of Justin were transferred to the office equipment of the store itself, which was later renamed HotWired.  Justin himself was hired as a junior editor of the department responsible for publishing on the web. <br><blockquote>  <em>I had the opportunity to speak to the audience and talk about my work experience, and I noticed that everyone supported my point of view.</em>  <em>Web technologies do not use their full potential.</em>  <em>There are so many opportunities for people to take a broader look at this world.</em>  <em>Take a look around you all can contribute too.</em>  <em>Take someone who knows an interesting story and invite him to share it with everyone on the web.</em>  <em>Such stories that millions can read are a great opportunity to make the Internet and web technologies the most used.</em> </blockquote><br>  And he was really right, I think it’s not even worth explaining why :) <br>  But all the same, more than one year passed, before the users began to actively join this sphere.  The term <strong>“blog” itself</strong> appeared only 5 years later, in 1999, when Peter Merholz (Peter Merholz), the creator of the Peterme blog, decomposed the weblog term into two parts - “we blog” (“we keep a diary”).  On the basis of the word blog a new verb was also formed - “to blog”, meaning “to perform actions aimed at keeping an Internet diary”.  And in August of the same year, the company Pyra Labs, based in San Francisco, created the <strong>Blogger</strong> portal.  It was the first free, open source and extremely easy to use tool that gave impetus to the creation of the blogosphere. <br><br>  As Justin admits in her diary: <br><blockquote>  <em>I created all this on my Powerbook.</em>  <em>And it cost me nothing.</em>  <em>I can keep a diary from anywhere, from anywhere in the world.</em>  <em>And maybe it's for the better, or for the worse, but no one can control, edit what I'm writing.</em>  <em>This is a dream.</em> </blockquote><br>  Now he also continues to keep his records, but now in a new modern format: <a href="http://www.gamelayers.com/">GameLayers</a> , <a href="http://pmog.com/">PMog</a> . <br><br>  PS I hope that my efforts to collect and translate information were not in vain and this record was interesting for you.  Create, write, publish!  :) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/287482/">https://habr.com/ru/post/287482/</a></p>
