It‚Äôs not so interesting to talk about the characteristics and usage scenarios, all platforms do one or the other. <br><br>  What is really interesting is the insanely cool animation orchestration done on color e-ink.  First, the approach itself with a smooth transformation of the elements, when all actions in the interface look like one big and coherent animation.  Similar design works with material design and this is a new level of complexity for designers.  The Android loader, what <a href="https://dribbble.com/johnschlemmer">John Schlemmer</a> is doing - this is a guide for the near future.  This is not a cheap cheat with springs that make the film Michael Bay from the interface - <a href="https://www.facebook.com/jvetrau/posts/10152787516208250">half of Dribbble is now given to these handicrafts</a> . <br><br>  Secondly, the fact that this is possible on electronic paper, which is not very much favored by top manufacturers.  The first Pebble had ridiculous delays, but the new model gives out 30 FPS - everything looks very, very smooth and effective.  And at the same time keeps the battery for a week, and does not die by the beginning of the next day.  They say the third YotaPhone will also use color e-ink.  If they get something similar, we are in for the heyday of this suddenly cool design technology. <br><br>  <strong><a href="https://econsultancy.com/blog/66058-fashion-ecommerce-are-virtual-fitting-rooms-the-silver-bullet/">Fashion ecommerce - Are virtual fitting rooms the silver bullet?</a></strong> <br>  Article on the use of virtual fitting rooms for online sale of clothing.
