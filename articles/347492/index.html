  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How to bargain about wages in the United States. American Conversation Etiquette</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Nothing raises the salary in the offer, as the counteroffer.  And here it would be possible to end the conversation, but not in the USA.  Whether you have a counteroffer or not, in America it is very important to observe some etiquette of wage bargaining.  It is unlikely that the conversation with your potential employer will go further if you arrive and put your offer with the words "Can you block?". <br>  How to negotiate in an American way and what small tricks will help to achieve the necessary figures even without a counter-affer, read further in the article. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h2>  Right time </h2><br>  For negotiations it is very important to choose the right time.  If you start talking about money very early, it can be perceived as arrogance and selfishness. <br><br>  As a rule, Eychary themselves ask about the salary expectations of the candidate in a telephone interview, and if the company cannot materialize them, then the matter will not go further than this telephone conversation.  However, before you assign a phone call, do a search for this company on payroll sites.

      Anna Runyan, founder of <a href="http://www.classycareergirl.com/">Classy Career Girl</a> , explains: ‚ÄúYou shouldn't get the impression that salary is all you care about.  Do not ask a question about money first, wait until the employer sends you an offer. ‚Äù  This is a basic rule.  Nothing will make your bargaining position stronger than the position of the only candidate offered by the offer. <br><br>  Of course, they probably have a fallback, but they still want to get you more than the second candidate, and much more than all the other candidates that they had.  You have no such lever of pressure during interviews. <br><br><h3>  When it's too late </h3><br>  You cannot get your words back after you have signed an offer.  Even if you suddenly realize that your salary is not enough to pay off all the bills, your chances of changing something are almost nil, and trying to replay everything is likely to ruin your reputation in the new company.  That is why it is important to take a day or two to get acquainted with the conditions offered in the offer. <br><br><h2>  Correct thinking </h2><br>  Firstly, it is very important not to take an offer as a sentence or a point in the interview process.  The offer is a draft, and companies expect you to start making your own changes to it.  Do not let the fear of discussing money or the fear of uncomfortable situations deprive you of what you deserve.  In addition, the offer has a snowball effect: further salary increases will depend on the numbers you accept at the very beginning. <br><br>  Secondly, negotiations are not ‚ÄúI am against them,‚Äù it is ‚Äúwe are looking for a compromise.‚Äù  You need to remember how you go to a recruiter or hiring manager.  Smile and always be pleasant and polite, even if the discussion does not meet you.  Where possible, use phrases like "I understand" or "I see where you came from."  The way you say it, must show that you sympathize with the employer and understand what variations they have.  Do not underestimate the personal factor. <br><br><h2>  Start with the good news. </h2><br>  You have 2 news: good and a little less good.  So start just with the good!  Tell your employer that you are happy to get an offer from them, and you can‚Äôt wait to see when you can get to work.  And when you have created a pleasant tone of your conversation, you can go to a little less pleasant.  ‚ÄúIn order for me to sign a contract and start contributing to the company, I would like to discuss some points of the offer,‚Äù - so you can start a discussion of the proposed basic salary.  Salary complaints from the very beginning demonstrate neglect of the opportunity they have given you. <br><br><h2>  The range is better than reality </h2><br>  Starting negotiations on your basic compensation, even if you have a specific figure in your head, do not call it to your employer, name the percentage range by which you want to increase the proposed salary.  This will give the employer the illusion of control and room for maneuver. <br><br>  If you move to a similar position, then take the lower limit of the range 5%.  Increase the lower limit of the range to 8-10% higher if you go up. <br>  Of course, the above strategy assumes that the salary indicated in the offer is comparable to the market payment of your work. <br><br><h2>  Within a reasonable </h2><br>  The range that you call should be within reason.  In order to find out these very limits, there is a huge amount of payroll databases: <a href="http://www.glassdoor.com/index.htm">Glassdoor</a> , <a href="http://www.indeed.com/">Indeed</a> , <a href="https://www.payscale.com/">PayScale</a> and others.  You should pay attention not only to the position, experience and location, but to understand exactly how much your potential employer is willing to pay.  If you got an offer from a startup, then it‚Äôs pointless to try to bring the base salary closer to the numbers that you saw on Glassdor.com from Apple programmers.  Bargain from startups for company stocks. <br><br>  Lisa Rangel, founder of <a href="http://chameleonresumes.com/">Chameleon Resumes,</a> explains: ‚ÄúApplicants must accept a certain level of reality when negotiating salaries.  There is a big difference between requests for 10% and for requesting additional zeros. ‚Äù <br><br>  Take into account the experience and area of ‚Äã‚Äãyour knowledge.  Workers for saturated industries will have less leverage during negotiations than those with scarce knowledge. <br><br><h2>  And what in return? </h2><br>  Everyone wants to know why they are overpaying, so always explain why you want to get a higher salary and what benefits the company will receive in exchange for an increase in the salary offered.  A little unobtrusive self-promotion does not hurt. <br><br><h2>  Do not fill the pause </h2><br>  Silence for many people is uncomfortable, especially during negotiations.  But what you consider uncomfortable pauses are natural breaks in the process of communication.  This is the time when the other party digests what you just said, or is in the process of formulating an answer. <br><br>  Calm down and wait for the personnel manager to talk after you have said your phrase.  Trying to fill the silence, you look uncertain.  The desire to avoid awkward silence can lead you to say something extra. <br><br>  Now you can negotiate other benefits, such as more vacation time or early pay raises.
