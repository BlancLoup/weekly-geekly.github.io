  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Buying a brand on the conveyor</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Relatively recently, skipped the <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/129503/">post</a> about Slateat - cybersquatters in a pleasant rustling packaging.  Do not think anything bad, the service is useful for burning ideas.  When you have a beautiful system of making money in the IT sphere, you want to quickly call it a startup, find money, fly up and spread your wings.  However, as each of us knows, the most delicious part - to dream and plan, always rests on the further painstaking work on all the little things of the new project.  Often, it's an office, hiring employees, buying / making a good board, preparing legal stuff, and so on.  Including branding. <br><br>  Among all this routine is the process of finding a name for your startup, a free domain and further development of a support site, a logo, etc.  not the quickest procedure.  And if you have a lot of really important things ahead, then you should not fool around and go to the brand seller, choose something suitable, and continue your winning movement at an accelerated pace. <br><br>  I offer a small review of several noteworthy services to save the creative start of the young start-up: <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  Stilate </h2><br>  <a href="http://stylate.com/">stylate.com</a> <br>  In the discussion of the news about this service, the phrases were heard: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs cool to be invented‚Äù, ‚ÄúShould take off‚Äù, from which it is clear that they were the first to be noticed.  Very cheap, to the site apply the epithet "angry".  There is filtering by tags.  Over the past six months, I have noticed more than a dozen domain-logo pairs missing.  So the process is moving.  Payment is made through Google checkout. <br>  <b>Of the minuses</b> : dumb logos, a small stylistic variety, domains not for all occasions. <br>  <b>Pros</b> : very cheap, $ 250.

    <h2>  Brand bullos </h2><br>  <a href="http://brandbulance.com/">brandbulance.com</a> <br>  Nice site with a decent set of ready-made brands.  The guys responded responsibly to the process: the visitor does not just see a dump of logos, but meets with a chewing up procedure, an explanation in the style of ‚Äú1-2-3-ready!‚Äù.  Logos varied, for every taste.  The names also speak.  There is a filter by tags, a price plug and an alphabetical list (for numerologists, probably).  Among the features are a lot of abstract short domains and brands for them, which will be a good choice for those who do not want to be clamped under the hard name with a binding.  Prices are already adults, rarely see three-digit numbers.  Payment through the paper, but from the design it is clear that they will still connect payment systems. <br>  Do not hesitate to show the sold position that inspires optimism. <br>  <b>Cons</b> : prices, one payment system. <br>  <b>Pros</b> : simple and clear, high quality of the finished brand <br><br><h2>  Brand bucket, brand pack </h2><br>  <a href="http://www.brandbucket.com/">www.brandbucket.com</a> <br>  It is rather a symbiosis of cybersquatters and designers.  The site contains domain owners, authors of logos and everywhere looking for buyers for every taste.  Here you can buy a ready-made brand, or just a domain or name logo.  Filter by tag, creative name selection and other joys.  Wide selection due to community work. <br>  Prices are on average slightly lower than the Brand-Balance, but still around $ 2,000.  Payment by card or bank transfer. <br>  <b>Cons</b> : weak connectivity images and titles <br>  <b>Pros</b> : a wide selection, a separate service for selecting only a name-brand, the opportunity to see other works by the same designer <br><br><h2>  Tusovka brands, brandkraud </h2><br>  <a href="http://www.brandcrowd.com/">www.brandcrowd.com</a> <br>  This resource is suitable on the other than the bucket side.  On the contrary, they have many ready-made logos and, sometimes, come across logos with domains.  Suitable for those who are more important than the brand name, and the domain zone can be found and local or exotic.  In any case, a lot of domains.  But these are cybersquatters already accustomed to everyone: a couple of positions for $ 600 and further scary figures of 10 or more tens of thousands of those same ones. <br>  <b>Cons</b> : cybersquatters, exorbitant domain prices. <br>  <b>Pros</b> : There are many good inexpensive logos and brands. <br><br><h2>  findings </h2><br>  Depending on thoroughness and prejudice, the problem of your brand can be quickly solved very cheaply, for a quarter of a thousand in Stilteit, but the corporate identity will be better refined if you have money. <br>  Qualitatively and relatively inexpensively, a complete image (like a good suit) can be bought in Brand Bouolane.  You will be carefully served, ironed out, but for now they only accept the paper.  On the other hand, from the review only they take it, so that someone will be the most profitable such a purchase. <br>  If you have time to dig in a big motley market and taste different names for a long time and thoroughly, then you should go to the last two masters. <br>  And if you have a corporate mindset and you can get used to the idea that <i>inbox.xxx</i> costs $ 45,000, then you are always welcome at the last party. <br><br>  <i>Think domain is an important business engine?</i>  <i>There is an opinion that is not as much as the service itself.</i>  <i>No more than just a comfortable beautiful door to a nice huge supermarket.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>Do you have a lovely logo in your head?</i>  <i>In my practice, usually creating the entire functionality of a website or a multimedia product takes several times less time than throwing a customer when choosing a corporate color or logo.</i>  <i>Open faster, rebranding will always be possible.</i> <br><br>  I hope this low mileage of pro-brand supermarkets will help you save your valuable time. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/145668/">https://habr.com/ru/post/145668/</a></p>
