The DL360 Gen9 is a new 1U serial computing platform in the HP ProLiant family, and in addition to the new E5-2600 v3 processors and DDR4 DL360 Gen9 memory, HP‚Äôs technological advances and the company's overall vision for converged data centers. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b29/298/9f7/b292989f7ee848e4b758493ba6e37cfa.jpg"></div><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Like the larger <a href="http://www.saronit.ru/catalog/hp-proliant-dl360-gen9">DL380 Gen9</a> platform with a 2U form factor, the DL360 increases the performance of Intel Xeon E5-2600 v3 processors.  In combination with HP SmartMemory DDR4 memory modules, the server capacity can be increased up to 768 GB, the speed up to 2 133 MHz, unlike the maximum speed of 1 866 MHz in the processors of the previous generation Gen 8 with DDR3 memory.  The new E5-2600 v3 processors have up to 18 cores and allow to increase the performance per watt by three times compared to the Gen8 ProLiant servers.  For the DL360 servers, the latest generation Smart Array Controller with 12 Gb / s speeds and PCIe accelerators are suitable.  Unlike its predecessors, the DL360 Gen9 supports graphics processors: up to two active cards of a single width up to 9.5 inches long. <br><br>  The device tested in this review uses a DL360 chassis with a 1U form factor with 8 compartments for a small form factor drive, is equipped with two Intel Xeon E5-2697 v3 2.6GHz processors, 256 GB of RAM (16 DIMM slots of 16 GB of 2Rx4 PC4 each -2133) and five solid-state SAS drives of a small form factor of 400 GB.  There is no Media Bay universal bay in the device under test, but it can optionally be used to accommodate two additional bays for a small form factor drive or optical drive and a VGA connector with front-side access.  We use a two-slot PCA FLR 10GbE SFP + type transceiver interface card for a network connection.

To support testing independence, none of our reviews are funded or managed by the manufacturer of the equipment we are testing. <br><br>  Our first results relate to the <a href="http://www.saronit.ru/catalog/hp-proliant-dl360-gen9">HP ProLiant DL360 Gen9 server</a> as standard with a RAID10 array using four installed SSDs and the fifth as a boot disk.  The second set of results relates to the performance of the FlexibleLOM PCA FLR 10GbE SFP server DL360 + network interface card connected to the all flash array to demonstrate network storage capabilities. <br><br><h3>  <b>Analysis of simulated enterprise load</b> </h3><br>  For each assessment, we previously transferred the device to a steady state with a significant load of 16 threads with 16 queues in the stream.  Then, the storage will be checked with many variations of flows and queue depths to determine the effectiveness of work with low and high loads. <br><br>  <i><b>Preliminary preparation and first checks in a stable condition:</b></i> <br><ul><li>  Throughput (total I / O operations per second (IOPS) when performing read and write) </li><li>  Average latency (average latency while reading and writing) </li><li>  Maximum delay time (maximum delay time for reading and writing) </li><li>  The standard deviation of the delay time (the standard deviation of the delay time when performing read and write) </li></ul><br><br>  <i><b>This analysis includes four profiles that are widely used in manufacturers specifications and benchmarking tests:</b></i> <br><ol><li>  4k - 100% read or 100% write </li><li>  8k - 100% read or 100% write </li><li>  8k -70% read 30% write </li><li>  128k - 100% read or 100% write </li></ol><br>  With workloads composed of 4k random operations, the ProLiant DL360 Gen9 reaches 244,058 I / O operations per second when reading and only 41,021 I / O operations per second when writing using the internal RAID10 array.  In combination with the all flash array, the DL360 10GbE is capable of withstanding 253,984 I / O operations per second when reading and 300,743IOPS I / O operations per second when writing. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/727/de4/aa0/727de4aa034c4339985b33adac1ccb46.png"></div><br><br>  The average latency of the internal RAID10 array was just 1.05 ms for reading and 6.24 ms for writing.  The average delay time of the 10GbE interface with the all flash array was 10.1 ms for reading and 0.85 ms for writing. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e18/d8b/18c/e18d8b18ce4b4ee9bb30c06a9706c094.png"></div><br><br>  The maximum <a href="http://www.saronit.ru/catalog/hp-proliant-dl360-gen9">DL360 Gen9</a> delay <a href="http://www.saronit.ru/catalog/hp-proliant-dl360-gen9">time</a> is 86.6 ms when reading and 112.3 ms when writing.  The maximum delay time of the DL360 10GbE network interface with the all flash array was 60.9 ms when reading and 28.4 ms when writing. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/208/c5e/35a/208c5e35a7004eaf957c0bd8825998e1.png"></div><br><br>  The standard deviation results indicate a large change in the latency results for 4k write operations on a RAID10 SSD, which is consistent with the results shown above. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/31e/032/b0d/31e032b0d8104d9e9e5d4baae264aa39.png"></div><br><br>  After changing the server and all flash array conditions for 8k serial data transmission, we measured throughput at a load of 16 threads and with 16 queues in the stream for 100% read and 100% write operations.  Gen9 DL360 RAID10 internal storage results were 147,178 I / O operations per second for sequential read operations and 36,786 I / O operations per second for write operations.  The 10GbE network interface with the all flash array showed 159,158 I / O operations per second for read operations and 217,183 I / O operations per second for write operations. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/7c4/192/6c6/7c41926c69e1470c9c24e889552a4dbe.png"></div><br><br>  The following results were obtained on the basis of a protocol composed of random read operations of 70% and write operations of 30% 8k with different loads of threads and queues.  No combination of threads and queues created <a href="http://www.saronit.ru/catalog/hp-proliant-dl360-gen9">any</a> unexpected difficulties for <a href="http://www.saronit.ru/catalog/hp-proliant-dl360-gen9">the DL360 Gen9 server</a> with a RAID10 array.  The throughput of a RAID10 array approaches its maximum of 75,147 I / O operations per second with 16 threads with 8 queues in the stream.  The bandwidth of the 10GbE interface to the all flash array with 16 threads and 16 queues in the stream reaches 218,801 I / O operations per second. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/5e5/535/dc0/5e5535dc061140f7a609d8d185dacdc2.png"></div><br><br>  During the first few workload cycles of 8k in the 70/30 benchmark, the 10GbE all flash array configuration kept the average delay time at a theoretical minimum of approximately 0.23 ms.  No configuration showed weak points in terms of average latency. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ff0/d26/232/ff0d2623216e48b5ab9c501d20ba07d7.png"></div><br><br>  The RAID10 array experienced several noticeable latency jumps with a large queue depth.  During the heaviest load of the 8k 70/30 network interface there was a jump in the delay time, the rest of the time the maximum delay was consistent. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b73/37e/a74/b7337ea74374440593eb4da6b39ed0ea.png"></div><br><br>  The standard deviation of the latency with comparative testing of 8k 70/30 also reflects the maximum latency in a RAID10 configuration with multiple queues.  Standard deviation results show that the RAID10 array is experiencing the most trouble with consistent latency times at maximum load. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/cfc/e9d/f85/cfce9df856e5490294075c0b41ce5cbe.png"></div><br><br>  Our final testing is based on a 128k serial transfer with 100% read operations and 100% write.  The Gen9 ProLiant DL360 RAID10 internal array is able to handle 1 678 541 Kb / s for read operations and 637 581 Kb / s for write operations.  When evaluating the additional dual network interface 10GbE Gen9 DL360, the result was 2 311 475 kB / s for read operations and 2 310 042 Kb / s for write operations. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/9ae/5e4/a4d/9ae5e4a4d3564b7e84f69af465e3811b.png"></div><br><br><h3>  <b>Conclusion</b> </h3><br>  HP ProLiant DL360 Gen9 has a development that can serve as a useful component in a converged enterprise or information center architecture along with the OneView HP platform and other company innovations in management, which makes it easy to coordinate the work of hundreds and thousands of servers.  For those with more modest goals, the DL360 Gen9 offers storage density and computing power as a flexible and efficient addition to a variety of environments.  In the DL300 family, HP embraced major technological advances, including support for the latest Intel chipset, DDR4 DRAM, 10GbE and SAS3.  In our case, the server is connected to 2.5-inch solid-state drives, although the DL360 server could be used with four 3.5-inch drives, depending on work preferences.  In general, there is nothing revolutionary in the DL300 family, but there is a reason why HP sells more servers than anyone else, because it continues to provide functionality that solves the problems of the vast majority of the market. <br><br>  In our configuration with five ‚Äúoutdated‚Äù solid-state drives based on a small logical controller in the SAS2 interface based on SanDisk Pliant, we received expectedly stable operation.  In addition to the high levels of internal storage, the availability of high-performance 10GbE interfaces means that the DL360 Gen9 can be put above high-speed storage arrays in order to carry out a large number of I / O operations with minimal latency and fewer cables.  In many cases, the load versus storage will be the most popular usage scenario.  In our testing, we connected the <a href="http://www.saronit.ru/catalog/hp-proliant-dl360-gen9">DL360 Gen9 server</a> with the all flash array based on Windows Server 2012 R2 and achieved indicators that easily outperformed the double 10GbE connection.  We applied a significant load of mixed I / O operations, with a maximum load of 218,000 random I / O operations per second 8k 70/30, as well as 2.3 Gb / s of sequential operations.  Since the internal slot FlexibleLOM coped with this, we were able to leave all additional PCIe slots free for future use. <br><br>  <a href="http://www.saronit.ru/catalog/hp-servers">The updated ProLiant Gen9 family</a> continues to be the most reliable server.  HP has taken all the new developments and applied them to the server.
