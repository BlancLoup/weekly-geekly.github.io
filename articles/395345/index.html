  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Three statements by Steve Jobs that did not stand the test of time</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  In 1859, Edwin Drake, the author of the project about oil production by drilling, his colleagues said that he was crazy.  Louis Pasteur's theory of microbes was called a ridiculous fantasy.  In 1981, Bill Gates (perhaps) said that 640 KB is enough for everyone, and IBM in 1982 decided that $ 100 million was too much for Microsoft. <br><br>  Scientists, developers, chapters and representatives of corporations are wrong.  Sometimes they say what other people want to hear.  Businessmen are trying to show that their product is the best, sometimes exposing its flaws, which people will see only with time, as advantages. <br><br>  Steve Jobs also broke his own words.  Let us recall three of his statements, which were violated by himself or after his death by Apple, and discuss other similar examples.

"It turned out that people want a keyboard ... We looked at the tablet and thought that this thing would fail."  But Jobs wanted to sell even more iPods.  And he was sure that no one would watch movies on the small screen of the player. <br><br>  Apple with Steve released the iPod with a 2.7-inch small screen with the ability to watch videos, an iPad tablet and an iPhone. <br><br>  Although in the <a href="https://geektimes.ru/post/273002/">Evolution of smartphones,</a> I wrote that smart phones with touch screens were enough to the iPhone, it was Apple that we owe to their special popularity.  The following year, after the release of the iPhone, the first Android smartphone came out - the T-Mobile G1 from HTC, and then the Samsung Galaxy. <br><br>  The tablets were before the iPad.  Interestingly, the first IBM ThinkPad-branded gadget was a tablet.  But it was Apple that made this form factor popular for the mass user.  And in 2012, even orangutans <a href="https://geektimes.ru/post/136545/">learned to</a> use some applications ‚Äî for example, playing Flick Football and drawing on Doodle Buddy.  In 2011, the share of Apple tablets in the world market was 61.5%, and for the first quarter of 2016, the iPad is 25.6%. <br><br>  By the way, a few months before the release of the iPod Jobs <a href="http://www.bit-tech.net/news/hardware/2009/04/24/apple-denies-netbook-rumours/1">called</a> MP3-players junk. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/47a/372/f03/47a372f036d64381b9e0fd5a01711585.jpg"><br><br><h4>  No one will buy big phones </h4><br>  On January 9, 2007, at the MacWorld Expo conference, Steve Jobs presented three products in one: a widescreen iPod with a touchscreen display, a revolutionary phone and a revolutionary internet surfing tool.  This gadget was the first iPhone.  He received a 3.5-inch display with a resolution of 320x480 pixels, a 2-megapixel camera and an OS X operating system redesigned for a mobile device. <br><br>  Before the start of sales of the first iPhone, The Strategy Analytics Wireless Device Labs <a href="https://geektimes.ru/post/8928/">conducted a</a> series of surveys: ‚ÄúMore than 90% of respondents gave iPhone ratings higher than their current devices, and more than 40% rated the iPhone as a device with better standard features, including playing music, viewing Internet, voice mail and phone call management.  This reflects an innovative approach to user design. ‚Äù  74 days after the device entered the market, the company sold <a href="https://geektimes.ru/post/13959/">one million iPhones</a> . <br><br>  No one will buy big phones, ‚ÄùSteve Jobs claimed in public.  It is not known whether he was cunning or was sure of these words.  He called the optimal size of 3.5 inches, noted that only such a gadget would ideally lie in your hand, and that only a device with such a diagonal can be operated with one hand. <br><br>  September 12, 2012 Jobs' covenant was broken.  The new iPhone 5 got a 4-inch screen.  Two years later, on September 9, 2014, Apple introduced the iPhone 6 with a 4.7-inch display and the iPhone 6 Plus with a 5.5-inch display.  For Android phones, such display sizes were the norm, and Apple seemed to be in the market. <br><br>  The iPhone screen was enlarged after the <a href="https://geektimes.ru/post/129839/">death of Steve Jobs</a> , an event that briefly brought together users of Apple and Microsoft products, owners of Android smartphones, and people with Linux on a computer.  All agreed on a common opinion: Jobs made history, and the industry owes him. <br><br>  But maybe Steve Jobs dreamed of a large phone, but at that time there were not enough high-quality displays and capacious batteries to ensure the perfect operation of the device of this size? <br><br><h4>  Who needs a stylus? </h4><br>  Apple Newton was one of the first pocket personal computers.  The company produced it from 1993 to 1998.  The devices worked on the ARM 610 RISC-processor, supported handwriting recognition.  The company was counting on using this gadget to ‚Äúre-invent‚Äù the personal computer.  The device cost up to $ 1,000, did not fit into a pants pocket and was not successful on the market.  To control them using the stylus. <br><br>  Upon returning to Apple in 1997, one of Jobs' first decisions was to stop the production of the <a href="https://geektimes.ru/post/80882/">Newton</a> handheld computer.  Why does a person need a stylus if he already has ten fingers? <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/698/7b8/722/6987b8722700e487ab67ed162f857fba.gif"><br>  <i>The Simpsons series "Lisa on Ice" mocked the recognition of the handwriting input Newton</i> <br><br>  ‚ÄúWho needs a stylus?‚Äù, - this phrase came from the mouth of Steve Jobs in 2007 during the presentation of the first iPhone.  A few years after the release of the <a href="https://geektimes.ru/post/132517/">Samsung Galaxy Note</a> with the stylus, Apple realized that there was a certain group of users who painted.  And that the stylus has the right to exist.  Jonathan Ive <a href="http://www.wallpaper.com/design/apple-reinvents-the-pencil-in-conversation-with-sir-jony-ive">told</a> about this: ‚ÄúWe found that there is a clear group of people who will appreciate the tool that allows you to draw in ways that you cannot do with your fingers.  And I suspect that this is not a small group of people.  I do not think it is limited to those of us who went to art school. ‚Äù  Apple has released the Pencil drawing tool that works with the iPad Pro tablet. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/c40/bff/919/c40bff91931cdf3cc696a388b9906075.jpg"><br><br><h4>  Conclusion </h4><br>  Did Steve Jobs Break His Own Promises?  Yes.  Has Apple violated the promises of its representatives or Steve Jobs?  Yes.  Does this mean that Apple is a dishonest corporation?  No! <br><br>  Many people throw words to the wind.  In such words can be laid important for a certain point in time.  A marketing ploy, an attempt to reassure users, a desire to show the company from the best side - there can be many reasons.  This is especially noticeable on the company, the head of which personifies it.  Do you remember <a href="https://geektimes.ru/post/217015/">who founded</a> Samsung?  What about Nintendo?  Many people will promptly give similar answers to questions about Apple and Microsoft thanks to their leaders, Steve Jobs and Bill Gates.  Therefore, the words of these people will always be taken much more seriously than the words of little-known company directors. <br><br>  Over time, everything changes.  Changing production capabilities.  Reduced cost of components.  Their range is increasing.  Therefore, the ‚Äúideal size of the smartphone‚Äù could initially be 4-4.7 inches, if Apple could assemble the necessary high-quality components at an affordable price.  But the maximum was 3.5 inches, and I needed an idea showing how exactly this option is better than all the other options. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/395345/">https://habr.com/ru/post/395345/</a></p>
