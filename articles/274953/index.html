  <section class="page js-page"><h1>"Bitrix24" - now completely free communications for any team</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Debugged communication within the team is half the success.  And it's not about corporate culture or social empathy.  The main task of communication is the formation of a working environment and trusting business relationships.  However, building the right relationships within a team is quite difficult, especially when it comes to companies with freelancers or a large number of branches.  For this we need special tools that will guide the interaction in the right direction, accumulate and save information, erase geographic boundaries.  As a rule, a company implements several tools for this - mail, various instant messengers, server disks and much more.  <a href="http://www.bitrix24.ru/%3Futm_source%3Dhabrhabr%26utm_medium%3Dreferral%26utm_campaign%3Dfreesn">‚ÄúBitrix24‚Äù</a> offers to do away with an incredible number of shortcuts on the desktop and move to a new level of corporate communication.  And by the way, the service is free. <br><br> <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/bitrix/blog/274953/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/273/394/88d/27339488d4d746ae9e82b26ea097d01d.png"></a> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  <font color="#0079db">"Bitrix24" for communication without borders</font> </h2><br>  Now Bitrix24 provides the company with free communications, which easily compete with popular counterparts, including a lot of shareware, and paid for corporate use.  In the new version it is more convenient than ever to work with remote, freelancers, freelancers and colleagues from branches, regardless of their geographic location. <br><br>  All communication tools are integrated into a social network for work.  It is easy to share information, discuss current projects, accumulate knowledge.  The structure of the social work network <a href="http://www.bitrix24.ru/%3Futm_source%3Dhabrhabr%26utm_medium%3Dreferral%26utm_campaign%3Dfreesn">‚ÄúBitrix24‚Äù</a> provides fast and efficient discussion, operational work, helps to manage time and remember all current tasks.

    <h3>  <b>Social network for work</b> </h3><br>  At the center of the social network is an interactive live feed, which displays all the important events, reminders and announcements relating to each of the employees.  This is a powerful information dashboard, thanks to which it is almost impossible to miss something important and urgent. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/bda/ab2/f07/bdaab2f077fb46b292f3d85ca2d8e3be.png"><br><br>  In a live feed, employees can create posts, attach files and pictures to them using drag'n'drop technology or from third-party repositories (OneDrive, Google Drive, Dropbox), and also create and edit documents directly in Bitrix24.  You can immediately configure access to the created document for the desired group of employees.  All documents are stored on Bitrix24.Disk.  This provides easy access to information, and in the case of a manager‚Äôs departure or absence, all working documentation is available to substitute colleagues.  Files and pictures can be discussed and edited right inside <a href="http://www.bitrix24.ru/%3Futm_source%3Dhabrhabr%26utm_medium%3Dreferral%26utm_campaign%3Dfreesn">Bitrix24</a> .  All participants in the discussion are notified of new comments.  If you have said your word and you don‚Äôt need chat anymore, you can unsubscribe from notifications. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/3a0/26b/830/3a026b83087a4d74bc07444f60212514.png"><br><br>  The functionality of a live tape is not limited to this - you can create events (meetings, meetings), polls, announcements, etc.  Thanks to this tool, employees participating in individual projects, or all employees of the company, get access to current and relevant information.  This is useful for teams with dense employment of each employee (for example, developers, designers, PR specialists, marketers) - no need to be distracted by letters, calls, third-party chats, all the necessary information is available in one convenient and intuitive panel. <br><br>  In the case of a distributed team, perhaps the greatest difficulties arise in personnel management - employees must remain loyal and motivated, understand areas of responsibility and the overall structure of the company management.  This is important for a specialist of any level and profile, since all employees are part of the same team.  In addition, the fixed structure of the company, contacts, staff profiles help to quickly adapt to new employees.  Each employee has his own profile, where his personal data is indicated - phone numbers, calendar events, absence schedule.  It is very easy to find the right employee - for this there is a visual structure of the company, and you can already set the employee name in the search for the messenger.  If you do not know the name - it does not matter, the search is possible by department or position. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e95/aa3/207/e95aa32077664cfe876ebf607fb82653.png"></div><br><h3>  <b>Chats</b> </h3><br>  For personal correspondence chats are available - in the messenger (both on mobile and on the desktop) you can exchange messages.  Instant messengers are provided in the Bitrix24 messenger - the team will not miss a single event.  Business chat is available directly in the browser, for communication you do not need to install additional applications. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/abe/1fc/b25/abe1fcb25c5c40a58c35331e1351cd6b.png"></div><br>  In the Bitrix24 messenger you can communicate one-on-one, create group and thematic chats (for example, to discuss the details of the project).  The chat has built-in chat bots: ‚ÄúCounterparty Requisites‚Äù, which shows the full details of the TIN or OGRN and assistant Martha, a very intelligent and sociable bot that helps you work with the tools <a href="http://www.bitrix24.ru/%3Futm_source%3Dhabrhabr%26utm_medium%3Dreferral%26utm_campaign%3Dfreesn">‚ÄúBitrix24‚Äù</a> , jokes, comforts, trolls, reminds of urgent tasks and events.  Carefully, you can hang on talking! <br><br><h3>  <b>Video calls</b> </h3><br>  If you and your team are faced with a difficult question and you need to discuss something quickly, then it is better to discuss it by voice through telephony and video calls (up to 4 people).  With the help of video calls, employees will be able to communicate in person, show their screen to colleagues in the desktop application, so that without long explanations and endless screenshots, they will show layouts, prototypes, and even working copies.  This is especially important for teams that create things of the real world that need to be considered together, but sending them by mail or courier is difficult, time consuming, expensive, and sometimes because of the characteristics, it is completely impossible.  The videoconference mode allows you to invite experts or speakers to participate in events who are ready to share their experience, but who do not have the time for a personal visit - all you need to do is invite an expert to Bitrix24. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/4d2/fd0/e47/4d2fd0e4762e4a508e2be2f21ffb2349.png"></div><br><h3>  <b>post office</b> </h3><br>  Mail has always been and remains a significant business tool.  Now "Bitrix24" has a complete set of features for working with mail.  You can conduct business correspondence directly from Bitrix24, write letters, reply to them, attach files, and more.  All correspondence is stored in a convenient form.  A convenient (intelligent) search is carried out across the entire communication line - no letter will be lost and you can easily pick up the necessary correspondence at any time. <br><br>  The user profile is allocated a special email address to create a task.  After sending the letter to the specified e-mail, a task will be created in which the user is both the initiator and the responsible.  The text of the letter is transferred to the task and attachments are attached.  After automatic generation of the task, it can be edited. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e49/1d1/38f/e491d138f7b44a219a26ba007d986da7.png"><br><br>  <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/users/bitrix24/" class="user_link">Businesses are</a> fully available free mail with mailboxes on your own domain or on the <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/users/bitrix24/" class="user_link">bitrix24</a> domain and an unlimited amount of space.  In addition, Bitrix24 mail. Mail assumes antivirus and antispam - that is, employees will not have a lot of time to analyze mail.  Since our mail is based on Yandex technologies, we are confident in our service.  But if the company already has a favorite mailbox, you can simply connect it to Bitrix24, which will inform you about incoming letters. <br><br><h3>  <b>Telephony</b> </h3><br>  Built-in ‚Äú <a href="http://www.bitrix24.ru/%3Futm_source%3Dhabrhabr%26utm_medium%3Dreferral%26utm_campaign%3Dfreesn">Bitrix24‚Äù</a> ‚ÄúIP telephony is cheaper than traditional and cellular communication, allows the company to receive memorable city numbers, it is based on the company's internal telephone network (internal numbers).  In addition, it is beneficial to have your own virtual PBX: you can save on expensive equipment, call costs and at the same time monitor employee calls.  This, of course, is not about total control, but about monitoring for the purpose of quality control, selection of best practices for personnel training and resolution of possible conflicts with clients or within a team.  All the functionality is available in the mobile version thanks to Bitrix24.Softphone. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/0ea/260/e95/0ea260e95536426396ee7f6c2bef2171.png"></div><br>  In <a href="http://www.bitrix24.ru/%3Futm_source%3Dhabrhabr%26utm_medium%3Dreferral%26utm_campaign%3Dfreesn">Bitrix24,</a> you can work with external users - your partners, customers, contractors.  Invited staff can be seen in a separate list.  They can participate in discussions, projects, tasks in accordance with the rights issued.  This is the case when you can safely add external contractors to the portal: freelancers, partners, experts.  The separation of access rights to the sections ‚ÄúBitrix24‚Äù guarantees the security of accession of third parties. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0079db">Why a complete solution?</font> </h2><br>  In addition to the reasons we talked about at the beginning of the post, there are a few more points that need to be paid attention to when building the company's ICT infrastructure. <br><br><ul><li>  The company grows, develops, new divisions appear.  To ensure the activities and problem solving, new software is required: CRM, project management system, analytical dashboards.  Using an integrated solution ensures quick and seamless integration - in fact, you just plug in new modules into an already running system. <br><br></li><li>  In the case of expanding the set of software used, there is no need to migrate the database ‚Äî in a single tool, all data will be loaded into new modules automatically. <br><br></li><li>  With the expansion of the software does not need to train employees - they will continue to work in the familiar interface. </li></ul><br>  There are many companies that need exactly the internal functions, communications and corporate social network: <br><br><ul><li>  academic institutions </li><li>  non-profit societies, associations </li><li>  groups of remotely working developers, engineers, designers </li><li>  universities, student groups, graduate students and applicants </li><li>  freelancers and so on. </li></ul><br>  Any companies and communities will be able to organize collaboration and communication with the help of ‚ÄúBitrix24‚Äù.  <i>For example, take an abstract NPO that deals with helping adolescents in a difficult situation.</i>  <i>The organization has 7 branches throughout Russia, it is necessary to coordinate the work, conduct master classes, coordinator meetings and meetings with experts.</i>  <i>Initially, process management required several disparate programs and corporate mail, which was free of charge and subjected to attacks by spammers.</i>  <i>Using ‚ÄúBitrix24‚Äù, you can hold meetings and meetings, conduct correspondence, group documents into folders on Bitrix24.Disc, invite experts to the discussion.</i>  <i>You can also track the correspondence chains with each branch for each of the events.</i>  <i>All functionality is implemented for free, which is extremely important for NGOs.</i> <br><br>  Of course, commercial companies also do not stand aside - the corporate portal plays a significant role in the formation of teamwork skills, accelerated adaptation of new employees, in-house communications. <br><br>  Using an integrated solution, companies of any profile receive obvious benefits: <br><br><ul><li>  integration of internal and external information and business processes, the managers are absolutely obvious connections within Bitrix24 (employees, projects, project documents, discussion and chats on specific cases); <br><br></li><li>  data analysis in various sections and relationships - it is easy to obtain data on KPI, project progress, stages of customer relationships; <br><br></li><li>  organization of joint work of several divisions, external groups - there are significantly fewer questions for colleagues, the share of shifted responsibility decreases; <br><br></li><li>  automation of routine work and part of business processes. </li></ul><br>  As a result of competent implementation and use of elements of the ICT infrastructure, organization increases, labor productivity increases, service and communication with customers improves, the cost of services produced partly decreases (a frequent consequence of any automation).  In general, it is worth a try.  Moreover, this time they don‚Äôt take money for the experiments. <br><br><h4>  <b>Things are easy:</b> </h4>  <a href="http://www.bitrix24.ru/%3Futm_source%3Dhabrhabr%26utm_medium%3Dreferral%26utm_campaign%3Dfreesn">Register a free "Bitrix24" for an unlimited number of employees.</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/274953/">https://habr.com/ru/post/274953/</a></p>
