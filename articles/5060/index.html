Our studio is virtual - without office and staff.  It is better <br>  all, in my opinion, to give layout, design.  After all, the work of a designer or coder <br>  is episodic (for example, the creation of a common concept design site <br>  and technical design).  To have a good designer on staff, <br>  I need to give away $ 2500 per month (excluding taxes).  Same designer <br>  I can get for $ 400-600 as a freelancer.  With the coder is even easier - <br>  it has a clear scope of work, minimal documentation at the start. </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/03c/aa6/c65/03caa6c65b55cf5fa9a22c6ec9a75c2d.jpg" width="133" height="130" alt="Natalia Chanysheva (Noch)" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="left">  <strong>Natalia Chanysheva ( <a href="https://habr.com/ru/users/noch/" class="user_link">Noch</a> ):</strong> <br>  It's easiest for me to give layout and, in part, programming (its draft <br>  option).  Themselves to carry out the design, verification code, design.  Give away <br>  on outsourcing design I would never, because the correct technical <br>  task (TZ) - is 80% of the work. </p><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/b96/e75/385/b96e753855ee4462e199332ae0c6bd09.jpg" width="125" height="170" alt="Alexander Novoseltsev (Googenot)" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="right">  <strong>Alexander Novoseltsev ( <a href="https://habr.com/ru/users/googenot/" class="user_link">Googenot</a> ):</strong> <br>  In principle, almost any graphic design can be outsourced. <br>  works - flash, web, graphic design, illustration, logo creation.  BUT <br>  also text translations, layout, server administration, etc.  Administration <br>  has one feature - the freelancer gets access to the "holy of holies", <br>  therefore, this work is usually trusted to already proven freelancers. </p><br>  <strong>What are the risks of working with freelancers?</strong>  <strong>What are their strategies for reducing?</strong> <br><p>  <strong>Vyacheslav Terichev ( <a href="https://habr.com/ru/users/polosaty/" class="user_link">polosaty</a> ):</strong> The main risk is a freelancer <br>  may suddenly evaporate.  Solved safety doublers.  Further, the risk of absence <br>  mutual understanding.  This risk is reduced by the subjective assessment of ‚Äúadequacy‚Äù by <br>  preliminary negotiations.  If you speak different languages ‚Äã‚Äãinitially, <br>  it is unlikely you will find mutual understanding in consequence. </p><br><p>  <strong>Alexander Novoseltsev ( <a href="https://habr.com/ru/users/googenot/" class="user_link">Googenot</a> ):</strong> It happens, applicants <br>  To work slip the "left" portfolio.  As a rule, the style can be <br>  to distinguish between stolen works or not.  Often met programmers, without understanding <br>  principle of "work on the result."  Those.  you are not paid to work, <br>  but for the result!  You can work 1 hour from the allotted 10 days, but if you <br>  in an hour you will do everything that is asked of you, which means that you will receive money. </p><br>  <strong>How to determine the professional and personal qualities of a remote freelancer.</strong> <strong><br></strong>  <strong>Simply put, how to understand that a person is reliable and responsible?</strong> <br><p>  <strong>Vyacheslav Terichev ( <a href="https://habr.com/ru/users/polosaty/" class="user_link">polosaty</a> ):</strong> Professional <br>  I define quality based on the portfolio and communication with the person.  Well, personal ... <br>  Only a real project.  When I offer a job to a new person, I prepare <br>  safety option in case of problems.  In principle, a person can be seen on the first <br>  experience.  All the flaws, one way or another, can be traced. </p><br><p>  <strong>Natalia Chanysheva ( <a href="https://habr.com/ru/users/noch/" class="user_link">Noch</a> ):</strong> I took to the remote <br>  work (specialists from other cities) only 2 people - copywriters. <br>  I called them at my own expense and in the initial stages of the project I often spoke by phone. <br>  I really trust myself and my intuition - if it‚Äôs unpleasant for me to be with a person <br>  talking over a cup of coffee is likely to be difficult for us to work with. </p><br><p>  <strong>Alexander Novoseltsev ( <a href="https://habr.com/ru/users/googenot/" class="user_link">Googenot</a> ):</strong> Often arose <br>  the task is to assess the qualifications of the programmer.  If the freelancer is unfamiliar, <br>  sometimes we came up with small test tasks.  Another option is to test. <br>  the specialist is already on the project, having a backup option ‚Äúfor every fireman‚Äù. <br>  For example, we managed to agree with a regular customer to start with a simple project, <br>  complicating the work gradually.  As a result, the necessary programmers were themselves, not <br>  necessary - dropped out. </p><br><habracut></habracut><br>  <strong>What mistakes in the formation of freelance teams did you make?</strong> <br><p>  <strong>Vyacheslav Terichev ( <a href="https://habr.com/ru/users/polosaty/" class="user_link">polosaty</a> ):</strong> </p><br><ul><li>  <strong>Lack of a backup option.</strong>  Working with freelancers, <br>  even with the most reliable ones (for example, I have a programmer with whom I work <br>  7 years) you must necessarily have an alternative specialist.  To be <br>  ready for a situation where the performer simply disappears.  No matter what happens, it will fall. <br>  Internet provider, fall in love, go into the lead, sick ... For each member <br>  teams you must have a safety option. </li><li>  <strong>Lack of planning.</strong>  Need to make a schedule <br>  and keep up to date with all project participants.  Remember that man, for sure <br>  works not only for you. </li><li>  <strong>Lack of full project documentation.</strong>  Here <br>  everything is simple: to get exactly what you want, you need as clear as possible <br>  to describe. </li><li>  <strong>Need to negotiate on the shore.</strong>  Disclaim all conditions <br>  cooperation and the amount of work needed at the start, so that later there would be no mutual <br>  insults.  If you can not accurately determine the amount of work, it is better to negotiate this <br>  at the start. </li><li>  <strong>Require reporting.</strong>  It's simple: did - write it down. <br>  Better initially stipulate the form of communication.  For example, I prefer <br>  task setting and reporting by mail.  In ICQ - the only solution <br>  operational issues. </li></ul><br><p>  <strong>Natalia Chanysheva ( <a href="https://habr.com/ru/users/noch/" class="user_link">Noch</a> ):</strong> I showed weakness <br>  that she did not part with people as soon as she understood that we would not work together. <br>  The result was even worse for the project. </p><br><p>  <strong>Alexander Novoseltsev ( <a href="https://habr.com/ru/users/googenot/" class="user_link">Googenot</a> ):</strong> The main problem <br>  with which we faced - this is delaying the project.  Showed <br>  sentimentality: pity the programmer or designer, succumbed to his persuasion - to <br>  he will finish that number, and everything will be fine.  As a rule, the work remained <br>  unfinished on time and we waited for more.  Either they got what they wanted, but with errors. <br>  In general, if you are beginning to do the same with you - delay the project, then <br>  better get rid of such workers, and start working with new people.  Beginning <br>  with simple projects to check out a specialist. </p><br>  <strong>On average, what's the difference in paying for your work in the regions and in Moscow?</strong> <br><p>  <strong>Vyacheslav Terichev ( <a href="https://habr.com/ru/users/polosaty/" class="user_link">polosaty</a> ):</strong> In the case of programmers <br>  and maker-ups the difference often reaches 50-100%.  With designers everything is different: <br>  Moscow often manages to negotiate amounts lower than regional averages. </p><br><p>  <strong>Natalia Chanysheva ( <a href="https://habr.com/ru/users/noch/" class="user_link">Noch</a> ):</strong> I consider the principle of economy <br>  on the regions vicious.  Work costs as much as it costs.  I and in Omsk <br>  did not take up the article for less than $ 10 1,000 characters.  At that moment <br>  This was the average Moscow price.  And when I worked with copywriters from other <br>  cities, basically paid them as much as Moscow.  In addition to evaluation <br>  Professionalism is also a very correct emotional move.  Stop you <br>  in absentia and constantly be offended that "you are in Moscow for sure you overpay for your own, <br>  and save us. ‚Äù  Yes, there is always a risk that they will sit on your neck.  But it is a risk <br>  within the limits of one order - it is not lethal.  You just need to be able to part hard. </p><br><p>  <em>Interviewed by Yuri Vilnid ( <a href="https://habr.com/ru/users/vilnid/" class="user_link">vilnid</a> ).</em>  <em>The author thanks Natalia</em> <em><br></em>  <em>Chanyshev ( <a href="https://habr.com/ru/users/noch/" class="user_link">Noch</a> ) for reading the text.</em> </p></div>
