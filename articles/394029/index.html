  <section class="page js-page"><h1>American surgeons conducted the first successful penis transplantation in the country.</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  64-year-old Thomas Manning, who lost most of his penis in the fight against cancer, became the first American to have a penis transplanted.  The transplantation took 15 hours: seven surgeons sewed the nerves, veins and arteries of the recipient and the donor's organ of the deceased man.  They were assisted by 30 other specialists.  Doctors believe that all functions, including sexual, will return in a few weeks or months. <br><br>  Experimental transplantation was the beginning of a program aimed at a penis transplant to wounded veterans.  From 2001 to 2013, 1,367 men returned from Iraq and Afghanistan with various injuries to their genitals.  Among them - 18-20-year-old guys who have no hope of sex life, and who can not go to the toilet while standing.  These people are at high risk of suicide. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/eec/66a/0c2/eec66a0c24d2ab336466136fa3ff009e.jpg" width="600" alt="image"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Penis transplantation in the United States has become the third successful similar operation in the world.  In 2006, in China, surgeons for 15 hours worked on the transplantation of a 10-centimeter organ to a 44-year-old patient two times younger than him.  After 10 days, the blood supply was restored, but because of the ‚Äúpsychological problems‚Äù between the recipient and his wife, the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2006/sep/18/medicineandhealth.china">penis was separated</a> .  An examination of the organ did not show any signs of rejection.  Another successful operation was carried out in South Africa by a 21-year-old man in 2014, and doctors later said that the recipient's girl was <a href="http://edition.cnn.com/2015/06/12/health/penis-transplant-south-africa-pregnancy/">pregnant</a> .

According to them, such an operation should take about 12 hours.  The organ is obtained from a deceased man with the consent of the relatives.  Doctors require under a microscope to stitch from two to six nerves and as many veins and arteries.  After such an operation, the patient must use a urinary catheter for several weeks and then take medications to avoid rejection. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/bb4/ed1/496/bb4ed1496e2fbf8d6df8f2734aa9ca1d.png" width="600" alt="image"><br><br>  The US Department of Defense does not want veterans to act as guinea pigs after returning from the war.  Therefore, in the early stages of the program, doctors will focus on civilians. <br><br>  The first was the 64-year-old Thomas Manning, who lost most of his penis in the fight against cancer: a rare type of cancer that affects about 2000 men in the United States a year, led to a partial penelectomy.  As a result, Manning has only one inch left of the organ.  The patient is happy to volunteer for the operation.  As soon as a donor came to the Bank of the New England Organs with a suitable blood type and skin color, Thomas Manning was operated on. <br><br>  The cost of the operation is from 50 to 75 thousand dollars.  Hospitals will cover their own expenses, and doctors will sacrifice personal time.  The next patient could be a man who lost an organ in a fire during a car accident.  The procedure will be carried out only for men who have suffered from a disease or accident, but not for a sex change. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/394029/">https://habr.com/ru/post/394029/</a></p>
