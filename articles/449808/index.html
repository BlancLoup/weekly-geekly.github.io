    <h2>  Details </h2><br>  On the first day of the forum, on May 21, 2019, in the Tech &amp; Society section, bright and successful representatives of various business areas and creative professions will present their way to develop critical thinking and tell how its use affected their self-discovery and path to success. <br><br>  Each speaker will receive a fifteen-minute slot, during which, in Story Telling format, the viewer will be presented with examples of critical thinking and their significant influence on the path of each hero, examples of world view from an unusual angle and the creation of new reality, the birth of new projects and their successful implementation. <br><br>  The program section already announced: <br><br><ul><li>  <b>Dmitry Kostomarov</b> , entrepreneur, business angel.  One of his most successful projects is e-Queo, a native mobile business communications and management platform operating in companies such as MTS, Megafon, L ªOreal, Henkel, X5 Retail Group, etc .; </li><li>  <b>Edouard Maas</b> , founder and CEO of ZOGRAS, a new generation information and analytical platform.  Since 2013, he headed the innovation direction in one of the world's largest news agencies TASS; </li><li>  <b>Lev Paley</b> , Head of IT Department for Information Security at JSC SO UES, Member of the Association of Heads of Information Security Services (ARISB); </li><li>  <b>Andrei Razmahnin</b> , psychiatrist, creator of a VR application that relieves stress; </li><li>  <b>Vadim Chekletsov</b> , Ph.D. (Philosophy), Institute of Philosophy, Russian Academy of Sciences, Executive Director of the Russian IoT Center, and others. </li></ul><br><h2>  Share your experience </h2><br>  Not only successful businessmen and bright representatives of other spheres of activity can get to the number of speakers, but also non-immediate, but equally bright and critical-minded individuals - to participate in the section, it is enough to have time <a href="https://www.phdays.com/ru/join/tech-society/">to submit an application to extra-CFP</a> before May 11. <br><br>  There are no thematic restrictions for speakers: you can share an example from any field of activity or even private life.  The key condition is not just to bring your case, talk about breaking constants and how critical thinking contributed to the birth of a new project or new reality, but to be able to engage the audience, inspire it to break the patterns and their own accomplishments.  Do not miss your chance to share your success story! <br><br>  The audience itself will appreciate all performances: each viewer will have the opportunity to interact with speakers and independently evaluate the proposed cases, stories and hypotheses from the point of view of critical thinking and their applicability to the realization of their ideas. <br><br>  All participants in the Tech &amp; Society section will be able to plunge into the world of business, creativity, intellectual development and the achievement of personal goals;  to gain experience of a versatile perception of information beyond the framework of automatism and ingrained patterns and skills of breaking patterns;  compare the possible options of their judgments with the judgments of the speakers.  Well, of course, chat with people who have similar interests and ways of thinking and be inspired by their own accomplishments. <br><br>  We remind you that <a href="https://phdays19.ruwidgets.ru/">tickets to the forum are already on sale</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/449808/">https://habr.com/ru/post/449808/</a></p>
