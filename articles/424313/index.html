Provide new opportunities to save time on routine procedures. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/qo/bo/-n/qobo-nju1aukjzusjqgnxvocb-0.png" alt="image"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Three years ago, I already <a href="https://habr.com/post/250233/">wrote</a> about the program, during which time it has been greatly transformed, new opportunities have appeared and the old ones have been radically reworked.  All functions of the program work stably on 99% of computers.  It was decided many problems associated with switching layouts and at the moment it works an order of magnitude better than its competitors.  At the same time, most of the program's functions became paid, unfortunately there is not enough enthusiasm for development, which takes quite a lot of time.
