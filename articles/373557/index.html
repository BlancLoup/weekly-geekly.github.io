Students at Portsmouth University in southern England seem to have taken the words of the writer to heart. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/bb2/118/bee/bb2118bee988383212183003751b4971.jpg"><br><br>  The academic institute is hidden in the city of Portsmouth, which the English associate with a bustling port and navy.  But now the place of sailors took 25 thousand students. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/74b/ad9/702/74bad97022866c728766f6e5c95084f4.jpg">

      At the center of this student‚Äôs nest is a library, which has become the unofficial town hall and communication center for Portsmouth students.  The university administration has not yet reported cases where students literally moved into the library building, but the institution‚Äôs representatives openly say that the once stuffy and cramped building became the core of student interaction. <br><br>  Information Services Director Andrew Minter says: ‚ÄúBefore the update, the library felt as if entering a large call center ‚Äî faceless and static.  And now in this place literally life is in full swing. ‚Äù <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/684/3c4/b65/6843c4b65b35a59d6ec52723eb61bc8f.jpg"><br><br><h2>  <font color="#d8291e">Study no longer passes in silence</font> </h2><br>  ‚ÄúThe library is a more social place than any other,‚Äù confirms second-year student Anita Sophia Nieto.  The campus administration agrees with these words, because they well reflect the success of Portsmouth in establishing a culture of social learning and creative interaction. <br><br>  ‚ÄúLearning was considered a very quiet process, but when you have a real job, you begin to communicate with other people,‚Äù says Minter.  ‚ÄúStudents have never been so socialized during their studies;  they learn from each other and from each other. " <br><br>  Most of all, the new library is similar to the interactive platform of the future, and not the cramped cave from the episode in Roald Dahl's novel.  There are 1,400 unique classrooms in the room, starting with conference rooms and ending with couches.  They are perfect to sit down with one of 380,000 books - or at least one of 350 Lenovo ThinkPad E460 laptops.  Most libraries rent books.  Portsmouth Library gives laptops. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/e70/ccd/a3b/e70ccda3bd458c9a31e799fbaafd5ffc.jpg"><br><br><h2>  <font color="#d8291e">Laptop Issuing Library</font> </h2><br>  These ThinkPads are important for an updated library management center: using their ID card, students get half a day access to a fully charged laptop and software installed on it.  ‚ÄúGiving us laptops has changed everything,‚Äù says Sovmuya Shah, a third year student of environmental sciences. <br><br>  Creating such a space required investment, but Minter explained that the cost of laptops and cabinets was like "half the cost of a finished PC."  Thus, for the remaining funds have subscribed to the database and software. <br><br>  Minter found that laptops contributed to teamwork, which improves material absorption and tasks are performed more quickly.  And since students are young people, the ability to choose their workplace gives a sense of independence. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/df6/718/ded/df6718ded1def984facad92a252b1a56.jpg"><br><br><h2>  <font color="#d8291e">Standalone notebook slots</font> </h2><br>  As the administration says, the concept of lockers stemmed from the desire to make education more social, not closed.  For the same reason, access to all technological rooms is open. <br><br>  Renting a laptop is elementary, but when embodying the idea, the administration faced a number of problems, says Craig Browning, a senior service delivery specialist. <br><br>  ‚ÄúIt was just an idea,‚Äù he says.  ‚ÄúThe university was the first platform for the supplier of such lockers, so we kept asking ourselves: how to do this?‚Äù <br><br>  But the university has a reputation as a harbinger of innovation and creative thinking.  The team of technical specialists turned out to be new to the academic institutions of the territory.  After the initial creation and implementation - as well as the removal of minor shortcomings - the boxes have been working since 2013. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/89b/ac9/516/89bac95168fabcaf9c01699f184f274d.jpg"><br><br><h2>  <font color="#d8291e">Social learning</font> </h2><br>  Browning and his team chose the Lenovo ThinkPad E460 because they are lighter and more durable than other computers.  This means that they can withstand the intensive exploitation of thousands of students. <br><br>  ‚ÄúThinkPads are very strong,‚Äù says Browning.  ‚ÄúThey need to be like this.‚Äù <br><br>  Browning witnessed students work on laptops, throwing piles of books over them with one hand and holding coffee in the other. <br><br>  And since the university is in England, terrible weather is added.  Shah says that "lockers allow you not to worry about pouring or damaging our personal computers." <br><br>  Positive feedback from students prompted the university to install new lockers and to buy more and more ThinkPad every year.  Teachers even began to ask laptops in classrooms to make the learning process more flexible and suitable for the needs of students. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/126/48c/cb2/12648ccb21bfb274ff0d05cf2dc34a12.jpg"><br><br>  Undoubtedly, laptops have become widely used on university campuses.  Students who study without personal computers can use the ThinkPad training.  For example, the third year student Freya Futner stole a laptop at the beginning of the semester, and the ThinkPad became her main assistant in the work on her dissertation. <br><br>  ‚ÄúI did all the research for a thesis on these laptops,‚Äù said Futner, who had just spent half a day in the library.  ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know what I would do without a ThinkPad.‚Äù </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/373557/">https://habr.com/ru/post/373557/</a></p>
