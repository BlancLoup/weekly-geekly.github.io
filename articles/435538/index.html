And it brings relevant results. <br><br>  According to the Fraunhofer Institute, last year in this country "green" sources gave more energy than thermal power plants that use coal.  In the first case, it is 40% of all electricity produced in Germany, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-germany-power-renewables/renewables-overtake-coal-as-germanys-main-energy-source-idUSKCN1OX0U2">in the second - 38%</a> .  Two percent is not such a big difference, but it is significant - without a doubt, the world is switching to renewable energy (where it is possible). <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Coal has long played a major role in Germany as an energy source.  It is still important, but its value is gradually leveled.  The same Germany closed its last coal mine in November.  The resource is now <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-11-30/germany-closes-last-coal-mine-despite-decades-of-supplies-needed">imported from other countries</a> , including Russia, the USA, Colombia and other countries.  The number of TPPs, which are now 120 in Germany, will also gradually decrease.

      The country is building more and more wind farms.  Last year, the amount of electricity generated by wind increased by 5.4%.  This year, the increase will be even more significant, in any case, analysts say.  In fact, in 2019, the wind will take the second most important position as a source of electricity.  The first is still occupied by coal. <br><br>  According to some experts, the country's success in introducing renewable energy is largely due to favorable weather conditions, including the configuration of the wind rose.  Indeed, last year the winds in Germany were stronger than usual.  On the other hand, the year was hot, which means that the amount of energy generated by hydroelectric power plants has decreased.  But the amount of electricity generated by solar power stations has increased. <br><br>  Natural gas as well as nuclear power plants still operate in the country.  They plan to get rid of the latter by 2022 (to be fair, it should be noted that in France, another developed European country, nuclear power plants pay much attention and do not plan to get rid of this source). <br><br>  In addition, in Germany, and engaged in other "green" projects.  For example, last year the first hydrogen train in the world was launched here.  Other European countries are also trying to reduce the value of combustible minerals in the energy sector.  For example, Portugal in March last year managed to produce "green" energy more than the entire country required.  During the year, this situation was repeated several times - for several days the country received more energy from renewable sources than was even required. <br><br>  Similarly, in the UK, it is planned to gradually move away from coal as the main source of electricity.  For two years, the country has made significant progress in this direction.  It also <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2018/04/portugal-set-some-big-renewable-energy-records-in-march/">marks the days</a> when renewable energy is generated as much as industry and households require. <br><br> <a href="http://madrobots.ru/%3Futm_source%3Dhabr.com%26amp%3Butm_medium%3Dpr%26amp%3Butm_campaign%3Dgreenenergy"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/qq/g0/i7/qqg0i7eriq4febfjqqehire4fnw.png"></a> <br> <a href="http://madrobots.ru/about/mails/%3Futm_source%3Dhabr.com%26amp%3Butm_medium%3Dpr%26amp%3Butm_campaign%3Dgreenenergy"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/bv/1y/yw/bv1yywjgl2_cbtzvvtk4rup2jz8.png"></a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/435538/">https://habr.com/ru/post/435538/</a></p>
