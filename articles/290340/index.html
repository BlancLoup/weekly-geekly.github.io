Can such tools help in writing a quality product? <br><br>  The development process from the outside does not seem so complicated: the team of programmers receives the assignment and funding, and at the output issues a product that the customer needs.

If a stable pulse is a good indicator, an uneven one is a signal of internal problems. <br><br>  For a small project, finding the causes of deterioration is not an overly complex task.  Unfortunately, this cannot be said about projects in which several teams are involved in the development of the same product at once. <br><br>  Efficiency and quality of development depend on a number of factors: <br><ul><li>  individual productivity of developers; </li><li>  release stability </li><li>  speed of adaptation to changing conditions and flexibility of the project; </li><li>  use of remote resources; </li><li>  level and ways of interaction between the client and developers. </li></ul><br><br>  Without a doubt, an integral part of the release of a successful software product - competent organization of the workflow.  Project management tools are designed to help solve such problems. <br><br>  Using good management tools allows the client to get a clear picture of how the team copes with its tasks, assess the degree of product availability by the end of the next sprint / iteration. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h6>  Overview </h6><br>  Now there are more than one hundred project management solutions on the market, each has strengths and weaknesses.  This article is an overview of the most popular tools for managing Agile projects, according to a survey conducted among colleagues in DataArt. <br><br>  The survey involved 39 people from 32

It allows all interested parties to participate in development using a single solution.  Use TFS to manage disparate projects and teams. <br><br>  <b>Version Control System</b> <br>  Support for a centralized (Team Foundation Version Control) or distributed (Git) system in Team Foundation Server gives the team the flexibility to use version control technology that is better suited to it. <br><br>  <b>Agile planning and interaction</b> <br>  Adapt Agile practices at your own pace, using Scrum, Agile or CMMI¬Æ templates.  You can download process templates or create your own.  All project participants are involved in the workflow with the help of Kanban boards and constantly receive feedback from each other. <br><br>  <b>Builds</b> <br>  TFS helps identify errors and product quality problems at an early stage.  Configuring continuous integration (continuous integration) with the launch of integration tests increases confidence in the quality of builds. <br>  TFS also provides information on the status of the latest build on the project‚Äôs home page and through Visual Studio. <br><br>  <b>Web interface for test case management</b> <br>  The system allows you to control the quality through the web interface, create and run test scripts remotely, which will facilitate review for the team.  You can also profile unit tests to track continuous code execution, including unit testing itself. <br><br>  <b>Reporting</b> <br>  The reporting framework in Team Foundation Server 2013 tracks various types of work to create reports based on current status.  And templates for obtaining information can be taken ready-made or compiled by oneself. <br><br>  <b>TFS Price</b> <br><table><tbody><tr><td>  Purchase <br></td><td>  Upgrade <br></td></tr><tr><td>  $ 499 <br></td><td>  $ 399 <br></td></tr></tbody></table><br><br>  <b>Pricing policy</b> : subscription, free 90-day version. <br><br>  <b>Screenshots</b> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/2a4/bfa/0d7/2a4bfa0d7074465fa86581902e987337.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/9ad/1fa/d3c/9ad1fad3cf0e448d94930b1713ec5e6e.jpg"><br><br><h4>  <b>Google docs</b> </h4><br>  <b>Special features</b> <br><ul><li>  Backlog and product combustion diagram. </li><li>  Backlog and combustion diagram for the sprint. </li><li>  Backlog for constraints. </li><li>  Burndown chart, team velocity. </li></ul><br>  Specially created Scrum templates help to manage a small project.  The most important advantage of the solution is simplicity: no additional installation and configuration is required.  Google Docs is a great choice for distributed teams. <br><br>  <b>Screenshots</b> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/7bc/e27/e2d/7bce27e2d8814c7c8b71ccafa1f0582e.png"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/300/42e/7a8/30042e7a8a5346f3b01c8c2e807ce0d4.png"><br><br>  <b>Google Docs Price</b> <br>  <b>Price model</b> : free (1 GB of disk space). <br><br><h4>  <b>Conclusion</b> </h4><br>  Choosing a tool specifically for your project is not an easy task.  Solving it, it is important to have a clear idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe following points: <br><ul><li>  How many people work in your team, how many employees will use the tool. </li><li>  Are there any employees working remotely? </li><li>  How scalable the solution is with the growing number of users. </li><li>  How flexible is the pricing policy of the company offering the service. </li><li>  How do you plan to implement the tool and what level of support you expect. </li></ul><br><br>  The products reviewed (except Google Docs) have a free trial.  During this time, the team can check the tool in action on a real project and see how the tool helps in solving development and planning issues. <br><br>  Summing up, it can be noted that VersionOne and Rally companies provide a wide range of tools for managing Agile projects.  With their help, the customer can track the progress of the team and see what difficulties the developers face in the process of completing tasks. Since remote work in the field of IT is very common nowadays, products from VersionOne and Rally help to make work in a distributed team as convenient as possible. <br><br>  Microsoft TFS does not lag behind competitors.  The advantages of the product are especially noticeable when the team is already using other solutions from Microsoft. <br><br>  Atlassian JIRA is well suited for project management and bugtracking.  Many plug-ins allows you to customize and optimize processes for your needs. <br><br>  Google Docs is a handy tool for small teams with relatively simple processes.  The main advantage (except for free) - ease of use and intuitive interface. <br><br>  I hope the review was helpful and will help you choose the right tool. <br><br>  Author: Evgeny Tolbakov. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/290340/">https://habr.com/ru/post/290340/</a></p>
