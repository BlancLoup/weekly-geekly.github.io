He was completely paralyzed, lost his ability to control his arms and legs.  Such injuries have always been considered incurable.  Until yesterday. <br><br>  On April 13, 2016, experts at Ohio State University announced that they were <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/14/health/paralysis-limb-reanimation-brain-chip.html">able to regain partial control</a> over the right hand and fingers of Berkhart.  An experimental cybernetic technology was used for the treatment: the implanted chip in the brain sends signals to the muscles directly, bypassing the spinal cord.  This is the first in the history of medicine case of restoration of control over the brush in a patient with <abbr title="Paralysis of the arms and legs">quadriplegia</abbr> . <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d75/893/c08/d75893c08c5841a896ce57b8f30a0823.png">

      The implant is connected via a computer interface to a sleeve with 130 electrodes on the arm.  For two years after introducing the chip, Ian trained to focus his thoughts, observing the results on a computer screen in the laboratory.  As a result, the training brought success. <br><br>  Of course, control of the hand and fingers severely limits the arsenal of movements.  Ian is paralyzed below the chest, retaining partial control only of the shoulders and biceps.  Now he got the opportunity to press buttons, play computer games, perform many other actions. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/6d1/dd3/891/6d1dd389105844c6add7297bb99ce1f7.jpg"><br>  <i>Paralyzed man playing Guitar Hero</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/30f/4a9/d17/30f4a9d17dee453fac4dd9cd64c8a739.jpg"><br><br>  Brain surgery carried out in 2014.  Previously, tomography was performed to determine a specific area that is responsible for the movement of the extremities in the motor cortex in the anterior central gyrus of the left hemisphere (just above the ear).  During the operation, this area was thoroughly tested to clarify the location for the implant. <br><br>  ‚ÄúWe spent an hour and a half determining the exact location,‚Äù <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/14/health/paralysis-limb-reanimation-brain-chip.html">said</a> Ali Rezai, surgeon and director of the Neuromodulation Center at Ohio State University. <br><br>  A chip with 96 contacts (microelectrodes) was placed in this place, which record the activity of neurons. <br><br>  After surgery and recovery began numerous training.  The software for processing the brain signal was created by scientists from the non-profit Battelle Memorial Institute.  After each training session, the program was calibrated, because the signal changed significantly from workout to workout. <br><br>  Ian Berkhart says the workouts were exhausting.  ‚ÄúAvatar‚Äù on a computer screen (3D-model of a hand) made him try different types of movements. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/511/d08/e2d/511d08e2d04f49429d390f40e9eb2b8d.jpg"><br><br>  The signal was transmitted to a sleeve with 130 electrodes.  ‚ÄúI had to concentrate very, very much just to do things that I had previously done without thinking at all,‚Äù says Ian.  ‚ÄúBut it's like a sport, you try again and again, and gradually it becomes easier.‚Äù  The first results appeared after a few months, then for the first time he was able to move the brush himself, without the help of an avatar. <br><br>  After a year of training, he could already take a bottle, pour the contents into a mug, take a straw with his fingers and drink. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/2d1/893/aaa/2d1893aaa9384f44b229d0c2b4d127b2.jpg"><br><br>  In the end, according to the American medical classification, his disability could be reclassified from degree C5 to less severe C7. <br><br>  Unfortunately, the funding of the research project ends this year, soon Berkhard will return home, where he will return to his former life of the almost completely paralyzed disabled person. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/60fAjaRfwnU%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700022,15700186,15700190,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhgpowNr02q_l0RxruQMrOu8bVtQyA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  The results of scientific work <a href="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/nature17435.html">published in the journal Nature</a> (doi: 10.1038 / nature.2016.19749). </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/393009/">https://habr.com/ru/post/393009/</a></p>
