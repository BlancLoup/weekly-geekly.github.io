As soon as the daughters were diagnosed, on the same day we were told to say, wait, after 15 years the problem will be solved, everything will be fine. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e1d/7a5/df0/e1d7a5df087c43e4b54ada38da2d872b.jpg"><br><br>  In general, ‚Äúfuturology in diabetes‚Äù is a topic for one big dissertation.  In the meantime, both we and others have to simply improve the quality of compensation and wait for new opportunities for self-control.  One option that is promised is a non-invasive blood glucose meter.  And for those who are interested, I will tell you something about this niche of gadgets. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  I'll start a little from afar.  I do not believe in conspiracy theories that "the medicine has already been invented, they just do not give it to us to earn."  The leading scientists of the world are working on the problem of diabetes.

      Already at the beginning of the century, purified rabbit cells were transplanted in Russia: Professor <a href="http://www.nkj.ru/archive/articles/4314/">N. N. Skaletsky</a> worked on it, since 1987, together with the doctor, whom we are currently seeing, <a href="http://endocrin-dispanser.ru/%25D0%25BE%25D1%2582%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D1%258F/%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B5%25D1%2582%25D1%2581%25D0%25BA%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B5-%25D1%258D%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B4%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BA%25D1%2580%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BB%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B3%25D0%25B8%25D1%2587%25D0%25B5%25D1%2581%25D0%25BA%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B5/">I. E. Volkov</a> . <br><br>  From a short correspondence with Skaletsky, we learned that the research had long since ceased. <br><br>  The main direction now, in my opinion, is not the search for a pill for diabetes, but the development of tools that facilitate its flow, improve compensation, to put it simply: simplifying life. <br><br>  <b>Non-invasive blood glucose meters</b> <br><br>  In short - they are not. <br><br>  To be honest, this is the reason not only developers, but also marketers, who are very focused on their efforts, but - not there.  One of the key points of the ‚Äúutility‚Äù of such a device is indicated: no need to pierce a finger daily. <br><br>  Firstly, this is not a problem.  A small child (3 years) quite calmly treats punctures of the finger, does not cry, does not resent.  An adult person endures it even easier.  Secondly, not all follow even the basic recommendations for measurements (at least 4 times a day): check in the morning and evening.  Third, for example, as we have: pump + blood glucose meter.  On the one hand, an additional non-invasive blood glucose meter would not be a hindrance, but it would not change much.  And since the meter helps to calculate the bolus, it has settings and coefficients, etc. <br><br>  <b>What would really matter to us</b> <br><br>  One of the important ideas concluded at the end of a non-invasive glucometer, which, as it were, under the onslaught of advertisers, often fades into the background: this is the possibility of continuous monitoring of glucose! <br><br>  This possibility is realized in some pumps, and this year it promises to improve Medtronic, <a href="http://medgadgets.ru/novosti-2/nauka-i-issledovaniya/zdorovye/diabet/medtronic.html%3Futm_source%3Dgeek%26utm_medium%3Ddiabet%26utm_campaign%3Dmedtronic">creating an</a> ‚ÄúArtificial pancreas‚Äù.  A group of French scientists <a href="http://medgadgets.ru/novosti-2/nauka-i-issledovaniya/zdorovye/diabet/iskusstvennaya-zheleza.html%3Futm_source%3Dgeek%26utm_medium%3Ddiabet%26utm_campaign%3Dfrance">worked on a</a> similar project.  Yes it is a lot of who: on Geektimes they already <a href="https://geektimes.ru/post/275506/">wrote about</a> how similar closed-circuit pumps were made for themselves. <br><br>  So here.  For example, we measure sugar about 10 times a day.  And, judging by some measurements, this amount is clearly not enough: it happens when a child ‚Äúfails‚Äù for no reason at all.  Here you had a slightly elevated - about 8-9, after 20 minutes she asked for a snack, you measure to calculate the bolus, and - 2.9. <br><br>  So constant monitoring is a necessary thing at times.  Some pumps take this part: Medtronic, noticing low sugar, turns off insulin delivery. <br><br>  Solving the problem of systematic monitoring would make it possible to give ‚Äúsignificance‚Äù to such an indicator as glycated hemoglobin, for example, which in our clinical tradition is considered not to be the most revealing result.  The fact is that with measurements from 3 to 4 times a day with sugar jumps from 3 to 10 on average, then you will have a normal number for three months, and everything seems to be good, but in fact it is not. <br><br>  Therefore, the phrase ‚Äúnon-invasive blood glucose meter‚Äù has recently been supplanted by ‚Äúconstant monitoring,‚Äù because a constant, stable sugar is normally much more important than the absence of holes in the fingers. <br><br>  <b>Partially invasive</b> <br><br>  All the concepts that exist now and are called "non-invasive" by and large - "partially invasive", that is, one puncture allows you to take measurements in a few days.  In Russia, since November of last year, one such meter is expected - <a href="https://www.freestylelibre.co.uk/libre/">Abbot Freestile Libre</a> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/feb/50a/fe6/feb50afe6ffc4f9f9bdd34b762a59123.jpg"><br><br>  The device consists of several parts: one of them is fixed on the body for a period of up to 5 days, the second is a sensor that reads data using a wireless protocol.  In Russia, until now, if my memory serves me, it is still ‚Äúgray‚Äù. <br><br>  Similar, but again, partially-invasive concept project: <a href="http://www.nemauramedical.com/sugarbeat/">SugarBeat</a> , which includes patches that are mounted on the skin, sensor-reader + special application, so that data can always be before your eyes in a convenient form: on a smart watch, tablets, smartphones.  Expected in the world - in 2017. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/05d/2a5/1a2/05d2a51a287b49228d43ff33a1554fc3.jpg"><br><br>  Another prototype is GlucoTrak: a blood glucose meter, which, as stated on the official website, includes several technologies: ultrasonic, electromagnetic, thermal ... You can buy it in <a href="http://www.glucotrack.com/distributor/">some countries</a> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b67/a54/aa0/b67a54aa06de4e1fa22d7aed965b539a.jpg"><br><br>  The device is a sensor-clip, which is attached to the ear, and a reader.  At the same time, when developers are talking about the possibilities of continuous, painless monitoring, it is hard to believe in it: I don‚Äôt imagine that someone constantly walks with such a pin on the ear. <br><br>  <a href="http://www.gluco-wise.com/">GlucoWise</a> - is positioned as a 100% non-invasive blood glucose meter.  It is at the concept stage, but using it constantly is also a dubious advantage. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/9a5/17f/4c2/9a517f4c215d4842a05858b1bdf87710.jpg"><br><br>  This method of measurement, albeit painless, but with constant monitoring assumes that one hand will always be busy.  Hard to imagine. <br><br>  <b>Was there?</b> <br><br>  The problem of creating and implementing a non-invasive blood glucose meter is very old!  About 30 years of development in this direction, and in the past decade, large companies have joined this ‚Äúgame‚Äù.  Goolge is always a good example, and I'm <a href="http://medgadgets.ru/novosti-2/nauka-i-issledovaniya/zdorovye/diabet/google-glyukometr.html%3Futm_source%3Dgeek%26utm_medium%3Ddiabet%26utm_campaign%3Dgoogle">not</a> even <a href="http://medgadgets.ru/novosti-2/nauka-i-issledovaniya/zdorovye/diabet/google-glyukometr.html%3Futm_source%3Dgeek%26utm_medium%3Ddiabet%26utm_campaign%3Dgoogle">talking about smart lenses</a> . <br><br>  Trying to explore the possibilities of infrared spectroscopy.  More on this <a href="http://www.edn.com/design/systems-design/4422840/Non-invasive-blood-glucose-monitoring-using-near-infrared-spectroscopy">great stuff</a> .  At MIT, there is a <a href="https://dspace.mit.edu/handle/1721.1/34131">discussion of the topic</a> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e1d/7a5/df0/e1d7a5df087c43e4b54ada38da2d872b.jpg"><br>  <i>As you can see, the sample is far from gray.</i> <br><br>  In addition to <a href="http://www.mdpi.com/2075-4418/3/4/385/htm">small articles</a> in which, as here, I, the authors try to summarize the experience of research, trial and error, there is a <a href="http://www.mendosa.com/The%2520Pursuit%2520of%2520Noninvsive%2520Glucose,%2520Fourth%2520Edition.pdf">whole book</a> !  which describes more than 30 years of experience finding a non-invasive way to measure glucose in the blood! <br><br>  To date, only one known <b>non-invasive</b> method, <a href="https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/cdrh_docs/pdf/P990026S008b.pdf">approved by the FDA</a> - GlucoWatch.  Surprisingly, he had no success, and did not arouse any interest at the start of sales.  The model belonged to the medical company <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cygnus_Inc">Cygnus Inc</a> , which ceased to exist in 2007. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/798/9b9/5a0/7989b95a0a134f939a5ff9b961fe5373.jpg"><br><br>  The company actively conducted research, but <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10573275">some of them</a> confirmed that the results are rarely reproducible, and in general, they say, it is necessary to test further. <br><br>  Surprisingly, this device managed to <a href="http://www.dia-club.ru/forum_ru/viewtopic.php%3Ft%3D103">get to Russia</a> . <br><br>  In general, while we are waiting ... <br>  Take care of yourself! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/402741/">https://habr.com/ru/post/402741/</a></p>
