  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Column ‚ÄúOthers‚Äù: about budget smartphones and local brands. Afterword</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Surely, many people still remember the <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/smartgadget/blog/190534/">August note of</a> my colleague <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/alexeystar/" class="user_link">alexeystar</a> , which dealt with the onset of B-brands on the Russian smartphone market.  Actually, this phenomenon can already be observed with the naked eye and without deep statistics, analytics.  It is enough to go to the forum of some large network covering several dozen Russian cities to see how zealously the second echelon is pressing.  Shortly after the publication of the material, I came across a <a href="http://www.pcmag.ru/reviews/sub_detail.php%3FID%3D48387%26SUB_PAGE%3D0">very curious note from the</a> notorious PC Magazine / RE edition, where strange things are observed. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage3/955/b7c/44d/955b7c44d3a01aa07e063078934b36f5.jpg"><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  The PC Magazine / RE website posted an article entitled ‚ÄúModern smartphones: a business proposition.‚Äù  But my attention was attracted not so much by the material itself, but rather by the table ‚ÄúManufacturers Rating‚Äù given in it, where the brands of the smartphone market are located in descending from top to bottom.  The explanation says that the rating is calculated ‚Äúas a function of the average rating of all models of the manufacturer‚Äù.  So, we have the TOP-20 and almost a third of the brands that, with all our desire, you can‚Äôt carry to the class "A".  But the order of location is much more interesting - look, Ritmix is ‚Äã‚Äãrated higher than Lenovo, while Explay and Fly bypassed HTC.  Highscreen did become the only B-brand with 9 out of 10 possible points.  This is despite the fact that "ten" got only Samsung.

As it turned out, a total of 556 smartphones from 43 brands participated in the rating, the results of the study were evaluated on a 10-point scale.  In essence, a feasibility analysis of price / quality or, roughly speaking, a maximum of functions per dollar was carried out.  High scores at the same time means that vendors have relatively more models with a good rating in different niches.  By the way, this rating becomes the main choice for the laureates of the award ‚ÄúBest Products of the Year.‚Äù  Read more about the selection technique <a href="http://pcmag.ru/reviews/sub_detail.php%3FID%3D47846%26SUB_PAGE%3D0">here</a> . <br><br>  The human factor in the construction of the rating is minimized.  In principle, the explanation of Oleg Lebedev is best illustrated by the quotation from the link given, this method is also used in the ‚Äúmanufacturers rating‚Äù: ‚ÄúOur method for evaluating the best products is based on an impartial automated analysis with the calculation of points on the entire market landscape.  Thanks to an extensive database of technical and price information, as well as original algorithms, it provides a unified reference base for assessments, which leaves no room for opinions in the ‚ÄúI see so‚Äù style. <br><br>  Having found out the details of the rating, I, of course, inquired how this B-brands like Highscreen (Fly, Explay, etc.) manage to bypass much more eminent competitors?  In general, the answer lies on the surface and corresponds to the above description: usually this picture happens if there are quite a few models with good features and a price tag.  And the models are fixed in different price niches.  As a result, a high place in the rating cannot be obtained at the expense of a single smartphone. <br><br>  Perhaps, the conclusions are obvious and only once again confirm what could be seen in the Euroset report on sales of telephones in Russia for the first half of 2013.  We definitely will not be bored - the intrigue of confrontation is just beginning to develop.  Last spring, ‚Äúapproximate‚Äù sources told me about the serious intention of the first echelon to drop pride and rush into the middle / lower price segments with interesting characteristics, enlisting support, including MediaTek.  And when we see some Samsung and B-brand on the shelf of the store with the same characteristics and price, the choice will certainly not be in favor of the latter.  However, the second echelon is not lagging behind and, as the insiders say, they will ‚Äúmirror‚Äù to respond with breakthroughs in the flagship categories.  We are waiting ... <br><br>  PS It's funny, when clicking on links from an article to PC Magazine / RE, the following original notice is issued: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage3/db8/b81/fdc/db8b81fdc3d9cc66e8ac99a5922c042f.jpg"><br><br>  Apparently, PC Magazine in this case, preferred to be content with statistics, rather than go into analytics. <br><br>  PPS In the comments on Habrahabr, so many of the original PC Magazine / RE attitudes were noted back in 2011.  But. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/193224/">https://habr.com/ru/post/193224/</a></p>
