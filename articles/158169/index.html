However, we, as technical people to the bone marrow, are interested in something else: is it possible, in the process of running training, to use the full power of technical progress to achieve maximum results? <br>  Therefore, this article more closely echoes the old description: <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/97181/">several running devices</a> , taking into account past years and the current state of affairs in the field of devices for sports and running. <br>  Everything that is described in the article was tested by personal experience, all screenshots and results are taken from personal data. <br><br>  <b>Baseline data:</b> one conditional ‚ÄúIT specialist‚Äù, having crossed the line of 30 years, and 90 kg. <br>  <b>It is necessary: ‚Äã‚Äãto</b> interest tehnogika with simple trainings that help to keep fit, lose weight and strengthen the heart. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/390/95b/1c1/39095b1c1c255ff1277ff2eae93c8f38.jpg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The main technical characteristics of the instruments used, which, in my opinion, make sense to the user, are summarized in the table: <br><table><tbody><tr><th>  <b>Characteristic</b> </th><th>  <b>Garmin Forerunner 410/610</b> </th><th>  <b>miCoach</b> </th><th>  <b>Nike +</b> </th><th>  <b>Polar FT40</b> </th></tr><tr><th>  Official description </th><th>  <a href="https://buy.garmin.com/shop/shop.do%3FcID%3D142%26pID%3D83274">Forerunner 410</a> / <a href="https://buy.garmin.com/shop/shop.do%3FcID%3D142%26pID%3D84374">Forerunner 610</a> </th><th>  <a href="http://www.adidas.com/ru/micoach/ui/Product/">miCoach</a> </th><th>  <a href="http://nikeplus.nike.com/plus/products/gps_app/">Nike +</a> </th><th>  <a href="http://www.polar.com/en/products/improve_fitness/fitness_crosstraining/FT40">Polar FT40</a> </th></tr><tr><th>  Cost, rub </th><th>  15.635 / 20.885 </th><th>  0 </th><th>  0 </th><th>  9.800 </th></tr><tr><th>  Pulse Monitoring (HRM) </th><th>  In set </th><th>  Bluetooth option HRM, 70-90USD </th><th>  Bluetooth option HRM, 70-90USD </th><th>  In set </th></tr><tr><th>  Data transfer </th><th>  Included Ant + </th><th>  2G / 3G / Wi-Fi </th><th>  2G / 3G / Wi-Fi </th><th>  Option FlowLink, 3300rub </th></tr><tr><th>  Total cost, rub </th><th>  15.635 / 20.885 </th><th>  2500 </th><th>  2500 </th><th>  13.100 </th></tr><tr><th>  Track / Speed ‚Äã‚ÄãMonitoring (GPS) </th><th>  Yes </th><th>  Yes <br>  (GPS phone SG SII) </th><th>  Yes <br>  (GPS phone SG SII) </th><th>  Not </th></tr><tr><th>  Site for collecting and analyzing statistics </th><th>  <a href="http://connect.garmin.com/">Garmin connect</a> </th><th>  <a href="http://community-micoach.adidas.com/">adidas miCoach</a> </th><th>  <a href="http://nikeplus.nike.com/">Nike +</a> </th><th>  <a href="http://www.polarpersonaltrainer.com/">Polar trainer</a> </th></tr><tr><th>  Working hours, <br>  Wait / write h </th><th>  Battery <br>  336/8 672/8 </th><th>  Samsung GSII <br>  710/8 </th><th>  Samsung GSII <br>  710/8 </th><th>  Battery <br>  More than a year </th></tr><tr><th>  Multisport </th><th>  Running / Bicycle </th><th>  Running / Bicycle </th><th>  Running / Bicycle </th><th>  Running / Bicycle </th></tr><tr><th>  Memory </th><th>  1000 workouts </th><th>  16 GB </th><th>  16 GB </th><th>  50 workouts </th></tr><tr><th>  Easy handling </th><th>  4+ </th><th>  3 </th><th>  3 </th><th>  five </th></tr><tr><th>  Special marks </th><th>  Touch control is not always convenient </th><th></th><th>  The most colorful presentation of the results </th><th>  Unable to track distance </th></tr></tbody></table>

    <h4>  <b>Part 1. Fitness and pulse: Polar FT40</b> </h4><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/ae5/98e/cbc/ae598ecbc93d268dc265db5c40e0e3ee.jpg"><br><br>  We start with a standard solution, hammered into the heads of city dwellers, with annoying advertising: a fitness subscription, for standard workouts with barbells and weights.  The lesson is useful, but does not meet the main goal of training - strengthening the heart while maintaining shape.  To track the level of workload from classes, the first device was purchased: Polar FT40 (see table).  After a few months of training, the emphasis from the gym was shifted to a treadmill.  Thanks to the device, I used to collect and monitor the statistics of classes, and with its help it was possible to track the progress in the development of the heart.  The data stored on the site is as follows: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/414/e6d/88c/414e6d88c2eee4693006f225f5f8cdaf.jpg"><br><br>  Kilometer has to be entered manually, since this parameter cannot be measured in the hall.  If you open any workout, you can get detailed information: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/1b7/6be/970/1b76be970db2a04fd8078b9b7480587f.jpg"><br><br>  If you continue classes in the hall - perhaps this is enough, but summer has come, and the legs themselves are carried out into the street - running around the park is much more pleasant than knocking your feet on a treadmill.  Since FT40 does not allow to measure and save the distance traveled, I had to purchase a new device. <br><br><h4>  <b>Part 2. Street and distance: Garmin Forerunner 410/610</b> </h4><br>  Second device: Garmin Forerunner 410 HRM. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/c47/efb/a87/c47efba87b02cc6d3c8cd5353a50b26f.jpg"><br><br>  Characteristics are given in the table, the main thing that was required of him was to save the distance, in addition to what Polar FT40 could do.  Statistics on the site now looks like this: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/61c/3cc/0a0/61c3cc0a00586a4225c4300e38bfa7f1.jpg"><br><br>  I like this presentation more than the first, even if there are weekly totals on the main page.  Exposing a workout provides access to a large amount of data that can be monitored over time: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/49e/941/e87/49e941e877caf194bb96907cac764d80.jpg"><br><br>  If necessary, you can unload accumulated trainings from the site in the .csv / .gpx / .tcx / Google Earth formats, and feed it to any other program for processing and analysis, for example - SportTracks / Endomodo, etc. <br>  The statistics in this case involved me in the running process.  It was very interesting to observe the growth of training volumes, the decrease in the average pulse, the growth of the peak pulse and the rate of overcoming the distance. <br>  Workouts from Connect Garmin, as well as from other applications, can be shared and shared with enthusiastic people who can tell you a lot of things by looking at the proposed statistics.  For example, the training shown in the screenshot is available here: <a href="http://connect.garmin.com/activity/177594810">10 km race</a> <br><br>  With this device, I would have continued training, but I managed to lose it, after which I took a slightly more advanced model Forerunner 610, which is different in touch screen and in size. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/5b1/1be/dac/5b11bedac5a3fb3cce44dbe9e46be6b1.jpg"><br><br><h4>  <b>Part 3. Beautiful and free: applications for the phone Nike +, miCoach</b> </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/468/5fe/1b8/4685fe1b8d4647cd16ec502c4dc55029.jpg"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/727/b9a/8a0/727b9a8a09a17768418835f87357727a.jpg"><br><br>  In the process of training, there are many enthusiastic people and even amateur organizations that run for themselves and promote it with affordable means.  In particular, I joined the Nike Race Club, which offers free training in Moscow parks, with the involvement of professional coaches. <br>  Being engaged together with them, I decided to evaluate the solutions that are available for owners of smartphones equipped with a GPS receiver.  I chose two applications from a huge variety: NikePlus from Nike, and adidas miCoach. <br>  The main objective of both applications is to maintain statistics when passing the distance, as well as to increase motivation in any way possible: by handing virtual prizes, synchronization with the music library, colorful presentation of the saved activities. <br>  Applications look very decent both on the phone screen and on the site, where data is automatically transferred after the workout is completed. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/ee7/b41/684/ee7b416840d4cd36a84fbc3276b0420d.jpg"><br>  Adidas miCoach <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/60f/66f/6b4/60f66f6b47fd0efca854d0d26f583bb6.jpg"><br>  Nike + <br><br>  When choosing a workout, you can also get acquainted with the detailed information, which is similar to that provided for Garmin devices, except for the pulse statistics, I did not have a pulse monitor. <br><br>  I would especially like to mention the motivation system implemented in the Nike + application.  Practically after each workout, the virtual coach will find something to praise, and will hand over another trophy.  For example, just for the fact of going to jog on my birthday, I got this cake: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/8a6/fee/154/8a6fee15499e99bc90bd1c3a4603ac4b.jpg"><br><br>  No matter how naive it looks, but it works, I want to check what the imagination of developers is still capable of in inventing original prizes. <br><br>  Deficiencies of applications (any and all including) <br><ul><li>  less reliability in comparison with specialized devices, sometimes due to failures when launching the application, or at a distance, the training is not saved correctly or is not saved at all; </li><li>  It is difficult to control the speed in the process of training, usually the phone is deep in your pocket; </li><li>  to save pulse data, you need to find and purchase an optional Bluetooth heart rate sensor, for example: <a href="http://www.zephyranywherestore.com/hxm-bt-heart-rate-monitor-for-android-hr-speed-distance/">Zephyr HxM ‚Ñ¢ BT Heart Rate Monitor</a> ; </li></ul><br>  Application Benefits <br><ul><li>  availability, to start using requires only the presence of a smartphone; </li><li>  colorful presentation of results; </li><li>  additional motivation systems, in the form of a reminder of successes and achievements after each workout; </li></ul><br>  For each application, development companies offer a set of external sensors, but without them you can easily do. <br><br>  <b>Bottom line:</b> <b>to maintain physical fitness with the help of running, practically nothing is needed except desire and running shoes.</b>  The weather and the season are not a hindrance, to -15 it is quite comfortable to run, only the right clothes are needed. <br>  <b>Start with a free app, type in statistics and start working on improving results.</b>  <b>To monitor the work of the heart, it is highly desirable to use a pulse sensor, and to control speed and distance, a GPS receiver is needed.</b>  You can purchase a specialized device that is more convenient and accurate during a workout, or buy a pulse sensor for a phone, and go to more advanced paid applications. <br><br>  Of course, each manufacturer has a line of devices with different functionality, and besides those mentioned there are many others.  However, "You can not grasp the immensity," and the article already turned out to be long. <br>  I am ready to comment on all the above, and answer questions on the topic. <br><br>  <b>See you at the distance!</b> <br><br>  <b>UPD1:</b> Nike running club: a project of the Nike company, to popularize the run (well, yourself loved in equipment).  The main project resource: <a href="http://runmoscow.com/training">Nike running club</a> .  I follow training plans through VKontakte.  Trainings take place in Moscow parks: Gorky Park, Sokolniki, Filevsky Park.  In the summer, the main classes were in Gorky Park, now Sokolniki and Filevsky are left.  Conditions are as simple as possible: you come to the stated place.  at the stated time, with a form and desire.  You meet a group of those concerned, and under the strict guidance of a coach - you go to an hour and a half lesson in a pleasant company. <br><br>  <b>UPD 2:</b> As a bonus, I propose to those who love to run with their music - an original resource with music selected by tempo to maintain a given pulse: <a href="http://www.muzkulatu.ru/">Musculature</a> .  Mostly the tracks are paid, but for starters, the Free Demo is enough. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/158169/">https://habr.com/ru/post/158169/</a></p>
