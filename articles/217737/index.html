    <h4>  Introduction </h4><br>  We will look at the gags, crutches, and requirements management system (RMS) rakes in order to understand what I want from requirements management systems.  In the beginning I will make 2 ads. <br>  In one of the announcements of the report, which was previously sent out, it was said that a fundamental review of the PMS would be made.  Review will not.  In fact, there was such an idea: to miss several real-world tasks of the SUT through several systems, but when I took it, I realized that I greatly overestimated my strength (later I will say why).  The good news is that I have where to send you :). <br><br>  Last year, the REQ Labs conference was held in Kiev, where the idea was perfectly realized: analytical fights.  The conference was attended by three experts who, unlike me, know SUT well, because they constantly use them and conduct training.  In the course of the conference, the experts put the real task of working with the requirements, and they demonstrated how this is done in different systems.  Work was proposed with three systems: RequisitePro, Enterprise Architect, Sybase PowerDesigner.  If someone is interested in this question, the video is on the website of the company REQ Labs (http://www.req-labs.ru/conf2012/agenda/530/). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/2ae/65b/198/2ae65b19845659ecee592d8df59bf277.jpg"><br><br>  The second announcement (see screenshot 2 of the presentation) already refers to the announcement that I typed in the program. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/34f/c22/5f3/34fc225f3007bf97d9117454fca57b5e.jpg"><br><br>  Namely, I wrote that analysts are the most oppressed class among IT specialists, because they do not have good tools.  But in the process of writing the report, I realized that analysts, on the contrary, have too many good toys that no one else wants to play.  The problem is this, and it will be discussed now.  I will tell why the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe report arose, and what problem arose before analysts. <br>  I am not a professional analyst.  I was a programmer, then a manager, now my position is called an analyst - and, it turns out, I can say with a clear conscience that I <b><i>became an</i></b> analyst.  But there was a period when I changed jobs once a year.  He worked in three different places.  In one company I worked as a technical director.  The company was small, only five people.  In another company - it was bigger and consisted of thirty people - I was in charge of the direction.  Now I am working on a project to develop a banking system.  And each time the customer (employer) confronted me with the problem of implementing a requirements management system (CTS) and I had to choose which tools to use.  The article is devoted specifically to the topic, what problems I had to face, and the conclusions I reached in the process of this work. <br>  Mostly on projects use such a system: Excel Word, Polarion, Enterprise Architect, TFS, Wiki, Caliber, Jira. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/976/b91/23f/976b9123fd7a034ba351bd60795ef8c7.jpg"><br><br>  Many companies still use the MS Office suite to develop and manage requirements.  In addition, Sharepoint is spreading more and more, since  it allows you to bring some order into the chaos of Office documents, plus there is an opportunity to conduct version control and comparison.  This system makes it possible to organize something similar to the CMS on the basis of existing practices of the company, which they conducted before in Word and Excel.  And plus add to this web interface in which you can program (now, I know, Sharepoint programmers are the most popular and highest paid, and if you did not know, I recommend to study this program just in case).  Consider other systems. <br><br><h4>  Visual modeling tools </h4><br>  Everyone has heard the Sparx Enterprise Architect program, which allows you to simulate anything.  Specialized development tools - IBM Rational RequisitePro, there are others.  These tools are designed specifically for the development of requirements. <br>  There are also teamwork tools - ALM (Application Lifecycle Management).  Now MS TFS (Team Foundation Server) is gaining popularity very actively.  I myself love him very much and work with him constantly.  This is Microsoft‚Äôs development - a management system for ‚Äúeveryone‚Äù in a team, in other words, a team collaboration tool. <br>  Wiki tools are also gaining popularity.  Wiki is usually integrated with task trackers, the most common of which is the Jira system.  I work in a company that uses the Confluence Wiki tool in conjunction with TrackStudio.  There are more options, such as MediaWiki with Bugzilla. <br>  In fact, what of this list is designed to manage the requirements?  To answer this question, you need to answer one more question: what is the difference between development and requirements management. <br><br><h4>  Development or management </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/88c/367/549/88c367549d5b89eab89597e0853e6897.jpg"><br><br>  You've probably heard about CMMI (Capability Maturity Model Integration).  In this model, requirements management refers to the second level, and requirements development - to the third level, i.e.  requirements development is a higher level process corresponding to a more mature process in a company. <br>  In fact, these are generally different processes.  Development is what analysts do (or people who are commonly referred to as analysts).  And management is what managers usually do: the interrelation of requirements with different working artifacts: test cases, tasks, code, etc. In the end, they link everything that the team develops with the requirements.  On their basis, statuses, traces, etc. are tracked. <br>  From my point of view, all these processes are inseparable (although this is not quite so in CMMI).  The problem is that tools are created for analysts to <b>develop</b> requirements, and for the rest of the team - tools for <b>managing</b> requirements.  In an attempt to dock them and problems occur.  Before we move on to analytics, let's define the terms: rake, crutches, gags. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/5dd/6eb/9ab/5dd6eb9ab997c8772ce0c5b0594403a9.jpg"><br><br><h4>  Definitions <br></h4>  What is a rake?  Rakes, I call some elements inherited from other industries, the use of which creates problems.  For example (this example is not very relevant now, but 10 years ago, when all the development was carried out in Word, it was very relevant), some identifier is assigned to the requirements (by means of Word in the text), to which we refer elsewhere, then we change the source text, as a result of which the number changes, and then the whole structure of relations breaks down.  I hope that you do not have such problems. <br>  To date, the databases have coped with this problem: more or less.  We all know that an identifier is assigned differently now.  This case I gave as an example of a rake.  In fact, in other industries such identification is used now: lawyers, accountants, when they draw up an agreement, then an additional agreement to it, which refers to some clause of the agreement.  Or, for example, there is a Law or amendments to the Law, referring to a specific clause to the Law.  It works in the real world, but an attempt to apply it in IT is a transfer of old experience or a rake, on which someone stepped on and stepped on again. <br>  What are crutches?  This is a very common term in IT - backups or temporary solutions.  As an example, any integration of one system with another is a crutch: one system is not capable of solving something, another system cannot do something either, and in order to integrate them, it is necessary to build crutches. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/38f/30f/370/38f30f370f6d85fe62fa7f21be26a205.jpg"><br><br>  What are ‚Äúgags‚Äù?  Gags arise in cases where the program must perform certain actions itself, but shifts these actions to you.  A very common phenomenon.  All usability consists of gags.  There is even an anecdote about the "Uzbek virus." <br><br><blockquote>  Joke.  By e-mail you receive a letter in which it is written: ‚ÄúHello, I am an‚Äú Uzbek virus ‚Äù.  My developer did not have time to finish writing me, so please send me to the entire address book and format the C drive. Thank you. " <br></blockquote><br><br>  Many programs behave this way, but we are just used to it and do not even pay attention to it.  So, I gave the definitions of terms, we continue on the subject. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/069/e9c/b96/069e9cb96d15805a573eba2295b46be2.jpg"><br><br><h4>  How requirements are developed now </h4><br>  I propose to consider an example of a project that I am working on at the moment - this is an internal development project.  I am developing requirements in the Confluence Wiki (after having failed to select a normal tool as part of my research). <br>  For example, I chose a rather primitive old version.  For the developer, I give this page: context as part of the tool use case diagram (so that they understand why this project is being created).  Then the text describes some specific requirements. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/549/3fb/e1a/5493fbe1ac503fb1d4b3bc27501dc6b1.jpg"><br><br>  In this project, a visual panel is developed, with which users can perform certain operations (I indicate those operations that must be implemented).  And further, an interface layout is given - an idea of ‚Äã‚Äãhow it all should look. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/771/b49/213/771b492134a67cf8ec75329d16d57f8b.jpg"><br><br>  Experience has shown that such a page for developers is normal.  They understand that they are making a panel that will look something like this (in the example, not a real interface, but a prototype), the actual requirements, what they should do, and some contextual representations in the form of a diagram are listed. <br>  Of course, the question arises: ‚ÄúIn which program, other than Wiki, can such a presentation be made?‚Äù Word is not much different.  But later you will understand why I chose the Wiki. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/889/3ad/92d/8893ad92d83da86f794ef4499f9b93f1.jpg"><br><br><h4>  Participants in requirements management processes </h4><br>  I drew your attention to the fact that requirements management is a process that affects the interests of the whole team.  You, as an analyst, develop requirements, then these requirements are used by different people.  Depending on the size of the company, the scale of the project, the technology, some of these people may be, some may not, for example, lawyers may appear.  The point is that in the center of the requirements management process are the requirements that the analyst is developing. <br>  Below I will present some wishes on behalf of these people. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e39/0de/192/e390de192b447875e55c8a4caa53f638.jpg"><br><br><h5>  1. The analyst wants to enter requirements in the form of text. </h5><br>  I want to note that not all analysts want to develop requirements in the form of text - in this case, this is my personal preference.  Most text analysts do not like working with text and prefer to work with visual models, especially those who work in Enterprise Architect.  I explain why it is more convenient for me to work in the form of text: in this form it is more convenient for me to work with the team - they understand the context. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/13d/c94/561/13dc945613ca5d8278e25d5bbd4cb2da.jpg"><br><br><h5>  2. The developer wants to understand the context. </h5><br>  All my experience in IT shows that the main problem of programmers is that they do not understand the context of what they are developing.  They sometimes program without regaining consciousness.  For example, there are many programmers in the banking system development project.  They absolutely do not understand what processes are behind this: what‚Äôs the point of accounting, why do we need reports.  They get the installation that you want to add such a code in such a folder and in such a function.  And people work like that for years. <br>  This naturally leads to problems: a lack of understanding of the context of what they are developing leads to a large number of problems, which are rather expensive.  And in order for people to be immersed in this context, they need to be given demands in a form that is understandable to them.  We are kindergarten and schools are taught to work with the text - for all this is the natural way of presenting information. <br><br><h6>  Text or database? <br></h6>  There is an unnatural way of presenting information - this is a database.  It should be noted that SUT appeared only when databases appeared, where you can sort everything out and monitor the life of each element.  But here is a contradiction: people work with texts, and they need to be stored in a database, leading many to mild schizophrenia. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e61/5f7/83f/e615f783f52edd279ab8bbb8d6a7891c.jpg"><br><br>  Therefore, for the most part, the SUTs tend to the textual representation of the SUT, as it is organized in Wiki and Word, since  they work with texts, and professional systems tend to database more often. <br>  What does this lead to?  Suppose I need to add a requirement.  What I‚Äôll tell you now is perceived by many of the listeners as something natural, because they don‚Äôt know any other ways.  When you create a new requirement, you are asked to enter it in the dialog box.  The slide shows a dialog box from Enterprise Architect because it is not text-oriented and can be justified there. <br><br><h6>  Dialog boxes </h6><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ba6/acf/a26/ba6acfa2676fb944ac518cf54546b7af.jpg"><br><br>  The following screenshot from TFS, is different here.  I had a friend who was accustomed to working in Word, who categorically refused to work in the TFS system.  This system allows you to use different design patterns (Scrum, MSF): requirements appear, bugs, change request, etc. In each case, its life cycle. <br>  What's the point?  When a default template is set, there every newly created artifact has the status of proposed.  I don‚Äôt know why it was done, probably from the CMMI point of view, it was necessary.  The bottom line is that when a person adds a new requirement, he needs to re-enter the dialog box and change the status again.  Thus, he comes into a dialogue twice (of course, the template is customized and it can be removed).  The bottom line is that each new element needs to be entered into the dialog box, and some systems still force all attributes to be set with pens - this is a kind of barrier to the introduction of the CMS. <br><br><h5>  3. The analyst does not want to do anything extra <br></h5>  I do not want to enter each paragraph in a separate window (much less repeat the same actions for each of them).  I do not want to manually set all statuses and constantly switch between the mouse and the keyboard (everyone knows the carpal tunnel syndrome).  This all knocks the analyst out of the stream. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/de0/8b6/ae8/de08b6ae86849dad31493db8e500f336.jpg"><br><br>  I hope that the listeners understand what I am talking about.  When you sit and generate a stream from the requirements text, and then: create a window, move it with a mouse, then again, etc.  This is very difficult to work and very tiring.  Therefore, I consider the dialog box system to be one of the examples of plugs when the system transfers its internal device to you: I have a database and save each record separately. <br><br><h5>  4. The analyst wants to include visual models and images in the requirements. <br></h5>  One more example.  I consider visual diagrams to be the most powerful means of presenting requirements.  Without this, it simply does not work. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/129/780/e56/129780e56b3bfc1028804de586b7df0c.jpg"><br><br>  In this case, the example that was given above in my requirements is the mockup user interface layout (developed in the Pencil program). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/dab/fba/fd8/dabfbafd8c35d57163416ce9482db4b9.jpg"><br><br>  The point is that in order to insert a picture with requirements into the Wiki, I have to first export it to some jpg-png-bpm file, etc., and only then insert it there.  And I always still (suddenly someone will have a desire to change something without me) I insert a link to the used tool and a link to the file.  In my experience, no one ever wants to install a program to change a picture.  In fact, such programs are surprisingly many. <br><br><h5>  5. Analyst: I do not want to export models to jpg-png-bmp-etc <br></h5>  He does not want to run his editors with his hands and store the models in separate files. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/cf1/6cf/864/cf16cf8647079c6b8e4a958ab24bc5fe.jpg"><br><br>  And if you work with the Wiki, then you have to insert images in this form.  This is a huge problem.  I do not want as an analyst to do this.  I do not want to run other editors.  I do not understand why this is not implemented in the requirements development environment.  This is perfectly implemented in MS Office, when you draw a diagram in Visio, and then paste it into MS Office, after which you can edit it right there without leaving Word. <br>  In other words, it is a crutch. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/996/4e3/b75/9964e3b7510a3436e19f7af5638fd65a.jpg"><br><br><h5>  6. The analyst is not a programmer and does not want to describe pictures in the form of code. <br></h5>  Another option is interesting for those who develop requirements in the Wiki (Media Wiki, etc.).  For them, the following screenshot will be clear.  These are wiki plugins that allow you to create diagrams as text or as a picture: PlantUML is a simpler plugin and allows you to draw regular diagrams, and GraphViz has a wider purpose, it is possible to draw any diagrams, but the programming language is more complex (similar to assembler).  In fact, it is a very convenient program in terms of presenting information.  You can change your charts without using any external means, moreover, you can track changes (this is theoretically, because practically I have never seen this done). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/fcf/4be/8a0/fcf4be8a01760717304043501382c616.jpg"><br><br>  But I do not want to code, although programmers love this program.  In fact, if the user suddenly wants to change the arrows or move the figures of the users, and others, it will take a lot of time to figure out how to do it.  If you are doing it in the Enterprise Architect program, it‚Äôs easier there, you‚Äôve connected what you need with the arrows and everything, the difference is clear. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/04d/7ad/187/04d7ad187d449d55b88dc121247f93b0.jpg"><br><br>  In general, it can be viewed in different ways.  It can be considered as a gag, because I do not see any problems, why it is impossible to make an editor directly on the web.  It can also be viewed as a crutch, because I want to include images and diagrams in the Wiki, but I have no other means, and I have to use it. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e87/d54/37a/e87d5437acaa130d909a3d04451414ee.jpg"><br><br><h6>  Does anyone remember what OLE is? </h6><br>  When Windows 3.0 or Windows 95 appeared and OLE was promoted by Microsoft precisely as an opportunity to embed one document into another: as I said, we create a diagram in Visio, then paste it into Word and then edit it in Word.  I still do not understand why WEB does not have such a standard.  There is something in Word, something in Flash, but there is no single way.  Do you understand what I am talking about?  You go to a web page and directly on it edit and draw something.  I have high hopes for HTML5, because something has already appeared there before, but again I don‚Äôt understand why it hasn‚Äôt yet become mainstream. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/9a3/6ff/ea5/9a36ffea58668e1ede93b65b7eacd71d.jpg"><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">There is a draw.io service that allows you to do this very conveniently and beautifully, but at the same time the diagrams are stored on their server, you can paste them into your pages, but not in your own. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Perhaps this will change soon. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">That is why now Microsoft Office is so popular - there all these integration problems have been solved for a long time and are convenient, and, in addition, there are many developments.</font></font><br><br><h5><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> 7. The analyst wants to know what has changed in the requirements and models. </font></font></h5><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">We have learned to compare texts more or less.

First you send him versions from different branches, and then requests come in, and you try to understand what he already has.

Its meaning is as follows: instead of, as in TFS, all communications are hammered by hand, communications are shown visually. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/be0/607/f37/be0607f37c7de29aabc585a8efdb9d4c.jpg"><br><br>  <b>9. Conclusions</b> <br>  And finally, the most important thing.  I have presented all of the above about rakes, crutches and plugs from the point of view of analysts, but from my point of view, you need to take the tools of teamwork and attach a human interface for analysts to them.  Then the problem would be solved. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ea9/f8b/04e/ea9f8b04e1de4f73158e12a7f9dcabe4.jpg"><br><br>  Those.  I want a tool for the whole team, but everything is so that everything that has been gained in other toys of analysts is convenient for him.  From my point of view, all the prerequisites for creating such a tool are.  As soon as such a tool appears, he immediately, in my opinion, will receive high popularity.  Maybe they have already appeared, then tell me about them.  (This hut in the screenshot symbolizes the web turned to face the analysts). <br><br>  That's all.  Thank you all. <br><br>  You can meet Gregory at the next <a href="http://analystdays.ru/list.sdf/analystdays/analystdays3/talks">Analyst Days</a> conference in Moscow on May 24. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/217737/">https://habr.com/ru/post/217737/</a></p>
