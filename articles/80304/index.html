  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How Apple Leaks Information</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  On various online resources devoted to Apple, information about new products of the company is constantly coming up - for us this is no longer a rarity.  But, as it turned out, often the company deliberately commits such a leak.  A striking example is the <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748703580904574638630584151614.html">article</a> about the iTablet tablet, published in the WSJ edition this Monday. <br><br>  I liked the <a href="http://www.macobserver.com/tmo/article/how_apple_does_controlled_leaks">article by</a> John Martellaro on the subject of such controlled information leaks by the apple company, and I decided to translate it specifically for my beloved Habr.  :) <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  __________________ <br><br>  Often a company needs to publish this or that information, and to do it informally.  Apple has been doing this for a long time; such a move helps it to preserve the company's reputation as ‚Äúnever distributing information about unreleased devices.‚Äù  I know this because when I worked at Apple as a senior marketing manager, I was repeatedly instructed to make such controlled leaks.

      It goes something like this: from above, they tell me something like: ‚ÄúWe have such and such specific information, and it is necessary that it get into the media.  John, do you have a reliable friend working in a large edition?  If yes, call him / her and talk.  Unobtrusively mention our information and add that it would be nice if it is published.  No email! ‚Äù <br><br>  Communication always takes place either face to face or by telephone.  At the same time never used email.  Thus, if a dispute arises about the insider, there will be no material evidence contradicting the words of one of the parties.  Both sides will be able to plausibly defend their innocence to the leak, declare a misunderstanding.  This protects Apple and edition. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://img2.pict.com/9a/14/b3/2443173/0/islate.jpg" alt="image"></div><br><br>  The iTablet material was published in Wall Street without Walt Mossberg.  in which case he cannot risk his reputation.  Thus, two other WSJ journalists were involved.  Each of them can point the finger at the other and say: ‚ÄúI thought he asked me to take up this article.  Excuse me." <br><br>  Finally, the material was published online late Monday evening, which means no one could say that it was an attempt to influence the stock market. <br><br>  In the end, the necessary information for Apple is published by the large news publication WSJ, but Apple can always say that all this was just a misunderstanding on the part of the editor. <br><br>  Controlled leaks are almost always the solution.  In this case, Apple may have been required to publish information about the tablet earlier, because  they wanted: <br><ul><li>  "Pin up" rebellious partner; </li><li>  see the reaction of people to the price of $ 1000; </li><li>  make panic / confuse a potential rival, about which the company already knows something; </li><li>  to put analysts and other observers on the right track, so that on January 26 (supposedly) a sufficient number of people came to the Apple Event (after all, as is known, Apple hates the empty seats at such events). </li></ul><br><br>  Of course, if Wall Street draws the right conclusions, and Apple shares crawl upwards, as it is, each of the participants will benefit.  But changing stock prices is never the goal.  This is only the most favorable outcome.  And again, the apple company is protected. <br><br>  That's how Apple makes controlled leaks, and yesterday's article in the WSJ is a classic example of this. <br><br>  <b>UPDATE</b> : <br>  Thank you all for the karma, moved to the blog Apple. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/80304/">https://habr.com/ru/post/80304/</a></p>
