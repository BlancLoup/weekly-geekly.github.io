  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Frequently used software on iPad</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Two and a half years ago, I got an iPad Air tablet, which fit perfectly into the workflow. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/9d2/87a/0c4/9d287a0c465ef037ff53c3a9eb340668.png"></div><br>  Gradually, a certain list of applications was formed that make life extremely easy and allow some tasks to be solved faster and easier. <br>  The main task that the tablet solves is to rid me of the need to carry around paper and a heavy laptop in a 52-story building under construction, where part of my work day is going. <br>  Perhaps something from this list will be interesting to users of Geektimes. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h1>  1. Applications for work </h1><br><br><h3>  Microsoft Word </h3><br>  When I bought the tablet, Microsoft's office suite for iOS was free.  There are some uncomfortable moments when using this product, and it would not occur to me to start a new document on it from scratch, but you can fix it quickly.  Pages and products from Google have similar functionality, but I liked Word.  I also use Excel, but also for quick minor edits.

It contains a couple of gigabytes of project documentation in PDF.  You can carry along albums with construction drawings, or you can see everything on the screen.  Of course, data can be kept in the cloud somewhere, but at my current facility it is very bad in many places with cellular communication, and WiFi has not been launched yet.  So, the ability to view local documents makes me happy. <br><br>  You can also make notes and notes at the place, directly to the blueprints with layouts and send to interested parties. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/6d0/0ad/4fd/6d00ad4fd43db17321061ce2e307869a.png"></div><br><h3>  Autocad 360 </h3><br>  Sometimes you have to look at the source codes of the drawings, the Autodesk corporate application for free, copes with the tasks, but asks for registration with them on the site and Internet access.  And pretty slows down.  This is inconvenient, but found nothing better.  At one time I used TurboViewer, but he had even more glitches. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/01e/7aa/a69/01e7aaa69969b591a9fa7bf08bb14095.png"></div><br><h3>  Evernote </h3><br>  Convenient software for notes, checklists, task list and other things for collaboration.  Used it actively to all known events.  Alas, the free tariff plan for two devices ceased to be enough for me, and as a result I came to two applications, which are described below. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/c2f/6f4/85d/c2f6f485d87ee48a06325f0ac4209fec.png"></div><br><h3>  Dropbox paper </h3><br>  After Evernote changed the licensing policy, I came across Paper Dropbox in a very timely manner.  He came under all the conditions I needed: <br><br>  1. The ability to create and edit in a convenient way large lists with checkboxes. <br>  2. Web access and collaboration. <br>  3. If possible, an application for iOS and Android. <br>  4. Free. <br><br>  All these features I use to create a shopping list.  It has several hundred titles, the positions are marked by me and my wife during the week, and then in the store the choice is replaced by a search.  Well, the list order is tied to my usual hypermarket route. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/a37/c1a/9e6/a37c1a9e6cc5ab94717d92b17da74ee4.png"></div><br><h3>  Microsoft OneNote </h3><br>  This is the second product that I began to actively use after giving up Evernote.  I used it before, but now it‚Äôs all the work and personal notes and notes. <br>  And he is incredibly convenient for me during crawls on the object during the acceptance of work and just for control. <br><br>  It is very convenient in one of the notes to record all the comments, attach photos, and after I get down from the tower, send this page as a PDF file to all interested parties by mail.  And synchronization with all devices is also useful. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/e65/518/695/e655186954e3d5a04d828188e90d3d58.png"></div><br><h3>  DocScaner Pro </h3><br>  A very convenient program to take a document and send it as a PDF file by mail (or put it on a dropbox and other clouds), merge several photos into one multipage document, etc.  It seems it used to cost money, but I said it during the promotion period for free. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/abd/dc3/7ea/abddc37eacdd1d8ec4d0caf841b5fc54.png"></div><br><h3>  HDR Photo Camera </h3><br>  For some time I actively used this application for photographing on the object in difficult lighting conditions.  Looks vyrviglazno, but the details are not lost and informative. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/e5f/e56/80a/e5fe5680a08a1c8136a2e7aeccaedc51.jpg"></div><br><h3>  Microsoft photosinth </h3><br>  Unfortunately, I cannot find this application in the App Store, but it is incredibly convenient for shooting spherical panoramas.  It is very convenient when you need to take a close room, for which you do not choose a normal shooting point and it does not fit in the field of view of the lens. <br><br>  Of course, we have not an artistic photo, but a distorted, but no less visual information. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/6de/8f6/684/6de8f6684ed5b46d36b3fd3058de9600.png"></div><br>  Now you can find a lot of analogues.  And in which case, I think, and "Street View" from Google to use.  There is the possibility of shooting 360-degree panoramas, but I still use this application. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"> <a href="https://fotki.yandex.ru/users/max-a-lebedev/view/953569/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/9db/9c1/94a/9db9c194ab1242ea947d2b6208381fe5.jpg"></a> </div><br><h3>  <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/ru/app/fotoredaktor-ot-aviary/id527445936%3Fmt%3D8">Aviary Photo Editor</a> </h3>  Surprisingly, somehow I didn‚Äôt have enough editors in whom you can cover up something on the photo, add text and save.  I found this one, I have been using it for a couple of years. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"> <a href="https://fotki.yandex.ru/users/max-a-lebedev/view/953561/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/3fd/656/9b6/3fd6569b60bbdd0710fc562b7e3f9db5.png"></a> </div><br><h3>  <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/ru/app/icq-videozvonki-i-cat/id302707408%3Fmt%3D8">ICQ</a> </h3><br>  He used this messenger very actively for many years, but then he came to the conclusion that he had more trouble than good and removed. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"> <a href="https://fotki.yandex.ru/users/max-a-lebedev/view/953567/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/635/92e/358/63592e35822c3170e75fbb3a4ddb8b82.png"></a> </div><br><h3>  <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/ru/app/telegram-messenger/id686449807%3Fmt%3D8">Telegram</a> </h3><br>  I caught on for communication within the family, keeping the channel about my vision of Yekaterinburg and for some useful bots. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"> <a href="https://fotki.yandex.ru/users/max-a-lebedev/view/953618/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/15d/382/461/15d3824617351a0caf22ec21ae934e9c.png"></a> </div><br><h3>  The calendar </h3><br>  Complete application on iOS.  I have enough of its capabilities in order not to forget about meetings and events and, most conveniently, it can be linked to the Google account calendar, as well as set up general calendars.  I have two of them: "Family" and "Work."  Both are shared with my wife, so that she is aware of my work plans and, planning family activities, tries to keep them from overlapping. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"> <a href="https://fotki.yandex.ru/next/users/max-a-lebedev/album/229374/view/954982"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/596/0c4/711/5960c47115d9eafb779b7e794aabe1f7.png"></a> </div><br><h3>  Reminders </h3><br>  Again, the standard application from iOS.  It is interesting to me only in terms of binding reminders to the area.  To come somewhere and forget something is about me.  And so very annoying reminders. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"> <a href="https://fotki.yandex.ru/next/users/max-a-lebedev/album/229374/view/954983"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/fbe/c04/320/fbec04320f8450c76ded3926ad73a6bc.jpg"></a> </div><br><h1>  2.

I use extremely rarely for work, these workers are in the cloud, the name of which I will not name, but for personal use I use it to control the computer on which the video surveillance is running. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"> <a href="https://fotki.yandex.ru/next/users/max-a-lebedev/album/229374/view/954985"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/925/5a3/93f/9255a393fb14619a858fc5765f8c349e.jpg"></a> </div><br><h3>  Padgram </h3><br>  Before, I traveled a lot, and now I like to open a card of some dark Tmutarakani and look at the photos from ordinary living people, laid out on instagram.  Instagram only recently allowed to search for photos by geotagging, but I'm already used to Padgram. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"> <a href="https://fotki.yandex.ru/users/max-a-lebedev/view/953573/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/a3b/e5c/709/a3be5c7090bc9aa780b85dcb1bb31982.png"></a> </div><br><h3>  <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/ru/app/snapseed/id439438619%3Fmt%3D8">Snapseed</a> </h3><br>  Another photo editor.

Unfortunately, in my opinion, Forskveyr is losing ground to Facebook, Google and Tripadvizor.  Also, the atmosphere prevailing in the superuser community is a little frustrating (in terms of forskweier, this is someone like moderators). <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"> <a href="https://fotki.yandex.ru/next/users/max-a-lebedev/album/229374/view/954974"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/e8f/7d0/03a/e8f7d003a6d2dd43a2c8608552453e0e.png"></a> </div><br>  <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/ru/app/swarm-by-foursquare/id870161082%3Fmt%3D8">Swarm</a> <br>  Previously, Forskweir was one and indivisible, but then they divided the entities ‚ÄúCheckin‚Äù and ‚ÄúSearch for establishments‚Äù. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"> <a href="https://fotki.yandex.ru/users/max-a-lebedev/view/953576/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/47c/ad2/5af/47cad25af867f65a86f414be7cce2aaa.png"></a> </div><br><h3>  <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/ru/app/vivino-wine-scanner/id414461255%3Fmt%3D8">Vivino</a> </h3><br>  Excellent search engine and wine directory.

The tablet read most of the letters on the current project and a third of the letters written on it. <br><br>  Most of the posts in LJ are also written using a tablet.  I even refused a powerful smartphone after I broke down and bought a cheap Lumia on Windows Phone.  The phone stopped sitting down for a day, and my nerves became more whole.  Now, if WhatsApp could be fully installed on the iPad, then I would have bought the usual push-button Nokia in a metal case, but alas. <br><br>  Choosing a platform is, of course, a matter for everyone, I am sure that software analogues will be found on both Android and Windows Phone. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/398197/">https://habr.com/ru/post/398197/</a></p>
