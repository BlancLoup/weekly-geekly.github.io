      And absolutely every athlete, regardless of how titled he is (even if you are Usain Bolt), each training is performed by a set of special exercises, which is aimed at working out the technique of running.  I repeat, they do it all, from young to old. <br><br>  In business, such things are often neglected. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/647/b18/56e/647b1856e2734c9f952c8d93665cd99e.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Quote from the book "Frank.  Autobiography of Andre Agassi. <br><br>  <i>‚ÄúDad says that if I hit 2500 goals in a day, then in a week it would be 17,500, and by the end of the year - about a million.</i>  <i>Father believes in math.</i>  <i>He says the numbers can't lie.</i>  <i>A child who beat a million balls in a year will become invincible. ‚Äù</i> <br><br>  7-year-old Andre Agassi trained with his father in the backyard of his house.  He had a special tennis gun that served the balls, and he had to learn how to beat them. <br><br>  The same can be shifted for example to the work of sales managers and form a simple recommendation that will increase the skill and, as a result, the sales volume. <br><br>  <b>Example # 1:</b> if the work of a manager is related to active calls, then the rate of calls per day should be taken as a basis. This is a basic and mandatory indicator that none of the managers have the right to neglect.  It does not matter whether he is a novice or a leading manager  It's just that everyone will have their own rate. <br><br>  <b>Example number 2:</b> if the number of sales of a manager depends on how efficiently he maintains his base and does not forget about clients, clearly knows what to talk with the client and what to offer and how to promote it through the sales funnel, then CRM is a prerequisite -Systems and keeping it up to date.  That CRM will prompt and help the manager to sell more and better. Then, as a rule, should be taken as an indicator of the relevance of the database in CRM and the quality of its maintenance.  So that absolutely every manager during the working day would set aside time in order to actualize the situation that occurred during the day.  Plan your next steps, set tasks for tomorrow, etc. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/296586/">https://habr.com/ru/post/296586/</a></p>
