Designing in 3D makes it easier and easier to imagine the work of complex systems and their structure in space. <br><br>  Relevant specialists are very necessary in Russia, so we are opening the 3D School.  The most important thing: the cost of training - <b>$ 12.000</b> .  At the same time there are 15 free places.  Training will be held in English.  Students of the 3D school will be among the first in Russia to introduce 3D solutions and will have access to the expert environment and practice in a leading IT company.

    <h4>  How many places in the school? </h4><br>  There are 15 free places in the competition and paid places for $ 12.000 for the course.  There are already very few vacant paid places, a number of large domestic companies have already sent specialists to us for training. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage3/178/78f/c23/17878fc23ef2bd75c95338fecff2749e.jpg"><br>  <i>Photo from the opening of the School of 3D-solutions EON Reality in Manchester (UK)</i> <br><br><h4>  How to get free? </h4><br>  Apply until September 17 and go through two rounds: remote and full-time.  In the distance tour you need to indicate your skills, answer the question ‚ÄúWhy do you want to become a student of the School of 3D solutions?‚Äù And the main thing is to describe your idea of ‚Äã‚Äãusing 3D in business and the advantages will be a resume and a 3D portfolio.  And all this is in English. <br><br>  On an in-person tour, you will need to have an interview with experts from CROC and EON Reality (also in English) and perform a practical task on 3D. <br><br>  A full-time tour will take place in Moscow on September 25-26, 2013. You can apply for free tuition <a href="http://crocok.ru/for-students/registration/">here</a> . <br><br><h4>  How will the training go? </h4><br>  The course begins in October and lasts for 9 months, of which in total 3 months of theory and 6 months of practice.  The tasks will be real: modeling of industrial facilities (for example, oil rigs), buildings, their engineering systems and interiors, complex high-tech devices (for example, different types of engines), biosystems (for example, the structure of the human body) and so on.  And all this with the smallest detail and the most realistic animation. <br><br>  <b>Here is the program:</b> <br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Program</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><blockquote>  Theoretical knowledge: <br>  In the first trimester, students of the School of 3D solutions will ‚Äúrefresh‚Äù their knowledge and skills in the field of CAD / 3D animation, prepare for work in virtual reality, use of web and media technologies, design activities and development of creative thinking.  All this is necessary for the development of an entrepreneurial way of thinking. <br><br>  Project skills <br>  In the second and third trimesters, students will be engaged in a number of local and global projects in such areas as training based on simulation modeling, sales and marketing, oil and gas, energy, architecture, medicine and tourism. <br><br>  The program also includes: <br>  1.

In the process of learning, it is possible to use the computing power of the ‚Äúcloud‚Äù of CROC.  In addition, students will be able to use the latest 3D visualization systems.  For example, a 3D cube EON Reality, as in the picture above the topic and below: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage3/f1b/257/97c/f1b25797c3da860507a1ad465bf35f56.jpg"><br>  <i>A model of how engineers in two countries simultaneously work on the same task.</i> <br><br>  Here you can also watch the video <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DJTRIIVVXOog">assembly of the cube</a> . <br><br>  There will also be desktop 3D displays: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage3/395/d82/1d2/395d821d21e4588a1cc8c844f59d9ce0.jpg"><br>  <i>EON Ibench Mobile desktop and the process of studying human organs.</i>  <i>"Reality" pictures fascinates!</i> <br><br>  There will also be 3D projectors, interactive stereoscopic displays and many other interesting pieces. <br><br><h4>  Teachers </h4><br>  These are EON Reality experts from the USA, Great Britain and Singapore who are engaged in the direct sale and implementation of the product.  They have both engineering experience with 3D, and experience with Hollywood.  Teachers will be able to talk about all the practical features of communication with customers and, in general, introduce possible nuances and problems that cannot be understood otherwise than having received 10 years of experience. <br><br><h4>  What can be done after release? </h4><br>  Now 3D solutions allow: <br><ul><li>  To study models of the design object (for example, in the case of nuclear power plants: a virtual survey, production control, demonstration of the operation of the units). </li><li>  Configure sales objects (for example, show car interior, changing seat upholstery materials and colors). </li><li>  Lead the development of virtual training bases: this is required at high-risk facilities for practicing actions in emergency situations. </li><li>  Develop 3D content for educational purposes: these are 3D models with the use of which educational programs for universities are created, industry trainings and so on. </li></ul><br>  When issued, the certificate of the KROK'OK training center is issued, as well as the international certificate of EON Reality.  The best students of the 3D School will be able to take part in the competition for the open vacancies of KROK in 3D. <br><br><h4>  Is it true that 3D is very important in serious companies? </h4><br>  Yes, here is an example - an excerpt from the publication of Valery Nimarenko, Doctor of Economics, Director of the NIAEP in the CAD / CAM / CAE Observer magazine No. 6 2011: <br><blockquote>  ‚ÄúThe main source of structured information about the object (in our case, NPP) is the 3D model.  It serves as a central element of a life cycle management system, providing key information for participants in all other processes.  Mastering 3D design is an obligatory competence of an engineering company.  It is the 3D model that makes it possible to form a high-quality project of the object, providing designers with tools for interconnecting technological schemes and spatial layout solutions, tools for resolving design collisions. ‚Äù </blockquote><br><h4>  How to understand what is it about you? </h4><br>  Just look at the open day on September 10 in the School of 3D solutions.  To get a pass, you need to write in advance to <b>info@crocok.ru</b> in free form (the sooner the better, the number of seats is limited).
