We are talking about engineering surveys, be it geology, geodesy, ecology.  Our global task is to study the territory to create a project.  Working in this industry, we are confronted with the word "secret" through a step.  The coordinates are secret, the receiver is secret, climb over the fence is secret, take pictures in the mall is also secret ... <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ca2/91e/3e2/ca291e3e203096a621c52d1d3d543364.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><a name="habracut"></a>

      The most interesting thing is that people who use this word to the right and left, in 99% of cases (often this refers to different ‚Äústructures‚Äù) have no idea what exactly is secret.  In this article we will talk about spatial data, which is often available due to the large number of geographic information services, and their openness. <br><br>  Immediately forced to make a reservation, the article is subjective and my personal opinion on the interpretation of regulatory documents.  Perhaps professional lawyers will add (refute) my point in the comments. <br><br>  There is a whole set of documents restricting access to classified information containing lists of objects, lists of organizations, etc., which, in turn, is closed by a level of secrecy.  Being interested in them does not make much sense, because without admission to a state secret we would never have had the opportunity to familiarize ourselves with it.  Thus, these documents do not apply to us, ordinary citizens. <br><br>  What is guided by and how to understand what to do if, for example, a high-resolution snapshot of a plant comes into our hands?  We have a valid document (if someone disproves me, I will only be happy), namely the <a href="http://www.geodinamika.ru/_userfiles/files/Reference%2520Information/Government/n_01_15_15278.pdf">Letter of the Customs Committee of the Russian Federation of August 11, 1997 N 01-15 / 15278 ‚ÄúOn the control of the movement of cartographic, topographic, aerospace, geodetic and gravimetric materials. "</a> <br>  Answering the first question, we turn to paragraph 10 of the document: Data (content) ... maps ... aerial photography materials ... allowing to determine the purpose or location of a regime object - secretly. <br><br>  The following clause 11 clarifies that not only the image of the object is secret, but also the image of its territory.  Anyone.  So, having a photograph of the plant in our hands, we carefully sign it and bear responsibility.  The problem is that without a signature or object designation, we cannot say that it is - I personally can assume that this is an abstract trend in photography, a work of art.  The snapshot becomes secret from the moment the object is identified. <br><br>  Topographic maps and plans larger than 1: 50,000 are secret (paragraphs 12-14).  In fact, 2 things are secret here: 1. Coordinate systems of 1942 and 1963, 2. Relief.  Working in local coordinate systems is also not a salvation, you need to remember that, for example, in an urban area, any survey with an area of ‚Äã‚Äãmore than 25 km. Sq. Can automatically fall under the neck (ie, 5 to 5 km).  If you have to use some cards, it is better to take care of removing the relief.  Better yet, remove all the frame design and attribute the ‚Äúscheme‚Äù, however amateurish it may sound. <br><br>  Now we will discuss a very interesting clause 15, which classifies the definitions of the coordinates of geodetic points and "geographical objects" in SK42, as well as in any geocentric coordinate systems.  In other words, detecting the contours of any object with a telephone that falls under the definition of ‚Äúgeographic‚Äù - whether it is at least the boundary of a forest, the intersection of roads, etc., can be brought to responsibility.  It should be borne in mind that UTM (WGS84), which is widely used in household navigators, is just a geocentric coordinate system.  What to do?  First, if possible, use local coordinate systems (well, or invent one‚Äôs own), second, do not sign objects, call them simply as points, and third, remember that absolute positioning accuracy in GPS is a value that is hardly predictable and hard to estimate, depending on the whole set factors.  To understand and estimate that a point is determined more precisely than 30 meters, it is technically possible only if there are coordinates on this point, measured from another solid point defined in WGS84.  (they are very, very rarely for geographic objects, and very rarely for points of the GHS). <br><br>  The points about the catalogs of coordinates are not interesting to discuss - they are secret - I want to immediately refer to p.21.  This point just inspired me to write this article in the aspect of launching a new satellite Resurs-P, with a stated pixel size of a panchromatic image from 0.7 m. <br><br>  I will quote it in full: <br>  <i>21. Primary and derivative materials of aerial photography, except for photoplans and photomaps, with a ground resolution better than 2 meters of 1: 50,000 scale and larger, primary and derivative materials of special types of aerial surveys (television, infrared, microwave, radar, etc.) with a resolution on the ground better than 2 meters of any scale, covering an area in a single array to undeveloped and sparsely constructed areas of more than 5,000 square meters.</i>  <i>km, to cities and towns of more than 75 square meters.</i>  <i>km - secret.</i> <br><br>  What is important here is that the pictures are secret only in relation to the area covered.  If 75 sq. Km of building gets into the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe picture, this is secret.  The territory of Moscow is about 1000 square kilometers.  On the verge of secret / unclassified, just one district of the city (this is the question of why Los Angeles areas are shown as samples of Resurs-P products).  If you upload pictures from Google to your phone, it is better, just in case, to calculate the size of such a snapshot. <br><br>  It is also worth remembering that the materials that do not meet the requirements of the above points, also do not have an open format, and often bear the heading "chipboard".  Those.  the documents are not secret, but a priori belong to some organization, therefore they cannot be used by an individual.  This is described in Appendix 3, which even sports orientation maps provides a stamp. <br><br>  The question is - how do Yandex maps work then?  I do not know, most likely, all products undergo the MO examination procedure and receive a conclusion about the absence of information containing a state secret.  This is a question for Yandex. <br><br>  A few years ago, Roscartography was about to release a document that partially lifted the above limitations.  They say he went under the "secret".  What he took off, nobody knows, and it is impossible to use it.  It remains to remember what I wrote above, and to have this letter at hand to check whether it is worth storing such data or not. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/185648/">https://habr.com/ru/post/185648/</a></p>
