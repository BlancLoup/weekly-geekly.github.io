I decided on the functionality - I want Full NoFrost, so as not to defrost, and so that there are no droplets on the wall of the refrigerator.  I went to search the sites of our retailers.  But, unfortunately, finding the right was quite difficult. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Let's start with the beloved <a href="http://www.mvideo.ru/">"M-Video"</a> .  I don‚Äôt know what, but I like this network, and first of all I look at them. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c9e/e6c/f03/c9ee6cf032164259bfb4ac82631def63.png" alt="image"><br>  We go.  Choosing Kursk, we remember that a refrigerator is a household appliance, and in the household appliances section we find refrigerators.  Initially, all refrigerators are displayed.  Sort by name and price.  There are also groups: by manufacturers, by format and size, and by price ranges. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/cf3/808/96c/cf380896c84490c83ad44ebd409b3f44.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Such an important parameter as the type of the refrigerator and freezer does not appear anywhere.  And I have no idea how big the Full NoFrost refrigerators are, who produces them, and also how much they can cost.  Although in the brief description of the goods, these data are immediately written, thanks for that.

      <br>
      Well, they didn‚Äôt think about me;  The pick up button by parameters is in one of the listed groups on the right, namely in the group under the beautiful name ‚ÄúGroups‚Äù.  Click the mouse and we are searching by parameters. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/8f7/b89/054/8f7b890547461ab5d0dc152916de620c.png" alt="image"><br><br>  First, it is not clear if I need to select ‚ÄúAll‚Äù in each parameter if I don‚Äôt know what parameter value I need.  It turned out not to be, and by default everyone is searched.  Although for clarity, the ‚ÄúAll‚Äù menu item in each of the parameters should be selected and there would be no questions.  So.  Parameters are less grouped.  We find familiar words No Frost.  The parameters are called ‚ÄúDimmer chambers‚Äù and ‚ÄúDim.  cold.  cameras. "  I understand that there was a type of defrost.  Why was to shorten the name, although the place allows, I did not understand.  In addition, the notation is obscure, but the words of salvation No Frost helped me out, without them I would have been thinking for a long time where to look for the type of refrigerator I needed. <br><br>  We choose the parameters I need in two places, we shake down and then there are 2 buttons ‚ÄúPick up‚Äù and ‚ÄúAdvanced search‚Äù. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/443/830/bd7/443830bd72d01e0370860e6da8428963.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Excuse me, but this betrayed what?  Button "Pick up" in red, click it.  (In the advanced search, there are a lot of parameters that can be selected. Why this button was put there is not clear. It was enough to make the Basic / Advanced selector at the beginning of the search and give a list of parameters, and the pick button would be one. Well, okay).  I opened a list of refrigerators, sorted incomprehensibly by what principle (by date of receipt?). <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/675/889/fa3/675889fa399b6eb8f95b9fcb3dde549e.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Click "sort by price" and voila.  More or less a normal list of refrigerators on our screen.  Complicated?  Not so easy. <br>  Let's see what the competitors have. <br><br>  The <a href="http://www.tehnosila.ru/">Technosila</a> website was made by Lebedev Studio.  Well, surely everything should be comfortable here.  Open up. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/aa0/ef6/299/aa0ef629952016e20364932bac89c0a3.png" alt="image"><br><br>  The first thing we choose a city.  There is no Kursk at once, but there is ‚ÄúOther Cities‚Äù.  We look there - there is. <br><br>  Now we are looking for a section.  There are no refrigerators at once, although TVs, for example, are a separate item. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/728/dc1/aeb/728dc1aebf1a0aeaf3e3418e13364543.png" alt="image"><br><br>  We think where there can be refrigerators in "Household Appliances" or "Kitchen Appliances".  Guided by experience, I shake "household".  And I am right - there are no refrigerators in the kitchen. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/5d2/3d5/c29/5d23d5c298a9106f0dc239d278c56f98.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  In the proposed list, I choose ‚ÄúRefrigeration Equipment‚Äù, then we are forced to make a choice between refrigerators, some side-by-side and freezers. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/8e0/08e/92c/8e008e92c11fc630e8f114aea4e8c16c.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Side-by-side are double-wing refrigerators.  Why they were allocated in a separate group is not clear.  But we came for refrigerators.  We look. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/915/054/0c2/9150540c27b0baa13b90fe244943ce8c.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Here is a list for you.  Sort by manufacturer, by popularity and price.  Initially in popularity.  Thank.  Although, for example, you can not choose the popular and cheap. <br>  What's next?  In the brief descriptions not a word about No Frost.  "Cloth" is quite large, a lot of refrigerators.  It is difficult to choose. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c7e/8cd/9be/c7e8cd9be7719557b730bae861a51b41.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Search by parameters no.  The only way to find out if the No Frost system is in the fridge is to open each one and watch.  By experience, we look expensive refrigerators.  Among them, more likely to hit the right.  Dialing the ‚ÄúNo Frost‚Äù search bar does not help.  Refrigerators are not located.  There is nothing at all.  Sadly  Finding the refrigerator I need here is quite problematic.  With regret we go to the next "friend". <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/cbb/87d/105/cbb87d105c4cad40a96fa50ac7232294.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The <a href="http://www.eldorado.ru/">Eldorado</a> website is the only one who remembered my location from the last time, for which I thank him very much.  Although for the first time I need to know or remember which federal district I am in to find my area.  Not very convenient, I think. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/40e/fe9/6cb/40efe96cb854b8239028354b6d8313c3.png" alt="image"><br><br>  The search at the top of the page always scared me.  We will not look, but choose "Household appliances", and in it refrigerators.  List sorted by popularity before your eyes. <br>  There is also a sorting by price and alphabet for some reason.  On the left selector our offers, manufacturer, price ranges, type, location of the freezer and other parameters. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/98e/2ec/f11/98e2ecf11aa2c781fd1e376b3607ccb8.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Among them there is a defrosting system.  Just the right No Frost.  We immediately see that there are 31 such refrigerators.  In the advanced mode, you can choose not one, but several parameters, which will certainly seem convenient to someone.  We are interested in one.  And here it is - our list of refrigerators. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/680/236/b73/680236b73f13458d311a28e5f8092e38.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The feds are all complicated.  Maybe local craftsmen tried?  I remember right away that we have Rosformat and Techno stores.  Visit them and try to find what you need. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/dc9/a4c/100/dc9a4c100e3c806c3ccbce4ba27abcc2.png" alt="image"><br><br>  In <a href="http://rosformat.ru/">Rosformata,</a> by analogy with previous experience, we turn to household appliances.  Then you need to understand the large you need appliances or small.  I wonder what about?  And if I am looking for a small refrigerator, where will it be?  We go to the large.  I have seen refrigerators and I know that they are rather big ones.  Similarly, there are relatives here. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/bf8/a34/521/bf8a34521a46348e32a852ea8a40a2bc.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The list is extensive.  Sort by price, alphabet and manufacturer.  The defrost function is not described in the brief annotations.  Look for No Frost search.  Alas, nothing found. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/51d/73c/a8b/51d73ca8ba2e1bcfb6e4bcbb566896fd.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  On the website of <a href="http://tehnokursk.ru/">Techno</a> stores <a href="http://tehnokursk.ru/">, the</a> category of refrigerators is immediately visible, which is definitely a plus. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f40/0a2/308/f400a230843e51be32c9b852e8f43127.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Do I find here what I need quickly and easily?  Alas.  A list of General Frost refrigerators was opened, sorting first by manufacturers, then by date of receipt, update (what is this?), Price, name, article number (by whom is it known?). <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/0b6/386/423/0b63864239ebc048041854439b8bc032.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Very strange.  But there is a search.  Enter "No Frost" and, lo and behold!  The list of refrigerators in the description of which this phrase is written before my eyes.  But, descriptions of refrigerators are very inconvenient.  Everything is crumpled.  Sort search results at least for the price there.  Also displayed as a model with a system of No Frost in both cameras, and in one of the cameras.  But already some result.  Fortunately a list of two pages in total. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/077/6ab/35e/0776ab35e7e61ae1b5119e470d81a890.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  What conclusions can be drawn from this?  Firstly, it is unlikely that I was not ‚Äúlucky,‚Äù and I was looking for a refrigerator for such a complex parameter as the defrosting system.  I found out about this parameter on one of the sites about the choice of the refrigerator and preferred No Frost.  Agree, an important parameter for choosing a refrigerator.  Most likely, if I searched for a different parameter, the search would be no less thorny. <br><br>  Secondly, it is not always easy to find the necessary section, you need to think a lot and make extra mouse movements.  And not always people will choose their city before looking for something, and finding the right, they will be disappointed that it can only be bought in another city. <br><br>  Thirdly, I did not mention that it is not always what is and like to eat in stock.  Sometimes these are display cases, and sometimes they are simply not there.  It is not always possible to find out about availability, and not quite trivial.  But that's another story. <br><br>  This is not all household appliance stores that we have in the city, but I remembered them in the first place.  Perhaps somewhere the search for goods is better implemented. <br>  I leave the evaluation of the convenience of the presented interfaces to your judgment. <br><br><h6>  PS Advise a good fridge with a system No Frost 25,000 - 30,000 rubles, which can be bought or ordered in Kursk. </h6></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/103053/">https://habr.com/ru/post/103053/</a></p>
