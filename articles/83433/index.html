      Let's virtually observe from the side of such successful and try to highlight some of the features of easy communication. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  As a rule, such a person <b>smiles</b> !  A smile is an expression of location, such a small gift for nothing (remember, as in the cartoon ‚ÄúJust like that!‚Äù).  And people love when they give something, free of charge, just like that!  By the way, that is why, when they first got abroad (to developed countries), people are so enthusiastic about the atmosphere there.  Like, everyone is smiling, not that we have - completely cattle!  I have often been abroad and I will say this: if in our country people are smiling, this can be believed, it is usually sincere!  What can not be said about many and many foreigners with a ‚Äúglued‚Äù smile, which they isolate from the world.  Do not get caught. <br><br>  For such people, the <b>problem does not look so terrible</b> .  Solved :) They are not loaded internally with 99% of the CPU.  This is a fact: most of the current problems are solved. <br><br>  But we note another feature: they <b>solve it</b> !  Do not engage in "brain masturbation" days / months / years, and take and do.  Such a determination.  They also infect interlocutors with this confidence that everything is solved.  And not so difficult. <br><br>  It may seem from the outside that successful people in communication are superficial.  In fact, they just have a great positive experience, so they are confident.  <b>Confidence</b> , here's another trait. <br><br>  And now the exercises that will allow you to <b>develop</b> communication skills: <br><br>  1. <b>Smile</b> !  Smile more often, just like that, for no particular reason.  In our society, it is customary to show frustration, discontent, and grumble.  Therefore, a smiling person is like a breath of fresh air!  It is pleasant to look at such people.  Strangely enough, but the fact of a smile already improves mood, so if it is very hard, depression suffocates, try to smile in front of the mirror, at least through force! <br><br>  2. <b>Do not be afraid to give</b> !  Forces, skills, knowledge, mood, love, money.  Giving back a hundredfold!  Remember the allegory about the spring and the swamp?  Can you come and give the old woman 1000r just like that?  Not the best, grumpy, unhappy old woman in the store?  And wish her strength and joy?  Only sincerely! <br><br>  3. <b>Act</b> !  It gives energy: a person draws strength in striving for the best.  If the desire is supported by real steps in a bright future - it inspires!  And not only you, but also those around you are pushing for feats that would seem to them not peculiar :) Buy 10kg of excellent tangerines for your department and please everyone.  Just! <br><br>  I wish you good luck and strength on this path! <br><br>  PS ‚ÄúKing-Eagle‚Äù already mastered?  Here you have a nice simple patter on the ability to think in the process of speaking: <br><br>  "On the ground we lazily burbot caught <br>  Aground we caught tench <br>  Oh love not you cute you prayed <br>  And in the mist Estuary beckoned me " </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/83433/">https://habr.com/ru/post/83433/</a></p>
