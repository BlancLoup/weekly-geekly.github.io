But the same device is offered to Foxconn and other brands for regional sales.  Foxconn itself does not plan to sell the platform on its own behalf, limiting itself to OEM production for customers such as CSL. <br><br>  For example, a similar device called the Olivepad VT100 was intended to start selling in the summer by the Olive company in India, and under the name <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/netbook/103216/">Viewsonic Viewpad 7</a> it may appear on the European market. <br><br>  However, CSL Spice M700, in contrast to those listed, is already sold freely. <br><br>  Since I am now on business in Kuala Lumpur, the capital of Malaysia, I had the opportunity recently to twist this device "live" and get a direct impression. <br><br>  I really liked the high quality of workmanship, this is not a rootless Chinese vendors "from alibaba", there are also some here, I took them for comparison.  Well, what to say.  "Penny" is also a machine, in certain conditions.  :) <br>  I myself was for a short time the owner of SmartQ V, which, fortunately, managed to get rid of a good discount (I hope the new owner liked it more than me), and decided not to get involved with ‚ÄúChinese iPads‚Äù in any form.  However, this is another matter. <br><br>  "You take in hand - you ma'am thing!" <br><br>  The tablet is made in a very nice ‚ÄúiPhone 4 style‚Äù (I don‚Äôt mean ‚Äúone button‚Äù, which is already starting to get, as in its time, ‚Äútranslucent mice‚Äù that were copied by all ‚ÄúChina‚Äù), that is, light, metallic to the touch frame with pronounced "edges" on the perimeter, and a smooth black "glass" from the "face" and "rear". <br>  Aesthetically, it looks very nice, even talking funny about any ‚Äúbacklashes and squeaks‚Äù.  Thing. <br><br>  Right - the conclusion of the dynamics.  Hole above - phase inverter.  Joke. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/1a5/132/f3d/1a5132f3d8f2a217a144dbf09ebd47c4.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Below on the right is a microUSB, a headphone jack (3.5 ") or a bundled wired headset, a built-in microphone and a cutting hole. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/aac/587/0fd/aac5870fdd823315ac965d576fad32bf.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Above - two buttons and a lockable flap with slots for SIM and microSD. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/d94/d33/8b7/d94d338b776d255e70cfca0d4f5454c2.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  On the left - the second speaker and the power button. <img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/0b7/4d8/53b/0b74d853b79eb7ff48329bc723e3558c.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Inside already familiar Android 2.2 Froyo, and the Android Market is present. <br>  Despite the fact that the ‚Äúfrequencies‚Äù of the processor seem to be low, everything works without visible brakes, everything scrolls, scrolls and ‚Äúmultitasks‚Äù without any brakes in the interface, which is most striking in contrast to the ‚ÄúChinese iPads‚Äù, which have really trouble <br><br>  There is Mobile Tethering (in the store through a demo pad and its 3G HSDPA local distribution of the Internet is launched;).  The bundled software gives Document to Go and GPS software MapKing (a detailed map for Malaysia, maybe there are others, not watched).  And of course the standard set of GMail, Google Maps, Youtube App, and so on.  Since Malaysia is a Muslim country, the set includes programs for targeting Mecca (using the built-in compass) and an ‚Äúalarm clock‚Äù with time synchronization for daily traditional prayer. <br><br>  <a href="http://www.csl.my/index.php/products/mobile-phone/m-series/item/118-spice-mi700-droidpad">The official page on the site CSL.</a> <br><br>  A matte film is regularly pasted on the screen, which does not glare, and on which fingerprints are not left (hello, ipad!), It comes with a convenient case in the form of a folder with a tablet holder. <br><br>  From the control on the ‚Äúface‚Äù on the right, there are 4 sensory ‚Äúareas‚Äù (back, menu, and so on), pressing on which is marked with a short vibration signal, plus two ‚Äúhardware‚Äù buttons on the top. <br><br>  The sale began in September, and there are already <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DfUO1x4TJShQ">several videos</a> on Youtube, including the traditional <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DmlUyQ2SURS0">‚Äúunboxing‚Äù</a> , a story about a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DE3s6d30zlPQ">set of software</a> and a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DC5Ps6h3CyGI">demonstration</a> of the interface. <br><br>  Price: 1599 RM (Malaysian ringgit), which roughly corresponds to 515 USD at the current rate, which is pretty good for such a device, in such a rich "configuration".  With such a device, it is already possible, if desired, to align the iPad. <br><br>  Briefly: Screen 7 "vs. 9.8" on the iPad, respectively, less resolution (800x480 vs. 1024x768).  Processor 600MHz ARM9-family vs. 1GHz ARM11-family. <br><br>  Next: 3G in the database.  You can call as on a regular phone.  There is a full microSD expansion slot, the storage capacity of the device can be expanded by the user.  Two cameras, one VGA with a ‚Äúface‚Äù for 3G video calling and Skype.  Includes matte film on the screen and cover.  A regular SIM is used instead of microSIM.  Lighter, almost double (410 grams versus 730).  Cheaper. <br><br>  If any questions are not covered - I can answer interested, as long as there is an opportunity to "twist". </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/107201/">https://habr.com/ru/post/107201/</a></p>
