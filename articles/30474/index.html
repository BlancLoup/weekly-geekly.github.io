      <strong>Firstly</strong> , the definition of people under the age of 18 years falls under the EXTRA category of citizens who are STUDENTS of the first, and sometimes the second year in higher education. <br><br>  <strong>Secondly</strong> , during school hours, many high school students are forced to go to tutors, and high school students often go to various kinds of circles and sections, and because of the "wonderful" work of the transport network of our city, especially in winter, sometimes physically CANNOT get home to these notorious 22 o'clock in the evening! <br><br>  <strong>Thirdly,</strong> with regard to resort towns - generally a separate song.  A HUGE number of children on the embankment in an hour, two, three nights, nobody was ever surprised there, and the police officers working for the ‚Äútick‚Äù in terms of the floor count of the ‚Äúcaught‚Äù children will seize the first people.  And then their parents will headlong search for children in police stations, located not in the center of the city.  (I judge by the example of Gelendzhik, and the words about the "tick" are not taken from the ceiling, but from the words of former employees of the department for not adult matters) <br><img src="http://k23.ru/uploads/posts/2008-05/1210521105_1.jpg" width="338" height="450" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="right"><br>  <strong>Fourth</strong> , measures aimed at combating homelessness, according to Galina Zolena, will not lead to its decline, since  in the ‚Äúback streets‚Äù and dark ‚Äúdistant courtyards‚Äù, and most importantly the ‚Äúentrances‚Äù, the police will not go looking for teenagers for sure.  And all those drug addicts, juvenile drinkers, and juvenile offenders, as they were there, will be like that. <br><br>  But I bet, a completely honest and law-abiding young man, who only turned eighteen after half a year, will surely be delayed if I go already at 22:01, since  right next to my high-rise building with incomprehensible goals, a car with four militiamen armed with AUTOMATIC SYSTEMS is on duty all day long. <br><br>  <strong>And what do we have in the dry residue?</strong> <br><br>  In the agricultural region, the rise in prices for food produced here is higher than in Moscow or St. Petersburg, there are eternal traffic jams in the cities, garbage is often not taken out, housing and communal services do not work, the fight against apartment swindlers is not conducted, in parks in broad daylight they are killing, but our wonderful government cannot already invent what kind of durat law to adopt! <br><br>  <strong>Well, the main issue for discussion: a</strong> passport, issued at 14 years old, taken to the army from September, even if there is NO 18 years old, and the right to be on the street only from 18 years old, why so, why a person does not get all his rights at once with getting a passport? </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/30474/">https://habr.com/ru/post/30474/</a></p>
