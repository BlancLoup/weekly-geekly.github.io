Internet becomes dulled by children</i> " ¬© Bash.org.ru <br><br><hr><br>  We, habrareyi, are witnessing a unique event - <s>a</s> generation of children <s>born</s> before our eyes, who are accompanied from the cradle by a terrible beast named the Internet.  His gifts are indisputable, but let's forget about them for a minute and look at how such a fertile soil affects the flowers of our life. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  So.  Imagine the average student.  He is from 12 to 18 years old, and he spends all his free time at the computer.  The main activities are games, chatting in various chat rooms, forums and classmates.  Moreover, the words ‚ÄúIschu,‚Äù ‚ÄúI want,‚Äù and ‚ÄúIscho‚Äù, which became the classics, often and completely skip.  At the same time, as I was convinced, this is not ‚Äúpadonkaffsky‚Äù slang - people just write like that.  Just yesterday I met with my teacher of the Russian language at school, and she said that the average level of "literacy" for some five years had fallen by half.  And this means that where the average student used to make 9 mistakes, now he makes 18. What is the reason - let's see. <br><br>  Let's start in order.  Network communication itself is ‚Äúread-write‚Äù.  When there was no computer, even the laziest idler learned to read books, even if these books were ‚Äúfirst, blue and ABC,‚Äù but in any case, these books were <b>literate</b> and without errors.  And no matter how the brain of the young idiot resisted, the visual memory took its own. <br>  Now, communication with books has been successfully replaced by communication with their own kind.  It would seem - nothing criminal.  Spending hours in chat rooms or blogs@mail.ru, which have already become the talk of the town, the children work out the ‚Äúread-write‚Äù mechanism on their own replicas.  And these replicas are not written from the spelling dictionary, but from the head.  In addition, the majority still "do not bother" to write correctly and write the same way as they say.  Well, we always have enough fools, God bless them.  But such a replica becomes another simulator for the ‚Äúread-write‚Äù mechanism for other children, whether they want it or not - you will not be fooled by visual memory. <br>  If a person tends to write correctly, which in itself is commendable, but cannot open a dictionary (either laziness, or he does not have a dictionary at hand, or he does not know about the possibility of the Internet), then he starts trying to think logically.  And here is included such an algorithm of thinking, which, in order not to seem illiterate, all the unstressed vowels are changed to those with which they are confused (‚Äúand‚Äù to ‚Äúe‚Äù, ‚Äúo‚Äù to ‚Äúa‚Äù - ‚ÄúSorry‚Äù), hissing sounds in general disfigures according to the law unknown to science (‚Äúltshe‚Äù), drags the unpredictable letters from where it comes from (‚Äúdangerous‚Äù), and, as a result, an even more delusional syntax is obtained than in the first case.  But the most annoying - the child <b>believes</b> that this is the correct spelling.  And with a sense of accomplishment, it fixes it in his memory.  And so many times.  The number of errors is multiplied by the number of replicas, then multiplied by the number of readings ... You can imagine what will be in his head after three or four years of honing such spelling.

      Unfortunately, I myself notice that the more time I spend on the Internet, the more I lose in literacy.  True, in my case, punctuation is sacrificed - the brain in this insane "race for time" simply throws out all sorts of commas from the writing, as if they do not carry a special meaning.  Nevertheless, I still try to read books, I am grateful to online libraries - I read with them much more than if I used only "paper media". <br><br>  But who will protect our children?  And most importantly - How?  I do not know the answer to this question yet. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/37283/">https://habr.com/ru/post/37283/</a></p>
