There is an acute shortage of young, talented and ambitious mobile developers on the market, so for the second year in a row, we are conducting free <a href="http://developerstudyjams.com/">Android StudyJams</a> courses for those who want to get acquainted with Android development.  The educational program, which covers more than 300 cities around the world, is supported by the Google Developers Group community. <br><br>  If last year you missed this event, then today each of you has a chance to participate in free courses on developing mobile applications for the Android platform. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h1>  <font color="#2196F3">StudyJams 2015 and work on the bugs</font> </h1><br>  Last year, courses were held only in Moscow, but even so, more than 500 applications for participation were submitted.  As a result, we selected about 70 people, 15 of them successfully defended their final projects and received certificates.

      The 2015 course was based on <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/developing-android-apps--ud853">this Udacity program</a> .  Unfortunately, newcomers rated it as difficult and too big.  In part, they are right: this course covers a wide range of different aspects of development, including those that you don‚Äôt need to know at the initial stages of Android programming.  In addition, the course itself required quite a lot of knowledge at the start: students needed Java, an understanding of OOP, and experience in working with SQL. <br><br>  Given the excitement around the training program, we decided to take into account last year‚Äôs experience and expand the program to include the main geographical areas from which applications came. <br><br>  In 2016, Android StudyJams will be held in as many as nine cities in Russia: Vladivostok, Voronezh, Yekaterinburg, Kazan, Moscow, Nizhny Novgorod, Omsk, Perm and Rostov-On-Don! <br><br>  <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/android-development-for-beginners--ud837">The course of this year is</a> much simpler: it is designed for people who are new to Java for the first time, for whom the words ‚Äúpolymorphism‚Äù, ‚Äúinheritance‚Äù, and ‚Äúencapsulation‚Äù mean nothing.  However, for one day offline course in your city and a couple of weeks of diligent online classes, you can create your own application for ordering coffee!  Or by calculating the trajectory and time of the appearance of the ISS in the night sky.  Or something else interesting, would be enough imagination and perseverance. <br><br>  Also, this course can be useful for web developers who have decided to master the world of mobile development: modern patterns, development tools and universal unification will allow applying the already existing knowledge base to writing Android applications. <br><br><h1>  <font color="#2196F3">What is required of the student?</font> </h1><br>  The Android development professionals will help you master the course materials: active GDG members and experienced developers from various Russian companies. <br><br>  In the new program, we tried to cover most of the aspects of mobile development, reduce the complexity and make the courses more versatile than last year.  At the same time, Android StudyJams is still demanding that the learner assiduity and readiness to intensively disassemble a new material, but believe me, it's worth it! <br><br>  Having successfully completed the training course, you will be able to create mobile applications for solving a huge number of tasks: from a calculator for the trajectory of ballistic missiles to your social network (which will be 100% defeated on Facebook: D).  As a nice bonus for completing all stages of the online course and listening to the course offline, you will receive the appropriate certificate, which you can brag to the employer. <br><br>  Requirements for students are simple: knowledge of the English language at least at the level of reading technical documentation, the desire to get acquainted with the development of mobile applications.  And, of course, the experience of owning a modern smartphone is desirable, even though in 2016 it is difficult to find a person who is interested in development and does not have smart devices. <br><br><h1>  <font color="#2196F3">check in</font> </h1><br>  We would love to teach everyone, but the vile laws of physics do not allow us to accept an infinite number of students in one room, so we had to limit the number of students.  So if you are eager to master the writing of programs for the OS Android - hurry to enroll in courses, while there are free places.  We will review your application and send an email with additional information.
