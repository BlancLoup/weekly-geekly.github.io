If you have no idea about site building, there are many companies that will help create a business card site for a fee.  You can also create a website yourself on a free hosting with the help of an online designer. <br>  There are many video tutorials on website creation on the Internet, and within a few hours, you can create your first saytik.  It is quite suitable for a young company.  But, if you are set up for the rapid promotion of products or services, we advise you to develop a high-quality website with your domain name, unique design, easy navigation and high-quality content.  Yes, it will be expensive, but over time it will help you earn a lot more than was spent. <br>  The site is created.  Now you need to bring traffic to it.  Consider the main channels that will help us in this. <br><br>  <b>1. <u>Email Marketing</u></b> <br><br>  This is the most effective method of promotion based on the survey of marketers above.  It is universal, as it not only advertises the goods in an email, but also helps to bring traffic to the site, blog, social networks. <br><br>  First, you need to find a suitable mailing service based on the price-quality criterion.  Pay attention to the free features of servers: test drive, special offers, ready-made templates. <br><br>  Email marketing does not require large cash costs and can be automated.  All you need to do is prepare the text and set the date and time of sending the letters in the list scheduler. <br><br>  <b>Types of email letters to promote the product / service:</b> <br><br><ul><li>  <b><i>Letters with the presentation of a new product or new collection</i></b> </li></ul><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/964/dea/9a8/964dea9a8fe1456a88fded07124a647e.png"><br><br><ul><li>  <b><i>Letters of discounts, promotions, sales</i></b> </li></ul><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/70e/e62/787/70ee62787ca449e4b24ce46c4808f8d9.png"><br><br><ul><li>  <b><i>Newsletters</i></b> are digests where links are made to interesting articles related to your work.  In the newsletter you can add photos of products, as well as mention it in articles. </li></ul><br><br>  Do not forget to add social network buttons to each email. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/407/eca/7a8/407eca7a8e1d4a4a886dd7282c4b44d2.png"><br><br>  <b>2. <u>Social networks</u></b> <br><br>  Social networks are primarily a collection of a lively audience that likes not only to communicate, but also to make purchases.  The most <a href="http://adindex.ru/publication/analitics/2015/06/24/125051.phtml">popular social networks</a> among Russian-speaking audience are: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b7e/fef/6f3/b7efef6f35f84844ab7102d41eec14ce.png"><br><br>  The basic rules for promoting your business in social networks: <br><br><ul><li>  Creating your own group, community or page; </li><li>  Attracting an audience to it using a website or mailing (adding social networking buttons); </li><li>  Publishing useful content; </li><li>  Continuous updating of group materials; </li><li>  Organization of contests, the winners of which will receive a discount on your product or the opportunity to test it for free; </li><li>  Comments in other groups in your business area; </li><li>  The use of advertising in social networks. </li></ul><br><br>  More talk about advertising.  Why post it on social networks? <br><br><ul><li>  Every day, social networks are visited by millions of users; </li><li>  The audience is in a psychologically comfortable state, and advertising is perceived as advice from a friend; </li><li>  Word of mouth among users. </li></ul><br><br>  The greatest amount of advertising is placed on Vkontakte and Facebook.  It can be configured quickly enough and pick up your budget. <br><br>  <u>Advertising Vkontakte</u> <br><br>  In order to place your advertisement, scroll down the page and click on "advertisement": <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/6d3/1d5/e32/6d31d5e32d804620840b2ce64846e822.png"><br><br>  Next, set the settings to attract the target audience: location, gender, age, birthday and marital status.  Try also to find the interests or groups in which the target audience may be. <br>  By setting all the settings, you will see the recommended bid in your target group.  Note: the lower the rate, the less often the ads appear. <br><br>  <u>Facebook Ads</u> <br><br>  In order to create an advertisement on Facebook, follow the link from the screenshot and click "Create an advertisement": <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/50f/1e5/815/50f1e58152d04272968d1ea71908da00.png"><br><br>  Next, choose the campaign goal you need, then your page, add images for the ad (from 1 to 6), set the title and ad text and set the parameters of the target audience (location, age, gender, interests, preferences, marital status, education, languages, places of work).  At the very end, you set the budget, schedule and price for your advertising. <br><br>  <b>3. <u>Push notifications</u></b> <br><br>  This is a relatively new tool that is suitable for various purposes, including advertising a product and / or service.  Google Chrome and Safari support sending push notifications that appear instantly on subscribers' desktops, even when the browser is turned off. <br><br>  <b>Benefits of push notifications:</b> <br><br><ul><li>  When you click the user goes directly to the site; </li><li>  To subscribe you need to click only the button ‚ÄúAllow‚Äù; </li><li>  Users do not receive spam; </li><li>  The price of push is several times lower than SMS; </li><li>  Unsubscribe can be done in one click. </li></ul><br><br>  All you need to do to install push to the site is to copy and paste the code before the closing tag.  Now you can push <b>absolutely free</b> with the <a href="https://sendpulse.com/ru/webpush">SendPulse</a> mailing <a href="https://sendpulse.com/ru/webpush">service</a> ! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a82/75c/805/a8275c805d054e91a4c815b1c8d1028d.png"><br><br>  <b>4. <u>Articles</u></b> <br><br>  With advertising in articles, everything is quite simple.  You find thematic areas for placement.  You write an advertising article about your product or service with links to the site and publish for a certain fee. <br>  If you're on a budget, try to write a cool and practical non-promotional material on a topic related to the product.  This will also serve as quite a powerful advertisement, since users love useful information very much. <br><br>  <b>5. <u>Video channel</u></b> <br><br>  Today, users from all over the world spend thousands of hours a month watching various videos.  On average, more than <a href="http://adwords-ru.blogspot.com/2011/07/youtube.html">2.4 million unique users</a> visit YouTube per day.  Video feed is a good way to draw attention to your product or service.  The main thing is a high-quality video.  To create it, you can turn to professionals or remove it yourself (sometimes it works too).  The video should not so much inform users how to engage.  He should like people and cause the desire to share.  This is how viral videos are created, as in the example below: <br><br> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DXjfH8wJ0zqM"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ff0/93d/a1e/ff093da1ef62442d907fefdaae44958f.png"></a> <br><br>  This campaign was called ‚ÄúDo us a favor.‚Äù  In the video, the company Lays asked users to offer a new taste of chips and win a million dollars.  As a result, the audience offered 4 million ideas, and the video gained 12 million views.  Thus, the company significantly increased the loyalty of their customers to the brand and once again effectively advertised their product. <br>  You can leave a link to your website and a detailed description of the product under the video. <br><br>  Any video you make can be sent via email.  This always attracts the user's attention, and brings you additional traffic to the video channel, brand awareness and its products. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/832/690/839/8326908398b04329ae8c1339bb8b1c24.png"><br><br>  <b>6. <u>Events</u></b> <br><br>  Various online and offline events are a good way to announce your brand and familiarize the audience with products and / or services.  The main thing is to accompany advertising with relevant and useful information.  Modern users do not like pure advertising at all.  During the conference or forum, you can organize various competitions and award winners with free provision of their services or products. <br><br>  <b>7. <u>Contextual advertising</u></b> <br><br>  This is the advertisement that is displayed in search engines and on the pages of thematic sites.  It depends on the search query or on the subject of the page on which it is displayed. <br><br>  The two main advertising networks are Yandex (‚ÄúYandex Direct‚Äù) and Google (‚ÄúGoogle Adwords‚Äù).  In order to start using contextual advertising, you need to register in one of these systems, set up an ad, pick up requests for which users will find you, select a region and top up the balance. <br>  You pay only for clicks.  The cost per click depends on many factors: subject, competition, region, ad location, etc. <br><br>  <b>8. <u>Teaser ads</u></b> <br><br>  These are text advertisements with pictures.  Thus, they often advertise questionable services, often with payment via SMS, but there are also ads that advertise real products and services.  Payment - for clicks. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/488/4d3/20f/4884d320fa20488994ba6a885e8cdf6b.png"><br><br>  <b>9. <u>Banners</u></b> <br><br>  Banners are images that contain links to the site.  They are of several types: <br><br><ul><li>  static (one picture without movement); </li><li>  GIF (several images that replace each other); </li><li>  flash (contain animation effects). </li></ul><br>  In order for banners to bring you new customers, you should place them on thematic resources.  For example, if you are a mailing service, then select sites for internet marketing. <br><br>  The cost depends on the size of the banner, its type, placement, theme and of course from the site on which you want to place the banner. <br><br>  You can make and place a banner yourself.  To do this, use the program Photoshop, contact the administrator of the site you need and agree with him about placing a banner.  You can ask him for site statistics on traffic, learn about traffic (gender, age, region, etc.) If you do not want to do everything yourself, contact the special services. <br><br>  <b>10. <u>Bulletin Board</u></b> <br><br>  There are many bulletin boards and most of them are free.  Most often, users only pay to somehow distinguish their ad from others, that is, to make it more visible. <br><br>  You can also contact various services that will place your ad immediately on most existing bulletin boards using automatic programs.  It is inexpensive.  On the part of the customer, you need a description of the product or service, the creation of a title and an indication of contact information. <br>  By the way, this is the only way to advertise without creating your own website. <br><br>  <b>11. <u>Periscope</u></b> <br><br>  Periscope is an application for Android and iOS, designed to broadcast live video streaming.  This service was launched in March 2015, but already in such a short period of time it became popular among users.  It is a great tool for advertising.  Service has become especially popular among young fashion designers.  They broadcast their shows through Periscope and thereby get even more attention to their products. <br>  To invite users to watch your broadcast, post a link to it on Twitter or any other social network.  Make an additional announcement in the mailing list.  This is how Mark Jacobs did it: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/624/9f0/ebe/6249f0ebe8fd44268a405bdc28987d47.png"><br><br>  Now you know about the main ways of advertising products or services on the Internet.
