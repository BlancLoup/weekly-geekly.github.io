We also noticed that the competition for the title of the youngest MCP (Microsoft Certified Professional) seems to be going on, although the sources of the article date back to different years. <br><br>  So, we present a list of children who are 2 times younger than us and perhaps much smarter than most of us: <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arfa_Karim">Arfa Karim Randava (Arfa Karim Randhawa)</a> <br>  Born in 1996. This girl from Pakistan became Microsoft Certified Professional in C # programming at the age of 9 years and 8 months.  She met computers at the age of 6, and preparation for certification took her 4 months. <br><br>  <a href="http://www.babariqbal.com/">Babar Iqbal</a> <br>  Born in Pakistan, Babar became the youngest Wireless Network Administrator (CWNA) in history at the age of 9.  He had already received Microsoft Certified Professional (MCP) and Certified Internet Web Professional Associate (CIW-A) by that time.

      <a href="http://www.signonsandiego.com/news/northcounty/20050826-9999-1mi26smart.html">Scott Goodson</a> <br>  Scott Goodson grew up amusing himself by reading thick volumes of computer documentation.  At the age of 11, he opened his own computer repair shop.  With the permission of the school board, he entered college at the age of 13 and plans to study computer science and electrical engineering. <br><br>  <a href="http://www.expressindia.com/latest-news/Boy-on-verge-of-being-worlds-youngest-3D-animator/220199/">Seth Mridul</a> <br>  In 4 years, Seth has already modified computer games and continues to this day.  At 11, he was already Microsoft Certified Professional and CISCO Certificate Network Associate (CCNA) and knew several programming languages ‚Äã‚Äãsuch as Java and C ++.  He recently completed a three-year 3D animation course at the University of Cambridge (for which he probably spent just 3 months). <br><br>  <a href="http://www.ameinfo.com/121298.html">Mohammed Eisa</a> <br>  Egyptian Mohammed Eyza received an ITE certificate from Cisco and hopes to add CCNA and CCNP to it.  He is 12 years old. <br><br>  <a href="http://degrees.newsforall.com/youngest_mcse.html">S. Chandra Sekar (S. Chandra Sekar)</a> <br>  He began programming at age 8 and at 9 became Microsoft Certified Professional.  When he was 10 he became Microsoft Certified Systems Engineer, and a year later he received the Cisco Certified Network Associate certificate. <br><br>  <a href="http://www.diehardindian.com/news/news0707.htm">Bhupika Yashpal Gautam (Bhupika Yashpal Gautam)</a> <br>  In 1999, at the age of 5 years and 11 months, Bhupik passed the exam, which included a test of practical and theoretical knowledge in C, Unix, Foxpro, Lotus and Wordstar, as well as questions about computer hardware, architecture and system analysis.  The exam is intended for those who are over 18 years old, but Bhupik passed it perfectly. <br><br>  <a href="http://www.rediff.com/search/2002/aug/13kids.htm">Ajay Puri</a> <br>  At the age of 3, he became the youngest web designer in the world, as recorded in the Guinness Book of Records.  He started using a computer when he was just one year old and surprised his parents by sending an e-mail to his grandfather at 1.5 years old. <br><br>  <a href="http://www.geeknewz.com/board/index.php%3Fshowtopic%3D2531">Afsah Shafqat (Afsah Shafqat)</a> <br>  He received the following certifications before she turned 15: Sun Certified Java Programmer (SCJP), Sun Certified Web Component Developer (SCWCD), IBM Certified Object-Oriented Analyst and Designer, IBM Certified XML Developer, Sun Certified Business Component Developer (SCBCD ) and IBM Certified J2EE Developer. <br><br>  It is amazing how early these children started.  If they achieved such success at that age, then what can they achieve when they are 20?  Or 30?  Mind refuses to represent it. <br><br>  We noted too few western children when we were looking for ‚Äúgifted children‚Äù for this list.  Maybe our children play too much video games? </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/31628/">https://habr.com/ru/post/31628/</a></p>
