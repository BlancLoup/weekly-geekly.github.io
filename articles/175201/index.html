In short: above - the project Hippflow, which we have placed.  I would very much like to evaluate it from the point of view of utility for IT-specialists. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  <b>This is something like a tape event for a startup: a kind of twitter, which is generated both manually and automatically.</b>  It works like this: suppose you have Google on your site. Analytics, you run the project in the tracker, plus you upload the number of clients to XML from 1C daily.  Hippflow ‚Äúsucks‚Äù all the data from these sources and generates short reports from them.  Roughly speaking, he went out for dinner, while they were carrying the order - he immediately figured out who was doing what and how he felt in the business incubator.  It turns out the log as above. <br><br>  As can be seen in the log, the first message is loaded from the statistics system, the second from the client download, the third and fourth from the tracker, the fifth is written by hand, the sixth from the list of Hippflow conditions, which brings the data together into mini-reports.

      According to the author of the project, such a thing will be very important for a startup in order to keep up to date with investors, mentors, their business incubators and key customers.  Incubators will be the first customers (moreover, a startup has already agreed with several) - if you have 40 projects, it is difficult to understand who does what when there is no such unifying tape. <br><br>  It helps a lot to understand visualization by color: messages of the same meaning have the same color gamut, which allows one look at the project tape to understand how it is doing, and one look at the general tape for a second to assess the situation in the incubator as a whole. <br><br>  <b>Kirill Chekanov</b> , project manager, pretty much spun among business incubators.  He had an HR project for startups in which students were selected in teams.  Then he realized that the biggest problem for a young team is relations with investors who want to constantly see the progress of the project, moreover in human form, and not in the form of ‚Äúgo to our tracker and look‚Äù <br><br>  Now Hippflow is beta, which is being tested on users and partners.  Now there are partners from the USA, Canada, Ireland, Poland, the Emirate, China, Singapore.  We have agreed with partners to connect their incubators to Hippflow, that they provide Hippflow start-ups with discount placement conditions, mentoring.  It is already clear that in the next major release there will be links with trackers and statistics systems, then GitHab and similar services for developers. <br><br>  This is how the project interface will look like from the inside when it is ‚Äúfinished‚Äù: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/37c/b66/359/37cb663592286096eb0e261d5ef1dedd.jpg"><br><br>  <b>Kirill:</b> <br><blockquote>  I say, looking a bit into the future: All that a startup needs to do is to register with the service by entering a pitch, information about yourself, and adding a logo.  Further, a startup may invite its investors, mentors, and a team to the system.  Each category chooses what it would be interesting to read about the project, this information is shown in the project profile as reminders, so that the project does not forget to post what interests its readers.  Different types of posts have different degrees of privacy, of course. <br><br>  A startup can open access to confidential information to anyone and a follower will learn reports on startup activities every week, without general reports, but only with information that is interesting to the user. <br><br>  Incubators will be able to receive information about what the startup wants to achieve in the near future and what resources it needs for it.  This will allow them (incubators) to know where the project should be helped. <br><br>  Investors receive similar information.  Both categories can indicate which startups they are interested in, so that a project in one click can send them information about themselves - submit an application for participation to the program, request an investment in a fund. </blockquote><br><br><h4>  Current result </h4><br><ul><li>  There is a full beta. </li><li>  Incubators like Hippflow because of the convenient receiving format, and they like very much that Hippflow organizes information and highlights the main points of the startup‚Äôs activities for a certain period. </li><li>  Incubators, Coffice, eOfis, SunshineNY, First meeting place, quicksuites, Credo Ventures, VentureGreenhouse, BinkPlus, TecGlobal, incubators have already signed up, there are several projects inside Hippflow, including domestic Zendesk and Boomstarter. </li></ul><br>  You can see the project profile <a href="http://smartmarket.net/projects/hippflow/">here</a> in our crowdinvestment system. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/175201/">https://habr.com/ru/post/175201/</a></p>
