  <section class="page js-page"><h1>When hiring large international companies refuse diplomas</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The topic of having a diploma in the recruitment process has become almost anecdotal in large companies.  From now on, skills and abilities are the values ‚Äã‚Äãthat matter most of all else. <br>  This is not a new trend, but it shows that in large international companies, the value of the diploma is significantly reduced.  In some cases, the column on the availability of a diploma is missing in personal questionnaires.  The job search site Glassdoor has published a list of fifteen companies this season for which a higher education diploma is not required for candidates.  However, a diploma of a prestigious university or business school will also be a plus. <br><br>  This list, retransmitted by the American Quartz site, includes both major technical giants such as Google, Apple or IBM, but also multinational companies such as Ernst &amp; Young or Starbucks.  The Stanford or Polytechnique diploma ( <a href="https://www.polytechnique.edu/en">√âcole Polytechnique</a> ) has not lost its value, especially for positions of responsibility and leadership. <br><br>  ‚ÄúAcademic training is always taken into account, and it will remain an important criterion in the hiring process, but it will not be an obstacle,‚Äù says companion Ernst &amp; Young, Maggie Steelwell, to the American newspaper Huffington Post. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h3>  The concept of "competence" is crucial </h3><br>  Google was one of the pioneers of this trend.  The American giant very quickly realized that the link between mental abilities in work and a university degree is insignificant and the reason for this is not that they hire only candidates who have graduated from prestigious universities and demonstrate high production rates.  Quartz clarifies that about 15% of new employees at IBM have not even graduated from university.  IBM CEO Virginia Romette even mentioned that for technology giants, professional tasks and on-the-job training will provide more experience than a diploma.

      In France, a study by the state employment agency P√¥le Emploi has noticed a similar trend over the past few months.  59% of employers believe that a degree is not an essential criterion for employment.  The study also notes the importance of "behavioral skills", the so-called "soft skills" in the language of personnel officers.  For 60% of employers, these behavioral skills are considered more important than technical.  For example, we are talking about adaptability, ability to organize or even independence.  In particular, the study by P√¥le Emploi noted that 20,000 people in 2018 will benefit more from the communication skills development manual, and their number will be increased to 80,000 in 2019. <br><br>  "The candidates' personality, their emotional intelligence, their empathy are becoming more and more important elements in the hiring process," explained Charles-Henry Dumont, founder and owner of Morgan Philips employment agency, to Le Figaro.  Including for engineers and other professions, a priori not implying constant communication.  He also agrees with the statements made in the P√¥le emploi study about the diploma: ‚ÄúA programmer with empathy is a gold worker.  On the other hand, the qualities of an educated and highly qualified specialist should also be rewarded. ‚Äù </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/422219/">https://habr.com/ru/post/422219/</a></p>
