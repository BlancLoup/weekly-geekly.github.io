Part 2</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  This is a continuation of the topic <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/personal/107409/">"Trying to open your own business</a> . <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/personal/107409/">"</a> <br>  There are no particular technical issues for the time being, however there are some interesting points. <br><br>  Who cares ... <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  So the first thing I want to say and thank you is that a friend opens the shop himself now, I showed him the comments from the previous post and suggested that he do everything himself, all the more, he built his land and store with his own money.  He reacted absolutely normally.  I also help him with everything related to the store, so in this respect everything is fine. <br><br>  Let's get down to business.

    <h1>  Documents, registration </h1><br><br>  According to the advice of commentators from the previous topic, he chose an IP.  Registration SP procedure is not complicated.  And where many are described, I will not copy-paste, just give a <a href="http://www.rosuchet.ru/articles/35-register/51-regip">link</a> . <br><br>  In reality, there are also no problems with registration, you just need to wait some time (1-2 weeks). <br><br><h2>  Fire Inspection </h2><br>  The fire inspection is also quite adequate people.  The fire inspector will answer your questions, tell you what the specific requirements for your premises will be.  We have this: <br><br><ul><li>  Two fire extinguishers.  We stopped at the OU-2 (Carbon dioxide fire extinguisher. It is relatively inexpensive, and it is easy to maintain) </li><li>  Emergency exit </li><li>  Outline scheme.  (Must be specified path of exit from the premises, if there is where is the button for notification of a fire, if there is where there is a phone, where there are fire extinguishers. </li><li>  You need to be trained in fire safety. </li><li>  It is necessary to appoint a fire safety officer. </li><li>  The person in charge should conduct a fire safety briefing and keep a journal where employees will sign. </li><li>  In an accessible place for everyone should be a sign (sticker) who is responsible for fire safety. </li><li>  Fire alarm.  You can register with the console, but then you have to pay every month, therefore, there will be a regular ‚Äúreamer‚Äù. </li></ul><br><br><h2>  Tax </h2><br>  The tax is also absolutely adequate people.  Explained everything explained.  In general, UTII (for stores with an area of ‚Äã‚Äãmore than 150 m <sup>2, the</sup> STS is possible).  So decided - the first month or two zero income, and then for any profit 4 000 r.  per month - quite bearable. <br><br><h2>  District administration </h2><br>  Absolutely not adequate people in the administration.  Do not give permission to trade, due to the fact that the room "does not meet the requirements."  The requirements are as follows: The room must be collapsible (the advertisement of the metal profile follows).  The fact that the fire department has no complaints about the room does not bother them.  Please indicate these requirements in any GOST or document ignored.  I wrote an e-mail to the President of the Russian Federation (I‚Äôve already helped once), I‚Äôm currently waiting for a response.  I tried to find something on the net, also did not find anything.  If anyone has information please share. <br><br><h1>  Finishing, repair </h1><br><br>  In order to save, they decided to do everything themselves.  Everything turned out to be simple. <br><br><h2>  Walls </h2><br>  There were uneven walls, the four ‚Äújamshut‚Äù walls were filled with zashpatlevat ‚Äúdrink a thousand thousand pills‚Äù 5000r! <br>  Decided simply - texture paint.  In hozmage on picked up color, told how to dissolve and how to apply.  Bought a nozzle on the drill (stirrer) spatula and raised roller.  Spatyle apply paint on the wall, roller roll, giving texture. <br>  As a result, the walls look stylish and smooth. <br><br><h2>  Ceiling </h2><br>  We decided to make a false ceiling.  Since the budget is limited, we chose a ceiling that is assembled from a metal profile and 60cm tiles.  "Dzhamshut" asked for the work of 350 rubles.  per m <sup>2</sup> , we have ~ 25 m <sup>2</sup> , total ~ 8750 rub. <br>  We decided to do it yourself.  In the same store, the guys told how to collect it, also there was an instruction. <br>  It took hydro level, tape measure, level, pencil, punch (or drill with perforation function), dowel pins and 4 days. <br><br>  The most difficult and important every 60 cm (at our ceiling the pitch of the guides is 60 cm, in principle you can do every 120 cm) to beat off the level (sorry for the pun) at the hydro level and mark with a pencil.  Then on these marks in a circle (on all walls) fix the corner on which all guides will fall.  As soon as you do this, the ceiling is assembled by the designer.  It remains only to hang it with special hooks to the ceiling.  Sometimes the guides will have to be cut, I do not advise using a grinder, it is better to take a metal file in smaller and neatly sawing, it will be more difficult, but the quality is higher. <br><br><h2>  Lighting </h2><br>  At first they thought to take special square blocks to this type of ceiling (there are 4 fluorescent lamps in one block), but they changed their minds.  The price of one block is about 350 rubles.  We decided to buy white energy-saving lamps and cartridges for them.  (1 white light bulb 35 W - 120 rubles, cartridge - 40 rubles). <br><br>  Gently cutter (cutting on the drill) or with a stationery knife cut holes in the tiles, previously outlining the cartridge with a pencil.  Under the ceiling we throw the wires for the light bulbs, put the tile with the hole in place, pull out the wires through the cut hole, fasten the wires into the cartridge, insert the cartridge into the hole.  Is done. <br><br><h2>  Wiring </h2><br>  Our only mistake - did not immediately think about the wiring.  Wiring was, but we did not bother to examine it.  The wiring was in a terrible state, and we decided to just cut it and wall it.  We need 1 outlet, connect the air conditioner, connect the lighting, connect the street lighting, connect the fire alarm, connect the video surveillance.  We decided that each element will be on a separate machine to immediately know where the problem is.  To the outlet and the switches, the wires will be routed into the cable channels in order not to chisel the freshly painted walls.  The rest of the wiring is under the ceiling.  They also decided to purchase a two-zone electric meter, which will consider the energy consumed day and night separately, which will save money on the costs of energy from street lighting, video surveillance, and fire alarm (although she does not really consume anything). <br><br><h1>  Automation </h1><br><br>  Quite a problematic issue, beating on a pocket like a sledgehammer.  At first they thought to get a PC (nettop) to put 1c, cash register, barcode scanner.  But as it turned out for different kinds of goods different requirements for printing checks. (Sometimes a simple thermal printer is not enough and you need a fiscal recorder) In general, all this is very expensive (Nettop - ~ 5,000 rubles, km - ~ 18,000 rubles, barcode scanner code - ~ 5000 rub., thermal printer - ~ 10,000 rub., 1C with a normal license ~ 14,000 rub., total ~ 42,000). <br><br>  In the end, a friend decided to take an autonomous CMC with a screen and barcode encoders for about 20,000 rubles.  This KKM has an opportunity of unloading in 1C on a flash card.  In general, quite decent, given that no hypermarket opens. <br><br><h2>  Open an account </h2><br>  This is the simplest thing that can be.  Account opened in the bank where I work. <br>  The list of documents may vary depending on the bank.  But usually it is: <br><ol><li>  Application for opening an account (written in the bank) </li><li>  Cash Management Agreement (also in the bank) </li><li>  Copy of the passport </li><li>  Copy of the certificate of registration of the SP, notarized </li><li>  Copy of the Tax Registration Certificate, notarized </li><li>  Extract from the Unified State Register (which is not more than 30 days) </li></ol><br><br>  The price of the issue depends on the bank.  We have 1,200 rubles (Opening an account + Bank-Client Online [Internet banking]). <br>  In the month of service 400 rubles.  If there are no operations, then there will be no service charge. <br><br>  PS: This is what is obtained at the moment: <br> <a title="Habraffe.ru" href=""><img width="640" height="480" src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/62/f8/62f8c61763a2c469c9514206c6ac7704.jpg"></a> <br><br><br> <a title="Habraffe.ru" href=""><img width="640" height="480" src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/a4/f8/a4f8e43d0afc7b7263dd22dd58cb1779.jpg"></a> <br><br>  PPS: Next, plan: <br><ol><li>  Consider the same design program (windows / linux) </li><li>  CCTV organization </li><li>  Organization of online store.  (Order products, pre-order) </li><li>  We plan to arrange delivery.  I will share the experience. </li><li>  Advertising </li><li>  How are things going ... </li></ol><br><br>  <b>UPD: About the wiring, or rather, how the automata are organized, I will also describe in the next article.</b>  <b>I am not a professional electrician, but it seems to me that I did much better than what was done before me.</b> <b><br><br></b>  <b>Oh yeah, I'll give you a snack for a link to the online store of one of the suppliers.</b> <b><br></b>  <b><a href="http://www.japandv.ru/auxpage_1/">http://www.japandv.ru</a></b> <b><br><br></b>  <b>In general, you need to communicate with each supplier, perhaps they will give a discount ... you should also consider that something is cheaper to take in Khabarovsk, something in Vladivostok, if you take containers in Japan, of course.</b> <b><br></b> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/109501/">https://habr.com/ru/post/109501/</a></p>
