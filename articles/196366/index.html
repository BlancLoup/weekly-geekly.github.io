And also for all experiencing.  I do not mean large teams and applications / games with an insane amount of downloads, but perhaps this little research will be useful for them. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  Input data: </h4><br>  Android application.

It seems a bit, but the amount is still significant in order to worry about it. <br><br>  Total <br><ol><li>  There is an application.  For some search queries on their topics in the top. </li><li>  There are users: about 10 000-15 000 active. </li><li>  A third of users are Russians. </li><li>  Application is not a game. </li><li>  There are no publishers.  In truth, until recently, I did not know about their existence, since I don‚Äôt play games. </li><li>  eCPM is normal (~ $ 0.58).  To be honest, I didn‚Äôt really think about eCMP: they are and they are, they click and click.  I don `t care.  But further studies have shown that this parameter is very interesting.  <b>UPDATE:</b> in the comments said that this is high eCMP for Admob.  Perhaps because it is not a game, but an application with content. </li></ol><br>  Task: to find an ad network to which you could go with <b>Admob</b> . <br><br><h4>  Lyrics </h4>  (you can scroll through either to Physics or to Results): <br>  What prompted me to research? <br>  It all started with the fact that at the end of August all developers on <b>Admob</b> had a die at the top that appeared <b>Admob 2.0</b> .  Fashionable, modern, innovative.  Fortunately, in Russia at that time there was no functional opportunity to switch to it.  In Ukraine, the update was available, because I learned a lot of interesting things from the Internet. <br>  Firstly, <b>Admob</b> in Russia and Ukraine no longer supports transfers to a bank account. <br>  Secondly, checks will be transported by a <s>tortoise</s> <s>slave on galleys</s> Russian Post. <br>  Thirdly, there is some kind of <b>Rapida</b> ( <a href="http://adsense.rapida.ru/">link</a> ), which I have not used in my life.  Courier delivery, etc., but still, there $ 15 will have to spend.  Correct if not so.  Still did not understand in detail. <br>  Fourth, you will need to catch a letter with a code to the address (real address) to confirm, taking into account the insane amount of spam in the mailboxes of Moscow and the <s>absence of</s> idleness of Russian Post in other regions, it turns out an unpleasant situation. <br><br>  In my head there was a thought: to fall for the pig with <b>Admob</b> . <br><br>  Found <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/192570/">it</a> but here, by and large, nothing useful at all, except for a couple of <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/192570/">comments</a> .  There is also a couple of threads on the w3bsit3-dns.com forum about how to switch to the new <b>Admob</b> .  And that's all.  <a href="http://www.appbrain.com/stats/libraries/ad">The most useful link</a> . <br><br><h4>  Physics: </h4><br>  The main criteria for the advertising network that I need. <br><ol><li>  High occupancy rate in Russia (fill rate). </li><li>  High income. </li><li>  Low qualification of payments. </li><li>  Withdrawing money to a bank account. </li><li>  Withdraw money as quickly as possible. </li></ol><br><br><h5>  Admob ( <a href="http://admob.com/">link</a> ): </h5><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage3/0a0/5e0/c16/0a05e0c16b33906856ed5a160be71dcd.png"><br>  Everything is clear with him.  For Russia, now either checks or <b>Rapida</b> , for Ukraine - checks.  $ 100 for withdrawal on the old.  On the new one I don‚Äôt know how much, but, definitely, no more.  Money transfer for <b>Rapida</b> - 30 days.  But I do not know how there travel through mail / couriers and the like.  Just in case, correct. <br><br><h5>  Millennial media (Mmedia) ( <a href="http://mmedia.com/">link</a> ): </h5><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage3/9cc/7fb/3ef/9cc7fb3ef2c8aef08f7149f28813dbee.png"><br>  Cashout: $ 500 per card, $ 50 Paypal.  Withdrawal - 2 months. <br>  The site is beautiful.  In my opinion, the site is beautiful, but uncomfortable.  There was an error with the login that it was impossible to enter, everything is very slow.  From the phone uncomfortable.  The support is good. <br><br><h5>  Inmobi ( <a href="http://inmobi.com/">link</a> ): </h5><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage3/9df/b34/801/9dfb348015e61f1703424d123d5ac621.png"><br>  India.  Cashout: $ 300.  Occupancy rate in Russia is claimed to support 70%.  Given the large numbers for the withdrawal I did not fit.  Although I have registered. <br><br><h5>  Tapjoy ( <a href="http://tapjoy.com/">link</a> ): </h5><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage3/f32/512/eaa/f32512eaa021cd1882bcd967bf9eddba.png"><br>  After searching on the Internet, something is not interested.  In Russia, not popular.  Although, maybe I'm wrong.  Write who knows what. <br>  Cashout: $ 250 <br><br><h5>  ChartBoost ( <a href="http://chartboost.com/">link</a> ): </h5><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage3/fe6/398/b93/fe6398b93bb33672d021627c7c152ec1.png"><br>  Cashout: $ 300.  Conclusion from 30 days.  There are no advertising banners, but only full-screen advertising.  They require that the application was just a game, and not something else.  This I learned from support.  So, flies by.  Not my case. <br><br><h5>  Mopub ( <a href="http://mopub.com/">link</a> ): </h5><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage3/a9f/991/ca2/a9f991ca235faf3c6b5487feb93a67ae.png"><br>  Withdrawal: $ 100, 60 days of withdrawal.  Many positive reviews in the Internet. <br>  But the most important feature that I liked was that you can track other networks.  And also embed banners from <b>Admob</b> and <b>Mmedia</b> .  The system selects (among ad networks, as well as among its banners) which banner is more expensive, and this one shows. <br>  To register other networks, you need a login and password.  Some are scared.  In principle, everything is recorded well.  There are manuals. <br>  This is what I will check. <br><br>  But for now about three networks. <br><br><h5>  RevMob ( <a href="http://revmob.com/">link</a> ): </h5><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage3/be5/d60/e74/be5d60e7417c76d4547e7f7f1fb5bc16.png"><br>  I will highlight <b>RevMob</b> , although it is not high in that rating, but <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/192570/">here</a> , and, in general, everywhere, they say that high eCMP.  But, judging by the forums, eCMP for them has dropped significantly and / or jumps very strongly, it does not work in Russia.  If not right, correct. <br>  <b>UPDATE:</b> In PM showed that some eCMP can be high.  I continue to observe. <br><br><h5>  AirPush ( <a href="http://airpush.com/">link</a> ): </h5><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage3/47e/feb/0b5/47efeb0b5db06423888b8fb10a0b695f.png"><br>  I will also highlight <b>AirPush</b> .  Since I work with him.  For me, it turns out that this network does not give any good financial results at all.  Because users of the application with it are deleted.  Whatever the cost of clicks on notifications or cost, no one wants to have a ugly advertisement in notifications.  If the main application 33% of users save the application, then in additional only 10%. <br>  I will explain: in my application there are additional options.  To unlock some content, you need to download or pay the app from <b>Google Play</b> or download it for free, but from <b>AirPush</b> .  Thus, I scare users from the free version.  And that's all.  In 5 months of use, I got something around $ 35.  I think in general it is necessary to move away from him and go to full-screen advertising from <b>Admob</b> .  Does anyone have a success-story of using <b>AirPush</b> ?  In which cases it is effective, I did not understand. <br><br><h5>  WapStart (Russia) ( <a href="http://wapstart.ru/">link</a> ): </h5><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage3/016/bfc/613/016bfc61368d5751c15b829799ce9988.png"><br>  Only registered, but did not use it, because there was not really a desire to program different banners for different countries.  Still, 2/3 of the users are not from Russia.  I'll have to try, but later.  Conveniently, the withdrawal of money on <b>WebMoney</b> . <br>  <b>UPDATE:</b> The comments do not recommend using Russian networks.  They have a very low fill rate. <br>  Who cares how to find the right conditions for the transfer of money: <br>  &lt;ad network name&gt; + payment terms. <br>  The rest looked partially - something did not really inspire confidence, and / or I was too lazy, and / or they were at the bottom of the rating, which means that the filling in Russia will be small. <br>  Most importantly, for all ad networks except <b>Admob</b> and <b>Airpush</b> , a new account is checked.  Be sure to write in support for confirmation.  In all the above mentioned networks where I registered, they wrote everywhere on the site, which will be confirmed in 48 hours.  This is not true.  It always lasted over 48 hours.  I had to write in support.  But, it is necessary to recognize that the support of all responds within a day and confirms everything at once.  I advise you to write to them as soon as you make a trial request for the advertising network from your phone. <br><br><h4>  Experiment: </h4><br>  There are <b>Mopub</b> and <b>Mmedia</b> , which we will compare with <b>Admob</b> in the context of my application. <br>  Tested for 2.5 days (it was a pity to spend more time on this).  September 30 in the evening, October 1 and 2, 2013.  That is, <b>everywhere we look at the last three columns / three points</b> . <br><br>  In <b>Mopub, the</b> concept of work is: <br>  There is an application (you can have several).  He has banners (you can have several), there are advertising networks that can be turned on and off for the corresponding banner. <br>  In my case, the display included native display <b>MoPub</b> , as well as <b>Admob</b> and <b>Mmedia</b> . <br>  Note: you can turn off native advertising. <br><br>  Main picture: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage3/6de/048/deb/6de048deb569d655cf4017f107ae7e8f.png"><br>  Displays profit on all networks that you have configured to view.  <b>Admob</b> has an error in calculations with eCPM.  Immediately you can see that the profits, fill rate and eCMP of <b>Admob are</b> falling when using the network than in my <b>Admob</b> (from $ 0.6 for all the time). <br><br>  But we go further.  <b>AdMob metrics</b> : <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage3/11d/074/e72/11d074e7273c7098807205a7a2e346fa.png"><br>  Orange color - indicators from banner calls from <b>AdMob</b> from the native SDK, blue - from <b>Mopub</b> .  It is seen that requests are falling.  Where do they go?  In <b>Mopub</b> Banners and <b>Mmedia</b> Banners.  Moreover, what is below the orange tsiferkami, CPM - these are the values ‚Äã‚Äãthat are set, not the real values ‚Äã‚Äãthat were.  CTR is also lower.  I understand that it is necessary to check more time, fluctuations, etc., but still. <br><br>  Performance by <b>Millennial Media (Mmedia)</b> . <br>  Similarly, only mappings are even smaller. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage3/29f/b86/0c1/29fb860c15c970b25704e934cae3c2a6.png"><br>  The data differs from the official site.  Probably, <s>time flows differently</s> , due to time zones, etc.  But the essence is the same: eCPM - $ 0.04.  I earned $ 0.08, which is not enough for $ 500 withdrawal. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage3/236/aa7/fe4/236aa7fe4f6e0dccf1577cf8304ee110.png"><br><br>  Native <b>Mopub-</b> advertising. <br>  Seems not bad.  At first sight. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage3/a5e/ddf/097/a5eddf0970929fed7b3a2546cadb3557.png"><br><br>  Here are the eCMP figures.  On the last day, this is still higher than the first, but I set the minimum eCPM in the banner settings above day after day from 10 cents to 50 to increase profits, but the profit almost did not grow. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage3/9e9/401/baa/9e9401baa051de83a20b6029f78aba14.png"><br><br>  And "as if growing" due to the fact that the network discards its own low-budget advertising and gives advertisements from Admob and Mmedia.  Profit is spread over 3 networks (well, or 2, if Mmedia is excluded).  But total profit falls.  In my case, I dropped from $ 6.9 on September 29 to $ 3.1 on October 2.  This is depicted on the very first graph. <br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Here it is, not to thumb through</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage3/6de/048/deb/6de048deb569d655cf4017f107ae7e8f.png"></div></div><br><br>  Graph of the number of ad displays.  It can be seen falling more than 2 times. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage3/68e/ed3/1a8/68eed31a8f560c7852c5b49b42c81e77.png"><br><br>  It turns out that I will not be able to earn the minimum amount of two networks to get money, but I want them every month.  In addition, very low occupancy rates.  In my opinion, this will not give effective results for a month.  At least personally for my application. <br><br>  Earned at <b>Mopub</b> : $ 2.58. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage3/3ff/50a/c2d/3ff50ac2d15d0ea21e10a6608b5a7a93.png"><br><br><h4>  Results: </h4><br><br>  <b>Mopub</b> - for the test - great.  Maybe for the United States and Europe will roll, but I have not gone. <br>  Alternative networks cannot offer a more efficient solution for the above parameters than Admob. <br>  Spent on a few dollars "non-clicked" ads on <b>Admob</b> <s>, but for Habr is not a pity</s> . <br>  I will understand what to do when switching to the new <b>Admob</b> . <br>  I will sit to the last on the old version. <br>  I hope that helped someone figure out what to do next. <br>  Another reason why it is worth staying on <b>Admob</b> , in my opinion, is the presence on the banners of other networks of advertisements like ‚Äúupgrade Android to a new Trojan‚Äù.  If you love users, and not just money, maybe this will still be some factor. <br>  For more popular programs, maybe it will be interesting, but this advertising revenue should be, offhand, from $ 500.  But it must be tested.  For games, there may be other eCMP metrics, so the results may be different. <br><br><h4>  Why did this happen? </h4><br>  Perhaps advertisers use this network in Russia more often than others.  And the cost is higher.  But I do not know. <br>  Perhaps, since the application is not gaming, it does not require advertising of games, but something else, so that users click on the advertisement.  <b>Admob has more</b> such ads. <br>  I think that the situation is similar in other advertising networks, otherwise everyone would have moved there together, or they would have a pronounced leader who could compete with <b>Google</b> . <br>  You may say that 3 days is not an indicator.  In my subjective opinion, the main trends can still be highlighted. <br>  From <b>Admob</b> not run away. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/196366/">https://habr.com/ru/post/196366/</a></p>
