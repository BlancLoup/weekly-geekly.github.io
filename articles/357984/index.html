Initially, there was no doubt about the possibility of implementing the plan.  But then something went wrong: the messenger, even with malfunctions, continued to work, but many other resources, including the site of Roskomnadzor itself, refused to open. <br><br>  The apogee of the confrontation happened on the night of April 27, when Roskomnadzor <a href="https://geektimes.com/post/300391/">sent</a> to block the addresses of a number of Russian companies, including Yandex, Vkontakte and some others.  True, after a few hours, the blocking was lifted, but the companies themselves did not begin to restrain themselves and began to speak out about what was happening. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  For example, according to Ochir Mandzhikov, director of public relations at Yandex, Roskomnadzor began to harm the whole RuNet by its actions: ‚ÄúTrying to block Telegram in Russia suddenly became a blow to the entire RuNet.  The lock affected not only the messenger - many resources and their users suffered.  We do not consider this situation normal. ‚Äù

      According to representatives of Yandex, the Russian market is able to develop only when there are conditions for open competition.  But restricting access to various kinds of resources and services to the development of the runet is harmful.  Therefore, the company believes that the lack of choice for the user is one of the most dangerous consequences of blocking.  In its assessment of what is happening, the company went even further, stating that the unstable situation with runet deprives the country of the possibility of technological competition in world markets in the future. <br><br>  Telegram unexpectedly supported the social network "Vkontakte".  Managing Director of the resource Andrei Rogozov said that the transfer of any keys and access to information outside the device with the messenger, where end-to-end encryption works, is impossible by definition. <br><br>  Rogozov commented on the situation as follows: ‚ÄúWe see how, due to a lack of understanding of the principles of the modern Internet, access to a variety of resources is limited.  The services that are used by millions of people are completely or partially unavailable.  This limits or complicates the work of businesses, primarily technological ones. ‚Äù  The social network said that Roskomnadzor blocked one of the addresses of the social network, because of which some of the users lost access to the resource.  In addition, Vkontakte had to disable the integration of the ReCaptcha service, which Vkontakte uses to combat spam. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/19d/ac6/81d/19dac681d47393208970f43b02ac7c1f.jpg"><br><br>  Anton Fedchin, head of Odnoklassniki, <a href="https://ok.ru/okmedia/topic/68281289059145">believes</a> that the situation with the blocking of Telegram (or rather, attempts to block the messenger) already affects the business as a whole.  So, almost any company now depends on the uninterrupted operation of the Internet, since communication with customers occurs mainly on the network.  Failures in the Russian-speaking segment of the Internet are beginning to affect not only the Internet, but also the entire Russian economy as a whole. <br><br>  If we take the Internet business, then the situation is even more difficult, because how can you develop new directions if users lose access to them?  Odnoklassniki has a problem with it: ‚ÄúWe are taking the first steps towards e-commerce and have launched our marketplace with goods, but if there is no quick and convenient access to these products, all this will not be necessary: ‚Äã‚Äãit‚Äôs easier to go to the market or regular store. " <br><br>  Nino Donazde, head of Qiwi's PR department, <a href="https://www.rbc.ru/rbcfreenews/5ae443ea9a7947c381900e33">said</a> that the company ‚Äúfor a free runet and against digital inequality and any restriction of user access to the Internet.  We believe that in the era of digitalization, a rational dialogue between government and business is needed to find a balance between security and the development of innovative technologies. ‚Äù  If you make any decisions that limit the development of technologies, these decisions should be made taking into account the realism of their implementation, as well as an assessment of the consequences for the business.  In Qiwi, the actions of the supervisory authority (that is, Roskomnadzor) are compared with an elephant in a china shop.  And now everyone is suffering, except Telegram. <br><br>  Approximately the same opinion is expressed by representatives of <a href="https://vk.com/wall-35005_30944">Mail.ru</a> , <a href="https://www.rbc.ru/rbcfreenews/5ae3564e9a79478d61c2e50c">Rambler</a> and other companies. <br><br>  Well, Roskomnadzor, which is quite logical, does not consider himself guilty in the incident.  According to the ministry, foreign companies are to blame for all the problems of the Runet: ‚ÄúThe actions of a number of foreign companies that continue to provide Telegram hosting services lead to failures in the websites, which is a deliberate obstruction of the execution of the decision of the Tagansky District Court of Moscow regarding Telegram.‚Äù </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/357984/">https://habr.com/ru/post/357984/</a></p>
