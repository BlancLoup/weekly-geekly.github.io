Spectacle, from the Latin. Spectulum - spectacle). <br>  So, I was so tired of this spectacle, of the angry crowds of Internet users, of the posts on Twitter, and of the grinding of RU-CENTER‚Äôs bones, that I also decided to ‚Äúpomosolit‚Äù this topic.  I am very surprised how the audience reacted to Habr, and the whole Runet to the actions of RU-CENTER.  I do not want to either block or blacken anyone.  And to count who earned how much, will earn, and who how much has received less or will receive less, will be an accountant, or lawyers, I'm not going to do that.  I‚Äôm more surprised that RU-CENTER is to blame for everything, and any other company could be in its place, and for the most part all registrars look like two drops of water, since almost everyone had preliminary bids, auctions, and other similar mechanisms.  And it turns out that the ‚Äúsystem‚Äù is being blown away by the one who beat out in this race ... <br><br>  I see all this registration as a performance in 4 acts, about each I wrote a couple, and some where more words.  In some I was even, a kind of actor, and described the so-called "look from the scene." <a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h4>  ACT 1. Priority Registration </h4>

        </script>
      <br>
      I was late for the first act, so I‚Äôll start the story with the second one. <br><br>  <i>View from the scene: Actually, I personally did not participate in it, since I am not from government agencies, I did not have a trademark or trademark, and there was no money for its (his) acquisition, as I did for example: Open independent logistic association ‚ÄúIota N ".</i>  <i>And since I did not participate in it, I can‚Äôt tell a lot, so I‚Äôll tell you about what I participated in.</i> <br><br><h4>  ACT 2. Pre-registration </h4><br><br>  <b>FACT No. 1. ‚ÄúPre-registration was practically with all registrars, and only with large 100%‚Äù.</b>  You can look at Yandex, at the request of ‚Äúpre-registration of domains of the Russian Federation,‚Äù most of the registrars have already deleted this data due to the scandal, but Yandex remembers, and so far safely stores them in its cache.  I did not look at the conditions of preliminary registrations of other registrars, but I‚Äôm willing to bet that there is more than one ‚Äúso clever‚Äù your RU-CENTER.  In spite of the FACT No. 1. all of them are ringing only about RU-CENTER.  The question is why?  Because he won the majority of orders for pre-registration, than terribly upset the "squatters", as well as other registrars, and this is a lot of money, and all this money sailed from them.  The situation is complicated by the fact that many did not read the rules of preliminary registration, believing that once the money was written off from the account, the domain is already yours.  And it was not there!  <b>FACT 2. ‚ÄúNeither RU-CENTER, nor other registrars promised you that domains after pre-registration will immediately become yours, you can read the rules of pre-registration.‚Äù</b>  And in spite of FACT 2. All twitter and LiveJournal, filled with records, from the series: ‚ÄúOh shit !!!, RU-CENTER‚Äú stole my domain from me |  registered for yourself |  posted on auction |  terribly deceived my hopes ‚Äù, substitute how you like.  I even specifically took screenshots from the monitor screen so that information would remain as a memory of this agony.  Then these domains will be transferred to ‚ÄúClosed auctions‚Äù, read below. <br><br>  <i>View from the scene: I also participated in the preliminary registration of RU-CENTER, or in the registration by reservation, I do not know how it sounds right, since each registrar is written differently.</i>  <i>But, I did this step consciously, knowing that those domains for which more than 2 applications will be auctions.</i>  <i>As a result, out of 8 applications, I received only one domain, and this is the domain with the name of my company.</i>  <i>The rest went to the auctions, and to some extent I am glad that the domains have not yet passed into the hands of the squatters and are being traded.</i>  <i>I am not used to counting other people's money, and it makes no difference to me who pays money for a domain I need, in any case, it would either be a RU-CENTER auction, or an auction from another registrar, or a ‚Äúsquatter‚Äù that might have broken the price more than all taken together auctions.</i> <br><br><h5>  ACT 3. Open registration </h5><br><br>  Open registration began so rapidly that after the hand had dropped by 12 hours, everyone who could, went to the sites of the registrars and they immediately ‚Äúfell‚Äù as well.  In this wave, all the other domains that squatters did not buy in the 1st act, and those domains that did not go to private auctions, began to buy.  "Squatters" wanted to become the majority, if not the entire population.  After hearing tales of wealth from sales of domains in the ‚Äú.RU‚Äù zone, everyone ran to give their money.  Why do I say everything?  This impression was just formed, otherwise how can one explain this: <br>  domain: XN - 80ABUGBHV9A.XN - P1AI (kilobyte.rf) <br>  state: REGISTERED, NOT DELEGATED, VERIFIED <br>  org: Moscow Taxi LLC <br>  Although perhaps this is their new tariff plan - "Pay per kilobyte!".  Maybe this is a web studio with the original name, if so, I apologize publicly. <br><br>  In the end, they bought everything!  And everything that could only be called ‚Äútasty‚Äù, ‚Äútolerant‚Äù, and even ‚Äúunnecessary‚Äù by the evening of open registration was registered, and these are about 200 thousand domains.  If I'm wrong, correct.  Zone ". RF" broke all records.  Open registration is still going on, but, unfortunately, for many it has ended, and not having time to begin.  The dream of our President, that zon.RF will allow every citizen of our country to get their representation on the Internet no longer looks so rosy, although I think that the addresses in the series ‚ÄúNAME-NAME-REPRESENTATION-SERIES OF PASSPORT ‚ÄìNUMP PASSPORT.RF‚Äù free, at least I could not register my first and last name, they were already taken.  Open registration is open, we will not focus our attention on it and move on to the next act.  And if someone wants to buy domains, then you are welcome ... <br><br>  <i>View from the scene: Actually, I, like everyone else, also participated in open registration, and I had decent orders (I thought) for domain registration orders. In the first wave, I submitted over 30 orders for my projects, my customers' projects, and even for sale (since I do not differ from ordinary people).</i>  <i>A day later, more than half were registered by a certain firm ‚ÄúPersonnel N‚Äù, and RU-CENTER only replied that ‚Äúregistration is impossible‚Äù.</i>  <i>So, not all domains were purchased by the ‚Äúsinister‚Äù RU-CENTER.</i>  <i>Then, when the money was unblocked, I bought several more domains, although by the evening of the second day all the vocabulary words and nearby with them were either registered or at closed auctions.</i> <br><br><h4>  ACT 4. Closed auctions </h4><br><br>  The public is raging, all the squatters who hoped that the domains for which they applied in the 2nd act will become a new decoration of their collection and will bring them many, many money, literally slip away from their hands.  How to be, the ‚Äúevil‚Äù RU-CENTER took their domains to closed auctions and tries to get more from them than they hoped to spend.  Everyone immediately starts writing letters to the President, FAS, and other structures, so, they say, and so, those ‚Äútasty‚Äù domains that we wanted to buy, bought RU-CENTER, ah-ah-ah!  But we planned to buy them and resell them later, and not for 3 - 4 thousand rubles, and generally not for rubles, and the bar for sale would be within hundreds of thousands of dollars. <br><br>  Look, for example, how much do the counterparts sell in the ‚Äú.RU‚Äù zone.  The simplest example is the famous site ‚Äúpivo.ru‚Äù.  On the site itself they say about the sale of it, and the price will please anyone, here‚Äôs a simple quote from the site: ‚ÄúI received this letter in early January:‚Äú Nikita, hello!  My bid is $ 150,000.  Let's make an offer officially.  My details below ... "".  $ 150,000 was offered at the beginning of January, and the site has not yet been sold, probably the price is too low ... <br><br>  On the Internet, you can find even more ‚Äútempting‚Äù offers, for example, ‚Äúsms.ru‚Äù at the time of this writing, put up for sale on the same RU-CENTER, for $ 5,000,000, and next to it, slightly more expensive ‚Äúkonsultirovanie .ru ¬ªfor $ 5,001,180. Fair prices, isn't it? <br><br>  The epic of ‚Äú.‚Äù is not finished yet, and the resale of domains has already begun, as the Business newspaper Marker writes, the domain of ‚ÄúCity car‚Äù - ‚Äúyo-mobil.rf‚Äù was registered in its name by a certain Anton Titov, who has no relation to it. .  Who does not know "City car" is a project of a car developed by Prokhorov and Biryukov, and they, the money is there, and therefore what happens next?  The newspaper "Marker" writes that the same Anton Titov, replied that he would be: "interested in selling for $ 500 thousand."  $ 500,000 is good money, especially when there is someone to take. <br><br>  Let us return to RU-CENTER, which, one might say, stole boldly, the money earned by ‚Äúhard work‚Äù of those who failed to buy out ‚Äútheir‚Äù domains.  And the question is that people wanted ‚Äúto cut the dough out easy, by buying a domain for 600 rubles and selling it for $ 600,000. And not at that, at closed auctions you have to pay more than 600 rubles for domains.  As a result, everyone starts to count other people's money and dig into dirty laundry, which, by the way, everyone has without exception. <br><br>  <i>View from the scene: At the moment, I also continue to participate in auctions, hoping to outbid the domain I am interested in.</i>  <i>And I will be very sad if the auctions are canceled, since then I will have much less chances to purchase the domain I need.</i> <br><br><h4>  EPILOGUE </h4><br><br>  All this registration is similar to the section of a huge cake, and those who did not get a piece are ready to tear it out of the neighbor‚Äôs mouth, and if it is not to tear out the whole, then at least break it off.  The question is that someone had time to eat it, and after the fight it‚Äôs already useless to wave hands.  No one says that RU-CENTER is an ‚Äúangel‚Äù, but to say that all the others are ‚Äúangels‚Äù is simply stupid, because if someone else won from the registrars, they would have auctions and this piece of cake they would have eaten.  This business, managed to hedge, make connections, build bridges - get the money, did not have time - blame yourself. <br><br><h5>  WHAT WOULD BE IF ... </h5><br><br>  What would happen if there was no pre-registration, and open registration would be the same for everyone?  Recall the registrar server at the first moment of registration.  Yes, they worked through time, and sometimes they were completely ‚Äúlying‚Äù, and RU-CENTER is not an exception.  Provided that there would be no pre-registration, then the number of people at registration increased by another hundred thousand, those hundred thousand who did not worry hoping for pre-registration.  Servers and registrars would not cope in a few hours, but during a day, or days.  And after this cruel agony would be followed by the resale of domains with a huge cost, which would be more than those that are now at auction. <br><br><h5>  PS </h5><br>  To be honest, I first started writing a comment with my opinion about what is happening, but then this comment became too big, and I had to write a post ... </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/108419/">https://habr.com/ru/post/108419/</a></p>
