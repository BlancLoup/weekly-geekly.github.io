It so happened that I rested for a long time and wanted to be a good developer, and that everyone would fall behind me with the guidance of people.  After many years, my leader, nevertheless, managed to teach me how to lead, but this path was long and difficult.  I recently read the article " <a href="http://queue.acm.org/detail.cfm%3Fid%3D2926696">Delegation as Art</a> " and remembered the rake, which was passed more than once.  Here they are in all their glory: <br><br>  <b>This is my task!</b>  .  ‚ÄúI want to solve it and do not want to give it to anyone.  How can I give this task to another person, it‚Äôs so interesting for me to invent and implement, and then watch how wonderful everything works. ‚Äù <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/fb5/82c/c48/fb582cc481ca44328f6f77a41cabd64b.jpg"></div><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <i>What is the problem?</i>

      In fact, by the time you need to delegate your tasks, you most likely have not one, but 10, 20 or more important tasks.  Important and necessary, which must be done by a certain date.  Your employee, to whom you could give this task, has fewer, or they are not so important and they can be moved.  Perhaps I had more experience in solving such problems, and based on this I could solve it better.  If I only had this task.  But since I have a lot of others and they all do not fit even in an extended working day of more than 8 hours, the solution of these problems is postponed or stretched.  In addition, the person who receives the task will be able to devote all his time to it.  So, perhaps it will make it much better.  Too much "maybe"?  Let's assume that he will make her worse than you would have done yourself.  But certainly before. <br><br>  And as someone said smart (I do not remember who): "A good decision on Monday is better than excellent on Friday." <br><br>  <i>Decision:</i> <br><br>  I began to give tasks, while it is desirable to give the full task directly, without imposing my own solution.  It helps a lot in the early stages of discussing the process at each of the stages: planning the solution of the problem, dividing it into stages, discussing at the beginning and at the end of each stage. <br><br>  Pros: time is available for other tasks, or perhaps the working day will again be 8 hours and you will finally sleep and stay with your family.  The person to whom you will give the task will contribute to the project and will have the opportunity to ‚Äúpump‚Äù their skills, and implementation questions will not be asked later, but by him. <br><br>  <b>I'm the smartest</b> .  Some tasks do not want to be delegated, as there is a distrust of colleagues.  Sometimes a thought arises: ‚ÄúYou will give up the task, and there everything is realized not in the right way‚Äù. <br><br>  <i>What is the problem?</i> <br><br>  They become the most intelligent when solving complex problems.  Do you feel?  The problem here is that not giving the staff more and more difficult tasks their level does not increase.  You do not give them a chance to grow. <br><br>  <i>Decision:</i> <br><br>  Perhaps you are the smartest.  It is possible and they do not realize perfectly - but then again, it will work like that.  A working system with flaws is always better than an ideal and unimplemented system.  You can discuss the task and agree on the implementation, see above. <br><br>  <b>There is longer to explain than to do.</b>  ‚ÄúDo - 5 minutes to do, and explain - 30 minutes, and sometimes 2 hours.  I'll do it myself! ‚Äù <br><br>  <i>What is the problem?</i> <br><br>  Typically, these 5-minute tasks occur periodically.  They, it seems, are not big, but they eat up time and distract from more important tasks. <br><br>  <i>Decision:</i> <br><br>  Give them away!  Do not want to tell 2 hours - write the documentation for 3 hours - but it will remain for other colleagues. <br><br>  Sometimes these tasks are also urgent.  Give back, show, tell me how to do such tasks for at least two employees.  So you will be free from one factor distracting from important tasks, employees will learn more, learn to do something new.  If possible, automate this task if you already have an understanding of how this can be done.  But first give back - this is the time for automation. <br><br>  <b>I will write the documentation later when there is time</b> .  If you have a frequently changing project and a team of 5 people, then in this case, perhaps the documentation is too much luxury. <br>  Documentation to write for a long time and then still need to tell. <br><br>  <i>What is the problem?</i> <br><br>  When expanding the project, you will not notice how you find yourself among the few knowledge holders <s>who will</s> be asked by new employees all day long and how it works.  And the funny thing is that some of them will do it periodically, for example, once a month, when they have a problem.  It is terrible to imagine how much time many developers could save simply by writing documentation on time. <br><br>  <i>Decision:</i> <br><br>  It is necessary to write documentation, show it, and every time when they ask a question to supplement the documentation. <br><br>  If you are engaged in a big task with a lot of nuances - and on the horizon there is a need to give it away - save yourself some time - write documentation and instructions.  Yes, you will still be asked questions - complete the documentation on them.  Questions are your helpers. <br><br>  In the presence of current documentation a lot of advantages!  It facilitates the transfer of a new person to this task, allows you to give the task to more people.  Also, if suddenly you decide to change jobs tomorrow or ‚Äúgo to Tahiti and paint pictures like Gauguin‚Äù - the tasks will also be done, it will be easier for you. <br><br>  <b>Everyone is very busy, they also have no time</b> .  ‚ÄúHow can I give this task?  After all, everyone is also very busy?  and she is so boring and uninteresting, and seems to take a little time.  I'll do it myself. " <br><br>  <i>What is the problem?</i> <br><br>  That such tasks take up your precious time.  Literally precious.  For the company.  After all, your salary is probably higher than the salary of your subordinates.  So count how much the company overcharges you for this routine, for you, task. <br><br>  Second moment.  This task is routine and clear for you.  And for your employee this can be a new and interesting material.  If it becomes a routine for him, either he already has someone to donate, or it can be automated. <br><br>  <i>Decision:</i> <br><br>  As you may have guessed, the task must be given away.  To see who is right - surely there will be a person who has time for her, and for him she will be new. <br><br>  <b>Results</b> <br><br>  Delegation is a wonderful way that you can raise your level by freeing up time for new and important tasks for which it was not enough.  And at the same time, you can raise the level of your subordinates by giving them new tasks. <br><br>  When do I need to delegate?  When you already know this task as your 5 fingers and can make it even being in a state of extreme fatigue, after 1 day without sleep, intoxicated, etc. <br><br>  Why?  This task does not develop you.  Do not be greedy - give it away, it will develop another person, and you will have time for new achievements. <br><br>  When you carry everything on yourself - share your work with others.  In most cases, you can sort what you are already doing on the machine, and either automate it or give it away.  Not!  Not this way!  In any case, to give, and if you already know how, then automate it. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/317986/">https://habr.com/ru/post/317986/</a></p>
