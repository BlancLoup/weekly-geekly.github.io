Some of them are rather insignificant, for example, what kind of clothes to wear in the morning or what kind of juice to buy in the store tonight.  But there is one important decision that we cannot take on our own - the choice of which body to be born and live in.  It happens that a person lives in a body that already has multiple ailments and inevitable diseases.  Health condition is directly related to human life.  That is why the topic of health and health care has always been and remains relevant.  The industry needs constant reform and transformation. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Imagine that you do not need to wait a week to see your doctor, and then another week to get the results of medical research.  With the constant changes in demographic trends, the growth of an aging population, the demand for health services is increasing.  How can the health system be changed to better serve the population? <br><br>  The solution is the development of technology, it is through them that a new section in medicine has appeared - digital healthcare ( <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_health">digital healthcare</a> ).  The bottom line is the use of ICT in solving health problems. <br><br>  We all love to compare something, and e-medicine is no exception.  It is time to compare the level of development of domestic and electronic medicine, and of course, western.

    <h2>  Domestic projects and startups </h2><br>  It turns out that not everything is as bad as it actually is, and the development of telemedicine in our country began in parallel with the exploration of space.  These two areas were related to the fact that in order to monitor the status of astronauts, a special biotelemetric system was developed, which allows remotely receiving information about the state of the body. <br><br>  As for the present, over the past 2 years as much has happened in the field of telemedicine, how many has not been done in the past 20 years, unlike in foreign countries.  Below are some of the domestic projects aimed at helping people and their health: <br><br><ul><li>  <a href="https://i-gene.ru/">My gene</a> is a service from Russian developers for analyzing human DNA. </li><li>  <a href="http://www.bioprinting.ru/">3D Bioprinting Solutions</a> - the company is engaged in three-dimensional printing of organs and tissues of the human body. </li><li>  <a href="https://infodoctor.ru/">The information doctor</a> is a service that is able to connect the patient and the doctor of private Moscow clinics. </li><li>  <a href="https://knopka24.ru/">The life button</a> is a project that offers a medical alarm system - emergency call assistance for the elderly and disabled. </li><li>  <a href="http://pacientdoma.azurewebsites.net/">iHematologist</a> - a system that allows you to decipher a blood test. </li></ul><br>  A more detailed description is presented in the articles on the links: <a href="https://goo.gl/pjka2M">one</a> , <a href="https://goo.gl/aJoaux">two</a> , <a href="https://goo.gl/VmdT2r">three</a> . <br><br><h2>  Foreign projects and startups </h2><br>  Telemedicine in the West, namely in the EU and the USA, has existed and has been operating for 30 years, which, frankly, is hard to believe!  The history of telemedicine projects within the EU dates back to 1985.  The most important criteria for project evaluation were the standards and convenience of the systems built in use in all EU countries. <br>  The following are projects created by foreign developers who are already helping people monitor and support their health: <br><br><ul><li>  <a href="https://www.artemishealth.com/">Artemis Health</a> - Employee <a href="https://www.artemishealth.com/">Health</a> Analytics for Employers. </li><li>  <a href="http://mediquire.com/">MediQuire</a> - data analytics for medical institutions. </li><li>  <a href="https://www.touchsurgery.com/">Touch Surgery</a> - surgery solutions using 3D modeling and augmented reality. </li><li>  <a href="https://www.hioscar.com/ny">Oscar Health</a> is a portal for convenient health insurance. </li><li>  <a href="https://medisafe.com/">MediSafe</a> is a service aimed at tracking drug intake. </li><li>  <a href="http://medwand.com/index.html">MedWand</a> is a service that allows you to save patients from waiting at the offices, providing the opportunity to quickly get to the virtual reception. </li></ul><br>  More about overseas projects <a href="https://goo.gl/doxuxa">here</a> <a href="https://goo.gl/cTspW8">and here</a> . <br>  The Western market is replete with, if you can say so, various services, applications, etc.  in the field of digital medicine, which cover the full range of services.  Applications for all occasions that undoubtedly make it easier. <br><br><img src="http://radiofestival.ru/sites/default/files/uploads/main_photo/image23647.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h2>  Legislative consolidation in Russia </h2><br>  The development of e-medicine in our country is in full swing, however, the consolidation of all innovations in the legislative system is not fast enough.  It is possible that in our country they are cautious when new technologies, developments and, in principle, everything new, and the state is not particularly in a hurry to support the development of information technologies, although it should go by leaps and bounds towards the development of electronic medicine and its consolidation in the daily life of any person, regardless of whether he lives in a metropolis or in a provincial town. <br><br>  The Ministry of Health has been asked to build an e-health system.  The project presents the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãcreating a single electronic case history for the whole country, a ‚Äúbirth history‚Äù, an outpatient card - all on the basis of cloud technologies.  Archives of radiographs and ultrasound, CT and MRI data are also planned to be transferred to electronic form.  The text of the project can be found at the <a href="https://goo.gl/pdy7ew">link</a> . <br><br><h2>  Legislative consolidation in the West </h2><br>  Legal regulation of telemedicine in Western countries is not uncommon and has been practiced for a long time.  As you can guess, one of the most legal states is the <a href="http://evercare.ru/telemedicine-regulations-in-usa">United States</a> , which has developed its own laws for telemedicine.  Formation of laws in the field of telemedicine was the creation of the following laws: <br><br><ul><li>  The Balanced Budget Act of 1997; </li><li>  The Benefits Improvement and Protection Act of 2000; </li><li>  The Law on Health Information Protection Technologies in Economics and Medicine (HITECH Act) of 2009. </li></ul><br>  It is also worth noting that in different states of the country their own, separate laws regulating telemedicine are approved.  Thus, the Minnesota law of 1999 states that among the technical tools used in television consultations, interactive videos and other latest technologies can be used. <br><br>  Financing e-medicine in the <a href="https://goo.gl/vmPf9o">UK</a> <br><br><h2>  Dry total </h2><br>  If we compare the projects of Russian and foreign developers, the gap between the first and second is immediately striking, and not in our favor.  Many Russian projects are an analogue of foreign services that are adapted to our realities.  We are in favor of our scientists and developers creating their own unique projects, start-ups, which will be ‚Äústolen‚Äù by their Western colleagues.  Russia has a huge potential in the development of digital health care.  It is necessary to consolidate e-medicine at the legislative level, train medical personnel in computer technologies, finance start-ups related to medicine in IT.  We conquered <a href="https://topspb.tv/news/2017/12/10/chlen-ekipazha-mks-razmestil-snimok-severnogo-siyaniya-s-kosmosa/">space</a> , obey and e-health, if not us, then who?
