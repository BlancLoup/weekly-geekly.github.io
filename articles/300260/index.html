A brand advertising campaign promotes the promotion of a brand and, consequently, an increase in revenues from sales of goods or services under the name or logo used.  Therefore, it is necessary to carefully select the optimal type of Internet traffic for such an advertising campaign. <br><br><h5>  Introduction </h5><br>  Brand advertising is usually used in cases when it is necessary to introduce a new brand to the market, give the buyer information about the existence of such a brand, give him an idea that the product he saw in the store has a ‚Äúname‚Äù and not be produced by an ‚Äúunderground company‚Äù ".  Or to achieve an increase in sales on a long-term basis, that is, to achieve not a short-term demand for a product or service, but a stable leadership in one or another market.  It also makes sense to conduct a branded advertising campaign to maintain customer loyalty to a particular brand or company, that is, to remind consumers of the existence of a particular brand, so that when a customer needs a product, his visual memory inspired him to purchase the product of that particular brand. who dazzled before his eyes for a long time. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h5>  Types of Internet traffic </h5><br>  In order to promote a brand on the Internet, it is necessary to analyze the site where the brand will unwind, to consider each method of promotion on the Internet to determine the optimal type of traffic for the brand‚Äôs advertising campaign. <br><br>  There are the following types of traffic on the Internet with which you can make advertising promotion of the brand.

      Display advertising is a type of advertising focused on audience perception.  It is developed using special techniques to attract the attention of readers and may include text, a company logo, photographs and other images.  Of course, at first glance, such a method for promotion is preferable, because in order to promote a brand, it is necessary to attract the attention of users, however, varieties must be considered separately.  In this article we will look at the following types of medicine advertising: Banner advertising, Text link, PopUnder advertising. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/cdf/09f/0b6/cdf09f0b633f47ec9923322138f48fcb.jpg"><br>  Figure 1 - Example of display advertising <br><br>  <b>Banner advertising</b> - a banner is a block with a graphic image, when clicked, the user goes to the advertised resource.  Banners are placed on sites with high traffic and indicate a link to the site being promoted. <br><br>  Using banners to promote a brand is quite effective even now, when using banners to attract customers to the site is an outdated way of using traffic, since users often find banner ads to be annoying and try to ignore it.  However, visual memory can still put information about a particular brand in the mind of a potential buyer.  Therefore, the use of banner advertising as Internet traffic for a brand advertising campaign is taking place. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/4d7/3e9/39d/4d73e939d6b94217a853cac15789578e.jpg"><br>  Figure 2 - An example of banner advertising brand products <br><br>  <b>A text link</b> is a link located at the end of a text paragraph, used, as a rule, with the expectation that the user will click on it and will receive information about the brand on the site.  This method of brand promotion is extremely inefficient, since few people will be interested in following the link with the name of an unknown company, and the name read on the website is unlikely to be stored in the buyer's head. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f61/aaf/012/f61aaf01226c4949bda1e06d48f8d18d.jpg"><br>  Figure 3 - Example of text advertising brand products <br><br>  <b>PopUnder advertising</b> is a banner that sometimes opens behind the main browser window or on top of the main site that the user has switched to.  Most users have seen this type of advertising, and often, when you click the Close button, a new, even larger banner appears.  This way of promoting the brand also has the name backscreen.  The effectiveness of this method of traffic to promote a brand is a good way to attract the attention of the network user, but at the same time, this type of advertising can create a negative attitude to the brand due to too aggressive way to promote it. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d2b/4bb/ea5/d2b4bbea5106440698be4b06dd837607.jpg"><br>  Figure 4 - Example of PopUnder advertising brand products <br><br>  <b>Contextual advertising</b> is a type of Internet advertising, in which an advertisement is displayed in accordance with the content, context of a web page.  Of course, you can promote the brand in this way, but first and foremost, such advertising is aimed at attracting customers "here and now." <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a53/a29/e82/a53a29e8262549d7b5a0060095580984.jpg"><br>  Figure 5 - Example contextual advertising brand products <br><br>  <b>Thematic sites</b> are sites that have been tested and which search sites have given the right to advertise their clients.  This way of promoting a brand is a good way of promoting a brand, but for its implementation it is necessary to meet certain parameters in order to conclude an agreement with search sites. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/48e/077/050/48e077050e6145b1944954588303e9b0.jpg"><br>  Figure 6 - An example of thematic advertising <br><br>  <b>Video clips on video-community sites</b> (YouTube, RuTube, IVI, Yandex.Video and others) and large video platforms where brand video advertising can be made before playing a video or watching.  The most convenient system for using video advertising is Google AdWords, with its help it is possible to track and analyze point statistics on views of running videos. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/329/774/2d8/3297742d81e6423eb0585956b855fff3.jpg"><br>  Figure 7 - An example of brand advertising before the video <br><br>  <b>Social networks and publics</b> - another type of intrnet traffic when conducting a brand advertising campaign, may be creating publics on social networks, such as Vkontakte or Facebook, by promoting the public, thereby promoting the brand.  Users who are in public with a large number of participants will consider this a symbol of brand recognition, and therefore the brand in their eyes will be of high quality and reliable. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d2f/450/b80/d2f450b8070f4e25b984fc327e6d1d3a.jpg"><br>  Figure 8 - An example of brand advertising through public on social networks <br><br>  <b>Ezine</b> advertising - brand advertising via e-mail newsletter.  This type of Internet traffic is extremely inefficient when conducting a brand advertising campaign, since a subscription requires a user to subscribe, if he is subscribed to the brand‚Äôs website, then the newsletter is unlikely to change his opinion about the brand, and making advertising of another brand is not in the rules market relations.  It is also impossible to promote a brand new brand from scratch with this type of advertising, as sending out advertising of such a brand will be considered as spam.  SPAM is considered sending letters to E-mail addresses of users who did not give their consent, to receive correspondence.  Unauthorized sending (SPAM) is a prohibited type of traffic. <br><br><h5>  Analysis of the advantages and disadvantages of various types of Internet traffic. </h5><br><br>  So, we will analyze the considered options. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/694/9fa/12c/6949fa12c58a4624832b003d8d6e4545.JPG"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/862/24c/518/86224c5180434f6fbc6541127aa59be9.JPG"><br><br><h5>  Conclusions of the analysis </h5><br><br>  Based on the analysis of the types of Internet traffic, we can conclude that the best way to use traffic when conducting a brand advertising campaign will be advertising through videos.  This way of an advertising campaign will be accurately noticed by users, and if the video sequence is executed correctly, the advertised brand will surely fit into the user's memory.  The only negative factor in such a campaign is its high cost.  An alternative way to conduct a brand advertising campaign is to keep the public in the social network in social networks, this will bring a large number of positive factors to the brand.  However, this type of Internet traffic will be successful only in conjunction with other, for example, targeted advertising on a social network.  The use of Internet traffic as a media banner advertising can also bear fruit.  Other types of advertising Internet traffic when conducting a brand advertising campaign are ineffective or ineffective in principle. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/300260/">https://habr.com/ru/post/300260/</a></p>
