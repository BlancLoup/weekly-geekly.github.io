  <section class="page js-page"><h1>12 simple rules so as not to degrade in freelancing</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Freelance is often blamed for the fact that it is a dead end in the development of a specialist (often freelance programmers are often set as examples). <br><br>  Like, it all comes down to solving the same type of non-complex tasks, and complex tasks do not trust in freelancing.  Such conclusions can be read in almost any discussion of freelancing and not from one person. <br><br>  That is why I would like to raise this topic once again today and give a list of my tips on what a freelancer needs to do so that he constantly moves forward, instead of marking time and degrading.  In other words - how not to get bogged down in the routine of monotonous and small projects. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  I‚Äôll say right away that there are complex projects in freelance, only a large part of them never laid out in open form on exchanges, etc.  They immediately come to the right hands, to trusted freelancers.  The main problem on this day in freelancing is that the qualification of most freelancers simply physically and technically does not allow them to ‚Äúswallow‚Äù a complex project and, naturally, they don‚Äôt trust the project to such people.  For truly professional performers, there are orders, there have been and will be - this is an axiom. And in freelancing, it is even easier for professionals to stand out against the background of most freelancers.

      I agree with the opinion that if a freelancer doesn‚Äôt develop, but only earns money, sooner or later it will lead him to a dead end when he will have a hard time getting a job, since the payment will be much less than his earnings in freelancing and progress freelance it is not. <br><br>  So, without delay, my advice for freelance programmers: <br><ol><li>  <strong>Before the start.</strong>  Do not go to freelance not working for 1-2 years in teams in the office.  Without an understanding of the process of working in teams - the development of a specialist is out of the question (further I will explain why) </li><li>  <strong>At the beginning of the journey.</strong>  For the first six months, you will need to work on reputation, then to be able to set prices higher, relying on reputation and experience. </li><li>  <strong>Filter projects.</strong>  As soon as you have a reputation - do not touch everything, for which they simply pay a lot of money.  Try to take the project every time in a more complicated, more interesting way, so that, say, 25% of this project you do not know how to do, so that you have to break your head, look for solutions </li><li>  <strong>New information.</strong>  2-3 hours a day, pay for self-education in the profile field </li><li>  <strong>Experience exchange.</strong>  Try as often as possible to work in a team with other people from your area - this is important for sharing experiences.  This is where the experience of working in a team in offices is useful - many things in one form or another are used in remote working conditions </li><li>  <strong>Do not allow stagnation.</strong>  Advance in your knowledge, try to go up a step - in one project to act as a performer, in another - as a manager (get good experience working with people and customers) or a database designer </li><li>  <strong>New items</strong>  Be interested in new products in your area - try to ‚Äútouch‚Äù them yourself, whatever the cost to you - for this you have to earn enough (hello again freelancer reputation) to have access to new technologies </li><li>  <strong>Observe the mode.</strong>  Do not work a day for more than 6 hours - it is detrimental to your health.  6 hours a day is enough for work </li><li>  <strong>Relaxation.</strong>  Rest more so that the brain is ready to master new things almost every day. </li><li>  <strong>Reality.</strong>  From time to time I advise you to take up work on any project where the employer needs your presence in his office with his team.  You can even independently offer this type of project cooperation in the top offices of your city.  A sort of exit freelance.  Very useful for sharing experience with office colleagues and getting new knowledge. </li><li>  <strong>Goals</strong>  Set goals for the month, year, two years in advance and move towards their achievement.  An excellent goal can be both the launch of your project, and the development of business English </li><li>  <strong>Future.</strong>  Never rest on your laurels - go further, deeper.  Decide who you want to be in 5 years, let's say, and go towards this goal. </li></ol><br>  The rules are quite simple, almost all of them are very simply projected onto any area of ‚Äã‚Äãfreelancing and work not only in the field of programming in freelancing. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/26791/">https://habr.com/ru/post/26791/</a></p>
