      A car for a professional driver is practically a second home.  And for the trucker - in particular, since he spends most of his life on the road.  If you think about this figure, it becomes clear why so much attention is paid to the choice of the machine, its external style, ease of operation, arrangement and interior of the cabin. <br>  Naturally, in ‚ÄúTruckers 3‚Äù we tried to convey the possibilities of truck selection and tuning as accurately as possible, so in this article we will talk about three licensed brands of truck tractors represented in the game: Freightliner, Western Star and Sterling. <br>  To begin with, we define the terms: <br><br>  <i><b>Truck tractor</b></i> is a self-propelled transport vehicle designed to tow semi-trailers attached to the machine using a special coupling mechanism - a saddle. <br><br>  <i><b>A semi</b></i> - <i><b>trailer</b></i> is a vehicle without an engine, intended for the carriage of goods and equipped for coupling with a tractor in such a way that a significant part of the load is transmitted to the rear wheels of the tractor. <br><br><img src="http://games.cnews.ru/trophy/screens/ring_n_roll3_exclusive/aaa.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <i><b>The main truck tractor</b></i> (namely, truckers work for them) is designed to transport cargo on roads with artificial turf. <br><br><h5>  <b>Freightliner</b> </h5><br><br>  The history of Freightliner began back in 1929, when the young driver James Leland registered the company Consolidated Freight Lines.  Initially, James did not position his company as an industrial truck manufacturer.  Strangely enough, he planned to engage in conventional transportation, and he was ready to share the ideas of new designs with any automotive corporation.  True, no one responded to Leland‚Äôs proposals. <br>  In the same year, Consolidated Freight Lines engineers decided to independently undertake the reconstruction of the trucks at their disposal.  It was these experiments that led to the introduction of a number of innovations, such as the use of aluminum in brake pads and the casing of the van.  In general, the company's employees have brought many innovations to the industry, one of which is familiar to anyone interested in trucks.  This, of course, is about COE (cab over engine) - the cabin above the engine.  The fact is that in the USA such characteristics of a cargo vehicle as weight and overall length of a train were legally regulated.  Thus, thanks to the shortened cab, it became possible to attach longer trailers to the towing vehicle and, accordingly, to transport more cargo. <br><br>  Until 1940, James did not dare to undertake the commercial production of his tractor, but he teamed up with five more transport companies for the mass production of cars for personal purposes.  Leland renames the company Consolidated Freightways, and the newly formed union gets the proud name of Freightways Company Inc. <br><br>  Closer to World War II, the formation of the Consolidated Freightways as an automaker began.  This happened when the company for the first time delivered its production units to another concern for the operational assembly of tractors.  A little later, Vice President Tom Taylor said that Consolidated Freightways intends to engage in commercial production itself, as it is able to do it more quickly, and most importantly - with high quality. <br>  By 1942, the company is assigned the final name - Freightliner Corporation.  By this time, several trucks have already been released with a new emblem on the radiators.  The last years of the war were a difficult time for the company, since, unlike many competitors, it was not easy for it to rebuild its plants for the needs of the front.  However, over the next few years, the corporation rises abruptly thanks to the competent commercial policies of Vice President Lester Kassebaum.  Later, Freightliner Corporation will receive an order for trucks with a sleeping compartment (slipper).  The idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe sleeper belongs to another major manufacturer, but its introduction into trucks under the Freightliner brand helped the new decision to be settled on the market and survive to this day. <br>  The company was doing excellently, truck sales were growing, new models were being produced ... however, something was not enough for a larger development.  The possibility of a long-awaited expansion appeared in the early 1980s, when the European player, Daimler-Benz, promoted the Mercedes-Benz tractors to the American market.  The group buys from the Consolidated Freightways division of Freightliner and supplies it with all the necessary resources, receiving in return the name known in the American market. <br><br>  In 1997, Freightliner redeems a whole long-haul unit from Ford and renames it Sterling.  And in 2000, the transaction is completed on the acquisition of another well-known manufacturer - Western Star. <br><br><h4>  <b>Classic XL</b> </h4><br><br>  The classic Freightliner tractor series combines austere design and modern technology.  For many years, Freightliner Classic XL has been among the winners of The Truck Show.  The original and strict design of the cars in this series still arouses the admiration of not only professional drivers, but also ordinary visitors to the exhibition.  Classic XL is a unique car, the longest among its classic counterparts - the distance from the bumper to the rear wall of a standard cab is 132 inches (3330 mm). <br><br><img src="http://games.cnews.ru/trophy/screens/ring_n_roll3_exclusive/aab.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The cabin is made of aluminum alloy, which provides greater carrying capacity and fuel economy.  The basic concepts of such trucks were developed by the company in difficult times for the American automotive industry, when oil prices rose sharply, with the result that many market participants lost ground, failing to meet the new requirements of the customer. <br><br><img src="http://games.cnews.ru/trophy/screens/ring_n_roll3_exclusive/aac.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The interior of the cab has also earned the highest accolades from many drivers.  It's easy to explain.  Freightliner Classic is available in two versions - day-cab (day cabin, without sleeping bag) and sleeper box (sleeping compartment with height from 48 to 84 inches *).  Thus, everyone can choose the appropriate version of the tractor, taking into account the desired amount of available space.  In "Truckers 3", a variant with a "slipper" is presented, since transportation takes place all over the state, and such a journey can take several days.  Of course, the game will have to spend the night in motels, after all, this is exactly what truckers in the US are doing now, but still trucks must meet the requirements of transport companies. <br>  In addition, the sleeping compartment has an air conditioning system and even a TV stand.  The walls of the cabin trimmed with vinyl panels. <br><br><img src="http://games.cnews.ru/trophy/screens/ring_n_roll3_exclusive/aad.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  In the Freightliner Classic XL, the driver‚Äôs seat is very spacious and ergonomic.  Especially for convenience, the right side of the dashboard is slightly curved towards the driver, which creates a feeling of a more compact workplace, where everything is at hand.  The factory version of the panel is made "under the tree" and resembles expensive furniture. <br><br><img src="http://games.cnews.ru/trophy/screens/ring_n_roll3_exclusive/aae.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Despite the large size and slightly angular shape, Classic XL creates a feeling of luxury and comfort, which sometimes lacks the tracks of competitors who have forgotten how important a car is for its owner. <br><br><h4>  <b>Century class</b> </h4><br><br>  The first truck Freightliner, released after the transition under the management of the concern Daimler-Benz.  Its very name Century - translated into Russian "century", "century" - already says a lot.  This is a kind of challenge not only to competitors, but also to time, because this model was born in 1995 and personified the achievements with which Freightliner was going to enter the 21st century.  Engineers are constantly engaged in improving the design of the tractor, which created such a convenient and fault-tolerant transport that in 1999 Freightliner Century received a special designation S / T (Safety / Technology), symbolizing safety and manufacturability. <br><br><img src="http://games.cnews.ru/trophy/screens/ring_n_roll3_exclusive/aaf.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The main "chips" Century are self-adjusting clutch and special aerodynamics of the hood.  The second allows to significantly reduce fuel consumption, due to the decrease in the level of resistance.  For the same purpose, a special grille has been developed, which increases the air flow and contributes to more efficient cooling. <br><br><img src="http://games.cnews.ru/trophy/screens/ring_n_roll3_exclusive/aag.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The cab is made of lightweight and durable materials, and the vibration and vibration control system, isolating the driver from extraneous noise, makes the ride in the Freightliner Century Class S / T quiet and peaceful. <br><br>  Among the high-tech "stuffing" of the tractor, you can select the Driver Information Center driver information system, which is an on-board computer that warns the driver in time about the level of fluids, equipment malfunctions and much more. <br><br><img src="http://games.cnews.ru/trophy/screens/ring_n_roll3_exclusive/aah.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  In Freightliner Century Class has a number of features.  For example, the bumper consists of two parts: the central steel and side plastic.  Thanks to this approach, in the event of a collision, the amount of total damage to the car is reduced, and subsequent repairs will be much cheaper. <br><br><img src="http://games.cnews.ru/trophy/screens/ring_n_roll3_exclusive/aai.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The angle of rotation of the front wheels is 50 degrees, which allows you to more clearly maneuver when reversing and has a positive effect on the handling of the truck as a whole. <br><br><img src="http://games.cnews.ru/trophy/screens/ring_n_roll3_exclusive/aaj.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Curved windshield consists of two parts.  This technique, by analogy with the bumper, is designed to reduce costs in case of damage. <br>  Special mention deserves a special level of security.  For example, the Roll Stability Control system (‚Äústability control‚Äù) helps to cope with the control during a skid by braking and reducing power, and the Roll Stability Advisor (‚ÄúStability Advisor‚Äù) warns the driver about a possible skid. <br>  In general, the Freightliner Century Class S / T became the first American truck of class 8, which meets the requirements of the Swedish and European crash tests ECE R-29 (if not surpasses them).  It can be said that this is one of the most reliable long haul trucks in the world. <br><br><h4>  <b>Coronado</b> </h4><br><br>  The Coronado is the most powerful tractor with the 8th class engine in the Freightliner line, combining the best features of the Classic XL and FLD 120SD.  Thanks to a large radiator and a long hood, every diesel engine of the 8th class with a capacity from 425 to 600 hp fits into the Coronado.  with Jake Brake function (engine braking). <br><br><img src="http://games.cnews.ru/trophy/screens/ring_n_roll3_exclusive/aak.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The cab and some internal elements are made of aluminum to reduce the weight of the tractor and increase its payload. <br><br><img src="http://games.cnews.ru/trophy/screens/ring_n_roll3_exclusive/aal.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The dashboard resembles the panel of the Classic XL: its right-hand side is also curved, which allows you to keep all the main controls and indicators in sight.  Once again, the designers designed the inside of the cabin with a certain amount of luxury: the dashboard is decorated with elements of Oregon Burl wood, the steering wheel is made in VIP-style, it has chrome-plated needles with leather and wooden trim. <br><br><img src="http://games.cnews.ru/trophy/screens/ring_n_roll3_exclusive/aam.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The front wheels of the Freightliner Coronado rotate at a 50 degree angle, which provides excellent maneuverability in confined spaces and heavy traffic. <br><br><img src="http://games.cnews.ru/trophy/screens/ring_n_roll3_exclusive/aan.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Thanks to the chrome-plated bumper on the outside, the cabin is well protected from damage.  The design is most aimed at reducing costs in the event of an accident or other incidents, so the wings of the machine can be replaced separately. <br><br><h4>  <b>Argosy</b> </h4><br><br>  Argosy is named in honor of the ancient Greek pioneer ship "Argo".  Freightliner, the youngest, was born in 1998.  More than $ 70 million was spent on development, but admittedly, it was worth it.  Argosy has not only a unique design, but also excellent technical characteristics.  For example, its stability and controllability are not affected by an increase in the total load.  In addition, Freightliner engineers have not forgotten about comfort for the driver, having solved the problem of landing in the cab: the driver and passenger sides have steps that move forward when you open the doors and slide in when closed. <br><br><img src="http://games.cnews.ru/trophy/screens/ring_n_roll3_exclusive/aao.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  In the Freightliner Argosy model, many improvements were implemented that were prepared for other models, but were not implemented for various reasons.  These include, for example, a thermal insulation partition between the engine and the driver's cabin, which was designed for the Century Class.  Of course, the most noteworthy in the ‚ÄúBig Merchant Ship‚Äù (and this is what Argosy translates to) is the absence of a long bonnet inherent in many mainline tractors, as well as the ‚Äúfreighliners‚Äù themselves.  In this model, the engine is where it belongs, behind the grille under the driver‚Äôs seat.  Thanks to this solution, the cabin design has become more reliable (SAE standards ** exceeded). <br>  Argosy stands out for its ability to maneuver.  Thanks to the angle of rotation of the wheels (50 degrees) and the distance between the center of the front axle and the bumper (40 inches), improved weight transfer is ensured. <br>  The internal structure of the cabin has also undergone a number of changes, although the dashboard, according to the established tradition, is curved.  Elements located on the panel have become larger, all are highlighted.  The driver information system now works in conjunction with a ‚ÄúData Logging Unit‚Äù (DLU), allowing you to receive and record fault messages.  Then this data can be easily transferred to a regular computer and determine the cause of the problem. <br><br><img src="http://games.cnews.ru/trophy/screens/ring_n_roll3_exclusive/aap.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h5>  <b>Sterling</b> </h5><br><br>  The history of the brand Sterling is not as rich as that of Freightliner.  The most interesting fact is probably the presence of five different enterprises with the name Sterling.  And they were created at different times, by different people, but all in the automotive field.  However, at the moment there is one manufacturer in the world called Sterling, which, as mentioned above, is the former Ford cargo division bought out in 1999 by Freightliner. <br><br><h4>  <b>A9500S</b> </h4><br>  Heavy main tractors are represented by several modifications with the A9500 index, which differ in many technical parameters (make and engine power, type of gearbox, suspension design, dimensions and type of sleeping compartment).  The undisputed flagship of the A9500 series is the Silver Star model.  The Silver Star, a powerful, reliable, easy-to-use, comfortable and truly beautiful car, contains all the best practices of Sterling.  This is a typical American truck, designed to transport goods over long distances, designed and equipped so as to make the driver feel at home.  True, the basic equipment of the tractor does not spoil the buyer.  Standard equipment includes only side lights on the roof and an air purifier.  But for an additional fee, Sterling 9500 is overgrown with many additional devices, such as an improved aerodynamic package and others. <br><br><img src="http://games.cnews.ru/trophy/screens/ring_n_roll3_exclusive/aaq.jpg" alt="image"><br><img src="http://games.cnews.ru/trophy/screens/ring_n_roll3_exclusive/aar.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Sterling 9500 is available in two wheel formulas - 4x2 and 6x4.  The game presented the second option.  Its weight is 30 tons. <br><br><img src="http://games.cnews.ru/trophy/screens/ring_n_roll3_exclusive/aas.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h5>  <b>Western star</b> </h5><br><br>  Unlike most other North American truck manufacturers, Western Star is a relatively young company - it was formed in 1967 and quite quickly managed to gain a foothold in the market, producing a number of models of heavy trucks for various purposes (road and special).  Initially, the assembly of machines was carried out at a plant in the Canadian province of British Columbia, and at the beginning of this century - after the company became part of the Freightliner concern - production moved to Portland (Oregon). <br><br><h4>  <b>4900EX LowMax</b> </h4><br><br>  The star carrier is rightly considered to be the EX 4900 mainline tractor, which is mainly intended for truckers who prefer classic cars.  Since 2002, the Western Star EX 4900 has been produced in a LowMax modification, which has a sleeping height of almost a whole foot (0.3 m) lower than that of standard models. <br><br><img src="http://games.cnews.ru/trophy/screens/ring_n_roll3_exclusive/aat.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  LowMax seems to be pressed to the road, resembling a racing car, but at the same time retains all the charm that is inherent in the classic models of American cars. <br><br><img src="http://games.cnews.ru/trophy/screens/ring_n_roll3_exclusive/aau.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The center of gravity of this machine is very low, which gives it greater stability and controllability and makes it ideally suitable for towing trailers with a highly raised center of gravity ‚Äî car transporters, grain hoppers, cattle trucks ‚Äî as well as for transporting marine yachts. <br><br>  * 121‚Äì212 cm <br>  ** Community of Automotive Engineers (English Society of Automobile Engineers, SAE) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/70284/">https://habr.com/ru/post/70284/</a></p>
