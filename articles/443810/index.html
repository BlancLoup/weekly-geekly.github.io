      From the picture of each box plot chart you can go to its interactive version, where it will be easier to orient in numbers. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br><hr><br><h3>  Salary of developers of different languages ‚Äã‚Äãin general </h3><br>  To start, look at the salaries of developers for programming languages ‚Äã‚Äãin general.  The highest median salaries of developers in languages: Scala - 150,000 rubles., Elixir - 143,000 rubles., Go - 140,000 rubles.  and Objective-C and Swift - 120,000 rubles. <br><br> <a href="https://moikrug.ru/user_graphs/274"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a85/df8/2a9/a85df82a9d5e3545bed4bb23fa857e64.png"></a> <br><br><h3>  Salary of developers of different qualifications in general </h3><br>  Now let's see how the salaries of developers of different qualifications in general differ, without breaking down into programming languages. <br><br>  Starting with an intern with a salary of 26,000 rubles.  On average, the salary of each of the following qualifications grows as follows: June - 1.7 times (45,000 rubles), Middle - 1.9 (85,000 rubles), Senor - 1.6 (140,000 rubles), Lead - 1.1 times (160 000 rub.). <br><br>  The lead salary in the development as a whole is 3.5 times the juna's salary. <br><br> <a href="https://moikrug.ru/user_graphs/275"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/020/348/b29/020348b2900f405a6743895c292ab36a.png"></a> <br><br>  We see how much different salaries of different qualifications differ: it will be useful to compare these salaries with the average median salary with which we usually operate.  Next, we will look at the salaries of developers of different qualifications in each language separately. <br><br><h3>  Salary of developers of different qualifications by language </h3><br>  Salaries for interns in different languages ‚Äã‚Äãrange from 20,000 to 30,000 rubles. <br><br>  Juns have a salary of approximately 40,000 to 50,000 rubles.  in most languages.  The exceptions are Ruby and Swift, and especially Objective-C, in which the salaries of jun are 60,000 and 80,000 rubles.  accordingly, which is close to the wages of the middle languages ‚Äã‚Äãin other languages. <br><br>  Midl salaries range from 70,000 to 110,000 rubles. <br><br>  Seniors have a salary of 120,000 to 150,000 rubles.  in most languages.  The exceptions are Ruby, Objective-C and Go, in which seniors' salaries are 170,000 rubles, which is close to the salaries of leads in other languages.  As well as 1C, in which seniors salary is 100,000 rubles.  close to wages in other languages <br><br>  Leads have salaries ranging from 150,000 to 185,000 rubles.  The exception is 1C, in which the salary of leads is 120,000 rubles.  close to seniors salaries in other languages. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/24b/fd7/19a/24bfd719a7c4d43b892ea42c734e5b78.png"><br>  In general, in all languages ‚Äã‚Äãa general pattern can be traced: with the growth of qualification, the jump to the next level of salary gradually decreases.  From Jun to Middle, the leap is the largest, from Middle to Senor ‚Äî already smaller, and from Senor to Lid, quite small.  As we saw at the beginning, these steps on average are: 1.9, 1.6 and 1.1, respectively.  In this case there are exceptions: the most notable are the languages ‚Äã‚Äãof Ruby and Objective-C.  Here the jump from juna to middle is less than from middle to lord. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/643/e98/060/643e98060c3481cc83bea94402448f65.png"><br>  It is curious to compare the maximum career step in each language.  As we saw at the beginning, on average, the lead salary is 3.5 times the June salary.  At the same time, the largest gap between these points is for Kotlin developers, it is 4.4 times.  And the smallest one is at Objective-C developers and it is 2.3 times.  In the latter, this is obviously due to the highest salaries of the juns, compared with other languages. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/44b/5e3/8ef/44b5e38efc74a6d918eb2ec3bf766bc8.png"><br><br><hr><br>  Next, we will look in more detail on the diagrams with a mustache (box plot), how salaries of developers working with the same language but having different qualifications differ.  We will show only those languages ‚Äã‚Äãand qualifications for which we have collected enough data. <br><br>  Dots indicate specific salaries.  The central vertical line shows the median salary (half salaries are lower, and half higher than this point, this salary can be considered average), the box borders are 25 and 75 percents (divide the lower and upper half of salaries once again in half, as a result, half of all salaries are between them).  The box's mustache is 10 and 90 percentile (it is conditionally possible to consider their minimum and maximum salaries). <br><br><h4>  Salary Go Developers </h4><br>  The median Go of developers in general is 140,000 rubles. <br><br>  Starting from June with a salary of 50,000 rubles.  on average, the salary of each of the following qualifications grows as follows: middle -
