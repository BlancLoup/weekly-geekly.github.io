  <section class="page js-page"><h1>SMS against the "green snake"</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  On Wednesday, a press conference was held at the Interfax office, organized by the Rosspirtprom information and external relations department, where a presentation was held on the presentation of the authentication system for the alcohol giant products of the Moscow Kristall plant.  With a serious problem of dominance on the counters of fake stores, which means, at best, low-quality, or simply toxic vodka, the flagship of the industry is going to fight quite in the spirit of the times - with the help of SMS and the Internet. <br><br>  Now every buyer of vodka under the brand MZK will be able to verify its authenticity by sending a short message with a digital code printed on a sticker pasted on the bottle neck to a special number.  In case the bottle really came out of the factory conveyor, within a minute the customer‚Äôs answer will come to the phone with the word ‚ÄúCrystal‚Äù.  If the code does not appear in the manufacturer‚Äôs database, the answer will contain the word ‚ÄúCounterfeit‚Äù.  For the same purpose, a <a href="http://new.kristall.ru/check.html">page</a> is available on the website of the MSC. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  According <a href="http://interfax.ru/r/B/pcreport/15.html%3Fid_issue%3D11856090">to</a> Dmitry Dobrov, a representative of Rosspirtprom, a suspicious bottle of unknown origin should be handed over to the plant laboratory for examination and, on the basis of its results, boldly sue the unfair seller.  Starting from Wednesday, stickers with a code will protect Samokatnaya vodka, and by the end of the year, about half of all Kristall's products.  The special technology of applying the sticker eliminates its reuse: it breaks when you unscrew the lid, so pouring the "Palen" into the original container will not work. <br><br>  The SMS service was taken over by MTS.  As the press secretary of the company, Irina Osadchaya, told us, this system has taken a worthy place among the many other content projects being implemented together with Mobile TeleSystems partners.  No proposals for such cooperation from other enterprises in the industry have yet been received.

      Interestingly, the Moscow plant is no longer a pioneer in the use of such systems in Russia.  After testing in May of this year, starting in June, all the products of the Rostov Capital Yuzhnaya Vodka Distillery from the lower and middle price ranges go to the stores of the Southern Federal District under the protection of a ‚ÄúQuality Mark‚Äù sticker with a digital code and manufacturer authentication instructions using SMS.  However, despite the similarities in the basic idea, this new system differs in a number of important moments.  First, the digital code here is not hidden under the layer to be erased, like on Crystal bottles, and it is possible to check what you buy before you make a purchase.  And secondly, the cost of servicing the service is partially borne by the buyer himself, paying for the request at a slightly higher rate than an ordinary SMS. <br><br>  The cost of introducing stickers for gluing stickers to the production line in both cases is minimal, as the equipment used to apply special marks canceled in 2006, which were also applied to the bottle cap, preventing its illegal reuse, remained. <br><br>  According to Ekaterina Paniotova, head of marketing at the Regatta group of companies, which includes the Yuzhnaya Stolitsa plant, the main effect of using such a system is customer satisfaction.  Buying products familiar to them, they can be sure that they are buying exactly what the label promises.  The demand for such an SMS service is evidenced by the constant increase in the number of calls to the system by 10-15% per month. <br><br>  Commenting on the appeal of the Kristall plant to this practice of additional consumer protection against counterfeit goods, Ekaterina noted that this is ‚Äúthe right move, so we, the producers of high-quality alcohol, unite in the fight against an illegal product.‚Äù <br><br>  Today, when, fortunately, the overwhelming majority of the population is provided with cellular communication and, unfortunately, is increasingly at risk of forgetting about this and other joys of life due to fake alcohol, the introduction of such systems is absolutely necessary and reasonable.  And in the case of the successful experience of Kristall, one can almost certainly expect new stickers to appear on the products of other enterprises, especially state-owned ones. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/14066/">https://habr.com/ru/post/14066/</a></p>
