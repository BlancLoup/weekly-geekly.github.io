The situation is quite standard and developing under the standard scenario. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  You need:

      CMS, written so that even the new office manager can easily understand how and what to do to add a section or article. <br><br>  The design is such that even from a mobile phone or tablet, the user can see everything that the company offers him.  Attractive user-friendly design. <br><br>  The user's account, allowing you to see what he was already doing on the site, where he went and what he was interested in.  Standard solution for a standard company website. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f0a/139/ca6/f0a139ca6239fcdabf1fcdad4abb73e8.gif"><br><br>  But if you think about it, then why not connect to the creation of the site at least at the level of writing TK Marketing.  After all, he is engaged in the development of the project.  Marketers create activity and turn the site into a site that leads customers.  Agree, it sounds reasonable.  Let us have a <b>marketer</b> . <br><br>  <b>SEOshnik</b> here, too, would not interfere.  He has to work out the project structure.  Make it a reference for the search engine.  To register meta tags, to work out the system of cross internal links. <br><br>  <b>IT</b> company in the project is also the right person.  At the level of writing TK, he has nothing to do, but to control the ‚Äúpurity‚Äù of the code and the literacy of the architecture of the project is clearly his job. <br><br>  So you gather a team and turn your website into a unique project that has only an indirect relation to the standard you have planned.  Let's try to imagine the TK, written as a result of such TeamWork. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/2cf/d75/de6/2cfd75de66c2a0bc0f4f54fa52f822d5.gif"><br><br><h5>  So, what would she want? </h5><br><br>  First, the fields for meta tags.  They should be obligatory for each material, section and in general any element containing content. <br>  Then he will clearly intervene in the work of the designer, analyzing a couple of dozen top sites, thus highlighting the areas of attention of users and insisting on the placement in these areas of the main elements containing keywords.  For example, dynamically updated news catalogs or a list of key sections of the site, menu modules. <br><br>  Since SEO is based on statistics of user behavior, he immediately warns the designer and IT specialist that after the launch he will insist on changing the locations of certain modules.  It turns out that the site will start and then immediately receive a redesign, in the name of improved usability and S.  However, it is necessary to understand that the SEShochnik can turn around very cool if you let him in to create a project and therefore Aytishnik and the Marketer have to control his insatiable energy.  Otherwise, it may happen that the site simply loses ‚Äúhumanity‚Äù, which is unacceptable.  After all, you do it not for robots. <br><br>  However, at the level of the tools built into the CMS, the S specialist is a very useful figure. <br><br>  For example, imagine a project like CMS visualization of linking.  This solution will be very useful, as it will help you get rid of unnecessary internal links and always have a visualized site map, no matter how it grows.  Automatic generation and submission of website templates to Webmasters / Analytics is also not the last function, which helps to always provide updated information about a website to a search engine.  It is also very convenient if the CMS will allow you to edit .htacces and robots.txt, without leaving the environment and automatically saving copies.  Augmented tinyMCE or another text editor can allow any text to be analyzed for entries according to given keywords according to the algorithm developed by SEOschennik. <br><br><h5>  Marketer, undoubtedly, will also have their own ideas. </h5><br><br>  The marketer will be pleased to add control over the subscriptions of users to the TZ with maintaining the database of e-mail addresses and the ability to sort users by their requests.  For example, in the online store it will be sorting by products sold by users, by price of goods, by frequency of site visits ... Marketer, definitely, will want to add the ability to automatically send pre-loaded and prepared for different user groups (VIP, NOOB, etc.) Promo and PI materials obtained from sorting results by specified filters.  That is, those who buy more expensive products, will go to the card for discounts and an invitation to the Ball.  And those who are cheaper - letters with an offer to use a discount program that allows you to save on more expensive things.  In addition, the marketer will want a module that allows you to analyze the suggestions and requests of users.  That is, it will ask you to implement in the CMS the ability to see the log of notes to the goods and sort them by samopisnym filters.  Also, the marketer will want the site to automatically and with a predetermined period interview the main resources that are sources of content for keywords in the headlines and immediately notify content managers about materials suitable for rewriting or coverage as news.  He is a marketer, he can come up with a lot ... <br><br><h5>  What does ITishnik want? </h5><br><br>  IT specialist will want it not for him to implement all this and, at the same time, for all this to be implemented on a system that he understands, say: PHPmyAdmin engine or a self-written system with mandatory access to the kernel and implemented modularly.  He wants descriptions of the logic of the main functions.  Comments in the code.  And control over the implementation.  That is all that will not give any studio. <br><br>  And then Aytishnik will want to kill the Marketer and SEOshnik, but that's another story ... <br><br><h6>  Instead of an afterword: </h6><br><br>  The essence of this decision is that development, marketing and SEO are so related things that, ideally, for a competent and effective teamwork, it is necessary that each of its participants take the decisions proposed by each of the participants as a prerequisite for implementation.  Through his personal knowledge and capabilities. <br>  Then marketing will take SEO into account, development will be based on marketing as an optimal model for achieving the objectives, and SEO will be thought out taking into account development possibilities. <br>  Only in this way, and in no other way, is efficiency achieved. <br><br>  But so on paper, but in fact, each takes into account the man-hours of work, the possibilities and goals of the departments, the position of the leadership and a thousand other factors ... <br><br>  So how, after all, to keep Marketer and Seoshnik alive, implement the perfect CMS and get 200% efficiency, avoiding the detective story? <br><br>  Implement a modular software structure that allows you to add and edit existing solutions? <br><br>  Find an opportunity to share SEO, development and marketing? <br><br>  The question remains open.  Maybe you know the solution? </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/203610/">https://habr.com/ru/post/203610/</a></p>
