Part 0</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/4ca/33f/1c9/4ca33f1c9aa14a82a9da938500de6be6.jpg"><br><br>  Work ... What does this word mean to you?  We spend more than 30% of our life on this activity, and if you are already over 30, then you are definitely familiar with procrastination, monotony, and the hopelessness of performing duties according to the job description.  We give this activity the best years of our life, sometimes sacrificing relationships with loved ones, health, and sometimes our own talent.  Someone plays the role of a hired employee, another plays the role of a boss, but are there many happy people among them?  Happy precisely at work, and not at home, on vacation or in the other world?  Author stop!  What happiness at work ?!  I rent my hands, legs, head in exchange for money, or I rent it all to earn money again!  Work is a sales contact where each side seeks to pay the minimum price.  Yes, this is a common point of view on the organization of collective activities, which the author considers hopelessly outdated. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Before getting acquainted with the research of Frederick Lalu (the book ‚ÄúDiscovering the Organizations of the Future‚Äù), I was looking for ways to organize the collaboration of people who conform to my principles and beliefs.  Initially, I was not satisfied with the role of a subordinate, adapting and climbing the career ladder, so I chose my path, becoming an entrepreneur.  But the role of the manager-manager did not particularly inspire me, the very essence that someone needs to be managed, demanded, controlled, punished and encouraged, all this is more like a game than a real activity.  I became acquainted with management techniques, with management struggles and in practice I encountered different psychological games that are played out between the boss and subordinates. <br><br>  In general, it was not at all what could be called a good organization of joint activities.  On the one hand, I am a peaceful person, not a lover of conflicts, and do not accept violence and deception as a tool for achieving a goal, but on the other hand, I absolutely cannot put up with injustice, cruelty and humiliation of human dignity.  Therefore, I had a choice: either to accept the existing state of affairs, i.e.  change your principles, or change your environment and create an organization that meets my beliefs:

    <ul><li>  Most people are unique and positive individuals, worthy of respect, help in development and implementation; <br></li><li>  No one has the right to use, coerce, humiliate and harm other people; </li><li>  Developed people are able to interact as an equal to an equal, from an Adult to an Adult, without hierarchy and subordination; </li><li>  Human potential is huge, and everyone has the right to its full realization; </li><li>  A person must have a higher purpose and personal mission; </li></ul><br>  Competition, conflict, war, manipulation, deception, hypocrisy and other consequences of the centralization of power and resources are all very inefficient methods of interaction, but they are replaced by: cooperation, respect, interconnectedness, openness, honesty, meaningfulness, and this is realized in a synergistic effect .  Synergy is a key phenomenon for new organizations, it manifests itself when the effect from the whole exceeds the sum of the effects of its components, i.e.  when 2 + 2 = 5, 7, 10!  An example from physics: if two pieces of a radioactive substance are combined, when the critical mass is reached, the radiation energy will exceed the total radiation energy of these pieces separately by orders of magnitude. <br><br>  In order for a synergistic effect to occur in joint work, its participants must have a certain level of personal and professional development; in addition, they must interact on the basis of common principles and strive for a common goal.  Here it can be argued that there is a threshold of entry, which is not presented as a step, below which entry is impossible, but as a hill, to which everyone can climb at different speeds, but there is still a minimum level below which a person simply does not want to do this, since can not understand why. <br><br>  For the birth of a <b>synergistic organization</b> (F. Lalu uses the term "turquoise organizations") everyone must strive for integrity and development, and for this it is necessary to clearly formulate the highest goal and its mission.  The new model of interaction is based on the self-organization and integrity of the participants of the association, pursuing an evolutionary goal.  There are no bosses, no subordinates in it, there are not even posts.  And it works on an order of magnitude more efficiently than the existing hierarchical systems. <br><br>  It seems to me that the future of organizations is in complete abandonment of hiring-dismissal procedures and any form of authoritarianism, since I consider this to be an atavism of the infantile-consumer society.  This society is now the foundation of a hierarchical world order.  But we live at the moment of the shift of the public paradigm, the transition to a new ‚Äúenergy level‚Äù.  Economic crises occur more and more deeply, these bouts of financial fever are confirmation that the time of rebirth and rethinking of the principles of interaction is coming. <br><br>  Also now is the active development of new information systems based on blockchain technology.  If earlier all attempts to create a distributed system rested against a centralized infrastructure, now this restriction has been removed.  New generation systems will be able to provide unchangeable data storage and a decentralized computing environment for the execution of new generation programs. <br><br>  A person will receive a comprehensive education, he will be able to participate in various projects on a voluntary basis, realizing his knowledge, gaining new experience, resources and reputation.  If he performs useful and necessary work, he receives high marks from his colleagues and can count on the appropriate resource for life and development, which is formed as a result of the useful activity of the organization.  The very essence of organizations will change; these will be open information systems with clearly defined rules of interaction based on decentralized data storage and processing technologies. <br><br>  There will be no chief administrator, just like the board of directors, and the rules will be presented in the form of a program protocol.  The protocol can be changed only by the method of reaching multiple consensus, which does not prohibit the development of the system in various directions.  The minority will not be able to block the work of the majority, as well as vice versa, everyone will have a chance to prove the effectiveness of their version.  Thus, organizations will evolve, and this will generate an order of magnitude more advanced forms and methods of interaction.  Even the boundaries between synergistic organizations will erase over time, as they will be tightly integrated with each other. <br><br>  The complete openness and transparency of such organizations is a persistent immunity against hypocrisy, deception, manipulation, in general, any forms of destructive behavior.  As a result, all the energy for protection and struggle will be directed to useful activities.  Everyone will have the opportunity to develop, acquiring the integrity of the individual and helping others in this.  Now for the emergence of such forms of organizations there are all the prerequisites: <br><br><ul><li>  The objective need to change the social paradigm; </li><li>  Sufficient knowledge in sociology and psychology; </li><li>  <b>The initial positive experience of the pioneers;</b> </li><li>  <b>The emergence of new information technology based on the Internet and blockchain.</b> </li></ul><br>  Now it's up to us, if we are ready to leave the comfort zone and develop in this direction, then I am sure that everything will work out.  It will be a difficult, but interesting way for creative and hardworking people with a holistic and happy life.  This is exactly what I've been doing for the last 5 years.  And this article I want to open a series in which I can share theoretical and practical results. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/313414/">https://habr.com/ru/post/313414/</a></p>
