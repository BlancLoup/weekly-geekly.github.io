  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Review of fresh materials, July-August 2013</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  For three years now I have been publishing regular reviews of fresh articles on the topic of interfaces, new tools and collections of patterns, interesting cases and historical stories.  From the tapes of several hundred thematic subscriptions, approximately 5% of the worthwhile publications are selected that are interesting to share.  Previous materials: <a href="http://www.jvetrau.com/digest/">April 2010-June 2013</a> . <br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/389/b3f/4b5/389b3f4b500454f09697c7894b2e1b89.png" alt="Review of fresh materials, July-August 2013" width="129" height="150"></div><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  Patterns and Best Practices </h2><br>  <strong><a href="http://pinterest.com/jvetrau/gestures-transitions-animations/">Gestures, Transitions, Animations @ Pinterest</a></strong> <br>  I collected my Pinterest collection of interface animations, transitions and gestures to call them.  Two hundred examples that are particularly relevant in the light of the transition of iOS from the decor to the motion-design.  Other selections: <br><ul><li>  <a href="http://pinterest.com/jvetrau/mobile-ios7/">Applications for iOS7</a> . </li><li>  <a href="http://pinterest.com/jvetrau/mobile-metro-flat-style/">High-quality mobile applications in metro and flat design</a> . </li><li>  <a href="http://pinterest.com/jvetrau/boards/">Another couple of dozens of collections on the design and design of interfaces</a> . </li></ul><br>  <strong><a href="https://medium.com/design-ux/a93647e5a44b">Hollow Icons</a></strong> <br>  Aubrey Johnson criticizes the iOS7 interface icons for being harder to read.  Many studies show that the thin contour is read by the user heavier than the solid form. <br><br>  <strong><a href="http://sixrevisions.com/usability/hyperlink-design/">Designing the Perfect Hyperlink</a></strong> <br>  Excellent article by John Macpherson on how to make links.  It is important that they are sufficiently contrast for visibility, but do not interfere with reading.  And a couple of discussions from domestic experts - <a href="https://medium.com/ui-in-russian/ecaccd209a54">https://medium.com/ui-in-russian/ecaccd209a54</a> and <a href="https://medium.com/interface-1/e6356aa5f023">https://medium.com/interface-1/e6356aa5f023</a> . <br><br>  <strong><a href="http://uxdesign.smashingmagazine.com/2013/08/13/guide-to-designing-touch-keyboards-with-cheat-sheet/">A Guide To Designing Touch Keyboards (With Cheat Sheet)</a></strong> <br>  Baymard Institute collected another article on the results of its extensive research of mobile online stores on input methods.

This means that in the forms you need to provide click handlers for this case. <br><br>  <strong><a href="http://baymard.com/blog/credit-card-declined">How to Recoup 30% of "Card Declined" Abandonments</a></strong> <br>  Christian Holst offers an interesting way to increase conversion in online stores, which involves the processing of payment errors that occur due to the fault of the payment system.

This is also true for other types of products - companies are in different conditions, set different business tasks, have different sources of traffic, etc. <br><br>  <strong><a href="http://gigaom.com/2013/08/19/heres-what-you-need-to-know-about-the-future-of-gesture-based-ui-design/">Here's the design of your gesture.</a></strong> <br>  A good overview of the basic principles of creating gestures in mobile applications from Rani Molla. <br><br>  <strong><a href="http://beyondthebeep.tumblr.com/">Beyond the Beep</a></strong> <br>  Unique blog Jordan Kolasinski, dedicated to the use of sounds in the interfaces. <br><br>  <strong><a href="http://uxmovement.com/forms/how-to-make-your-form-error-messages-more-reassuring/">How To Make Your Form Error Messages More Reassuring</a></strong> <br>  A small reminder of errors in the interfaces.

This is a playing cube in the continuation of its popular playing cards, which helps to look at the interaction from five sides - emotions, memory and perception, motivation, inspiration and frustration, decision making. <br><br>  <strong><a href="http://boxesandarrows.com/emotional-design-with-a-c-t-part-2/">Emotional Design with ACT</a></strong> <br>  The prolonged continuation of the excellent article Trevor van Gorp about the emotional component in the interfaces.  He describes a very interesting concept of the product‚Äôs relationship with the user, tied to the message ‚Äúuseful, usable, desirable‚Äù.  <a href="http://boxesandarrows.com/emotional-design-with-a-c-t-part-1/">The first part</a> .

In addition to relevance and representativeness, they should help in determining the required functionality, and the goals of specific characters should be evaluable and have metrics for their achievement. <br><br>  <strong><a href="http://www.meltingasphalt.com/left-and-right-brain-user-personas/">Left and Right Brain User Personas</a></strong> <br>  Kevin Simler's article on how to consider when designing characters with left-hemispheric and right-hemispheric thinking. <br><br>  <strong><a href="http://www.nngroup.com/articles/write-interesting-facts/">Interesting Facts Make Web Pages Compelling</a></strong> <br>  Jakob Nielsen describes the findings of the NN / g studies among journalists.
