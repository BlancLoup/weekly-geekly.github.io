However, it is possible to get training from ITMO University teachers without enrollment - it‚Äôs enough to sign up for the University‚Äôs open online course and try your hand at programming, photonics, rheology, optics and other areas developed by ITMO University.  Perhaps such a course will help someone to decide on the direction of training and future research, or better prepare for entrance examinations (which is especially important, for example, for entering the magistracy). <br><br> <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/spbifmo/blog/320496/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a13/f77/410/a13f774103cd4b11a80a275ce44df16a.jpg"></a> <a name="habracut"></a>  <i>r.</i>  <i>nial bradshaw / <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/zionfiction/14229163349">Flickr</a> / <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/">CC</a></i> <br><br>  Many of the courses from ITMO University are designed for students who are familiar with higher mathematics and physics at the level of a technical university, but some are quite suitable for schoolchildren (we remind students that they can receive credit units to qualify for their courses at their university).  We have included those courses that start next month (February 20 or February 27) in this selection - those who decide to take the opportunity to learn from the teachers and professors of the ITMO University have a few more weeks to make their choice.
