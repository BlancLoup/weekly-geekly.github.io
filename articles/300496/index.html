  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How to get natural backlinks?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  When you have a product, project, service, or application, you want people to know about you.  You have many ways to achieve this, including - to interest others to tell about you.  If you are lucky, natural links will appear on you - not only the most logical option, but also, from relatively recent times, it is a <a href="http://searchengineland.com/google-try-avoid-link-building-can-harm-good-214861">requirement of Google</a> , which has learned to distinguish between natural links and purchased ones.  Yandex, at least in words, <a href="https://yandex.ru/blog/webmaster/20337">would like from us the same</a> .  In this regard, it is interesting: what does the civilized practice of obtaining natural backlinks look like? <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/43d/0a1/5f2/43d0a15f24a94d4daea7b07b1b3724f4.jpg" alt="image"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Why people might want to link to you?  Two aspects are important in obtaining natural backlinks: planning and time.  Each new link for Google can be a signal to rank you higher, especially if you are not on the first page - then it makes it more likely.  However, for this link must have certain parameters.  She must be: <br><br><ul><li>  Relevant, i.e.  go from a site with a similar theme. </li><li>  Natural, i.e.  not purchased </li><li>  Going from a domain with a good rating (DA). </li></ul><br>  The success of the event depends on how skillfully you plan your next steps in obtaining these links.  Let's see how to do this. <br>  The easiest way to satisfy two of the three conditions: to find relevant domains with a good rating.  To do this, do not even need to type them in the search.  It is enough to skip the sites of competitors through the backlink check services:

    <ul><li>  <a href="https://ru.megaindex.com/donors">Comparison of Donor</a> Links, MegaIndex - for free, you can compare several sites at once. </li><li>  <a href="https://moz.com/researchtools/ose/">Open Site Explorer</a> , Moz - for free, more suitable for English-speaking domains. </li><li>  <a href="https://majestic.com/plans-pricing">MajesticSEO</a> - good, but heavily paid. </li></ul><br>  After such a check, you will have a list of target sites from which you also want links for yourself.  It remains to think how to get them. <br><br><h2>  Who will get links? </h2><br><ul><li>  Agency </li><li>  Employee </li><li>  You, using knowledge from open sources </li></ul><br>  The agency is supported by the fact that at high speeds it can have streamlined processes and experience in this area.  And may not be.  Alternatively, you can try to motivate your own employee for this job - in this case, you get more control over the situation.  If the budget does not allow you to rely on both options, you can try to get the links yourself - in principle, there is nothing difficult in this, but this is a very time-consuming exercise, so it would be better to delegate it. <br><br><h2>  Why do people want to refer to you? </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/0f7/5fa/9c6/0f75fa9c665b4484aeac57205db81962.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Getting natural backlinks is a painstaking exercise: finding a person to implement a strategy is time.  Content creation is time.  However, any content will not work.  Only certain types of it, and then with the proper submission, are able to give long-awaited links.  What to write and who to knock? <br><br><h3>  Share your experience or know how </h3><br>  Communicate with experts in your field.  Let them be aware that you are always ready to share valuable information, opinions or feedback.  In this case, you may be contacted (or not refused) if you count on: <br><ul><li>  Guest Post </li><li>  Analytics </li><li>  Quote, expert opinion </li><li>  Materials for download </li></ul><br><br><h3>  Use a scientific approach </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/2b1/b17/e3d/2b1b17e3dbd34b0196441ed7fec8d412.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Any company has data about its own audience, market, industry.  Tell about them and what conclusions you draw on the basis of these data.  This is one of the most difficult ways, but here you have far fewer competitors - not everyone can competently submit analytics, moreover, such texts, as a rule, take almost as much time to create them as high-quality video or infographics.  And, of course, do not forget to scatter this research to people, including professional and news sites. <br><br>  Most often, data for research can be found in the manual, which uses analytical sources for the decision-making process, such as <a href="http://www.gartner.com/technology/home.jsp">Gartner</a> , <a href="https://www.forrester.com/home/">Forrester</a> , <a href="http://www.ovum.com/">Ovum</a> , <a href="http://www.altimetergroup.com/">Altimeter</a> , <a href="https://www.cebglobal.com/">Corporate Executive Board</a> or their Russian counterparts.  From such reports, you can create surveys of market trends, they provide an opportunity to share figures.  However, before you do this, examine the conditions under which you purchased your report from the analytical company itself ‚Äî someone forbids disclosing data, others forbid the use of digits from the report to promote a particular product or company.  In most cases, a disclaimer is required, the text of which can be found in the privacy policy section of the website of the analytical agency from which you purchased the study. <br><br>  No third-party data?  Use your own: take analytics of your site and sites of your competitors. <br><br><h3>  Related topics </h3><br>  Search the Internet for resources dedicated to the same topic as your website or blog.  Regularly monitor the Internet on the topic of the emergence of new posts in the style of ‚ÄúTop 10 Anything for Something ...‚Äù, which will be devoted to your topics.  Knock to their authors.  Ask to add your site, product or service to the list.  As a rule, the window of opportunity here is from several hours to several days.  Never miss a chance to add your product, service or mention of yourself wherever it is possible and appropriate.  This will help you: <br><br><ul><li>  Directories (not the old type, but newer ones, like Community <a href="https://www.producthunt.com/">Hunt</a> , like <a href="https://www.producthunt.com/">Product Hunt</a> ) </li><li>  Review Sites </li><li>  Blogs </li><li>  Posts ‚Äú20 of the best someone ...‚Äù </li><li>  Sites dedicated to questions and answers (the so-called services Q &amp; A, <a href="https://www.quora.com/">Quora</a> and others like it) </li><li>  Sites of useful advice ( <a href="http://www.wikihow.com/Main-Page">Wiki-How</a> and similar) </li></ul><br><blockquote>  <b>What you do not need:</b> in the 21st century, links from comments will definitely not help if we are talking about Google.  Now they are considered as a negative factor for ranking. <br><br>  Also, you should not ‚Äúpush‚Äù, crush, try to sell something in your posts or in correspondence with the authors.  Even in that case - and especially in the case when, say, investors stand at your shoulder and demand quick results.  It is important to understand here that you are ‚Äúnot alone so smart.‚Äù  Everyone wants.  All are knocking to the same authors.  Therefore, pressure on them will not help you, especially since, in the good, they are not interested in you. </blockquote><br><h3>  Visual load </h3><br>  If you don‚Äôt have a designer in your team, take a freelancer - usually, find and select the specialist you need on the relevant site for a maximum of half an hour.  Visual content that users can share with pleasure: <br><br><ul><li>  Infographics </li><li>  Video clip </li></ul><br>  Here we must take into account that sensible infographics or video require at least a week of work.  Plus, if the designer draws well, it does not mean that he or she understands diagrams or your subject matter.  However, these problems can be patiently solved. <br><br>  Most importantly, do not forget to regularly monitor the Internet after publishing for new references to your materials.  Often they will be distributed without reference or with the wrong link.  Contact the author and ask him to fix it - most often, people willingly respond, although sometimes they do not respond immediately. <br><br><h2>  How will this work? </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/073/874/b8e/073874b8e5b34392aeb4bfa1e88f68ec.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Although it took you a lot of time and effort to create content, in fact, this is not the point of getting backlinks.  And most of the time will be spent on a completely different activity, namely the correspondence, calls and meetings with your new friends - specialists, bloggers, familiar with the forums.  How to find them?  How and with what you can knock on them, but what better not to do?  The most difficult thing here is that, in fact, they don't need you.  There are a lot of people like you, besides, within the framework of the concept of natural links, you don‚Äôt pay them.  Therefore, first of all, you need a reserve of patience.  Sometimes you will have to wait for a response to your letter for more than one week, after which a reference or link to you may suddenly appear.  And the link may most likely be incorrect.  And you will need to not lose the thread of what is happening, and in time to ask to correct what needs to be corrected. <br><br>  Something like this is the daily routine of a specialist who is responsible for obtaining natural backlinks for Google - linkbuilder. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/300496/">https://habr.com/ru/post/300496/</a></p>
