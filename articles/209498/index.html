  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Experience of using MNP in Russia or how I transferred the number from operator to operator</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  When they announced the abolition of mobile slavery, I decided to transfer my number from the SkyLink network to the Beeline network in order to finally be able to use normal cellular phones, because the range of CDMA450 phones is quite poor. <br><br><h4>  About the relevance of data on the old contract </h4><br>  In the first week of December (I don‚Äôt remember the number), I turned to one of the Moscow offices of Beeline and asked me to accept an application for number portability.  They were ready to do this, but they asked to make sure that SkyLink now has my current passport data - this is a mandatory requirement of number transfer.  It turned out that they did not have such data.  The correspondence with SkyLink on the change of passport data in the contract began, and therefore the number transfer process was delayed for a week. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  About fear of accepting applications </h4><br>  After the passport data in SkyLink was updated, I went to the same Beeline office again.  But there was already another employee who refused to accept the application.  Argued by the fact that other networks are not yet ready for MNP, and in any case, the number will not be transferred.  She also refused to accept the application at a later date (not the next 8 days, but at the end of January). <br>  I called the support service to verify the information.  But they said by phone that they were mistaken in the office, and I can apply.  Well, let's try in another office. <br><br><h4>  Not all offices are connected to the system. </h4><br>  A few days later I went to another Beeline office.  But there they answered me that this office is not yet connected to the MNP system and was advised the address of the nearest one where you can submit such an application.  Well, let's go there.

    <h4>  Statement - attempt number of times </h4><br>  Here, my application was finally accepted.  The procedure was about half an hour.  It was necessary to purchase a SIM-card for 200 rubles, from which, in the future, 100 rubles would be written off for transfer.  But the miracle did not happen.  The next day, an SMS message arrived that stated that the transfer of the number was denied to me.  For the reasons they asked to contact the donor operator, I mean SkyLink.  I called them and received a rather strange answer, which sounded like this: ‚ÄúFrom Beeline we received a scan of the application.  We opened it, but it was unintelligible.  We needed to verify the passport data, but we could not disassemble them from the scan.  Therefore it was necessary to refuse.  Apply again. ‚Äù  After a while, walking in the center, I stumbled upon the Beeline office and decided to do what SkyLink advised, I mean, to apply again.  But they told me that they didn‚Äôt need to do this, and on January 15 an automatic resubmission would take place on all the denied applications.  I began to doubt, but it was going for the New Year holidays, and so far I have abandoned this idea. <br><br><h4>  Statement - Attempt Number Two </h4><br>  After the New Year holidays, I went to the office where I submitted the first application and asked to show the scan they sent to SkyLink.  They made a printout, which was very clearly visible all the data that was printed, and not written by hand (so that the question of illegible handwriting is removed here).  He asked me what to do.  Received the answer that you need to apply again.  What I immediately did.  This time the process lasted less than 10 minutes and ended in victory - the next day it was reported that the number transfer operation was approved, and on January 17, 2014 at 23:00 the number will be on the Beeline network. <br><br><h4>  And how does it work? </h4><br>  At the specified time, when calling from SkyLink, the robot began to say something like ‚ÄúYou are out of range of the operator‚Äôs network in which you serve‚Äù.  Outgoing calls with Beeline terminated immediately.  When I tried to call the number, it was said that he was dialed incorrectly (if calling from MTS), or not served (if calling from MGTS, MTT or Skype).  Incoming SMS did not come even from Beeline himself.  At 23:15 I tried to make an outgoing call again.  Happened.  It also turned out to send an SMS message.  But incoming calls and SMS were still unavailable.  Remembering the six-hour limit on communication, which is described in the description of the service on the Beeline website, I decided to wait for the morning.  In the morning earned incoming calls from the MTS.  With MGTS, MTT and Skype, the robot still says that the number is not serviced.  Incoming SMS still do not come (a password from a personal account, for example, therefore cannot be received).  When you call on the transferred number, there is no robot, which, as expected, will report that the number has been transferred, the connection is just right.  100 rubles for the MNP service were not written off from the account. <br><br>  In general, like this.  Let's see what will happen next, it is possible that today during the day everything will work. <br><br>  UPD: I checked payment through the TKS Bank mobile app.  Passed  Money in the account appeared. <br><br>  UPD2: I called Beeline customer service, asked why there were no calls from MGTS and SMS from everywhere.  They apologized, said that this is a common problem, and it remains only to wait until the experts fix it. <br><br>  UPD3.  Calls from Megaphone pass. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/209498/">https://habr.com/ru/post/209498/</a></p>
