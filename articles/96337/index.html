  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Domestic design education. Senseless and merciless</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The fact that in our country everything is somehow not very good with design, they probably know everything.  Even worse than with the design itself, we only have design training.  Between the world where design is taught (or trying to parasitize it in the case of designer unions) and the world where this design is made, there is a huge gap.  These two worlds live in parallel and their contact with each other, as a rule, ends in large-scale battles of varying degrees of epic. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  When nothing foreshadowed trouble ... </h4><br>  Somehow last year we made the website of the admission committee for one university.  But, in this university, as it turned out, there are adherents of design.  Moreover, this university even has the relevant institutions and the darkness of the design departments.  Seeing that their unchallenged authority can still crack, local designers rallied to endure the infection presented in our person, beyond, so to speak, their own jurisdiction.  After the presentation of the intermediate result of our works, someone from the institute engaged in the design of shoes, said that he would have done a deuce for this.  We nodded together, because we also believe that at least it‚Äôs indecent to bring a website for a shoe design exam. <br><br><h4>  First suspicions </h4><br>  Further, more, allegedly, the guards, order-bearing and labor red banner of the special brigade for the removal of the brain from the local design institute were sent to help us.  We immediately realized that we are waiting for a very thick and inept trolling.  Attempting a dispute with one of the incoming characters ended in that we were told ‚ÄúThis person actually has Microsoft certificate‚Äù.  Apparently, this argument should have made us realize the full importance of the moment and meaningfully stretch in response ‚ÄúAh-ah-ah ...‚Äù.  How the availability of the certificate of Microsoft has pumped the skill Web design is not specified.  Be that as it may, we still began to look at him with some apprehension, Microsoft after all. <br><br>  By the way, all these guys hate all our domestic web industry (knowing only Tema Lebedev).  According to their version, the reason for this hatred lies in the fact that we are all upstarts uneducated.  I dare to guess that in fact, this is caused by the fundamental difference in the approaches, methods, and also the banal professional level.  We did not receive a diploma in web design from the hands of a person who, until the mid-90s, was engaged in the artistic design of shoes, and then read a book about HTML and, on this basis, considered himself the founder of Russian web design.  Our guests for a long time could not understand why we are making a rubber website.  After all, the text will then crawl away.  And what if on a very wide screen will look?  Some of us at that moment tried to argue, someone was shaking a petty demon with laughter.  It lasted all for a long time.  No, it all went on very, incredibly, incredibly long!  Looking ahead to say that the blow was beaten off.  After the final short skirmish brigade retired in full force.

      All the beauty and absurdity of the moment emphasized the questions, for obvious reasons, unanswered.  ‚ÄúAnd why, if you‚Äôve been here for a long time and successfully engaged in web design, the site of your university, let's say, is not very good?‚Äù.  Or "Show me what sites are you doing?"  Or checklist: ‚ÄúCan you give an example of a site that you like?‚Äù.  The answer to the last question was still received.  And what an answer!  We were shown some Canadian website made in the worst traditions of Western site-building, but with a distinct flavor of the motherland (it was impossible to get to some links, because the drop-down menu was open exactly until the cursor was at the header, an attempt would be made to go down the menu down caused its collapse).  As it turned out, this is the site of some Russian designer (interior designer, really), who left for Canada.  And this designer was somehow connected with our visitors.  Small party, in short, as usual. <br><br><h4>  Exit to Astral </h4><br>  The next day, one head of another institute, which was also somehow connected with the design, advised me to remove underscores from all links.  After a short pause, I was wary, but nothing at all, and without being surprised, asked: <br><br>  <i>- Why?</i> <br><br>  <i>- I have been teaching this web design for 20 years and I‚Äôm not going to argue with you</i> - there was an answer for me. <br><br>  I remind readers that, according to the official version, the first website appeared in 1990, and the events described here occurred a year ago, in 2009. Suddenly realizing that Tim Berners-Lee is not a pioneer in this area, and now I'm talking to the real creator World Wide Web, I had no choice but to recognize the truth of my interlocutor. <br><br>  Unfortunately, we have not had a chance to see the works of students of this institute.  But, I am sure that humanity will someday understand the whole advantage of sites without underlined links.  I really hope I don‚Äôt live to that moment. <br><br><h4>  When to spit on everything </h4><br>  After a while, the adjustments of our sketch came from the ‚Äúbrigade‚Äù that had come to us recently, whose gold fund for some reason decided to help us in this way.  The search string together with the substrate now occupied a third of the page in width and was three hundred pixels in height.  Most of the icons and other elements also appeared underlay.  In the beginning, we even thought that they solved the problem of png transparency in IE 6 in such a brutal way. As it turned out, no, it‚Äôs just ‚Äúholistic‚Äù. <br><br><img src="http://www.designspb.ru/wp-content/themes/sdspb/logo.gif" alt="image" align="left">  I think everyone understands that in this temple of design, the incubator of creators and just a wonderful institution can not be representatives of the St. Petersburg Union of Designers.  The last straw was that one of the employees working here, I'm sorry, members responded about the newly created site not in the most biased way.  Yes, dear Habravchane, St. Petersburg Union of Designers is the very organization, the logo of which depicts a poorly veiled erect male pipiska, which best embodies the essence of this organization. <br><br><h4>  Instead of an epilogue </h4><br>  As a result, we have completed this site.  And they completed it as they themselves considered necessary.  Moreover, if all the idiocy had come from one or two heroes, we, perhaps, would have given way, but, a huge number of ‚Äúdesigners‚Äù who tried to take part in the project, would eventually play into our hands.  Their advice was so controversial that it was impossible to follow them for good reason. <br><br>  Any university where there is something, even remotely connected with the design, considers it its duty to introduce a specialization of media, communication, interactive and any other non-existent type of design.  Applicants can easily be conducted on such and with pleasure bear honestly earned parent loot.  As part of learning some fashionable design, web design is naturally taught.  It also happens that it is taught in the framework of graphic design.  The people who teach all of this are, for the most part, graphs, they have nothing to do with web design.  But, the fashion (and money-holding capacity) of this discipline, along with exorbitant ƒåSV, do not allow our heroes to doubt their own awareness in this matter. <br><br>  In conclusion, I would like to say that in addition to the flourishing lack of professionalism in the field of design education, there is something good in such places.  There are people who do something, who want something.  These people every day lead an unequal battle with indifference and stupidity.  Working with such people was really interesting. <br><br>  To be continued‚Ä¶ </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/96337/">https://habr.com/ru/post/96337/</a></p>
