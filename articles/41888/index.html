  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The best graphic editors written in Flash</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><h1>  The best graphic editors written in Flash </h1><br>  When it comes to migrating from Windows to other platforms or to web applications, every time there is an undeniable argument: but there is no photoshop there either!  Thanks to pirates, this legendary graphic package has taken root, probably, on the vast majority of computers in the CIS.  And undoubtedly it is difficult to find an alternative to such a complex program.  But frankly, how is the power of Photoshop used in most cases?  Resize, adjust brightness, sometimes remove extra details, send it to girlfriend by e-mail. <br>  Do I need a full-fledged big Photoshop for this?  In most cases, no, unless you are a high-end professional designer.  So, it will be easier to find an analogue. <br>  But to look for an analog among desktop programs or programs under Linux is not interesting!  We live in the age of Web 2.0, so we will try to look for analogues among web applications.  Yes, more recently it would be fantastic, but the development of graphics capabilities above all Flash already today allows to get very interesting results.  Of course, the editors described will not be a full-fledged replacement for the ‚Äúbig brother‚Äù, but they will be useful for small photo corrections.  Or imagine yourself in an Internet cafe, where you don‚Äôt have the usual software, and you need to urgently take a ready-made picture, change, mark or sign something in it and send it to the other person.  In this case, one of the programs considered below can also save you. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><blockquote>  Disclamer: All screenshots are clickable.  But since they were all made in full size, some of them weigh very noticeably.  In the text, only reduced versions. </blockquote><br><h2>  72photos </h2><br> <a href="" title="72photos by Vete, on Flickr"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/12a/688/39f/12a68839f8df56e27e083d6f2924bddb.jpg" width="500" height="314" alt="72photos" align="right"></a> <br>  <a href="http://72photos.com/">http://72photos.com</a> <br>  This is not even an editor, but rather a photo gallery, giving the opportunity to slightly edit the saved images.  No drawing.  You can only impose effects on the picture, correcting the color rendition, brightness, and cutting off the excess.  There is also a blur / sharpness and a pair of standard filters.  Everything is quite average, nothing outstanding, but how interesting the use of Flash features will do.  It does not work without registration, it supports free and paid versions.  The latter is distinguished by increased disk space and traffic limits.  Of the useful features worth noting the ability to work with pictures stored on other photohosting, however, from a very small list. <br><br><h2>  FotoFlexer </h2><br> <a href="" title="FotoFlexer by Vete, on Flickr"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/b31/145/05d/b3114505dfba04f6e29255650e5a2a1c.jpg" width="500" height="312" alt="FotoFlexer" align="right"></a> <br>  <a href="http://fotoflexer.com/">http://fotoflexer.com/</a> <br>  An ambiguous editor with both a number of undeniable merits and some flaws. <br>  Well, for a start - this is the absolute leader in the implemented functions.  It supports the largest number of photo hosting sites from which you can upload a photo for editing, it is also possible to simply download by URL, which will allow editing any picture at all, downloading pictures from the user's computer is also available.  Saving is more difficult.  To save the file where you want, you have to register.  And even just like that, they will not give the file to the computer.  We'll have to rip out from some file dumping machine.  Or register.  Trifle, but unpleasant. <br>  A huge number of effects and instruments.  Here even some traditional editors succumb.  Draw, apply effects, transform a picture.  There are even ready-to-add graphic primitives that allow you to create photos so popular by people with the insertion of the faces of friends, for example, dollars.  Or add them to an unknown bodybuilder.  To do this, now do not have to go to Sochi or go to a photo studio!  :) Here you can also fasten the frames and make a poster.  In general, freedom for the domestic photographer.  Unless to sign ‚Äúthis is me and Kolyan‚Äù will not work.  Russian text program does not understand.  When I tried to enter the Russian text, I received the same text ... in the English layout. <br>  There are tools for a more serious public.  Complicated transformations, selection and repainting tools, similar to the usual tools, even some support for layers. <br>  True for all this re-tweaking you have to pay for the presence of small glitches and flaws.  That window will not come out, the frame will remain on the screen, although the corresponding tool is already closed, some strange elements will pop out.  Well, the banner on the entire width of the screen at the very top is somewhat annoying.  However, you have to put up.  There are no analogs in functionality among online services today. <br><br><h2>  Phoenix </h2><br> <a href="" title="Phoenix by Vete, on Flickr"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/5b1/ff9/996/5b1ff9996b28c1cd30616719e8856b8c.jpg" width="500" height="348" alt="Phoenix" align="right"></a> <br>  <a href="http://a.viary.com/tools/phoenix">http://a.viary.com/tools/phoenix</a> <br>  Very nice editor with a nice, thoughtful interface.  Without registration, he refuses to work.  But then he is able to open files not only from his server and the user's computer, but also from third-party services and by URL. <br>  After opening the file, we get a very nice editor with a good set of filters and effects.  There is a complete drawing, even with the possibility of Russian inscriptions.  Layers are supported.  Slightly distresses the server part, which likes to falter when saving.  Yes, and the application itself could work faster.  The rest is a great editor.

    <h2>  Photoshop Express </h2><br> <a href="" title="photoshop by Vete, on Flickr"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/605/d6c/703/605d6c7032c16266735c24ea822ab000.jpg" width="500" height="311" alt="photoshop" align="right"></a> <br>  <a href="https://www.photoshop.com/express/">https://www.photoshop.com/express/</a> <br>  It would seem that here it is!  The leader, whom everyone was waiting for.  A popular analogue of desktop Photoshop from the creators of Photoshop.  But there are so many nuances.  First you have to register first.  Secondly, we will see not the version of the legendary Photoshop, but rather an analogue of the aforementioned 72photos, only more qualitatively executed.  This is also a photo hosting, and a social one.  You can view other users' galleries, even comment on them.  At the same time, there is no integration with third-party services; you can work only with photos downloaded from the user's computer.  The possibilities of the editor itself are modest.  Resizing, turning, some effects.  Drawing again, no.  However, the existing functions are implemented qualitatively, everything works very well too.  It affects that the authors have developed not only Photoshop, but Flash itself.  The resulting product is pleasant to use.  And I think we should expect further development. <br><br><h2>  PicMagick </h2><br> <a href="" title="PicMagick by Vete, on Flickr"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/a9c/9b0/840/a9c9b08400ef605b54cef7e7639f3774.jpg" width="500" height="287" alt="PicMagick" align="right"></a> <br>  <a href="http://www.picmagick.com/">http://www.picmagick.com/</a> <br>  The elementary and perhaps the most primitive of the editors in question.  Allows you to only upload a picture from your computer, apply a standard set of effects and get your photo back.  There are no possibilities for saving on the server, drawing and integration with other services.  Minimalism in its purest form.  Even registration is not.  The editor is immediately ready for use.  At the same time, the special speed of work is no different.  The only feature distinguishing from a number of other <br>  editors - skin correction filter.  However, the dignity of the dubious, the same can be achieved with other tools. <br><br><h2>  Picnik </h2><br> <a href="" title="picnik by Vete, on Flickr"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/cc8/f67/4ba/cc8f674ba19a5f34a3a76d0e761cd3a5.jpg" width="500" height="312" alt="picnik" align="right"></a> <br>  <a href="http://www.picnik.com/">http://www.picnik.com/</a> <br>  This editor is notable for the fact that it is used on the most popular photo hosting site Flickr as a standard one.  So, there is something in it.  However, no one bothers to use this editor and everyone.  Even without registration.  And you can upload a picture even from a computer, even from a popular photo hosting or blog, at least from any URL.  The editor understands not only standard web-types of graphics, but also a large number of other common formats.  By this parameter, Picnik is the absolute leader. <br>  He is good in implementation.  A sufficiently long start of the application is compensated by a large number of effects and instruments.  A little behind FotoFlexer, it is ahead of the rest of the competition.  Here are just a drawing in its pure form.  You can only impose ready-made graphic primitives.  Well, when I tried to enter the Russian text, I received completely question marks.  Such is the fly in the ointment in the editor as a whole. <br>  You can save the result, too, both on your computer and on popular hosting.  And you can immediately by e-mail.  And in a variety of formats. <br><br><h2>  Pixer.us </h2><br> <a href="" title="pixer_us by Vete, on Flickr"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/4f1/fa3/a65/4f1fa3a650bea5d69bc7caa7c00fa17d.jpg" width="500" height="317" alt="pixer_us" align="right"></a> <br>  <a href="http://pixer.us/">http://pixer.us/</a> <br>  This editor is included in the review rather for the beautiful number of services surveyed.  This is not a Flash editor at all.  It is written in Javascript, which in itself is interesting.  Well, the full editor service does not pull.  You can upload a photo from your computer, apply a series of effects to it and save it back.  And that's all.  Everything works quite smartly, but without frills.  Drawing is not like a class.  But as a demonstration of the possibilities of flashless technologies, the editor is interesting.  For example, if you compare it with Picmagick, then the fight will be at least equal. <br><br><h2>  Pixlr </h2><br> <a href="" title="pixlr by Vete, on Flickr"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/b87/419/e28/b87419e28bce7d760bca65eeb1b72558.jpg" width="500" height="287" alt="pixlr" align="right"></a> <br>  <a href="http://www.pixlr.com/app/%3Floc%3Dru">http://www.pixlr.com/app/?loc=en</a> <br>  This is again a pure editor.  No hosting for you.  But there is an API, which may allow the editor to be built into third-party applications.  However, API research is beyond the scope of my review. <br>  So, we have one of the family of clones of Photoshop.  There is a Russian localization (!!), which other editors cannot boast of.  Accordingly, Russian inscriptions can also be made. <br>  Excellent job optimization.  Everything opens quickly.  Great functionality.  There is even so beloved Magic Wand.  Layers and filters are also in place, although the tooling could be bigger.  However, all the basic gadgets in place.  And the interface again brings back memories of Photoshop.  Pleasant at work, thoughtful editor. <br><br><h2>  Splashup </h2><br> <a href="" title="Splashup by Vete, on Flickr"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/59c/d32/136/59cd321368fe72a41628b81745d8cf87.jpg" width="500" height="311" alt="Splashup" align="right"></a> <br>  <a href="http://www.splashup.com/splashup/">http://www.splashup.com/splashup/</a> <br>  Another representative of the hybrid photo hosting and a good editor.  Actually I did not evaluate photo hosting, but I liked the editor.  Again layers, again effects, again full-fledged drawing.  Russian language does not work, but everything else is at a decent level.  You can upload your picture both from a computer and from the Internet (support for photo hosting sites and direct URLs), edit and save to different places again. <br>  Very convenient, nice interface, excellent speed.  Worthy representative of online editors trying to copy Photoshop. <br><br><h2>  SUMO Paint </h2><br> <a href="" title="sumo by Vete, on Flickr"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/97e/cff/4ef/97ecff4eff1fbd31f977f878517188d7.jpg" width="500" height="316" alt="sumo" align="right"></a> <br>  <a href="http://www.sumopaint.com/">http://www.sumopaint.com/</a> <br>  Very solid editor.  Very close to the desktop application, both in appearance and in functionality. <br>  Truth in compensation separated from the big Internet.  You will not find any downloads by URL or integration with other services.  Only an account on your own server and download from your computer.  The latter, however, worked for me only on one computer.  Perhaps the Finnish server is simply not fast enough to promptly process downloads. <br>  But the functionality is impressive.  There are no pop frames and flowers, only serious adult instruments.  Full support for layers, a variety of effects and filters.  Something reminded old versions of Photoshop.  Very, very decent development.  And even support for Russian fonts in stock.  If you correct the problems with uploading photos, it will be quite wonderful. <br><br><h2>  Conclusion </h2><br>  Yes, none of the online editors is not and is unlikely to compete with Photoshop.  If you can still compete in the basic tools, then when it comes to complex filters, Photoshop leaves no chance to competitors.  And it‚Äôs impossible to imagine batch processing or plug-ins in the online version.  And, of course, professionals will remain true to the usual tool.  But for ordinary users the possibility of online editors today may be quite useful. <br>  By the way, it is curious that almost all editors are created either by enthusiasts or little-known companies.  Which once again confirms: in Web 2.0, even small teams can challenge large corporations.  Old merit does not save anyone. <br>  And I'm not afraid to make a mistake, assuming that in the foreseeable future, similar online editors will begin to build into their services all in the slightest degree large photo hosting sites and social networks.  Therefore, the future of this direction is very bright. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/41888/">https://habr.com/ru/post/41888/</a></p>
