And in July of this year, at <a href="http://www.d10e.org/">the d10e conference</a> in San Francisco, the second long-awaited presentation of their staff will take place.

      Mouse explained that the hardware will be updated in the machine and the Odroid Xu4 will be installed instead of the Raspberry Pi.  According to Mouse, the machine will prepare just for the conference d10e, and it will run 4-5 times faster. <br><br>  If someone does not know, the Dash'n'Drink device that they are adopting, which takes DASH, was conceived in December 2015 <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/post/275133/">as</a> <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/post/276969/">an open source project</a> .  It was funded through the integrated system of decentralized self-government and self-financing of Dash. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  In January 2016, Mouse and Evard spoke in detail about the project to Eric Sammons from Bitcoin.com.  They said: ‚ÄúWe submitted the project for consideration in the Dash budgeting system.  During the week, he received enough votes, and he was successfully financed directly from the blockchain. ‚Äù <br><br>  For those who are not familiar with Dash cryptocurrency, I will explain.  This is a private digital currency with instant transactions.  It is based on Bitcoin code, but has a two-tier network with a number of improvements.  <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/post/301614/">Dash implements a decentralized management model</a> .  Projects are put to vote.  Masternodes owners who also receive a DASH for maintaining the work of a node or node, vote to ensure the development of the project or reject it. <br><br>  Mouse explained that they wanted to demonstrate the capabilities of InstantSend, that is, to show that Dash can instantly send money without the problem of "double spending." <br>  DashnDrink was first shown at the North American Bitcoin Conference in Miami at the end of January 2016, where participants safely bought drinks at the machine, paying for DASH, and this procedure took only a few seconds. <br><br>  This was made possible thanks to the InstantSend Dash technology. <br>  In September 2014, Evan Duffield, Dash Key Developer, Holger Schinzel, Dash Quality Management System Manager and Fernando Gutierrez released technical documentation on this technology under the heading <a href="https://www.dash.org/instantx/">"Confirmation of Transactions and the Mastrodn Network: A Mechanism to Counter Double Spending Attacks</a> . <a href="https://www.dash.org/instantx/">"</a>  In short, the instant confirmation (or almost instantaneous) of the payment in the Dash system is possible thanks to the reliable Masternod infrastructure - it guarantees that the network will always work efficiently.  And thus, the registration of transactions and the consensus on the Masternod network help instantly complete a transaction protected from double spending. <br><br>  The 2014 documentation stated that ‚Äúin most cases, the network confirms the transaction within a few seconds after the start of sending‚Äù.  In 2016, a machine with carbonated drinks proved this in practice. <br>  The first machine was equipped with a Raspberry Pi, which was programmed to use InstantSend, and it was collected for two months.  ‚ÄúA decent achievement in such a period,‚Äù said Mouse.  Now he is also developing a solution for making payments from mobile devices called Dash'n'Go. <br><br>  Dash'n'Drink still remained in the shadows, although it is a living proof of the solution to the fundamental problem of Bitcoin - the implementation of secure instant transactions. <br>  Now he is back in the light (from Evard's garage, where he stood before heading to a conference in Miami).  And this is probably the very moment when enthusiasts, supporters and investors from the digital currency field will once again recall that <a href="https://www.dash.org/ru/">Dash</a> and the capabilities of its InstantSend technology are ready to change the existing order of things. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/304144/">https://habr.com/ru/post/304144/</a></p>
