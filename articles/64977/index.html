  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How not to do a startup or how to squander $ 160,000</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  I tell you the story of his failed "startup". <br>  About 2 years ago, at the very beginning of the crisis in the States, I decided to leave the construction I was engaged in at that moment and go online.  Why I decided to do this;  My brother at that time for about 3 years zashibal decent money online, and that's pulled me. <br>  On the Internet, I was not a novice, I already knew something about seo and so on trifles.  The decision was one, you need to do a project.  A domain name was found that meant nothing but was easily remembered. <br>  At that time, I did not understand how much money I needed for a startup that I wanted to run.  I had about $ 160k green.  I expected that this would be enough for 3 months, and then the project will begin to pay for itself.  (and if not, attract investment =)) <br>  It was written TK, if the ego at all can be called that.  An office of 600 square meters in area costing $ 7,500 per month + utilities of about $ 1,000 per month was filmed.  It was decided to repair the office, which spent about $ 15,000 + on office furniture and equipment $ 7.000 <br>  I hired 4 workers, 1 designer, 2 programmers and 1 mover, for writing content and for other small things. <br>  People cost me $ 10,000 per month.  After 2 months, it became clear that we would not do anything ourselves, and it was decided to hire a company that would make the project to order, after which we would promote it. <br>  It turned out that my brother has an acquaintance who used the services of such an office more than once.  It seems like a serious office ... Well, that said, it's done.  All communication with this office went through this friend.  The project was promised to be completed on a turnkey basis in 3 months.  After 2 months, it turned out that nothing had been done at all.  30% of the deposit was already paid, which was $ 7,500. <br>  By that time, I began to understand with horror that nothing would work out.  The money ran out, the project is not. <br><br>  What have I learned from this? <br>  You need to be realistic and understand that no project will not pay for itself immediately after creation. <br>  Do not really create anything worth 3-5 months. <br>  If I place a sum of less than 1m, the project should start on my knees, without renting an office and buying equipment. <br>  Save on everything. <br>  You need to be on the topic at 100%. <br>  Never work through anyone, only directly. <br><br>  Now, after a little more than 2 years, I understand all this.  I could get out and find the strength not to leave online.  Implemented a small project that brings a stable income and does not require large expenditures. <br>  I am engaged in another startup for which I have been preparing for about a year and now, like, 8 months in development.  After 2 months it is planned to enter the closed testing.  This is not a project where you plan to reach an audience, and then think about how to make money on them. <br>  At the moment, you can <a href="http://idooble.com/">subscribe to invites</a> .  A <a href="http://contest.idooble.com/">promo website was</a> also made, which I will start to advertise 2 months before the official opening.
