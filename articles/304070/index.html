      <i>I usually write just one or two emails per day ‚Äî that's all.</i>  <i>I also do not abuse talking on the phone.</i>  <i>I am extremely selective in contacts, and some <a href="http://blog.mbaconsult.ru/blog/personal/7-sovetov-pomogayushchikh-izbavitsya-ot-sotsiofobii/">people think that I am not communicative</a> .</i>  <i>When I founded Chobani, nobody knew me, I was free and devoted myself entirely to what I was doing.</i>  <i>But as the business grew, I began to attract more attention to myself, until I finally realized that the whole world was trying to get my time.</i>  <i>It flatters.</i>  <i>But every time you devote your time to the world, you <a href="http://blog.mbaconsult.ru/blog/karera/kak-regulyarno-davat-fidbek-i-vse-zhe-vypolnyat-svoyu-rabotu/">take it away from your business</a> .</i>  <i>It does not please me.</i>  <i>Most weekends I spend in the north of the country [in New York].</i>  <i>The walk I make in the evenings is like a prayer.</i>  <i>In the city, the walk becomes my salvation.</i>  <i>Sometimes I go to a bookstore on Prince Street, pick a book, come home and just lie on the floor.</i> <br><br>  TIME OF AWAKENING: <br><blockquote>  Between 7 and 8 in the morning. </blockquote><br>  FIRST MORNING ACTION: <br><blockquote>  I stay in bed and toss and turn.  It takes about 30 - 45 minutes, then I get up.  For breakfast, I usually have Chobani blueberries, but if time allows, then I make an amazing Turkish breakfast with eggs, feta cheese and basturma. </blockquote><br>  PHILOSOPHY: <br><blockquote>  Never stop being an ordinary person.  I still drive my car and shop.  This is largely reflected in who I am, who I hire, and where I draw my ideas. </blockquote><br>  DINNER: <br><blockquote>  If I'm in the north of the United States, then I'm just going home.  But in the city I have lunch with my colleagues.  Talking for food has a special mystical power.  This is the Turkish and Mediterranean style of doing business. </blockquote><br>  DO YOU MAKE A BREAK FOR THE DAY? <br><blockquote>  If you are near the Spring and Crosby building and you see a crazy guy in headphones spinning circles on the street, then you should know - this is me talking to someone about the business.  If I do not speak, then I listen to music. </blockquote><br>  BEST HABIT: <br><blockquote>  My best habit is to walk.  I love nature.  This love is explained by the fact that I grew up in the mountainous countryside of Turkey. </blockquote><br>  WORST HABIT: <br><blockquote>  I smoke, although now I quit.  Three months left.  I hate smoking and almost got rid of this habit. </blockquote><br>  LAST ACTION BEFORE WASTING TO SNU: <br><blockquote>  If I am in the north of the country, before I go home, I look at the stars.  It reminds me that I'm just a tiny bit of a huge universe.  I can also watch new movies on an Apple TV or laptop.  I am currently watching Mad Men (Mad Men). </blockquote><br>  BEDTIME: <br><blockquote>  Between 12:30 and 1.00 at night. </blockquote><br>  - Interview taken by JM <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0071c5">7. ‚ÄúIf the issue is not on the agenda, we do not discuss it‚Äù</font> </h2><br><br>  <b>Adora Cheung</b> <br>  CEO of Homejoy. <br><br>  <i>In those companies where I once worked, <a href="http://blog.mbaconsult.ru/blog/personal/3-cheloveka-sposobnykh-svesti-produktivnost-soveshchaniy-k-nulyu/">meetings seemed to last forever</a> .</i>  <i>Everyone considered it necessary to raise questions that came to mind in the past 24 hours.</i>  <i>At Homejoy, we created a document in Google Doc for each working meeting, and I ask the staff to add their ideas [during the week] and questions that they would like to discuss.</i>  <i>I look through the resulting document and prioritize the items that, in my opinion, are worthy of attention, and then, during the meeting, we simply go through the list.</i>  <i>If the question is not included in the adgendu, we do not touch it.</i> <br><br>  TIME OF AWAKENING: <br><blockquote>  7 am. </blockquote><br>  FIRST MORNING ACTION: <br><blockquote>  I plan my day and do not go to bed until I finish everything that was intended. </blockquote><br>  APPLICATIONS AND ACCESSORIES: <br><blockquote>  Sane Box (for sorting email), Post-its (for recordings during meetings), Evernote (for capturing random thoughts), Google calendar on your desktop, Sunrise on your mobile phone. </blockquote><br>  HOW ARE CASE OF E-MAIL: <br><blockquote>  I parse mail on the principle: arrived last - served first (LIFO). </blockquote><br>  WHAT IS YOU MOTIVATED? <br><blockquote>  Branded shirt cleaning company in which I used to work.  This is a reminder of how successful Homejoy is, and where I started. </blockquote><br>  BEST HABIT: <br><blockquote>  I do programming to relax.  My work requires high concentration, and I always do something that I believe will be useful.  Every weekend I spend one day just doing the programming.  For me, this is a <a href="http://blog.mbaconsult.ru/blog/personal/dzen-rannikh-probuzhdeniy-10-sposobov-zakrepleniya-utrennego-rituala/">kind of Zen</a> . </blockquote><br>  WORST HABIT: <br><blockquote>  I wake up in the middle of the night and check email or open Google Doc on my phone.  This is done instinctively.  If I wake up later than 5:00, I look at the benchmarks, because it is at this time that they are updated.  I started to struggle with myself and try to leave the phone away from the bedroom, but I still get up to take it. </blockquote><br>  LAST ACTION BEFORE WASTING TO SNU: <br><blockquote>  Check mail. </blockquote><br>  BEDTIME: <br><blockquote>  3 o'clock in the morning. </blockquote><br>  ‚ÄîThe interview was taken by Jillian Goodman. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0071c5">8. "I get rid of all the excess"</font> </h2><br>  <b>Gary Friedman</b> <br>  Chairman and CEO of Restoration Hardware. <br>  <i>One of the things I learned [starting my business] at Gap is that Mickey Drexler [at that time, the CEO of Gap Inc., and now J.Crew CEO], being a good listener, ask great questions, for example:</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>What are we doing right?</i>  <i>What nonsense we are doing?</i>  <i>What can affect margins?</i>  <i>What is really important and what is not?</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>Everyone wants to focus on the important things and get rid of the unimportant.</i>  <i>It is necessary to understand that in our activity is superfluous or unimportant, and stop this activity.</i>  <i>Large organizations are able to edit their activities.</i> <br><br>  TIME OF AWAKENING: <br><blockquote>  Between 5:30 and 6:30 in the morning. </blockquote><br>  FIRST MORNING ACTION: <br><blockquote>  Checking the data for yesterday on the iPad, which usually lies near my bed. </blockquote><br>  APPENDIX AND USEFUL TOOLS: <br><blockquote>  I have a well-developed visual memory, so I need to show everything schematically: on a blackboard or napkin.  I use the same handles because I am a little superstitious.  This may be an architectural marker, Pentel Sign.  I also use whatsapp and viber. </blockquote><br>  PHILOSOPHY: <br><blockquote>  The motto of our company: Think until it hurts, until you start to see what others do not see, and do what others cannot. </blockquote><br>  ATMOSPHERE IN WHICH YOU ARE MOST PRODUCTIVE: <br><blockquote>  I am most productive when there are a lot of people around, where ideas soar, discussions and debates take place.  But then I must be left completely alone for a few hours.  As a rule, I find solitude in a small place called New Morning Cafe, not far from me [Marin County], where I usually have breakfast. </blockquote><br>  WHAT IS YOU MOTIVATED? <br><blockquote>  In fact, this item I wear on my wrist - these are four bracelets.  The inscription on the first one reads: "Believe."  On the second there is a metal insert with an engraved loop, symbolizing infinite possibilities, infinity of ways to solve the problem, infinity of choice.  The third words are engraved: "Live and let others live."  When you judge someone, you, figuratively speaking, lower the curtains, and the light and information ceases to come to you.  The latter reflects what we call the ‚ÄúResto Rules‚Äù - our core beliefs: ‚ÄúVision is everything.  Love us or leave.  There is no unwelcoming road.  This is personal.  Speed ‚Äã‚Äãis limited only by ourselves. ‚Äù  These bracelets control me and my activities. </blockquote><br>  BEST HABIT: <br><blockquote>  Ask: "Something else?" </blockquote><br>  WORST HABIT: <br><blockquote>  I can be non-punctual. </blockquote><br>  LAST ACTION BEFORE SLEEP: <br><blockquote>  Checking mail, information, numbers. </blockquote><br>  BEDTIME: <br><blockquote>  2am. </blockquote><br>  - The interview was taken by Jeff Chu. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0071c5">9. "I do the exercises Zumba"</font> </h2><br>  <b>Velma Scantlebury, MD</b> <br>  Assistant Head of the Tissue Transplant Unit at the Christiana Care Health System (hospital network) in Newark, Delaware (during her medical practice, she performed more than 1,000 kidney transplants). <br><br>  <i>Listening to the rhythm of the heart is a monotonous exercise.</i>  <i>Usually we communicate, and everyone has favorite radio stations.</i>  <i>Sometimes I have large patients - with a weight of more than 110 kg and I have to use a step-chair to be higher, get to them and perform an operation.</i>  <i>Above the operating table are heavy lamps.</i>  <i>I keep a good physical shape, moving them at the right angle, going up and down for this from my chair-ladder.</i>  <i>It turns out that I am doing the Zumba exercises right during the operation.</i> <br><br>  TIME OF AWAKENING: <br><blockquote>  It all depends on what time I lay down.  Half the time I'm in touch.  It‚Äôs hard to say what time you woke up, if you had to answer calls several times or sit at a computer during the night. </blockquote><br>  FIRST MORNING ACTION: <br><blockquote>  Meditation.  If, of course, at the time of my awakening information does not come that a donor kidney is on the way. </blockquote><br>  ATMOSPHERE ASSISTING PRODUCTIVE WORK: <br><blockquote>  I like silence.  My parents live in New York, and I can go to them in absolute silence, alone with my thoughts.  Honestly, at such moments I can understand and mentally put in order a lot. </blockquote><br>  DO YOU MAKE A BREAK FOR THE DAY? <br><blockquote>  Our clinic is located a third of a mile from the place where we receive patients, so we constantly run back and forth.  So there is no need to take breaks. </blockquote><br>  WHAT IS YOU MOTIVATED? <br><blockquote>  The prayer book that was sent to me by the parents of the patient to whom we did the transplant.  He helps me stay focused.  Sometimes I think I have had enough, but the prayer book reminds me that we all have a purpose and purpose in life. </blockquote><br>  BEST HABIT: <br><blockquote>  Listen.  I like to listen. </blockquote><br>  LAST DEAL BEFORE WASTE FROM: <br><blockquote>  I pray. </blockquote><br>  BEDTIME <br><blockquote>  After midnight. </blockquote><br>  ‚ÄîInterview taken by Jillian Goodman. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0071c5">10. ‚ÄúI make lists‚Äù</font> </h2><br>  <b>Bobby Flay</b> <br>  Cook, restaurateur and leading employee of the food chain Beat Bobby Flay. <br><br>  <i>Regardless of whether I am preparing Thanksgiving dinner or inventing a new menu for Gato [new restaurant], I make lists.</i>  <i>When I cross out lines in it, I feel that I‚Äôm doing everything ‚Äúright‚Äù.</i>  <i>This is for me the only <a href="http://blog.mbaconsult.ru/blog/personal/kak-stat-vynoslivym-8-shagov-k-uspekhu-naperekor-slozhnostyam/">way to achieve the goal</a> .</i>  <i>This is not taught at school, but they simply kicked me out of the institute.</i>  <i>I can say for sure that that time was not particularly successful for me.</i>  <i>I learned the secrets of success much later.</i> <br>  TIME OF AWAKENING: <br><blockquote>  6 a.m. </blockquote><br>  FIRST MORNING MORNING: <br><blockquote>  I read The New York Times.  This newspaper.  I like the smell and the rustle of paper. </blockquote><br>  APPLICATIONS AND ACCESSORIES: <br><blockquote>  Yellow notepad.  I use it if I need to write a speech or make a list of ingredients or dishes. </blockquote><br>  HOW ARE CASE OF E-MAIL: <br><blockquote>  If I do not answer the letters immediately, I can just forget about them.  So I look at them again on the laptop at the end of the day. </blockquote><br>  WHAT IS YOU MOTIVATED? <br><blockquote>  A bottle of good bourbon - Woodford Reserve.  Always at the end of a hard day, I drink a little bourbon. </blockquote><br>  BEST HABIT: <br><blockquote>  I finish the job. </blockquote><br>  WORST HABIT: <br><blockquote>  I take on too many things.  I find it difficult to render to people. </blockquote><br>  LAST DEAL BEFORE WASTE FROM: <br><blockquote>  I am taking a shower. </blockquote><br>  BEDTIME: <br><blockquote>  Midnight. </blockquote><br>  - The interview was taken by Jeff Chu. <br><br>  PS We recommend another article on the topic - <a href="http://blog.mbaconsult.ru/blog/personal/10-shagov-kotorye-pomogut-vam-naslazhdatsya-zhiznyu/">10 steps to help you enjoy life</a> . <br><br>  Translated by Vyacheslav Davidenko, founder of <a href="http://www.mbaconsult.ru/">MBA Consult</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/304070/">https://habr.com/ru/post/304070/</a></p>
