    <hr><br>  <b>Elizabeth:</b> It really is not much different from any other media - in the sense of my work.  I worked before in traditional media - in Lenta.ru, RBC, Forbes.  And I try to build my editors according to similar rules.  It is clear that Kinopoisk media is very different from others, because it is rather a small media with a huge brand.  Our audience is about 40 million people per month, and the media read about 10% of this number.  This slightly changes your perception of work and life, because you need to be aware of the importance of media within this big brand, and you have a little less resources than usual. <br><br>  Where all editors work with their designers and with their development, we work with a common design and development, which still have a million tasks related to the product, business tasks, online cinema and so on.  But [work this way] is very interesting.  We are not a separate publication at Kinopoisk, but we are embedded in the work of the entire site. <br><br>  One of the first steps I took was to add editorial materials to the pages of films and people at Kinopoisk in normal form.  This is the main point from which people come to us.  They go from search engines to the page of a particular film or person and from there they are already switching to our materials.  Previously, they were presented there somewhere in the corner and very badly, but now we are watching this and deliberately display a lot of good materials.  There is a downside - as we bring traffic to the "Film Search".  Many people come from search engines and social networks, and in our materials with the update of the design - it happened last fall - object cards were added. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4OfaTONhprc" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  This is a short reference from the page of the movie or person that is embedded directly into the article.  Without going anywhere, you can click the button with the target action - add the movie to the expected ones (I will watch list), buy a ticket for this movie and watch it online. <br><br>  You do not need to go to the page of this film - you can read the material and immediately do something.  It works great, we see that people use it, and we develop it. <br><br><hr><br>  <i><b>A: You mentioned that KinoPoisk has a wider range of tasks.</b></i>  <i><b>Why, then, should Kinopoisk develop in the direction of the media?</b></i>  <i><b>It would seem that various media brands have already appeared, such as T ‚Äî F ‚Äî this is not something new.</b></i>  <i><b>On the other hand, it seems that KinoPoisk has a lot of content, and it is constantly generated by itself.</b></i>  <i><b>For some it seems that it is as if Habr was doing another media about Habr.</b></i> <i><b><br><br></b></i>  <i><b>Why did Kinopoisk decide to get involved in building its own media?</b></i> <br><br><hr><br>  <b>E:</b> Here are a few questions, I will try to answer in order. <br><br>  Why ‚ÄúKinoPoisku‚Äù media?  In general, indeed, very many nonmedical brands now go to this.  And this is an important sign that brands understand that they need a face and a voice. <br><br>  Usually this media becomes media, editorial.  It develops some kind of editorial policy and adheres to it.  She decides what to write about, what not to write about, how to write about it.  She communicates with users in the comments and social networks.  For KinoPoisk, this is all very important, because otherwise it‚Äôs just a site aggregator of user reviews, ratings and movie pages.  He once was so, but outgrown this state. <br><br>  In addition to the media, KinoPoisk has a billboard selling tickets and an online cinema.  This is all - the gradual development of the brand.  In general, we want to cover all the interests of people associated with the movie.  If you need specific information about the movie, you come to the movie page.  If you are interested in reading a little more detail or the first to find out some news about the film - there is media for you.  You buy tickets in the same place, add a movie to expectations, give a rating, write a review.  You watch the movie online there too. <br><br>  Ideally, we want to be [a service that covers everything].  We are already becoming them, but we want more and more people to realize this.  KinoPoisk today is not so much an encyclopedia of data as a great service dedicated to cinema and all interests related to cinema. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FRarsOGJRtE" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  Then you said about UGC.  Yes, we have a lot of it, but nevertheless I support the point of view that journalism is not yet blogging.  Today it differs from user content qualitatively, sometimes at times.  We have a lot of cool reviews, and we therefore do not exactly write our reviews of films, because we all have it all. <br><br>  We write other articles that reveal the history of cinema to people, help them to understand the film, to understand it.  We write news, in the end, users do not write news. <br><br>  The third is my personal considerations.  In my opinion, in Russia now there is no big media about cinema, which would tell not specifically about the author's films.  There is ‚ÄúThe Art of Cinema‚Äù, there is ‚ÄúSession‚Äù - such very old, cool magazines.  But they are more turned towards copyright and festival cinema.  And we write about different cinema - and about the "Avengers", and about the Berlin Film Festival.  And there are not so many such media outlets, but such large ones as we are - all along. <br><br>  And we understand that this niche is the interest. <br><br><hr><br>  <i><b>A: Is it possible to draw a conclusion - you started talking about it - that the emergence of your own media is an indicator of ‚Äúmaturity‚Äù and the development of a certain niche and brand?</b></i> <i><b><br><br></b></i>  <i><b>When a company realizes that it doesn‚Äôt just want to use reviews and what other people write on a free basis.</b></i>  <i><b>And when she is still around this makes educational, entertaining and generally useful content by specially trained people.</b></i> <br><br><hr><br>  <b>E:</b> Yes, but I think that not all brands need it. <br><br>  Not everybody has to run directly to the media.  It is difficult, expensive, and very often it seems that it does not justify the investment.  This is not marketing, where you invested a hundred rubles and received or did not receive 1500 transitions.  [Media] is a fashionable, important thing for some brands.  Especially for those who build themselves on communication with the audience and in general somehow turned to people.  Since KinoPoisk depends on the people turned to it, we try to communicate with them in the human language, and this is a media task. <br><br>  <b>A:</b> So in your opinion, [media] is more a story for B2C brands?  Those who are addressed to users, rather than B2B brands that do something for other companies. <br><br>  <b>E:</b> I generally always want everyone to communicate with each other in human language.  I hate the clerk, such a Soviet style, and I hate the advertising style. <br><br>  It seems to me that it is great when brands, both with companies and with users and readers, communicate in a distinct and good Russian language. <br><br><hr><br>  <i><b>A: If we say that this is still not marketing and is not measured straightforward - investments, transitions, targeted actions.</b></i>  <i><b>How do you define for yourself the success or failure of the task, direction or change that KinoPoisk is currently undergoing?</b></i> <br><br><hr><br>  <b>E:</b> It is clear that we still look at traditional metrics - views, share'y, comments sometimes.  Well, comments are a controversial metric.  It is clear that we rejoice when articles collect many views and unique visitors.  And in general, we see that our media is growing by the audience.  As in any other media, [the importance] of the importance of your materials is important - how people discuss them in social networks, how they are sown, how much they diverge. <br><br>  Another metric that is not typical of other media is the object cards that I talked about.  We look at how people react to them, what actions they take. <br><br>  We see that people have read the news about the trailer of the new Tarantino film, and there will be a lot of clicks on the ‚ÄúI will watch‚Äù button.  That is, people watched the trailer, they realized that they wanted to watch a movie, they pressed a button.  For us, this is a cool mechanic.  We can remind them later that the film is being released, offer them tickets or a movie online. <br><br>  We learn about the interest of users from what they read, and we can directly connect it with the business.  When I associated it with marketing, I meant that there is no direct link, as in performance marketing.  It is not necessary that the person read the article and bought a ticket. <br><br><blockquote>  We understand this perfectly.  But I think that he can read the article, remember that the film ‚ÄúRoyal Corgi‚Äù is coming out this weekend, and then he will come to the cinema and buy a ticket.  This is also great, it is also our task. </blockquote><br><hr><br>  <i><b>A: What do you think, how popular will this format of merging a certain service with content be in the future?</b></i>  <i><b>Your audience has the opportunity to watch a movie online, or to book tickets, or read about the actor.</b></i>  <i><b>Roughly speaking, this is the service part.</b></i>  <i><b>There are conditional media that do not have this service part, they just give some information.</b></i>  <i><b>In your opinion, will there be any reverse movement?</b></i>  <i><b>When will conditional useful cards, links, call-to-action buttons appear in the media?</b></i> <br><br><hr><br>  <b>E:</b> This question is much better than me, answered Ilya Dyer, the former publisher of Medusa.  He wrote a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/tintorero/posts/10158272133168327">big post</a> about the fact that in general media becomes a service, and if the media is not a service for its audience, then it does not need it.  Why?  Because today there is a huge amount of information around us.  For the attention of the reader, not only the media, but also bloggers, social networks - whatever you like, are fighting.  It is very difficult to catch a person and drag him to your site. <br><br>  It seems that exactly in this place the media should become services, become useful and offer some important information.  In fact, it is difficult to divide here.  Virtually any media now writes about movie premieres of the week.  This is more of a service thing.  You offer a person a choice.  You tell about your point of view, what he should pay attention to, but in general it is a poster, a schedule of films. <br><br>  <b>A:</b> That is, even the absence of some kind of direct infrastructure or service interface does not mean that this is not a service history? <br><br>  <b>E:</b> Of course.  The same ‚ÄúMedusa‚Äù makes the cards in the ‚ÄúAnalysis‚Äù section.  They are not so much about ordinary journalism, but about helping people.  To them to understand the complex bill, a situation;  understand how to change tires on the car.  This is also important.  We sometimes forget about the fact that we do not explain such basic things to some people. <br><br>  <b>A:</b> Does Kinopoisk have similar materials where you talk about understandable things that might not be obvious to the user? <br><br>  <b>E:</b> I don‚Äôt know how basic this is, but in fact this is the big task of our <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/kinopoisk">YouTube channel</a> and of our video department in general.  How do people watch movies?  For them, this is some kind of moving picture, actors, funny dialogue.  We looked, left the cinema and forgot. <br><br>  How are we trying to expand this story?  We are trying to explain to people how the language of cinema is arranged and how cinema with them at different levels talks, conveys some meanings.  And these are the things that are now in Russian-language YouTube, no one seems to be doing well.  Although it is a very popular thing in the West.  I will not hide, we did not come up with it.  The video essay was long before us on the western channels and is very popular there.  It just seems to us that this niche in Russia is not closed.  We want to close it.  Such educational, explaining content. <br><br>  Once we tried to do commercials about all sorts of cinema terms, but then we realized that the audience‚Äôs interest in them was not very big, and we refused it. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/T1jIEJ7VjUQ" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><hr><br>  <i><b>A: How do you define (besides the audience reaction - they watch a lot or a little) and form a policy on your channel, what to talk about?</b></i>  <i><b>How do you choose topics?</b></i> <br><br><hr><br>  <b>E:</b> We often make a start from the agenda anyway.  There may sometimes be a very distant connection.  For example, there is a new film with Viggo Mortensen (‚ÄúThe Green Book‚Äù), we are making a video about his career.  The anniversary of "Harry Potter" - we are doing a film about Harry Potter. <br><br>  Sometimes do not attach to this.  We just understand that there are some big and important topics, directors, films about which people are always pleased to watch.  We understand that this topic is pop, it will go right away.  Now we, for example, have made two videos about Tarantino.  This is obviously one of the most cult and most beloved directors in Russia.  These two clips scored a million views in total.  One will pick up [a million] myself soon. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/iisnsI1BrWE" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  <b>A:</b> And if you talk about the same movie with Tarantino, which you have one of the most popular on the channel - about the dialogues in the films of Tarantino. <br><br>  Suppose you have determined that it is situational, it is now interesting to tell you about Tarantino.  How do you choose what specifically to talk about?  What to get, what interesting things? <br><br>  <b>E:</b> The theme depends on the film and the director every time. <br><br>  It is clear that Tarantino is a master of dialogues, everyone knows this, everyone quotes him.  You probably know a few phrases from "Pulp Fiction" by heart.  I wanted to tell how he shows it in cinema and how he builds them in composition.  About it was a movie. <br><br>  Before that, there was a movie about how Tarantino quotes other films, because he is a big movie fancier.  A well-known story: he worked in a video salon, watched a lot of films, and therefore all his films are crammed with some kind of quotations, references, hints and so on.  Well, these are obvious things [for those who] know a little about movies. <br><br>  About Harry Potter.  When we discussed the video, we understood that people really love this franchise.  We always choose video topics related to films about which it is visually interesting to tell.  If the film is cult for some reason, but it is boring from a cinematic point of view, you will not tell much about it in the video. <br><br>  You can write the text and finish it.  Therefore, we chose the film ‚ÄúHarry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban‚Äù, which was shot by Kuaron and which is much more inventive and tough than the next films that everyone scolds.  We did not lose. <br><br>  It turned out that he has a lot of fans, for many people - this is a favorite film from the series, although they don‚Äôt even know why.  They just liked it, and we tried to explain to them why they love him so much.  Because it is cool shot. <br><br><hr><br>  <i><b>A: Do you have some kind of mind map or ‚Äúsupermegaplan‚Äù from the series: we have this film, we will write a text article about this one, this film will be parsed, we will parse this podcast and so on?</b></i> <br><br><hr><br>  <b>E:</b> Of course.  Once a month we meet and discuss the plan for the next month.  In early March, we discuss what we do in April and so on.  Cinema is pretty simple.  If nothing extraordinary happens, you know which films are being released, which series are coming out, which anniversaries actors and films will have.  Based on this, we are already building the original plan.  It is clear that something is being corrected, something is falling off, something is being thought up later or appears situationally.  We are much less dependent on the situation than the usual media that live on a daily agenda. <br><br>  Therefore, yes, there is such a plan.  Sometimes, if this is a big movie, we can tell about it with text, video, podcast, and social networks to make a joke. <br><br>  We do not have such a hard [limit].  Next, we proceed from the format.  If this video - the film should be interesting cinematically, as I said.  If this is a podcast - [the film should be something], which would be cool to talk about.  Now we have launched a <a href="https://www.kinopoisk.ru/photostory/3337977/">music podcast</a> , which means [there should be an interesting twist on this side.  And you can write any text practically, from any side. <br><br><hr><br>  <i><b>A: You make both video, and audio, and texts - how big is your edition?</b></i> <br><br><hr><br>  <b>E:</b> Mostly, we have 13 people working.  Probably for me [the editorial board] is small, because I worked in Lenta, where there were 70 editors.  In RBC - even more.  In Forbes - a little less, but still a lot.  For me, this is the feeling of a small media.  But sometimes you compare with colleagues, and they say: "We have five people working." <br><br><blockquote>  We have three people out of thirteen - video department.  Video is a costly thing, really expensive.  First of all, from the point of view of people. </blockquote><br>  <b>A:</b> It turns out that, in essence, KinoPoisk introduced a capsule model of a small media.  It not only exists autonomously, but also constantly interacts with other departments, is in the process of introducing additional interface or service solutions.  It seems to me that this is very cool, and an excellent example of how content can be extremely helpful even where there seems to be quite a lot of content already. <br><br>  <b>E:</b> Thank you. <br><br><hr><br>  <i><b>A: Now how many podcasts do you have?</b></i>  <i><b>If you go back to them.</b></i> <br><br><hr><br>  <b>E:</b> We already have two podcasts published, and so far there will be two. <br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Here I must say that we tried to enter [the audio market] a couple of years ago, when there was a HYIP related to the first podcasts - ‚ÄúMedusa‚Äù, ‚ÄúArzamas‚Äù. We somehow decided to run there too, but we didn‚Äôt really succeed. There were several reasons for this. First, for some reason we decided that the podcast should be done about the old movie. About Soviet cinema, people are still alive who have something to do with it. It seemed to us very important and interesting.</font></font><br><br>  And there is.<font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The problem is that, unfortunately, this does not fit into the podcast, because very often these people are elderly, and it is difficult for them to talk. They are hard to listen to, even if they tell interesting things. It turned out that in text format it would be much cooler. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">We had more attempts to record conversational podcasts, but each time we lacked enough motivated hosts. At the beginning of this year, I realized that I began to watch a lot of TV shows - for work and not. I really want to discuss them with someone. </font></font><br><br> <b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">A:</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> It's cool when you need to watch TV shows for work. </font></font><br><br> <b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">E:</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> Yes, yes. That is why at some point I chose this work for myself. I decided that in any case I‚Äôm looking at it, I‚Äôm thrilled, why not connect my career with it.</font></font><br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-kwstY-8fmY" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  So here.<font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I realized that I watch a lot of TV shows, I really want to talk with someone about them, everyone is discussing them around. It's cool, and we have a serial boom in recent years. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I have a friend - Ivan Filippov, also a journalist, producer, writes for various publications, and for us as well. In particular, he runs the channel " </font></font><a href="https://t.me/zapasaemsyapopkornom"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Stocking Popcorn</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> ", one of the most popular TV shows in Telegram. I suggested to him, he also liked this idea, and from the end of January we started writing a podcast about serials. We are discussing new products, what we saw, what we think about it, some important news. </font></font><br><br> <b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">A:</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> Does editorial policy dominate you at this moment? Do you have limitations - what can be discussed, what is not worth it and how? </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">E: I am the editor-in-chief, and I run a podcast - do I put myself on myself?</font></font> Not.<font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">We do not swear in the podcast simply for reasons of decency, but our topics are not limited. We have no censorship and no list of what cannot be discussed. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The second podcast came up with my husband and for a long time urged me to do it. At first I really didn‚Äôt want to, because I remembered our previous experience with podcasts, I was afraid that it would be bad and no one would burn with it. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Then the podcast somehow formed itself. Lead his music critic Lev Gankin, also my good friend and a brilliant music journalist. He talks about the music in the cinema, about the composers, about the soundtracks, about why such music is chosen for the cinema.</font></font><br><br><blockquote><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">We just recently launched [this] podcast - ‚Äú </font></font><a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/ru/podcast/%25D1%2588%25D1%2583%25D0%25BC-%25D0%25B8-%25D1%258F%25D1%2580%25D0%25BA%25D0%25BE%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D1%258C/id1456109770"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Noise and Brightness</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> ‚Äù (the serial podcast is called ‚Äú </font></font><a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/ru/podcast/%25D0%25B2-%25D0%25BF%25D1%2580%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B4%25D1%258B%25D0%25B4%25D1%2583%25D1%2589%25D0%25B8%25D1%2585-%25D1%2581%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580%25D0%25B8%25D1%258F%25D1%2585/id1451484118"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In previous episodes</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> ‚Äù). </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In the first issue, Lev talks about the music in the series ‚ÄúThe Game of Thrones‚Äù and its composer Ramin Javadi. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It is very interesting, there are such things that I did not know. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Probably, I would not read them on purpose, but it‚Äôs pleasant to listen to 20 minutes and immediately hear this music. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">This is the perfect format for a podcast.</font></font></blockquote><br> <b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">A:</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> Yes, indeed. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">A podcast about music is like a YouTube channel about videos, where everything is more than complementary. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The format contributes to better learning what is being said. </font></font><br><br> <b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">E:</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> Yes.</font></font><br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/81uPjvhhzUM" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><hr><br> <i><b>:      ‚Äî    ,  ? ,   ,     : ¬´  ,    ¬ª. <br><br> ,       ?</b></i> <br><br><hr><br> <b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">E:</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> Most of what we do is the idea we have suffered and what we are burning and what we want to do. The marketing department never comes to us and, thank God, our editorial board is independent. No one can order us to do some kind of format. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Some ideas are offered by colleagues, that's great. Just in a friendly format they say: "Do not want to do something like that?". We do, if we like. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Podcasts are exactly why it turns out that now someone is burning them, in particular me. It became interesting to me, I‚Äôm interested in recording them myself - so they drive and grow. </font></font><br><br> <b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">A:</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> So we are here. </font></font><br><br> <b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">E:</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> Yes, and therefore I am here.
