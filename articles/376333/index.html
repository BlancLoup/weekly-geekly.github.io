  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How I made a humidifier with a 3D printer</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Initially, an ultrasonic humidifier was purchased to humidify the air in the apartment.  But after a while they began to notice white bloom on furniture and other surfaces - salts contained in water.  There was a question about replacing the ultrasonic humidifier with some other.  We decided to try to make it yourself. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  There was no exact project, and the first was a sector-wide set of 29 evaporator discs to match the size of the nightstand. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage3/84a/f8d/25e/84af8d25ee388117141e8e918a9e991a.jpg" alt="Discs"><br><br>  Later it was supposed to order a fiberglass aquarium under the design basis.  The printing of four sectors with interruptions took several days: the net printing time of one sector was 19 hours, about 1.7 kg of plastic were used.  During the printing of one sector there was a power outage, we had to reprint the rest separately.  The sectors were subsequently connected to each other with a soldering iron.  The set consists of 28 discs with a thickness of about a millimeter and a radius of 14.5 cm on one axis plus a gear 2 millimeters thick with 74 teeth. <br>  A plastic container was used as a container with water.

    <img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage3/496/633/f1f/496633f1fa37d555fbbc87fca1ac2f0b.png" alt="Container"><br><br>  In its lid a hole was cut through almost the entire area so that only a couple of centimeters around the perimeter remained.  The second such container went on increasing the height of the device: about half the height was cut from it and planted with the help of hot melt on the cover of the first one in an inverted form.  Its bottom became the cover of the humidifier, a hole was cut in the wall for the release of humid air, on top of it there were holes for the entry of air, as well as a mechanism for rotating the discs.  The plastic of the container is fragile, the knife goes tight and can suddenly break, perhaps it would be better to melt the necessary holes with a soldering iron. <br>  The discs themselves are suspended on the walls of the lower container with the help of such brackets with cutouts that allow you to quickly remove and install the rotating part. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage3/e7e/8bf/ceb/e7e8bfcebabf019467f15bc3327a8666.png" alt="Brackets"><br><br>  Such a suspension is good in that water can be poured above the axis of the discs, so that it lasts longer.  Lubrication is not applicable.  The discs and all the orange parts are made of PLA, the rest are white ABS. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage3/e08/085/d70/e08085d7056cd8ede2c329b1ee9be1c1.png" alt="Discs are suspended"><br><br>  In the interior of the humidifier cover there are two gears on the same axis with a gear ratio of approximately 1: 4, which have teeth that differ significantly in size: very small (as many as 178) accept rotation from the gearbox located on top of the cover, and large (only 9) transmit rotation drives. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage3/d03/64b/290/d0364b290cbd30c2b4d52d366ad7d6b1.png" alt="Gears"><br><br>  The reducer located on the lid was used by the factory (taken from the old scanner) due to the low noise that the experimental samples printed on the printer could not achieve.  A fan from a computer case with broken blades was used as a silent engine, and a roller from an old tape recorder was glued to it.  Such an engine has one drawback: it cannot unwind itself, you have to push it after turning it on.  The rubber belt transfers rotation from the former fan to the big roller, which in turn rotates the gears of the gearbox.  Air is blown by two low-voltage fans to reduce noise. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage3/54d/4a3/bfe/54d4a3bfed5ac769b039fa80a0316850.png" alt="Gearbox and fans"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage3/43b/ed5/04d/43bed504d5165465e352963b6242fa9f.png" alt="General form"><br><br>  And for a snack video of work: <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/acqnpW8cdBw%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700023,15700186,15700190,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhiQMpu5xW3QTKxEdHu_QtY7L2khcA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  The humidifier has been operating without complaints for several months, evaporating about four to five liters of water a day, which is no different from the ultrasound humidifier used before, new salt deposits on the furniture are not formed. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/376333/">https://habr.com/ru/post/376333/</a></p>
