A modern toothbrush can communicate with a smartphone, make recommendations for cleaning teeth, keep statistics and entertain during morning and evening exercise. <br><br> <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/mvideo/blog/287230/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/21a/371/126/21a371126b00ad4d2326fd7f0391cf96.jpg"></a> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Let's start in the classics - with historical reference.  More than one and a half thousand years have passed since people began to use a sprig of Arak tree to clean their teeth.  The toothbrush of a classical type could be observed from the 15th century AD, but only about 80 years ago artificial bristles were invented, which became an essential attribute of all brushes. <br><br>  The first serial electric toothbrush began to be sold in the 60s of the last century.  Well, modern models, as we found out, can communicate with a smartphone via Bluetooth, make recommendations on cleaning teeth, keep statistics and even entertain along the way.

      The electric toothbrush, which will be discussed in this review, the <a href="http://www.mvideo.ru/products/elektricheskaya-zubnaya-shhetka-braun-oral-b-genius-9000-d701-545-6xc-black-20036741">Braun Oral-B Genius</a> is just like a food processor among mixers and blenders.  This is a modern complex, which includes both the brush itself and various accessories to it.  As a result, the teeth cleaning procedure should take place on a completely different level, the manufacturer promises us.  The brush connects to the smartphone via Bluetooth and with the installed Oral-B App (for iOS and <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details%3Fid%3Dcom.pg.oralb.oralbapp">Android</a> ) can play the role of a personal dental consultant who will give recommendations and monitor the correctness of tooth brushing. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#ec2028">Brush Features</font> </h2><br>  Even without high technology, <a href="http://www.mvideo.ru/products/elektricheskaya-zubnaya-shhetka-braun-oral-b-genius-9000-d701-545-6xc-black-20036741">Braun Oral-B Genius 9000</a> is a fairly powerful tool in the fight for the health and beauty of teeth.  The brush has six different modes of operation, which are selected using the button on the handle of the gadget and highlighted by the corresponding icon: <br><br><ul><li>  Daily cleaning - the standard mode for daily oral care. </li><li>  Professional cleaning - more intensive mode, provides more rotational and pulsating movements. </li><li>  Delicate cleaning - gentle, suitable for gentle cleaning of sensitive teeth and gums. </li><li>  3D White - used for polishing teeth. </li><li>  Gum care - mode for a soft massage of the gums. </li><li>  Language hygiene - mode for cleansing the tongue. </li></ul><br>  And if you have not tried to brush your teeth with an electric brush, we recommend that you try.  The result even from the simplest models is noticeably different from what the ‚Äúanalog‚Äù brush does. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/bc0/836/aee/bc0836aeee22c278d1a92dc6542fbcec.jpg"></div><br>  Working with them is so intuitive that any user of modern technology will have no difficulty in understanding without instructions. <br><br>  Returning to the review hero, the Braun brush, the timer works in two modes: two-minute and professional.  In the first case, it only counts the recommended period for brushing your teeth (2 minutes), noting its end by vibration and blinking of the backlight.  In the second, the timer is programmed for the same 2 minutes, but it signals once every 30 or 20 seconds: it is considered that the oral cavity can be approximately divided into 4 or 6 parts, and intermediate alerts indicate that it is time to move on to the next zone. <br><br>  The brush has a practical three-segment charge indicator, which will tell you exactly when the brush should be put on charge.  At the same time one full battery charge lasts for 12 days (2 minutes, 2 times a day). <br><br><h2>  <font color="#ec2028">Special features</font> </h2><br>  An important point is safety when brushing your teeth.  Tooth enamel is strong, but with a rough impact it can be damaged.  How to avoid it?  After turning on the brush, a white ring lights up around the nozzle (its color can be changed, there are a total of 12 backlight options available), which indicates the normal cleaning mode. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/075/212/d7e/075212d7e02f8562ffa90f6da40a2e7a.jpg"></div><br>  The brush itself will signal the excessive diligence of the user: the color of the ‚Äúsmart ring‚Äù will change to red, the nozzle with a small click will move away from the teeth, and a corresponding warning will appear on the smartphone screen (if it is connected to the device). <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/825/bb8/f27/825bb8f27ab56fc5ebaa98d292ac6391.jpg" height="650"></div><br><h2>  <font color="#ec2028">Equipment</font> </h2><br>  A complete set of Braun 9000 can not be called scanty.  In addition to the brush itself, the kit includes a box for storing four different nozzles and the nozzles themselves, standard charging, a bracket with a suction cup to attach the smartphone to the mirror, and a transport box with its own charger. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/b5f/d57/842/b5fd5784214613e31b199e1d798da45a.jpg"></div><br>  Nozzles differ in purpose: advanced and gentle are used for cleaning, Oral-B FlossAction removes plaque between teeth, and Oral-B 3D White is best suited for whitening. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/66e/138/ed6/66e138ed6080df72b20548fceff52a1e.jpg"></div><br>  The transport box accommodates a brush and 2 nozzles and, when open, serves as a stand for a smartphone.  When the charger is connected, the accessory can be used to recharge the smartphone ‚Äî an additional USB connector is provided for this. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/5f1/d38/447/5f1d3844769293a245d8dbe5f12210e5.jpg"></div><br>  Holes on the side of the case provide air circulation: a wet brush dries quickly and does not sopret.  The container itself is easy to clean: traces of toothpaste, which may eventually appear on the surface, are easily erased with a damp cloth. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/6b3/f74/f76/6b3f74f761e81892cd11f81e2d94e9e8.jpg"></div><br>  Compared to other accessories, the travel box looks quite large, although in fact it is only slightly larger than a standard can of shaving gel. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/3d8/e0e/707/3d8e0e707b67a74849a1ab81b3d4c625.jpg"></div><br>  The holder for the smartphone is attached to any surface - for example, a bathroom mirror.  The correct location of the smartphone on the mirror is required for the correct operation of the cleaning control mode.  But more about that below. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/f1a/5fb/683/f1a5fb6838ca4d01cf74433ec867529c.jpg"></div><br><h2>  <font color="#ec2028">Application features</font> </h2><br>  Most of the features of the complex Oral-B Genius 9000 lies in the application for a smartphone.  By installing the program and connecting a toothbrush, you can almost immediately get the first recommendations. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/c0e/faf/a73/c0efafa730020e7a608c7974a25ff336.jpg" height="650"></div><br>  Special sensors located on the brush and the recognition function activated by the front camera of the smartphone located on the holder on the mirror allow you to fully control the cleaning process.  Sensors monitor whether all areas of the oral cavity and whether the owner of the brush paid attention to the extent required.  If a section is missed, the gadget will notify you with a sound signal and will display a warning on the smartphone. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/2d8/703/1c4/2d87031c4eeb7ce7820416cc5e723ca0.jpg" height="650"></div><br>  The cleaning time is displayed on the smartphone screen, above the news feed.  It also displays all the tips and warnings. <br><br>  Over time, the tips become more personalized: Genius collects and analyzes information about how its owner brushes teeth, offers to use complex programs (fresh breath, bleaching, gum health and others) and monitors their implementation.  The application even takes into account such details: for example, with which hand it is more convenient for the user to hold a brush, whether he wears braces, etc. The Oral-B App database also contains various background information. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/343/f65/b8c/343f65b8c37840d7036f95618a2e7121.jpg" height="650"></div><br>  Well, RPG lovers will appreciate the achievements section, which displays the whole story and progress. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/3bd/20f/313/3bd20f313ecbba4f1c0f279c81c6cc1d.jpg" height="650"></div><br>  Using the application, you can change the settings of the brush, for example, select the color for highlighting the ring of the smart ring, enable or disable vibration, switch between modes. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/e1c/1a8/4cd/e1c1a84cdd1385df7ddc80aa71384f3d.jpg"></div><br><h2>  <font color="#ec2028">What is the result</font> </h2><br>  In general, the <a href="http://www.mvideo.ru/products/elektricheskaya-zubnaya-shhetka-braun-oral-b-genius-9000-d701-545-6xc-black-20036741">Braun Oral-B Genius 9000</a> electric toothbrush turned out to be interesting.  The element of the game was introduced into the traditional ritual of brushing teeth (remember the section "achievements") and the recommendations of dentists were added.  At the same time, the cleaning process was streamlined, and personal care programs appeared. <br><br>  Travel lovers or those who frequently go on business trips will certainly appreciate the package bundle and the ability to recharge gadgets from the USB port built into the box.  At the same time, the work of the toothbrush in the classical sense has not changed - everything functions without a smartphone. <br><br>  Yes, such a "smart" gadget can not be cheap.  But another thing is important: you can enjoy the process of brushing your teeth.  Although in the light of the universal attachment of people to smartphones, sometimes you want some satisfied intimate procedures, like brushing your teeth, to occur without the participation of smart electronics. <img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/fa7/d16/199/fa7d16199fca4fee89c0b96fa9919513.png"></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/402515/">https://habr.com/ru/post/402515/</a></p>
