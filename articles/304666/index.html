    <h5>  How the book is arranged </h5><br>  The chapters of the book are arranged in a specific order.  First, there is a presentation of all the main technologies discussed in the book, and then the process of installing them on a server designed for developing web applications is described in order to prepare the reader for practical work with examples. <br><br>  The first part of the book presents the basics of the PHP programming language, including the basics of syntax, arrays, functions, and object-oriented programming.  Then, after mastering the basics of PHP, you can proceed to the introduction to the MySQL database management system, consideration of which begins with the study of the structure of the MySQL database and ends with the preparation of complex queries. <br><br>  After this, it tells you how to use a combination of PHP and MySQL to start creating your own dynamic web pages by integrating HTML into this combination of forms and other functionality.  Then, the details of the practical aspects of development in PHP and MySQL will be considered, including a description of various useful functions and ways of working with cookies and sessions, as well as ways to maintain a high level of security. <br><br>  The next few chapters cover the basics of JavaScript, starting with simple functions and event handling and ending with access to the Document Object Model (DOM), validation of input data and error handling in the browser.  This is a comprehensive tutorial for those who are embarking on using the popular jQuery library for JavaScript. <br><br>  After reviewing the underlying technologies, ways of creating background AJAX calls and turning sites into a highly dynamic environment are described.  After that, you will have to learn two more chapters that discuss how to use CSS for styling and formatting your web pages, and describe new features embedded in HTML 5, including geolocation, audio, video, and canvas. <br><br>  After receiving all this information, you can create a complete set of programs, which in the aggregate is a workable social networking site.  As the material is presented, a large number of instructions and tips are given to develop a good programming style, as well as tips that will help readers discover and eliminate hidden programming errors.  In addition, many links are made to sites with additional materials related to the topics covered. <br><br>  More information about the book can be found on <a href="http://www.piter.com/collection/all/product/sozdaem-dinamicheskie-veb-sayty-s-pomoschyu-php-mysql-javascript-css-i-html5-4-e-izd">the publisher's website.</a> <br>  <a href="http://storage.piter.com/upload/contents/978549602146/978549602146_X.pdf">Table of contents</a> <br>  <a href="http://storage.piter.com/upload/contents/978549602146/978549602146_p.pdf">Excerpt</a> <br><br>  For Habrozhiteley 25% coupon discount - <b>ph_piter</b> <br>  + As an additional literature, an e-book by Semmy Pyruvala, <a href="http://www.piter.com/collection/all/product/osnovy-razrabotki-veb-prilozheniy">‚ÄúBasics of Web Application Development‚Äù, is attached.</a> <br><br>  You can also use the coupon <b>ph_piter</b> , giving a discount of 3000 rubles.  on the website Netology for an online program: <br>  <a href="http://netology.ru/programs/html-javascript">"JavaScript Development: Creating Interactive Web Pages"</a> <br><br>  The goal of the program is to make beginners from HTML-layout of competent front-end developers.
