I hope this post will be useful to those who want to get a Western MBA, hesitates or strongly does not want to do this. <br><br>  I studied at Warwick Business School in England.  Warwick MBA is a rating program, ranking 42nd according to the Financial Times rating and 34th according to Which MBA rating (The economist).  I studied full time (full time) for one year from September 2009 to September 2010. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/071c5c75/214b9d70/226b46eb/38f1b5f5.jpg"><br>  One of the buildings of the business school

      <b>Load</b> <br><br>  The study load was very serious.  Classes were held 5 days a week from 9 am to 6 pm with lunch breaks and coffee breaks, plus group work after lectures.  It was necessary to participate in at least 3 different groups of different sizes (5-9 people) in various subjects.  For the first 2 semesters, I did not find time for anything, neither for social events, nor for social activities.  For comparison, in my previous training at Master (MSc IT) also in England, I attended only 1-2 lectures a day, and the rest of the time was allocated for independent work.  I had enough free time.  But the MBA concept of free time does not exist. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/4862e89b/783726f8/e220f3cd/dde7c24e.jpg"><br>  Warwick Business School central building <br>  <b>Academic program</b> <br><br>  The academic program was very rich.  In total, we had 14 items - modules.  6 modules were core (core), 8 modules to choose from (electives).  The MBA differs from other programs in that it provides basic knowledge in various areas related directly or indirectly to management and finance.  Here are some of the subjects that I studied: Marketing, Accounting and Finance, Human Resource Management, Production Management, Business Strategy, Investments, Economics, etc. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/ad613cfc/d1b7fac8/dbec4d3f/6179262c.jpg"><br>  Module Finance for Entrepreneurs (Entrepreneurial Finance) <br><br>  It should be recognized that the level of academic modules and teaching was different.  Some lecturers were brilliant academics, world-famous professors, work experience in large companies, authors of their own books.  Such modules were interesting to visit.  Each lecture provoked heated discussions, aroused a desire to learn further and deeper.  But there were also such lecturers who surprised by their low level of training and teaching.  It seemed that some professors do not fit into the MBA model, do not understand the basic concept of a bias towards practice.  Teachers taught such theoretical models and concepts that are either outdated or simply do not work in real life.  On the other hand, we understood that this is an inevitable and necessary element of the academic program and the degree that we eventually received.  The poor quality of teaching was the exception to the rule and did not spoil the overall impression of the program.  Moreover, everything is known in comparison.  These modules looked pale in comparison with other brilliant modules, but could be quite a good level in comparison with other business schools or universities. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/6ef7859b/b8f6b30a/76efaab2/2b72b0c8.jpg"><br>  Computer class for business school students <br><br>  <b>Practical approach</b> <br><br>  From the first classes I realized that the MBA is very different from other academic programs.  The inclination to practice was felt in everything.  The first week began with team building sessions, where consultants gave us different tasks and problems, observed how we work, gave advice and taught how to work in a team.  This laid the foundation for our future teamwork.  After that weekly so-called career sessions were held.  At these sessions, we were taught practical skills that may come in handy in our careers, but do not fit the classical academic disciplines.  For example, we were taught topics such as business etiquette, business networking, presentation skills, negotiation skills, and interviewing skills, project management, mixing theoretical sessions with practical exercises and teamwork.  Also part of the career services (services provided by the business school to improve job search skills) were various lectures from practitioners and consultants from various fields and industries, people who have experience in decades and have achieved significant results.  In addition, individual and group sections were conducted with consultants and trainers who helped build a career development strategy for each student. <br><br>  During the training program, we had the opportunity to visit several companies and observe how the leaders of their industries work.  One of the interesting visits was a visit to Johnson Control Automotive, a supplier of first-level auto parts for Toyota.  The plant we visited produces seats for Toyota vehicles.  The purpose of this visit was to observe how companies organize and manage conveyor production, use the Japanese quality system and manage the supply chain. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/03f7d674/f9f83f72/a5ae0442/c134862b.jpg"><br>  Johnson Control Automotive Production Line <br><br>  Another interesting event was the visit of the Unipart company to a large logistics company that supplies spare parts worldwide for companies such as Jaguar Land Rover, McLaren, etc.  The purpose of this visit was to observe how lean management in real conditions works. <br><br>  <b>Real projects</b> <br><br>  During the year I was able to participate in two projects involving real companies.  The program was designed to give students the opportunity to consolidate their knowledge in real business conditions.  The first project was in the framework of the Practice Management module.  At the beginning of the first semester, 12 groups of 4-5 people are assigned client companies with a specific business problem.  The customers were mainly local charity or community companies.  The client that went to my group was a charitable organization to help developing countries endure military conflicts or natural disasters.  As part of this project, it was necessary to develop a marketing strategy to promote the company on the Internet and social networks.  During 2 semesters, we, together with the client, did marketing research, made a business strategy, defended it in front of a group of experts, and then implemented the first stage of this strategy.  At the end of the second semester, we made a presentation to the jury of experts, who ultimately gave us marks for our academic and practical results. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/6c6f0fa7/8da33f6e/73196038/8806d407.jpg"><br>  Project Group Practice of Management <br><br>  The second business project was in the framework of the dissertation project.  The business school helps in every way for the students to find real business projects or internships for their dissertation projects.  My project was sponsored by a local consulting company.  As part of the project, I conducted a study on private investment in the UK and prepared a report with the results for the client‚Äôs client.  A pleasant side effect of this project was that it was sponsored, which partially allowed me to 'beat off' the money I invested in the MBA while still a student. <br><br>  Such a practical approach allows you to test and use the knowledge gained in real conditions, which in turn helps to develop, consolidate and improve business skills. <br><br>  <b>Level of students (cohort)</b> <br><br>  The level of knowledge and experience of the students was very high, and the variety of professions was impressive.  The average age of the group was about 32 years.  In the cohort (cohort, as MBA students call themselves) there were 67 people, roughly from 26 different countries.  The youngest student was 26 years old, and the oldest was 52 years old.  Students included financiers, bankers, marketers, engineers, IT professionals and many other different professions.  Often the knowledge and experience of the students themselves helped to successfully solve educational and real business problems. <br><br>  <b>Social life</b> <br><br>  The MBA program is known for active social life, noisy parties and parties.  Sometimes I wondered how some students managed to study for a whole week, and then on Thursday, Friday and Saturday to hang out all night long.  Then come on Monday and continue to learn as if nothing had happened.  It is necessary to admit that the first 2 semesters did not keep pace with the frantic rhythm of some students.  First of all, I tried to cope with the academic load.  By the end of the second semester, learning became easier for two reasons.  First, we have become accustomed to working at a frantic pace and delivering results in a short time.  Second, the structure of the program was changed from a semester model to a modular one, when each subject was taught by modules for 5 days.  The rest of the time was allocated for independent work and preparation of written assignments. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/0ef8f48e/aa3c5de4/8dad2c05/c1b23d38.jpg"><br>  Visit to the football match Aston Villa - Tottenham <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/3de7f8fc/6af759e2/08f98166/f39236f5.jpg"><br>  Participation in the MBA Cricket League 2010 (Cambridge, Oxford, Cranfield, Manchester and Warwick business schools participated) <br><br>  <b>Importance of ratings</b> <br><br>  Already during my studies I understood the importance of MBA program ratings.  If we analyze the methods by which the programs are evaluated, we can conclude that the difference between the top business school and the middling may be insignificant.  But the main advantage of top schools is that they can attract the best students and teachers.  Accordingly, the high level of students and teachers allows us to obtain deeper knowledge and better opportunities to form business connections for a future career.  Warwick Business School has a very good rating.  To enter the top 50 business schools in the world is a very serious achievement.  But now, if I had to decide on an MBA, I would try to find additional funds to study at such top schools as LBS, Oxford or Cambridge. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/0c493255/ba03b28b/d8997668/be825cc9.jpg"><br>  Olnain Bloomberg courses <br><br>  I went through a big school this year.  I learned many things, not only academic theories, but also practical skills.  Gained invaluable experience working with people from different cultures and professions.  When I was just going to this program, I considered myself a very intelligent and savvy professional.  Thought I knew enough about business and life.  At the MBA I happened to meet a lot of smart and ambitious people.  I had to try hard not to get lost in their background and successfully complete the training.  Now I understand that I am at the very beginning of a long and thorny path.  My experience is only a small part of the amount of knowledge and skills necessary to be a successful person and a businessman. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/114865/">https://habr.com/ru/post/114865/</a></p>
