  <section class="page js-page"><h1>04 - HP T610 + Powerful Thin Client</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  In the last <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/hp/blog/175817/">issue of</a> <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/hp/">our blog,</a> we talked about the <b>HP T410 All-in-One</b> thin client.  The device, masterfully disguised as a monitor, and working from a regular Ethernet cable (in case <b>PoE</b> equipment is deployed) is an excellent solution for an accountant, sales manager or an ordinary office employee who needs not so much: a couple of office applications, a browser , client to send mail, yes the possibility of network printing. <br><br>  The needs of this category of employees are so small that to deploy an ordinary computer is an expensive pleasure, which, moreover, requires regular investments in its uninterrupted work and attention from the system administrator.  However, not everyone in the office has such modest appetites for software and hardware, and there are people who need a truly flexible and powerful solution.  This is not a reason to abandon virtualization, because they can be put on a thin client.  Is that the client will be a little thicker than usual. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/dbf/12a/4f1/dbf12a4f19f4d53896b6e10b3202c4ff.jpg">

      A good example of such a ‚Äúfat‚Äù thin client is the HP T610 +.  Its characteristics are more like an office computer than a thin client: a dual-core x86 processor, a good graphics subsystem, a wide range of ports for connecting peripherals. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  This solution allows you to connect up to four (or six, depending on the configuration) monitors, complex specific periphery via LPT or COM port, high-speed devices to the USB 3.0 bus and with all this variety of interfaces and technology practically does not become outdated: the main load, still, it is necessary on the server, and server hardware, with proper construction of the network, is easily scaled and updated centrally, and most importantly - transparent to the user. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/4d8/989/322/4d8989322ed829eb9fc08f0be6443777.jpg"><br><br>  Where can I apply such a ‚Äúthin‚Äù client?  Yes, where many.  Engineers using CAD / CAE systems, financial officers who need to output a large amount of information to several monitors, production employees whose workplace can be connected to CNC machines or other complex systems that require sufficient computing power from the ‚Äúsource‚Äù of the control signal , to process and transmit the necessary information directly to the executive modules via the COM or LPT port. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/acf/c2b/829/acfc2b8299ee92cea17266a6e103ef66.jpg"><br>  Inside, there is an AMD processor (T56N, 2 cores operating at 1.65 GHz, 1MB second-level cache, and an integrated AMD Radeon 6320 video core);  2 or 4 gigabytes of DDR3 RAM running at 1600 MHz;  one PCI-E x4 slot, (half-height, due to the size of the case);  An additional AMD FirePRO 2270 video card (2290 in a new revision) is often inserted into it, which provides the ability to connect up to four (six, in the case of AMD FirePRO 2290) monitors to one ‚Äúbox‚Äù;  and up to 16 GB flash drive, which contains the ‚Äúparent‚Äù OS needed to run and work with a virtual system.  The cooling system contains only one low-profile cooler.  In fact, the heat package of the entire ‚Äúiron‚Äù part may well be bypassed with passive cooling, but the conditions for operation are very different, and if you have +40 in the production workshop and not much less outside the window, then it is better to be safe.  In any case, the noise from this box is no more than from the office space during working hours. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/1cd/2b1/2d6/1cd2b12d693e0d812c10d0101a307813.jpg"><br>  Also, some models come with a Wi-Fi module with two antennas (both are located inside the case).  The power consumption of this solution does not exceed 85 watts, and most importantly, it supports many options for connecting to the server that manages the virtual machines, and it is available to work with Citrix, Microsoft and VMware technologies, HP RGS.  As you can see, in the list are VDI solutions, RDP options, and a specially developed protocol for working with multimedia and graphic content in a virtualized environment. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/ff4/4b2/237/ff44b22376f39029678aaab718a3e0da.jpg"><br><br><h4>  What is the advantage of such a solution over a regular desktop or laptop? </h4><br>  First, it is difficult to connect more than one external monitor to a laptop. <br><br>  Secondly, a powerful laptop will cost significantly more than a virtualized workplace, and in a few years it will become obsolete and expensive to maintain in the event of a malfunction. <br><br>  Thirdly, and the desktop, and a laptop can fail.  For the average user, this problem is almost equivalent to downtime, and it‚Äôs good if the data were regularly copied to the corporate server.  In the case of damage to a thin client, you simply take out a new ‚Äúbox‚Äù, connect its networks, enter your credentials, and work further, as if nothing has changed. <br><br>  Fourth, in the case of virtualization, the power of the desktop or laptop will be idle, and in the absence of it, we face problems from the first three points. <br><br>  And fifthly, when you need additional computing power - the server will easily provide them, and as soon as you release them - they will be distributed among other users.  This approach allows you to save on electricity, reduce equipment downtime and get additional performance when you really need it. <br><br>  <b>UPD from 22 Apr 2012:</b> We launched a special project on Habr√©, which was <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/hp/blog/175211/">described</a> in the zero post of this season.  It is located at: <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/special/hp/commercial/">habrahabr.ru/special/hp/commercial</a> and there is a lot of interesting information, the form of feedback we promised, as well as a test of knowledge in the field of virtualization.  We are waiting for you and your questions! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/177017/">https://habr.com/ru/post/177017/</a></p>
