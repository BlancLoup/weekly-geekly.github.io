      Text of the letter: <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Hello! <br><br>  I want to tell you about a new and rather unusual system in the field of P2P <br>  payments - a gift for you and for all your customers who are engaged <br>  business and not only - <a href="http://www.siteheart.com/">www.siteheart.com</a> . <br>  Funds can be transferred from one Visa card to another, regardless of <br>  in which country these cards are issued. <br>  In addition, this system allows anyone to use their billing for free. <br>  gateway (based on 3D Verified by Visa and Mastercard SecureCode) and <br>  accept for payment (either on your website, or at auction, or as <br>  payment for personal services) any (!) credit and debit cards Visa and <br>  Mastercard in any (!) Currency. <br>  All funds after the transaction are credited directly to the Visa card. <br>  seller - that is yours.  At the same time you, as a seller, receive 100% of the funds <br>  and all interest for the transaction is paid to those who pay !!! <br>  Anyone can take it either on their website or anywhere on the Internet. <br>  donations, sell something online, accepting payment cards.  They have <br>  XML and HTML API - can be integrated anywhere, including any <br>  site. <br><br>  The most important thing is that it is all free and almost anonymous. <br><br>  In addition, the system integrates into different chat rooms (besides the fact that they have <br>  have your own chat - by the way, it can be used as Live Help for anyone <br>  the site is much more convenient than ICQ) and you can take cards directly in the mode <br>  chat - that is, I communicate with someone in the chat (for example, by the buyer), I send <br>  he has a payment link, he pays for it and I immediately receive a confirmation. <br>  Links to your personal chat can be placed all over the Internet, and <br>  they show you online or not. <br>  Currently, they have developed plugins for Yahoo Messenger, Windows <br>  Live, Skype and other applications. <br><br>  I didn‚Äôt see anything like it even on the English-language Internet - believe me <br>  I saw a lot of things there.  This site, as far as I know, is designed and owned by <br>  highly respected Ukrainian PrivatBank (he also owns Privat24 and <br>  Privat -Money) - the leader of the banking sector of Ukraine, but the company <br>  registered in the USA. <br><br>  More information can be found on their website. <br>  <a href="http://www.siteheart.ru/">www.siteheart.ru</a> (not everything has been translated into Russian yet, but this <br>  temporarily) or <br>  <a href="http://www.siteheart.com/">www.siteheart.com</a> <br><br>  I hung this payment on a couple of my sites, also hung on my site <br>  friends (they thus collect donations for their organization), and <br>  also your payment links on a couple of English-speaking forums. <br><br>  People used to pay me a variety of cards - Americans, Mexicans, <br>  Israelis, Italians, and even Vietnamese, so everything works and questions <br>  no one asked me - everyone perceives the system adequately. <br><br>  On average, after a payment, the money goes to the card for two weeks - I must say that <br>  This is pretty quick for a payment gateway.  For example, in 2Checkout (the most <br>  available for us so far) at least a month you have to wait for the payment, then wait when <br>  a bank transfer or a check will come (and a check will be cashed a month or two later), <br>  Yes, all these operations must be paid for, and they accept cards of 10-15 <br>  currencies.  In the American systems, funds to a bank account are credited to <br>  the same day, but for this you need to have a merchant account in a US bank, <br>  that for non-Americans is absolutely unreal. <br><br>  And here all the currencies are accepted, and all operations are free for the merchant - ANYWHERE <br>  You will not find such a thing - I‚Äôve been through the last three years for the entire Internet - almost <br>  all normal services are only for Americans (not even for Europeans), yes <br>  and they are not free, not to mention that they need a bunch of documents <br>  show.  And then a couple of minutes to register - and go ... <br><br>  Another very important point - you know what the Verified by Visa sign on <br>  online payment system?  This is a guarantee of the VISA system itself that all <br>  merchants using this payment gateway are exempted from any <br>  consequences of possible card fraud on the part of payers <br>  there is no one will ever be able to show a claim to the merchant and how <br>  consequence of fines from banks issuing cards (amounts start at 60 <br>  bucks) <br><br>  If we talk about money transfers - then transfer from card to card <br>  it turns out cheaper than transferring money in the western union - count it yourself. <br>  Each transaction costs $ 1.75 + 3.5% of the amount (paid by those who <br>  pays - the recipient receives 100 percent of the funds, whether from P2P <br>  transactions, whether from a payment from your site). <br><br>  Knowing how difficult it is to find a payment that is free and convenient for everyone. <br>  tool (especially for our people) - I will be glad if you have this information <br>  bring to your subscribers and users - sure that many <br>  will help to quickly start a business online. <br><br>  respectfully <br><br>  Vadim vadim.gedeon@gmail.com <br></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/6811/">https://habr.com/ru/post/6811/</a></p>
