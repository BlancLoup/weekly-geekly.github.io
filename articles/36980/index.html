And, on the basis of these categories <i>(by clothes)</i> , make preliminary judgments about the requirements of the client and call him accordingly. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><blockquote>  Marketing courses often talk about the Boston matrix - ‚Äúcash cows‚Äù, ‚Äústars‚Äù, ‚Äúquestion marks‚Äù, ‚Äúdogs‚Äù (cash cow, shooting star, question mark and dog).  I have never understood <strike>how much you need to smoke in order to invent</strike> such universal names <strike>that are so</strike> inconceivable by their incomprehensibility;  "my question marks" and "dogs" are especially flawed, from my point of view. </blockquote><br>  I propose a little prodigious, but at the same time understandable classification according to the importance for the client of the above reasons (time, quality and cost).

      The term ‚Äúimportance‚Äù should be understood more broadly.  For example, in relation to the base ‚Äúcost‚Äù, the importance can be understood as the amount of funds that a client can allocate for the development of a site, i.e.  <i>for the mean cost is important</i> . <br><br>  I want to immediately note that the criteria in the framework of this classification are considered as binary, that is, the terms, for example, can be either important or not important.  It should be understood that the binary consideration significantly limits the realism of the picture, but for such a classification of the binary picture will be quite enough. <br><br>  Under each option will be given the possible characteristics of this client.  Such characteristics for each case can be a dozen. <br><br>  <i>So let's get started.</i> <br><br><h4>  1. "Insolent" </h4><ul><li>  Deadlines - Important (make the site fast) </li><li>  Quality - Important (I have high quality requirements) </li><li>  Cost - Important (I would like to save on the development of the site) </li></ul>  Let's start with the very opposite - from the point of view of the performer - the client.  The client for whom all the reasons are important.  This client has a "burning" timeline;  as a rule, he says that the site should have been developed yesterday.  In addition, the client's budget, which he allocates to the site, is relatively small.  But what is the most arrogant - with all this, it requires a high quality of the resulting work or an abundance of technical and functional capabilities;  this client is unlikely to accept the first layouts, even if you point out tight deadlines and a small budget.  With such a client is easier not to have affairs. <br><br><h4>  2. "Ready to pay quality" </h4><ul><li>  Deadlines - Important (management will deprive me of a premium if the site is not ready for the deadline) </li><li>  Quality - It does not matter (the main thing is to launch a working version of the site, make us something simple) </li><li>  Cost - Important (we are not willing to pay much) </li></ul>  The second client in question understands that in a short time and for a small budget it will not be possible to make a quality product, or a complex product.  Therefore, such a client does not impose additional requirements on quality or complexity.  Such a client, knowingly, will not torment the designer and programmer for a long time and will accept one of the first versions of the product.  Probably later he will save money and find time to finalize it. <br><br><h4>  3. ‚ÄúThe site was needed yesterday‚Äù </h4><ul><li>  Terms - Important (we needed the site yesterday) </li><li>  Quality is not important (we do not impose strict requirements on the quality of development) </li><li>  Cost - It does not matter (if you need additional funds for rapid development, we will allocate them) </li></ul>  The phrase ‚ÄúThe site should have been done yesterday‚Äù clearly describes such a client.  Exactly like the previous client, this one is also understanding.  He will pay to ensure that the site is clearly developed on time, he will worry, call three times a day, if he feels that the development is delayed.  The main goal of such a client is to complete the development on time and nothing more. <br><br><h4>  4. ‚ÄúNon-professional customer‚Äù </h4><ul><li>  Terms - It does not matter (in three months manage?) </li><li>  Quality - It does not matter (we do not impose strict requirements on the quality of development, make us something simple) </li><li>  Cost - It does not matter (if you need additional funds for rapid development, we will allocate them) </li></ul>  The client is a dream for a new website development studio.  Such a client will behave sluggishly.  He wants to develop a website, most likely, because it is fashionable or because a glass of beer told him about the sites Vasya‚Äôs friend.  Such a client is aware that the development of the site is not a cheap pleasure and has ‚Äúpawned‚Äù a good amount on the site in advance.  The only thing that fails him is that he does not understand the technical details (or does not want to understand them), and therefore does not put forward special quality requirements.  Most likely, a third-rate studio will profit from such a client, and in a year or two another client will order a new website from professionals. <br><br><h4>  5. "Fanatic" </h4><ul><li>  Deadlines - It does not matter (development will last until we come to what we consider necessary) </li><li>  Quality is important (quality is very important for us, we either hire a separate specialist who will be involved in quality control, or the whole company will approve every stroke) </li><li>  Cost - It does not matter (if additional funds are needed for high-quality development, we will allocate them without problems) </li></ul>  This client, forgetting to say hello to the customer, emotionally tells him: ‚ÄúDo us a thing!‚Äù He is only interested in the result, a result that will not be ashamed to show employees, partners and competitors.  He does not mind giving you an advance.  Such a client will wait for the result and will pay extra if you are doing everything right.  If you do not make serious mistakes, most likely, he will be your regular customer and will recommend you.  For such clients should cling, they will lead your studio to success. <br><br><h4>  6. "Charger" </h4><ul><li>  Deadlines - It does not matter (development will last until we come to what we consider necessary) </li><li>  Quality is important (quality is very important for us, we either hire a separate specialist who will be involved in quality control, or the whole company will approve every stroke) </li><li>  Cost - Important (we know that your competitor will make such a decision by 30% cheaper, but we want you to be our site, since you are doing better) </li></ul>  High quality requirements and the absence of strict requirements for the development time - this is what causes your designer to draw ten layouts on each page.  And if we take into account the mercantile spirit of this customer, it is hardly worth hoping for the success of such a project.  If you are not going on vacation, you have some leverage on the customer, perhaps you can take on the project of this client, but it‚Äôs better to avoid such risks. <br><br><h4>  7. ‚ÄúAll Inclusive‚Äù (UPD) </h4><ul><li>  Terms - Important (it is desirable to develop a website quickly) </li><li>  Quality is important (quality is very important to us) </li><li>  Cost - It does not matter (we are ready to pay for fast and high-quality development) </li></ul>  The client pays you money for fast and high-quality development.  At the same time, he expects a corresponding return from you.  Do not disappoint him, do everything as the client requires and in the stipulated time. <br><br><h4>  8. ‚ÄúEconomy‚Äù (UPD) </h4><ul><li>  Terms - It does not matter (we need to make a website in a month or two) </li><li>  Quality - It does not matter (the usual site like everyone else) </li><li>  Cost - Important (but we can not spend on its development a lot of money) </li></ul>  As a rule, on the basis of such requirements budget sites are created.  It is logical to have low requirements for the quality and timing of site development, not having a good project budget.  Such a client understands everything perfectly. <br><br><h4>  Wait, my dear, I hasten to argue to you! </h4>  <i>You probably have something to say ...</i> <br><br>  Let's discuss other names for these categories, and the very thoughts from this article: <br>  - Is it appropriate to divide customers into categories? <br>  - If you think that the classification is incomplete, add me. <br>  - Maybe in your company somehow conditionally subdivide customers?  Tell me, this is interesting. <br><br>  <b>UPD:</b> <i>Added items 7 and 8.</i> <br><br>  ¬© Yaroslav Vityazev (" <a href="http://delosite.ru/">Business Site</a> "). <br>  The address of the article in the author's blog: <a href="http://blog.vityasev.ru/2008/08/14/customer-classification/">blog.vityasev.ru/2008/08/14/customer-classification</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/36980/">https://habr.com/ru/post/36980/</a></p>
