We recommend to study them and answer the question whether you are ready for such work. <br><br>  Experts do not recommend hiring SMM as a manager for people under 20 years old, explaining this by the immaturity of young people and insufficient experience in business communications.  SMM is not just the task of ‚Äúcatching up likes‚Äù and ‚Äúunleash a group‚Äù, it is the construction of competent communication with the client, increasing brand awareness, and building loyalty. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/02e/c39/25d/02ec3925d6d26b964951e1d6070851f9.jpg" alt="image"><a name="habracut"></a>

      Creating a social network page is only a very small part of the whole work.  Correct Internet communications imply constant monitoring and posting of original messages, the development of information events and the calculation of financial costs, as well as the effectiveness of such activities. <br><br>  Not many people can afford a permanent presence in social networks.  One of the most useful functions for any social service is autoposting. <br>  Once you have set up the placement of messages (and / or) pictures that will be published in your community, as well as the frequency of publication, you can temporarily forget about maintaining your page. <br><br>  The following system makes community management much easier.  This service is very important both for large publics, in which it is necessary to constantly maintain activity, and for beginners to promote communities in order to attract new users with constant updates. <br><br>  So, what are the inconveniences that an SMM specialist faces most often? <br><br><h5>  1. Support for multiple accounts if there are many social networks and / or customers </h5><br>  Suppose you lead one group on Vkontakte, one on Facebook and another Twitter account for your company.  Keeping three tabs open during the day with these social networks is not the biggest problem.  But still, if you post the same information in all three profiles, it is better to automate this process. <br><br>  If you are an SMM specialist with experience and maintain a large number of accounts, then during the day you have to constantly ‚Äúlog in‚Äù from one account to another, enter your ‚Äútrust‚Äù groups and post posts in them, as well as respond to numerous ( hopefully) user comments.  Continuing to go from one page and go to another is very inconvenient and takes a lot of time. <br><br><h5>  2. The need to be on the network at a certain time, including non-working, so that posts leave on a schedule </h5><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/dfa/011/ece/dfa011ece87225cd3b7a4e4aa380fd97.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  In addressing these issues, the service is useful, allowing you to maintain multiple accounts at the same time and providing the functionality of cross-and deferred posting. <br>  Only a few years ago there were very few such services, and even they had one serious drawback - they did not support the most popular networks in Russia.  The reason is simple - foreign developers created them for their market, and not for ours.  Now similar services began to appear Russian counterparts.  The principle of operation is about the same for everyone.  The only difference is in how many social networks this tool supports and whether there are additional chips. <br><br><h4>  SMM metrics </h4><br>  A very important point is the definition of the success metrics of your activity.  Any action can be estimated and counted.  How effective is engaging in groups, statistics of advertising campaigns will show.  How good and useful the content is group growth.  To assess the work of a community manager will help the level of involvement in the group.  How many transitions to the site, Google Analytics or Yandex.Metrica will show with properly configured targets and marked links.  Make a list in advance of the metrics to be measured, and watch them from the very first day. <br><br><h5>  Direct and indirect social performance indicators </h5><br>  To direct we will assign: <br><ul><li>  monthly increase, which shows the number of new members of the group or new subscribers, as well as their degree of interest in the brand and content; </li><li>  involvement, which can be calculated as the percentage of users participating in the life of the page, to the total number of subscribers; </li><li>  The number of unique group visitors shows the number of group views by new users who have not previously interacted with the pages of the brand.  The higher the number, the higher the quality of engagement and the quality of the content. </li></ul><br>  By indirect usually include the number of users who came to the site from the social network.  These indicators characterize the social network as a source of attracting users to the site.  This source should be assessed by the following parameters: <br><ul><li>  the total number of users who came to the site from this channel; </li><li>  time spent on the site by such user; </li><li>  number of pages viewed; </li><li>  the duration of the visit; </li><li>  bounce rate; </li><li>  percentage of new users. </li></ul><br>  The time on the site, the number of pages viewed, the duration of the visit should not be less than the average indicators for the site. <ul><li>  The number of users who turned to you in the offline representation of the action held on the social network.  It is necessary to take into account the absolute indicators of such actions, for example, with the help of promotional codes. </li><li>  The growth of positive references on the Internet about the brand, the reduction of negative references, the overall increase in the number of references to the brand name on the Internet.  This indicator should be assessed using regular Internet monitoring and tracking absolute indicators for reporting periods. </li></ul><br>  Control measurements of all meters should be carried out once a month, preferably for the month. <br><br>  Here, perhaps, are the main recommendations for those who want to start a systematic and systematic work on social networks, but do not know where to start. <br><br>  Of course, in one article it is impossible to talk about all the nuances.  But I hope that by drawing attention to important key points, you will not make typical mistakes, and the service presented below will try to help you in your work. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/893/8bd/82e/8938bd82efe276aee5cafbc4fc867cb5.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Administrators of groups and public pages in social networks often prefer to use systems in which you can pre-specify the time of release of the post.  Marketers are familiar with various Western systems like HootSuite, which provide a free opportunity to do this, but they do not have the ability to publish VKontakte. <br><br>  The task of monitoring social networks today faces any brand.  With the help of social media you can find out the most complete information about the audience of a product or service, its opinion on the work of the company.  We bring to your attention a system that carries out such monitoring. <br><br>  This service is useful to those who promote the community in the Russian segment. <br><br><h4>  What is PRPilot.ru? </h4><br>  PRPilot.ru is a service for deferred and cross-posting on VK, Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Google+, Classmates, MoiMir. <br><br>  Postponed publications are when you plan to post in any service, set the publication time and go to rest, and the service will post these publications at the exact time you specified. <br><br>  The service is easy to use.  It makes no sense to describe the registration process, so I‚Äôll tell you more about the interface and service capabilities. <br><br>  To get started with the system, create a project, then go to the step that allows you to add social platform accounts to the service.  Enter a project name, then click the add button. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c4c/70e/8e4/c4c70e8e454632e28f4ef7641e910bb9.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  In the next step, you can add the necessary social network accounts as well as specify groups and communities for cross-hosting.  Currently available platforms for posting: VKontakte, Facebook, Twitter, Google+, Odnoklassniki, MoiMir, Instagram. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/fa5/c9c/df2/fa5c9cdf2bd39b201c1ef0455b57f8eb.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  In the status column, click on the phrase ‚ÄúNot connected‚Äù in order to go to the tab with the connection. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/312/c92/1b7/312c921b70210af024a2933f3f7f395c.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  I think that it does not make sense for you to describe the authorization process by token, since this resource has gathered sufficiently savvy users in this regard.  After all the desired sites are connected to your current project, go to the ‚ÄúRecords‚Äù section. <br><br>  In this working field you need to create a post, as well as add an image. <br>  Just below, the service‚Äôs functionality allows to shorten the link qualitatively. Next, you need to select the sites on which your post will be placed, highlighting the corresponding items. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/de2/2c1/d50/de22c1d5066ff5aee3711f8b0f49ede1.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  In addition to crossposting, you can use the service of postponed posting.  You only need to set the time and date, after which you can be sure that PRPilot will place everything strictly at the specified time in the necessary networks. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/5a5/278/43c/5a527843c93fadac52f05e21d016c412.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Users of absolutely any social platforms will post comments not in your main account, but in the blog they have entered, so it‚Äôs very important to keep track of all the sites and maintain communication on each one, otherwise there‚Äôs no sense in such a broadcast. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/fee/e60/1bb/feee601bb5b6a430ee19361b7be4bb2e.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  To simplify this task, the service has monitoring of all connected social sites in one window.  With this service, not one comment will not be overlooked by you. <br><br>  Detailed statistics and parameters of your subscribers is a useful addition to everything written above. <br><br>  The service is free, which makes it the most popular compared to similar systems providing similar services, but writing off funds. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/222681/">https://habr.com/ru/post/222681/</a></p>
