The best air cooling solution, of course, is air conditioning.  But this is not always optimal.  In an office where there are several employees, it often happens that someone is hot, and someone is blowing.  Or there is an air conditioner at home, but it is not available everywhere.  I have, for example, a study on the balcony, and split in the room.  The situation is also worsened by the fact that additionally through the windows, the sun heats the small room rather quickly.  A small compact, benchtop air cooler can come to the rescue in this situation.  I still cannot call it an air conditioner, although it is often positioned this way. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/07a/860/e0b/07a860e0b96a4890a75922867cf7ea15.jpg">

      EvaPolar comes in eco-friendly carton packs.  It is now fashionable to use just cardboard and simple monochrome illustrations. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/fdd/5b0/6d6/fdd5b06d6bd345018ee24f5017616900.jpg"><br><br>  Inside the manual, a description of the configuration and a letter from the founder of the company on the upper cardboard flap. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/4f2/69e/dba/4f269edbaa854080842c7a90029e3162.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/2b3/b84/d2c/2b3b84d2c5d8443da0f0354e864319e6.jpg"><br><br>  Under the valve is the power supply in the charging form factor for the smartphone and the micro USB cable. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/232/3a5/ce6/2323a5ce614348ad98d52443621a8a6b.jpg"><br><br>  Charging at 2A and 5B. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/a58/024/650/a5802465098a48f0b6e99c7c0203219f.jpg"><br><br>  Further, under the cardboard sealer, resembling the texture of the egg cell from the USSR, the cooler itself is in the bag, and there is a bag of silica gel at the bottom of the box. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/18b/f72/16a/18bf7216a83945f184ec0aa1c4a95a5b.jpg"><br><br>  It is noteworthy that at the bottom of the bag one more bag of silica gel was also found. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/bf8/8cd/ffa/bf88cdffaa114ad09a30551abec5837d.jpg"><br><br>  The device itself looks stylish, nothing superfluous, everything is simple. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/de8/1a7/151/de81a71510bd4ec6820439bc9a17ac3d.jpg"><br><br>  At the front there is a large air vent behind which you can see an accordion of a special filter made of basalt nanofibers.  It is this foundation that provides sufficient cooling by evaporating a large amount of water from its fibers.  This is the know-how of the company that developed EvaPolar. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/a7d/870/966/a7d870966eee4b27ab2cccc47b25d385.jpg"><br><br>  Take another look at the harmonica miracle and move on. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/7fd/5bb/8e3/7fd5bb8e3acb49b2826fb486fc4f87bb.jpg"><br><br>  On the reverse side there is a hole for the power cord and a large fan with a diameter of 120mm.  This fan makes little noise and has sufficient performance. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/33b/686/8a4/33b6868a457c40b39d767e6d6d1e0b2a.jpg"><br><br>  Below 4 rubber legs for stability and performance characteristics. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/239/8ba/82c/2398ba82c9804fd580981c0eaa4572d8.jpg"><br><br>  Top water cover, round display and rotating control ring. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/e1d/913/37a/e1d91337ae09460fb8f34cea3d857b69.jpg"><br><br>  Immediately after switching on, EvaPolar starts working, and on the screen, the switching process is accompanied by an animated snowflake.  Plus immediately lights up the blue light compartment with water. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/cd6/149/5ee/cd61495eef71435bbaafae83bad92616.jpg"><br><br>  The compartment is removable. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/538/26e/1aa/53826e1aa2564641a89224049b585ce8.jpg"><br><br>  That allows you to easily fill it with water without transferring the device entirely under the faucet. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/1d1/a0f/85e/1d1a0f85e49a4e098cebf0845f9ccb74.jpg"><br><br>  So, the water is flooded, the power cord is unwound, let's go. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/165/22c/934/16522c934846460695b21712e54603fc.jpg"><br><br>  Immediately let's check the consumption of this cooler. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/9c6/7e4/4ca/9c67e44caad44fe7b1c428b1bd2fedd7.jpg"><br><br>  With the minimum fan speed, it ‚Äúeats‚Äù 0.27A per hour. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/ee4/33c/388/ee433c38898b4f00b31ccba6c67aded6.jpg"><br><br>  And with a maximum of 1 Amp, which is provided with a standard power supply. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/865/3d1/ec9/8653d1ec9119479687d49145b277bdde.jpg"><br><br>  The display immediately shows two temperatures.  This is data from two sensors at the input and output of the device. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/15f/e29/56f/15fe2956fc1447b6b3fc499ee41ed241.jpg"><br><br>  Fan speed is controlled by turning the ring around the screen, everything is intuitive. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/9a8/a4e/af0/9a8a4eaf0eca4872bd33e9fd648694f3.jpg"><br><br>  When you click on the ring, a simple menu appears. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/6aa/4b7/e3c/6aa4b7e3c7dc468180e3e96bad195985.jpg"><br><br>  Where can I select actions at the end of the liquid in the tank, colors of the backlight, the type of degrees displayed, etc.  Everything is very simple and is accompanied by uncomplicated animation. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/3e4/bb6/9f4/3e4bb69f445a481883df4ea0ba97751d.jpg"><br><br>  For example, when the brightness of the backlight is the size of the rays, the current brightness level is selected. <br><br>  The colors of the backlight also change to any simple turn of the ring: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/f22/19c/521/f2219c521c0d48a19ad8f827f159fab8.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/4f4/8fc/aff/4f48fcaffe2a4402ace67f3edb5c3a30.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/350/7f4/a85/3507f4a8508f4c73a9a9dba00c3246e8.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/f80/c5a/3cc/f80c5a3cc6284b0ebecdeed1aabb29e0.jpg"><br><br>  Blue is certainly the most effective, but here all the markers are different in taste and color ... <br><br>  Let us turn to temperature measurements. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/b88/33d/bee/b8833dbee64b449eb56b351a34bed9e6.jpg"><br><br>  Is the air really so much cooled as the device writes? <br><br>  The most optimal, according to the manufacturer, cooling takes place in the individual zone not further than 2 meters.  I think even a little less.  For the tests, I placed the cooler in my office at the loggia. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/c37/28e/fe2/c3728efe25134780b5fb55ab32206870.jpg"><br><br>  And put two temperature and humidity sensors behind the device and in front at a distance. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/a06/5be/976/a065be976cf44ac0be6f7056ade58fb8.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/e5d/17d/c06/e5d17dc06d2948b59f8eb4a06b77bef0.jpg"><br><br>  This is the closest to the real conditions. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/1a4/923/94f/1a492394f51a443a80b411e1b0ca5874.jpg"><br><br>  According to the manufacturer, at an ambient temperature of 25 degrees and a humidity of about 60%, cooling should reach 19.7 degrees. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/42f/95e/07f/42f95e07f3fc4f7f86321199e3b92cab.JPG"><br><br>  Schedule 1 is the exit sensor from the cold side. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/fc0/72e/a74/fc072ea74c404a2ab3175fb17985bb12.JPG"><br><br>  Chart 2 is an input sensor. <br><br>  As you can see, both sensors recorded a decrease in temperature and an increase in humidity. <br>  The minimum temperature recorded during operation of the device after 4 hours was 22.1 degrees versus 24.4 at the beginning.  Humidity increased from 53 to 70 +%.  Then I turned off the cooler and went to sleep.  It can be seen as the temperature began to grow smoothly, and the humidity decreased, with the dawn the temperature jumped even higher, it was just the sun towards the windows. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/1d4/a5b/839/1d4a5b839a2a4fd7847fc8f437d35f26.jpg"><br><br>  It turns out, according to the device works.  Feels like it works even better, the air is exactly that cool.  For me, this is an ideal option for the office, where the air is always dry because of the abundance of computer equipment, and the air conditioner does not always turn on, as it blows to someone and it is cold to someone.  EvaPolar turns out that such a personal mini air conditioner, although not as effective as its big brothers, is able to cool your space a few degrees. <br><br>  Of the minuses, I found only a shortish power cord, it is still convenient for me when it is long, so that you can pull it to the outlet.  When powering from a computer, such a device should not be used to its fullest, or the port should be USB 3.0, the standard port provides only 0.5A, as I recall. <br><br>  From the pros size, weight, compactness and a pleasant appearance.  And of course, the fact that it works and cools :) Cooling methods are certainly not the most efficient, but with personal coolers, they cannot be otherwise, otherwise it is necessary to transfer heat outside the cooled zone, and this is a completely different class and size of devices . <br><br>  <a href="https://dadget.ru/katalog/zdorove/evapolar/%3Futm_referrer%3Dgeektimes.ru%26utm_source%3Dgeektimes.ru%26utm_medium%3Darticle%26utm_term%3Devapolar%26utm_content%3Devapolar%26utm_campaign%3Devapolar_807">A 10% bonus</a> applies to blog readers who wish to purchase a personalized EVAPOLAR air cooler for the GT-EVA promotional code.
