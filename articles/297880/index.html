      The basic data is presented below, the presentation of the full version of the study Social Networks in Russia, Winter 2015-2016, including the Top 20 authors and groups in social networks, is available <a href="http://br-analytics.ru/sample_report/social_network_russia_winter_2015_2016.pdf">here</a> . <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  Social networking activity </h2><br>  One of the key indicators of the ‚Äúvital activity‚Äù of a social network is the number of ‚Äútalking‚Äù users who openly express their position with public messages in social media.  There were about <strong>37 million</strong> such active authors in Russia in December 2015, they generated <strong>588 million</strong> messages per month.  Active authors who create public content make social networks a relevant indicator of public sentiment, allowing you to catch "live" social problems at the very beginning of the formation of significant trends. <br><br>  By the number of ‚Äúwriting‚Äù Russian authors, VKontakte leads <strong>- 18.8 million</strong> unique authors.  The next on the second place is Instagram - an incredible growth rate, in December this network recorded <strong>10.6 million</strong> authors, almost 5 times more than in the spring of 2015.  The third place - Twitter - the number of active authors continues to decline here, in December a little over <strong>1 million</strong> people were recorded. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/674/059/156/6740591567667bc05c6eb098feb32017.png" width="450"><br>  As for the number of messages posted daily in social networks, there are no such drastic changes.  In the first place, as before, on Vkontakte, in the second - Twitter, then - Instagram and Facebook. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/0b3/89c/4fc/0b389c4fca009239e75b09b8797f0111.png" width="450"><br><br><br>  Twitter is traditionally leading in terms of engagement, although the average number of posts has been slightly lower in the winter period - an average of 90 posts per month are generated by one active author.  Second place - LiveJournal - on average, 49 messages per author, third - Facebook - 39 messages per author.  VKontakte and Odnoklassniki are very close on this indicator - 15 and 14 messages per author, respectively. <br><br><h2>  Social media audience </h2><br>  According to TNS, the monthly audience of most social networks has declined slightly, but there are also sources that have shown growth.  So, the VKontakte audience stopped at <strong>46.6 million</strong> people, the second place went to Odnoklassniki ( <strong>31.5 million</strong> people).  The Facebook audience in December 2015 was <strong>21.7 million</strong> people, My World was closely located - <strong>16.6 million</strong> people and LiveJournal, with an audience of <strong>15.2 million</strong> people.  Instagram audience by December 2015 increased by 2 million and amounted to <strong>12.3 million</strong> people.  Twitter audience has remained virtually unchanged and is equal to <strong>7.7 million</strong> people. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/624/d00/d1f/624d00d1f95182bb3ba0cd4b1ac781f3.png" width="680"><br><br><h2>  Statistics in Russia for each social network </h2><br> <a href=""><img title="VC" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/aa8/aaa/1ff/aa8aaa1ffe2e92da92e5f6ec702ea4b7.png" width="780" height="474"></a> <br><br>  The monthly audience - <strong>46.6 million</strong> people, 40% of which - <strong>18.8</strong> million - showed public activity. <br><br>  The gender structure of the VKontakte authors is fairly stable, <strong>43.7</strong> % of the authors are male, the proportion of the weaker sex was <strong>56.3</strong> %. <br><br>  As for the age structure of VKontakte authors, we can note the growth in the number of authors 25-34 years old, their share was 32.1%, slightly higher the proportion of authors aged 18-24 years old - 32.3%, authors younger than 18 years old - 24%, older than 35 years only 11.6% of active authors. <br><br> <a href=""><img title="VK-2" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/8f8/bab/739/8f8bab739577e2ceb0dfe38a31e3d935.png" width="829" height="474"></a>  The geographical distribution of VKontakte authors is gradually redistributed towards more uniform regional penetration - St. Petersburg <strong>ranks</strong> first with a network penetration rate of <strong>31.7%</strong> , Moscow is second with <strong>23% of the</strong> registered population, then Murmansk and Kaliningrad regions and Sevastopol - <strong>19.4 %, 19.3% and 18.8% of the</strong> population activity, respectively. <br><br> <strong><a href=""><img title="insta" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/f16/d4a/4d3/f16d4a4d3d24a3405f58f9e656431da0.png" width="778" height="524"></a></strong> <br><br>  The monthly Instagram audience in November 2015 was <strong>12.3 million people</strong> , and the number of active authors was <strong>10.7 million</strong> people. <br><br>  Instagram remains the most feminine of all social networks in Russia, in the winter of 2015-16 among active authors, 77.1% are women. <br><br> <strong><a href=""><img title="insta-2" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/b3e/b23/cff/b3eb23cff6ecd57a41b88abfa0ccec55.png" width="834" height="463"></a></strong> <br><br>  The penetration rate on Instagram has not changed - Leningrad Oblast is still leading - <strong>38% of the</strong> population, Moscow - <strong>22.3% of the</strong> population and Sakhalin Oblast - <strong>17.2%.</strong> <br><br> <strong><a href=""><img title="Fb" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/4fc/8e8/a3e/4fc8e8a3ef4bd93f3b0e99677c4af4ea.png" width="778" height="525"></a></strong> <br><br>  On Facebook, the share of writing authors in the general audience continues to grow: in November 2015, the monthly audience of the network was <strong>21.7 million people</strong> , of which <strong>1.5 million people</strong> showed publication activity <strong>.</strong> <br><br>  In the age structure of Facebook, categories from 25 to 34 years old and 35-44 years old still lead - their share was 35.3% and 32.6%, respectively.  6.1% of authors are younger than 24 years old, and authors over 44 total 26.1%. <br><br>  It is worth noting that Facebook remains a unique social network in the Russian Federation, both in terms of the age structure of the authors - more than 65% of whom are between 25 and 44 years old, and in terms of public content - this is a network focused primarily on business contacts and business. <br><br>  The gender distribution of the Russian part of Facebook continues to shift towards the weaker sex ( <strong>58</strong> % of the authors). <br><br> <strong><a href=""><img title="FB-2" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/cc4/e0a/e86/cc4e0ae8698d7f31a9377044d13e19f9.png" width="826" height="462"></a></strong> <br><br>  The geographical cut demonstrates stability - most regions retain their positions: Moscow - 6.4% of the population, Altai - 3.75%, Yaroslavl Oblast - 3.2%. <br><br> <strong><a href=""><img title="OK" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/608/98b/82f/60898b82faab0a975a817232a105660d.png" width="775" height="523"></a></strong> <br><br>  Classmates, as before, remain primarily a platform for interpersonal communication.

The predominance of men among active authors is observed only on LiveJournal and Twitter. <br><br><h2>  Trends and forecasts </h2><br><ol><li>  There is a significant increase in the activity of the Russian <strong>Instagram</strong> segment.  And most of the authors of Instagram are active users of other social networks - the share of cross-posting from Instagram to other social networks exceeds 50% of messages. </li><li>  The growth of the Russian part of <strong>Facebook</strong> continues.  Moreover, this growth is observed primarily in the field of business contacts and business.  The share of Facebook in the analysis of business topics often makes up more than 30% of the total volume of social media data on a topic. </li><li>  Active growth of <strong>sites with reviews</strong> continues, both by the number of new reviews and by attendance. </li><li>  The Russian part of <strong>Twitter is</strong> slowly losing activity <strong>.</strong>  At the same time, the activity of spam bots is reduced on Twitter, but nevertheless it still accounts for more than 30% of the stream. </li></ol><br><br><h3>  Basic research terms: </h3><br>  Author is a user who has written at least 1 public message per month. <br><br>  Message - any open (public) post - in status, on the wall, in groups, comments, etc. Messages in personal correspondence or in the ‚Äúonly for friends‚Äù mode are not taken into account. <br><br>  Audience - the number of people who visited the site at least once a month. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/297880/">https://habr.com/ru/post/297880/</a></p>
