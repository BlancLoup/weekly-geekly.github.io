What is Demandware and what is it eaten with?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Hi, Habr! <br>  We continue to acquaint you with the most successful and popular e-commerce platforms.  After our previous <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/astoundcommerce/blog/231645">article,</a> we received quite a few questions about what <b>Demandware is</b> , as an e-commerce platform.  Well, let's go together and try to figure it out. <br><br>  We started developing e-commerce software at Demandware in 2004, thanks to Stefan Shambach and Wayne Whitcomb, who founded the company.  At the moment, the platform serves about 200 companies worldwide.  Of course, you can say that this figure does not amaze you, but it is worth noting that among these companies are mainly world leaders in the production of sportswear: Adidas, New Balance, Reebok;  fashion bison production: Versace, Barneys, Tommy Hilfiger, Hugo Boss;  The cosmetics industry giant L'Oreal with all its product lines, including Lancome, Vichy and many others. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Let's first consider the statistics of the use of various e-commerce platforms in the Internet space.  For this we use the data from the site builtwith.com. 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>

    <img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c89/6aa/341/c896aa34155f45a3aa3fae66bcd54781.jpg"><br>  fig.1.  TOP 10,000 commercial sites <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/521/d03/855/521d03855c2f4337a6ef65b588054df0.jpg" alt="image"><br>  fig.2.  Statistics of all commercial sites <br><br>  As can be seen from the first chart, among the 10 thousand largest online stores on Demandware websites occupy a rather large share, namely 12.02%.  But if you look at the statistics on the whole on the Internet, then it does not look so encouraging - only 0.07%.  What is the reason? <br><br>  The answer lies on the surface: the price of services for writing and maintaining the site varies in the region of 0.75 - 1.25% of the monthly sales volume of the site.  You must admit that for many companies this amount is simply unaffordable. <br><br>  It cannot be said that Demandware is an ideal e-commerce platform, it also has its advantages and disadvantages.  Consider the pros and cons of the platform. <br><br>  Probably, the main advantage of using the Demandware platform for e-commerce is that this platform does not stand still, but constantly seeks to conform to market trends.  Not the last role in this is played by the buyers themselves, who by their demands and requirements to the online store ‚Äúmove‚Äù Demandware for the better.  In other words, the marketing departments of the brands, based on their desired changes, make certain requests for improving the platform, which are based on testing and actually working on online stores.  These requests are processed by Demandware, and in turn come out in the form of releases.  Update releases are released at least 4 times a year (and in 2014, it has already been released 7), and they are applied both on new projects and on already launched ones, because thanks to the flexibility of the platform, the use of update will not break the site structure. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/95e/b80/2b4/95eb802b442a4cf3b60ddc618e352bf7.png" alt="image"><br>  rice  3. Admin Interface Demandware <br><br>  Demandware works successfully as SaaS, which for e-commerce platform is simply a huge advantage.  Thanks to a well-thought-out system architecture based on so-called balancers, the system itself is scalable.  That is, during peak loads on the site, for example, during Black friday, the system can be expanded to the required number of resources, which minimize the possibility of the site falling, and also gives the opportunity to restart production and environment without downtime. <br><br>  Also, a flexible platform design allows you to make the site exactly the way you want it to be.  One has only to look at the already launched and mega-popular sites of companies, for example, such as adidas, Crocs and the question about the design on this platform will disappear by itself. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/2d8/356/91c/2d835691cdb04996a4e76dcbef78825c.jpg" alt="image"><br>  rice  4. Crocs website <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/bc6/965/59d/bc696559de244be6b5591ad67a256e69.jpg" alt="image"><br>  rice  5. adidas website <br><br>  And let's not forget that the solution "out of the box" <a href="http://bit.ly/1sPfbZv">Demandware</a> , allows you to run the site as soon as possible.  This requires only a designer and an online marketing manager, who can only fill the site with his own goods. <br><br>  Let's now move on to the flaws of the platform.  Although there are not so many of them, we have no right to pass by them.  The first and probably the most important disadvantage of this platform is that the control of the site is almost entirely in the hands of Demandware.  Although for some customers this fact can be attributed to the advantages of the platform, because in this way it loses the problems of supporting the site. <br><br>  The second minus is pricing - payment for site support.  It is variable and depends on the success of the site directly.  Also, an additional fee is charged if the site sales exceed the volumes prescribed in the original contract. <br><br>  So, as the e-commerce platform Demandware solves all the tasks that face the online store, you only need to trust the correct team, which will deal with both writing and site support. <br><br>  We remind you that the article is an overview and if you have any questions, leave them in the comments and we will try to give you the answers. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/234983/">https://habr.com/ru/post/234983/</a></p>
