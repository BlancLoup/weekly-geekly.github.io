  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Golden Telecom bought Corbin and goes to regions with a billion dollars</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Yesterday, Golden Telecom <a href="http://www.corbina.ru/publications/news/2007/05/29/1652.html">announced</a> the completion of a deal to acquire a 51% stake in CJSC Kortek and its subsidiaries (the Corbina Telecom group of companies).  Alexander Mamut is appointed chairman of the board of directors of Corbina, he is co-owner of Corbina. <br><br>  The acquisition of Corbina Telecom is the key to the implementation of Golden Telecom's broadband strategy.  The company plans to deploy its FTTB networks in 65 major cities of Russia with a total population of about 65 million people, offering broadband and triple-play services to about 65% of all households.  The average number of apartments in a residential building is 100‚Äì120, with an average of 2.8 people per apartment.  Thus, coverage will be provided for approximately 15.6 million households or 42.3 million people. <br><br>  Within five years, Golden Telecom promises to become the largest fixed-line operator in Russia, more than Svyazinvest.  The company plans to invest from $ 1 billion to $ 1.5 billion in network development over four years.  These investments will be the largest in the history of Russian fixed-line communications. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The Corbina Telecom broadband network will be the basis for the regional expansion of Golden Telecom.  Today, this network covers about 2.6 million apartments in Moscow, St. Petersburg, Yaroslavl, Tula, Orenburg and Kaluga.  The company's network serves more than 200,000 users, providing broadband Internet access services, including approximately 90,000 subscribers connected in the first five months of 2007.

      Both companies have already <a href="http://www.habrahabr.ru/blog/lenta/10143.html">entered the market with a common product</a> .  Starting from May 1, 2007, Corbina Telecom home Internet subscribers in Moscow can use the ‚ÄúGolden WiFi‚Äù service - wireless Internet access from any place in Moscow where Golden WiFi network coverage is available.  Now the Golden WiFi network consists of about 7.5 thousand access points and covers about 800 thousand households, open spaces and the most popular public places in the city. <br><br>  ‚ÄúOur goal is to increase the speed of Internet access throughout Russia to global heights,‚Äù said Alexander Malis.  ‚ÄúMy dream is unlimited speed and unlimited Internet access throughout Russia,‚Äù said Alexander Malis, the general director of Corbina Telecom. <br><br>  Commenting on this deal, Jean-Pierre Vandromme, Chief Executive Officer of Golden Telecom, said: ‚ÄúThe acquisition will significantly speed up the deployment of our FTTB networks by combining the resources and expertise of both companies.  Corbina Telecom has already entered the group of leaders in the broadband access services market in Moscow, and Golden Telecom has managed to gain strong positions in the key regional centers of Russia.  By combining services based on VoIP, IPTV and MVN (mobile virtual network), we will be able to offer the mass user the Quadric-Play product.  These services will allow Golden Telecom to be positioned as a unique and interesting player in the telecommunications market, which completely coincides with our strategy aimed at transforming Golden Telecom as the leading fixed-line operator in Russia and the CIS. ‚Äù <br><br>  Jean-Pierre Vandromme also said that by the end of 2010 his company‚Äôs investments in the development of a fixed communications network in Russia would amount to $ 1 billion to $ 1.5 billion. Within five years, Golden Telecom will try to become the largest fixed-line operator in Russia, more than Svyazinvest.  At present, the cumulative share of Golden Telecom and Corbina Telecom in the fixed-line market in Moscow is 19%, and in Russia as a whole - 14‚Äì15%, and by 2011 it is planned to increase it to 50%. <br><br>  Expansion money will be received from the placement of Corbina, which is planned for late 2008 (the site has not yet been selected).  Mamut with partners plan to sell 25% of the company for about $ 250 million, and then they can make an additional issue. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/9128/">https://habr.com/ru/post/9128/</a></p>
