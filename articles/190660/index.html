Now the client simply runs the card on it, the application does the processing, and the phone is needed as a communication platform. <br><br>  This is the dream of many online stores - so that payment with plastic is made immediately upon delivery.  It is also more convenient to work this way from the point of view of the search for change, and in accounting, and in controlling funds from couriers. <a name="habracut"></a>

      So, the old problem was that the POS terminal is a heavy, expensive and complicated piece of design that you just can't carry around with you. <br><br>  We have developed our own solution, which consists of three parts: <br><ul><li>  Mobile phone; </li><li>  The application installed there; </li><li>  And a small connected iron terminal, stuck in the audio jack. </li></ul><br>  Everything. <br><br>  The profits are that our model turns out to be very affordable (you can give it away without thinking to hundreds of couriers, which is not the case with ordinary POS terminals), and convenient (the terminal fits in your pocket). <br><br>  The idea is not ours, the first such things were done in America by Square.  Immediately after it, PayPal Here pulled up, and the market literally exploded.  Of course, the market is very ‚Äúhot‚Äù, because banks are well aware of how important it is to give people the opportunity to pay on the spot with a card. <br><br><h4>  How does all this work? </h4><br>  First you need a phone with iOS or Android on board.  An application is placed on it.  In the audio jack is inserted the terminal card reader the size of a box of matches, which gives the phone information about the client card.  This data is transmitted by the application to the processing center, and then, after the completion of the transaction, is erased from the phone‚Äôs memory. <br><br>  The most interesting moment with a signature: without it, a transaction, as with rolling through a regular POS terminal, is considered invalid.  After, for example, the courier bills you, you see it on the screen.  Then, right on the screen, you simply sign - and that's all, the payment is made. <br><br>  For data processing, we use cloud solutions based on Amazon.  Software is fully self-written Java, php, C ++, C #.  From the point of view of the bank, the payment process via LifePay looks the same as the payment process through a regular POS terminal, which greatly simplifies integration with banking systems. <br><br>  People from Wellpay, VimpelCom, ChronoPay and Rambler participated in the development (and participate), so there is experience in proper mobile development and a good level of security. <br><br><h4>  Where can I use? </h4><br>  Given that we are not a hard piece of hardware, but a mobile application, a lot of opportunities for additional business use open up.  For example, for courier services there is a tracking of couriers (to know the place of payment), plus an analysis of the duration of trips. <br><br>  For taxi services, we are planning an auto fare calculation so that you can easily and easily calculate how much the trip cost.  For insurance companies, the eternal jamb is an error in filling out, here the application insures just perfectly well.  The second problem of insurance turned out to be even more interesting from the point of view of the project: the fact is that they usually receive money from agents in a month (they need to bring cash to the office, and then make payment to the counterparty), and if paid directly by card, this process can speed up . <br><br>  There are plans for features like this: ‚ÄúEvery fifth car wash paid for with LifePay is free.‚Äù  The business owner simply sets the rules in human form, and the application executes them. <br><br>  Judging by the western market, it is also very convenient for freelancers. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/3bd/5ee/ddf/3bd5eeddf7aa85b99ff6eaa732f2c1e5.png"><br>  <i>This is how the business owner sees it.</i>  <i>Yes, there is a bit of analytics.</i> <br><br><h4>  I want to try - what to do? </h4><br>  We provide card reader and mobile application absolutely free of charge.  The project was launched in March this year, before there was development and testing.  Now many cafes, several taxi services, courier services, car services and many online stores use our services.  Integration with CRM / ERP-systems is not there yet, but for large customers we do gateways-connectors, plus there is bulk unloading, which allows us to take raw data into our analytics systems. <br><br>  Connection takes 1 day: a contract is signed, an account is started and the necessary number of reader terminals arrives.  By the standards of the Russian banking system, it is just instant.  We have the number 8 800 555 2362 (calls to which are free), by which you can find out any questions about the connection.  Site - life-pay.ru. <br><br>  UPD, this is how the reader looks like: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/47f/bd8/a41/47fbd8a41a7f8af58d3deb093fd348c7.jpg"><br><br>  Here it is in our client‚Äôs hands: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/5bb/42e/150/5bb42e1506619bf974c1bf67fca42bb1.jpg"><br><br>  Answers to the most important questions from comments in one line: the terminal is PCI DSS certified, Cardholder Present transactions, commission 2.7%, tax registration is not required, all cards except MOMENTUM are accepted (non-revolving, without the name of the owner on the card).  In September there will be a seal to meet the requirements of the new law.  The terminal encrypts the data and sends it to the phone already closed, that is, the application simply transmits this ‚Äúblack box‚Äù with the card data. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/190660/">https://habr.com/ru/post/190660/</a></p>
