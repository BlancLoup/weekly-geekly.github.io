What can he give?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  After reading today several articles on education in universities, I wanted to express my thoughts in a post.  I do not pretend to originality, but it seems to me that some thoughts may be interesting. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  What does the university teach: </h4><br><h5>  Learns to learn </h5><br><br>  There are different teachers and different disciplines, but in fifteen minutes to pass on only one training manual - you need talent and luck.  It took me 2-3 weeks to complete the course.  Yes, he passed on triples, but from several re-take, but in the end he knew the material quite well. <br><br><h5>  Teaches to communicate </h5><br>  In the second year, I realized that to skip lectures and practices is non-commendable, which means we must look for a way out that would suit me and the teacher.  I found such a way out - to do complicated tasks (similar to a term student, but without quibbling the design).  There were really interesting assignments that I was proud to perform, and this not only brought new knowledge, but also brought communication with teachers to a new level.

      Another example of learning to communicate is Tatiana Ivanovna, a teacher of philosophy (well, if someone suddenly finds out).  At the time of the delivery of her course - she was 84!  of the year.  A man of the old age, a militant atheist who could deduct the whole group, regardless of the offerings of flowers and sweets.  At the exam, she had to explain that you were not a complete ignoramus, but it was very difficult to do this, for the vast teaching experience she knew almost all the philosophers' works by heart, and I knew one or two.  By the way, as a result, my exam was reduced to a discussion of these two philosophers. <br><br><h5>  Teaches work </h5><br>  Yes, dear reader, it is to work.  When you have several tails and you just need to take and learn / write a term paper / protect laboratory work.  ‚ÄúJust get up and do it, fuck it!‚Äù (Someone from an American film) <br><br><h4>  What the university will never teach: </h4><br><h5>  How to make a million </h5><br>  You are given the basis of knowledge, as you dispose of it - your business.  Missed something - then it is very difficult to catch up: the memory is not the same;  there is no competent person who understands the topic;  laziness;  shame (well, I personally feel ashamed when I don't know basic things). <br><br><h5>  Super modern technology in IT </h5><br>  Approval and curriculum development is not an easy job, as it seems to me because of the education system.  But technology is updated every four years. <br><br><h5>  How to become a "super-duper professional" </h5><br>  Need practice, without it knowledge is useless.  The theoretical approach to IT can be very different from the practical. <br><br>  Several abstracts from myself: <br>  - If I went to all classes at the university, I would be very ashamed not to get a red diploma, what is taught is really a basis. <br>  - It is very difficult for me to catch up with some courses, especially higher mathematics. <br>  - I worked almost from the first course of study at the institute.  Practical experience is as valuable as theoretical knowledge. <br>  - You need to learn constantly!  And not just as a student. <br>  ‚ÄúPeople without a diploma may or may not be great developers.‚Äù  The same is true for people with diplomas, certificates, awards and orders. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/183318/">https://habr.com/ru/post/183318/</a></p>
