Allegedly, within the framework of the PRISM program, nine Internet companies provided the NSA with direct access to their servers to obtain information about users: Microsoft, Yahoo, Google, Facebook, PalTalk, YouTube, Skype, AOL and Apple. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">PRISM slides</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/d1e/117/c79/d1e117c79b6cfd5b0e08579529fe0bfd.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/907/89a/da6/90789ada64cc22d81b440471242168e1.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/39b/374/da4/39b374da4a9a36f2c09731de6838f3a4.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/343/440/2da/3434402daee26a73399efa981a2ef1fb.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/4ef/c69/f9f/4efc69f9f6cd8ee1df028eb00c8035a1.jpeg"></div></div><br>  At the same time, The Guardian newspaper <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/jun/06/nsa-phone-records-verizon-court-order">posted a</a> secret court ruling <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/jun/06/nsa-phone-records-verizon-court-order">to the Internet</a> , according to which the Verizon mobile operator was obliged to provide the NSA with metadata about calls from <i>all</i> subscribers from April to July 2013, with the delivery of information on a daily basis (subscriber numbers, time and duration of calls). <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Verizon Court Order</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/ff6/c4d/546/ff6c4d546e473e66d1a079c835d498a0.png"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/dbe/5cd/84e/dbe5cd84e690d6cdf22426def3ccf277.png"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/964/339/03d/96433903df888948d62b0a8069ffe330.png"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/3d6/b70/21c/3d6b7021c72cf4bb7e75329f0eda7fb4.png"></div></div><br>  Almost all of the above-mentioned Internet companies instantly denied that they provided government organizations with "direct access" to the servers.  This led some observers to argue that the NSA could work through a private contractor - for example, the <a href="http://talkingpointsmemo.com/archives/2013/06/is_this_who_runs_prism.php">company Palantir</a> (a <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/andygreenberg/2013/06/07/startup-palantir-denies-its-prism-software-is-the-nsas-prism-surveillance-system/">refutation of Palantir</a> ).

The British Prime Minister <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-22813893">requested that an investigation be initiated into</a> the fact that the GCHQ Government Communications Center had access to personal information on citizens using the NSA's secret court inquiries procedure through FISC (Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court), as in the case of Verizon. <br><br>  US National Intelligence Director James Clapper (James R. Clapper) made an <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/08/us/intelligence-chief-calls-leaks-on-us-data-collection-reprehensible.html%3Fpagewanted%3D1">official statement</a> in which he pointed out inaccuracies in newspaper publications and called these leaks "reproducible."  Among other things, he said that the NSA did not intentionally spy on American citizens.  Apparently, the position of the special services is such that the NSA did in fact request the cellular operators for information on the calls of all subscribers, but only to filter out foreigners - and perform data mining only in relation to them, which is completely legal. <br><br>  In addition, Klapper hinted at the possibility of prosecuting journalists who published secret information, as Bradley Manning is now judging, having merged into the Wikileaks documents about war crimes of the US Army.  The ‚Äúsecret information‚Äù refers to a court order against Verizon, which the NSA recognizes as authentic. <br><br>  Interestingly, two weeks ago, the director of the NSA said that their service was <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/05/26/us-cybersecurity-nsa-alexander-idUSBRE94P06S20130526">‚Äúthe only one that does NOT follow the Americans</a> . <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/05/26/us-cybersecurity-nsa-alexander-idUSBRE94P06S20130526">‚Äù</a>  Allegedly, the NSA "does not have the technical ability to analyze the 420 billion letters that Americans generate every day, although some foreign governments are trying to do this." <br><br>  President Obama <a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2013/06/07/transcript-what-obama-said-on-nsa-controversy/">defended the NSA</a> and assured the Americans that ‚Äúno one is listening to your telephone conversations,‚Äù and all the actions of the special services are aimed at protecting the country from terrorists.  Like, a small loss of privacy - the inevitable retribution for the best security.  It‚Äôs impossible to have 100% protection and 100% privacy at the same time, the president explained. <br><br>  The scandal is rapidly gaining momentum.  The case has already entered Anonymous, who posted <a href="http://pastebin.com/MPpT7xaf">13</a> more <a href="http://pastebin.com/MPpT7xaf">documents</a> on the activity of US intelligence in 35 countries. <br><br>  Last night, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/zuck/posts/10100828955847631">Mark Zuckerberg</a> and <a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2013/06/what.html">Larry Page</a> gave official comments on the PRISM program. <br><br>  Larry Page said sharply: his statement was published under the heading ‚ÄúWhat the ...?‚Äù.  He said that he had never heard of the PRISM program until yesterday, and Google was not involved in any government programs that give the authorities direct access to the servers.  Google satisfies the requirements of the special services only within the law.  Google lawyers carefully consider each request for the release of information and often wrap it back if the request is too extensive (as is the case with Verizon).  ‚ÄúPress reports that Google provides open access to the data of its users are false, period,‚Äù Larry Page writes.  ‚ÄúUntil this week, <abbr title="In addition to Larry Page, the letter was also signed by David Drummond, Chief Legal Officer">we</abbr> have never heard of such extensive requests as Verizon received ‚Äî a request that requires recordings of calls from millions of users.  We were surprised to learn that such requests exist at all.  Any suggestion that Google disclosed information about our users' Internet activity on such a scale is a complete lie. ‚Äù <br><br>  Larry Page added that, as far as possible, Google publishes information on requests received from the state on the <a href="http://www.google.com/transparencyreport/userdatarequests/US/">Transparency Report</a> website. <br><br>  UPD.  Lead development engineer (Chief Architect) of Google, Yonatan Zunger, <a href="https://plus.google.com/u/0/%2BYonatanZunger/posts/huwQsphBron">expressed disgust</a> at the NSA's plans for mass collection of information on citizens and guaranteed that Google was not involved in this, otherwise he would not work here. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/182554/">https://habr.com/ru/post/182554/</a></p>
