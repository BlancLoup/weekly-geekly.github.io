Productive multi-core stuffing and a lot of memory, plus a dual camera.  And yet - fast charging.  Let's twist it in your hands and see what it can do. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/845/eaa/ec3/845eaaec30171307ed2c50acc249f67a.jpg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  We announced the direction of smartphones 2 years ago.  We want not just to expand the already huge smartphone market with another brand, but to make devices that can later become a key element of the smart home ecosystem, which would be built on a fast Wi-Fi network, ideally seamless. <br><br>  To introduce a maximum of people with our smartphones, we started with the release of younger models.  Neffos N1 is already strong middling.  In addition to typical smartphone chips, we equipped it with two built-in smart antennas and dual-band Wi-Fi.  And yet - we decided not to litter the device with partner applications, but installed three of our useful tools for working with wireless networks and the smart home - Kasa, Tether and Smart WLAN.  The latter, in addition to everything, allows you to use the gadget as a Wi-Fi signal amplifier.

    <h2>  What is interesting? </h2><br>  In the design, we focused on the classics and did not chase after fashionable elongated screens with bangs.  But they decided to break away from the stuffing: they equipped the device with a dual main camera with advanced matrices from Sony, added the ability to quickly charge and put everything in a nice-to-touch all-metal body.  As a bonus - the ‚Äúmagic‚Äù slider of the silent mode, which, as it seems to us, is so lacking in most Android smartphones. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/468/502/dd8/468502dd8a431cb2c9340a440db09e55.jpg"><br><h2>  What is in the box </h2><br>  Included with the phone is fast charging, in-ear headphones with a microphone, a USB Type-C cable, a clip of a SIM-card tray, instructions and a protective glass. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/08b/549/b5d/08b549b5dd2f2a3773b489a64d96d059.jpg"><br><br><h2>  Exterior </h2><br>  Externally, the N1 is rather laconic: the monolithic black front surface smoothly flows into the all-metal aluminum case of graphite color.  In size it is a typical representative of 5.5 inch smartphones, which in many situations is convenient to use with one hand - except perhaps for active surfing the net and working with applications. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ba2/bcb/cd7/ba2bcbcd7205837e3ae62af1bf26b1d6.jpg"><br><br>  The entire front part is covered with a touch glass with rounding around the perimeter.  On top of the peephole of the selfie camera, next to it are proximity sensors and ambient light brightness.  Below are three touch keys, the purpose of which you can choose at your discretion: one is more accustomed to the ‚Äúback arrow‚Äù to the left, the other to the right. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b43/1c7/969/b431c7969c675c7217b1999bb0c99998.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/19d/230/c32/19d230c32db9099b7a15527249d1449c.jpg"><br><br>  We broke the side faces with neat strips of antennas and additional controls.  By the way, the N1 has two Smart antennas with dynamic load distribution, and the Wi-Fi IEEE 802.11ac module supports 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz routers.  On the right is the power key and a combo tray for a nano SIM card and microSDXC memory card.  On the left - the volume rocker and the mechanical slider to activate the silent mode: a pleasant meditative thing with vibration feedback when activated. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/36c/7bf/480/36c7bf4802434d50cd5fa4983cf8a20f.jpg"><br><br>  An additional microphone of active noise cancellation system is on top - the main one is hidden below, behind one of the holes of the main speaker.  Also on the bottom is a USB Type-C connector and a classic 3.5 mm headphone output. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e1f/0ba/edd/e1f0baedd24e05e555798bcf2d1b06d6.jpg"><br><br>  The all-metal rear panel of the case is diluted with a strip of antenna at the bottom and a glass insert for cameras along the top edge.  On the left - the lenses of two cameras, their edges do not protrude on the surface.  Center two-tone LED flash.  Just below the flash - a massive fingerprint scanner: just at the point where the index finger is when using the device. <br><br><h2>  Display </h2><br>  We equipped Neffos N1 with a classic TFT-IPS matrix, a diagonal of 5.5 inches and a resolution of 1920x1080 pixels, in order to comfortably view any multimedia content, scroll through sites and play. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/900/475/cf5/900475cf5f4c8bdd8172c95355eb0e38.jpg"><br><br>  Visually comparing the display with the screens of other devices, it can be said that the quality of the color rendition, the coverage of the sRGB color space and the black depth are no worse here than in other models in this price range.  The brightness of the backlight, however, is not a record, but on a clear sunny day you can flip through social networks and read this material without any problems. <br><br>  The capacitive touchscreen detects up to ten simultaneous key presses, plus we added an extra sensitivity mode so that you can control your smartphone with gloves in the winter. <br><br><h2>  Hardware stuffing and speed </h2><br>  At the heart of the device SoC Helio P25 from MediaTek, manufactured on 16 nm process technology.  The MT6757CD chip includes two clusters of four Cortex-A53 cores each with 2.6 GHz and 1.6 GHz clock frequencies, respectively.  The N1 has 4 GB of RAM - a graphics accelerator Mali-T880 MP2 and 64 GB of internal storage: that is, a memory card may not be needed, freeing up space for a second SIM card. <br><br>  The device does not set speed records, but it is quite up to itself.  In all benchmarks, you can see exactly the result that you expect from the Cortex A53 cores, which are cracked up to 2.6 GHz. <br><br>  In general, the performance of this multiprocessor system is sufficient for any utilities and applications, not to mention the clients of social networks.  Editing photos and applying filters to HD movies takes less than a minute. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/647/beb/e29/647bebe291171065a4822657ec06d95e.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ea0/4e1/af7/ea04e1af73d5881661f478b9b12d9f0e.png"><br><br>  The results of measurements exactly fit into the framework of the middle class and will not worry about the brakes and slowdowns in any modern games.  We tested it on Mortal Kombat X and Real Racing 3 - this couple is well known for its high hardware requirements.  Productivity Neffos N1 here is enough in abundance, and during the game competitions only a few times managed to notice the microlags. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f93/86a/89a/f9386a89aabbae483c0928a00e37d55d.png"><br><br><h2>  Interface and features of NFUI 7.0 </h2><br>  The smartphone runs on the operating system Android 7.1.1, which is characterized by the lightness of the interface, with an emphasis on scalability.  A 5.5-inch diagonal is optimal for this OS generation, and the NFUI 7.0 shell looks only slightly different from the standard one in Android. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/73f/4db/d6c/73f4dbd6c4fad04dfe86ce0433a2c660.png"><br><br>  There is no application directory, application shortcuts are placed on the screens and can be combined with widgets.  We left the visual effects and animations in the system unchanged, but added ready-made themes and the ability to separately change the wallpaper and shortcuts of all system applications. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/247/e4b/e4b/247e4be4b0cde36b2fcbe7b5afcbe69a.png"><br><br>  All standard applications and virtual keyboard look like traditional Androids.  Notification shutter is also a classic two-part, and notifications on the lock screen can be turned off completely or partially. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ce5/643/848/ce56438484f35fa35f05b2e25a7d0d44.png"><br><br>  You will find more elements for personalizing your smartphone among the general system parameters.  In the tab of smart settings you can activate the increased sensitivity of the touch screen, reassign buttons below the screen and activate gesture control.  Nearby are security and protection options, where you can enable unlocking with a fingerprint scanner and add scans of several fingers.  The scanner works quickly, rarely makes mistakes. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/160/57c/f26/16057cf2600122665b56d2c132304869.png"><br><br>  In order not to overload the smartphone, in N1 we tried to limit ourselves to the minimum number of pre-installed utilities and applications.  In addition to the Google utility suite, we installed the classic file manager and three proprietary applications: Tether, Kasa, and Smart WLAN. <br><br>  Tether is a mobile application that allows you to manage the settings of a wireless network created on TP-Link equipment from a smartphone, control connections, change access policies from the outside: to the network itself and from within - to certain sites or the Internet as a whole. <br><br>  Kasa is an application for managing smart sockets and other TP-Link smart devices. <br><br>  ‚ÄúSmart WLAN‚Äù allows you to quickly connect to a Wi-Fi network using a QR code, generate such a password code for another device (for example, transfer network data to a friend), and also use a smartphone as a Wi-Fi repeater to enhance signal of the main access point. <br><br><h2>  Camera </h2><br>  Dual main camera of the smartphone consists of a pair of identical 12 MP Sony IMX386 flagship matrix with a grain of 1.25 microns.  One camera is main, and the second is monochrome for measuring the depth of blur, both are equipped with autofocus optics with a f / 2.0 aperture, plus an onboard two-tone LED flash. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/346/73e/152/34673e15220041a3bdb657d44b9278fc.jpg"><br><br>  The camera turns on in a second, focuses and saves the picture - even faster.  In automatic mode, it adjusts the exposure and white balance, and high-aperture optics allows you to comfortably shoot indoors and outdoors in the dark. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/776/7a6/cb9/7767a6cb9d9562569ac741368e6715c6.png"><br><br>  The second camera module is used to blur the background in a special shooting mode.  The result is neat, with an emphasis on the artistic component of the bokeh effect.  Of course, not as cool as Planar from Zeiss, but we tried to make the effect as natural as possible. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/197/e29/27d/197e2927d7366bcf4fe838005a51823e.png"><br><br>  Especially for those who like to keep everything under control, we have added a full-fledged manual mode.  Exposure, white balance in temperature in Kelvin and other parameters will significantly expand your artistic skills in mobile photography. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f89/db7/33d/f89db733dbb905b3a9697cd536f7b76b.jpg"><br>  <a href="https://yadi.sk/d/5xfdp4283YeQ37"><i>Download archive with original images</i></a> <br><br>  The front camera is equipped with 8 megapixel matrix and optics with a fixed focal length.  Here is an example taken at close range. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/cf6/a63/a5e/cf6a63a5efe365c435951cc924a59269.jpg"><br><br>  And here is an identical shot, but on the main camera.  We think that all lovers of self should be satisfied. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/dee/054/516/dee05451628d93bbb3b25c533ef1f374.jpg"><br><br><h2>  Autonomy </h2><br>  The capacity of the built-in lithium-polymer battery in the Neffos N1 is 3260 mAh, which is not so much by the standards of 5.5 inch smartphones.  In fact, it lasts a day with active use with a couple of hours of the screen on, three hours of music in headphones and 30 minutes of calls.  If you set the brightness to the maximum and plunge into the game battles, it will take 4.5 hours to charge, and with a sparing usage scenario, the device will easily last two days. <br><br>  This is the time to remind you about the fast charging of PumpExpress 3.0 from the complete storage device.  Together with him, the device is fully charged for a little over an hour, and in 30 minutes it‚Äôs already 50%.  With another charger, this process will take about two hours. <br><br><h2>  Summary </h2><br>  With the recommended retail price of 15,990 rubles, it seems to us, the Neffos N1 turned out to be one of the most balanced devices in this price range.  Good cameras, high-quality display, productive stuffing - and we hid all this in a pleasant all-metal body of small size.  By autonomy - confident middling, but this is partially offset by fast charging. <br><br>  Detailed specifications of the N1 can be found <a href="http://www.neffos.ru/product/details/N1">here</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/418297/">https://habr.com/ru/post/418297/</a></p>
