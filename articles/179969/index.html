  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Bent water!</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"> <b>Admins and moderators:</b> This branch is in the offtopic section, they write about everything here.  Though from here, do not delete the topic, there are those who want to read. <br>  Preface.  Yesterday I posted this topic in the hubs "Microblogging", "The future is here."  The people appreciated the topic, but after about an hour he moved to me in drafts marked ‚Äúdoes not match the topic of the site.‚Äù  I hope that they will not raise a hand from offtopics. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/58d/179/be1/58d179be1356e7fd574996f40428413a.jpg" alt="image"><br>  Good evening everyone! <br>  Tonight, after a hard day's work, had the inexpressible pleasure of talking with a representative selling water filters.  We had a conversation beyond good and evil, during which he opened my eyes to modern water purification technologies.  Immediately all the fatigue passed and the mood rose to heaven.  I have known Zen.  I can not keep such universal knowledge in myself, I will share with you. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  We asked our house to arrange a presentation for an advertising agent selling <s>Blue Filter</s> filters.  I learned that we have a ‚Äúbarrier‚Äù jug, asked to draw water from the tap and from the filter.  Shows a label with different values.  0-40 units - great, 200 - immediately carry people to the cemetery.  He measured the water for me and the miracle device showed 209. I understood everything and went to the store for white slippers.  When he returned, he measured the water from the filter.  The device showed 233!  I went to the store for a candle and a white sheet and started listening to Master. <br>  - See what results from the filter? <br>  - I see. <br>  - Surprised? <br>  (here housewives usually wave their heads in an affirmative manner) <br>  - Not. <br>  - Why is this?  (surprised) <br>  - Well, I actually imagine a coal filter device and understand perfectly well that at the exit some of the impurities were removed, but the filter gives up some of its particles into the water.  Therefore, water conducts current even better. <br>  - Nah, you don't understand anything at all!  This is because the filter first, during the week, takes in bad substances, and then vigorously gives.  And you get double dirty water from the filter.  Therefore, the cartridges in the filter should be changed once a week.  And since  they cost about 300 rubles, then a month you have to give 1.5 tr. <br>  - The traffic police post is not far from here, so be careful! <br>  - In terms of? <br>  - In the sense you persecute, and strongly. <br>  - IN TERMS OF??? <br>  - The cassette in a family of two people should be changed every 2-3 months, depending on water consumption.  It is even written in the instructions of the manufacturer. <br>  - The producer does not know a fig.  Our company knows them better in the process. <br>  Here I am slightly hung from such statements.  Well, okay, let's continue, the conversation is scheduled not boring.  I take out a new cartridge from the box, insert it into the filter and pour water through it.  This comrade got nervous, no one seemed to be doing experiments with him, it is his prerogative.  Measured the water after the new cartridge - 215!  No wonder, I spoke coal particles.  But I said nothing, looking with honest eyes at him.  Here he hung.  For a long time. <br>  - Nuuuu, tuuut etaaa.  In short, you bought a fake filter, you had to take the cartridge from the manufacturer, not a fake.  Fi! <br>  I said nothing.  When an intelligent man argues with a fool, then from the side it‚Äôs impossible to tell which of the two is a fool. <br><br>  It is time tricks.  He takes out a bottle of his water and a box with a wire and two sets of electrodes.  The wire is plugged into the outlet, the electrodes are lowered into my water samples.  The standard electrolysis process begins, accompanied by bubbles, boiling and the formation of rusty deposits from its electrode. <br>  - See? <br>  - I see! <br>  And now my water from the filter. <br>  Electrodes are lowered into the water and nothing.  And why be surprised, distilled water is an extremely bad conductor. <br>  - See? <br>  - I see! <br>  - Do you understand now what water to drink? <br>  - Yeah.  From the tap. <br>  - WHY IS THIS??? <br>  - You go to the forest, drink distilled water.  Immediately wash all salts from the body and bones.  Whether the heart will fail, or osteoporosis with fragile and soft bones dodelaet. <br>  - No, we do not have such water! <br>  (but I see with my own eyes that such) <br>  - We have a system of 7 steps of cleaning.  The first 3 are coal and some kind of thread (I don‚Äôt remember already).  4th filter - membrane.  From it, distilled water enters the remineralizing filter. <br>  - Stand!  I told you about the cops.  Again you persecute not childly. <br>  - Yes, what is wrong is wrong? <br>  - taught physics? <br>  - taught. <br>  - What the hell is distillation in the filter at room temperature and normal atmospheric pressure? <br>  - Well, there is this ... (again hung).  Oh, there is no distillation, there is osmosis.  Back! <br>  - Well, now it's another matter.  I readily believe in it.  State further! <br>  ‚ÄúThis purified water goes into the remineralizing filter.‚Äù  And from it to the filter of coconut chips.  There, water restores its structure.  (followed by a gesture when the clenched fist is unclenched) <br>  - And you can find out what happens with the structure of water in the mechanical filter? <br>  - Well, it comes out of the <b><i>membrane.</i></b> <br>  When I got up from the floor, raised my fallen jaw from there, we continued. <br>  - WHAT WATER ???? <br>  - Bent, crumpled. <br>  - WATER?  COGNATED?  BOUGHTED? <br>  - Well, yes, the water molecule is korezhitsya in the membrane. <br>  - Molecule?  Is it correct?  In the membrane?  What exactly?  Electrons break away, free ions are formed, the atom breaks down into protons and neutrons, which in turn decompose into quarks?  And then everything is going back to the coconut filter? <br>  - Well, yes, sort of.  You know, the time is already late, I have to go.  Here is a website for you, read there more.  Goodbye!

      For those who have bad physics, I will show in the pictures the principle of the filter. <br>  Water to filter: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/fa1/e75/982/fa1e759825e01eb08590cc4e3a17c7c3.png" alt="image"><br>  Water after membrane: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/c65/426/49a/c6542649afca961eda07553c642de30e.jpg" alt="image"><br>  And the water after the coconut filter <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/fa1/e75/982/fa1e759825e01eb08590cc4e3a17c7c3.png" alt="image"><br><br>  I don‚Äôt understand one thing, why so much money was spent on the hadron collider?  You buy this filter, remove the last 3 steps and for 10-15 thousand rubles you have the same result. <br><br>  Then he remembered another similar story, add here. <br>  I once talked with one seller of the high tech tech science nonsense.  He was selling rubles for a 500 centi-centimeter Schumannite record.  The conversation was like this. <br>  - What kind of garbage? <br>  - This is megakmen, which protects a person from the radio radiation of the phone. <br>  - Cool!  How to use it?  (I'm already starting to look forward, as much as saliva flowed) <br>  - It is applied to the back of the phone under the cover film.  True cover will have to change. <br>  - Class!  So is he blocking the phone's radio?  Completely? <br>  - Of course completely!  This is a shumanit!  Because so much is worth. <br>  - To go nuts!  Stop!  If the phone is blocked from the back, and I attach it to the front, then the radiation is not blocked?  (5 minutes studying shades of spots on his face).  Trying to "help": <br>  - can it be necessary to shove it into the front cover?  (he feels the end of the rescue rope, grabs it. Only it was not the rope. And I could not interrupt this nonsense anymore). <br>  - Yes, exactly, I was wrong.  Need to front! <br>  - Well.  Only he dials the number then closes.  We take out the phone from the case, dial the number and shove it back?  Talked, pulled, put the phone and again in the case? <br>  - Mmmm.  Yes, some sort of garbage comes out ... Oh, no, I remembered!  HE RADIO WAVES !!!  (on this phrase the sky did not fall on me. but the cracks obviously went. Well, to hell with it, a gravity concentrate of such power that attracts radio waves. Okay, we are fools, we will play more) <br>  - Well, that's another thing!  This is a good thing, we must take.  Stand still  But what if he blocks the radio waves, then the phone will not work?  Does he block them? <br>  - Blocks, but only harmful.  A useful skips.  (MOM, GIVE ME BACK !!!) <br>  - Well, we blocked the phone.  But do they connect with the telephone tower?  Their radiation is 10 times stronger and around us there are now radio emissions of 20 nearest base stations (smarts, megaphone, mts, beeline. About radio, television, satellites, gps, relays, radars, I‚Äôm not talking). <br>  He pulls out his phone, pulls the same disc out of its case, looks at it thoughtfully. <br>  - AND THE FUCKING IS THE SAME I HAVE BEGAN FOR 300 RUBLES I BOUGHT? <br>  Then I could not continue the conversation, because  stood on his feet and breathed with difficulty. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/179969/">https://habr.com/ru/post/179969/</a></p>
