I did it then on a modem connection and through the desktop application, I don‚Äôt remember which one.  I usually put it on all night (3000 letters with attached pictures of goods were sent out for about 6 hours).  The next day, it was already possible to observe 150-300 visitors on the site and 10-15 orders.  It was a great result for that time. <br><br>  Is it real today?  How to make an effective newsletter and do not force yourself to hate?  This and other questions will be answered from 10 to 13 October at the first in Russia training conference on email marketing ( <a href="http://mailconf.ru/">http://mailconf.ru</a> ) <b>on board the ferry Princess Anastasia on the route St. Petersburg - Tallinn - Stockholm - St. Petersburg</b> <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>

      In the US and Europe, email marketing is one of the most favorite tools of marketers.  It's so easy to inform all customers, partners, employees and others about what is happening in your company with one button.  They allocate budgets for it (sometimes considerable ones), hire specialists, attend seminars, etc. <br><br>  And what happens to the e-mailing opportunities now in Russia?  Who among us attaches to newsletters today in the formation of site traffic and sales from it?  And what can we say about user loyalty and repeat sales? <br><br>  In general, the situation is not simple, but the first step to correct it has already been taken: together with our partners, we (the <a href="http://www.unisender.com/ru/">Unisender</a> company) organized the first practical conference on this topic.  We had to collect literally ‚Äúbits and pieces‚Äù of those who have been working with mailings for more than a year and know literally everything about them - from technical details to new revolutionary ideas.  Invite foreign experts and collect speakers on related topics.  And we succeeded. <br><br>  Today we are ready to invite everyone to learn how to work with civilized (that is, not spamming) mailings in a unique place - aboard a sea cruise liner that sails from St. Petersburg on October 10.  During the voyage to Stockholm and back, there will be an intense work program. <br><br>  The work program includes seminars, master classes and consultations, a little reminiscent of the ‚Äúboring‚Äù and promotional reports of other conferences ( <a href="http://mailconf.ru/program">you can familiarize yourself with the program here</a> ).  This is a source of new knowledge and opportunities for those who want a real result. <br><br>  First of all - this is the experience of leading European experts - the author of the blog <a href="http://www.b2bemailmarketing.com/">BeRelevant</a> will conduct trainings at the conference <a href="http://www.b2bemailmarketing.com/">!</a>  and the founder of the <a href="http://www.emailmarketersclub.com/">international email marketing community</a> , Tamara Gielen (Belgium), as well as her colleague from <a href="http://plantoengage.com/">Plan to Engage</a> , Kath Pay (United Kingdom). <br><br>  Russian experts and representatives of large Internet companies will also share their experience. <br><br>  For example, about what new opportunities are opening up for those who are doing the distribution (legal), the project manager of the Mail.ru Mail - Sergei Martynov will tell us (note the author - to be honest, I myself am wondering - what exactly will be discussed). <br><br>  Or, Olga Pavlova, the head of UsabilityLab St. Petersburg office, will share the usability secrets of letters in mailings - also an absolutely unique material. <br><br>  The cost of participation in the four-day program (16,000 rubles) already includes accommodation on board in a 4-berth cabin, participation in all activities of the work program and coffee breaks.  Additionally, you can purchase a 2-bedded accommodation or full meals on board ( <a href="http://mailconf.ru/prices">here is available a full price list</a> ). <br><br>  <b>Presentation of the conference from <a href="http://usabilitylab.ru/">UsabilityLab</a> (Dmitry Satin speaks):</b> <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/3l49ZXINJdw%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,1500003,15700022,15700186,15700191,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhicWTpSE0mH3pMDcVJeHDVVbV4YFA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  <b>Now about the pleasant:</b> <br><ol><li>  <b>10% discount</b> for participation in the promotional code "UNISENDER_HABR" when <a href="http://mailconf.ru/users/new">registering</a> on the site <br><br></li><li>  For the first time in Russia - <b>MONEYBACK</b> .  We will refund money if you can‚Äôt increase your sales by the participation amount in a month.  Read more - <a href="http://mailconf.ru/pages/10">here</a> . <br><br></li><li>  Recommend your colleagues (chief, for example) or friends to attend this conference and <strike>you will be happy to</strike> <b>receive a bonus</b> - a 70% discount on conference audio materials.  Promotional code for colleagues - "HABR_yourlogin". </li></ol><br>  Well, the <b>MOST IMPORTANT: a</b> tense program will be diluted with a pleasant rest, tasty food and good pastime.  The ferry will have all the possibilities for this - a nightclub, bars, restaurants, aqua-zone, DutyFree shop and many other features. <br><br>  <b>Who is with us on board?</b>  <b><a href="http://mailconf.ru/users/new">Register here</a> .</b> <br><br>  PS Please note that to participate in the conference you need a valid passport and a Schengen visa.  We can provide an official invitation to the conference and send it to the Estonian consulate.  If necessary, we can help speed up the issuance of a visa, but expect that it takes about a week to get a visa. <br><br>  PPS <b>Where is the competition?</b> <br><br>  We are looking for a person who could broadcast the conference on social networks, upload photos and make a report on the results of the conference (and also actively help us with the promotion of the next event). <br><br>  Therefore, we announce the competition by the end of this week for the selection of the best challenger.  Recommend us an active person in the community (or outside of it) that you consider worthy of being in this role (with a personal recommendation and a description of the candidate‚Äôs opportunities to promote the conference and the next event). <br><br>  We will consider all candidates and announce the best challenger, according to the jury, on Friday before lunch.  Your suggestions can be left in the comments.  By the way, you can recommend yourself :) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/128525/">https://habr.com/ru/post/128525/</a></p>
