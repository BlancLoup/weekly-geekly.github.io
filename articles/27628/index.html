  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Bureaucratic usability</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  There is such a site - <a href="http://www.zakupki.gov.ru/">zakupki.gov.ru</a> .  This is a portal where all state purchasers of federal subordination (universities, factories, etc.) are required to post information about the ongoing competitions. <br>  Unfortunately, I have worked with this resource.  I will say it was painful.  It‚Äôs hard to even browse the site: ‚Äúyour request has been queued, load the page in 5 minutes‚Äù - such phrases are the norm for zakupki.gov.ru.  Not to mention the fact that from time to time he lies.  At the same time, organizations are obliged to post information about the competition that has begun or the request for quotations, and within a short time.  If I remember correctly, then the contest must be reported within 3 days, and the request for quotations within 1 day.  I don‚Äôt even want to talk about the convenience of posting information about the contest, everything is so confusing. <br>  I have not been working with this resource for a long time, but I remained subscribed to the news of the service.  Yesterday I will receive a letter from zakupki.gov.ru that touched me for living. <br>  I will quote in part: <br>  <em>From June 16, 2008, an updated version of the official website of the Russian Federation on the Internet will come into effect for posting information on placing orders <a href="http://www.zakupki.gov.ru/">www.zakupki.gov.ru</a></em> <br><br>  Well, finally, the new version will be more convenient, people will suffer less, I was delighted at first.  But as it turned out early. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  ‚Äú <em>In order to post information on placing orders on an updated website, ALL organizations - state and municipal customers need to undergo a RE-REGISTRATION.</em>  "

      Do you imagine that MyKrug or Odnoklassniki launch a new version of the site and offer all users to register again?  Me not.  But officials can easily imagine. <br><br>  ‚Äú <em>The re-registration procedure, as experience shows, is extremely complex from a technical point of view and requires significant efforts and time-consuming.</em>  " <br><br>  Honest, immediately warned.  But for this and was released a new version of the site, is not it?  To make life easier for users.  No matter how wrong! <br><br>  <em>‚ÄúGiven this, we suggest you use our services and reassign the re-registration to our specialists.</em>  <em>...</em> <em><br></em>  <em>... The cost of the service is 4,600 rubles, not subject to VAT. ‚Äù</em> <br><br>  I'm shocked.  Instead of making the functionality of the portal more convenient, these people force everyone to re-register on a mandatory basis, they themselves say that it is not easy to register and ask for money for help.  Make kaku, and then take money from users for what they themselves have made uncomfortable. <br>  Of course, I understand that registration on the public procurement portal cannot be as simple as on a social network.  But not to the same extent complicate things.  Or is it so dense in government institutions? <br><br>  PS  How many regional and federal sites of various committees, departments and other official sites looked, it seems that for 90% of them the design was drawn by system administrators. <br><br>  UPD.  The site has information: <br>  <em>In connection with the reports of state customers about receiving offers of paid assistance in re-registering an organization, the Ministry of Economic Development of the Russian Federation reports.</em>  <em>The information contained in these proposals about the possible acceleration of re-registration of the organization, close cooperation with the Support Service of the official website and the Ministry of Economic Development of Russia is unreliable.</em>  <em>Re-registration of organizations on the official website is carried out in the prescribed manner.</em> <br>  So the fee for this is still not taken.  The letter was disguised spam. <br>  But, try to find the contact details of the support service of the site - phone or e-mail.  I did not find outright, except in the news, which will soon leave the main page. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/27628/">https://habr.com/ru/post/27628/</a></p>
