  <section class="page js-page"><h1>IMHO about projects with Startup Weekend</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Was today at the opening of the <a href="http://moscow.startupweekend.org/organizers">Moscow Startup Weekend</a> .  What can I say: an amazing amount of enthusiastic people, about 60 presentations.  Even for two minutes each resulted in two hours. <br>  Topic, mainly for those who were not. <br><br>  Most, in my opinion, interesting ideas-projects in the order added to the site SW <br><blockquote>  5. Stream.FM - monitoring regional radio <br>  PotokFM is a hardware and software solution for monitoring. Broadcasting of all FM radio stations in the largest cities of the country. <br>  Basic features: <br>  a) Automatically monitor discrepancies on the air of one radio station in each region for compliance with the official regional grid.  Consumers radio station owners, program and regional directors.  As well as state structures. <br>  b) Search for sound patterns (commercials, musical compositions) to analyze the statistics of rotations.  Consumers are large advertisers, advertising agencies, and rightholders of all stripes. <br>  Lyrics: I propose to work with the radio as a media space that can be recorded and stored, which can be freely searched for, which can be studied and analyzed. <br>  <a href="http://potok.fm/">potok.fm</a> </blockquote><br>  A good example of a useful and well-monetized idea: radio stations need a project, musicians do the same, and listeners will not be left behind.  True, the project can hardly be called a startup, there are competitors, but the value is that the idea is already working and making money. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><blockquote>  6. Starmaker.ru <br>  This is a UGC project (User Generated Content), in which content is created by novice performers.  The project was created on the model of Fan funded music.  Upon reaching one of the three possible goals (in the terminology of the project, they are called successes) - 70 000 rub., 300 000 rub., Or 500 000 rub. <br>  The artist records a song, makes a video or releases an album, respectively.  All work on the production of audio-visual works with the Artist lead professional producers and production companies. <br>  <a href="http://starmaker.ru/">starmaker.ru</a> </blockquote><br>  Immediately sent sms familiar singer :).  After all, a great thing - to make a platform so that fans can directly invest in a good performer.  Nafig these muddy production centers, nafig strange rotation system, nafig ‚ÄúGolden Gramophone‚Äù ...

    <blockquote>  15. Idea Manager <br>  Idea Manager allows you to solve operational and strategic tasks of the company with the help of knowledge and ideas of the maximum number of employees. <br>  Company management formulates tasks, and employees offer their ideas for solving them.  Ideas are collectively discussed and evaluated, resulting in a list of ideas, in the success of which the majority of employees are confident.  One person may be wrong, all - no. <br>  <a href="http://idea-manager.ru/">idea-manager.ru</a> </blockquote><br>  Quite a good idea for a niche service.  Conveniently, the offers are anonymous, the ability to disable departments is convenient.  The question is only in the strength of the leadership :) <br><br><blockquote>  20. The system of scheduling classes for universities and schools <br>  The scheduling system is a SaaS solution that allows you to simplify the work of the scheduling department at times.  The system is filled with all information about the university, on the basis of which the compilers of the schedule are given intelligent prompts, which allows you to avoid mistakes. <br>  The system will also help universities that do not have a centralized scheduling department. <br>  Also, deans, students and teachers can view their schedule and agree on controversial audiences within the system. </blockquote><br>  All the way the guys said: the schedule on a piece of paper, you have to go to the university, all things.  About the school schedule I am silent already!  What is missing is a mobile application and integration with the mobile scheduler. <br><br><blockquote>  25. Mobile application ‚ÄúShopping List‚Äù <br>  Mobile site / application for making a shopping list, sorting them by department, and the order of departments depending on the store.  This application is necessary for everyone who goes to the store to save time.  When you need to buy something in a store, you can either keep everything in mind (most likely something will be forgotten), or sketch a list on a piece of paper, which means it will be unstructured and you will have to run 100 times from one end of the store to the other to buy ALL.  My solution allows you to structure purchases by department (which means we go into one department and immediately take everything), and departments depending on the store (which means the customer‚Äôs path is direct, and does not resemble Habr logos). <br>  <a href="http://list.intruder.ru/">list.intruder.ru</a> </blockquote><br>  The people on Twitter wrote that "everything is already done before us."  But, for example, I like the idea, but I don‚Äôt see something big ... Although the chip ‚Äúthe wife from the house corrected the list, the husband saw it in the mobile phone store‚Äù - a class. <br>  Integration with food delivery stores and food accounting projects would be useful (I‚Äôm not writing about it here, because implementation without the participation of a smart refrigerator is almost unreal) <br><br><blockquote>  28. And from our window <br>  ‚ÄúAnd from our window‚Äù is an informational project, the task of which is to take care of tenants of apartments in Moscow and protect their interests. <br>  Every day we select the three best apartments that are currently being rented in the central districts of Moscow - odnushku up to 30 thousand rubles, one-bedroom - up to 40 and three rubles - up to 50. We call up all the ads before publication, so the site does not have "dummy" and zamanuh. <br>  <a href="http://aiznashegookna.ru/">aiznashegookna.ru</a> </blockquote><br>  Who rented an apartment, can only welcome the convenient service.  The main question to the authors of the project: how to deal with the fact that good apartments do not even live up to the morning?  In the evening, ads on cian hung, in the morning the apartment was already rented. <br><br><blockquote>  39. On-line designer clothes designer <br>  The opportunity for every girl / woman, without possessing special design knowledge and skills, to create their own clothes.  Choose the shape of the future product, the type and color of the fabric, accessories.  And to get the finished model embodied in reality with home delivery in 2-3 weeks. </blockquote><br>  The thought is fresh and interesting.  The problem, however, as always, in the Post of Russia :) <br><br><blockquote>  50. PlanMyTrip <br>  PlanMyTrip - A service that offers you interesting, bright and original ideas for your trip. <br>  The service helps travelers who prefer individual tours to decide on a tour and buy at a lower cost than in a travel agency. <br>  <a href="http://www.plan-my-trip.ru/">www.plan-my-trip.ru</a> </blockquote><br>  The main thing is that you can generate and upload your individual route and your individual audio guide to your smartphone.  No questions, I'm willing to pay for it. <br><br><blockquote>  54. IT_Rastilka <br>  The system of indicators of professional development of knowledge and skills of an IT specialist with elements of a social network. <br>  The project solves the problem of quantitative assessment of the knowledge, skills and experience of a specialist (in the aggregate and by sections).  The result of the assessment are the points confirmed by experience, profile tests, visits to thematic events, recommendations. </blockquote><br>  Do I need another IQ - a moot point.  Again, I advised the authors of a startup to look at the ‚ÄúProgrammer Matrix‚Äù. <br>  But personally, I would adequately assess my weak points and get a recommendation for their elimination would not hurt. <br><br><blockquote>  55. Efficient taxi <br>  Idea: Creating a unified taxi service.  Mobile applications for the client, driver and web service for searching and ordering the best option that best suits the client in terms of price, quality and delivery time. </blockquote><br>  These are not taxi companies inefficient, but taxi drivers are dazed :).  The idea to integrate everything at once is very good: so that I can see on the mobile phone exactly where my taxi is going ... <br><br><blockquote>  58. Park easily <br>  Convenient search for the nearest parking places.  An important goal of the project is to partially solve the problem of traffic jams, which, as we know, are also formed due to improperly parked cars.  There are no analogues in Russia. </blockquote><br>  The idea is awesome, users will find immediately.  The problem is a small number of parking spaces in Moscow in principle: ( <br><br>  <b>The most disastrous, in my subjective opinion, projects:</b> <br><blockquote>  9. MyRest.Ru - social network about rest in various institutions and music performers <br>  Thanks to the qualitative analysis of all existing institutions and their sites, as well as the interests of users, it was revealed that people are interested in visiting each type of institution separately and what sections they may have or what information people want to get before going to this type of institution or, what people would like to know about their favorite music artists.  After that, a system was developed that satisfies the needs of people, as well as the needs of customers who could interact with visitors to their establishments or fans. <br>  All created information by all institutions and music performers except their sites is also displayed on the main project site and all output content is divided into various sections and subsections, thanks to which any person can easily and quickly find the necessary detailed information on the right request, due to the fact that all created by the client is entered into strictly defined headings and subheadings. <br>  <a href="http://www.myrest.ru/">www.myrest.ru</a> </blockquote><br>  Another SS about anything.  All this is already in others, why make a fuss? <br><br><blockquote> 12. Social network for leisure planning <br>  The idea is to create a social network in which users can group together in related communities to form and discuss their leisure time.  Connected groups (communities) will be created based on interests, events and places of users, and will allow you to conveniently and efficiently plan leisure. </blockquote><br>  Similar to the previous speaker. <br><br><blockquote>  23. ‚ÄúLifeSport‚Äù website <br>  The project ‚ÄúLifeSport‚Äù is designed to unite people with common interests in various sports areas. <br>  The main audience - people involved in sports, sports organizations and their representatives. <br>  The project ‚ÄúLifeSport‚Äù provides an opportunity to centrally learn various sports, watching master classes, reading articles, attending trainings.  Participate in sports communities and fan clubs, learn interesting things about your favorite team, share useful materials while having the opportunity to earn money and simply communicate with interesting people. </blockquote><br>  With a virtual instructor, you can be called so that later you will need a very real doctor ... <br><br><blockquote>  24. About classical music <br>  Resource that unites performers of classical music, giving the following possibilities: exchange audio and video recordings of your own performances (both concert and specially recorded);  announce upcoming concerts;  conduct classes and master classes;  create a portfolio page;  composers - to submit their works. <br>  The project aims to solve the problem of the lack of a full-fledged web2.0 portal for connoisseurs, performers and composers of classical music, as well as the popularization of classical music and cultural development of young people. </blockquote><br>  Again, why? <br><br><blockquote>  27. TukiTuki <br>  The essence of the idea: to create an Internet service for an anonymous (but moderated) delivery of an e-mail or appeal to an e-mail box, through a social network (VKONTAKTE, CLASSMARKS, TWITTER, etc.), via MB.  communication in the form of SMS, etc. <br>  <a href="http://tukituki.ru/">tukituki.ru</a> </blockquote><br>  About 10 years ago jokes with sending a letter to a friend allegedly from the ‚ÄúPresident‚Äù were popular.  Since then, the standard of mail has not changed; what is new in the draft is unclear ... <br><br><blockquote>  42. Shablonarium <br>  The essence of the idea lies in the automatic substitution of user data (for example, name) in the forms of documents (for example, an application for leave), including the preparation of contracts for legal entities. <br>  <a href="http://shablonarium.ru/">shablonarium.ru</a> </blockquote><br>  <a href="http://formz.ru/">formz.ru</a> and its competitors have already deprived the project of a chance to live: good resources are needed to keep the base up to date, and where do they get the startup? <br><br><blockquote>  52. SimplyLook.ru <br>  A variation on the topic of recommendation services. <br>  On the example of videos. <br>  (The idea can be interpreted to other types of content) <br>  Everything is done by pressing one key (you can enter or -&gt;). <br>  Videos are shown to the user, to move to the next clip, press a key.  The time of viewing each video by each user is fixed.  Based on the accumulated data on views by previous users, videos start to be selected in accordance with the preferences of users who have responded in a similar way. <br>  This way you can get closer to the fact that users will be given content that they want to see. <br>  simplylook.ru </blockquote><br>  The main question is how to make the user watch this content?  Looked at five different clips, not one liked, left.  And more - did not come! <br><br><blockquote>  56. CookDoc <br>  Creating an API to access documentation from the IDE.  The project is intended for programmers. </blockquote><br>  Most IDEs already have this!  Tooltips, the transition to the documentation on the function, help on syntax ... Why, then, put something else that can be crookedly integrated into a specific IDE. <br>  As an option, if similar pieces of code were searched for in the base of the OpenSource projects and offered to help, that would be cool and interesting.  And the help - why? </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/109340/">https://habr.com/ru/post/109340/</a></p>
