  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Podcasting in America attracts advertisers</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Millions of American users regularly download audio and video podcasts.  As the audience grows to podcasts, advertisers gradually begin to look closely. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The latest statistics from Nielsen // NetRatings ( <a href="http://www.nielsen-netratings.com/pr/pr_060712.pdf">PDF</a> ) shows that podcasting in the US is rapidly gaining momentum.  Approximately 6.6% of the total number of Internet users (this corresponds to 9.2 million people) say that they have downloaded at least one audio podcast in the last 30 days.  Video podcasting is also gaining momentum: its audience is 4% of users, or about 5.6 million people. <br><br>  At first glance it seems that the popularity of podcasts is not very high: what is six and a half percent?  But actually it is quite a big number.  For comparison, one can cite the number of those who blog on the Internet: there are only 4.8%, that is, one and a half times less than audiopod audiences.  But blogs have appeared on the Internet much earlier than podcasts. <br><br>  Podcasting is a relatively new technology of audio and video broadcasting via the Internet, in which files are recorded for listening on iPods or other MP3 players.  It is assumed that the podcast files are downloaded from the Internet and are recorded into the player automatically when it lies quietly on recharging, connected to the computer.  Every morning, a person wakes up, takes his player (or a mobile phone with a built-in player) and listens to new programs that have been recorded there - this is called podcasting.  In principle, you can download files manually and listen to them, for example, on a computer.  But then it will not be podcasting.

      American polls have shown that the main audience of podcasters is youth.  This is not surprising, because, according to statistics, it is young people, mostly male, who are always learning new technologies.  Users aged <nobr>18-24 are</nobr> 1.72 times more likely to listen to podcasts than regular middle-aged users.  Interestingly, with video podcasts, the statistics are slightly different.  More active than others, users <nobr>aged 25-34</nobr> download and view video files from the Internet. <br><br>  Apparently, the most favorite player of American podcasters is the Apple iPod.  At least, the statistics of browser popularity hints at it quite clearly: Apple Safari is in the first place with a large margin, Firefox is in the second place. <br><br>  Quite interesting statistics of the most popular content sites among fans of audio and video podcasts.  For the former, it is <a href="http://www.macworld.com/">Macworld</a> , <a href="http://www.wired.com/">Wired News</a> and <a href="http://slashdot.org/">Slashdot</a> , and for the latter, it is <a href="http://startrek.com/">StarTrek.com</a> , <a href="http://live365.com/">Live365.com</a> and <a href="http://fark.com/">Fark.com</a> .  The most popular commercial sites are <a href="http://niketown.com/">Niketown.com</a> , <a href="http://www.apple.com/">Apple</a> and <a href="http://www.apple.com/itunes/">iTunes</a> , as well as Live365.com, <a href="http://www.emusic.com/">eMusic</a> and Niketown.com, respectively. <br><br>  The overwhelming majority of those who download podcasts are men (75%), the <a href="http://www.mediaweek.com/mw/news/media_agencies/article_display.jsp%3Fvnu_content_id%3D1002876981">report said</a> .  A regular listener downloads from one to three podcasts a week, and 38% of respondents said that because of podcasts, they began to listen to the radio much less frequently. <br><br>  Analysts emphasize that the podcasts, despite their unusual nature, have already managed to attract a number of large advertisers.  For example, paper manufacturer Dixie sponsors a series of podcasts.  Other advertisers include Sony Pictures, Shell Oil, Earthlink, Warner Bros., HP and GoDaddy.  But advertisers need to be very careful: about 60% of listeners admitted that they immediately scroll through ads as soon as they hear its first sounds. <br><br>  An interesting fact is that podcasts are beginning to be used for commercial purposes by large companies.  For example, travel agency Orbitz lays out on its website podcasts, guides to attractions.  Some financial firms even publish podcasts with financial analytics, and for free. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/4211/">https://habr.com/ru/post/4211/</a></p>
