RUS</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  This summer will be decisive in the fight for the Russian Cyrillic domain.  In any case, registrars and state representatives are trying to convince users of this.  Two candidates are competing for the status of the ‚ÄúCyrillic zone‚Äù in Russia - ., which is actively supported, in particular, by the company <a href="http://nic.ru/">RU-CENTER</a> , iRU, which is traditionally associated with the activities <a href="http://webnames.ru/">of Regtime</a> . <br><br>  The results of the <a href="http://icann.org/">ICANN</a> Paris Conference, at first glance, seriously strengthened the position of supporters. RF, leaving no chance for competitors.  As it turned out, this is far from the case.  If fighters for RF. Rely on the <a href="http://telnews.ru/theme/17562">fast-track</a> procedure, then popularizers of the domain. RU bet on a <a href="http://telnews.ru/domains/17606/">new gTLD launch procedure</a> .  There is a high probability that in a couple of years Russia will have two Cyrillic domains at once - . and. , the latter will be considered a common domain. <br><br>  New details of the Cyrillic epic on the Russian domain market in an interview with Alexei Sozonov, director of the Russian-speaking Internet Center autonomous non-profit organization.

    <a name="habracut"></a><br>  <strong>- Many Russian users could get the impression that the Paris Conference "approved" the Cyrillic domain. The Russian Federation and "buried" the zone. RU.</strong>  <strong>How true is this?</strong> <br><br>  - To be precise, the principles of the fast-track procedure for IDN ccTLDs were simply approved in Paris.  In accordance with the principles, several applications from different organizations can be submitted by fast-track to different (or the same) IDN ccTLDs from Russia.  Who will apply from Russia and for which zones - we will find out about this in a year. <br>  <strong>- Why. RU had to turn into a three-letter domain. RUS?</strong> <br><br>  - In Paris, we conducted intensive consultations with the leadership of ICANN, the ccNSO and gNSO committees on the prospects of the Cyrillic domain that has gained popularity in Russia. <br><br>  In order to stop the development of discussions on the choice of writing the Cyrillic country code of Russia, ICANN proposed to migrate the Cyrillic zone to the domain of public domain with the possible replacement of the TLD string.  As a result of consultations, it was decided to submit an application for a common Cyrillic domain. RUS. <br><br>  <strong>- What are the main arguments that made it possible to preliminarily defend this idea in consultation with representatives of ICANN?</strong> <br><br>  - In fact, ICANN is very flexible in dealing with any issues and never imposes its own version.  In this case, the decision came by itself in the course of a constructive discussion. <br><br>  <strong>- What will happen to those domains that have already been registered in the zone.RU, with the launch. RUS?</strong> <br><br>  - After going through the procedure of accepting the application and the appearance of the zone. RUS on ICANN servers, all second-level domains in the zone. RU migrate to the zone. RUS, retaining the existing owners. <br><br>  ANO Russian-speaking Internet Center plans to do it in the very near future. RUS Aliasom.RU so that users become accustomed to their new domain before the official publication. <br><br>  <strong>- Is it possible to wait for the appearance of the second Russian domain in Cyrillic?</strong>  <strong>Supporters. RF operate in 2009.</strong> <br><br>  - It is far from clear what the first domain will be.  2009 is a figure close to reality. <br><br>  If we talk about pro.RUS, then it is 1-2 years - no more. <br><br>  <strong>- Does Runet need two Cyrillic domains?</strong>  <strong>How can they coexist?</strong> <br><br>  - Domen.RUS is not tied to the territory, and is designed for all Russian-speaking users of the Network living on Earth, therefore its relevance is not questioned. <br><br>  <strong>- Consideration of the application, according to not yet approved rules, will result in a substantial amount.</strong>  <strong>So, journalists called estimates of $ 100-500 thousand. Are such investments in the new domain justified?</strong>  <strong>Especially when you consider the presence of a competitor in the form.</strong> <br><br>  - The price of the issue will be about 250,000 USD.  This figure is quite ‚Äúcapable of‚Äù the domain business. <br><br>  <strong>- Share, please, current statistics on the domain. RU.</strong>  <strong>What is the total number of registrations?</strong>  <strong>How fast has this zone been growing lately?</strong> <strong><br></strong> <br>  - Zona.RU is commensurable in total volume and number of registrations with the zone .SU.  In recent years, the growth rate of the zone. RU as well as the Cyrillic - .COM, .NET, and .ORG - have increased. <br><br>  Source: <a href="http://telnews.ru/event/17657">telnews.ru</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/28918/">https://habr.com/ru/post/28918/</a></p>
