Tell me, if I ask you to name the best mobile camera in the current generation of smartphones, which manufacturer will you call?  And in the past?  And before last?  I am sure that the cherished little letters of LG, we will not see how much back in history do not move.  No matter how regrettable this fact was, but with cameras (in the opinion of both users and online publications) LG-smartphones always had some ... errm ... not that even difficulties or problems.  There was awful software with cameras.  And now, 2013, the LGA G2 is shown at IFA and a miracle is being accomplished: LG Finally, they overcame the problem of software and the new flagship makes great shots. <br><br><img src="http://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/539/52e/321/53952e32126d1bdc81b08f548d13bd48.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Do not believe?  Then I ask you to click the ‚Äúread more‚Äù button, check out the test shots of foreign reporters, read their opinions and make sure that now everything is really ok.

      <b>UPD:</b> Pictures sometimes fail, fakshu if I see troubles, in the comments you can not write about it. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h1>  Theory </h1><br>  Nexus 4, optimus G, G pro frankly could not boast the best shots in the industry, despite the efforts of marketers, advertisers and PR people.  Physics and software can not be fooled.  But now we have hope that at least G and G PRO will be able to improve their position: in the new flagship LG G2 there is an improved matrix from G PRO, a completely new software responsible for processing the signal coming from the photosensitive sensor.  I hope that when upgrading to 4.4 or 4.3, these backporting features will be transferred to the ‚Äúyounger‚Äù models and will improve their photo capacity.  As for the LG G2, its camera is a small piece of art.  The lens is protected from damage by durable sapphire glass, the camera module is equipped with an optical stabilization system, an improved automatic focusing system, plus, again, a new software.  But these are all words and lyrics, let's better check out the facts and photos! <br><br><h1>  Practice </h1><br>  As a competitor for the G2, Phonearena editors chose the well-known Falgman (at the time of testing) devices: Galaxy S4, HTC One, iPhone 5 and a mirrorless Lumix GH2 camera (micro four thirds system).  It is strange that the smartphone from Sony did not participate in the test, but, I think, without the participation of Xperia Z, the results will be quite timely and easily interpretable. <br><br><h1>  Street shot </h1><br>  Perhaps, a good half of the frames on a smartphone are done under the open sky, in a variety of conditions.  Morning, afternoon, evening, night, snow, rain, sunny, overcast, fog - conditions a million, and the camera alone.  The software needs to correctly estimate the lightness, set exposure parameters, white balance, sensitivity, make metering and generally do a bunch of calculations, but that funny little man will now turn away ... In general, evaluate about fifty different factors, choose the correct settings, perform focusing - and all this on the go.  The task is not simple, well, yes, and engineers knowingly get their salary. <br><br>  I myself know that sometimes the devices are not shaken for weeks, and when they fall into your hands ... In general, the weather will spoil, and the music will become rotten, and there will be nothing to test, as usual.  In this case, almost all test frames were executed on cloudy days, with soft and scattered light.  Conditions are good for evaluating the detail of frames, but not ideal for evaluating the contrast and the operation of the automatic exposure meter. <br><br>  Here are six different cityscapes, on the basis of which we will conduct our mini-analysis.  As a reference (and the first frame), take a frame from a Panasonic GH2 camera. <br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Church</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  Panasonic GH2: <br> <a href="http://armarium.org/4aa"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/850/c98/4fa/850c984fa3776830457314f35dfc711d.jpg" alt="4pOzY.jpg"></a> <br>  I would not call the work of the exposure meter perfect: the sky was overexposed, the trees became almost black, but I don‚Äôt have any complaints about the main object of the shooting: the church turned out to be very realistic color, the details are clearly visible.  Cars and their license plates are quite distinguishable, signs across the road can be more or less disassembled.  About the distortion of optics, I think, to talk in this case is meaningless. <br><hr><br>  LG G2: <br> <a href="http://armarium.org/4ak"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/23e/248/f13/23e248f1330b3b848027deb64a3f5d31.jpg" alt="zIL3T.jpg"></a> <br>  The light meter gave preference to the details of the sky and the normal lighting of the church.  The trees turned out to be even darker, but yes their area (compared to the sky, asphalt and church) on the frame is not so large, so the work of the algorithm can be understood.  License plates and signs are distinguishable.  The color rendition may not be perfect, but to call it bad I cannot turn my tongue. <br><hr><br>  Galaxy S4: <br> <a href="http://armarium.org/4aC"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/6cc/3e2/975/6cc3e2975139d21996446c0513712026.jpg" alt="ZKVOM5.jpg"></a> <br>  Here the light meter preferred dark areas to light.  The sky is lightened (but not overexposed), the trees got a greenish tint, the asphalt is lighter, and the white balance is lost in ‚Äúwarm‚Äù tones.  I can not say for sure, the problems with the hands of the operator or with the smartphone, but to distinguish between the numbers of cars and the text on some signs is somewhat more complicated than in the previous two frames.  The frame seems less contrast compared to competitors, but this is precisely because of the comparison, I think that in actual shooting the camera chose fairly good settings and tried to keep the colors in dark areas, sacrificing the contrast of the sky. <br><hr><br>  iPhone: <br> <a href="http://armarium.org/4ac"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/78d/478/447/78d478447cffec1bcdc1ac98e2eddee8.jpg" alt="9HktLNm8r.jpg"></a> <br>  The situation is in many ways similar to the one we saw in the previous frame.  Retraction of white balance, priority in dark areas.  Is that the eight megapixel model and enhanced contrast killed completely the ability to read the signs across the road and almost all the numbers of cars. <br><hr><br>  HTC: <br> <a href="http://armarium.org/4aD"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/472/5c4/4f2/4725c44f288fe5b9d8e18f0c9e8ea576.jpg" alt="H4KRv.jpg"></a> <br><br>  The most indecent frame.  Galaxy S2 shoots about the same, probably.  The sky is overexposed, there is no need to mark about the inscriptions through dorrog, since at least the trees turned out green.  White balance has the same problem as the galaxy / iphone.  But ultra pixels, yes. <br></div></div><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Crossroads</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  Panasonic GH2: <br> <a href="http://armarium.org/4pJ"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/cb6/907/49a/cb690749a5fe1b312e1905bccb970f31.jpg" alt="gFlRxyv.jpg"></a> <br>  Excellent contrast, sharpness, exposure and white balance.  Neutral and nice frame. <br><hr><br>  LG G2: <br> <a href="http://armarium.org/4pb"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/80e/045/a5c/80e045a5c857f70096a057926255308b.jpg" alt="2kZ9iOHw.jpg"></a> <br>  Slightly less sharpness of the frame (but the size of the matrix, please note, is not comparable, and the optics), again the exposure is a bit distracted towards the priority of lights.  Decent frame, comparable to that obtained on the ‚Äúreference‚Äù camera. <br><hr><br>  Galaxy S4: <br> <a href="http://armarium.org/4p8"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/642/8b6/d07/6428b6d0752ee20b0d98d4d83c1f8bf9.jpg" alt="yiMo0x.jpg"></a> <br>  As you can see, the story is repeated with the church.  White balance is shifted, priority is given to dark areas, which is why the sky is whitened.  Sharpness also diminished.  The rest - the frame is not bad.  Adjusted for smartphone.  :) <br><hr><br>  iPhone: <br> <a href="http://armarium.org/4pm"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c5d/7ab/799/c5d7ab799924edf93d75e9a6177da8f9.jpg" alt="4L6QRhKoI.jpg"></a> <br>  Here with the white balance, everything is in order, but with the exposure there are some oddities.  Again, the frame is overly contrasted. <br><hr><br>  HTC: <br> <a href="http://armarium.org/4pQ"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ecf/8a1/31f/ecf8a131ff5c6a26bb2a33b0d58cfed8.jpg" alt="ZWqscnd.jpg"></a> <br>  One in his repertoire: highlights in the sky, lack of detail, dull colors. <br></div></div><br>  Further frames will go without comment, if the trends continue (so as not to repeat the same thing), if not - I will give a brief summary under the photograph. <br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Tree against the sky</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  Panasonic GH2: <br> <a href="http://armarium.org/4pV"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/5a7/fd7/eaf/5a7fd7eaf262e797c5b6355c8b4efe88.jpg" alt="aAyMLDWQU.jpg"></a> <br>  There is some overexposure, the colors are preserved, the light blue of the sky is noticeable. <br><hr><br>  LG G2: <br> <a href="http://armarium.org/4pd"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/bf8/218/03e/bf821803ef4530f14241a47b05eb495c.jpg" alt="vs8jam7eYX.jpg"></a> <br>  All the same as in the previous two test shots.  A little lighter than the camera, a little less detail, otherwise - everything is about the same. <br><hr><br>  Galaxy S4: <br> <a href="http://armarium.org/4pl"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/04d/a25/faf/04da25faf72cedea99b0984538fbf3f7.jpg" alt="p6P2Os.jpg"></a> <br>  The sky is in trouble, but the tree turned out quite well. <br><hr><br>  iPhone: <br> <a href="http://armarium.org/4pz"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/9dd/9fa/521/9dd9fa5218ff7f20ef4568c84d61b12c.jpg" alt="tFgXm.jpg"></a> <br>  In his repertoire.

Notice how wonderful chromatite is on the leaves! <br></div></div><br>  As you can see, LG G2 has learned to shoot, and not just anyhow, but at the level of the best classmates.  Galaxy S4 is odd with BB and metering, the iPhone makes everything more contrast, and HTC has obvious problems with color rendering, exposure, and frame resolution. <br><br><h1>  Color rendition </h1><br>  Sinitis?  Reds?  Yellow?  Yes, even green.  How to set up, so it will be removed.  Unfortunately, we have smartphones, and not SLR cameras with the ability to fine-tune color profiles.  As soon as such an opportunity appears, then we will blame our own crooked hands, but for now it remains only to send curses (or blessings) to the side of programmers and engineers.  How they tune and write, so we remove.  :( The software is automatic, yes. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Flower bed</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  Difficult photo task for smartphone camera.  Approximately equally the entire field of the frame is occupied by two colors, green and yellow-orange.

In addition to the already familiar night, sport, panoramic shooting modes, there are also ‚Äúunusual‚Äù ones.<font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Super-fast continuous shooting, the so-called ‚Äúdual shot‚Äù (frame simultaneously on the rear and front camera), smart corrector mode, when during the development of a file, the camera‚Äôs software independently analyzes the image and highlights with a dotted line picture of the place. Then offers them to erase. Not to say that in everyday life these modes are very relevant and important, but sometimes you have to get out of the existing situation with what you have. Well, in such a case, the presence of a function is not an absence, they will be useful.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">About video recording, probably, there will be a separate detailed post, but I just cannot not mention the camera's operation modes in video recording. First, the new autofocus system uses a fully mobile unit of optics with stepper drive, which allows the use of silent tracking autofocus when recording video. Secondly, there is an interesting feature called AudioZoom: the camera has access to three microphones on the ‚Äúbody‚Äù of the smartphone, and the new audio signal processing chip allows (even having such a small ‚Äústereo base‚Äù) to separate the signals in time, and, after analyzing the picture from the camera and incoming sound, make sure that a certain object in the field of view of the camera will be heard well, and the rest - a little muffled. The functionality, of course, is not JamesBond, but the result is and it really feels when viewed.</font></font><br><br><h1>  Results </h1><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">We looked at four modern smartphones and one camera in the most popular shooting conditions. What can be said about the results? </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Galaxy S4, LG G2 and, of course, Panasonic Lumix GH2 in most cases choose the most correct settings, try to squeeze as much as possible all the juices from the available capacities and behave decently. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The iPhone stands apart because of its own OS, and because of its results. No, he is not bad, and the frames are not bad, they are just ... ‚Äúother‚Äù. Well, but on the iDevice screen, they look good. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">HTC in the majority of tests showed the worst result. Still, the ultra-pixel camera and HTC Zoe software need to be improved. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Well, I also want to say that for some time LG really has a great camera in a smartphone. Thank you for your attention and to new meetings in Habr√©.</font></font></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/200050/">https://habr.com/ru/post/200050/</a></p>
