Perhaps it will help someone to save a lot of time and nerves. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  It all began quite banal: I had the expiration date of my passport in the fall, but I didn‚Äôt see the point of running and making a new one right away, because  From <a href="http://informatio.ru/2010/03/biometricheskij-zagranpasport-s-1-marta-2010-budet-imeet-srok-10-let/">March 1, 2010,</a> in our country it was planned to issue biometric passports of a new generation for a period of 10 years, and, as it became known a little later, <a href="http://www.rb.ru/topstory/society/2010/03/01/150034.html">from April 1</a> this could be done through the website gosuslugi.ru.  I am a lazy person, I don‚Äôt like to stand in queues at the Department of the Federal Migration Service, and besides, there was an opportunity to personally see the work of our e-government. <br>  Registration went smoothly, on the morning of April 22 I received an "offline" letter with access codes, and here it began ... <br>  After 15 minutes, killed by filling out the questionnaire, ‚Äúfitting‚Äù the photos to the desired format, I received a response from the system ‚ÄúThere was a technical failure, please try again later‚Äù.  Fortunately, on the site in the most conspicuous place is the telephone hotline, in which the girl with a sweet voice said that everything will be fine.  After N-attempts (fortunately, when updating to F5 POST-data of the forms are sent again quite successfully) in the evening my profile was accepted by the system.  An e-mail has the following notification: <br><br>  <i>Hello!</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>Your application is registered on the Portal 04/22/2010 20:49:33.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Application number XXXX.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>To track the status of the application, you can follow the link.</i>

      At that moment, it never occurred to me that I had to take their word for it and follow their instructions clearly.  Nevertheless, a week passed, the second was coming to an end, May was in the yard, there was no sign of the site, although both the mail and the mobile phone are indicated, and then I thought: ‚ÄúBut let me go to my personal account! "... <br>  And here the most interesting begins: from April 23 I left a message with the following content: <br><br>  <i>Invitation.</i>  <i>The application is accepted, you are invited to take pictures 04/28/2010.</i>  <i>at 15h</i>  <i>30 min.</i>  <i>in 4 cab.</i>  <i>at the address XXXXXX OUFMS RF MO in XXXXXX, you should have with you: 1. Application in one copy on the letterhead of the established form 2. Basic document certifying the applicant's identity and copy thereof 3. Receipt of payment of state duty for issuing a passport 4. Military ID with a note on the completion of military service on conscription or a corresponding certificate of the military commissariat at the place of residence (stay) that the citizen on the day of filing the application is not called up for military service or is not sent to alternative civilian service</i>  <i>Bu 6. Information about labor activity indicated in the application, appendix to the application, certified by the head of the organization or its personnel departments (bodies) at the main place of work (service, study) of the applicant (04/23/2010 6:29:13 PM)</i> <br><br>  There was no limit to my indignation, but panic is not our method!  I call the already familiar telephone hotline with a request to clarify the situation and also tell me what to do next.  In response, the same sweet female voice pointed to the perpetrators of this disgrace: this is my department of the OUFMS, and although I tried to explain that the department was department, the service was provided by your portal, I did not hear anything intelligible in response. <br><br>  On this, I did not stop.  In my personal account, it turned out to be a rather useful (as it seemed to me at that time) function - ‚ÄúAppeal‚Äù.  I described the situation, told me that it would be great if your clients received at least some kind of notification, whether it be mail or a mobile phone, and very quietly waited for the reaction (it was May 8-10 in the yard). <br><br>  On May 18th I receive the following letter: <br>  <i>Hello!</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>The status of your application ‚Ññ updated:</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Invitation.</i>  <i>The application is accepted, you are invited to take pictures 04/28/2010.</i>  <i>at 15h</i>  <i>30 min.</i>  <i>in 4 cab.</i>  <i>at the address XXXX OUFMS RF MO in the XXXX, you should have with you: 1. Application in one copy on the letterhead of the established form 2. Basic document certifying the applicant‚Äôs identity and copy thereof 3. Receipt of payment of the state duty for issuing a passport 4. Military ID with a note on the completion of military service on conscription or a corresponding certificate from the military commissariat at the place of residence (stay) that a citizen is not called up for military service on the day of filing an application or is not sent to alternative civilian service 6.</i>  <i>Information about employment, specified in the application, appendix to the application, certified by the head of the organization or its personnel units (bodies) at the main place of work (service, study) of the applicant (04/23/2010 6:29:13 PM)</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>To track the status of the application, you can follow the link.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>- Respectfully,</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Administration of the Internet portal of public services.</i> <br><br>  And again, an explosion of emotions, but this time - positive.  It really was even funny.  Knowing that this would lead to nothing, but I nevertheless answered with quoting directly to this letter with the following text: ‚ÄúAnd nothing, that it has already been 3 weeks?!‚Äù.  I received no answer to this day ... <br>  Let's not forget that I also left the appeal in my account.  I thought that, probably, as with the statement, they write only on the portal, however, after going there, the ‚ÄúAppeal‚Äù section was no longer found by me at all.  Probably, "reduced." <br><br>  In general, I ended up passing like all normal people are offline, and as for the portal itself, either they don‚Äôt go skiing, or I ... <br><br>  PS Today, in the personal account of the application, the status is ‚ÄúSuspended due to failure to appear for taking photographs within 15 days from the date of filing‚Äù.  I wonder why this? .. <br><br>  <b>UPD 07/08/2010</b> <br>  And here is the letter with my appeal, it took just 2 months without a week to register it.  I wonder when the answer will come?  Are there so many hits? <br><br>  <i>Hello!</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>Thank you for the suggestions on the work of the Unified Portal of State and</i> <i><br></i>  <i>municipal services.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Your message will be considered when preparing proposals for</i> <i><br></i>  <i>development of the Portal.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>This email has been sent via the case handling system,</i> <i><br></i>  <i>he does not need to answer.</i>  <i>If you have questions send them through the portal</i> <i><br></i>  <i>re.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>Respectfully,</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Customer Service</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Single portal of state and municipal services</i> <i><br></i>  <i><a href="http://www.gosuslugi.ru/">www.gosuslugi.ru</a></i> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/97483/">https://habr.com/ru/post/97483/</a></p>
