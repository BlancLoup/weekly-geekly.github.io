  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Why can not grow money</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  And there are genetic reasons for this. <br><br>  Practically everyone who has completed secondary school people know that there is a concept of ‚Äúhomeostasis‚Äù - constancy of the internal environment of the organism.  And, at the same time, rarely anyone knows about the concept of ‚Äúallostasis‚Äù - the constancy of the internal environment through the interaction of the organism with the external environment. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/kg/mt/jp/kgmtjpvaejhehazr5eecz-pdvma.jpeg"><br><blockquote>  Allostasis and allostatic overload.  A little stress tones and energizes the body.  Body systems adapt to stress without overvoltage.  When allostatic overload the body finds some kind of balance, but it works with difficulty and gradually breaks. </blockquote><br>  In fact, maintaining homeostasis requires support from the body's behavior: where to live, what to drink and eat, whom to avoid, what to strive for.  Just as genetically an organism is programmed to maintain the constancy of the internal environment, so its behavior should not disrupt homeostasis, otherwise the mechanisms of natural selection for the organism will work. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b>Allostasis on the example of eating</b> <br><br>  A person‚Äôs standard of living reflects itself in vital processes: if you are used to eating meat three times a day, the body‚Äôs biochemistry adapts to this way of supplying nutrients for work and will rebel during a sudden change of diet. 
      <br>

      If the meat is eaten twice a day, the body will still tolerate, but the transition to vegetarian food will cause a pronounced adaptive response - within 2-3 weeks the body will adapt to the unusual food.  Depending on the adaptation reserves, there will be either too good or too poor overall condition.  If you persist further - you can get to the exhaustion of the adaptation reaction and get sick on the background of well-being, or fall into a depressive state. <br><br>  Usually in 2-3 weeks there comes a period of rollback - when it is unbearable to eat the unbearable. <br><br>  At this point, old food habits usually return, which prevents the depletion of adaptive mechanisms.  It is easy to feel this moment when you return from the country with exotic cuisine to your homeland - it‚Äôs good there, but at home, your own. <br><br>  The same situation occurs when income changes: with a sharp decrease or increase in income, an adaptation reaction occurs, as a result, the body tries to reach its previous level of well-being. <br><br>  <b>A simple test for the level of allostatic load of money</b> <br><br>  Try your feelings on thoughts of how much money you can safely spend.  At each level, record your feelings. <br><br>  5 rubles <br>  10 rubles <br>  20 rubles <br>  50 rubles <br>  150 rubles <br>  450 rubles <br>  5 000 rubles <br>  20 000 rubles <br>  80 000 rubles <br>  350 000 rubles <br>  1,000,000 rubles <br>  10 000 000 rubles <br>  100 000 000 rubles <br>  1,000,000,000 rubles <br><br>  Initially, the sums do not cause any tension, as the sum grows, the sensation of optimum appears - I can easily afford it.  The higher the amount after the optimum, the greater the concern that so much money can be spent, even to the point of horror (‚Äúyes, I don‚Äôt earn so much for life‚Äù). <br><br>  At some point, the psyche simply ceases to perceive large numbers, and for most people spending 1,000,000,000 just seems unrealistic and doesn‚Äôt feel anything about it ‚Äî billions of expenditure parts of a budget are so easy to read. <br><br>  <b>Allostasis and a sharp increase in income</b> <br><br>  The same situation happens when you set yourself new financial goals.  At times, it is difficult to increase revenues or raise money for a very expensive purchase, as the body will try to maintain allostasis. <br><br>  On many cash trainings, they put super income goals: ‚ÄúBecome a millionaire or die.‚Äù  At the peak of adaptation, people sometimes get great results, on the wave of results there are rave reviews about the training.  However, after 2-3 weeks, a period comes when the body says ‚Äúenough‚Äù - a rollback occurs. <br><br>  Often incomes subside in such a way that it would be better to remain in the old state - the body needs to return the allostasis to its usual state and tries to prove to the consciousness that it does not need such sharp experiments. <br><br>  At the same time, there is a more comfortable growth model - to get used to the increase in disposable income gradually.  Usually, it takes from 6 to 12 months for homeostasis to catch up with changes in income by 30%. <br><br>  Knowing that allostasis has a certain optimal speed of adaptation, it makes sense to gradually, in small portions, allow ourselves to get used to a better standard of living before increasing disposable income: to buy better food, slightly better clothes or shoes, to buy expensive toilet paper.  The more an organism gets used to a new quality of life, the easier it is to find sources of growth for income. <br><br>  What to do if revenues grew by more than 30% in a short time?  Safe in terms of allostasis behavior is to exclude this extra money from everyday life.  Someone will merge them into the casino, someone will put on a long deposit in the bank, someone will <s>drink</s> / <s>distribute to the</s> poor. <br><br>  <b>Allostasis and a sharp drop in income</b> <br><br>  When the usual level of income falls, the homeostasis system also requires returning the allostasis to the site.  And this is noticeable by the fact how quickly a job with a similar income level is after losing the old one.  About one or two months - and a healthy person closes the need for the standard of living to which he was used. <br><br>  The recommendation on the level of financial "airbag" for two months of optimal life activity is based on this feature of the body. <br><br>  More information about the concept of allostasis as a continuation of homeostasis can be found in the book by Robert Sapolsky Psychology of Stress.  Why zebras have no stomach ulcers. ‚Äù <br><br>  <b>UPD</b> <br><br>  There was a place for inviting to open classes on March 26 and 28. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/444636/">https://habr.com/ru/post/444636/</a></p>
