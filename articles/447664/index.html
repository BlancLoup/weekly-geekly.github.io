It is aimed at entrepreneurs who have always believed that end-to-end analytics are cool, but very expensive and only suitable for giants, large companies. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h3>  What is end-to-end analytics? </h3><br>  End-to-end analytics makes marketers - Super Marketers.  It helps to determine and follow the path of the client from the first click, which could be long before the purchase until the happy moment, when the satisfied customer leaves with the purchase home, or not home, maybe somewhere else.  But the main thing is that he brought money to the company!  And we, in our turn, see where he pressed what he wrote to the manager, when he called, how long he thought about buying, how much he had cost us all this time and whether the investment in it paid off for our company. <br><br><h3>  What does end-to-end analytics give? </h3><br>  If you are an entrepreneur, a top manager or just all Russia in an enterprise, the analyst will tell: <br><br><ul><li>  How much sales the company brings marketing, and how much word of mouth radio, customer recommendations and personal developments of managers. </li><li>  Exact conversion numbers from Lids to sales for each specific channel.  Immediately it becomes clear who from the departments of "Marketing!" Or "Sales!" (Eternal opposition) "nakosyachil" for what period. </li><li>  Whether the cost of advertising on the Internet and not only pays off, and you can demand explanations about the budget spent last month. </li></ul><br>  If you are a marketer at an enterprise, then end-to-end analytics will open your eyes, give you new super-glasses, with which everything will suddenly become clear:

    <ul><li>  A report will appear on the advertising sources that bring real sales to the company. </li><li>  You will find a narrow neck in your funnel and you will be able to press Lidov at each stage of the funnel with the help of pinpoint marketing communications. </li><li>  Learn the payback of each advertising source, each marketing campaign and maximize ROMI (return on marketing investment) </li><li>  In general, before you open a new level of web analytics, sales analytics, marketing analytics.  You will see conversions not only by source, but also by region, gender, age. </li></ul><br>  <b>Important!</b>  <b>You will understand for yourself and tell the manager what advertising budget has flown into the pipe due to broken deals.</b>  <b>You will have weighty arguments for the ability to influence sales.</b> <br><br>  <b>How it works?</b> <br><br>  It works by integrating a web analyst with sales.  Below I will describe in detail the 3 basic processes that need to be implemented in the enterprise, to increase its effectiveness.  I want to draw attention, each process must be a continuation of the previous one.  So web analytics statistics should not be divorced from call statistics, calls from sales, and so on.  We need to see the full picture of the cash on hand.  This is important, otherwise the system does not make sense.  Otherwise, the confrontation of marketing and sales will never disappear. <br><br><h3>  Base: Advertising sources + Call-Tracking + CRM <br>  Advertising sources.  Web analytics </h3><br>  Most likely you use a huge number of advertising sites to attract customers to the business.  We understand that one contextual advertising is not enough, we are looking for sales on social networks, on free sites, in catalogs, on otzoviki and so on.  And rightly so, everything changes very quickly, you need to be as flexible as possible and use all the possibilities to achieve the desired results. <br><br>  But all these actions need to be monitored.  The time of the intuitive choice of a particular site has passed.  Need to rely on numbers. <br><br>  <b>And so let's say you have:</b> <br><br>  <i>- SEO search queries</i> <i><br></i>  <i>- Advertise on blogs</i> <i><br></i>  <i>- Contextual advertising in Yandex Contextual advertising in Google</i> <i><br></i>  <i>- Posts on the forums</i> <i><br></i>  <i>- Flyers</i> <i><br></i>  <i>- Social networks</i> <i><br></i>  <i>- Paid banners on popular sites</i> <i><br></i>  <i>- Ratings</i> <i><br></i>  <i>- Market Place</i> <br><br>  And of course many others.  If you are using my first acquaintance with the term "End-to-End Analytics" - most likely you consider only the number of hits, and even more precisely - you do not have a specific figure how many people came from each channel, and how much more money you earned on it in revenue and profits. <br><br>  <i>But if you collect web analytics data on the main sites - this is good!</i>  <i>So you implement a through analytical culture will be easier by a third.</i> <br><br><h3>  CallTracking / Call Tracking </h3><br>  This is a technology that monitors customer calls to the company by phone and associates these messages with a specific advertising source.  In essence, this is a code that is installed on the site and collects call statistics, but call-tracking can also be used for offline marketing promotions, indicating on the flyer the phone associated only with a specific event. <br><br>  The basis of this system is the substitution of numbers.  Instead of the contact phone number of your company, it demonstrates a replacement number to a potential client.  Then it matches it with a specific advertising source. <br><br>  <b>Let's follow the client's path by example:</b> <br><br><ol><li>  The client moved to the site from the advertising platform; </li><li>  He sees a replacement phone number and calls the company; </li><li>  The call goes to the virtual PBX; </li><li>  After the call, all the information about it enters the call log, which already has all the information about this client. </li></ol><br>  <b>As a rule, there are 2 types of call tracking:</b> <br><br><ol><li>  Static </li><li>  Dynamic </li></ol><br>  <b>Static</b> or classic: <br><br><ol><li>  Assigns a separate number to each source of advertising; </li><li>  Can be used on offline advertising - in magazines, on leaflets and other surfaces. </li></ol><br>  <b>Dynamic:</b> <br><br><ol><li>  Different site visitors are shown different phone numbers; </li><li>  Matches the call with a specific visit; </li><li>  It is possible to trace in detail the source of the appeal - down to the keyword; </li><li>  Requires the purchase of more numbers, because at the same time there can be many people on the site and each will have their own number. </li></ol><br><h3>  CRM </h3><br>  <i>All of the above shows the effectiveness of marketing and advertising, but this is not the main thing.</i>  <i>Business is the main sale, revenue, profit - money to the box office!</i>  <i>Previous tools are nothing without prime.</i>  <i>CRM.</i> <br><br>  <b>What is CRM?</b> <br><br>  This is a customer relationship management system.  In simple terms, this is a program in which our managers communicate with the client.  This is necessary to increase sales, optimize marketing, maintain the entire history of the relationship with the customer, analyze the results. <br><br>  <b>In order to choose a CRM system you need to answer 2 questions:</b> <br><br>  <i>Question 1:</i> Who will work on the system?  Only sales or other departments too? <br>  <i>Question 2:</i> What functional tasks should the system solve? <br><br>  <b>Implementing a CRM system in a company's business processes, we immediately influence 2 main processes:</b> <br><br>  1. Primary sale <br>  2. Subsequent work with the client <br><br>  <b>For primary sales:</b> <br>  <i>Increase profits.</i>  The seller has complete customer information and sales history.  The number of transactions and the speed of the transaction.  Easily focus on the best deals. <br><br>  <i>Improving the accuracy of sales forecasting.</i>  Statistical information allows you to estimate the likelihood of a deal and to predict the rate at which customers travel through the sales funnel, which allows you to effectively manage the company's cash flow. <br><br>  <i>Increase the likelihood of a deal</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Cost reduction</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Increase employee productivity</i> <br><br>  <b>With further work with clients:</b> <br><br>  <i>Improving the quality of service.</i>  Complete customer information allows you to more accurately identify the category of appeal and accurately determine the required resource to solve the problem.  No need to switch to other customer service representatives during a conversation with a customer. <br><br>  <i>Increase customer satisfaction.</i>  The client is expected to work with a company that always provides information accurately and in a timely manner, maintains regular contact with him, always solves service problems in a timely and qualitative manner, treats him personalized, and any person in the company has complete information about interaction with him. <br><br>  <i>Develop customer loyalty Reduce support service costs.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Increase average check.</i> <br><br><h4>  What conclusions need to be made after reading this article? </h4><br><ol><li>  Introduce analytical culture in the company.  Companies need end-to-end analytics.  We need to know what part of the investment budget for advertising is not effective in order to invest in an effective one!  There are low-cost cloud solutions - We know these solutions - contact, set up. </li><li>  Use CRM if you do not already have it. </li><li>  Use Call Tracking for offline marketing and advertising campaigns. </li><li>  Wins fast, flexible, one who uses the opportunities that gives the market this second. </li></ol><br>  <i>Author: Maxim Lednev - the founder of LEDNEV.PRO, an expert in building marketing strategy and analytics, a certified Yandex and Google specialist, the official partner of Bitrix 24, AmoCRM and Roistat.</i> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/447664/">https://habr.com/ru/post/447664/</a></p>
