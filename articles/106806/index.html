    <h4>  GUI tools </h4><br>  If you are reading this article to solve a couple of nuances and do not delve into - I can recommend to try the GUI-tools <a href="http://pulseaudio.org/wiki/AboutPulseAudio">described on the PulseAudio page</a> .  With the help of <code>pavucontrol</code> you can quickly select a ‚Äúdefault‚Äù recording device (Input Devices, button on the right ‚ÄúSet as fallback‚Äù) and Skype will work :) Also <code>pavucontrol</code> allows <code>pavucontrol</code> to control the volume of the overall and individual applications. <br><br><h4>  Basic PulseAudio </h4><br><h5>  Card, Sink &amp; Source </h5><br>  It is known that the sound card has two types of sockets: inputs (line in, microphone) and outputs (headphones, line out, S / PDIF).  In a typical configuration, for each available sound card and its ‚Äúnests‚Äù PulseAudio creates the following objects: <br><ul><li>  <b>Card</b> .  The object represents a physical sound card with all its inputs and outputs; </li><li>  <b>Sink</b> (English nisina) - "drain", receiving audio stream.  Represents the sound card output: line-out, headphones, laptop speakers; </li><li>  <b>Source</b> (English source) - the source of the sound that creates the audio stream.  Represents the sound card input: line input, microphone. </li></ul><br>  PulseAudio defines ‚Äúdefault Sink‚Äù and ‚Äúdefault Source‚Äù: objects used by default for newly launched applications. <br>  I note that Sink does not have to describe the physical port of the sound card: it is an abstraction of the sound stream receiver.  PulseAudio is a high-level thing and allows you to create very ‚Äútricky‚Äù objects: for example, Sink of the 'NULL' type (implemented by the PulseAudio module-null-sink module) simply absorbs the sound, and the module-pipe-sink module allows you to stream audio through the FIFO file.  You can also create network Sink'i, leading multicast-broadcasting or transmitting the audio stream to a specific host.  All this is implemented by PulseAudio modules. <br><br>  So, the sound is played through ‚ÄúSink‚Äù, and recorded through ‚ÄúSource‚Äù. <br><br><h5>  Sink-Input &amp; Source-Output </h5><br><ul><li>  <b>Sink-Input</b> .  When an application that supports PulseAudio is about to play a sound, it sends its output to one of the announced Sinks and becomes the ‚ÄúSink Input‚Äù: Sink Input.  An application can create multiple output streams by creating separate Sink-Input'y for each stream. </li><li>  <b>Source output</b> .  If the application is going to receive sound from some Source (sound recording), it becomes ‚ÄúSource's output‚Äù: Source-Output. </li></ul><br>  Each Sink-Input defaults to contacting one of the Sinks and transmits an audio stream.  PulseAudio then determines what Sink is connected with (for example, a sound card) and sends it to its destination. <br>  There is a special type of Source: Monitor.  For each Sink, a separate monitor can be created to allow recording.  So, it turns out to record "sound from the speakers." <br><br>  So, the media player creates Sink-Input, and Skype - and Sink-Input, and Source-Output. <br><br><h5>  module, client, sample </h5><br>  Within the article - purely information :) <br><ul><li>  <b>Module</b> .  PulseAudio module loaded.  For example, loading a module-alsa-sink with specifying parameters that point to an Alsa device will create a Sink associated with this device.  There are other modules that create PulseAudio objects that allow you to control it, use the FIFO to exchange audio stream, and much more; </li><li>  <b>Client</b> .  Application connected to PulseAudio.  It can create Sink-Input and Source-Output streams and control the PulseAudio daemon. </li><li>  <b>Sample</b> .  Sound sample loaded into PulseAudio for fast playback.  Can be used to play standard sounds.  For example, x11 bell.  Can be played on command from a module, client or console. </li></ul><br><br><h4>  ALSA ‚Üí PulseAudio </h4><br>  Of course, you first need to make sure that PulseAudio is installed and running: <br> <code>sudo apt-get install pulseaudio <br> pulseaudio --start -D <br></code> <br>  Not every application can work directly with PulseAudio: they usually know how to use Alsa.  For such applications, it is necessary to inform Alsa to redirect their audio streams to PulseAudio. <br>  To do this, <code>~/.asoundrc</code> insert the following lines into the <code>~/.asoundrc</code> file ( <b>which, by the way, will cure Skype‚Äôs microphone!</b> If you also turn off ‚ÄúAllow Skype to automatically adjust the volume‚Äù - suggests <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/users/aim/" class="user_link">aim</a> ): <br> <code>pcm.pulse { type pulse } <br> ctl.pulse { type pulse } <br> pcm.!default { type pulse } <br> ctl.!default { type pulse } <br></code> <br>  The first two lines will create an ALSA virtual device named 'pulse' for input and output, as well as a volume control device.  The following two define them as ‚Äúby default‚Äù: now all applications instead of Alsa will use PulseAudio through a special plugin (and not to suspect anything). <br>  To apply the changes, you need to restart the sound applications.  Freshly launched applications will pick up the changes themselves. <br>  UPD: <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/users/yuretsz/" class="user_link">yuretsz</a> <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/linux/106806/">tells you</a> that applications using OSS ( <code>/dev/dsp</code> ) need to be launched via the <code>padsp [options] PROGRAM [ARGUMENTS ...]</code> wrapper. <br><br><h4>  Control PulseAudio: pactl </h4><br>  PulseAudio is controlled by the pactl command, which cannot be said to be comfortable and advanced :) however, we will train with it. <br><br><h5>  Property Inspection </h5><br>  First, let's see what we have: what objects are defined in PulseAudio.  I recommend to start background music to have something to watch :) <br>  The <code>pactl list</code> command will show a long list of existing objects. <br>  Each object has a set of fields describing it, as well as a special field ‚ÄúProperties‚Äù: a list of key-value properties (usually string). <br>  All objects have index (Sink # 0) - a unique number of an object of a certain type.  Also, many objects have names (Name:): index and Name can be used to refer to a specific object. <br><br>  I recommend to look at the fields of the Sink and Source objects: by default, they describe your hardware. <br>  I will show my example: <br><pre> Sink # 1 - Sink: reproduces sound

</pre><br><br><h5>  pactl &amp; pacmd </h5><br>  In addition to pactl, there is another utility for managing PulseAudio: <code>pacmd</code> . <br>  If a module-cli-protocol module is connected to PulseAudio, a UNIX socket is created on which the PulseAudio-shell hangs.  This is a lot like telnet :) <br>  Shell accepts text commands and executes them.  <code>pacmd help</code> will show a list of available commands. <br>  The problem is that <code>pactl</code> is not able to do everything, and <code>pacmd</code> not so easy to use.  In the future, we will stick with <code>pactl</code> , but if its functionality is not enough, we use <code>pacmd</code> . <br>  At the end of the article I will demonstrate my own utility that works on top of the standard ones: much more functional and convenient :) <br><br><h5>  Card Profile: sound card port mapping </h5><br>  The sound card has a limited number of connectors, and there can be a lot of applications for them: you can use everything for 5.1 audio output and leave one for the microphone;  or leave one jack for stereo output, but get the microphone and linear inputs;  or‚Ä¶ <br>  Alas, magic is not a ride: the sets are preinstalled by the manufacturer.  Their list can be viewed in the ‚ÄúProfiles‚Äù field of the ‚ÄúCard‚Äù object. <br>  Each profile is given priority (priority): a number that determines the ‚Äúdegree of attractiveness‚Äù of this particular profile.  By default, PulseAudio selects the profile with the highest priority. <br>  For each profile, it is indicated how many Sinks and Source'ov it will generate if you select it: <code>sinks: 1, sources: 0</code> . <br><br>  At the moment, you can not change priorities, but you can choose one or another profile. <br>  In the <code>pactl list</code> output, we <code>pactl list</code> name of the map and profile, and select: <br> <code>pactl set-card-profile 'alsa_card.pci-0000_00_1b.0' 'output:analog-stereo+input:analog-stereo'</code> <br>  Everything, ports of the card are reassigned. <br>  You can generally turn off all connectors by selecting the "off" profile: <br> <code>pactl set-card-profile 'alsa_card.pci-0000_00_1b.0' 'off'</code> <br> <br><h5>  Sink Port: switching sound to headphones </h5><br>  One Sink can have several audio ports.  For example, Sink created on the basis of a sound card of a laptop, can have two ports: built-in speakers and a headphone output. <br>  Sink's current port can be viewed in its <code>Active Port: analog-output-speaker</code> field <code>Active Port: analog-output-speaker</code> . <br>  Looking at the Ports list of the required Sink object, assign the port: <br> <code>pactl set-sink-port 'alsa_output.pci-0000_00_1b.0.analog-stereo' 'analog-output'</code> <br>  and the sound is instantly transferred to the headphones, turning off the speakers. <br>  Similarly for Source.  Perhaps your microphone does not work in Skype precisely because the wrong recording port is selected :) <br><br><h5>  Default Sink: default audio output </h5><br>  PulseAudio marks one of Sinks as ‚Äúdefault‚Äù: new running applications by default will be played through it.  In other words, if the application does not select Sink itself (for example, from user settings) when creating a Sink-Input, default-sink is selected. <br>  The default Sink can be viewed by running the <code>pactl stat</code> command: <br> <code>$ pactl stat <br> ... <br> Default Sink: alsa_output.pci-0000_00_1b.0.analog-stereo <br> Default Source: alsa_input.usb-046d_0802_0825F490-02-U0x46d0x802.analog-mono</code> <br>  Let's change it: look at the name of the desired Sink and write: <br> <code>pacmd set-default-sink '1'</code> <br>  Note that <code>pacmd</code> in some cases allows the use of numbers instead of long names. <br>  Similarly for Source.  By the way, an incorrectly chosen default-Source can also prevent you from talking to Skype :) <br><br><h5>  Move Sink-Input: move audio stream </h5><br>  With this action you can transfer Sink-Input from one Sink to another.  In this way, you can transfer music to a newly connected USB speaker. <br>  We look at the names of two Sinks, find the required Sink-Input and write: <br> <code>pactl move-sink-input 16 '1'</code> <br>  and the Sink-Input # 16 sound instantly switches to Sink # 1.  This may be a USB speaker. <br>  Alas, it is impossible to transfer all Sink-Input'y at <code>pactl</code> using <code>pactl</code> or <code>pacmd</code> .  At the end of the article will be a solution. <br>  Source-Output can also be switched between Source'ami. <br><br><h5>  Volume control </h5><br>  The volume in PulseAudio is set numerically: 0..65535 (corresponds to 0% and 100%), and also - a surprise!  - Values ‚Äã‚Äãgreater than 100% cause signal amplification, which is indispensable when watching movies with unnormalized volume. <br>  Here you can use Sink's index: <br> <code>pactl set-sink-volume '1' 100 #  ! 100/65535 = 0,15% <br> pactl set-sink-volume '1' 65535 # 100% <br> pactl set-sink-volume '1' 78642 # 120% ‚Äî  <br> pactl set-sink-mute '1' true #   </code> <br>  Gain can cause clipping: the well-known "bounce". <br>  Similarly, you can control the volume of the Source. <br>  <b>UPD</b> : since version 0.9.15, the ‚ÄúFLAT_VOLUME‚Äù feature has appeared (it can be seen in Sink 'Flags').  With this flag, Sink's volume is automatically set as the maximum volume of all Sink-Input.  You can disable it like this: <br> <code>echo "flat-volumes = no" &gt;&gt; /etc/pulse/daemon.conf</code> <br> <br><h5>  Application volume </h5><br>  With the advent of Windows7, Linux users, not familiar with PulseAudio, were envious of the ability to adjust the volume of individual applications :) <br>  Now it is possible: we look at the index of the required Sink-Input and strengthen the separate application: <br> <code>pactl set-sink-input-volume '16' 80000 <br></code> <br><br><h5>  Suspense </h5><br>  Sink and Source can ‚Äúpause‚Äù: <br> <code>pactl suspend-sink '1'</code> <br> <br><h4>  Config </h4><br>  When the thought comes to your mind to add one of these commands to autoload, immediately throw it away!  In such cases, use the PulseAudio configuration file. <br>  An example can be found in the <code>/etc/pulse/default.pa</code> file.  Pay attention to shebang <code>#!/usr/bin/pulseaudio -nF</code> : this is a script whose syntax is very similar to commands that <code>pacmd</code> understands. <br>  For self-education: <br><ul><li>  <code>pacmd</code> - Runs the PulseAudio interactive console. </li><li>  <code>pacmd help</code> - list of commands, <a href="http://www.pulseaudio.org/wiki/CLI">offsite</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://www.pulseaudio.org/wiki/Modules">PulseAudio Modules</a> </li></ul><br><br><h4>  patricks </h4><br>  Having been tortured by the inconvenience of official utilities, your faithful servant wrote his utility to manage the PulseAudio daemon :) <br><br>  Features: <br><ul><li>  Short, intuitive commands </li><li>  Dosed presentation of information with the <code>ls</code> : now a ton of information (especially properties) will not be dumped into the terminal </li><li>  All objects - including ports and profiles - can be set both by name and by index </li><li>  The command <code>set sink 0 port next</code> - you can not guess the port number and just switch to the next one.  Convenient for hotkeys. </li><li>  The presence of the command <code>mv sink 0 all</code> to move all audio streams in the desired Sink (USB-Column) </li></ul><br>  You can eat on GitHub: <a href="http://github.com/ootync/Patricks">ootync / Patricks</a> <br>  (put the script files somewhere and make a symlink on patricks.php) <br><br>  Work example: <br>  See the list of Sinks.
