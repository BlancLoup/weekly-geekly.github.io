Keep a gaming blog as if no one leaves.  A lot of projects claimed the level of "best" or "first in Russia", but in any way.  Sooner or later, the author's commands fall apart, and the sites cease to exist for a short time.  Why is that? <br><br>  If you compare the number of gaming blogs in Russia with blogs devoted to the topic of earnings in the network, the spread is monstrous: for 1 gaming blog found on the network, there are about a dozen blogs about the monetization of everything and everything.  The network has an incredible number of rich people and those who know how to make a pyramid of bills, having at hand only a personal computer, but few constantly updated gaming blogs with interesting news and articles.  And for some reason the same number of second ones is steadily growing (although the posts often repeat each other on all points), and the first in the afternoon cannot be found with fire: most of them either go down to the level of second-rate ‚Äúwarez-portals‚Äù that are already nauseous close after dropping to two or three updates per month.  The reasons? <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The first and most important reason that gaming blogs do not gain popularity is the incredible competition from giant sites like ag.ru and igromania.ru.  The first, roughly speaking, diminishes most of the traffic from you / us, the second steals all users from your / our forums.  In addition, over the past few years, a huge number of game portals have divorced on the Internet, where text is given less space than a file archive (as a result, such a site is a repository of demo versions and sometimes high-quality reviews).  These portals consist of thousands of non-informative pages, which most often appear on the top of search engines due to high PR and TIC of the main page and invested funds in the promotion.  As a result, gaming blogs live on 5-10 pages in the output, of course, only the selected ones go through there.  Services like ‚Äúblog search‚Äù do not help much: in Yandex, the chance to get a visitor to a page with a post is high only in the first hours after its placement.  After some time, it is replaced by other similar keyword entries.

      The second problem is the non-popularity of blogs.  Many smart people have long understood that reading the author's opinion is much more interesting than the stupid description of the game product and the link to the demo version download, but the problem with gaming sites: it seems that not everyone has understood this truth.  Here you can find out how many per month users enter queries for certain keywords in Yandex.  Type "blog game" and see how many people from the beginning of the month introduced this combination.  Pops most often picks up "download the game" and "flash games" (apparently, the second request mostly comes from children and office workers).  And on your / our "subjective notes and the incorruptible truth about games" to spit a lot, however regrettable it may sound.  Therefore, it is often necessary to maneuver between the volumetric blogging and short notes about demos and fresh trailers, which bring most of the visitors from search engines. <br><br>  Another significant problem arises directly from the previous ones: it‚Äôs almost impossible to become a visited and popular blog due to a lack of visitors, and therefore it‚Äôs not realistic to receive money.  To gain popularity, the project needs a daily and very frequent update for a very long time.  Agree that on one enthusiasm to work two or three years, very few people will become, and one author who keeps a blog will not be able to provide for the frequent addition of news. <br><br>  The last two problems that I almost forgot to say are eternal laziness and eternal competition.  So, apparently, it is our way: to forget to do what should and proudly not refer to anyone. <br><br>  <em>After all, a competitor may become more popular, and so it is impossible!</em> <br><br>  The statement above is idiocy;  if you decide to blog, forget, it‚Äôs better to gather a circle of friends and colleagues than competitors and envious ones.  For now. <br><br>  <em>Article from the blog <a href="http://www.progam.ru/">progam.ru</a> , my first article, laid out on Habr√©, please do not judge strictly and do not minus much;)</em> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/23388/">https://habr.com/ru/post/23388/</a></p>
