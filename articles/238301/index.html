  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The near future: wearable devices in a smart city</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Imagine that each of the people will be forced to carry a device that tracks its location, dispatching the carrier‚Äôs communication with other people and even controlling biological rhythms, many authors have tried in their works.  The mention of wearable devices has been drifting in various works of art for 2,000 years.  From the Apocalypse of John the Theologian to the works of Lemma, the Strugatsky, Bestuzhev-Lada and Toffler.  But it is unlikely that they seriously thought that their advanced descendants would go for it voluntarily, and sometimes they would even fight for the right to be the first to become the owner of a wonderful device. <br><br>  Let us imagine for a moment the near future, when the market of wearable devices will cease to be new, products of this class will become mass, and smart bracelets and watches will turn into natural satellites of a person, as in their time they became a mobile phone or a bank card. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/196/757/2cd/1967572cd35c45548e9212adf63c6ce5.jpg" width="600"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  One morning in the smart city </h4><br>  In the notification center warned about the upcoming night of the magnetic storm.  I went to bed, but still could not sleep.  He counted the projected sheep on the ceiling, flipping through the recordings of meetings with friends.  That evening I didn‚Äôt even break the diet, eating only an apple under the approving bicking of the fridge, but to no avail.  The huge moon shone through the window, and there was an incessant hum in my head.

      It was possible to fall asleep somewhere at half past four in the morning, and at 08:45 the bracelet was already buzzing on the wrist.  I got up with difficulty, feeling overwhelmed in the land of the zombies, who were raised, but forgot to wake up.  Shower, clothes, scooter and to work.  Today was not up to fitness, so I drove all the way on the electric drive.  I remember only ten years ago, when in Moscow, only at public stops, there were poor information screens with weather and arrival time of the next three buses, I had to wait at some intersections for a green man for 160 seconds.  Now we have stopped noticing many things, it is enough for me to just go, the ‚Äúgreen wave‚Äù will be optimally constructed for all road users.  If at a particular intersection there is a weak stream of cars, and the number of bracelets identified at a traffic light is more than usual, the City automatically reduces the intervals of traffic lights.  So we run all the time, there is no time even to stick on the traffic lights.  But all the time you stay in good shape. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/fc3/48d/93b/fc348d93b9c84e30926f58bb80e25746.jpg" width="600"><br><br>  Hmm, I have already met the third accident along the way, have they all gone crazy today?  No, I still don't want a car.  He didn‚Äôt want it even 10 and 15 years ago.  Yes, parking has become easier, the adviser suggests and pre-book a parking space, the efficiency of road services has increased, evacuators seem to know in advance tense places and come to difficult areas the night before, on empty roads.  Today there are a lot of them.  Apparently not only I slept badly today. <br><br>  By the way, I have only 7,900 rubles left to the new financial goal.  Planned a trip to Lake Baikal, I want to take a break from the whole figure.  My bank transfers from my main account to a special one for 100 rubles for each thousand calories I have spent.  At first it looked like some kind of deception or marketing gimmick, but later I got involved.  It seems to be stupid: the bank pays you with your money for keeping yourself in good shape.  But as soon as the phone appears in this equation, from the screen of which the avatar looks at you sadly every time you exceed your daily budget or buy a too fat lunch in the office canteen, everything becomes completely different.  You find yourself in the magical world of emotions, where it seems to be not so boring than in the usual megalopolis.  So I got involved. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a07/fb0/33b/a07fb033bcbd41499bede95c05446150.jpg" width="600"><br><br>  From my thoughts I pulled out the disgusting squeak indicator of the scooter battery, I forgot to charge it again yesterday. <br><br>  - Siri, Yes, when will you enter the charging of gadgets into my plans for the day ?! <br>  ‚ÄúYou didn‚Äôt do morning exercises.‚Äù <br>  - Siri, so that you die, you stupid bitch! <br>  - 300 meters from the public stop there is a charging unit.  At 305 meters pharmacy. <br><br>  Yes exactly.  It is necessary to buy something from the head, so as not to kill your favorite colleagues in the office. <br><br>  Parked, put a scooter in the socket, go to the pharmacy, and on the first shelf painkillers and energy.  Yesterday there was a cure for cold, but I must say thanks to the bracelets.  It is said that network pharmacies, due to purchases from suppliers of wristbands about quality of sleep last night, raise sales of specific products by 30% the next morning. <br><br>  Means from a head, an energy bar, I am late for work.  By the way, it will be necessary to adjust the standard route, it is already autumn, and it‚Äôs cold to go part of the way along the embankment.  You will have to drive along the highway again, the adviser will again force you to eat more fruit.  I'm tired!  I want to eat a hefty burger with double fries, even if I get a notation from the doctor again, natural meat is worth it! <br><br>  Previously, in order not to annoy the doctor, it was enough for me to simply not post food on Instagram, but now my medical card is synchronized with a set of products from the banking history of purchases and biorhythms from the bracelet. <br><br>  Strangely, at the last intersection in front of the office, there are already four minutes for two people.  Is the traffic light dead?  No, my route is not rebuilt.  Probably again these outcasts.  Need to drive up, skip.  And then they will get stuck before lunch, until the machines disappear at all and the ‚Äúgreen by default‚Äù lights up. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/8e8/a60/527/8e8a60527533438ab48af664691fef1b.jpg" width="600"><br><br>  When the majority receives some kind of good, it soon becomes the norm, the commonplace.  But in any society and in virtually any context, there are those who are not on the path with the majority for various reasons.  In our case, there were two "bracelets" at the traffic light. <br><br>  Yes, we live in a free society, but once you leave gadgets at home, you will be hopelessly late everywhere.  And it's not even the best route or recommended shopping list.  Just try without a bracelet to get a green traffic light signal. <br><br>  I got there, was marked at the entrance with a bracelet, my delay was fixed and will definitely affect my salary.  Colleagues met the usual trolling, we live on. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/238301/">https://habr.com/ru/post/238301/</a></p>
