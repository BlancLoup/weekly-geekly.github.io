  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Is it worth being ‚Äúsuccessful‚Äù?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"> How tired of these thematic articles about improving performance, motivation and other nonsense.  Why do people write them?  To help those who are entangled in themselves?  For those who are hard to concentrate on?  Hardly so. <br><br>  Modern life dictates that everything needs to be done quickly, to achieve maximum efficiency.  You must be very successful.  We need to move to the goal, every day, every hour, every minute.  Leaving all the excess, throw all the strength to achieve the result.  Otherwise there is no point in living. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Friends call for a drink?  From such it is better to stay away, because if you drink with them, then the evening is lost, and then tomorrow.  But this time is so important to achieve goals.  Leave these friends, do not communicate with them.

      Feeling bad, tired, no strength?  Nonsense, come on, is it tiredness?  That soldier in the war, he gets tired, but does not give up.  And what are you, is it tiredness, enough to rub snot, get up from the couch and go ahead, reach the goal. <br><br>  Do not know how to get together and motivate yourself?  Slack  Read articles, books, textbooks manuals, look at the example of others, those who forced themselves to achieve the goal.  They will certainly help you. <br><br>  Don't waste time on bullshit.  Do not watch TV, do not lie in bed after the alarm bell, do not stand in traffic jams, etc.  etc. <br><br>  Some particularly talented authors, as much as possible, try to motivate people to become more successful.  You can not do not.  Lie down, spit in the ceiling.  So stay, forgotten, not needed, not successful, not motivated.  And you do not want, lift your ass and let's do something.  Just do not lie, do not sit, do not sleep, do not waste time and so on.  Unfortunately, these articles are weakly motivated, and indeed, more similar to the practice of verbiage. <br><br>  <b>I'm tired.</b>  <b>All this is rubbish, nonsense, heresy.</b>  <b>Just noise.</b>  <b>These are all words.</b> <br><br>  In fact, for each person the values ‚Äã‚Äãof life, success and goals are unique.  We all have different needs, different motivation.  And this is a fact.  If there is not enough motivation, then it is not.  And do not try to look for it in someone's books, words, morals.  If the book is not readable, then most likely you are simply not interested, so why force yourself? <br><br>  Now it has become very fashionable to be goal-oriented, result-oriented, successful.  If you do not work on achieving some goal, then you are not a success, you smoke the air, you degrade.  Being not successful is not cool. <br><br>  Absolutely every person has his own criteria for peace of mind and personal happiness.  For one, it is a strong family, healthy children, a warm cozy home.  For another - a cool car, a trendy smartphone.  For the third - to be in sight, at the hearing.  And so on. <br><br>  But we are told that we must constantly strive for new heights, manage time, every second must be in the name of something.  They are deceiving us, trying to make us live by laws that are alien to the ordinary living person.  We are inculcated with the habit of living according to a schedule, according to strict plans, to always go forward.  Step to the right / left-run, got up a little, thought about something and you were already bounced, you were late again. <br><br>  Man is not a machine, he can and must have weaknesses, succumb to them.  In this race for efficiency, we lose ourselves, our present.  We often live with dubious goals, ideas that are alien to us, far-fetched, not real.  But for us they write articles, shoot videos, conduct seminars on motivation.  To squeeze out of us a little more, a little more, to make life more efficient. <br><br>  People who are entangled in their own lives, looking for ways out of the impasse, often do not help, but inculcate complexes.  Can't you reach your goal?  You're a loser.  Read the article and still have not set to work?  You are a pathetic loser.  And so on. <br><br>  What to do to those who want to change something in their lives?  How to overcome fatigue and apathy?  How to find the strength to do something?  How to improve your performance for yourself? <br><br>  It is possible that very motivated and successful people, this will seem nonsense.  But everything stated below has always helped me and my loved ones.  I am sure that all these tips you have ever heard. <br><br>  1) Take a pause.  This is the most important step.  If you are confused, dispersed, can not get down to business, drop it for a while.  Give your nervous system a rest.  Such use of time only seems to be ineffective, wasted.  In fact, just remember the famous expression - ‚ÄúAll diseases from the nerves‚Äù, it is quite true.  Only one BUT, do not lie all the time in bed trying to sleep for the future.  Go to the cinema in which you have long wanted to go, to the circus with the children, with your wife to the restaurant, read a book for which there was no time.  Ride a bike, sledding, skiing.  You can even get drunk in the trash with friends losers. <br><br>  2) While relaxing, try to establish a more or less clear mode of the day.  Doctors recommend to sleep about 8 hours a day.  In fact, the duration of sleep is different for everyone, but the average value is still about 8 hours. <br>  Since you are resting now, you can estimate how much sleep you need for you.  Be sure to go to bed at the time when you have planned and get up on time, do not pour.  All other cases during the day should be structured so that the time of lifting and falling asleep is the same daily. <br>  Here, many will object, saying I get up at work at 6 in the morning, come home because of traffic jams only at 9 pm, and at 10 I have to go to bed, but when will I live?  And what in this case is meant by the word live?  Sitting in ‚Äúclassmates‚Äù, or in front of a zombie box?  Or do you want to convince me that getting up at 6 am and arriving home at 21 o'clock, can you have a good time before you sleep?  Maybe, but not everyone is capable of this, and it is very easy to burn out.  So it's better to sleep.  Remember that sleep is rest not only for arms and legs, but also for the brain and nervous system as a whole. <br><br>  3) Allocate personal time in your daily routine.  It may be an hour a day, or a whole day, maybe half an hour on Saturdays.  This time is only for you, there can be no work here.  Just you and your hobby or whatever.  Read, sing, go to the gym, run, but at least with the men in dominoes at the entrance to play.  Be sure to use this private time, if there is no business, just walk around the park or the street.  Just like that, without thoughts, without goals.  It is like a breath of air for your nervous system.  Unloading time  It only seems that such a trick is useless, but try to put these minutes in hours, days, weeks.  Not a little, right? <br><br>  4) Get yourself a pocket notebook.  Not a diary, but a notebook, without dates, numbers, etc. You can put them yourself when needed.  At first, you will not need it, you will not know what to write there.  But still, carry it with you.  Over time, you will realize that recording something is very convenient.  Write there your thoughts, interesting ideas, and everything that seems important to you. <br>  This habit will help you to become more collected, quietly, quietly.  Many believe that this dulls the memory.  Do not believe, record, analyze, return to the thoughts is very useful and to the same such analysis is also a rest for your nervous system. <br>  Just do not need to use a smartphone for this purpose.  You need a notebook.  Living sensations, the creaking of a pen on paper, the rustling of sheets of a notebook, a trace of ink, the unevenness of your underline, or vice versa, its perfectly aligned strokes.  These feelings are very important, do not change them to stupid buttons or a soulless touch-screen. <br><br>  5) Eat right.  Yes, yes it is about food.  Do not think this is garbage.  We eat very poorly.  I just don‚Äôt need to say that I can‚Äôt eat differently, it‚Äôs more convenient for me to eat sandwiches on the run and drink powdered coffee from a vending machine.  Try to eat real foods - cereals, vegetables, fruits, eggs, cottage cheese, cheese, meat.  Avoid fast food - bars, sandwiches, soda, quick soups, sausages, sausages, sweets, muffins, chips. <br>  Of course, I do not urge you to give up these things altogether.  Just take a sober look at your diet and see how much normal food there is and how fast and convenient it is.  If convenience predominates in your diet, then be aware that food is partly to blame for your tiredness and slowness. <br><br>  And the last.  Do not try on someone else's success.  Finish measuring the success of life for other people.  It is often said that he / she is a 23-year-old millionaire / businessman / merchant / owner of a large company, etc., and you, who are you in your 30th? What difference does it make?  Of course it is good to have millions, to have an oil well is also probably good, it's great to have a full garage of sports wheelbarrows and a house on the coast.  All this is just fine.  But in the end it's up to you. <br><br>  Take a look around, look into yourself.  You have a wife who loves you, and you her.  You have a cozy, albeit two-room apartment, which your grandfather left you and you have not earned it for 5 years, so be it.  You have a wonderful son / daughter, you have time to communicate with them and this communication gives you joy.  You leave for the summer in the country, to the village, feed the horseflies there and plant radishes, go shit in the spectacled toilet, well, cool.  Enjoy it, do not delve into the causes of other people's victories comparing them with your failures, this is a dead end.  Do what you like and do not break yourself in favor of unattainable goals, but you will achieve real ones. <br><br>  In the end, not everyone can be millionaires or creators of grand startups. <br>  Do not be afraid to make mistakes, laugh at your failures, do not pay attention to those who do not believe in you.  It will not help you.  Believe in yourself, believe your loved ones, ask them for help, go your own way. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/129863/">https://habr.com/ru/post/129863/</a></p>
