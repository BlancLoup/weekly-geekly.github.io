    <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  The combat work of radio operators is no less than the work of telephone operators and line overseers, replete with examples of courage and heroism.  And they had to work under enemy fire, taking a personal part in the battle if the situation required it.  Here are a few of the feats of military communications men: <br><br>  It was impossible to manage without continuous management and close cooperation in the Battle of Kursk.  Radio communication was the only means of controlling tank forces, and it was also involved in the violation of wire communications. <br><br>  The telephone operator V.P. repeatedly corrected cable impulses under a flurry of fire.  Ponomarev.  In one day, he sometimes had to repair up to 30-40 damage.  If it was impossible to reestablish the connection, the telephonist became on foot connected.  For heroism, Private Ponomarev was awarded the title Hero of the Soviet Union. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c45/ef7/0d2/c45ef70d28414788b63468c15f5cdb83.jpeg" alt="image"><br><br>  Telephone operator V.A.  Yatsenyevich showed heroism, until the last time he served the telephone exchange, passing on information about the enemy, being already surrounded.  He died in brutal torture.  The title of Hero of the Soviet Union V.A.  Yatenevich awarded posthumously. <br>  In the armies of the 2nd Belorussian Front, the provision of wire communications was difficult.  Signalers simply did not have time to build communication lines - the offensive was so swiftly carried out. <br><br>  During the crossing of the Vistula, the cable connection across the river was ensured by sergeant F.D.  Razin, later awarded the title Hero of the Soviet Union, and the corporal N.N.  Kralya, awarded the Order of Lenin. <br><br>  When laying two cable lines across the Oder River, four out of five telephone operators were killed.  Corporal V.A.  Mitryaev alone laid both lines, and then, being wounded in the enemy's crouch, he called fire on himself.  This broke the enemy's counterattack, and V.A, Mitryayev, for his military feat, received the title of Hero of the Soviet Union. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/51a/fcc/806/51afcc80682749c1b939517614d78fea.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  When storming the Reichstag to ensure communication, there was not enough cable.  The commander of the telephone department A.I.  Kozlov quickly tracked down the German cable in the ruins of the houses, fought off the enemy, and secured communications.  For which he was awarded the tenth award during the war - the Order of the Red Star. <br><br>  There are also cases when the signalmen, when they broke the wire, being wounded, connected the ends with their teeth and provided communication even after death ... <br><br>  The provision of communications during the war years was incomplete.  Throughout the war, the troops felt a lack, especially in the automotive versions of the RAT.  In 1941-1942, the front headquarters had only one radio station, and only by the end of 1942 did they manage to provide them with second sets of these stations, which made it possible to maintain uninterrupted communications with the General Staff.  At the same time, the availability of RAT radio stations with an application to 76 radio stations amounted to only 23 radio stations, that is 32% of the required one. <br><br>  To create a full-fledged connection, the lines of the General Staff-Front and Front-Front lines were used. <br><br>  The only means of ensuring radio communication of the General Staff with the fronts during the whole war was the radio station PAT, developed in 1936 at the plant.  Comintern in Leningrad.  The radio station PAT was produced in two versions: fixed and mobile.  The mobile version of the radio station was mounted in one ZIS-6 machine (power unit) and two ZIS-5 machines (transmitting and receiving parts).  The stationary version during the war years was called the Dal-G and was fundamentally different from the automobile only as a power source. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a59/6bd/486/a596bd4861ce4b3b926d78917c55bc3f.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  With the beginning of the war, the release of radio stations PAT was significantly increased compared to the prewar period, but it was not possible to expand production to a level fully satisfying the needs of the troops because of the inability to supply manufacturers with components (radio tubes, generators and engines).  In addition, it was decided to replace high-quality materials with simpler materials by radio stations, and not to fully process parts (silver plating, copper plating, chrome plating, etc.), which naturally had a negative effect on the quality of the product.  It should also be noted that the quality of radio stations produced during the initial period of the war was very low, due to the widespread belief that the duration of the radio station would be short during hostilities and quickly destroyed by the enemy. <br><br>  In total, the deliveries of the RAT radio station during the war years to the troops were: in 1941 - 0, 1942 - 14 pcs., In 1943 - 27 pcs.  This problem was aggravated by large losses of the RAT, especially at the beginning of the war.  For comparison: in the six months from June 22, 41 to December 31, the Red Army lost 19 radio stations, and over the next three and a half years, 13 radio stations. <br><br>  Accuracy and stability of the working frequencies of the transmitter RAT were ensured by applying the original scheme of obtaining a grid of operating frequencies by converting the frequencies of a short-wave quartz oscillator and a smooth-band long-wave oscillator, followed by separating their total and difference frequencies, which ensured working frequencies in the range from 1.25 to , 3 MHz, and with two- and threefold multiplication in subsequent cascades - in the range from 2.5 to 12 MHz.  The accuracy and stability of operating frequencies were mainly determined by a quartz oscillator, since the frequencies of a smooth-band oscillator were 7‚Äì20 times lower than the frequencies of a quartz oscillator.  The use of quartz with a low temperature coefficient and their placement in a thermostat weakened the effect of changes in external temperature on the frequency of the transmitter.  The total error of the operating frequencies of the transmitter did not exceed 0.05%, which ensured high accuracy of the transmitter of a smooth frequency range. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c02/59a/c95/c0259ac95e2540e480a6ce069cd002bb.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Receivers of all radio stations that were in service during the Great Patriotic War were superheterodyne with single frequency conversion, with one, less often with two stages of amplification of intermediate and low frequencies, had a sensitivity in telephone mode 5-10 ŒºV, bandwidth 4 kHz, but significantly lagged behind the transmitters in terms of accuracy and stability of operating frequencies (the US-type receiver had an error of the operating frequency scale up to 5%). <br><br>  In a modern army, communications troops are a complex, multifunctional organism, including numerous communications centers for various purposes, many thousands of kilometers of radio, radio relay, tropospheric, wired, and other communications lines. <br>  The equipment used in the troops at the moment is very developed and functional, but does not exclude the old, time-tested, telephone lines such as point-to-point that have been very reliable for a long time due to the ease of implementation.  For example, the TA-57 telephone, which is still used in combat units of many types of troops, is used for communication when organizing combat security positions between remote combat guard posts (PBO) deployed in the form of temporary fortifications on the ground.  These devices are connected by the same ‚Äúvole‚Äù (wire P-274 M) which is very difficult to damage. <br><br>  The device itself is made of a very durable carbolite case and is powered by a battery type GB-10-U-1.3 with a voltage of 10 V which is able to work for 6 months, but often this battery is replaced by a simple ‚Äúcrown‚Äù on which the TA-57 does not lose in the duration of work.  There is also a manual generator in it, with the help of which an inductor call is made, for the call it is necessary to turn the handle of the inductor and the bell is activated at the opposite end. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/506/bcb/388/506bcb388b3b4a749ea18986a6178127.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  These devices are also used with telephony systems and work according to the ‚Äústar‚Äù scheme, in which the switch is the center, there is an operator on the switch that connects the subscribers, that is, to call someone, you need to rotate the inductor handle when the switch operator answers the call. what subscriber needs a connection, the operator switches to the desired subscriber, having first made him a call from the switch. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b93/361/f95/b93361f95b6246f98a6dc5c84f4c295e.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  As you see, from the times of the Great Patriotic War, some technical developments are still used in our army.  We once again congratulate everyone on the Great Victory Day and hope that not only technology, but also the heroism of the past years are alive in our Army. <br><habracut></habracut></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/257545/">https://habr.com/ru/post/257545/</a></p>
