      Not everything is lost! <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Against the background of all the bad news, the cryptocurrency market shows its growth first, and then, under the influence of the trolls in the face of Mark Hearn and the company R3, it panics and Bitcoin drops to $ 360. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/786/11f/1b9/78611f1b97498c90b175b5db9b557486.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  But unlike the stock market, the cryptocurrency market comes to life very quickly, and calms down.  At the time of this writing, the cost of Bitcoin exceeded $ 410.  And this is despite the fact that the entire cryptocurrency market is capitalized for less than $ 8 billion. <br><br>  What is the reason?  <i>The reason is blockchain technology, which is now breaking into the state and financial sector.</i> <br><br>  1. January 19, 2016 The UK government has <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/technology-35344843">debated</a> blockchain technology and has found many uses for this technology for the benefit of the state, from paying taxes to storing public records.  I recommend to familiarize with this <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/492972/gs-16-1-distributed-ledger-technology.pdf">document</a> . <br>  2. 01.20.2016 R3 (which Mark Hearn allegedly left), conducted an <a href="http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/r3-connects-11-banks-distributed-ledger-using-ethereum-microsoft-azure-1539044">interbank transaction test on the</a> Ethereum fork in the Amazon cloud, for the 11 largest banks whose joint capital exceeds 757 billion US dollars.  The test results are not reported.  R3 spokesman Tim Swanson (Tim Swanson), reports that testing will continue with the forks of other cryptocurrencies. <br>  3. 01.20.2016 The Central Bank of China has <a href="http%253A%252F%252Fe.t.qq.com%252Frenminyinhang">announced</a> its strategic goal to release its cryptocurrency. <br>  4. 01.26.2016 US Securities and Exchange Commission (CFTC), <a href="http://www.coindesk.com/cftc-discuss-blockchain-tech-public-hearing-january/">will hold open hearings</a> about blockchain technology. <br><br>  The applicability of the blockchain may surprise many.  Already, any self-respecting IT specialist is simply obliged to familiarize himself with the following crypto: <br>  - Emercoin (combines Namecoin and Pearcoin) and provides many decentralized services: DNS, SSH, SSL, etc. <br>  - Factom - registry of public records and confirmation of authorship <br>  - Etereum - a platform for developing decentralized applications <br>  - DASH - the existing decentralized voting system, in which the votes can not be falsified. <br><br>  The R3 company, which is going to create its own HyperLedger blockchain for the 11 largest banks (although they haven‚Äôt even decided that they eventually forknut), is now a big scarecrow on crypto exchanges.  Since it carries a threat to existing cryptocurrencies. <br><br>  Although aware of the viciousness of private blockchains, not all miners and traders. <br><br>  During times of crisis, any customer will say: ‚ÄúShow me where is my benefit from implementation?‚Äù And here, all attempts to organize private leggers will most likely be doomed to lack of competitiveness.  Why?  Yes, simply because private mining Ledgere needs private mining farms.  As a result, the customer will pay many times more than if he simply used the old data center.  Modern mining devices, of course, strive for high energy efficiency, and move the market in this direction, but consume much more power than the usual servers. <br><br>  If banks buy private blockchains, their transactions will not become cheaper, and profits will not increase. <br>  Do banks and the state need to connect to existing blockchains?  The question is not simple.  However, I propose to think about this: <br><br>  1. You pay taxes.  The state spends these taxes on the creation of a data center in which it processes data on your taxes, stores information about you, and so on, why would you not process this information instead of these data centers, receiving payments from the budget for this work? ? <br>  2. Using the blockchain for voting will reduce the cost of any election by orders of magnitude.  In general, this is a direct path to true democracy, - referendums can be held at least every day.  Yes, and cheating on the elections will not be profitable - very expensive. <br><br>  Yes.  For the realities of the post USSR, this technology is very ‚Äúbad‚Äù - it will become harder to cut.  And the state and banks will resist, because  the first blockchain can deprive impunity and much of the power, and the second a large chunk of profit. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/275589/">https://habr.com/ru/post/275589/</a></p>
