This article will be devoted to the verification of the design of the state machine for <s>controlling the</s> vending machine <s>trading device</s> described in the Verilog language (design) and System Verilog (verification). <br><br>  In general, the basis of the publication is my course project, which was appreciated by my teacher with the proposal to make a publication on Habr√©. <br><br>  The main thing I want to emphasize is the descriptions of typical multilayer testbench blocks and the application of some basic constructions of the SystemVerilog language and verification.  The approach that I used is the so-called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Verification_Methodology">Open Verification Methodology (OVM)</a> with changes that simplified the development of the project and were convenient for me personally.

      So let's go! <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  The specification of the device and its operation </h2><br>  The material that follows will be difficult to call the device specification, but an attempt has been made.  And that's what came out of it. <br><br>  The device being verified is Moore's finite state machine, the purpose of which is: control of the vending machine. <br><br>  Device interface: 7 input signals / buses and 6 output signals / buses.  The purpose of the signals, their width and direction for convenience are presented in a table. <br><br><table><tbody><tr><th>  <b>Signal / Bus Name</b> </th><th>  <b>Direction</b> </th><th>  <b>Digit</b> </th><th>  <b>Purpose</b> </th></tr><tr><td width="150">  i_clk </td><td width="100">  input </td><td width="100">  one </td><td>  Sync signal </td></tr><tr><td>  i_rst_n </td><td>  input </td><td>  one </td><td>  Active Low Reset Signal </td></tr><tr><td>  i_money </td><td>  input </td><td>  four </td><td>  The tire on which codes of denominations of monetary units are transferred </td></tr><tr><td>  i_money_valid </td><td>  input </td><td>  one </td><td>  Signal of code validity on the i_money bus </td></tr><tr><td>  i_product_code </td><td>  input </td><td>  four </td><td>  The bus on which pass the codes of goods </td></tr><tr><td>  i_buy </td><td>  input </td><td>  one </td><td>  Purchase Confirmation Signal </td></tr><tr><td>  i_product_ready </td><td>  input </td><td>  one </td><td>  Signal of product readiness (input, because I have accepted that another device is engaged in the preparation of the product) </td></tr><tr><td>  o_product_code </td><td>  output </td><td>  four </td><td>  Item code to be issued to the buyer </td></tr><tr><td>  o_product_valid </td><td>  output </td><td>  one </td><td>  Signal of validity of information on the bus o_product_code </td></tr><tr><td>  o_busy </td><td>  output </td><td>  one </td><td>  Signal that the state machine is busy processing the current order </td></tr><tr><td>  o_change_denomination_code </td><td>  output </td><td>  four </td><td>  Delivery, or rather codes of denominations of monetary units </td></tr><tr><td>  o_change_valid </td><td>  output </td><td>  one </td><td>  Signal of validity on the bus o_change_denomination_code </td></tr><tr><td>  o_no_change </td><td>  output </td><td>  one </td><td>  Delivery End Signal </td></tr></tbody></table><br>  The state machine has 4 states in total: CHOOSE_PRODUCT, ENTER_MONEY, GIVE_PRODUCT, GIVE_CHANGE. <br><br>  I think that from the names, in principle, it is clear what's what. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">But if it is not clear, then it should be explained</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  CHOOSE_PRODUCT: In this state, the state machine accepts the product code and waits for confirmation of the purchase. <br><br>  ENTER_MONEY: Here, mi, we give the machine a coin in the form of currency denomination codes.  The transition to the next state takes place immediately after the money in the wallet of the machine has nothing less than is needed to purchase the goods. <br><br>  GIVE_PRODUCT: Here we count the change and pass the code of the product to be prepared by the "abstract device to the performer."  The transition to the next state occurs after the receipt of the corresponding signal of product readiness from the "abstract artist". <br><br>  GIVE_CHENGE: Give change and go into standby mode, that is, CHOOSE_PRODUCT. <br></div></div><br>  I also offer your attention to any diagram of this miracle: <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/20b/00f/a9c/20b00fa9c08b42a899a4642a2e158b2e.jpg"></div><br>  ‚Üí <a href="">Description on Verilog can be found here.</a> <br><br><h2>  Actually verification </h2><br>  I would like to divide this section into two parts.  In the first one I will give the structure of the testbench, I will describe each functional block of which it consists.  The second discussion will deal with the so-called code and functional coverage and assertions. <br><br><h3>  Testbench structure </h3><br>  Let's start with a picture that illustrates the structure of the testbench. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/3e1/b8a/849/3e1b8a84993343689f31cd5ce5c3e81b.jpg"><br><br>  Consider each block separately: <br><br>  <b>DUT</b> (design under test) - this block is the description of the state machine with one small modification in the form of a wrapper, which allows the testbench units to interact with each other using the <i>interface</i> . <br><br>  In general, the <i>interface</i> is such a language design SystemVerilog, which allows you to group signals together and simplify the developer's robot.  You can do a lot of cool things with it, which you can read about in the standard for the language and a bit in this article. <br><br>  <a href="">Reference to DUT</a> <br><br>  <b>Assertions</b> - here we are at the signal level to check how consistent the behavior of our design is with the device specification. <br><br>  In this we are helped by such constructions as: <i>assert</i> , <i>property</i> , <i>sequence</i> .  We can also include the results of testing the behavior of our model in the definition of functional coverage using the <i>cover</i> construction. <br><br>  ‚Üí A <a href="">reference to Assertions</a> <br><br>  <b>Environment</b> - it can be conventionally called a container in which all other blocks live that implement verification, or in other words, a software verification environment. <br><br>  When describing it, use the <i>Program</i> construct.  Why is it so difficult to answer, for me it is also a question for now.  Perhaps this is due to the regions of the simulation simulator SystemVerilog, but this is still a guess. <br><br>  ‚Üí A <a href="">reference to the Environment</a> <br><br>  Inside the <b>Environment</b> , there are many other entities that just generate incentives for design, implement various verification scenarios, verify the accuracy of the output data and evaluate the code and functional coverage.  So, let's go to them: <br><br>  <b>Sequencer</b> is a block where scenarios are described, according to which verification will occur.  These descriptions are fairly high-level and rely on methods provided by <b>Transactor</b> .  What is remarkable here is that the workhorse of this block is usually the <i>randsequence</i> design.  Its main task is to provide a convenient way to organize a script as a sequence of calls to <b>Transactor</b> methods.  Here is the <a href="http://sagar5258.blogspot.fr/2015/12/randsequence-in-systemverilog.html">link</a> where it is well explained how to use the <i>randsequence</i> . <br><br>  ‚Üí <a href="">But what I did (Sequencer)</a> <br><br>  <b>Transactor</b> is a block that implements methods that actually serve as the basis for scripts.  At this stage, the same information is generated, which will be transmitted as input signals to our design.  And here comes the power of SystemVerilog. <br><br>  In SystemVerilog, you can make the values ‚Äã‚Äãof class fields randomly generated.  This is very useful because it allows you to significantly speed up verification.  Actually, in order to make the field randomly generated, you need to use the <i>rand</i> or <i>randc keyword</i> . <br><br>  But that is not all.  Suppose you have created a variable of type <i>int</i> , but you need to ensure that the values ‚Äã‚Äãthat it accepts are defined by a strict range (for example, you can have only certain addresses on your bus).  And on this account SystemVerilog has a present for you: a <i>constraint</i> design that allows you to restrict what properties your random variables will have.  Example from the project: <br><br><pre><code class="hljs pgsql">rand logic [ <span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">3</span></span>:<span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">0</span></span>] product_code; <span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">constraint</span></span> c_product_code { product_code inside { [ <span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">1</span></span> : <span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">8</span></span> ] }; }</code> </pre> <br>  Here I created the variable <i>product_code</i> which I limited to the interval [1; 8] using <i>c_product_code</i> . <br><br>  But there is one thing, but.  After creating an instance of a class, the variables <i>rand</i> and <i>randc are</i> not initialized by a random value.  This happens when the built-in instance method <i>randomize () is</i> called. <br><br>  Go back to <b>Transactor</b> .  The use of <i>rand</i> fields, the <i>randomize ()</i> method and its extensions <i>randomize () with</i> occurs naturally in <b>Transactor</b> .  Unlike <i>randomize ()</i> , <i>randomize () with</i> allows for its imposing additional restrictions on the <i>rand</i> field.  More details about this can be found in the language standard SystemVerilog and <a href="http://www.asic-world.com/systemverilog/random_constraint4.html">here</a> . <br><br>  ‚Üí <a href="">And of course Transactor</a> <br><br>  <b>Driver</b> is the only one who really works here.  His task is to turn the information received from <b>Transactor</b> into design input signals.  With him, everything is simple and clear.  Therefore, I will tell you a little about the <i>interface</i> design. <br><br>  These are not constructions that can be found in ordinary programming languages.  Here the <i>interface</i> is more a design that allows you to group signals, regardless of their direction, as is convenient for the user.  There are only three <i>interface</i> constructs in the project: dut_interface, vm_in_interface, vm_out_interface.  The first is the synchronization and reset signal, the second is the vending_machine input, the third is its output.  <a href="">So, it all looks</a> . <br><br>  ‚Üí <a href="">And of course - Driver</a> <br><br>  <b>IN Monitor and OUT Monitor</b> ‚Äî these blocks read information that goes into and out of the <b>DUT</b> for further validation checks.  Why read the information when entering the <b>DUT</b> , if it is stored in the <b>Driver,</b> you ask?  Everything is simple to avoid errors in the <b>driver Robot</b> and all the above blocks. <br><br>  ‚Üí <a href="">IN and OUT Monitor</a> <br><br>  <b>Checker</b> is a block that performs the verification of the compliance of the reference data that is calculated on the basis of the data obtained from the <b>IN Monitor</b> and the data obtained from the <b>OUT Monitor</b> . <br><br>  <b>Scoreboard / Functional Coverage</b> is the last block and is a hybrid of two separate blocks that perform different functions.  <b>The scoreboard</b> itself should generate reference data and generate reports upon completion of the simulation, but in this project it is not very convenient to do this, since it is small.  <b>Functional Coverage</b> by itself makes checking the coverage of all possible functions that are embedded in the device specification. <br><br>  And here we come to the juice itself, how to do <i>functional coverage</i> .  To do this, SystemVerilog has a special <i>covergroup</i> design.  In each <i>covergroup</i> you define the so-called <i>coverpoint</i> , in which the binding to a specific signal or bus on which it is checked will be checked whether all possible data variations were obtained by the design and whether all possible data appeared on its outputs. <br><br>  In general, access to the results of <i>functional coverage</i> occurs at <i>runtime</i> , so there are special functions that allow you to evaluate it later, anytime. <br><br>  One of them is the built-in function <i>$ get_coverage</i> which returns a value from 0 to 100 calculated on the basis of all cover constructions ( <i>cover</i> , <i>covergroup</i> , <i>coverpoint</i> ). <br><br>  In addition to accessing the <i>runtime</i> , the concept of <i>functional coverage</i> can also be obtained in graphical simulation environments (I can vouch for ModelSim so precisely). <br><br>  Let's move on to <i>code coverage</i> .  This indicator gives us an understanding of how much code we used was written and how complete our tests were.  If for some reason your <i>code coverage</i> does not reach your acceptable level, then there are 2 options: write a test better, or your code is excessive.  In any case, it will need to be fixed.  True, it is worth mentioning separately that there are times when, as it were, the tests are good and the design code is good, but still the <i>code coverage</i> does not suit us, then we will have to exclude something from the check. <br><br>  In general, what <i>code coverage</i> checks: <br><br><ul><li>  <b>Statement</b> - lines executed and not executed during simulation </li><li>  <b>Branches</b> - checks the execution of constructions if..else, case </li><li>  <b>Condition</b> - checks for logical conditions whose results must be <i>True</i> or <i>False</i> </li><li>  <b>Toggle</b> - checks logical transitions from 0 to 1 and vice versa </li></ul><br>  These, as well as other checks (checks of finite automata and the so-called <i>FEC Condition</i> ) give an idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe project‚Äôs <i>code coverage</i> . <br><br>  To enable the <i>code coverage</i> assessment, it is necessary to set the appropriate compiler settings for the file for which <i>code coverage</i> will be evaluated. <br><br>  ‚Üí <a href="">And, of course, I almost forgot (Scoreboard / Functional Coverage)</a> <br>  ‚Üí <a href="https://github.com/ogvalt/VM_Verification">Well, the link to the entire project</a> <br><br>  Well, that's all.  Thanks for attention.  I hope you find this article for yourself in something useful. <br><br>  Until new meetings. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/319730/">https://habr.com/ru/post/319730/</a></p>
