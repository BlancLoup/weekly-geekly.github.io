    <h3>  All for Drupal developer </h3><br>  Drupal news and articles from all over the world in our main heading: <br><ul><li>  "All technologies of the future have one common feature: the developers of the first prototypes consciously build systems with the possibility of innovation from future users."  Perhaps a controversial, and too strict statement, but maybe this explains the success of Drupal 7?  Very interesting material is waiting for you in the article <a href="https://swsblog.stanford.edu/blog/adaptive-architecture-leave-room-evolve">Adaptive Architecture: Leave Room to Evolve</a> . </li><li>  Drupal has several popular "basic" themes.  The author explains why he chose Bootstrap: <a href="http://www.digett.com/blog/12/16/2014/which-base-theme-we-use-and-why">Which Base Theme We Use (and Why)</a> . </li><li>  Don't know what a hook is?  <a href="https://3cwebservices.com/drupal/introduction-drupal-hooks">This note is</a> an example of a simple module specifically for beginners. </li><li>  In Drupal, as in any full-fledged framework, there is always room for non-trivial things, pitfalls, rakes, bicycles, etc.  In this regard, the collections of Gotcha are very interesting - this time from the developer Wunderkraut - <a href="http://www.wunderkraut.com/blog/bernts-drupal-gotchas/2014-01-21">Bernt's Drupal Gotchas</a> . </li><li>  Does the client ask you for <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A1%25D0%25B8%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B0_%25D1%2583%25D0%25BF%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B2%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D1%258F_%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B7%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BC%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BE%25D1%2582%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BE%25D1%2588%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D1%258F%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B8_%25D1%2581_%25D0%25BA%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD%25D1%2582%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B8">CRM</a> ?  Do you yourself need a customer relationship management system?  Make it on Drupal, but do not reinvent the wheel, because more than 7 different solutions are already available, to which a <a href="http://www.sitepoint.com/7-crm-options-compatible-drupal/">separate review is</a> dedicated. </li><li>  If you are developing a multilingual website and want to translate individual fields, including headers, and not all the material, be sure to read the article <a href="http://nielsdefeyter.nl/archive/201412/setup-entity-translation-right-way">Setup Entity Translation the right way</a> . </li><li>  Parsing third-party sites?  Face the problem of regular expression matching and the like?  Try using the <a href="https://import.io/">Import.IO</a> service.  Especially since it <a href="http://fourword.fourkitchens.com/article/scraping-websites-drupal-using-feeds-and-importio">integrates</a> normally with the <a href="https://www.drupal.org/project/feeds">Feeds</a> module. </li><li>  About the flexible and powerful module Views can talk endlessly.  At this time, we offer you a detailed instruction how to configure a <a href="https://www.ostraining.com/blog/drupal/filter-drupal-file-type/">tricky filter on the type of file</a> without a single line of code. <br>  If the task cannot be solved from the admin, the Views API comes to the rescue.  In an article from Appnovation, <a href="http://www.appnovation.com/blog/how-properly-use-php-drupal-views-fields">an example of customizing an embedded field</a> with code. </li><li>  ‚ÄúDrupal in active search‚Äù - I wanted so much to name this digest!  :) <br><ol><li>  A great <a href="https://3cwebservices.com/drupal/creating-faceted-search-view-drupal">introduction to faceted search</a> (with video). </li><li>  A series of articles "Apache Solr and Drupal".  Already out the <a href="http://cheppers.com/blog/apache-solr-and-drupal-part-i-set-up-apache-solr-to-enhance-drupal-search">first</a> and <a href="http://cheppers.com/blog/apache-solr-and-drupal-part-ii-how-to-set-up-drupal-and-solr-to-search-in-attachments">second</a> parts. </li><li>  <a href="http://www.pixelite.co.nz/article/installing-solr-development/">Another manual for installing Apache Solr</a> , an option for development. </li><li>  <a href="https://medium.com/%40e0ipso/restful-drupal-with-search-api-f370050a26bb">Search API integration with RESTful approach</a> . </li></ol></li><li>  Are you studying AngularJS or just planning to do it?  Not sure how to tie it to Drupal?  Check out the article <a href="http://www.sitepoint.com/angularjs-drupal-apps/">AngularJS in Drupal Apps</a> , where you create a block with a list of nodes and search for them, which works absolutely asynchronously. </li><li>  Security issues on sites will always be relevant, especially since the number of utilities that collect vulnerable sites in semi-automatic mode is constantly growing.  Article <a href="https://codedrop.com.au/blog/drupal-security-tips-developers">Drupal Security Tips for Developers</a> helps to move in the right direction. </li><li>  The article <a href="https://www.drupal.org/node/2368709">How to improve security on Drupal sites</a> provides a number of ways to hide the fact that Drupal is being used, so as not to attract the attention of automatic utilities for scanning for vulnerabilities. </li><li>  If you have not heard about the concept of Offline-first, we recommend that you familiarize yourself with the presentation <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/dickolsson/lets-take-drupal-offline-41650712">Let's Take Drupal Offline!</a>  The idea, at least, is curious, although not very applicable at the moment, out of the box. </li><li>  Sometimes you look at the standard forms of editing content in Drupal and you understand: ‚Äúsomething is not right‚Äù.  Yuri Gerasimov <a href="http://wearepropeople.com/blog/drupal-ux-improvements-when-node-forms-are-a-nuisance">has a few ideas</a> on how to significantly improve UX Drupal. </li><li> Do you know about <code>user_multiple_role_edit()</code> ?  A short note on <a href="http://befused.com/drupal/programmatically-assign-roles-users">how to programmatically assign roles to a user</a> is at your service. </li><li>  We continue the coder theme with two curious helper libraries for those who write a lot of code: <a href="http://zengenuity.com/blog/a/201412/decoupling-your-backend-code-drupal-and-improving-your-life-wrappers-delight">Wrappers Delight</a> and <a href="https://github.com/patrickocoffeyo/distill">Distill</a> . </li><li>  Where Drupal is, there is Drush.  The author of the article <a href="http://cheekymonkeymedia.ca/blog/drupal-planet/advanced-drupal-user-management-drush">Advanced Drupal User Management With Drush</a> showed a couple of examples of working with users directly from the console.  For the complete set, the <a href="http://www.drushcommands.com/drush-6x/user/user-login">user-login</a> command is missing. </li><li>  Almost always, when working with different environments, for example: local, aging server, production, one has to deal with the fact that each of them uses either his or her own credentials to connect to the database, as well as a variety of settings, which ultimately leads to the need to have one giant settings.php file or many different ones, for example, settings-prod.php.  Everything is good, but the problem is that each developer‚Äôs local environment may have its own - and this means that even having a local settings file, let's say settings-local.php, everyone will have their own version, which will lead to unnecessary git status changes.  This problem has a solution, and it is covered in the article on <a href="http://www.oliverdavies.co.uk/blog/include-local-drupal-settings-file-environment-configuration-and-overrides">configuration and overrides</a> . </li><li>  If you were wondering how to make your own ‚Äúwidget‚Äù in Panels, we recommend reading the article <a href="http://morpht.com/posts/how-create-ctools-content-types-drupal-7">How to Create Ctools Content Types in the Drupal 7</a> article. </li><li>  In general, Panels is one more thing.  Yuri Gerasimov <a href="http://ygerasimov.com/control-panes-render-sequence">tells in his blog</a> how you can manage the sequence of rendering panels from the admin panel and from the code.  Live and learn! </li><li>  Interested in how to work with multimedia in Drupal?  We have for you an interesting series of articles about the Scald module: <a href="http://www.annertech.com/blog/media-management-drupal-websites">Part 1</a> (review of solutions) and <a href="http://www.annertech.com/blog/drupal-media-management-scald-tutorial">Part 2</a> (introduction to Scald) have already been published. </li><li>  <a href="https://drupalize.me/blog/201412/embed-youtube-videos-media-and-media-internet-sources">A detailed manual on how to make friends with the Media and YouTube module was</a> written by lullabot. </li><li>  We also highly recommend that you read the <a href="https://www.drupal.org/resource-guides/managing-media">Resource Guide: Managing Media in Drupal</a> .  It presents a compilation of the most famous modules and practices on this topic. </li></ul><br><br><h3>  Business and community </h3><br>  Drupal out of code: <br><ul><li>  The results of Drupal-year, very briefly, but very capacious: <a href="https://assoc.drupal.org/blog/jsaylor/six-things-we-learned-about-drupal-2014">Six Things We Learned About Drupal in 2014</a> </li><li>  To speed up the work on Drupal 8 recently created a fund <a href="https://assoc.drupal.org/d8accelerate">Drupal Accelerate Fund</a> in the amount of $ 125,000.  Now any person or organization can apply for a grant if they are ready to organize a sprint to support the core of the system.  Also, Dries and the Drupal Association <a href="http://buytaert.net/announcing-the-drupal-8-accelerate-fund">seek</a> help from organizations that are willing to sponsor this fund in the future.  Set an ambitious goal to collect an additional $ 65,000. </li><li>  The Drupal.org team is actively working to make the main Drupal site convenient for all its users.  To this end, the Drupal association conducted a series of interviews with developers at various levels from beginner to master.  The Russian community was represented by Katya <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/users/kalabro/" class="user_link">Marshalkina</a> aka <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/users/kalabro/" class="user_link">kalabro</a> : <a href="https://assoc.drupal.org/blog/leighc/meeting-personas-drupal-expert">Meeting Personas: The Drupal Expert</a> . </li><li>  There is another division of Drupal developers: Site Builder, Themer and Module Develper.  What is the difference, read the article <a href="http://befused.com/drupal/developer">What is a Drupal developer?</a> </li><li>  Would you like to download for Drupal 8, but there is neither a mentor, nor a suitable project?  Join the initiatives to translate local community sites to Drupal 8: <a href="https://github.com/DrupalRu/drupal.ru/issues/2">drupal.ru</a> and <a href="http://drupal.ua/groups/rozrobka-drupalua/drupalua-perekhodyt-na-drupal-8">drupal.ua,</a> respectively. </li></ul><br><br><h3>  Drupal 8 </h3><br>  News from the front lines of the next version of Drupal: <br><ul><li>  <a href="https://www.drupal.org/node/2394813">Beta4</a> released. </li><li>  <a href="http://hojtsy.hu/blog/2014-dec-12/drupal-8-configuration-schema-cheat-sheet">Cheat sheet on configuration yaml-files</a> , which now stores all the settings of the site. </li><li>  <a href="https://drupalize.me/blog/201412/adventures-porting-d7-form-module-drupal-8">Porting a module from seven to eight</a> using the Drupal Module Upgrader module. </li><li>  As you know, Drupal 8 includes a number of PHP components, probably familiar to web developers from other frameworks, such as Symfony.  Kris Vanderwater provides an overview of the main ones: <br><ul><li>  <a href="https://www.acquia.com/blog/5-php-components-every-drupal-8-developer-should-know-part-1-composer">Composer</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://www.acquia.com/blog/5-php-components-every-drupal-8-developer-should-know-part-2-guzzle">Guzzle</a> </li></ul>  The series will continue. </li><li>  With the development of Drupal 8, <a href="http://buytaert.net/scaling-open-source-communities">not everything is so simple</a> , perhaps due to the fact that the main focus of the system has shifted to moving towards the enterprise world, which naturally led to a complication of the system and raised the bar for contributing.  Interestingly, in this regard, it looks like the fork from Drupal 7 - <a href="http://us7.campaign-archive1.com/%3Fu%3D8a016d204af55747c1fef5769%26amp%3Bid%3D4f76bb26b9">Backdrop CMS</a> .  However, the <a href="https://drupal8release.zensations.at/">majority of respondents</a> are optimistic for 2015. </li></ul><br><br><h3>  Interesting modules </h3><br>  And finally, several modules that are worth paying attention to: <br><br><ul><li>  <a href="https://www.drupal.org/project/termstatus">Taxonomy Term Status</a> allows you to set the status of "published" / "unpublished" for taxonomy terms, just like a node. </li><li>  <a href="https://www.drupal.org/project/dfs">Default file settings</a> for easy management of default file field settings. </li><li>  <a href="https://www.drupal.org/project/classy_panel_styles">Classy Panel Styles</a> for advanced control panel styles ( <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3D5BcD6fVJbYI">videos</a> and <a href="http://slides.com/kendalltotten/classy-panel-styles">slides</a> ). </li><li>  <a href="https://www.drupal.org/project/views_evi">Views EVI (Exposed Value Injector)</a> is a new module that allows you to pass arguments to filters. </li><li>  <a href="https://www.drupal.org/project/reroute_email">Reroute Email is</a> needed to redirect all mail to dev servers ( <a href="http://www.oliverdavies.co.uk/blog/configuring-reroute-email-module">article</a> ). </li><li>  The Drush <a href="https://www.drupal.org/project/registry_rebuild">Registry Rebuild</a> extension will help move the module (even without turning it off) to another folder and not see fatal PHP errors. </li><li>  If you are an active user of the <a href="http://drupal.org/project/panels">Panels</a> module, you‚Äôve probably come across the <a href="https://www.drupal.org/project/fieldable_panels_panes">Fieldable Panels Panes module</a> , which allows you to create entities with an arbitrary set of fields directly when editing the panel, which are literally reusable.  Recently, the <a href="https://www.drupal.org/project/fpp_bundles">Fieldable Panel Panes Bundles</a> module has appeared, which allows you to create bundles, similar to content types. </li><li>  In the <a href="http://codekarate.com/daily-dose-of-drupal/smart-paging-how-display-node-multiple-pages">video review on CodeKarate</a> , the <a href="https://www.drupal.org/project/smart_paging">Smart Paging</a> module is disassembled in detail, which is used to paginate the contents of a node by the number of characters, words or a special placeholder. </li></ul><br><br>  <a href="">Oleg Kot</a> and <a href="">Katya Marshalkina</a> worked on the issue.
