Not familiar until that moment with such a phenomenon as ‚Äúhabraeffekt‚Äù, they could not understand what was happening.  But looking at the statistics of visits, it became clear to them where such an influx of ‚Äútourists‚Äù came from.  As it turned out, in the process of habraeffekt, it‚Äôs not only that many individuals ordered armrests, but also a certain company ordered armrests for their employees (I would like to work in a company that SO cares about its employees). <br><br><img src="http://www.picamatic.com/show/2008/12/21/01/34/1576201_500x315.JPG" alt="image"><br><br>  After talking and discussing some aspects discussed in the article and expressing to each other a dozen compliments, we came to the conclusion that something more could be done ... After some discussion, it was decided that the Russian representative of the company would provide me with a set of armrests for testing. I will write an article - a test drive about their use, independently and whenever possible objectively.  It is clear that in such a situation it is not always easy to maintain impartiality, but I will try not to greatly abuse the trust of the reader.  So, testing ...

    <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  The quality of materials does not cause any complaints.  Metal in appearance is strong and of high quality.  True, I am not a metallurgist to draw serious conclusions about this.  )) But due to a purely personal feeling, the producer did not save on the material.  The plastic of the elbow holder and the leather stretched over it inspire confidence.  An attempt to scratch the skin of the armrest was not successful.  Trifle, but nice!  Still, whatever they say, but a lot depends on the material.  Running a glance over the armrest, I found the emblem of the company, a warning inscription about the maximum load of 10 kg on each of the armrests and the proud inscription ‚ÄúMade in Finland‚Äù.  Surprised!  I forgot when I last held something technologically interesting and that while it was not from China, Taiwan or the Philippines.  )) <br><br><h4>  <b>Day one ‚Äìsetting and first impressions:</b> </h4><br>  I installed the whole set (two armrests and a pad for the mouse).  Mounts are made much smarter than I expected.  From the fastening technology, the meat grinders did not go far, but it was brought to mind.  Only one wheel is movable, which is convenient to grasp with your fingers from any side.  As a result, it makes it possible to attach the armrest for half a minute.  At first glance, the pad for the mouse did not inspire confidence ‚Äî it seemed a little rough, and did not like the fact that the fabric part of the pad was not glued to the plastic base.  She gets it without much effort, so I thought that she would move with strong movements.  Later, it turned out that I was mistaken - despite the fact that it was not fastened tightly, the rug was sitting tightly, not jumping out of its shackles. <br><br>  When I looked at the samples in the internet, I thought that the pad would be of no use to me and that I would send it in the forest if given as a gift.  On the first day I decided to leave it so that I could compare it later.  At the bottom of the pad are two holes for mounting to the armrest.  One close to the rear edge, the second closer to the center.  Attached first to the central - absolutely not convenient, the arm has to be pushed back, which requires additional gestures.  I moved it to an extreme mount and the situation has changed dramatically.  Everything is in its place and now does not distract from work.  Since there are no threads on the pad / armrest connection, it can be tweaked to the left or right.  After installation, the rug is at a height of about 3 centimeters above the table.  A bit unusual and funny, but does not affect the functionality. <br><br> <a href="http://www.picamatic.com/view/1576207_IMG_7810/"><img src="http://www.picamatic.com/show/2008/12/21/01/35/1576207_bigthumb.JPG" alt="IMG_7810.JPG - upload images with Picamatic" title="IMG_7810.JPG" width="187" height="240"></a> <br><br>  As it immediately became less free space behind the workplace.  It is bad-used to breathe freely and you can move without constraint.  I like to sit at the computer, lifting his foot on a chair.  The armrests partially impede me in this.  I found a solution - move the chair a little further than usual, and you can lift your legs as much as you like. <br><br>  After half an hour of work, I felt that my back was somehow not feeling that way.  He came to the conclusion that because of the elevation of the armrests, they force him to sit more evenly.  I didn‚Äôt expect what I didn‚Äôt expect, can I correct my posture at the same time?  The truth is that it is not easy to use it, I feel that my back is in an unusual position, therefore I am partly tense. <br><br>  Having read the latest news on Habr√©, I didn‚Äôt even notice how my left elbow settled on the armrest crib with its tip, thus supporting a heavy head.  Still, what the human body is interestingly arranged for, he chooses for himself a comfortable position, using for this purpose all available objects. <br><br>  <b>Day four:</b> <br>  Working with armrests has become more natural and does not cause much effort in the process of use.  Getting used to the face.  Today I played a little with the height of the armrests - let them go by a centimeter.  Judging by the first sensations, it became more comfortable.  But I will make a conclusion later.  The back got used to the new mode of operation and position.  I can definitely say that the load on her has dropped several times.  I can not say that I have ever suffered from severe back pain, but sometimes you can feel overworked and tired in the back from sitting at a computer for a long time, and your neck is numb.  So this feeling of fatigue in the back is gone.  About the neck is not clear. <br><br> <a href="http://www.picamatic.com/view/1576208_IMG_7827/"><img src="http://www.picamatic.com/show/2008/12/21/01/35/1576208_bigthumb.JPG" alt="IMG_7827.JPG - Picamatic - upload your images" title="IMG_7827.JPG" width="320" height="220"></a> <br><br>  However, today I noticed a flaw in the use of these armrests.  My workplace is not only a laptop with a mouse in addition, it is also a dozen wires connecting it with all sorts of peripherals, starting with external hard drives with a DVD-drive and ending with a hub with a fork in several directions.  Since I like to shuffle a laptop around the room (in bed to read, to watch a film lying down), I have to move it, and with it the connected wires.  So the movement has become less mobile with the advent of armrests.  Wires during transfer cling to them, so the process takes more time. <br><br>  He spoke with his father, he is my programmer with 15 years of experience.  Told him about the armrests that I was testing.  Immediately followed by a proposal to ship one of the two to the parental home.  ))) While I refused him.  But it prompted me to test work with one armrest. <br><br><h4>  Day Six ‚ÄìWork with one armrest: </h4><br>  Today I forced myself to unscrew the left armrest and stay with one.  I am not happy with such a turn of events.  Even more not happy about the changes in my body.  Hints to me that he is uncomfortable.  I feel that something is missing, somehow everything is skewed.  It affects addiction to good.  Probably should start a test drive with one armrest and then gradually move on to two.  It seems to me, then the impressions would have been a bit different. <br><br>  <b>Day nine:</b> <br>  I still continue to torture myself with one armrest.  I thought I would get used to it in a couple of days, but this did not happen.  The back and neck began to tire again.  So much so that sometimes I just turn the armrest to the side and work without it.  I want to return the second ‚Äúiron hand‚Äù, but for now I‚Äôll restrain myself.  I'll give you a chance to justify yourself to a lonely armrest, but this time without a mouse stand.  Right now I will unscrew it ... <br><br>  <b>Day eleven:</b> <br>  "One-armed bandit" ... So I want to call him affectionately.  )) In fact, it does not harm at all and does not prevent me from working.  Quite the contrary!  Swinging the "mouse nest", I pushed the mount a little further away from me.  Thus, on the table it became a little more spacious, at least visually.  But now, when the armrest is not used, it can be pushed over the edge of the table.  After all, he has three moving parts.  One at the base of the mount, the second at the junction of two metal parts and the third under the forged holder itself, so that it can be turned in all directions. <br><br> <a href="http://www.picamatic.com/view/1576214_IMG_7809/"><img src="http://www.picamatic.com/show/2008/12/21/01/36/1576214_bigthumb.JPG" alt="IMG_7809.JPG - image uploaded to Picamatic" title="IMG_7809.JPG" width="320" height="203"></a> <br><br>  <b>Day Thirteen:</b> <br>  A lone armrest is still adjacent to me at the desk.  Everything is quite comfortable, and most importantly comfortable.  We no longer interfere with each other, but rather support.  More precisely, he supports me and performs his task with full responsibility.  I managed to adapt to the new state of affairs and the armrest harmoniously fit into the symphony of the workplace.  The neck is still tired from prolonged and improper sitting.  Although I understand that the toaster is not the same as a microwave, and that the armrests should help the hands, not the neck ... But in my heart the memory of two iron brothers, with whom it was so comfortable ... <br><br>
<h4>  Day Sixteen - Summing Up: </h4><br>  After yesterday's filming of a video review of the armrests, I finally screwed the second iron friend to my desk.  I can not rejoice in sensations.  The process of working with a laptop again became a pleasant thing, and my back and neck thank me for taking care of them.  I don‚Äôt know what is written in the instructions, as I haven‚Äôt seen it in my eyes.  But on my own feeling, I can confidently say that the armrests contribute to the rest of the neck and back.  In addition, they have a positive effect on posture.  True, a lot here also depends on the chair / chair behind which you sit. <br><br>  <b>According to the results of the test drive, I can draw the following conclusions ...</b> <br>  One armrest creates comfort, but can not replace a complete set.  Since it does not carry in itself all those delicious "buns" that are felt in the full set.  As it seems to me, about buying one armrest, the lion's share of their usefulness and purpose is lost.  Perhaps this will be an acceptable option for people with carpal tunnel syndrome, as this is one of their main uses.  But since I do not suffer from this syndrome, I cannot judge this parameter. <br><br> <a href="http://www.picamatic.com/view/1576199_IMG_7798/"><img src="http://www.picamatic.com/show/2008/12/21/01/34/1576199_bigthumb.JPG" alt="IMG_7798.JPG - Picamatic - upload your images" title="IMG_7798.JPG" width="320" height="234"></a> <br><br>  A complete set of armrests not only creates the convenience of working at a computer, but also has a positive effect on the health of those who have been behind it for a long time.  Including on the health of the back and neck. <br><br>  After a personal acquaintance with the armrests, I can confidently say that they carry no less benefit than a comfortable computer chair.  The back and neck make it very clear.  Nice design will allow iron assistants to easily fit into the working environment of any geek.  True, provided that you do not stick in front of a bunch of wires. <br><br>  Black color seemed to me the most optimal for aesthetic satisfaction, since other colors are a little striking against the background of other computer equipment. <br>  On the pad, when I met, I sinned in vain.  After prolonged use, I came to the conclusion that the surface area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe pad is large enough for convenient mouse control.  It seemed to me that it is more standard rugs.  The coating material is pleasant to the touch and the mouse behaves on it naturally and without response delays. <br><br>  A detailed video review will be published a little later.  The material is filmed but requires careful handling and installation. <br><br>  <i>Thanks to the Russian representative office of <a href="http://ergorest.ru/">Ergorest</a> for providing a set of armrests for review!</i> <br><br>  Original article on <a href="http://nasladis.net/news/2008-12-21-128">"Enjoy.net"</a> . <br><br>  <b>UPD:</b> In order to avoid misunderstandings, I emphasized in the review that although this mounting technology is similar to the fastening of the meat grinder, it is brought to mind.  But judging by the comments, this point requires a more detailed explanation.  Therefore, let me note the following: <br><br>  First, the diameter of the mounting surface is several times larger than the mounting diameter of the meat grinder. <br>  Secondly, the mount is made not of metal, but of plastic.  As a result, the load distribution over the table surface is more correct. <br><br>  <b>UPD2:</b> Finally, a bit of free time appeared, and after almost a month and a half, I took up the installation.  I apologize for being late, but I have not had an opportunity before.  I see no reason to open a new topic for a video review, it is better to put everything in one place.  Well, okay, rant, present to your attention a video review of the armrests. <br><br><video>  http://rutube.ru/tracks/1472318.html?v=a310c2dec1d24eefc927f2c4f41af318 </video></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/47421/">https://habr.com/ru/post/47421/</a></p>
