  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Bug or fieldset feature?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Do you know, dear readers, about such a wonderful and, I would say, cool <strong>fieldset</strong> tag?  I think of course you know!  And how often do you use it?  I think very rarely.  Well, okay, okay, persuaded - it was you, dear, that you use it quite often, but the coder Vasya from a neighboring company - surely rarely, and maybe only once ‚Äútasted it‚Äù when he learned about it.  Well, okay, not about this.  If you have used it often, you may have come across an unusual <strong>fieldset</strong> behavior, namely, ignoring the <strong>width</strong> , if the nested element is wider and no <strong>overflow</strong> can help the cause.  Immediately give <a href="http://demo.g63.ru/fieldset/fieldset_demo_01.html" title="Bug or fieldset feature? Example 1. Restriction of a fieldset in width.">an example</a> .  This and subsequent examples look in current versions of FF (32) and Chrome (35);  IE11, oddly enough, showed its best and worked correctly;  I did not check the other browsers. <br><br>  Attention!  In the article, all the examples are simplified to the maximum - to one nested element! <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Well, now let's go back a little bit.  It happens often in life that we need to hide unnecessary elements that did not fit into the block allotted to them, for example, to make a carousel.  Everything is clear: <br><ol><li>  Assign the block a specified width / height and <strong>overflow hidden</strong> or <strong>scroll</strong> </li><li>  Inside, if this is the case with the carousel, set the width / height with a margin. </li><li>  Profit </li></ol><br>  It seems nothing complicated.  <a href="http://demo.g63.ru/fieldset/fieldset_demo_02.html" title="Bug or fieldset feature? Example 2. The restriction of the div width and height.">An example</a> . <br><br>  But then there was a situation that we needed a form and the diseased brain decided to use a <strong>fieldset</strong> to group the elements.  Well, not a sick brain, but on the contrary - healthy, because it is semantic and cool, everything is like in adults.  We try to do the same as usual. 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>
        <script>
          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      First <a href="http://demo.g63.ru/fieldset/fieldset_demo_03.html" title="Bug or fieldset feature? Example 3. The height of the fieldset.">an example with height restriction</a> .  Everything works as it should in height.  You can put <strong>scroll</strong> or just <strong>hidden</strong> , if we want to work out the scrolling on JS, the result makes us happy. <br><br>  But at the same time, it immediately catches the eye that the <strong>fieldset is</strong> 100% wide and causes a little bewilderment.  I think everyone will immediately exclaim: "So ask him the width!" Well, let's <a href="http://demo.g63.ru/fieldset/fieldset_demo_01.html" title="Bug or fieldset feature? Example 1. Restriction of a fieldset in width.">set this width</a> !  What do we see? .. About omnipresent html take you, what kind of Hindu beetle?  <strong>Fieldset</strong> shrank, but to the size of the elements enclosed in it.  This is an incomprehensible feature of the <strong>fieldset</strong> , or a bug, or a feature. <br><br>  Of course, there is a <a href="http://demo.g63.ru/fieldset/fieldset_demo_04.html" title="Bug or fieldset feature? Example 1. Simple solution">simple solution</a> - to wrap the insides in one more block and to put an <strong>overflow</strong> and a fixed width for it. <br><br>  I tried to look for a solution to the problem, but Google doesn‚Äôt say anything cheerful, just a long dialogue on <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi%3Fid%3D261037" title="Bug 261037 - overflow property not implemented on fieldset">bugzilla.mozilla.org</a> , but there I didn‚Äôt find a discussion of this particular problem.  <a href="http://dev.w3.org/html5/spec-preview/the-fieldset-element.html" title="4.10.4 The fieldset element">The specification</a> on this subject also does not tell anything intelligible.  Or I did not find, in view of the poor knowledge of the English language. <br><br>  The specification shows that the <strong>fieldset</strong> refers to: <br><ul><li>  <a href="http://dev.w3.org/html5/spec-preview/content-models.html" title="flow content">flow content</a> , that is, it does not tell us about any features and does not distinguish it from, for example, beloved by all, <strong>div</strong> . </li><li>  <a href="http://dev.w3.org/html5/spec-preview/headings-and-sections.html" title="sectioning root">sectioning root</a> , which means some distinctive styles that are not inherited by descendants, for example, the border for TD and our hero's <strong>fieldset</strong> , and some others of their own.  This does not give us anything either, and <a href="http://demo.g63.ru/fieldset/fieldset_demo_05.html" title="Bug or fieldset feature? Example 5. Error checking on blockquote.">you can check</a> on the ‚Äúneighboring‚Äù element of <strong>blockquote</strong> </li><li>  <a href="http://dev.w3.org/html5/spec-preview/forms.html" title="Listed elements">Listed elements</a> and <a href="http://dev.w3.org/html5/spec-preview/forms.html" title="form-associated elements">form-associated elements</a> are elements that can / must have a parent <strong>form</strong> .  Here, too, <a href="http://demo.g63.ru/fieldset/fieldset_demo_06.html" title="Bug or fieldset feature? Example 6. Button error checking.">you can check</a> on the "next element", for example <strong>button</strong> .  About the result, I think you guessed it. </li><li>  <a href="http://dev.w3.org/html5/spec-preview/content-models.html" title="Listed elements">Palpable content</a> - this tells us that this element must be filled.  This is not a prerequisite, since this element can be prepared empty for subsequent filling with children, but it is recommended not to leave it empty.  There are a lot of such elements, so this is also not the case. </li></ul><br><br>  Next comes the standard attribute description and a couple of examples. <br><br>  If they did not help me, we will try to figure it out for ourselves. <br><br>  Everything turned out to be simple for Chrome.  He has a vendor <strong>min-width: -webkit-min-content</strong> sewn into it, which hints and says a lot, even if he doesn‚Äôt know, just translate words.  It was easy to find out through the built-in "Developer Tools".  Therefore, this problem is solved simply, for this it is enough to set the <strong>min-width</strong> equal to the <strong>width</strong> . <br><br>  But for FF, this method did not help.  And here the well-known spear method was called to help.  The first thing that comes to mind is to set <strong>display: block</strong> .  This thought probably visited you more than once from the very beginning of the article?  However, neither <strong>block</strong> , nor <strong>inline</strong> , nor even the <strong>table</strong> is suitable.  However, the train of thought is correct.  Using the search of various modes were found several, not clear way, working.  These are the modes <strong>table-cell</strong> or <strong>table-column</strong> .  It is also possible options <strong>table-column-group</strong> , <strong>table-footer-group</strong> or <strong>table-header-group</strong> , but this is too much.  What does it have to do with the table cell mode in general?  However, I think this is a hack for FF and I would like to find a more reasonable and correct solution. <br><br>  <a href="http://demo.g63.ru/fieldset/fieldset_demo_07.html" title="Bug or fieldset feature? Example 7. Solving the problem with fieldset">Solving the problem with fieldset</a> <br><br>  Maybe there are experts who solved this problem by other methods or are more familiar with the specification and tell you what's what?  Or is it worth writing to both browsers? <br><br>  <a href="http://jsfiddle.net/BaNru/sa7sg4ks/2/" title="width overflow in fieldset">Link to jsfiddle with examples</a> for play. <br><br>  I think that's all, now you can start throwing slippers.  Thanks for attention. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/239467/">https://habr.com/ru/post/239467/</a></p>
