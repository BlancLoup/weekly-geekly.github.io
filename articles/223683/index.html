Now free!</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Friends, we are happy to share with you the good news - the official launch of the Appintop automated application promotion service took place!  In addition, we have prepared for you a great gift, which took several months of hard work.  This is the SPY Market Analytics Module, which is available absolutely free!  Subscription to such services costs about $ 10,000 per month. <br><br>  <b>The SPY module allows you to:</b> <br>  - view how much earn the top 400 applications in 25 countries; <br>  - spy on competitors (revenue and installation); <br>  - select a niche for the application; <br>  - find out how many installations are needed to reach any position in any region; <br>  - find out how much you will earn at a certain position; <br>  - select countries for promotion; <br>  - look for objects for investment; <br>  - and much more. <br><br>  <b>How do we collect data?</b>

      Access to the SPY module is free, but with one condition: in return, you need to provide iTunes connect your application.  This allows us to make analytics even more accurate.  The system has already more than 5,000 iTunes connect'ov applications that give us their data on the settings and earnings.  Most analytical services work in the same way, and only we provide all analytical data absolutely free of charge! <br><br>  By connecting your iTunes connect, you get access to a convenient analytics system for the 25 largest countries and for the TOP-400 positions for each of them: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/cd0/aef/a37/cd0aefa378e12340f5b98c3d17c30505.png" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>How the SPY module was created</b> <br><br>  Creating such a module was a very difficult task both from the technical side and from getting iTunes connects.  Several large analytical companies, having gathered a decent pool of applications, became monopolists in the market of mobile analytics.  But we believed that it was possible to create a technically more advanced service, and most importantly, make it free!  Developers do not have to pay for analytics, especially at $ 10,000 per month. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The team clearly understood that the module would not be the goal of making money, but the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãcreating a truly useful service for mobile developers was very motivating.  The collection of the first iTunes connect'ov passed rather slowly.  This is quite logical - the developers did not want to share information about their application.  But some of them believed in our idea.  The more iTunes connect'ov we collected, the easier it was to get the following. <br><br>  Now the SPY module works on the principle of combing.  That is, if we know how much the 1st, 3rd and 5th applications earn and how many installations it receives, then we can safely predict these parameters for the 2nd and 4th applications.  We take common positions from TOP overall of different countries. <br><br>  <b>SPY module helps to choose a niche for the application</b> <br><br>  Among novice developers, there is a perception that the most promising area is mobile games, because they bring the lion‚Äôs share of revenues.  Therefore, many young developers are striving specifically for the gaming sector, trying to create another free-to-play hit and hit the big jackpot.  But the degree of saturation in the mobile games industry is very high, the competition rolls over, and it is extremely difficult for newcomers to break through. <br><br>  The SPY module will help you choose the best niche for development.  You have the opportunity to see how many applications earn in different categories and countries.  For example, the following shows how many applications of the category "Business" in the United States earn: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/390/d65/3e2/390d653e2d9983b358d2a9b586d0de99.png" alt="image"><br><br><blockquote>  <b>‚ÄúWe would give a lot for such a service 2 years ago when we conquered the markets of Asia‚Äù</b> </blockquote><br><br>  Two years ago, with our own application, we decided to enter the Asian markets, we chose two countries - Vietnam and Thailand.  We were attracted by the complete lack of competition, a huge number of users and other components of success. <br><br>  We began with a detailed study of the local audience, its mentality and other features.  The next step was the localization and adaptation of the application.  Almost immediately we reached TOP overall.  We firmly held the first position for several weeks.  But the problem was that even top applications in these countries earn a measly $ 100-200 per day.  This is a penny compared to how much we spent on development, localization and promotion. <br><br><br>  But the data on the revenue of the highest-grossing casino games in the USA: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c7d/555/ef5/c7d555ef5e567f68b46d4fcd6d675eb5.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Agree, these figures can not fail to impress! <br><br>  You can get full access to the SPY module by going to appintop.com and connecting your iTunes connect.  The more applications in the system, the more accurate information it gives! <br><br>  <b>Register on <a href="https://appintop.com/">Appintop.com</a></b> and get free access to the SPY module and many other service features. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/223683/">https://habr.com/ru/post/223683/</a></p>
