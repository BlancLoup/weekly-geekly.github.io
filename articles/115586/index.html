      I will tell about reports, speakers and a meeting as a whole under a cat. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  We should start with the fact that we changed the venue of the meeting.  If the first two were held at Ingria, then the third was decided to be held at the St. Petersburg State University of Technology and Technological Innovation Research Center.  M.A.  Bonch-Bruevich. <br><br>  The change of venue has obvious advantages.  Firstly, this is a great opportunity to introduce students from one of the best universities of St. Petersburg to our meetings, and, secondly, in order to unequivocally state that the venue is perfect, you need to compare it with something.  After analyzing the feedback received from the feedback we will decide where to hold the next meeting. <br><br>  I would like to once again apologize for the quality of sound in the video, there were unforeseen technical difficulties: ( <br><br>  Well, let's go directly to the meeting.  The first with his presentation was <b>Stanislav Krasnoyarov</b> , the head of the development team with 10 years of experience.  Stanislav told about opensource framework for creating 2D games - ‚Äú <a href="http://www.cocos2d.org/">Cocos2D</a> ‚Äù. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b4c/f09/3c5/b4cf093c51c3a44c35ec2ee86a42d860.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Without becoming a torment to those present in the theoretical part, Stanislav sat down at his MacBook and showed how easy and cool it is to use <b>Cocos2d</b> .  All those present online watched as an airplane in a vacuum learns how to fly, turn and shoot against the background of clouds. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/P9o-D7PHt0I%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700002,15700019,15700186,15700190,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhgDNN0T8mW3aaCF-qqjKQytjy8QCw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  Despite the tricks of the dark forces (how else can you explain the Tab key that has fallen off in the process?), After some half an hour, using its special magic called <b>Cocos2d</b> , a war was ready with two militant planes trying to destroy each other. <br><br>  <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/AntonKrokhmalyuk/cocos2d-7267792">Presentation of Stanislav Krasnoyarov about Cocos2d.</a> <br><br>  The next speaker was <b>Andrei Baskov</b> , who created <a href="http://www.inrs.ru/">InResearch</a> in the field of online research, and now is fully engaged in the creation of the mobile geolocation game <a href="http://geopo.ly/">Geopoly</a> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b93/496/530/b934965308c64e6ebdc8ed0d5c876b6d.jpg" alt="image">  . <br><br>  All those present would be happy to hear about the development of the game <b>Geopoly itself</b> , but according to the creator, it is not yet ready.  Nevertheless, Andrew spoke about the <a href="http://monotouch.net/">Monotouch</a> compiler, which allows you to use C # to develop applications for the iPhone. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/XcXdhjmGkY4%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700002,15700019,15700186,15700190,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhjK8DMAflgLy9n-K1Sc8bMVsdGskw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  In a small discussion after the presentation, everyone agreed that <b>Monotouch is</b> certainly good, but it is advisable to use it to solve certain problems.  For example, a person who knows C # well will get to <b>know Monotach</b> much faster than understanding <b>Objective-C</b> from scratch. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/330/ed7/08a/330ed708a1aa493498f25de98a59cf09.gif" alt="drupal hit counter"><br><br>  Andrew did not hide the disadvantages of <b>Monotouch</b> .  The problem with licensing stands apart.  A personal license costs $ 399.  There is a free version in which you can not run applications on the device, and a version for students at a price of $ 99, in which there is no possibility of sending the application in the AppStore. <br><br>  <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/AntonKrokhmalyuk/monotouch">Presentation by Andrey Baskov about Monotouch.</a> <br><br>  After a small stake-break (yes-yes, exactly a <b>stake-</b> break), it's time to share the experience of an expert in mobile application development at <a href="http://www.dataart.ru/">DataArt</a> <b>Gregory Buteyko</b> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/448/e53/3eb/448e533eb97251b434d3b9d2ad93f830.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Grigory talked about creating high-quality shadows using <a href="http://unity3d.com/">Unity3D</a> .  Grisha initially wanted to talk exclusively about shadows, but closer to the meeting he decided to expand his presentation a bit and told us about the multiplatform game development tool - <b>Unity3D</b> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/5e5/18b/5e5/5e518b5e5c3e498299b2b1f6cafc950e.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Among the advantages of using <b>Unity,</b> Gregory highlighted the presence of a free version for Windows and JavaScript code.  There is also a physics engine, but it can be attributed to the advantages with a big stretch, since it is very important and you will have to pay for the iPhone version.  On the example of the finished game, Gregory demonstrated how much easier it is to create an animation of a dangling ribbon on a ship in 3d, compared to 2d. <br><br>  Returning to the shadows, Gregory said that in <b>Unity3D the</b> shadow must be drawn initially without external playing space on a white screen, without using the dimming function.  Not to be unfounded, Grisha showed how the shadow of one of the ships is arranged, and showed how steep it is in movement due to the use of <b>Unity</b> .  So that everyone could clearly see the shadows of objects, I had to create a small sex in the audience :) <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/eEZIey7RhnA%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700002,15700019,15700186,15700190,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhhvZiKRfC8pU4rLMMPFtu_0B2z-Ng" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  In conclusion, I would like to say that we are growing and developing.  Both beginner students and experienced programmers join us.  We will be happy to see new developers at the next meetings. <br><br>  The <b>ADC # 4</b> meeting will be held in early April and we are still thinking about its subject matter.  We will be glad to hear your suggestions! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/115586/">https://habr.com/ru/post/115586/</a></p>
