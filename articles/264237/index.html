And I continue to persecute the stories of our team of field engineers.  A part happened to me, some colleagues shared a part - they were not personally present everywhere, that's why it was ‚Äústories‚Äù.  Plus, of course, the details are slightly modified, so as not to offend anyone.  If you suddenly recognize yourself - remember that at the same time ten more different people are thinking about their company. <br><br>  Let's start.  <b>In a large company, we did video surveillance at one of the sites.</b>  There are two security services - IT and "physics".  The first "put the cable," the second "lay face to the floor."  So, at the insistence of IT security officers, we did a separate network on the coax so that it was impossible to unscrew the camera, stick into its place and pull the router.  Tormented pretty.  At the end of the installation, we paid attention to a number of ‚Äúphysicist‚Äù sensors located right next to the cameras.  On a twisted pair.  Twisted one, stuck with a laptop, there is a web interface of the router ... and yes, the password is 12345678!

      <b>Once we raised a call center for that part of the bank, which, as it turned out, is collecting debts.</b>  The engineer‚Äôs impressions of acceptance are absolutely amazing: <br>  ‚ÄúYou know, a flock of such cute girls before the shift.‚Äù  Affectionate, flirt, eyes are building.  And then they sit on the automated workplace and begin to talk so brutally with clients that it becomes scary.  I almost moved down the wall there for the first time. <br>  Having stayed on test operation for 3 days, the engineer made a willful decision and closed all his credit cards. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  <b>One of my first trips fell on the introduction of telecom equipment in one of the banks.</b>  While still an inexperienced engineer, I sat quietly in the corner reading the manuals, configuring the server, and at that time someone had updated the network configs on Friday night, and the whole region fell.  I saw such a panic for the first time: there was a feeling that I was in a fire, and, frankly, it was only reassuring that the problem was not related to my iron at all.  Perhaps this was the last time I experienced such an unusual feeling.  There was nothing much to help - the admins were experienced, and the manual was walking right behind my back ... But after a couple of hours I started to strain, because no one wanted to accept the job until the network was up.  Fortunately, I got out of there for the weekend. <br><br>  <b>Somehow there was a "blind installation" - without electricity.</b>  I arrived on an urgent call to the clock by 5 pm, and there the electrician fastens the first socket, the network cable hangs from the stream not compressed.  The electrician got ready and left in 15 minutes, his working day was over.  I was left alone and not one more IT specialist or engineer in the office.  I collected everything without checking.  Fortunately, when food was served, it started the first time.  One more time they collected electricity without electricity in a similar situation.  Only the iron was well prepared - but it so happened that the electricians failed and did everything almost two hours before the start of the event. <br><br>  <b>At a factory in one of the cities in the center of Russia, a conference room is needed, because a deputy will arrive at the site, and it is very necessary.</b>  And the hall is not there.  And never was.  And he is desperately needed, and needed tomorrow.  Whatever.  Call us.  The customer offers to disassemble your from the office, to transport there and connect.  Well, we come - and there half the equipment is deep inside the walls.  They collected something from him, something from us.  I remember switching pieces were removed even in a bar near the office.  We finished gathering at 17, we arrive at the facility at 23 with iron.  And there are not even chairs, only two sockets.  Switching at some moments was twisted from a twisted pair, simply connecting for some reason.  While they were collecting, another surprise - one of the very necessary complex cameras burnt down.  Without it in any way.  At this plant, an electrician was urgently found who repaired units more than himself for the rest of his life.  They showed him a camera, they said that nobody would fix it.  The electrician on the words "impossible" and "no one" woke up, felt professional excitement, called us suckers and went to pick the device.  He returned, said that there was an extra charge, he threw it out and sealed it all with wire.  Check out the suckers.  Turn on - works.  There are no functions, but it works, and that's enough for us.  At seven in the morning they finished, just at that moment the furniture makers arrived, they began to arrange.  And by the end of breakfast, we were told that no one would come, the deputy canceled the meeting. <br><br>  <b>They did a project near Vladivostok.</b>  Dobiralovo round-trip strictly ferry.  The builders of the buildings did not quite have time, so our workplaces were now on the covers of gas cylinders, now in normal conditions - but with a perforator exactly above the head.  The neighbor-woodpecker in such cases seems like a nice and pleasant person. <br><br>  <b>In another region, we worked with people who did not adhere to the project management methodology at all.</b>  On short things like a month or two, it still rolled, but on long ones it didn‚Äôt.  Both the customer and the contractor didn‚Äôt understand what planning, debugging and trial operation were.  For them, he came, he did, he said that everything is OK - it means that he did the work.  The contractors were especially offended when we checked everything - they did it already!  They simply hated the checklists.  They looked at the paper and said: this is the wrong document, does not fit.  And thrown out. <br><br>  In another big project there were very complex communications that eventually turned out to be friendly and business-like.  The problem was in the army's approach to planning: we dig from here to the result.  Dates are not laid at all, iterations, sprints, stages - all on the fly.  As a result, we sent free of charge several specialists of the customer to courses on methodology.  The customer was inspired by the principles of proper planning. <br><br>  <b>Very often, before the pain in the teeth is the wrong description of the initial situations.</b>  For example, there is a task - to equip an object with workplaces.  One of two hundred in the country.  No details, the customer says: "Come, do it, you will understand, they are waiting for you already."  We come.  The building has no outlets at all. <br><br>  <b>We did for some large company a new contact center.</b>  This is not the first KC that we raised with them (the company is really large), so the work went smoothly.  Among other things, there was such a moment - it was necessary to roll all the settings from the KC from the neighboring region.  In particular, copied the music that is played when the client is in a queue on hold.  The file, of course, was taken from that KC, and the customer himself flooded it there in due time.  Acceptance, change, everything is fine.  A month goes by and a ticket with an intriguing headline "Contact Center offers phone sex" falls to our second line of support.  It turned out that at a certain minute of music played for internal calls of employees, quotations from films begin, from which, in fact, the sound series.  And there was a phrase from a comedy where a guy glues a girl.  Called the girl from the accounting, which for a long time connected with someone.  She departed for a couple of seconds, and then returned and hears something like the following: <br>  - You are not interested in sex with an unfamiliar man? <br>  This file was used for a long time, and no one knew.  Changed, of course. <br><br>  <b>One strange person called the client CC of the bank.</b>  Perhaps unbalanced.  He chose the intervals when dialing was done immediately (from about an hour to four in the morning) and began to ask in detail and meticulously about various services.  This is if the girl took the phone.  If the guy - immediately instead of greeting the flow of inventive mat.  I called only 8-800 for a long time.  It is impossible to block - it means to limit the client‚Äôs access to services, it‚Äôs simply illegal.  And the operator can not interrupt the call, be sure to say goodbye.  Perhaps our old friend is calling now. <br><br>  <b>One of the customers has a contact center at two sites in Novocherkassk and Chelyabinsk.</b>  Night work, the software suddenly became very slow at certain times.  We understand, find out the causes of delays.  Michael, a techie from the customer, sat in Novocherkassk with us.  At the same time, I had parallel work at night in another city, so I also barely slept for several days.  In the morning, after a long, long night, Misha calls me and says so hesitantly: <br>  - A meteorite fell on Chelyabinsk, and we do not ping them.  Cellular in their inaccessible and on the city can not get through.  Probably this is the problem. <br>  The condition is very familiar for a three-day lack of sleep.  As calmly as possible, trying not to offend Misha, I say: <br>  - Misha, do not worry.  We will repair everything, we will repair the program, we will repair the meteorite, the main thing is not to worry, you need to rest. <br>  Misha calmed down and went to sleep.  And I started reading the news.  And it turned out that the meteorite was real, Misha is right.  Then I contacted the engineers of our Moscow office and explained: <br>  - Found a problem.  In Chelyabinsk, a meteorite fell, it's in it. <br>  - Eeee ... You are this, do not worry so.  Get some sleep, we'll fix everything, we'll figure it out. <br><br>  <b>One manufacturer has been selling a new supercool software and hardware complex in the USA for a couple of months.</b>  There were no such people in Russia, it was necessary to make up and learn.  It must be said that the advertisement was not just aggressive, but very loud - they say that only eggs are cooler.  Iron is worth waiting for a representative of the manufacturer at their own point, so that he filled the software.  He starts to set - does not work.  Starts again, does not rise.  Takes another image, puts - does not work, even burst.  Then our bomber entered the fourth round, but the target was not hit.  We have already begun to worry about the pilot's psyche.  But no, he scratched his head, said, ‚ÄúI'll be back‚Äù and left for 2 weeks.  Then he called on the reserve site to show - only there it rose. <br><br>  <b>An interesting project was in the medical center.</b>  There, we installed telemedicine for telemedicine in the operational videoconferencing system (videoconferencing), so that students had a place to study right in practice, plus doctors could remotely advise in difficult cases.  Engineers are accustomed to working in data centers and business centers.  And on the spot the finale was made right during the operation, when it was necessary to raise the first link to those students.  The work consisted in the transfer of the entire operation in as much detail as possible - it was necessary to arrange the chambers so that the doctor would not interfere and the students would see what was needed.  Plus, check the lighting, the doctors were very worried about the different color of blood, it is critically important to them.  Engineers sterilized, dressed in ‚Äúsuits‚Äù explained where to climb is not necessary, read TB.  And then they rolled up the patient and started cutting.  Not everyone survived, because the process is long and not very pleasant.  At the same time, the anesthesiologist perfectly complemented the picture, to whom in the middle of the operation there were few cases.  He helped the plot, predicting climaxes.  ‚ÄúMove the camera here!  Here it will be interesting now ... Look, look ... Where did you run to?  Okay, guys, let's get another one with the camera ... then you, come here, take it off - it's splashing now! ‚Äù  Then there were other projects in telemedicine - at the dental one, for example.  But we remembered that anesthesiologist for a long time. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/264237/">https://habr.com/ru/post/264237/</a></p>
