  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Why go to IT conferences, even if you are not an IT person?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  This autumn, <a href="http://ichar.ru/">for the</a> first time, <a href="http://ichar.ru/">iChar</a> employees visited one of the most important IT events in Russia - the ISDEF 2015 conference. The Year is organized <a href="http://isdef.org/ru/news/">by the ISDEF</a> (Independent Software Developers Forum), an <a href="http://isdef.org/ru/news/">association of independent developers</a> founded in 2002.  This is a non-profit organization designed to represent and protect the interests of developers.  The conference helps to stay informed, improve the development and implementation of software, make it better, and business more successfully.  In addition, at the event, participants can always get new and reliable information about the market and find partners. <br><br>  In addition, last Saturday, our leading IT recruiter, Victoria Sedova, made a presentation in the IT HR section at <a href="http://piter-united.ru/itgm/itgm.html">IT Global Meetup</a> - the favorite crowd of all IT people in St. Petersburg, which takes place three times a year.  iChar came to the mitap, it can be said, in full force - and we enjoyed it a lot. <br><br>  Do you know what we think?  It is interesting not only for developers to go to IT events.  IT conferences, meetings, meetings and festivals will be of interest to anyone who is in any way in contact with IT, and here's why.

Be in context </h2><br>  If you read Megamind, your work is probably related to IT and you follow the industry news.  Conferences are a simple and pleasant way to learn about the latest market innovations, the best practices of colleagues, foreign practices.  IT conferences are a reliable source of information about what the industry lives and what it discusses.  Such events are always a source of inspiration that charges with drive and new ideas.  Want to get food for thought and learn new things?  Welcome! <br><br><h2>  2. Make useful contacts </h2><br>  People go to the conference not only for new knowledge and ideas.  Here you want - you do not want, and you meet someone, and acquaintance will certainly be useful.  Professionals from different cities gather at industry conferences and create a favorable environment for networking, thanks in large part to the special atmosphere - friendly and at the same time active.  IT is a dynamic, cohesive and vibrant community, moreover, friendly to beginners.  IT events give a chance to integrate into the life of a community, feel like a part of a global and interesting process and get real pleasure from it. <br><br>  Communication at an IT conference will certainly be productive - in professional, business or personal terms.  Want to find partners?  Customers?  IT solution providers?  At the conference, everything will turn out - not only to get acquainted with them, but also to get feedback from knowledgeable people about them.  In addition, the conference - an excellent opportunity to declare themselves.  They came to the unknown - leaving, being a good friend of a good half of the audience! <br><br><h2>  3. Get rid of stereotypes and help others. </h2><br>  We had a chance not to get rid of stereotypes, but to get rid of others.  Recruiters iChar daily communicate with IT professionals, so for a long time do not believe that "IT people are closed and uncommunicative people."  As a rule, everything is quite the opposite: they have a wonderful sense of humor and a broad outlook.  But with stereotypes about recruiting had to fight. <br><br>  Myth one: there is nothing to talk about with recruiters (and it‚Äôs not worth talking).  Our lead IT recruiter, Victoria Posledova, took an effort to dispel him.  She talked with ISDEF participants first of all about the specifics of the selection of IT staff - and at the same time about literature, music and cinema.  At IT Global Meetup, during her report, she spoke with the audience, answered questions.  And you know what?  Happened!  IT professionals were pleasantly surprised that a recruiter could be such an interesting conversationalist. <br><br>  Myth Two: Recruitment agencies do not work remotely.  This opinion is especially widespread in regions far from Petersburg and Moscow.  In fact, recruiters do not need to hold personal interviews with candidates: they are successfully replaced by Skype interviews.  This is how we find candidates for relocation to Moscow, St. Petersburg and abroad. <br><br><h2>  4. Share with colleagues what you know yourself </h2><br>  The more active the members of the professional community, the faster it develops - <a href="http://megamozg.ru/company/ichar/blog/21504/">one of the ideologists of the St. Petersburg IT specialists Piter United told</a> us about it, <a href="http://megamozg.ru/company/ichar/blog/21504/">Mikhail Ryzhikov</a> .  We fully agree with him.  Sharing knowledge is a noble cause: it moves progress forward and helps find answers to ‚Äúsensitive‚Äù questions.  For example, at IT Global Meetup, our report was devoted to a problem that is familiar to many Eucharam - the reasons why new employees do not pass the probationary period. <br><br>  Why do we need new knowledge, if nobody uses them?  Hence the conclusion: share knowledge with colleagues so that the industry develops faster! <br><br><h2>  5. Have fun </h2><br>  The schedule for IT conferences is always tight.  The educational program begins in the morning and gradually turns into an entertainment, and the importance of joint entertainment is difficult to overestimate.  Here friendship is made and the most vivid memories that bring people together are found.  Going to an IT conference, be prepared to give everything to the max.  It pays off in full - impressions, acquaintances and new knowledge. <br><br><h2>  Instead of conclusion </h2><br>  IT-specialists, as well as people who are close and not very close to them!  Go to IT conferences!  Be subject, in context and in IT society!  Learn new, meet, ask questions and answer them!  This will only benefit you and your colleagues. <br><br>  Thank you ISDEF and Piter United for the fruitful cooperation and a lot of new impressions! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/296910/">https://habr.com/ru/post/296910/</a></p>
