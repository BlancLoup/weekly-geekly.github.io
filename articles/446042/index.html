All images in order to save traffic passed through the <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/mozjpeg">optimizer mozjpeg</a> . <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  My first drone as a child was <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ny/sk/tx/nysktxyr8najns_ihffntcjfrrk.jpeg"></div><br>  I had three of them.  The first one didn‚Äôt take off, because I opened the box still on the bus on the way home and lost the gadget that holds the upper triangular yellow plate holding the blades.  The second one wiped the trigger with a kapron thread and broke the elastic inside, which twisted this thread back.  The third lived the longest, but it was blown away by the wind. <br><br>  Next was this <a href="">helicopter</a> , with which I played at home, then it was the same, but with a camera, followed by Syma x5 and x8 pro drones, in which I re-soldered their poor antennas to normal wi-fi routers and it worked smartly.  Then there was a <a href="">Walkera QR X350</a> Pro with a separate gimbal for the camera and a GoPro Chinese equivalent, and finally I rented a Mavic 1 Pro for a day and realized that all this time I was not doing that.  Of course, I bought it later and flew with pleasure for a year, but the announcement of Mavic 2 Pro deprived me of peace, and my budget - more than two thousand Australian dollars.

    <div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">So - here it is, my darling</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/yz/o-/0m/yzo-0mk_4er_cdejbuffkqc9hx0.jpeg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/gn/73/h9/gn73h9sg4zul9q8c4rrno5tcjkk.jpeg"><br></div></div><br><h4>  Problems and features that are not mentioned in the specifications or in advertising </h4><br>  Mavic 2 normally flies faster than the first.  So fast that it was necessary to get used to this separately and if you press full throttle forward with a small headwind - the angle of the hull forward makes the front sensors of obstacles useless, as the application tells us on the phone. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/rg/vk/pt/rgvkpthfriire3ztcnrdecntvtg.jpeg"><br><br>  The propellers in the kit immediately come with a reduced amount of <s>asbestos</s> noise, while the first Mavik had them simpler. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Offtop on propellers with a picture</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  An interesting story came out with these propellers - I was in a pair of droning groups on Facebook and there was just a wave of hysteria about these propellers from Mavic Platinum - dozens of posts with questions like ‚Äúis it worth buying?‚Äù, ‚ÄúI bought and this is cool‚Äù, ‚Äú and I bought and did not feel the difference "and so on. <br><br>  In general, the essence is this - these propellers have a more optimal aerodynamic shape and create a greater lifting force than stock at equal speeds.  As a result, in order to just hang you need to turn them more slowly, according to my subjective measurements in the spirit of ‚Äúplus / minus kilometer‚Äù - by 20%. <br><br>  It was checked as follows - there is a tachometer on the console, but I just thought about it now - which of the four engines does it show momentum.  I think the average value from all four.  So - with stock propellers there is 530 rpm ¬± 50 depending on the wind.  But with pathetic propellers - 420 rev / min ¬± 50. As a result of lower revolutions - the sound is not so much quieter, it is just lower in pitch, which is also perceived as lower volume. <br><br>  You can listen and compare here: <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bNFZpr7UnyI" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  In my subjective opinion, a decrease in engine speed in general gives a couple of additional minutes of flight, since energy is consumed less.  But I did not specifically test it. <br><br>  The propellers themselves are on the left of Mavic 1, on the right - of Mavic 2 / platinum. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/qn/vv/oj/qnvvojbuo5xxfssax9de2t0gqrw.jpeg"><br></div></div><br>  At the console, the sticks are now unscrewed, which on the one hand reduces the possibility of damaging the console when carrying it, on the other - they can be dropped and lost.  Below there is an additional USB connector, (like the first Mavik) where you can connect a tablet or phone or something else, but this port <b>only</b> works if you pull out the side cable, even if it is not connected anywhere.  This at one time made me think that my remote control was defective and it helped only by chance, when after charging the console I again connected a tablet to it without a side wire and it all worked. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/8c/kn/iu/8ckniunmfnyvdw8_vp-tmje1ste.jpeg"><br><br>  <b>Obstacle sensors</b> <br><br>  In advertising, there is an emphasis on the fact that the drone is hung from all sides with sensors and will not crash anywhere.  In fact, all sensors work only in two modes - Active Track and Tripod.  In the normal mode, the side sensors do not work, and in the sport mode - none at all.  In addition, Active Track has ‚Äúslow‚Äù and ‚Äúfast‚Äù modes; in the second, a warning is also displayed that the sensors will be disabled. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Several screenshots</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  Normal manual flight mode (Positioning mode) - only front and rear sensors work (in fact, it is still upper and lower, but at this altitude it does not matter). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/kg/m9/8v/kgm98v5ngwmonod9nrpics5tqrw.jpeg"><br><br>  Active Track (slow) - all sensors work. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/qx/mt/wk/qxmtwk2wlxokmjldy0jdvguwmui.jpeg"><br></div></div><br>  Personally, in my Active Track, the drone is hard on the side obstacles, because it has only one camera on its sides, which determines the presence of an obstacle, but not the distance to it, therefore flying a meter from the tree, the drone just stops and complains about the obstacle on the side, although it does not bother him at all. <br><br>  Separately worth mentioning mode Tripod (tripod). <br><br>  Initially, at the first Mavik and until a certain firmware update at the second, it was the mode in which the drone barely moves, if you try to control it, but at the same time it spends all its strength to remain stationary despite the wind.  Great mode for photos. <br><br>  After updating in this mode, you can now set the speed of movement horizontally, vertically and turns, so you can also use it for shooting video.  A separate bonus is the work of all sensors. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/3b/6m/fz/3b6mfz2pgdkow7lqferxccwptpk.jpeg"><br><br><h4>  Camera </h4><br>  That for which everything was started. <br><br>  The first problem with the camera is the plastic cover.  She scratches the top of the camera every time I put on and take off that cover. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/kj/ac/g7/kjacg7mk3zipbpudpmoflea6esc.jpeg"><br><br>  The solution is to stick the tape on the surface, rubbing against the camera.  If you look closely - you can see two slightly divergent strips.  Unfortunately, I found out about it too late and the presentation has already been spoiled. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/fe/jk/g0/fejkg0nawgesme0cnskt9rc4avs.jpeg"><br><br>  The second problem is incomprehensible changes in the video settings when changing flight modes. <br><br>  In normal mode, there are video options - 2.7K 60fps and 1080p 120fps. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Video settings screens</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/nc/nr/uf/ncnrufzmxtnjlqh9n7p1smnotqm.jpeg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ne/5h/cf/ne5hcfhismesaofkn6diel7jblk.jpeg"><br></div></div><br>  But it is necessary to switch to Active Track mode and these options disappear somewhere. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Video settings screens</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/rl/d2/hx/rld2hxbblxhf5em9uz5ko97gm28.jpeg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/gq/zj/1d/gqzj1dvwbjrrjd9v6pnwslz96xq.jpeg"><br></div></div><br>  So if I had a 2.7K 60fps video - when I go to Active Track there will be 2.7K 30 fps.  Moreover, the frame rate changes spontaneously and without any notification.  When you return from Active track to normal mode, it does not change back and remains the same - 30 fps.  I have no idea why this is happening and how the flight mode of a drone in general can affect the camera settings, but it really upset me and ruined a couple of important clips.  Now I know that every time you switch modes, you need to check the video settings. <br><br>  In Hyperlapse mode (such as TimeLapse) there is only one video format - 1080p 25 fps H264 and it is nailed tightly there.  That is, nothing can be changed at all; there is simply no button for adjusting the video. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Screen nails</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/z_/sj/gw/z_sjgwnwqkhtmtftykdr2dgwbry.jpeg"><br></div></div><br>  The solution is to tick off ‚Äúsave original photos‚Äù and then you can at least make 4K 120fps from them, but with your hands. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Settings</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ul/k4/ib/ulk4ibxzmej1wytix2k4haxa2zi.jpeg"><br></div></div><br>  The camera itself, a Hasselblad with a one-inch sensor, was supposed to be a bomb that degrades the owners of the Phantom 4 Pro, but a video from Cliff Totten from the Mavicpilots forum appeared on Youtube, where he paid attention to a strange camera problem. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Self video on Youtube in English</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/EpETzfvbmD0" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br></div></div><br>  If you do not want to watch 35 minutes - a brief squeeze: <br><br>  The video raises the problem of muddy video in 4K mode, which, according to Cliff, looks like a stretched 2.7K video.  Cliff hypothesizes that DJI faced the problem of overheating the sensor and could not provide sufficient cooling for it in such a small case.  This, in his opinion, was the reason for the postponement of the presentation The Big Picture, and since the problem manifested itself almost before the release - DJI went to the trick and programmatically made two 4K modes - normal and HQ.  The first shoots 2.7K video and stretches it to 4K, which is why soap appears, the second is real 4K, but uses only a fraction of the pixels in the middle of the sensor, which looks like a sprinkled video with a smaller viewing angle. <br>  <a href="https://forum.dji.com/thread-167744-1-1.html">The official DJI response to this video (eng).</a>  TL; DR - we are fine, you are testing incorrectly. <br><br>  I drove the same tests with a photo target and did not find this problem in myself (video on demand).  Perhaps because I have a drone from the second batch, and the first with a problem, scattered like hot cakes and in Melbourne a week after the release it was impossible to buy Mavic 2 Pro anywhere else - everything was sold out. <br><br>  Nevertheless, I still don't shoot in 4K, because I have nothing to watch such a video and I like 60 frames per second more, so 2.7K is quite enough for me. <br><br>  Night mode.  This is just something. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">2 MB of photos of the night Melbourne</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/a0/2u/7k/a02u7kivg0dg-9i-fxffpb1_gye.jpeg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/10/gc/dm/10gcdmvwz5e3ursxtvftrj1nig4.jpeg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/kv/jx/8h/kvjx8hiditdc18ogqh8zb93fcaw.jpeg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/il/f8/xf/ilf8xf4eh_cjmdqkgyekyxutuz4.jpeg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/60/dn/m3/60dnm3bj7wyiioflkjfpglc_p3c.jpeg"><br></div></div><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Random views of Australia, 2.6 Mb</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/5x/ey/5p/5xey5ppm2lupzcewiltgzxhn6zu.jpeg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/je/hi/f1/jehif1_yl5sqofr2acfffqld8iw.jpeg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/hy/fy/ld/hyfyldthdfkndpd6qle6hkyrxya.jpeg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/78/zk/4-/78zk4-zud4plgywbv-o6rio3efk.jpeg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/6b/0r/8d/6b0r8dhutkyen7t6yrcnm_rvomu.jpeg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/4y/42/t3/4y42t3sddc0enkvm3h-ozhihlt0.jpeg"><br></div></div><br><h4>  Conclusion </h4><br>  In general, I am very pleased and in my opinion the advantages of Mavic 2 Pro are significantly superior to its shortcomings.  But I think it‚Äôs good to know about these shortcomings before buying, not after. <br><br>  I hope someone my experience will be useful. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/446042/">https://habr.com/ru/post/446042/</a></p>
