And how does he call your city?  And how does it integrate with the existing telephone network of the company, implemented on the basis of PBX Definity or Panasonic?  How does he help the business? <br><br>  The fact that Asterisk is an open platform with a large selection of boards for implementing various functions does not mean that it is not necessary to invest in infrastructure development.  Perhaps, this allows talking about reducing costs and a lesser degree of risk when introducing a new functionality for business needs. <br><br>  Next, I will share a little experience in implementing Asterisk in the telephone networks of corporate clients. <br><a name="habracut"></a>

      1. It all starts with a small one:) The client has a solid business, a large team and a PBX connected to an E1 operator.  And there is a desire to do something new to improve customer service (not without our help). <br><br>  For example, add more phones at remote sites: warehouses, points of sale.  Or add a voice menu with the ability to record conversations of operators.  And there are always several solutions to the problem: use the native equipment of the customer‚Äôs PBX manufacturer or Asterisk. <br><br>  The first option is quite expensive - you can check with distributors of Avaya equipment how much CallCenter costs for 10 operators for Definity and even with digital phones and CRM integration (moreover Avaya implies equipment upgrade with serious additional investments).  This situation was repeated several times, for the Definity had sold enough.  And the Panasonic TDA series with streaming boards is complete. <br><br>  The most suitable solution for such clients turned out to be a VoIP gateway, assembled on the basis of a server with an installed Digium board for 2 E1 ports, Asterisk software.  This gateway is established ‚Äúinto the gap‚Äù of the existing E1 flow, i.e.  it becomes a bridge between the telephone network and the PBX available to the client. <br><br>  Thus, you can hang up the voice menu with all the ensuing possibilities to the necessary numbers.  Thus, it is possible to connect over SIP additional remotes for remote offices.  Thus, you can realize the potential of Asterisk without breaking the existing infrastructure of the client and not investing money in upgrading equipment of an obsolete PBX. <br><br> <a title="Habraffe.ru" href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/cd/90/cd90ad8eaa5c95217e7f170d3f4163ca.png"></a> <br><br>  2. Another part of clients has 2 or more E1 streams from various operators.  Opportunities for office PBXs are often limited by call-outs.  For example, it is difficult to make an opportunity on Avaya Definity, without frills, to make a call with a specific caller ID through a specific operator. <br><br>  And for some customers, the <a href="http://www.m-200.com/base/index.php/%25D0%259C%25D0%25A6%25D0%259A_%25D0%259C%25D0%25A0-8">MP-8 digital switches were</a> previously purchased - a relatively inexpensive solution for many tasks related to the possibility of more competently resolving traffic on corporate telephone networks.  Yes, and CDR for call detail, they also did a decent. <br><br>  Now there is an Asterisk.  You can do the same for less.  With all the ensuing features. <br><br>  For example, in addition to the traditional local operators connected via E1, you can connect the SIP operator and merge all long-distance traffic onto it.  That considerably saves the expenses of corporate clients for communication, and the payback period of implementation becomes evident quite quickly. <br><br> <a title="Habraffe.ru" href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/98/90/9890b3d494df44c7a6004847e19eae22.png"></a> <br><br>  How much does this money roll out?  To do this, it is necessary to estimate the amount of equipment required and the cost of installation time. <br><br>  Server - about $ 1000-1500 <br>  Digium 2xE1 board - about $ 1500, Digium 4xE1 board - about $ 2500 <br><br>  It is advisable to provide a more uninterruptible power supply for this case, but to remove all equipment in a rack or wall cabinet from inquisitive hands away.  Then, competently set up Asterisk, and it remains only to make rationalization proposals to the heads of the company's business units :) <br><br>  In general, for about 3-4 thousand cu  You can achieve more functionality than throw tens of thousands of dollars into solutions from Avaya, Nortel, Cisco and dive into their world with problems of licensing, support contracts, multi-position accounts, etc. <br><br>  A brief summary.  What does the introduction of Asterisk to the corporate client?  This gives the development of the company, an evolutionary approach: new features can be added as needed.  You can try to make some changes to call service without acquiring paid licenses (that is, immediately, today, and not after paying bills for the vendor‚Äôs license).  And if you don‚Äôt like something, you can make a return to the old communication scheme. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/109552/">https://habr.com/ru/post/109552/</a></p>
