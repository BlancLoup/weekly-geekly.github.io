This does not mean that HP is a bad company.  People just need to be aware of what they are getting into buying HP products. <br>  1: Many HP printers, mostly laser printers, have a built-in counter for the number of printed pages, and after reaching a certain number of pages, the printer stops working.  This is embedded in the moving parts of the printer, namely the printing drum.  Of course, you can take the printer for repair, although sometimes it is cheaper to buy a new printer OR you can simply reset the non-volatile RAM of the printer.  Absolutely all settings in the printer are reset, including the counter of the number of printed pages, but also not without a share of risk. <br><br>  2: To get rid of the voice identification system (voice control), say the English word “Agent” several times.  To do this, you will need to pronounce this word 2 or 3 times, but you will be able to control the device yourself. <br><br>  3: If the set of cartridges for your printer costs more than the printer itself, then you do not need to buy a printer.  Such a printer is considered disposable.  Even when training personnel it is reported that it is not necessary to spend more than 30 minutes to repair the device, since all this costs a lot of money and it will be easier to just replace it.

      4: HP ink cartridges are warranted separately from the printer itself.  The warranty on the printer itself may have already expired, but the cartridge most likely does not.  If the cartridge is out of order, then first call and find out about its warranty. <br><br>  5: Any HP printer that has been on the market for more than 6 months already has technical support in several countries.  This means that you can ask for help in India, Canada or Costa Rica.  In Canada, at least, they speak the “variant of the American”. <br><br>  6: If you are told that you will receive your details on such a date, then immediately contact her for technical support.  HP's shipping department recently moved to Central America.  Store employees do not contact the technical support center, because its employees see what is in stock and know when they are being cheated.  Almost all HP departments dislike supply department employees, as equipment is often lost, delivery procedures are incorrectly carried out, incomplete sets of equipment arrive, etc. <br><br>  7: Regarding the supply department.  Here is an example of a technical support call: “Oh, you haven’t received your parts yet?  Strange, you should have received them a couple of days ago.  Could you wait for me to check everything? ”(Uses another telephone line to contact the supply department, while checking on the monitor what is in stock.)“ Hi, I'm from the technical support department.  Why has Mr. Yoda not yet received his parts? ” <br>  "Yes, we are all over." <br>  “No, not over!  I see 16 more in stock! ” <br>  “Oh, sorry, I meant that the delivery is suspended because it is a duplicate order.” <br>  “No, this is the first order from this client this year.” <br>  “Then, most likely, the client incorrectly placed an order.” <br>  “No, it was we who made the order for the client.” <br>  "Sorry, then I can not help you." <br>  “I'll tell you what.  Do the work that you have been trained or the next call will be the call to your supervisor, and he will already do what he has been trained and dismiss you.  Now quickly find the right parts for me! ” <br>  “You can't do this.” <br>  “I work in HP's internal office, and I have a client on line.  Do it now".  (Returning to the customer.) “Sorry for the delay, sir.  I'll send you the necessary details right now.  Can I call you back in a couple of days and check if everything is delivered or not? ” <br>  Now, summarizing all the above, I think you should be aware of how strained the relationship exists between the technical support service and the supply department. <br>  Well, when a technical support employee calls back in a couple of days and finds out that the client still hasn’t received his details, his mood will be lost for a long time. <br><br>  8: Using non-HP ink cartridges on native printers nullifies your warranty, and sometimes freaks out the service center staff.  The Customer Support Center staff will be ready to hang you if it is proven that the printer has failed due to the use of third-party cartridges. <br><br>  9: If sellers say that your HP printer can use thick paper, it does not mean that it actually can.  Do you need reliable information about the printer?  Call the technical support center or look at the website. <br><br>  10: If your printer has just expired warranty and you have problems, call the technical support center anyway.  You will probably be referred to a warranty agent first.  In no voice objection, tell them that you have an “extended warranty” and will send you to the technical support department “user warranty claims”.  As part of HP policy, an employee MUST provide you with technical support. <br><br>  11: Do not shout at technical support staff.  Most of them have a minimum salary, and they are just waiting for a call for lunch (or about the end of work).  If you have a problem, persistently ask to call the supervisor. <br><br>  12: If you threaten with a court, the technical support officer will immediately end the conversation and hang up. <br><br>  13: Quite a large number of HP technical support staff are working on exchanges from other departments.  If you were sent to the wrong place, then it’s not difficult to simply ask if the worker knows enough about the product or question being asked. <br><br>  14: The HP website for the beta software is located at <a href="http://www.hp.com/pond/ljbeta/">www.hp.com/pond/ljbeta</a> .  Only beta versions are located here, as this software has not yet been officially released on discs.  Many of the drivers presented here can do what drivers on official disks cannot.  Corrections (hotfixes) are also presented here.  For HP employees there is a similar site, but without various kinds of advertising. <br><br>  15: <a href="http://www.hp.com/pond/pnp">www.hp.com/pond/pnp</a> Point and print = new HP toy. <br><br>  16: HP believes that countries like Canada are not worth the time or effort to trade with them.  The entire market of this country is considered equivalent to the market of one small US state.  If you are calling from Canada, you still need to prove the product warranty, and some features are available only to users from America. <br><br>  17: I often hear from American customers: “Thank God, you speak American, and not from India!” Even the staff of the technical support center do not like to contact the center located in India.  It was not a joke when it was said about the “American version”. <br><br>  18: There is also a spare, secret entrance to the HP website - only for website technical support staff: <a href="http://learning.compaq.com/wbt/e9-10200-wb/default.htm">learning.compaq.com/wbt/e9-10200-wb/default.htm</a> <br>  Here is the information on the developed products. <br><br>  19: Hewlett-Packard company representatives pay their employees pennies and, of course, you get what you pay for.  If you join a union, the company will fall apart like a house of cards. <br><br>  20: I would also like to tell you a few “stories about stupid customers”, because there are really funny ones among them.  And some, not so.  There was one customer who plugged an HP printer made in Eastern Europe into a US electrical outlet, and of course, immediately a magical blue smoke tumbled out of the printer.  There was also a customer who thought that his printer was printing on cardboard normally, as the sales agent had told him so. <br><br>  Auto: BEN POPPEN (BEN POPKEN) <br>  Netz.ru </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/7077/">https://habr.com/ru/post/7077/</a></p>
