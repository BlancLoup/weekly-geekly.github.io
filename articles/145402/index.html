  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Automated sale of electronic tickets for music events</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Once last spring, my friend and colleague Alexander <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/llxff/" class="user_link">llxff</a> was going to organize a concert in Kazan of a famous metal band.  Having well ruffled his nerves and disillusioned with the organizational work, with grief in half he still spent it. <br><br>  There were a lot of problems, and the main one was the dreary negotiations with those who in one way or another were involved in holding concerts.  Literally, bit by bit, we had to collect contacts of the right people and look for at least some information about clubs, tenants of equipment, and points of sale of tickets. <br>  And so the desire was born to maximally simplify the whole thing. <br><br>  Since the most difficult problem was the distribution of tickets to the concert, we decided to start with it.

      We have created <a href="http://orgup.com/">Orgap</a> - a platform for organizers of musical events, allowing you to quickly and easily sell tickets.  The system allows you to create descriptions of events and upload them to a common poster.  And when registering as an organizer, you can sell electronic tickets. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/97e/ff8/ca4/97eff8ca4a37eccfb2b3723485974002.jpg"><br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  To check tickets at the entrance, you can use our application on Android. <br>  The application reads the QR code on the ticket and shows the verifier of the ticket status when it is purchased, the cost and other details.  If the ticket is ‚Äúleft‚Äù, the organizer will also find out about this, as well as about trying to get through the ticket again. <br><br>  The service is written in PHP 5.4 and MySQL (Doctrine).  We use MongoDB to store the cache.  Twig is used as a template engine.  Sphinx is used as a search engine. <br><br>  The service itself lives only on a commission of 10% of the cost of tickets.  We don‚Äôt take any more money and are not going to take it.  In these 10% fall all costs associated with making payments.  We charge the commission from the organizer, so a ticket that costs 100 rubles is the same and will cost the buyer. <br><br><h4>  How is the sale made by the Organizer </h4><br>  The organizer adds the event to the site and poster.  After that, makes information about the tickets and their number.  He can change some design elements on the event page himself with the help of the designer. <br><br>  This is enough to make the event appear in the general bill, but not enough to sell.  We care about the buyers of our tickets, and therefore only legal entities and individual entrepreneurs who have entered into an agreement with us and transferred 10 rubles to the current account as an advance so that we can check the author‚Äôs good intentions can be as organizers so that we can check the author‚Äôs good intentions :) <br><br><h4>  How is the purchase </h4><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/c27/a85/27b/c27a8527b421cad762a36349d5554b38.png" align="right" title="This is what an e-ticket bought on Orgap looks like."></a>  The buyer on the event page selects the type and number of tickets, indicates the e-mail and his phone number.  After that, we transfer him to Robokassa. <br><br>  After payment, the ticket will be generated and sent by email.  Also, the buyer will immediately return to the page where we will show all the tickets purchased by him.  They can be printed directly from the browser. <br>  Although, printing a ticket is not even necessary - you can simply show the QR code on the screen of your mobile phone. <br><br>  We designed the tickets in such a way that their printouts would be convenient for folding and that the folds would not fall on the most important ticket data. <br><br><h4>  How is the ticket check </h4><br>  The representative of the organizer must stand at the entrance with an Android-based phone with our application installed. <br>  For each scan of the ticket, the application can give three answers: <br><ul><li>  Ticket is normal; </li><li>  The ticket has already passed; </li><li>  There is no such ticket. </li></ul><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/a5e/2c7/bc2/a5e2c7bc254f5d7ad12b6967ea4831ad.png"><br><br>  We specifically display information about the ticket and the date of purchase, so that in case of misunderstandings or theft of the ticket, this will help the organizer to decide to pass on the viewer.  For example, if a ticket has already passed - the organizer can start up the viewer, if he proves that it was he who bought the ticket.  And maybe not to let it on the conscience of the organizer. <br>  And if the ticket is not found - it is definitely not necessary to start up. <br><br><h4>  After the event </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/65e/045/f5a/65e045f5af214baa35991ead6b97b8a7.png" alt="      " title="This is the event in the application for the Organizers." align="right">  We transfer money for sold tickets to the organizer on the current account within 2 business days.  If a business relationship has already been established with the organizer, we can transfer money at the request of the organizer at any time. <br>  We collect information about the wishes of users, visits and site visitors.  Also, information about the time of passage to the event is returned from the application to the server system.  All statistics are available to the organizer at any time. <br><br><h4>  Problems </h4><br>  Since the start of work on the project, 3 people participated in it: a designer and two programmers.  Since we all have work, we had to work in the evenings and sometimes on weekends.  After a while, the designer left us and successfully left for Lebedev Studio. <br><br>  Almost a year ago, the plans were just a massive amount.  Looking back, we see that we have not even realized half of them.  In July 2011, experts from this event helped us to concentrate on mainly working weekend for startups (Harvest). <br><br>  We did not have any particular problems, except for a small draft from the first time working with Robokassa (as it turned out, the test server and the worker work differently for them). <br><br><h4>  In the plans </h4><br><ul><li>  Automated return tickets.  While the ticket can be returned only by contacting the feedback on the site; </li><li>  Scheme of the hall to buy tickets for sit-down events; </li><li>  Creating a client application for easy management of your tickets, event search and even faster ticket purchases; </li><li>  Sale of cards in the subway, with the possibility of replenishment.  And also think about working with NFC chips </li><li>  And also a sea of ‚Äã‚Äãother interesting ideas. </li></ul><br>  As a conclusion, I would like to thank Microsoft for their support program for start-ups BizPark, Robokassa for their prompt assistance in solving problems, as well as all our friends and acquaintances who provided invaluable support to our ideas.  ;) <br><br>  <a href="http://orgup.com/">Link to Orgap</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/145402/">https://habr.com/ru/post/145402/</a></p>
