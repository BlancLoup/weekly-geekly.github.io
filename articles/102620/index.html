  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Some obscure programming facts</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  As a programmer, I learned a lot about how software is created.  Here are some facts that may surprise you. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  A programmer spends 10‚Äì20% of his time writing the actual code, and most programmers write only <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/966800/mythical-man-month-10-lines-per-developer-day-how-close-on-large-projects">10‚Äì12 lines of code per day</a> that end up in the final product, regardless of their level.  Good programmers spend most of the remaining 90% of their time thinking, researching and experimenting to find the best solution.  Bad programmers spend this time debugging, random changes in the code and then checking it for operability. <br><br><blockquote>  <i>‚ÄúA good turner works several times better than the average, but a good programmer costs 10,000 times more than a regular one‚Äù</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Bill Gates.</i> </blockquote><br>  A good programmer is 10 times more productive than the average.  An excellent programmer is 20-100 times more productive than the average.  And this is <a href="http://www.devtopics.com/programmer-productivity-the-tenfinity-factor/">not an exaggeration</a> - studies conducted since the 1960s clearly show this.  A bad programmer is not just unproductive: he not only fails to do his job, but also creates problems that others have to solve. <br><br>  The best programmers spend very little time writing code.  At least one that gets into the final product.  Programmers who spend a lot of time on code are either too lazy, or too illiterate, or too arrogant to look for existing solutions to old problems.  Excellent programmers are masters of defining and using standard approaches.  The good ones are not afraid of constant refactoring in search of the perfect architecture.  The bad ones write code that lacks conceptual integrity, brevity, hierarchy, design patterns, and it is incredibly difficult to refactor.  Simply throw a bad code in the trash and start over, than to change something in it.

      Programs obey the law of entropy, like everything else in the universe.  Continuous changes cause program disruption, which violates the integrity of the original architecture.  This is inevitable, but programmers who do not take into account the integrity issues write programs that collapse so quickly that they become unnecessary even before they are completed.  Entropic integrity error is probably the most common error leading to project failure.  And the second most common - is the creation of a program that goes against the wishes of the client.  Destruction of programs slows development progress exponentially; therefore, many projects come to an avalanche of growing budget and deadlines, and this continues until they are completely destroyed. <br><br>  In a <a href="http://www.softwaremag.com/L.cfm%3FDoc%3Dnewsletter/2004-01-15/Standish">study of</a> 2004, it was found that most of the software projects (51%) face critical problems ( <em>failure to meet deadlines, budget overruns, failure to fulfill obligations, functional disruption, etc.</em> ), and 15% are completely fail.  This is better than in 1994, when the latter was 31%. <br><br>  Although most of the programs are created by teams, this is not a democratic activity.  Usually only one person is responsible for the architecture, the rest are only coders. <br><br>  Programming is hard work.  This is a very intense mental activity.  Good programmers think about working 24 hours, 7 days a week.  They write the best code in the soul and in their dreams.  Since the most important work is done away from the keyboard, the development of software projects cannot be accelerated, forcing people to work more in the office, or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brooks%2527s_law">adding new people to the project</a> . <br><br>  <i>From the translator.</i>  Probably, these facts are not so little known or unique.  But they seemed to me somewhere amusing, somewhere instructive, and certainly worth the attention. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/102620/">https://habr.com/ru/post/102620/</a></p>
