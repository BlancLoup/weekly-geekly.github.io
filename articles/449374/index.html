Hanging out for 8-9 hours in the office is not at all as cool as it is shown in the series.  One fine day, in the summer of 2018, I just decided that I needed more personal space and was about to retire, especially in my position at that time I had grown to the maximum and no further prospects were foreseen. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/xx/bo/0u/xxbo0ugfy4qgpsf7nd0xdxjaqem.jpeg" alt="image"><br><br>  My work was something average between support, tester, SQL operator and Excel ninja, and I wanted to delve into testing.

      As I confidently spoke and wrote in English, I decided to immediately look in the foreign market.  I looked through several freelance exchanges, read reviews about Upwork and its analogues and decided not to get involved.  It is difficult to compete in small projects with Indian citizens who are willing to work for $ 3 an hour.  It also seemed to me unproductive to apply to online services that operate on the principle of a global intermediary between remote employees and companies, judging by the reviews, the selection from them is very hard, and the pace of work is incredibly intense. <br><br>  I decided to focus on resources that offer permanent remote work in companies that could be contacted directly.  The idea was tempting, as it was very impressive to work for a foreign employer without a chain of managers and supervisors. <br>  The most useful in terms of the quantity and quality of vacancies, as well as convenience of use, were the following sites: <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <a href="http://jobmote.com/">Jobmote.com</a> <br><br>  This site is completely dedicated to finding candidates for legitimate remote work.  Since I was focused on full-time work, I appreciated that the offers on this site were mostly long-term and full-time.  All IT vacancies are grouped in a single section - Information Technology.  What is convenient - in vacancies it is almost always indicated whether they need a person living in a particular country or they are considering candidates all over the world.  Minus for me personally - there are not so many QA vacancies for those who have experience of up to a year, however, I was not surprised - testing is not the most popular area at a distance.  Therefore, I did not dwell only on this site. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ai/ur/ow/aiurowhu64xna9c5cep5f2sd00c.jpeg" alt="image"><br><br>  <a href="https://remote4me.com/">Remote4me.com</a> <br><br>  The sections of the professions on this site are spelled out in great detail in areas and programming languages.  For QA there is a section there.  In vacancies, there is a clear division into those that consider candidates only from a particular country (most often the USA) or does not matter where they live, but only an agreement to work in a particular time zone.  This site works on the principle of aggregator of several sites.  The main disadvantage is that you cannot send your resume directly from the vacancy shown, when you click on ‚ÄúView original job description,‚Äù the site redirects to the resource where the job is taken from, which also may not be directly from the employer, which, if actively searched, is a bit annoying. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/tt/ta/jy/tttajyzohip4l-5llsgzlrkzohs.jpeg" alt="image"><br><br>  <a href="https://indeed.com/">Indeed.com</a> <br><br>  This site has an intuitive design and is easy to use.  In the beginning, you can create an account and a resume that can be sent to companies directly from the site.  Although you can do without it, in every job there is a link to submit an application on the website of the employer.  The site has a local version and an American one.  Office and remote work are mixed, so in the field of the vacancy name you need to add Remote or write this word in the Where field.  Minus - when searching for a keyword in the issue, there are many vacancies that are completely irrelevant, so it takes a long time to scroll.  Also, as on other US sites, many remote vacancies do not clearly indicate whether they are considering remote candidates outside the US, until you send a request - you do not know. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/7t/xg/m5/7txgm5mt6hkmbxhveakoi5zdrqc.jpeg" alt="image"><br><br>  <a href="https://remote.co/">Remote.co</a> <br><br>  Also has a simple design and easy to use.  My specialty, QA, is in a separate section, and developer jobs for all programming languages ‚Äã‚Äãare in one heap - in the Developer section.  In addition to the vacancies on the site posted a blog with useful articles and tips, which is good for beginners udalschikov.  The filters are quite convenient, there are also some rare interesting professions.  In my specialty, there were also a couple of sensible sentences, although again, the site itself did not indicate exactly whether they were considering candidates only from the United States or whether their place of residence did not matter.  Minus - inconvenient to use from the phone browser, the mobile version is not user-friendly. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/hv/_j/ae/hv_jaea4yxbag0cr8rpx2vi4dum.jpeg" alt="image"><br><br>  I hope these resources will help those who decided to change the office chair to a comfortable home sofa.  Of course, developers will find the fastest remote job, but for the rest there are also many options. <br><br>  As for me personally, I received an offer almost simultaneously and remotely, and from a local outsourcing company working with the Netherlands, for the money was almost the same.  And I chose ... an offer from a local company, where I work now.  To be honest, then I was already completely tuned in to the ‚Äúself-directed director‚Äù mode, but free lunches (I do not cook) and medical insurance in the near future made us think.  The decisive factor was that the office was across the street from me and you can periodically work from home.  So, the story of the search for remote work ended with the next office, but for me the experience of such a search was very valuable, and it is quite likely that it will be useful to me in the future. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/449374/">https://habr.com/ru/post/449374/</a></p>
