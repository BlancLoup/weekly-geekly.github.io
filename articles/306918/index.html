  <section class="page js-page"><h1>11 Essential Hiring Tips for Starting Employers</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Being the owner of a digital agency whose head office is located ‚Äúin the region‚Äù, I am particularly keenly aware and share the problem of recruitment and recruitment.  During my work I had the opportunity to conduct dozens of interviews and competitive selection of people for different positions: sales managers, marketers, designers, programmers, project managers, advertising specialists.  It took several years to get his experience and hone the scheme.  Our team has such value as education and development.  We believe that if a person develops every day, then he is able to improve on himself and the whole world around him.  Therefore, we value knowledge and share it.  In this article, I would like to share my experience with beginning employers, those people who are looking for their best recruitment model. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a7f/1d4/1a9/a7f1d41a99ba021319c2700b8c621cd0.jpg" alt="image"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  1. Start with a clear picture of who you need. </h4><br>  Any action is best to start with a clear picture of what you need.  In this case, you must clearly consider the qualities, characteristics and skills of the people you are looking for.  It is like choosing a vector of effort before jumping.  Wrong choice - and you fly the wrong way and end up in the end, too, not where you want to go.  In our company, we use an excel file called ‚Äúcompetency matrix‚Äù.  This is a table with 4 columns.  By filling them in, you can clearly register and understand for yourself what ideally a person should have.  If you want to get a table, write to us at support@honey-hunters.ru Or you can make it yourself. <br><br>  The columns are: 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>

      <br>
      - What should he understand?  Here you answer about those areas of knowledge that should be understandable to man.  For example, he must understand business communication, English, or Internet metrics. <br><br>  - What is he capable of doing?  For example, should easily make cold calls, or collect complex technical devices. <br><br>  - What does he demonstrate?  What is the overall impression it should produce?  For example, loyalty to your business, learning, ethics, energy. <br><br>  - What experience does he have?  Here you describe what he has done before.  For example, conducted presentations. <br><br>  This approach allows you to adjust your mind to the qualities of the people you are looking for and the goal you want to achieve.  Further, over time, ‚Äúmagically‚Äù you will find such people in your team. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/495/ad4/1c4/495ad41c4115aee35693f0b918001378.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h4>  2. Think over the text of your job offer. </h4><br>  There are several important tricks: <br><br>  - Immediately indicate what the benefits of working for you?  For example, if you are looking for sales managers, write immediately that you take people with little experience and train them.  And that the best of them will have great growth opportunities.  Think about what you can put in one sentence in the first line of your ad? <br><br>  - Indicate the reason for the search, for example, ‚ÄúDue to the growth of the company‚Äù  This will give confidence and desire to go to work for you. <br><br>  - Specify more people than you need.  For example, you hire one manager, and indicate that the three.  This will also show your level of growth.  And keep in mind the statistics statistics, which I will discuss below. <br><br>  - Describe the essence of the work, make it clear and concise.  So that your people are interested, and not yours - lose interest. <br><br>  - Be sure to include the date until which date you accept the resume.  This encourages people not to delay the response to your ad. <br><br><h4>  3. Use the correct search channels </h4><br>  Which can be considered correct?  I used many different channels, starting with the publication on all sites of vacancies of our city and ending with work in social networks.  And this is what really works in my opinion: <br><br>  - Search among friends.  You have already developed a competency matrix and clearly know who you need.  Now think, is there such a person in your environment?  Ask friends and acquaintances.  I recommend not hiring friends, namely, to ask - is there anyone who might be interested.  If there are such people, call them for an interview. <br><br>  - Find the best job site in your area.  Find out the volume of vacancies in the database of sites in your region and decide which one is the largest.  I posted vacancies on several sites, but only the largest of them really helped to collect 5-10 people for a group interview. <br><br>  All other methods did not give significant results. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/fcf/d5d/7cc/fcfd5d7cc1c376311f4584e256687cb6.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h4>  4. Save your time </h4><br>  Do not spend your time on hourly interviews with many people one on one.  This is really important.  In the conditions when you need to conduct dozens of interviews - these are dozens of hours of your time, which is incredibly in demand at the initial stages of business or team development.  In addition, when you have one-on-one interviews with the respondent, you create a situation where a person who does not mean anything in your team already receives a certain status and level of attention, and he has not yet earned it.  Instead, select good resumes of people who indicate that they have experience in the field that you need and invite them for an interview on the same day and hour.  Place the chairs in a semicircle at a distance from the table, and sit at the table.  This will allow you to interview several people at once in 30-60 minutes.  For respondents, your interview will create a sense of competition and struggle.  After all, you need to fight for good places, you need to prove your desire to work in your team.  People who simply wander between different interviews, without making for themselves any particular decision about what they want - you do not need.  Please note that the best number of respondents at the interview will be 5-10 people.  Keep in mind that out of 10 confirmed the desire to come for an interview, an average of 3-6 people will come according to statistics.  Of these, one will manifest itself better than anyone. <br><br><h4>  5. Throw out the executive summary </h4><br>  The fact is that people who have already grown up in other companies to the level of managers have passed their way there and have their baggage of experience and skills.  As a rule, they do not need to grow with you and your team.  They go with their charter to your monastery and will impose their charter on you.  This is not for everyone.  It prevents you from gaining your own experience and growing.  It is much better for you to become an experienced leader yourself, and then grow leaders from your team in your culture who know your common cause well. <br><br><h4>  6. Ask people why they are looking for work. </h4><br>  Usually I started the interview by telling clearly and briefly why we needed a person in the team.  What was the reason for his search?  I spoke first, and then asked people to tell why they were looking for work.  It is important to understand what caused the search - he is a university graduate and did not work anywhere?  Did he quarrel with management or colleagues?  He decided to find something that will bring him more pleasure?  I realized that growth in a large corporation, where he had worked before, is impossible, because all the places are ‚Äúoccupied with their own‚Äù?  Want to earn more?  Look at those aspects of the presentation of yourself that are important in your business. <br><br><h4>  7. Invite people to answer their questions. </h4><br>  It is important to be open for you to open up.  People should understand as much as possible where they are going and what awaits them.  You will spend a lot of effort, time and money on the growth of these people.  Let those who do not fit leave you as soon as possible.  Ideally, right away.  Watch the structure of the questions, correlate them with your competency matrix. <br><br><h4>  8. Do not believe in the summary.  Believe in experience </h4><br>  Yes, resumes are very deceptive.  Everyone knows about it.  And even "recommendations", work experience, skills, awards, beautiful stories.  All this means nothing to you at the interview stage.  You have selected people who are more or less suitable for you, judging by the summary.  Now it is time to touch the main wisdom - the experience and practice of working with these people.  Suggest to everyone who came - try yourself in business, having worked with you for 3 days.  Even if right now you do not have enough, say, technology - offer to come and start with their laptops.  I assure you - it works very hard!  Undecided people who are looking for comfort zones will disappear immediately after the interview.  They will say to you, ‚ÄúI will think,‚Äù or something like, ‚ÄúI will come,‚Äù and they will disappear forever.  For you, this is already a victory.  People who are ready to act will surely come out for this term and begin to show themselves in action.  Further, you can filter out the most worthless for your work in 1.2 or 3 days and suggest that those who are interested in you should try further.  Experience shows that already at this stage there remain people who can and want much more than those who can be selected at long one-on-one interviews on beautiful resumes and folding speeches. <br><br><h4>  9. Make no mistake </h4><br>  Never seriously count on people who have not shown themselves "in real fights."  Chances are great to start working with a person who in all respects seems wonderful to you and immediately start making plans for him.  While the person has not shown himself in real business, at least 2 weeks - he means nothing at all for the team.  It can disappear on any day of probation for a variety of reasons.  Not just because he is a bad employee.  Perhaps in his life there are circumstances that are not compatible with your business and you are simply not on the path.  People who become part of your team will gradually show themselves, grow into the team, into your common cause and become part of the overall success.  They will share your values, bring their own and together you will create something that cannot be copied or repeated - your corporate culture.  It is her business can differ in the present. <br><br><h4>  10. Watch out for safety. </h4><br>  I do not recommend that you give extra access, share extra information with recruits for at least 2 weeks.  Only what is needed for work.  And sign a non-disclosure agreement with them. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/75a/718/05a/75a71805adecb4ec094074fd71cf4a94.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h4>  11. Create a roadmap </h4><br>  After three trial days you start the trial period.  Sit with a potential employee and discuss his action plan for 2 months in advance.  Show him where he is now and where you see him after 2 months.  What will he be able to do?  What can achieve?  It is very important to describe this and together move from point A to point B. So both of you will understand where you are going. <br><br>  Good luck finding people for your team! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/306918/">https://habr.com/ru/post/306918/</a></p>
