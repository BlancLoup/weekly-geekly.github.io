In the process of making a purchase, we are drawn into a complex range of emotions.  Some people are affected by the price, useful properties or quality of the goods.  On the other hand, there are factors of psychological impact that persuade the buyer and put pressure on him, which is significantly different from the sale or discount.  Unfortunately, many sites do not give due importance to these factors.  And such sites either close down or never reach their maximum potential.  <b>There is still time to fix it!</b> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Reliability and urgency are the two main psychological factors that encourage you to buy, subscribe or register on the site. <br><br>  So, how to show the reliability of the site and add "urgency" to your product?  How to make sure that these emotions force customers to make a purchase?  Let's look at the psychology of conversion in more detail.

      <u><b>1. Demonstration of reliability</b></u> <br>  The concept of reliability is directly related to the trust of customers.  If you reduce the possible reasons why a visitor to your site may not trust you, you will increase the conversion.  Use the following three principles to demonstrate the reliability of your site: <br><br>  <b>Connectedness</b> <br><br>  You need to simultaneously advertise your design and brand on the website and in other sources.  It is necessary to observe the connectedness of advertising on Twitter and Facebook pages with the aesthetics of the site design and the logo. <br><br>  All brand details and advertising in different sources must be visually related. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/717/db5/11f/717db511f6374efdb8c1d0f894285a95.png" alt="image"><br><br>  From the point of view of psychology, if related sources are not related to the main brand, the buyer loses confidence in the individual products of the brand.  For example, when you go to IKEA, you clearly understand what services you get with the main products of IKEA.  So you have growing confidence when you buy products of this brand, because you know what to expect. <br><br>  Such product coherence instantly increases conversion, but, more importantly, it will ensure brand credibility for a long time, and this will force the buyer to constantly return to you for new purchases. <br><br>  <b>Personal approach</b> <br><br>  We want to be treated as individuals, not as buyers.  People want to build relationships not with the brand, but with other people. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/7ff/13d/fa7/7ff13dfa7c414d76baec5836c7bb94c5.png" alt="image"><br><br>  If you issue descriptions, headlines, promotions and other content in a more person-centered way, you will be able to create a high level of trust by passing the information personally to the client, as during a conversation. <br><br>  In calls to action, use "you", "your" / "you", "your".  In a blog, speak in the first person: ‚ÄúI,‚Äù instead of ‚Äúwe.‚Äù  So you will create a sense of familiarity with you and your business. <br><br>  Companies such as GoPro use this method to motivate their customers not only to purchase their products, but also to use it and leave feedback in the community. <br><br>  <b>Real example</b> <br><br>  Using testimonials, social networks and other social signals creates customer confidence that your product is valued, widely used or well known, which removes customer doubts and increases conversion. <br><br>  There are many ways to demonstrate real-life examples, experiment and select the best one for your case. <br><br>  For example, Slack used a video on the main page showing how real customers use their technology. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/1c8/74e/c5b/1c874ec5b75249a7aa8c15f7f572898e.png" alt="image"><br><br>  This is a way not only to present the effectiveness of the technology itself, but also to set a real example. <br><br>  The company Zirtual apply the same approach to the design of the main page of your site, showing the product with real reviews of satisfied customers. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/84f/f92/81e/84ff9281e8a34e0ebe9c8e8fdfdf17a9.png" alt="image"><br><br>  <u><b>2. Creating urgency</b></u> <br>  Urgency is a more difficult and hidden technique for implementation, but now it is the most effective. <br><br>  Creating urgency in the ability to purchase your product can significantly increase the desire of customers to buy the product.  This is a powerful psychological anchor that changes people's thinking from ‚Äúbuy from you or from your competitor‚Äù to ‚Äúbuy your product now or be left with nothing‚Äù. <br><br>  As a rule, if customers really need your product, they will quickly make the right decision, which is based on three simple principles: <br><br>  <b>Time</b> <br><br>  Does the product have a fixed purchase date?  Is there a limited number of hours to buy?  Is there a potential gain from buying now (discount or cheap delivery)? <br><br>  Such principles related to time will dramatically increase the urgency of your proposal without restrictions on the product itself.  That is why in advertisements they use the phrase ‚Äúif you call within 30 seconds.‚Äù This is a strong psychological device. <br><br>  Experts to increase conversion proved the high efficiency of this method, just by placing watches on the site for online sale of flowers.  The clock counted time for delivery in one day. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/6ec/f61/ad4/6ecf61ad41fe41768b2c2955ed514f8c.png" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>Limited supply</b> <br><br>  Creating a supply constraint will dramatically increase the demand for products, which will affect the intensive increase in conversion.  If the test campaign goes well, you can always return to this reception.  You can also assign additional cost for a limited supply. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c41/2be/353/c412be3533ef441aa850c729d498043b.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  On the example of ModMom products, Shopify website showed excellently how a sense of urgency raises the demand for regular goods and in some cases attracts media attention. <br><br>  <b>Exclusivity</b> <br><br>  Exclusivity is a rare device that will simultaneously increase the demand for goods and strengthen the real example.  Mailbox applied this principle to the virtual queue when they launched the first iOS application. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/769/454/105/76945410586d43678cb0b345d257d815.png" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>This page shows two main points:</b> <br><br>  1. Demonstration of restrictions on the availability of the product, which increases the joy of the client finally defend the entire queue. <br>  Proof of a real example of the existence of 780,000 people also waiting in line to gain access to the application. <br>  2. With the help of such a virtual queue page, Mailbox caught the attention of the media, almost every site wrote about technical updates about them.  And, plus to this, a huge mass of customers. <br><br>  If Mailbox had not specifically limited the availability of its application, there would have been no such attention to their product. <br><br>  <b>Always test</b> <br><br>  Any company, any website and any application has its own unique characteristics and a separate market. <br><br>  Never rely solely on the positive experience of a single company that can turn out to be a failure for you. <br><br>  Install a conversion analysis program to conduct A / B testing of various home page options for your site, and select the most successful one.  If you change the site without testing, you can hurt yourself. <br><br>  Do not let things take their course, track, plan, test and achieve high results. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/246037/">https://habr.com/ru/post/246037/</a></p>
