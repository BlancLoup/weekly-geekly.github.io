  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Two days left until the Moscow Python conference. What is interesting in the program?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/59/e7/49/59e749762fd40989262678.png"></div><br>  At Voximplant, we not only create a telephony platform for JavaScript developers and organize our own <a href="https://intercomconf.com/">INTERCOM</a> conference once a year, but also support industry colleagues.  In my spare time from Voximplant promotion, I help the <a href="http://moscowpython.ru/">Moscow Python</a> community: we do mitapes, training courses, an annual conference ‚Äî all this fun movement around the community-forming programming language itself.  The day after tomorrow, on Friday, October 20th, there will be a big Moscow Python Conf conference, for which I helped select speakers, make a program, and during which I will conduct one of two streams.  Two days before the start - it's time to remember about the conference, <a href="https://conf.python.ru/">check out the program</a> again and request a discount for the users from me in person.  Discounts I knocked out ten of the rest of the organizers, who was the first - that and sneakers. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The motive of the conference has not changed since last year: communication over a cup of delicious coffee is our everything.  The speaker tells his vision of interesting questions, after which it is customary to seize him, break the coffee and talk about what is new in the industry.  This year we have gathered a lot of international speakers so that we can communicate not only about Russian realities, but also compare the approaches to the development and use of programming languages ‚Äã‚Äãin different countries. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/59/e7/49/59e74999233d1137477329.jpeg" align="left">  Many people know Alejandro Saucedo: a charismatic developer from Bloomberg came to Russia several times to help with hackathons, led the crazy Hack Train project of the hackathon-in-traveling train for many years, and recently opened his company and started Machine Learning.  All are currently engaged in machine learning.  Together with his colleague, Alejandro will talk about using Python to solve various problems associated with machine learning.  And, what is most valuable, he is ready to answer your questions on the sidelines.  I will personally make sure that the speakers do not hide from the guests and talked for the maximum amount of time at the coffee points. <br><br clear="all"><p></p><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/59/e7/49/59e749f7bce00908965932.jpeg" align="right">  Tony Camps is not exactly a programmer.  More precisely, not a programmer at all.  What does he do at our conference?  He tells how he has been hiring programmers in London and the USA for 7 years already.  The labor market, expectations from resumes and vacancies, career growth, distant work - he will tell about all this at a large workshop where you can ask him questions right during the presentation.  And after the performance.  And before the performance. <br><br clear="all"><p></p><br>  We have also gathered developers who will tell and then be ready to talk about TensorFlow, microservices, cloud platforms, blockchains, Django, binary modules and other interesting things that we have been running every day for work or that have been heard for the last couple of years.  I myself will speak in a special ‚Äúcase‚Äù section, where I‚Äôll tell you how we use TensorFlow to teach the Voximplant cloud to automatically guess the voice mail using two <s>notes</s> seconds of conversation. <br><br>  As promised before the kata, there are several discounts reserved for Hub users, which I am ready to share in personal messages.  Well, any questions about the conference, the community and Python are welcome! </div>
