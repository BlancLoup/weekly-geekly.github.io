A huge amount of work has been done on the program and the reports - we have previously written about this in the <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/jugru/blog/343812/">conference announcement</a> and in a <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/jugru/blog/352364/">separate article</a> . <br><br>  In this program, we have brought together the entire program in the form of one large list, with descriptions of reports and speakers.  You can start thinking now which reports you should go to - you have to choose between three parallel tracks.  In addition, there is still the opportunity <a href="https://dotnext-piter.ru/tickets/">to purchase tickets</a> .

This is a video with a cat falling from a chair!  You answer "LOL", put the phone back in your pocket ... But do you think what it took to make it all work?  Inside even the cheapest smartphone there are thousands of innovations, algorithms, inventions - but how do they work?  How were they developed?  What will the next generation of algorithms and applications look like? <br><br>  In this report, we will be able to immerse ourselves in the technologies by which our ordinary household items work, and we unearth algorithms and abstractions that create our new digital world.  We will look at everything: network addressing algorithms, frequencies in cellular networks, optimization of the shortest distance search, wavelet-compression, fingerprint recognition, media encoding methods, and so on.  After this report, you will no longer be able to relate to your mobile phone as before. <br><br clear="all"><br clear="all"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/0f2/5ed/cb0/0f25edcb07d033d5f11270b1696f6654.jpg" width="200" align="left">  <b>Dylan Beattie</b> / Skills Matter <br><br>  Dylan is a systems architect and developer who has been involved in many projects in his life, from small websites to huge distributed systems;  from Legacy with a twenty-year history to the latest developments.  He now works as an architect in Spotlight and is engaged in solving complex problems in modern distributed systems.  In parallel with the main work, Dylan is actively involved in the community, is the organizer of the London .NET User Group and in 2016 participated in many conferences, including Oredev in Sweden, NDC in London, Sydney and Oslo, Tampere Goes Agile in Finland and BuildStuff in Lithuania and Ukraine . <br><br clear="all"><hr><h1>  <a href="https://dotnext-piter.ru/2018/spb/talks/2qatbxw8hsucaikiosmoem">Fastware</a> </h1><br>  Optimization - that is, code acceleration - is one of the main ingredients of modern computing technologies.  The speed of light is limited, so you can not overclock the frequency of the processors;  On the other hand, matter consists of individual atoms, therefore it is impossible to make the schemes smaller than they are made now.  So, for modern tasks such as self-managing machines or general artificial intelligence, methods of acceleration will have to be invented with our own brains. <br><br>  This paper talks about two new examples at different ends of the spectrum of optimization techniques.  The first technique is related to iron: you can replace brunches with calculations.  Modern processors work much better with sequential code than with unpredictable brunches, we will exploit this fact.  The second example will be about the classical algorithm, which can be improved using statistical data on the distribution and localization of data, and this improves its theoretical and practical performance. <br><br clear="all"><br clear="all"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/755/6b2/de3/7556b2de3a254ee7a64f29b7a05574fb.jpg" width="200" align="left">  <b>Andrei Alexandrescu</b> / The D Language Foundation <br><br>  Andrei Alexandrescu is an expert on a variety of things, including the design and implementation of software systems, the design of programming languages, libraries, all aspects of C ++ and D, machine learning and the processing of natural languages.

In this report, the containers are shown as they really are: normal processes, but with some amount of isolation, a quota for resources, and all this is sprinkled with sandboxing on top of security.  You will understand why containers are so interesting and useful, how neimspaces isolate containers from each other, how to fumble resources between containers, how throttling works, how it all relates to .NET runtime and how to write a minimal .NET Core application that won't drag with an unnecessary 500 megabytes of user-space libraries and utilities from Ubuntu. <br><br clear="all"><br clear="all"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b74/d38/301/b74d3830150229dba2e3d6df65e9bab6.jpg" width="200" align="left">  <b>Sasha Goldshtein</b> / Sela Group <br><br>  Sasha Goldstein - CTO at Sela Group, Regional Director and MVP at Microsoft, author of books at Pluralsight and O'Reilly, international consultant and trainer.

The report will tell about the rules of effective debugging.  With real examples, we will see how adherence to the process helps to quickly find errors in the system.  Also talk about proactive debugging and how to use it.  We show how debugging can become part of the application architecture. <br><br clear="all"><br clear="all"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/bd4/da1/24f/bd4da124f95f014f7ab846ad82b44176.jpg" width="200" align="left">  <b>Sergey Schegrikovich</b> / dotmailer <br><br>  Sergey is developing a globally distributed .NET application with a decade of history.

How to help tests find bugs: write tests or still generate them? <br><br>  The report will not be a ‚Äúsilver bullet‚Äù that would help you build your flexible team or else make the UI regress differently.  We will focus mainly on the problem of effective tests using a property based approach.  The examples show how to use FsCheck in conjunction with C #. <br><br>  Surely you are faced with a situation where unit tests for methods were written, testers conducted regressions, and bugs appear as if from nowhere.  The Dodo IS system development team is no exception.  When the product is divided into semantic parts, the question of who will check the services that have appeared and how to deal with their integration has become acute. <br><br>  Close cooperation of business, QA and developers, experiments with different approaches and practitioners, implementation of tests in CI is our way to quick feedback and improving the quality of the product delivered to customers. <br>  Service without bugs - a pledge of delicious pizza ... <br><br clear="all"><br clear="all"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/34c/519/1a2/34c5191a2b955433a0526a7c3cde7c82.jpg" width="200" align="left">  <b>Julia Kovaleva</b> / Dodo Pizza <br><br>  Yulia graduated from the magistracy in LETI, having decided that her Altai fundamental education should be made more applied.  After graduating, she has been working in the field of software testing for the 5th year and does not regret it.  Perhaps the search for an incorrect solution or an incorrectly stated task condition is a skill that has been grafted since the days of school math battles.  Julia managed to go from the analyst-tester with hard management, where the step is left-right and shooting, to an automator with the duties of a lead.  She is not afraid of experiments, unfamiliar development languages ‚Äã‚Äãand frameworks: the main thing is to do the work efficiently and help the team.  Julia hopes that the April DotNext will delight all participants not only with interesting presentations, but also with its St. Petersburg spiritual atmosphere. <br><br clear="all"><hr><h1>  <a href="https://dotnext-piter.ru/2018/spb/talks/1hgzg16ahu8muaaqosgaou">C # in the browser - myth or reality?</a> </h1><br>  Every year the world is moving more and more from full-fledged installed applications in the direction of clients running in the browser to web services.  With this transition, the requirements for the complexity of those continue to grow, which leads to the need to use languages ‚Äã‚Äãwith strong typing and rich syntactic possibilities. <br><br>  Successfully occupying server, desktop and mobile development niches, C # now moves to the browser.

Most likely, you already have a website, and maybe a mobile application, and the most serious friends also have a desktop application.  But do you have a chatbot?  Your users already have Slack, Skype, Facebook and many other places, why not give them the opportunity to communicate with your service directly, in a more ‚Äúhuman‚Äù way? <br><br>  In this report, you will get acquainted with the Microsoft Bot Framework and the Azure Bot Service and see how to build a waiter‚Äôs bot using them, breaking through all kinds of tasks arising from this.

For financial transactions, immortal SQL remains. <br><br>  The team working on the Orleans framework is no stranger to questioning generally accepted "truths."  She has already shown that, if properly applied, distributed objects can be successfully used to build efficient scalable applications, offering a convincing alternative to the Erlang / Akka approach to the model of actors. <br><br>  Support for scalable distributed transactions is one of the latest Orleans innovations, refuting popular misconceptions.  Sergey Bykov will talk about it, as well as other advanced functions of the framework. <br><br clear="all"><br clear="all"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/6e7/9d3/ae7/6e79d3ae7c81d1f371fc1554ea119fb8.jpg" width="200" align="left">  <b>Sergey Bykov</b> / Microsoft <br><br>  Sergey Bykov started the Orleans project at Microsoft Research and continues to lead its development in open source in the Xbox division.

You heard about Docker and microservices.  But what are the ‚Äú12-factor applications‚Äù mentioned in the title?  This methodology, originally developed by engineers who deployed to Heroku, is a ‚Äúrecipe for success‚Äù when writing code for any cloud platform.  This report describes the essence of the method and demonstrates how to write an application for .NET that would meet all the requirements of this method.  Absolutely there will be live examples using ASP.NET Core, the light and dark sides of applications built in this way are outlined;  It will show how this can be deployed without a server, and using Azure Service Fabric. <br><br clear="all"><br clear="all"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/65d/37c/7be/65d37c7be54281aa53369b3068f535ff.jpg" width="200" align="left">  <b>Ian Cooper</b> / Huddle <br><br>  Polyglot Coding Architect, based in London, co-founder of #ldnug, speaks at conferences.
