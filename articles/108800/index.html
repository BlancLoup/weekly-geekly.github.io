A week after launch, we began to receive complaints from visitors who had duplicate order information.  I will not go into the technical details of the problem, but its solution was not at all as obvious as it might seem. <a name="habracut"></a>

      No programmer was able to reproduce the error.  There were a lot of potential sources of the problem, and we have long and unsuccessfully (if you can call it unsuccessful, their serviceability :) checked all modules.  And only after analyzing the server logs it reached us. <br><br>  As you might have guessed from the name of the topic, the source of the error was a banal doubleclick.  As our sample shows, 10% of users clicked on the link twice.  For obvious reasons, no programmer managed to reproduce the bug.  And surely no one would have thought that the problem was so high-level :) Why such a problem became possible in principle is a topic for a separate topic. <br><br>  Indeed, people not belonging to generation Y have a discord between the interface of the operating system and the interface of the browser window.  As a result, 10% of customers click on the links of the online store twice.  But it is not in Russia.  I think that in Russia the percentage will be much lower, but not due to the general computer literacy of the population, but due to the weak development of e-commerce and the mistrust of generation X representatives to online stores. <br><br>  PS I read the comments and it was funny.  They already accuse programmers of lack of professionalism, etc.  However, I do not specifically describe the details of the problem in order to avoid offtopic.  And the problem is quite specific and uninteresting.  But in the comments, double-prevention prevention specialists have already determined that our order is made by simply clicking on the link and that our competence is slightly less than zero. <br>  Thanks for the comments :) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/108800/">https://habr.com/ru/post/108800/</a></p>
