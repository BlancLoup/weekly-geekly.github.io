To be more precise, the company's web services are more popular and in demand than all the company's websites in the world combined.  According to comScore, Amazon has become the seventh most visited US site.  In Britain, the site became 6, in Canada 9, in Germany and in Japan 11, in France 20. In other words, Amazon is huge, which means that all sites operating on the AWS platform must also be large (at least in total mass). <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Adapted versions of Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2), a service that provides computing power in the form of Internet services, and Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3), an online storage service, continue to evolve.  This can be confirmed by the fact that the bandwidth used by these services in Q4 2007 was higher than the bandwidth used by all Amazon.com sites in the world during the same period last year. <br><br>  Erick Schonfeld of TechCrunch said, ‚ÄúIt says that all companies using the Web-scale computer infrastructure are more than Amazon.com in general, at least when measured with bandwidth.‚Äù

      Amazon also announced that there are 330,000 developers using Amazon Web Services (AWS), which is 30,000 more than last quarter.  The adaptation of the Amazon platform employs 200,000 programmers who have committed to using the Facebook platform.  Amazon recently launched a special page for Facebook programmers, hoping to attract programmers to the AWS platform. <br><br>  In November, Robert Scoble distrusted the future of an off-server Internet company.  Thanks to the Amazon web service, anyone can make a website without having to have a server, and many companies use it.  ‚ÄúLet's speak honestly.  Amazon used to be a bookstore.  Now they are hosting virtual servers for Internet companies. ‚Äù <br><br>  Just over a year ago, Alex Iskold wrote about Amazon Web Services, noting that they "are proof of the existence of a new computer paradigm, when web services in the total mass are a new incentive for the development of operating systems with a new network base" .  Alex also acknowledged that small and medium businesses will be the first to start using Amazon‚Äôs scale platform.  "Companies with Wall Street will not pay attention to it." <br><br>  Among the companies that have used Amazon AWS are not yet those who are on the list of the 500 largest in the world, but there are those who are successfully reaping the fruits of the era of the development of the web 2.0 network.  The data presented today shows that even despite the fact that Amazon does not make huge money through its web services (TechCrunch believes that AWS‚Äôs profit is exactly the same $ 131 million noted in the ‚ÄúOther sources of income‚Äù for the 4th quarter , which include other types of services and do not exceed $ 5.7 billion in total profit for the 4th quarter of the year), they found a common language with programmers and position themselves as the main provider of infrastructure services for a whole generation of web applications. <br><br>  ps And someone from Habraludey uses Amazon services? </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/31396/">https://habr.com/ru/post/31396/</a></p>
