  <section class="page js-page"><h1>What are the bad sample solutions for ‚Äúquick launch‚Äù of your own business?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"> We were prompted to write this article by a theme (in blogs on 1C-Bitrix) from Roman Zabrodin, which discusses the possibility of the existence of a small studio of 3 specialists who will deal exclusively with selling template solutions (finished products) from the marketplace of 1C-Bitrix and their integration.  Unfortunately, the link to the article was lost somewhere, but the viability of the model was discussed there, when the company deals only with sales of standard solutions and their integration, without any individual developments. <br><br>  It is no secret that in recent years there has been a real boom and the marketplace has grown from a cozy place modestly equipped with modules, into a real marketplace with challenging banners, thousands of solutions and strong competition. <a name="habracut"></a>  There are leaders here and there are outsiders, those who are in the ‚Äútrend‚Äù and those who missed, but that's not the point. <img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/6ec/39e/b3d/6ec39eb3dbb812467b979f442eaff3fe.jpg" width="300" height="225" align="left" alt="image"><br><br>  At first glance, the advantages of the marketplace are obvious to everyone. <br>  For developers, this is a great chance to realize their ideas and put them up for sale, as well as to receive additional income for the solutions that have already been developed, which were paid for by the customers, simply rebuilding them and putting them in a digestible form in the marketplace. <br>  For other partners, this is a good chance to buy the right solution, which is much cheaper than its real value if the studio was engaged in the development, individually for a given customer. <br>  It would seem that everything is in the black and you can only rejoice, but we sort of were going to talk about the shortcomings?

      <b>So, what's so bad about the marketplace?</b> <br>  The greatest harm is a certain aura that says ‚Äúyou can do cool and cheap.‚Äù  Most solutions offer simplicity, speed, convenience, quality at low cost.  Marketing does not stand still, and people are convinced that in order to start a project / store, just a small amount for the 1C-Bitrix license and the prettier template and everything is enough, you can cut the red ribbon and prepare with a smile to meet customers who are now flowing. <img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b0b/8d4/3fb/b0b8d43fb07a1899de29cdb99aa0f0b7.png" width="223" height="225" align="right" alt="image"><br>  Unfortunately, this is not the case.  In one of the last articles, <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/post/300746/">why not make an online store, earn a million and go to Goa?</a>  We discussed this moment, so we will not dwell on it in detail.  If you're interested, you can read it and draw your own conclusions. <br><br>  <b>Why do we raise the question of online stores?</b>  It's simple.  We are also developers of solutions for online stores on 1C-Bitrix, so we are faced with such situations directly.  Yes, we also love to play marketing and convince customers that with our solution life will really become easier.  We are not deceiving anyone, and the solution, of course, saves weeks of manual labor, with the prospect of further development, but we still need to work hard with it. <br><br>  Let us return to Roman Zabrodin and his post.  During the discussion, the idea was expressed that the work on the proposed scheme does not motivate developers, because 10% of projects live to some kind of development, the rest die in the bud.  The analogy was given with the subscription to the fitness center.  It‚Äôs not enough to buy it, in order to achieve the set goal, you need to withdraw all the classes, and then extend it for several months or years, and only then the result will be visible.  I think many of you are familiar with this, because almost everyone at one time tried to go to the gym and pull the barbell, or shake the press, run and work out at the gym. <img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/29f/8da/910/29f8da910f2e4495aac389181ef5e2ad.png" width="350" height="225" align="left" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>Let's stop for an example on a bar</b> .  Not everyone knows that the best exercises for gaining muscle mass are squats and deadlifts, but many novice athletes do not.  They come to the gym and immediately go to do the bench press, before hanging more pancakes.  After several intensified attempts to lift a heavy load, they run to the mirror to see the result.  But not seeing this result, after several trainings, the person quits training and continues to move away from the previously set goal.  There is nothing bad in it, such is the nature of man, to constantly struggle with laziness and win in some battles, while retreating in others.  It is also projected onto business relationships. <br><br>  Seeing that some of the customers who bought our solution stop at the ‚Äúlaunch of the project‚Äù stage, it becomes a bit annoying, because the goal of each developer is to make his decision massive, popular, useful (at the end of the day) to solve customer problems and be irreplaceable tools for doing business.  And of course, I would like, with all this, to earn a little money for its maintenance and development. <br><br>  After such a client buys a solution, he tries to ‚Äúplay‚Äù a businessman, facing problems that are inherent in each undertaking - you need to go into it, you need to adapt, check different variations and see which one is more suitable.  It takes time, effort, resources.  But in the head of this businessman, an idea has already been laid, which was prompted by the participants of the marketplace, that everything can be achieved quickly and easily, in a couple of clicks. <img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/cc8/3d1/36b/cc83d136bfac29e10407cb24383a1828.jpg" align="right" width="350" height="225" alt="image">  As a result, there is a dissonance and the man, instead of a struggle, gives up.  60-80 thousand rubles, which he spent on launching an online store, no longer seem such a big amount, compared to what lies ahead.  Gradually, a person loses interest in this project, stops believing himself, believing developers, believes that he was deceived, or that he is not able to do it and sunset sets in.  For a client, it‚Äôs just a waste of resources, time and nerve cells.  For the developer, this is also a sad situation, because he will not receive positive feedback, feedback, recommendations, and will not be able to sell useful functionality or other useful solutions to this client and those he could attract. <br><br>  <b>So what to do in this situation?</b> <br>  You can leave everything in the same place where it is now, because we always want to believe in a miracle and be deceived.  A.S.  Pushkin wrote: <br><br>  <i>Ah, it's not hard to fool me! ..</i> <i><br></i>  <i>I myself am happy to be deceived!</i> <br><br>  This of course does not mean that developers are cheating their customers.  No, you just have to always remember that there is nothing simple in this life, and any business requires serious work, especially in such a difficult time for the country and its inhabitants. <br>  We suggest getting rid of this aura of simplicity and cheapness. <br><br>  - Want to create your own business?  Please prepare to invest not only with money, but also with other resources and do not even think about making everything simple, fast and ‚Äúcheap‚Äù <br><br>  Then people will more realistically perceive the situation and will be more inclined to spend money with benefit, first of all for themselves, and not just invest them in what they eventually abandon in a couple of months.  But this scheme will work only if all participants stick to it.  If company ‚ÄúA‚Äù explains to the client that the project will take 6 months and cost 1 million rubles, then company ‚ÄúB‚Äù will seduce him with 2 months, 300 thousand rubles (if not cheaper) and a pretty manager girl, looking at which, the client already want to work with these guys.  Needless to say, these 300 thousand will still result in 1 million or even a large amount, but a lot of nerves will be spent, a lot of time will be drunk, many cups of coffee will be drunk and many sleepless nights will be spent.  And even a pretty girl manager will not be there to please the eyes, because she will be on maternity leave. <br><br>  Such cases, but the order of things is unlikely to change in the near future, so we continue to do what we did. <br><br>  PS: Sorry for the girl manager, just the situation of life. <br>  PPS: Roman Zabrodin is a man who in 2012 <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/bitrix/blog/150985/">published a</a> post that earned 1 million rubles selling his solutions through the marketplace. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/301286/">https://habr.com/ru/post/301286/</a></p>
