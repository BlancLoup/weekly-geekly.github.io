  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The Chinese have opened the Skype protocol</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  A small Chinese company announced it had hacked the Skype protocol.  Now you can connect to the Skype network through an alternative client software, as well as detect, recognize and block voice traffic. <br><br>  The Chinese promise to release the client program to the market until the end of August 2006. It will eliminate some of the shortcomings of the original client, for example, it will consume less computing resources of the PC and will not support <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/5/33278.html">‚Äúsuper-nodes‚Äù</a> technology, with which any user's computer can be used as gateway to transfer traffic between computers of other users.  That is, the Chinese Skype client will not ‚Äústeal‚Äù computing resources, as the original client does.  And even more so in it there will be no banner advertising, about which Skype developers have already announced. <br><br>  The hacking of the proprietary Skype protocol became known on July 13, 2006. Charlie Paglee, director of <a href="http://www.talqer.com/">Vozin Communications</a> , a company that specializes in VoIP communications services and has offices in the United States and China, <a href="http://www.voipwiki.com/blog/%3Fp%3D16">reported</a> this in a blog post.  He said that he was called by a ‚Äúfriend from one Chinese company‚Äù, and the call was made not from the Skype program, but from another client program.  Charlie also posted her <a href="">screenshot</a> .

      The Chinese company, whose name is not reported (it is known only that it employs 10 people and that it received venture funding), is going to improve its program and launch it on the market.  Currently, it only implements P2P calls, but in the future, developers plan to implement presence status, chat, and other functions so that their program is 100% compatible with the native Skype client.  Apparently, the Chinese company will launch three separate components on the market with which it will be possible to create compatible applications. <br><br>  Skype representatives refuse to comment on the "feats" of Chinese colleagues.  Firstly, there is still no evidence that the proprietary Skype protocol has been hacked - the client program has not yet been released.  Secondly, even if the Skype company (more precisely, its current owners - eBay Corporation) will try to take some measures for legal pressure on Chinese hackers, then these measures are unlikely to be able to bring results.  It is very hard to sue the Chinese company, especially since Skype itself is banned in China.  It is even possible that local authorities encourage hacking of a closed protocol, because it allows you to quickly and reliably block voice traffic on the web.  In addition, the Skype protocol itself is not patented and, it seems, is not forbidden to open it.  If this is true, then there can be no complaints about the Chinese at all. <br><br>  According to experts, this case is more proof of the wrong policy of Skype, which refuses to make its communication protocol open and allow independent developers to create applications compatible with Skype.  Of course, on pre-negotiated mutually beneficial terms.  If the protocol is closed, then some will be tempted to hack it, and already from this Skype will receive absolutely no benefit. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/4173/">https://habr.com/ru/post/4173/</a></p>
