Placement of goods on the trading floor</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ab8/6fc/1a1/ab86fc1a1ee04b1db7083326816d2530.png"><br><br>  In this small and simple case we will tell you what pair products are and how to increase the profitability of a business with the help of associative relationships. <br><br>  So, <b>Couples</b> are products that are often bought together.  In a pair of one product is the key (anchor), and the second - related.  On-line service <a href="http://datawiz.io/ru/">Datawiz.io</a> reveals the paired relationship of goods using the algorithm <b>APRIORI</b> . <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Analyzing shopping baskets, we identify key products and related pairs to them.  Such pairs can be a huge amount, limited only by the assortment of the store.  Each such pair has its own frequency of purchases, the percentage of the probability of buying together and the number of checks in which the pair occurs during the selected period. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/5a2/eb8/820/5a2eb882098dc11ad0677bef06bbf121.jpg" alt="image"><br>  For example, a pair of "Snacks-Seafood" and "Beer" is found in 435 checks for a month.  Couple support - this pair is found in 1.29% of the total number of store receipts over this period.  The authenticity of the pair - when you buy a key product "Snacks" 60.17% of buyers acquire the related product "Beer".

      "So what?" - You say.  ‚ÄúHow do I use this data?‚Äù  What benefits do I get? ‚Äù.  Owning such information, you will be able to promptly stimulate sales of key products, thereby increasing the volume of sales of high-yield related products.  Tables of paired products are designed to significantly facilitate marketing control. <br><br>  The second method of applied use of paired goods is recommendations regarding the placement of goods in the sales area.  These recommendations are used to understand which products are better placed next to and which are far away without losing customers. <br><br>  You can create a schedule of product placement based on Support and Reliability.  Points on the chart are pairs of goods.  Based on their location on the chart, you can draw conclusions about their placement on the sales area relative to each other. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f47/b78/ea0/f47b78ea09fcdbf57bf6ae964151b59a.jpg" alt="image"><br>  1) In sector 1 there are pairs with a strong relationship.  The probability of buying a related product when buying a key is very high.  Also a high percentage of checks with these pairs.  Products sold well, such as ‚ÄúSnacks‚Äù and ‚ÄúBeer‚Äù, can be located far from each other and this will not lead to a drop in demand. <br><br>  2) In sector 2 there are pairs in which the probability of buying related products decreases, although their support in checks remains high.  To correct the situation and increase sales of related products, you should put them next to the key. <br><br>  3) Sector 3 displays random pairs. <br><br>  4) In pairs from sector 4, the percentage of checks in which they are found is rapidly falling.  The likelihood of purchasing a related product with a key one, on the contrary, is growing.  Such couples need additional stimulation, such as promotions and billboards.  But at the same time they do not necessarily have a number. <br><br>  Making a daily analysis and using associative relationships of products, we get the result: <br><br>  - saving time and efficient use of retail space; <br>  - reduction of marketing costs; <br>  - obtaining additional profits from the sale of related products without additional investments. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/241738/">https://habr.com/ru/post/241738/</a></p>
