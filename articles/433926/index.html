    <img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/zf/kp/fu/zfkpfug2w22azi-pnsp97nyqmek.jpeg"><br>  <b>State of JS</b> <br><br>  In this article, we will rely on the data and conclusions of State of JS, as well as on insights, which JetBrains shared in its annual report The State of Developer Ecosystem. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h3>  What is State of JS? </h3><br>  Annual survey about all that concerns JavaScript.  The beautifully visualized responses of the developers participating in it reflect the current state of JavaScript.  The survey covers the following topics: frontend frameworks, databases, stateful tools, framework relationships, the choice of framework developers and ease of use, JavaScript-compiled languages, mobile frameworks, JavaScript code testing tools, and much another. <br><br><h3>  Why State of JS? </h3><br>  This is the first survey responded by exclusively developers who deal with JavaScript.  It was organized by Sasha Grafe and his assistants in 2016.  Now enjoys great respect from the target audience.  There are other equally popular polls - from Stack Overflow (more than 100 thousand respondents) or from JetBrains (more than 6 thousand respondents).  Nevertheless, today we will focus on a survey from State of JS - also because it has no equal in the beauty of visualization. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ww/ly/_o/wwly_osytxkx9jkjirwsxqldpue.gif"><br><br><h4>  Part 1. Front-end frameworks </h4><br>  We live in an era of components, and this applies not only to the frontend.  Tools such as <a href="https://github.com/teambit/bit">Bit are</a> growing in popularity, making it easy to share components, reuse them, and create new applications faster, <a href="https://blog.bitsrc.io/solid-principles-every-developer-should-know-b3bfa96bb688">bringing them together</a> and synchronizing with other projects.  The future is definitely component-oriented platforms. <br><br>  There will be considered frameworks for front-end development in the order of the most demanded - due to its availability, as well as the pleasure and ease of work. <br><br>  <b>1. React</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/fh/ga/br/fhgabrms-zamfcii8zmlaiejlgq.jpeg"><br><br>  React (more than 110 thousand stars on GitHub) is an efficient and flexible declarative JavaScript library for building UI from the Facebook team.  It allows you to effortlessly create an interactive user interface.  React does not just support building object-centric applications ‚Äî it encourages it.  In addition, the creators of the framework took backward compatibility very seriously, so you can be sure about the longevity of your application.  The graph above clearly shows that in the past few years, the level of awareness of React has increased significantly.  That is why the library will be an excellent starting point for your trip to front-end development. <br><br>  <i>React developers are one of the highest paid javascript developers in 2018.</i> <br><br>  You can create a new application on React using the create-react-app toolchain designed for this purpose, currently the most popular existing one.  To start working with it, run the following lines in the command line of the project folder: <br><br><pre><code class="javascript hljs">npm create-react-app my-app cd my-app npm start</code> </pre> <br>  <b>2. Vue</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/do/nz/gk/donzgklhpji1pt4qkc7-g6d-k5s.jpeg"><br><br>  Vue.js, a progressive framework for building user interfaces, created by Evan Yu and 234 other enthusiasts, scored more than 121 thousand stars on GitHub.  It includes an accessible root library, which primarily solves the tasks of the presentation level, and an ecosystem of additional libraries that allows you to create complex and three-dimensional single-page applications. <br><br>  <i>Vue.js is pronounced exactly as the word view ("presentation") and has 4,000 GitHub stars more than React.</i> <br><br>  As you can see on the graph, Vue managed to jump over the marketing abyss: almost every developer heard about it.  It can be assumed that this was due to the tremendous efforts that Evan and his team have been applying since 2017, attending various meetings and conferences, as well as organizing their own.  However, a developer‚Äôs knowledge gap still exists, and in order to close it, in 2019 you need to create more training materials on working with Vue.js.  Install this framework using npm: <br><br><pre> <code class="javascript hljs">npm install vue</code> </pre> <br>  <b>3. Angular</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/yc/wx/ql/ycwxql7fzdjd3qsyqvo4knc0cgc.jpeg"><br><br>  Angular is a Google framework that has received almost 44,000 stars on GitHub.  It is a platform that simplifies the assembly of applications on the web.  Angular combines declarative patterns, dependency injection, two-way data binding, and best practices for solving development problems.  This platform allows you to build applications for the web, mobile devices and desktops.  It offers the most user-friendly command-line interface (CLI) and even the console (Console), a client with a graphical interface. <br><br>  Looking at the graph, you can see a huge difference compared to the graphs of the frameworks described above.  The point is that the data are biased because of the wording of the questions, which excludes AngularJS - a framework independent of Angular.  That is why this visualization is better not to take into account.  To install CLI using npm, open a command prompt or console window and enter the following command: <br><br><pre> <code class="javascript hljs">npm install -g @angular/cli</code> </pre> <br><h4>  Part 2. Framework for working with data </h4><br>  In this part we will look at data transfer and management technologies. <br><br>  <b>1. Redux</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/zs/wg/rn/zswgrnoqucfho8fg8wkohiwj4ns.jpeg"><br><br>  Redux, who collected 45 thousand stars on GitHub, is a predictable state container for javascript applications.  It helps to write stable behavior applications that run on the client, server and in the native environment and are easily tested.  Redux can be used with React or any other library for presentation. <br><br>  On the graph, you can observe the same trends in brand awareness as in the case of Vue: almost every javascript developer has heard about Redux.  However, some of them complain about the complexity of working with this framework, therefore, in order to make it more attractive for developers, and concepts are more accessible, more training materials are required.  To install, use the following command: <br><br><pre> <code class="javascript hljs">npm install ‚Äî save redux</code> </pre> <br>  <b>2. GraphQL</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/d_/i4/t8/d_i4t8pibib0ak1-3vxty0mk3rs.jpeg"><br><br>  GraphQL from Facebook with a rating on GitHub of more than 10 thousand stars is a language for formulating requests to the API (application programming interface) and the environment for executing these requests using existing data.  With it, you can provide a complete and understandable description of the data in the API, allowing customers to request only what they need and nothing more.  Due to this, over time, it becomes easier to develop software application interfaces and use powerful development tools. <br><br>  Of course, in 2019 there will be a market niche for materials on working with GraphQL, because many people are interested in studying it.  In addition, the graph shows that the lack of brand awareness in 2018 was almost completely eliminated.  To install GraphQL, use npm: <br><br><pre> <code class="javascript hljs">npm install graphql</code> </pre> <br>  <b>3. Apollo</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/je/mh/zn/jemhznnhfblkiybsvyl8hdnnrmu.jpeg"><br><br>  Apollo platform is a GraphQL implementation that allows you to send data from the cloud to the UI.  It is suitable for gradual implementation and can act as an additional layer for already existing services, including API and databases, built with REST into account.  In addition to the developer‚Äôs toolbox, which provides everything to confidently launch the graph API, Apollo includes two open source libraries for the client and for the server. <br><br>  The graph above shows how much brand awareness has increased and how much more needs to be done in this area.  It is also seen that almost everyone who has tried Apollo is ready to use it again.  However, it would not hurt to add new training materials in order to make the platform more successful in 2019.  To install, use npm: <br><br><pre> <code class="javascript hljs"><span class="hljs-comment"><span class="hljs-comment">// installing the preset package npm install apollo-boost graphql-tag graphql --save // installing each piece independently npm install apollo-client apollo-cache-inmemory apollo-link-http graphql-tag graphql --save</span></span></code> </pre> <br><h4>  Part 3. Framework for backend development </h4><br>  In this area without any special changes: Express is still ahead - no other backend framework could please the developers to the same extent. <br><br>  <b>1. Express</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/y2/e8/vw/y2e8vw12gwf42b3r5o0holdn7ny.jpeg"><br><br>  The owner of more than 41 thousand stars on GitHub, Express is a high-speed, flexible and minimalistic web framework for Node.js applications. <br><br>  In 2018, Express coped with its tasks brilliantly: it not only retained its leadership status, but also left its competitors far behind.  When working with JavaScript in the backend of the application, choose it, and you will not lose.  To install, use npm: <br><br><pre> <code class="javascript hljs">npm install express ‚Äî save</code> </pre> <br>  <b>2. Next js</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/m9/mg/zw/m9mgzwd_unt7wxnlm0cxd7oiabs.jpeg"><br><br>  Although there was not enough data to visualize growth during the existence of Next, we can still say that this backend framework had a good year, which made it the most popular after Express. <br><br>  Next, received more than 32 thousand stars on GitHub, gives developers the opportunity to start easily, because it uses React for templates.  Developers with experience in React using Next can achieve quick results.  To install, use npm: <br><br><pre> <code class="javascript hljs">npm install --save next react react-dom</code> </pre> <br>  <b>3. Koa</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/gr/i0/wu/gri0wucfoh0u_exf5hmau-0zl_s.jpeg"><br><br>  Over the past year, Koa's popularity has grown, although it seems that the level of developer satisfaction with this framework has not changed, because Express is still leading.  However, looking at the graphics of other backend frameworks (for example, Meteor), one can say that Koa's business is not bad - and can be even better. <br><br>  This new web framework, which gained more than 24 thousand stars on GitHub, was created by the same team as Express, as a less cumbersome, more expressive and reliable platform for web applications and APIs.  Using the tools of asynchronous programming, Koa allows you to abandon the callback-functions and many times more efficiently handle errors.  The Koa core does not build middleware.  This framework has a set of first-class techniques that make writing servers a quick and enjoyable experience.  To install, use npm: <br><br><pre> <code class="javascript hljs">npm install koa</code> </pre> <br><h4>  Links </h4><br><ul><li>  All images and visual data are taken from the <a href="https://2018.stateofjs.com/">official</a> State of JavaScript <a href="https://2018.stateofjs.com/">web site</a> . </li><li>  More information about the biased data on Angular is available <a href="https://ilikekillnerds.com/2018/11/the-state-of-js-survey-is-a-farce/">here</a> .  And <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DUnEPBQvkNrg%26feature%3Dyoutu.be">here</a> you can see the analysis of the survey. </li><li>  Some data from the Stack Overflow survey is available <a href="https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2018/">here</a> . </li><li>  Some data from the JetBrains survey are available <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/research/devecosystem-2018/javascript/">here</a> . </li></ul><br><h3>  Conclusion </h3><br>  We looked at the javascript frameworks that were most in demand among developers in the outgoing year and will remain so next.  If you are a beginner, it is important to try everything in search of the most popular.  It is equally important for teachers and authors of articles to know what resources are not enough to fill these gaps.  Happy New Code, and feel free to leave comments!  :) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/433926/">https://habr.com/ru/post/433926/</a></p>
