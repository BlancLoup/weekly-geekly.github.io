Since Parking.ru has been hosting Windows for more than 10 years, we try to listen to our users and often receive complaints about the slow work of such a ‚Äúheavy‚Äù CMS as 1C-Bitrix on a shared hosting and as it turned out later on VDS. <br><br>  And we had the idea to create a ‚Äúperfect‚Äù image of a Hyper-V virtual machine that would include an operating system already configured for specific CMS, a database, a web server and all this with selected VDS performance parameters so that users can simply buy a ready-made solution out of the box "And immediately get a quick system. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  For a start, we set up 1C-Bitrix PHP without settings on a fresh virtual user from our HyperHalf 512MB RAM tariff plan and frankly we were not pleased with the result of running PHP on Windows.  After a series of tests built into Bitrix, we got the following picture:

We contacted Microsoft and they advised us to try to use, instead of Zend`a, a new WinCache development designed to cache PHP code under Windows. <br>  At the time of optimization, it was not very stable, but thanks to the operational release of new builds that took into account our bug reports, it was possible to achieve more stable work.  As a result of tests, we have a sharp increase in performance. <br>  But in the final version, we still included Zend, this was due to the fact that WinCache does not know how to work with the encoded trial version of Bitrix (in versions for Joomla! Where there is no coding we will use WinCache since it gives the best results) <br><br>  Well, we decided to finalize with our partners from 1C-Bitrix, whom we have known and are friends for a long time, thanks to them we managed to refine the configuration to the ideal and get the following result: <br><img src="http://www.parking.ru/images/btestwin.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  With the reference 30 points set for the speed of the CMS core, a value of 35 on the lowest tariff plan is more than worthy, and considering the special price for HyperCMS on Windows, this is generally excellent. <br><br>  Now we, together with the developers, are actively working on optimizing several more CMS that will appear in the list of available soon - this is UMI.CMS and Joomla !, and a little later WordPress and a number of other PHP and .NET technologies built as well. <br><br>  UPD: We are not stopping the optimization work and will update the images and configurations for <a href="http://www.parking.ru/hypercms.asp">HyperCMS</a> tariffs with the release of new versions of CMS and server components. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/83912/">https://habr.com/ru/post/83912/</a></p>
