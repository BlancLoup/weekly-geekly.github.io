Do not chase after money, power and status</strong> .  Of course, it's great when you have it all.  But one should not continuously think only about incomes and social status - one also has to live. <br><br>  <strong>2. Spend as much time as you need on what matters most to you</strong> .  Personal success in our consciousness and is not measured by money, Ponte and the attention of the crowd.  Often, a person takes all the time to build a career, create a business, earn a lot of money, and there is absolutely no time for what really matters, what you like and want.  Many realize it too late.

      <strong>3. Do not make your choice based on other people's opinions</strong> .  It's not about ignoring any statements of others - I say that you need to listen to them, but make decisions yourself. <br><br>  <strong>4. Stay true to yourself</strong> .  This means that you always have to do what really matters to you. <br><br>  <strong>5. Think not only about money</strong> .  Yes, it is quite possible to do something that is not significant for you, just for the sake of money.  But does this make sense?  If only money is important to you - maybe yes, it makes sense.  Work on something important for you always gives a surge of vitality.  But the choice is yours. <br><br>  <strong>6. Be infinitely greedy - to knowledge</strong> .  You can hardly fill your creation with information and ideas - good brains will never be superfluous.  Nor is it necessary to spend money on expensive training ‚Äî self-education can make you a genius. <br><br>  <strong>7. Make friends with failures</strong> .  You will definitely fail from time to time - and the more failures, the more ambitious your goals.  People who never lose, simply do not risk and never set ambitious goals.  You can be friends with failures, getting invaluable lessons from them - and this is a sure way for quick success. <br><br>  <strong>8. Do not repeat your mistakes</strong> .  If you make a mistake twice, it means that you did not learn any lessons from your first failure and she did not teach you anything.  Making new mistakes means moving.  A loser - one who constantly makes the same mistakes, is marking time. <br><br>  <strong>9. Communicate frequently with the right people</strong> .  These are not necessarily rich and powerful personalities: more time should be spent with those from whom you can learn a lot, who enjoy life.  These are people who do what they love and love what they do.  Look for them everywhere, listen to them. <br><br>  <strong>10. Drop everything that contradicts the above principles</strong> .  So, give up any activity that does not bring you closer to your values, does not teach anything, just burns time.  And even more so stop communicating with people who are pulling you back.  Sometimes you have to be ruthless.  But each of us has only one life. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/12138/">https://habr.com/ru/post/12138/</a></p>
