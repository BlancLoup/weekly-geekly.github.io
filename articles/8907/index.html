  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Apple intends to begin selling the iPhone in Russia in the fall of 2007.</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  This was reported to CNews by a source in the Russian partner of an American vendor.  According to experts, this decision Apple is associated with the fear of missing the market, which is already beginning to enter the device competitors. <br><br>  As a source close to Apple IMC told CNews, the Apple iPhone mobile phone will go on sale in Russia in September-October 2007. ‚ÄúThe sales channel has not yet been determined, but most likely it will be federal networks - Euroset, Svyaznoy "," Dixis "and others. Earlier, we recall, about the Russian premiere of the" apple "phone talked very vaguely.  His appearance was not expected before 2008. <br><br>  According to market participants, delaying the release of the iPhone may result in Apple losing the potential audience in favor of other vendors.  ‚ÄúPerhaps, the acceleration of the phone release on the Russian market is connected with the company's desire to make money on the pre-New Year sales,‚Äù said Ochir Mandzhikov, press secretary of Euroset.  - It is no secret that almost all vendors bring some successful new products to the market in the autumn.  It is also possible that this is connected with the launch of touch-screen phones from Samsung and LG, which some people were quick to compare with the iPhone. ‚Äù

      Dmitry Khavzhu, director of Makcentr, adheres to a similar point of view: ‚ÄúEvery extra month of delay with entering the Russian market reduces the device‚Äôs chances.  The fact that it seems to be a masterpiece now will look much more pale at the end of the year, so I consider the rumors of an earlier iPhone release quite reliable. ‚Äù <br><br>  However, in the company Apple IMC, representing the American vendor in the Russian market, information about the imminent appearance of the iPhone is not confirmed.  ‚ÄúI can state with full responsibility that there is not a single person in Russia and Europe who knows when the iPhone will appear in Russia,‚Äù said Evgeny Butman, CEO of the company. <br><br>  According to experts polled by CNews, the release of the phone ahead of schedule, if it takes place, will not mean an absolute victory for Apple over its competitors.  ‚ÄúThe prospects for the iPhone in Russia are highly dependent on Apple‚Äôs efforts in this direction,‚Äù says Dmitry Khavzhu.  - If Apple wants to sell 50 thousand devices a year - nothing needs to be done for this, everything will happen by itself.  If you want to sell 500 thousand devices, then you need to work a lot and seriously: prepare a product for the Russian market, think about porting third-party programs to a new operating system for them, get partners interested, do marketing, finally. ‚Äù  Euroset also believes that there is no reason to expect a large demand for the iPhone ‚Äúdue to Apple‚Äôs absolutely non-transparent distribution policy in Russia, inadequate pricing and modesty of advertising and marketing initiatives.‚Äù <br><br>  Note: the official announcement of the Apple iPhone phone took place in early January 2007. The mobile phone operating in GSM / GPRS / EDGE networks incorporates all the functions of modern handheld digital devices, from the camera to the MP3 player.  The camera has a resolution of 2 MP, the amount of memory can be from 4 to 8 GB.  The size of the diagonal display - 3.5 inches.  The iPhone lacks the traditional keyboard, which functions as a touchscreen display.  In addition, among the features of the phone - support for a number of wireless data transmission standards - Wi-Fi (802.11b / g), EDGE and Bluetooth 2.0.  The overall dimensions of the Apple iPhone are 115 x 61 x 11.6 mm, weight - 135 grams.  US residents will be the first to see the phone in stores - here it will start being sold on June 11, 2007. In 2008, the company intends to sell about 10 million phones, having occupied about 1% of the world market by that time. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/8907/">https://habr.com/ru/post/8907/</a></p>
