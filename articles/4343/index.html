For them, this is a new tool, potentially very effective.  Marketers gradually master it and publish the first <a href="http://rohitbhargava.typepad.com/weblog/2006/08/5_rules_of_soci.html">guide to SMO</a> , that is, optimization for social media. <br><br>  Over the years the existence of search engine optimization, it has turned into a whole science, which borders on art.  The goal of SEO is to raise the site as high as possible in the search results of a particular search engine.  On the other hand, SMO aims to attract an audience to the site through social networks, blogs, podcasts, video casts and specialized search engines, that is, to integrate as much as possible into the blogosphere and social networks in order to get traffic from there.  This requires special methods. <br><br>  1. Increase <b>linkability</b> .  This is the first and most important rule for websites.  Many sites still remain static, that is, they are rarely updated and are used as if as a showcase.  On such a site will not put links.  Increasing linkability implies just the constant generation of interesting content, which will be consistently referenced in the blogosphere and social media.  There are different ways: you can open a corporate blog site, publish some research or other interesting documents, or just make an interesting selection of someone else's content.

      2. To facilitate the <b>assignment of tags and the creation of bookmarks</b> for your site, that is, you need to place special links like ‚ÄúAdd to Bloglines‚Äù so that the RSS feed or link is added there with one click of a button.  In addition, additional steps need to be taken to ensure that the page is associated with relevant tags. <br><br>  3. Encourage <b>inbound links</b> .  Since incoming links are critical for site promotion, you need to pay special attention to them and encourage those who put them.  For example, to list all the pages where these links appeared. <br><br>  4. Ensure the <b>export of content</b> .  It is not only about text information in the form of RSS, but also about the export of various files, including PDF, video, audio.  You need to try to distribute your files as widely as possible on the Internet.  Naturally, they should link to the parent site. <br><br>  5. Encourage <b>hybrids</b> based on your content.  In the modern Internet, many services are created on the basis of other services.  Do not hesitate to open your content so that it can be made part of another site.  This will only add traffic. <br><br>  6. <b>Serve the people</b> , even if it does not make money.  Publish useful information for users and put outgoing links to other useful sites, including those of competitors.  In this case, you will be bookmarked and marked as an objective and universal source of information in this area. <br><br>  7. Identify and promote <b>valuable users of</b> your community.  For example, specifically to attract traffic to them from the main page of your site, give them personal attention signs, introduce a rating system so that these people get a higher status in the system. <br><br>  8. Participate in the life of the community. <br><br>  9. Address exactly to your target audience. <br><br>  10. Create as much content as possible. <br><br>  11. Be as honest as possible. <br><br>  12. Do not be afraid of new technologies. <br><br>  The list of new SMO rules is gradually increasing and has already been expanded to 16 points, and also translated into several languages.  In fact, we are creating a whole guide to Marketing 2.0. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/4343/">https://habr.com/ru/post/4343/</a></p>
