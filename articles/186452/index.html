  <section class="page js-page"><h1>What would you do if ...?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Friends. <br><br>  I am a programmer with quite a lot of experience.  My passion for computers went back to school when, in 1998, I got my first Pentium.  Since then, I have firmly decided that I will write programs, which I still do today. <br><br>  However, recently a strange question came to my mind that, perhaps, could have come to many of you.  I asked it to almost all my friends to programmers, and some of them made him think pretty hard for a long time.  Today is Friday, the day when you can relax a bit and think about the eternal, so I want to ask you the same question.

      So: <b>What would you do if you were told today that you can never do what you are doing now?</b>  Initially this question was about programming, but since the audience of the habr is much wider, I decided to generalize. <br><br>  I will explain a little conditions.  Suppose you are a programmer.  And so, for some reason, you can no longer do this.  Absolutely no matter why.  This could be an evil rock, an unknown virus, an accident or religious beliefs.  Just can not be all.  Nowhere and never.  No  What would you start doing this?  In this case, the choice of activities is not limited.  You can, if you want, stay in IT (become, for example, a tester).  Or go to sell the pies in the stall.  Or dance (provided that you know how or will learn).  But the answer must necessarily be in view of your real possibilities, i.e.  If you do not have a hearing, then you can not answer "I will be an opera singer."  And yes, it should bring you money. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>  I'll start with myself.  For me to answer this question is not easy.  Perhaps I would become a writer.  I have a love for printed texts since childhood.  It is much easier for me to express thoughts on paper than in conversation.  And to write some small essay is not a problem for me, I like it.  I would try writing a novel.  Most likely fiction, although this is how it goes.  I would also study.  I already had this experience, I like to transfer knowledge.  And in the absence of a programmer‚Äôs work, enough time would be freed up to deal with it seriously.  Here, perhaps, are two of the main directions in which I would go. <br><br>  Now you.  Please write in the comments <b>who you are now, how much you are doing it, and who you would become</b> if this happened to you. <br><br>  PS Not very sure with the choice of hubs.  Advise something more suitable, if there is? <br>  PPS If for some reason you want to lower my karma, before that write at least in a personal or in a comment, why so.  It is important for me to know. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/186452/">https://habr.com/ru/post/186452/</a></p>
