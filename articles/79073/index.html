  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Peer Generation</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  This is more a confession than an objective article.  Judge as it is. <br><br>  Much has been said about Internet addiction in the early days of the Internet.  Today, many consider themselves vaccinated against this scourge, although it is often not the case.  Now being on-line is the norm and an integral part of the high-tech culture.  But it all depends on the person. <a name="habracut"></a>  . <br><br>  When I brought home the Internet, I did it for specific purposes.  Learn, get information, write articles and make money.  Aha :) In two years, I downloaded about 500 films, 20,000 books and tons of software.  How many times have I looked and read?  Right :)

      I looked like a child with two cakes in his hands when he was given the third, fourth, and fifth on the way.  I put in reserve for the future, descendants ... <br><br>  I think it's time to stop it.  Lost goal, then you need to re-find it or invent it.  I couldn‚Äôt think of a better way to put brains in order than writing an article about this article.  First you need to deal with this problem, to understand its essence, and then you can write about something else. <br><br>  How does addiction arise.  Imagine this situation.  A person needs specific information to achieve a specific goal.  He goes to the library and finds it.  ‚ÄúPlus one in the library's karma,‚Äù he thinks.  Next time for information he will go to the same library.  And, if his expectations are met three times, he will continue to walk even if he cannot find what he is looking for.  On the scales comes the choice - to go to an unknown distance behind the right book or stay here and look for something else.  The tool becomes an end in itself.  The circle is closed. <br><br>  Here is another example.  If the grasshopper is lowered into the jar and the jar is closed with a lid, it will jump 2-3 times and stop.  Even if you open the lid.  What do you think will happen if a person turns out to be a grasshopper?  Right.  He will beat his head until the end of his days until his forehead breaks. <br><br>  For two years of life on-line, I have done very little.  The knowledge gained during the surfing has nowhere to apply so that they grow into experience.  They are still dead weight. <br><br>  I translated the long article ‚Äú <a href="http://amiwho.habrahabr.ru/blog/31652/">Does Google Make Us Stupid?</a> ‚Äù But I never read it myself from beginning to end.  Reason jumps and refuses to think.  The thread of judgment was lost at the beginning, and you are already thinking about your work, but by inertia, continuing to slide your eyes along the lines, choking and floundering on the surface of meaning. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/79073/">https://habr.com/ru/post/79073/</a></p>
