The remaining 89% either do not use cash at all, or use cashless payment methods more often, and the cache is rarely used. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Among the reasons for the refusal of cash payments are the convenience of non-cash payment, unwillingness to withdraw money from the card, the opportunity to receive cashback or discount.  Those paying non-cash, most often use bank cards - 94% of respondents, 40% - mobile bank, 16% - electronic money.  There are those who pay with a smartphone or for hours. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/8o/q7/sj/8oq7sjaszcclv9wgf9m505jix1s.jpeg">

    <h3>  Investments in fintech </h3><br>  <a href="https://www.pwc.ru/ru/publications/assets/moneytree_final.pdf">An overview of the</a> venture capital industry in Russia for 2017 shows that investments in Fintech are constantly growing.  So, in 2016, the technology sub-sector in the financial sector ranked second in terms of investment - then $ 15 million was invested. In 2017, this figure doubled, reaching $ 30.8 million, which is 15% of the total investment. <br><br>  Until 2018, there is no data yet, but we can expect a further increase in investment - the industry is gaining momentum, and investors see it. <br><br><h3>  Tax on self-employed </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/w0/ec/7z/w0ec7zf2l8xcmirmfhzoxrbf0io.jpeg"><br><br>  From 2019, officials plan to conduct a new experiment - to introduce a tax on professional income for self-employed citizens.  The draft law on the new special regime is <a href="http://sozd.duma.gov.ru/bill/551845-7">already being considered by the</a> State Duma.  It is reported that individuals will pay the tax who do not have an employer and who do not attract employees under labor contracts.  It can be translators, tutors, nannies.  It is not necessary to register as individual entrepreneurs. <br><br>  The experiment will be conducted from 2019 to 2028 in four regions at once: Moscow, Moscow and Kaluga regions, the Republic of Tatarstan.  It should be noted that it is impossible to pay tax on professional income for self-employed citizens if the income of physical persons for a calendar year exceeds 2.4 million rubles. <br><br><h3>  Institutional investors and cryptocurrencies </h3><br>  <a href="https://www.rbc.ru/crypto/news/5be3fce09a794757f35d77e8">The report, which was published by</a> Morgan Stanley, shows that institutional investors are increasingly active in the world of Bitcoin and cryptocurrency.  The report is so rosy that the authors of the report even called the cryptocurrency ‚Äúa gold mine for institutional investors.‚Äù  As evidence, experts cite statistics.  So, from the beginning of 2016, the funds invested in cryptoactive assets increase to $ 7.11 billion. This type of activity is characteristic of hedge funds, private investment companies, and venture capital. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/_e/t-/t8/_et-t8y0-kddmgp6xnobx1awjbi.jpeg"><br><br>  The main type of assets in this type of investment is Bitcoin, it has gone from a currency for geeks to a global product that is interesting to everyone. <br><br><h3>  Cryptocurrency Law in Russia </h3><br>  Finally, the State Duma plans to pass laws on cryptocurrencies and related elements by the end of this year.  In March, three bills were immediately introduced, which are designed to create regulation in the field of the digital economy.  According to the chairman of the Duma Committee on the Financial Market, Anatoly Aksakov, the laws need to prescribe only ‚Äúdigital rights that individuals can acquire, and only individual entrepreneurs and legal entities can issue tokens‚Äù. <br><br><blockquote>  Until we come to a common denominator.  Until the end of the year we plan to adopt, I expect that this year we will pass laws </blockquote>  - <a href="https://rg.ru/2018/11/07/gosduma-namerena-opredelit-status-kriptovaliut-v-rf-do-konca-goda.html">declared</a> Aksakov. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/430568/">https://habr.com/ru/post/430568/</a></p>
