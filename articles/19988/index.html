      Many people do not need more: they have a hobby for creativity, and an excess of energy can be spent on your family.  If you are such a person, then the continuation of the article is unlikely to have practical value for you. <br><br>  <b>Selling your software product to end users</b> <br><br>  Today, the Internet is full of programs for almost every taste, and potential buyers have become picky and have learned how to use search engines.  Therefore, a program that is ‚Äúknit on the knee‚Äù is unlikely to bring at least some money to its author. <br><br>  In addition, software companies that have managed to achieve at least some financial success (for example, to achieve payback and pay off creditors), attract to their product the audience mainly from search engines, because  for more few people have enough money.  They do this through SEO or AdWords - not so important.  It is important that the cost of attracting the first users to your product has long been not zero. <br><br>  ‚ÄúMake a simple website, put your program on it, and Google will do the rest for you‚Äù - this scheme is no longer working, unfortunately. <br><br>  The situation with shareware archives of the type <a href="http://www.download.com/">download.com is</a> no less regrettable.  Today they bring us very few people and almost no sales.  Why?  Because people are looking for solutions for their tasks in Google.  And if nothing is found there (it happens, but not often), then they go to the shareware archive. <br><br>  <b>Provision of service</b> <br><br>  In order to successfully work under this scheme, you need to be able to do your job at a good level.  For this reason, it seems to me reasonable to go on an independent voyage only if you have at least one year's experience in your profession. <br><br>  It is very easy to find customers for your service even if you do not participate in <a href="http://www.isdef.org/">ISDEF</a> and similar meetings of charmers.  Today, there are a lot of services in RuNet, the only purpose of which is to share the customer with the contractor for a small share.  For example: <a href="http://www.free-lance.ru/">free-lance.ru</a> <br><br>  Using the services of a freelance worker is often more beneficial for the client company than hiring an employee on an ongoing basis.  After all, the freelancer does not need a separate workplace in the office, equipped with a computer, it is not necessary to feed him lunch every day and most importantly: his salary does not appear in the financial statements for the tax inspection!  Customer benefit is especially evident when solving one-off tasks, such as, for example, setting up a web server, making a flash presentation or developing corporate style. <br><br>  The alignment so attractive to the customer gives the freelancer the opportunity to ask for their services a little more than he could expect, doing the same on a permanent job. <br><br>  So my advice to you, dear, if you decide to find a new use for yourself - think about freelancing! <br></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/19988/">https://habr.com/ru/post/19988/</a></p>
