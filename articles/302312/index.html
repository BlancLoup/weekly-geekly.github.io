On this day, our speaker was mainly Joseph McClendon III, and Tony Robbins only appeared on video.  Unfortunately, Tony was present only on the first and third days of the event, and the second and fourth days of the show were led by Joseph McClendon III.  However, everything is fine: Joseph is also an amazing speaker, not inferior to Tony.

      <b>‚ÄúFree Your Inner Power‚Äù, Day 2: Turning dreams into reality</b> <br><br>  Before moving on to the materials and the bright lessons of the second day, ‚ÄúFree your inner strength,‚Äù watch the video I recorded that morning.  As you can see, my voice from yesterday evening has not yet recovered. <br><br>  Here is a minute video: <br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/5Old3LyYYVY%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=25657,15700022,15700186,15700191,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhjWjDe3MxIfHq8pROSzaKmvKh7fHA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  Energy 5000+ participants on the first day was great.  And all of this peak mood was preserved until the next morning, especially thanks to the evening "walk on the fire."  One of the first things that Joseph McClendon III taught us was the "Formula for Ultimate Success." <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0071c5">Formula for ultimate success</font> </h2><br><br><h3>  <font color="#0071c5">1) Know your goal</font> </h3><br>  If you want to <a href="http://blog.mbaconsult.ru/blog/personal/kak-sozdat-kontseptsiyu-razvitiya-sobstvennoy-zhizni/">achieve something in life</a> , you need to know what the result or goal is to <a href="http://blog.mbaconsult.ru/blog/personal/kak-sozdat-kontseptsiyu-razvitiya-sobstvennoy-zhizni/">achieve</a> .  The more specifics in your definition, the higher the probability of obtaining the desired.  Strength is exactly. <br><br><h3>  <font color="#0071c5">2) Understand why you need it.</font> </h3><br>  Having dealt with your goal, you need to find out WHY you want it.  First the reasons, then the answers. <br><br>  You must do what you strive for, MANDATORY, so that you are absolutely serious about achieving what.  Good reasons are fuel and momentum that force you to do what leads to the desired outcome. <br><br><h3>  <font color="#0071c5">3) Take large-scale actions.</font> </h3><br>  Realizing what you want and why you need it, you have to take the next step - go to <a href="http://blog.mbaconsult.ru/blog/personal/21-sovet-pozvolyayushchiy-prevratitsya-v-samogo-produktivnogo-cheloveka/">GRAND OPERATIONS</a> .  Not minor matters, but it is SCALE ACTS.  You need to create an action plan and execute it. <br><br><h3>  <font color="#0071c5">4) Stay on top of your achievements.</font> </h3><br>  When taking large-scale actions, you need to pay attention to what you get from them.  It is very important sharpness of feelings.  Are you moving towards your goal?  Are you approaching or moving away from her?  Does what you do work? <br><br><h3>  <font color="#0071c5">5) Change your approach</font> </h3><br>  What if what you do is not working?  Change tactics.  What if everything is wrong again?  Change the approach again.  The key is to change methods up to and fro until you get what you want. <br><br>  This is what most successful people do, from Thomas Edison, who invents the light bulb, to Colonel Sanders, who sells his chicken dishes. <br><br>  Another of the important lessons from Joseph McClendon III in the previous video is the power of binding. <br><br>  The truth is that we are all <a href="http://testutor.ru/blog/dvenadcat-sposobov-perestat-otnositsya-k-sebe-slishkom-surovo/">TOO surah for</a> our <a href="http://testutor.ru/blog/dvenadcat-sposobov-perestat-otnositsya-k-sebe-slishkom-surovo/">selves</a> . <br><br>  We praise ourselves a little and do not pay tribute to ourselves.  The basis of the formation of habits or behavior - fastening.  The more actively we reward ourselves for the right actions, the higher the likelihood that we will repeat them. <br><br>  By simply encouraging yourself ‚Äî by stroking yourself on the shoulder, smiling at your own reflection, or acknowledging your own merits ‚Äî you bring yourself pleasure that is associated with behavior. <br>  <b>What is awarded is repeated!</b> <br><br>  Joseph says there are 2 main ways to condition something. <br><br>  1) Repetition <br>  2) Praise <br><br>  Repetition is the mother of skill, praise is his father. <br><br>  One of the most vivid impressions of the second day of the seminar ‚ÄúFree your inner strength‚Äù is connected with participation in the procedure called ‚ÄúDriving Force: Theory about Impulse‚Äù. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/437/eff/fee/437efffee28e41719e068160aa1d0c85.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The proposed picture is a diagram from the training manual with ‚ÄúFree internal force‚Äù.  As you can see, there are 5 steps to controlling the impulse.  Below I will tell you more about them. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0071c5">Your driving force: the theory of impulse</font> </h2><br><h3>  <font color="#0071c5">STEP 1: Create a peak mood</font> </h3><br>  I have already spoken about the emotional state in the review of the first day of the seminar.  Before you take on something, you definitely need to be in high spirits.  This is explained by the fact that the decisions you make will depend on your attitude, and whether or not you all follow through. <br><br>  You can change your state by adjusting your physiological indicators, focus and language patterns. <br><br><h3>  <font color="#0071c5">STEP 2: Find your passion!</font> </h3><br>  Then you need to open your passion and find the "fuel" that will be the basis of the movement.  Do this by asking yourself the following questions: <br><ul><li>  That I love? </li><li>  What do i hate? </li><li>  What am I fond of? </li><li>  What do I really want? </li><li>  What really turns me on in life? </li></ul><br>  These questions will help you identify your <a href="http://blog.mbaconsult.ru/blog/education/pochemu-opisaniya-prioritetov-i-tsennostey-imeyut-znachenie/">core values</a> and reveal your passion. <br><br><h3>  <font color="#0071c5">STEP 3: Make a decision, make a commitment and secure it!</font> </h3><br>  After you are in the right condition and have released your mania, the next step is DECISION and COMMITMENT. <br><blockquote>  Your fate is formed precisely in the moments of decision-making ... </blockquote><br>  Tony robbins <br><br>  To do this, we ask ourselves 2 primary questions. <br><ol><li>  What are the 2 decisions that I made in the past, well influenced my life?  How have they changed my life for the better?  What led me to them? </li><li>  What 2 decisions do I have to make now?  How much they will improve my life forever? </li></ol><br>  The formation of a mood for the adoption of a new, expanding solution was for me a very bright moment. <br><br>  When you make a decision, being in a state of absolute CONFIDENCE, it becomes an OBLIGATION.  All decisions must be made in a peak mood, otherwise in the long run you are unlikely to bring the matter to the end. <br><br><h3>  <font color="#0071c5">STEP 4: Take reasonable, consistent, and large-scale actions immediately!</font> </h3><br>  After making a decision, serious action is needed.  Well-considered grandiose actions can be a panacea. <br><br>  Here are some key strategies that allow you to act effectively: <br><ul><li>  find a role model </li><li>  take a proven model (or create it) </li><li>  make a plan </li><li>  do something immediately so as not to lose the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãa goal or <a href="http://blog.mbaconsult.ru/blog/personal/uroki-uspekha-i-produmannykh-resheniy/">decision made</a> . </li></ul><br><h3>  <font color="#0071c5">STEP 5: Be smart (SMART) - be honest with yourself</font> </h3><br>  Be sure to follow the SMART philosophy. Here is what it is: <br><br><ul><li>  Establish your decision.  ( <b>S</b> trengthen ...). </li><li>  More often analyze the situation!  ( <b>M</b> easure ...) </li><li>  Evaluate whether you are getting the desired emotional reward.  ( <b>A</b> ssess ...) </li><li>  Secure what works and take new action to save momentum.  ( <b>R</b> einforce ...) </li><li>  Move on!  ( <b>T</b> ake ...) </li></ul><br>  The second day brought a sea of ‚Äã‚Äãdelightful highlights!  Unfortunately, I can‚Äôt list them all as part of this review of the seminar ‚ÄúFree Inner Strength‚Äù.  But I will tell you about my favorite moment - an exercise called ‚ÄúPatching holes‚Äù. <br><br>  Continuation - <a href="http://blog.mbaconsult.ru/blog/personal/obzor-seminara-toni-robbinsa-osvobodite-vnutrennyuyu-silu-den-2-prevrashchenie-grez-v-realnost/">follows</a> . <br><br>  PS We recommend another article on the topic - <a href="http://blog.mbaconsult.ru/blog/personal/7-povodov-prinyat-izmeneniya/">7 reasons to accept the changes and become more successful</a> . <br><br>  Translated by Vyacheslav Davidenko, founder of <a href="http://www.mbaconsult.ru/">MBA Consult</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/302312/">https://habr.com/ru/post/302312/</a></p>
