  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Case in the ocean</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/ac8/8b6/389/ac88b6389114db55104c7106d83f5776.jpg"><br><br>  Personal long-term experience of reading various blogs and forums shows that, as a rule, negative articles are the most popular - criticism of unsuccessful decisions of some well-known company, shocking customer fraud stories, simply publicizing someone's mistakes in work ... In principle, it it is clear: only in the state of noble anger, the absolute majority of authors and commentators can show eloquence, aptly label the person responsible with a sharp word or, at worst, post in the comments a billion on  to facepalm (for which, to be honest, I would have given a life ban).  It is easier, it is more familiar, it has returned to normal.  As soon as a person sees some positive material, all eloquence and sparkling humor disappear instantly - there is no incentive, it is not interesting to praise. <br><br>  In principle, this phenomenon can be tried to explain by the fact that a blog or a forum is something like a polyclinic, where they go only in case of problems.  But as a result, the overall picture emerges very sad: everything around is bad, life consists only of negative.  But in reality this is not the case, and Habrahabr is one of the unique resources where the reader gets a positive charge much more often than a negative one.  And in such a way, from afar, I approached the actual theme of my post, which I just cannot help but publish for justice. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  I was lucky and I spent the New Year holidays 20,000 kilometers from the dank St. Petersburg winter on the islands lost in the Pacific Ocean, where there is often no Internet or stable mobile communication, and even electricity appears only for a few hours thanks to a gasoline generator.  But this is a separate story, about which I still plan to write a detailed report.  Now I want to talk about something else.

      Due to the nature of the work, I always keep on hand the ‚Äúhome‚Äù SIM card of the MTS operator, whose client I have been for many years.  Internet banking is also tied to my number, in general, I use international roaming, although this is not accepted in decent Russian society.  But I use it very ‚Äúgently‚Äù, only when it is really necessary, and mostly only SMS messages.  Here with them there was an unpleasant incident. <br><br>  It so happened that before the end of last year I had to send a certain amount through the Internet bank.  I found the Internet, but the confirmation code in the form of SMS messages on the phone did not come hard.  I had to call in person at the MTS support center and find out what the problem was.  Apparently, something worked wrong when sending SMS from short numbers to the subscriber in international roaming, I did not go into the technical details, but after 10 minutes I was able to send a bank transfer.  However, this was only the beginning of the story. <br><br>  As it turned out, on arrival home, none of my 46 SMS messages sent to friends and family on vacation days after transferring money via the Internet bank did not reach the recipients.  Yes, and I did not get any sent to me.  Apparently, as often happens, when one problem was fixed, a new one was created, while it was almost impossible to understand that something was not working: all technical SMS messages and responses to a request for balance remained fast and without failures. <br><br>  All this turned out to be at home.  I went the simplest way: I received the details of my mobile expenses, counted the costs and sent an email to MTS with the attached details and a detailed description of the unpleasant incident.  I did all this on Friday, January 18th.  After a couple of clarifying letters from MTS managers, yesterday, January 21, I received an apology from MTS, and I received a monetary compensation on my mobile phone balance, covering all expenses for SMS messages sent during the holidays.  In short, the main points: <br><br>  <b>The total cost of SMS messages sent from vacation is 740 rubles.</b> <b><br></b>  <b>The cost of telephone calls from international roaming to the MTS support center is 0 rub.</b> <b><br></b>  <b>The timeline for the consideration of my complaint by the MTS staff is 2 business days.</b> <b><br></b>  <b>The amount of compensation received on the balance of the phone - 1000 rubles</b> <br><br>  In general, everything was decided quickly, efficiently, and this solution completely suited me as an MTS client. <br><br>  Of course, there are and there will be a lot of shortcomings in the work of mobile operators, which can and should be pointed out to us, vigilant subscribers, but at the same time I considered it necessary to publicly express my gratitude to my operator, because positive feedback stimulates no less (and maybe more) than negative.  By the way, managers Irina Lukashina and Tatyana Gerasimova worked with me.  They are personal thanks. <br><br>  PS By the way, but in the Korean Incheon International Airport and the hotels closest to it, even international roaming did not help - there was no connection at all.  This is a note for the MTS - hundreds of Russian tourists fly daily in transit through Korea, who have chosen South-East Asia and Oceania for recreation.  It would be nice to fix this thing. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/166593/">https://habr.com/ru/post/166593/</a></p>
