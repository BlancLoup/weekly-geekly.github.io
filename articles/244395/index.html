  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Samsung EYECAN + - mouse for people with disabilities</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Good afternoon, Habr! <br><br>  In addition to mobile devices, TV / audio / video and home appliances, photo and video cameras, computer peripherals and data storage devices, Samsung Electronics has been developing medical equipment for many years.  Two years ago, the company announced a device for people with disabilities EYECAN - a mouse that was controlled by eye movement using special glasses.  The other day, Samsung introduced the second generation of this development called EYECAN +, which will allow completely immobilized people to browse the web, as well as create and edit documents with a simple pupil movement. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/048/24e/328/04824e328cd2726c483dec6a206079b4.jpg" alt="image"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  EYECAN + is one of the first devices of its kind, since it does not require any additional wearable devices, such as glasses or helmets.  This is a portable device that works wirelessly.  Its unit, equipped with a set of cameras, is located under the monitor and monitors the movement of human eyes, giving the computer commands and moving the cursor to the right place. 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>
        <script>
          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      For EYECAN + to work correctly, the user must be located at a distance of 60-70 cm from the monitor.  The position does not matter, so a person can either sit or lie in front of the screen.  Calibration of the device will only be required during the first power up, since EYECAN + remembers the characteristics of each user's eyes.  It is also possible to adjust the sensitivity of the device - both during calibration and during operation.  After calibration, the user interface of EYECAN + is displayed as a pop-up menu in one of two modes: a menu in a standard rectangular window or a menu with a floating wheel;  Both display options contain 18 different commands. <br><br>  The operation of all 18 teams is carried out through the movement of the pupils and blinking.  For example, one of the commands can be selected by a direct glance at its icon in the general menu and by flashing, which replaces a click on the button of an ordinary computer mouse.  Commands include copying, pasting, selecting objects or text fragments, as well as dragging, scrolling, and zooming.  Additional user commands that replace hotkeys, such as closing a program (Alt + F4) or typing (Ctrl + P), can be created separately. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/7ef/f17/4e5/7eff174e5ca53e2f738f44e3549c10e7.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Compared with the first version of EYECAN, which was introduced in March 2012, the calibration capabilities and functionality of the EYECAN + have been significantly improved.  For this, in many ways, one should thank Hyun Jin Shin, a graduate student in computer science at Yonsei University in Seoul.  Sheen's body is paralyzed from birth.  Working on the EYECAN project in 2011-2012, he assumed a key role in the development of the second generation device.  For 17 months, Shin collaborated with Samsung engineers, painstakingly adjusting the functions, commands and response levels of EYECAN +, while trying to keep it simple and easy to use. <br><br>  Samsung does not plan to commercialize EYECAN +: the company will produce a limited number of these devices annually and donate them to people in need through charitable organizations.  Both the technology and the design part of EYECAN + will soon acquire open source code, which will make the device as accessible as possible to third-party companies and organizations. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/244395/">https://habr.com/ru/post/244395/</a></p>
