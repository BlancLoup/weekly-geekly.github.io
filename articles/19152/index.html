  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Oh, those school years ...</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  I have one feature.  I am prone to reflection.  So, quite often I analyze my behaviors and stereotypes and try to figure out what influenced me when making this or that decision.  Most often, such reflections arise in me when I encounter any problems (in particular, related to work or self-organization). <br><br>  Quite often in these very reflections I return to my school years.  It seems to me that it is during this period that stereotypes and behavioral patterns are formed, which in the future affect our activities.  Moreover, many of them are unfavorable.  For myself, I was able to identify the following problems that prevent us from being more effective: <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  <b>1. Lack of teamwork</b> <br>  The school does not instill teamwork skills.  He acted as the organizer of the collective mind - get bad (and what about Brain stunning?).  Thus, it seems to me, the school brings up singles.  In real life and in work, communication is extremely important.  Under the condition of the division of labor, it is impossible to do without outside consultations.  Especially in IT.  Even in a different way, it is difficult to imagine the effective work of an IT company that does not use other people's experience and experience.

      <b>2. Specialization</b> <br>  In principle, this item is related to the previous one.  Specialization in the school is almost absent.  As far as I remember, the attitude towards the student, who has fours in all subjects, was significantly better than the student who had 3‚Äì4 subjects and 3-2 for the rest.  One size fits all, and it does not matter that this can be ruined talent. <br><br>  Yes, a moot point.  There are schools and classes with specialization, but not everyone is lucky enough to get into them.  The second question is the need for all-round development.  What happens if you neglect them - you can contemplate on <a href="http://youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DLaTMXt4EV54">YouTube</a> for a long time (but this, it seems to me, is already extreme). <br><br>  <b>3. Time limit</b> <br>  All have their own characteristics.  Different people work effectively at different times - there are owls, there are larks.  For school, this line is erased.  Do you study?  Be kind, come over at 8 o'clock - go to 15. Result?  Performance problems. <br><br>  I know plenty of people who can work effectively only in the afternoon (or better at night).  They left their permanent jobs for freelancing and, in general, are satisfied with life and feel more than comfortable.  What would say at school?  That's right - lazy and dormouse. <br><br>  <b>4. Pressure of authority</b> <br>  As I recall, imposing the opinion of the teacher is an absolutely normal practice in school.  Obviously, she discourages any desire to think and develop their point of view.  How many times have I met with people who are afraid to express their views to the authorities.  Even in the case when they know the problem and the methods of its solution.  The boss knows better ... Or another situation when there is a problem, but the solution is not obvious to her.  In such cases, many will prefer to remain silent, fearing to receive in response - ‚ÄúFound a problem - so solve it.‚Äù <br><br>  <b>5. You can not be wrong</b> <br>  At school, this case is pretty simple.  Wrong - get a discount on the assessment.  When I first started working, I was afraid to make a mistake in panic.  Now I notice that many conflicts could have been avoided if people had not had this fear.  Had problems identification skills.  And there would be no such common reflex to ‚Äúrake garbage under the carpet‚Äù.  They did not notice, well, okay ... The one who does nothing is not mistaken.  When I make a mistake - post factum, trying to understand its causes.  I am pleased with her, as I gained additional experience. <br><br>  <b>6. Work on the bugs</b> <br>  In my opinion, one of the most useful methods is a pity that so little attention is paid to it.  Although they say that the smart learns from the mistakes of others, but there is one subtlety.  For me, there is a clear distinction between the concepts of ‚Äúknow‚Äù and ‚Äúrealize‚Äù.  To know is to have information about something, and to realize is when information is embedded in the picture of the world.  Awareness can only come from one‚Äôs own experience.  That is, you can know about the mistakes of others, but until you can‚Äôt feel their consequences on yourself - they don‚Äôt carry much practical value. <br><br>  Doubt?  Here is an example: to the question of whether you want to be healthy or sick, I am sure that everyone will answer - "Of course, I want to be healthy."  What is needed for this is everyone knows: get enough sleep, keep an active lifestyle, try to avoid stress, do not smoke, do not abuse coffee / alcohol, and so on.  But when you start to avoid stress, usually after breakdowns or heart attacks, coffee consumption decreases after the onset of heart problems, and sports are seriously considered only after the onset of health problems ... Here it is - the difference between knowledge and awareness.  Thunder does not break out - a peasant does not cross. <br><br>  <b>7. Help me decide</b> <br>  Here it is - the primary goal for the school.  Do not release a herd of clones with a given set of knowledge.  And to help people, in one of the most difficult periods of their lives, to decide.  Adapt.  Find your place.  For example, I (as I now understand it) lacked an introduction to psychology.  Basics of communication.  Rhetoric, maybe.  But instead of helping, we get pressure and attempt to drive in the frame. <br><br>  These are the problems that seem to me the most significant in school education.  Yes, perhaps all this is subjective.  But nevertheless ... Plus, besides the help in self-determination, it seems to me that the school should provide skills for obtaining knowledge.  Not cramming (which works well for a short-term result, both at school and at a university), namely, to gain knowledge. <br><br>  Original <a href="http://deadline-as-lifestyle.blogspot.com/2008/01/blog-post_22.html">here</a> <br></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/19152/">https://habr.com/ru/post/19152/</a></p>
