      <br>
      Let me remind you, the essence of the problem: <br>  - the service center refused to apply the warranty, although in other SCs this particular case was a guarantee; <br>  - issued an invoice for the repair of the motherboard worth twice the price of the laptop itself; <br>  - I have to pay 100 francs, even if I want to get back a broken laptop. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  When I wrote the first post, I was waiting for a response from Toshiba herself, leaving no hope that I got this dishonest SC, although it is the only one in Switzerland. <br><br>  But besides this, I wrote several more letters to organizations responsible for protecting the rights of buyers, like our Society about consumer protection.  Having received an official response from them, <b>‚Äúthe requirement to pay any amount for the diagnosis is illegal if they have not notified me in advance‚Äù</b> .  At least this is the case in Switzerland, but I think in other European countries as well. <br><br>  In the <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/140508/">comments to the previous topic,</a> <a href="http://geektimes.ru/users/mgrin/" class="user_link">Mgrin</a> wrote about similar practices.  So, at least this requirement is illegal and they violate local laws. <br>  Moreover, the representative from the federal authority replied kindly and said that, in order to put pressure on them, I could unsubscribe to them that my case was known and my case was being monitored. <br><br>  He sighed a little more freely, with the support of the federal authorities.  I haven‚Äôt written letters to the SC yet, as I haven‚Äôt received a response from Toshiba herself. <br>  And to be honest, I have not received a response so far.  But yesterday came the laptop, repaired. <br><br>  In the documents to the laptop, of course, it is somehow strange at the beginning that it was because there was an incorrect update of the BIOS - the case is not a guarantee.  But then the word ‚ÄúWarranty‚Äù stands in front of each item of the work performed and the replaced motherboard.  Moreover, they even paid for the delivery. <br><br>  Regarding communication with Toshiba, it is very difficult to actually find where to unsubscribe.  They have everything divided by country, and if you are from another country, they cannot help you.  At the very beginning I called tosiba in the States - because by the time they were the only ones working at that time, a support specialist asked me about the serial number, name, phone number for a long time, and finally asked what country I was from.  In response to Switzerland, he said that he could not help anything, I need to contact my local SC. <br><br>  I wrote about the problem on the Toshiba forum - and literally the next day the moderator answered me that they had forwarded the description of my situation to the Toshiba customer support department.  Wait.  I think, in the end, the problem was solved through them.  Because in correspondence with the SC, I asked to give contact to the representative of Toshiba, who oversees their SC, because I wanted to escalate the problem, they gave the address ... @ toshiba.ch, but looking, I saw that the address is physically the same as that of SC.  I don‚Äôt know if they gave their address with toshiba.ch at the end or is it really Toshibov‚Äôs.  They just do not understand their relationship there.  Although there also wrote. <br><br>  As a conclusion, in my situation, apparently, I ran into a Service Center, who wanted to cut down some money.  But I am sure that the situation was resolved by Toshiba.  Although the e-mail from them never received.  But it is better to get a repaired laptop than a letter that they cannot help. <br><br>  I hope my story was useful to someone. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/141301/">https://habr.com/ru/post/141301/</a></p>
