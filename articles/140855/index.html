      ‚Äú <i>The results of the study did not come as a surprise to us.</i>  <i>The popularity of a country among cyber fraudsters depends on the cost of the hosting itself, the digital infrastructure provided by the websites, and Internet legislation.</i>  <i>Scammers will never risk profits and their own freedom for the sake of placing the site in an exotic and unusual domain zone.</i>  <i>They also soberly estimate the possible costs and volume of ‚Äúrevenue‚Äù as any enterprise</i> , ‚Äùsays Ralph Benzm√ºller (G Data Software). <br><br>  Dr.Web analyst Vyacheslav Medvedev believes that if you take into account only factors related to the placement of sites, then for the ‚Äúattack‚Äù you need to choose a rather ‚Äúthick‚Äù channel on the Internet, as well as a resource where the registration procedure will be the easiest.  Almost all developed countries of Europe and America meet this requirement.  ‚Äú <i>In general, modern criminal groups operating on the Internet are distributed.</i>  <i>The organizers are in one country, the malware developers are in the second, the hackers of the sites are in the third, and so on.</i>  <i>Moreover, everything is more complicated with hosting.</i>  <i>For example, domain registration can be made in Russia by request from the USA, and servers can be placed in China.</i>  <i>Therefore, it is often impossible to stop criminal activity by the forces of one country</i> ‚Äù. <br><br>  <b>Lists of "distinguished"</b> <br><br>  The first places, in terms of attractiveness for the allocation of malicious resources, are the United States, France and Puerto Rico.  Then Ukraine, Germany, and in the sixth place in honor of Russia.  These statistics coincide with the research of "Kaspersky Lab" for February 2012 "rating of the states on which resources are placed malicious programs."  But here Russia has already entered the top three, losing to Holland and the United States. <br><br>  A significant factor is also the legislation on the Internet, which is different in different countries.  If some states consider certain actions to be illegal, then the laws of others fully allow such behavior on the global web.  ‚ÄúThe <i>example of China shows that the most effective measures are those taken at the level of regulators, and the measures are quite tough.</i>  <i>Two years ago, by the number of malicious hosting sites, this country was in the lead, by a wide margin from other countries.</i>  <i>This country accounted for more than half of all malware sources on the Internet (52%).</i>  <i>After tightening the legislation in 2010, this figure fell to 13%.</i>  <i>And now, according to our data, China accounts for only 1.45%</i> , ‚Äùnotes senior antivirus expert at Kaspersky Lab, Yuri Namestnikov. <br><br>  <b>Global paranoia</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/251/fdf/886/251fdf886de56bbf028b69686ffe27d0.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  In Russia, at the level of legislation regarding the Internet, the latest news was that the FSB will develop measures to clean up the Internet from Western intelligence services.  The government is hitting the next global paranoia.  It is no secret that wars are now largely won in the blogosphere, where everyone can express their opinion: who is right and who is the victim, and give their arguments, facts, videos from the scene and personal stories of eyewitnesses. <br><br>  " <i>As part of cyber security, we need to protect our society from the activities of Western intelligence services or intelligence services that would like to cause us some damage. We know that Western intelligence services create special units that are aimed at studying this problem, to create a corresponding base in countries where they want to carry out this activity</i> "- said the first deputy director of the FSB of Russia, Army General Sergey Smirnov.  " <i>For society, these measures will not have any consequences from the point of view of democratic norms and anything else. But society must protect itself, we cannot otherwise: if the adversary uses essentially dirty technologies, then we need to clean it up somehow space from such an activity</i> . " <br><br>  <b>Public Enemies</b> <br><br>  However, we are not at war now.  Rather, cold standoff.  So the most discussed news was the statement of Republican Mitt Romney, who called Russia "the main opponent of America."  Such attacks in the direction of Russia can not but cause concern. <br><br>  Hackers will continue to look for "gaps" in security systems.  And if large organizations like Anonymous express their motives as an independent initiative, then shadow cyber warfare, the purpose of attacks of which is most often valuable information, may well trade their skills in any territory.  Statistics show that this movement is not one-sided to Russia.  And the sooner decisions to improve security measures are taken, the better, of course.  Still, this should not lead to the next branch of the ‚Äúiron curtain‚Äù between the countries leading the list of attractiveness for hackers. <br><br>  <i>MyAsterisk collected and translated the information for you <a href="http://www.myasterisk.ru/">.</a></i> <br><br>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/myasterisk/blog/140803/">Start</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/140855/">https://habr.com/ru/post/140855/</a></p>
