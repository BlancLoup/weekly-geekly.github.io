Pure user experience</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/835/263/f47/835263f478891c6f367b6db739b018bb.png" align="left">  Today, checking mail on gmail-e, Google has kindly notified me that some stories have been created for me.  Not really knowing what it was about, what it was about or where it came from, I nevertheless clicked and decided to see what the good corporation had once again invented.  Slowly began to understand what was happening.  The idea kind of even started to like.  I decided to conduct an unbiased testing, without specifically reading any reference information or digging into the search engines.  I decided to share the review with Habr, I did not find the benefit of a similar article.  There is a bit of traffic under the cut (10 megabytes before uploading to habrastorage).  C Google is not affiliated, with a construction site, yes, otherwise from where I have pictures;) And for the impatient, just a <a href="https://plus.google.com/101723438788857238743/stories/9507042f-cb9a-3b97-bcc1-1b5a4dfaeea0/1%3Fauthkey">link to an example</a> . <br><br>  <b>UPD:</b> in the comments kindly noticed that the stories have existed since May (announced in the blog).  I do not know, did not notice.  Apparently the automatic creation of stories is an attempt to pull them out.  More closely looked for articles on the site, did not find anything about them.  Therefore, leave the article, do not get the same dust in the drafts to her. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  The essence of "stories" </h4><br>  Stories is a beautiful presentation of your photos uploaded to Google Photos.  Presentation with captions, a beautiful transition to each of the following photos.  Formed on the basis of albums.  And Google to show me rolled out not all the photos from the album, but only some.  What criteria I would like to know, but I did not try to analyze and left them selected. <br><br><h4>  How it looks and what I think about it </h4><br>  Having already managed to work with stories, I decided to look for where they added this part.  It turned out that if you go to your photos, a new item appeared in the drop-down menu.  Intuitively, where to look for a new service.  ok.

Pretty nice work. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/2b6/448/ea4/2b6448ea4d0eda635e461b6cc7dcb5c3.png"><br><br>  The cover of the story itself is also pretty pretty.  The picture is moving.  All the latest web mod.  The cover can be changed.  Headline too.  And right there.  Interface verdict is ok. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/96b/93b/2db/96b93b2dbc59bc9dc8d31753965b1061.png"><br><br><br><br>  When you open the newly created history for the first time, the ‚Äúshare‚Äù button is available.  Then it disappears and you can probably configure it through the ‚Äúaccess settings‚Äù available in the menu. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/4cb/459/015/4cb459015c75f7cb6895826e4eec6c0e.png"><br><br>  In the "share" button, everything is the same as the traditional interface for photos, Google documents.  I remember that at the very beginning I didn‚Äôt really understand how to share everything correctly.  Now it seems quite comfortable and understandable to yourself. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/0d1/f13/a7a/0d1f13a7ae454d848b0e996503302aea.png"><br><br>  The "change" button allows you to select photos for the story from the album.  The interface is similar to uploading photos.  Convenient and understandable. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e12/df8/bd5/e12df8bd565a8e0a5d1c4b4c00c67893.png"><br><br>  As I mentioned earlier, the ‚Äúshare‚Äù button disappears and you can adjust access through the access settings available right there in the menu. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/0ec/83f/b3f/0ec83fb3ff92f76bdfca091d77c1e646.png"><br><br>  By the way, these access settings do not work.  It looks like a bug. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/867/4ae/a19/8674aea1998b84fe88354d60eeada597.png"><br><br>  Good thing you can immediately report this in support.  This item is "review".  The service seems to be still being tested.  That's right, that they got the opportunity to immediately unsubscribe their opinions.  What I did. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/63a/901/a8b/63a901a8b511eed37c4a6fe0369defe6.png"><br><br>  Function remake some kind of strange.  It is not clear how it differs from delete.  Because it also requests the removal of history.  Minus.  In general, there are ‚Äúchange‚Äù and ‚Äúremake‚Äù functions.  Is it synonymous to me?  especially in context.  Not obvious. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/608/649/524/60864952473b1f3379f206c2b5e37350.png"><br><br>  When viewing the story, I, as the owner, can add a signature on the go.  Conveniently, I agree.  But this addition is not available for all photos.  Photos that are vertically included entirely, the fields for editing do not have. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/dc1/0f9/74c/dc10f974c688399a561a53c1c8766578.png"><br><br>  To add a caption to these photos (which, when viewing the history do not have a field right away), go to the information editing page and add a caption there.  BUT.  Go back to your story in any way.  I did not find.  It infuriates wildly.  Frank flaw. <br><br><h4>  We summarize </h4><br>  All photos.  Now a little generalization.  In principle, I liked this innovation for displaying photos.  You can create a cool and beautiful presentation and show your friends / colleagues.  Submission of photos is so much more spectacular.  Especially if you look in full screen mode.  However, this is only relevant for users who are not lazy to add descriptions (signature in Google terminology).  Without them, the effect will be less.  On the interfaces in general, the rules.  Yesterday I had to face the administration of the Google Group for the first time, and so there is a complete mess.  Here, in general, everything is more or less clear.  There are still unexplored moments, but you can already creative.  I doubt that the service will be widely distributed, but IMHO it is even more interesting than the whole unnecessary attempt to sit down on the social network market in the form of google +. <br><br>  Here is a link to the <a href="https://plus.google.com/101723438788857238743/stories/9507042f-cb9a-3b97-bcc1-1b5a4dfaeea0/1%3Fauthkey">story</a> that was in the screenshots.  And a survey for statistics. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/228355/">https://habr.com/ru/post/228355/</a></p>
