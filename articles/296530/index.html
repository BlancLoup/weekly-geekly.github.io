  <section class="page js-page"><h1>MasterPass is gaining momentum</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  In December 2014, the <a href="http://payonline.ru/%3Futm_source%3Dmegamozg%26utm_medium%3Dreferral%26utm_campaign%3Dwebpayments-main">PayOnline</a> electronic payment <a href="http://payonline.ru/%3Futm_source%3Dmegamozg%26utm_medium%3Dreferral%26utm_campaign%3Dwebpayments-main">system was</a> one of the first in Russia to introduce <a href="http://payonline.ru/masterpass/">the MasterPass payment solution</a> , a MasterCard product.  Over the past year and a half since its release, MasterPass has been actively conquering Europe, and recently, in its <a href="http://newsroom.mastercard.com/press-releases/40-increase-month-over-month-of-masterpass-transactions-in-europe/">press release,</a> MasterCard shared the first results. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f58/ae3/4c0/f58ae34c07ea4e0682a5bf363ed13350.png" alt="image"><br><a name="habracut"></a>  The world is becoming digital, and more and more people have the opportunity to streamline the shopping process with MasterPass.  To date, this payment instrument is accepted in 24 countries of the world and is most often used in Germany, Belgium, Hungary and Turkey.  Since the launch, which took place in February 2013, over a quarter of a million retailers around the world have already integrated payment acceptance, and the number of MasterPass transactions in Europe has grown by an average of 40% every month over the past six months. <br><br>  MasterPass is a system that helps users skip steps to complete payment and contact information when paying.  Wallets connected to MasterPass (this can be your Internet bank or e-wallet) store information on all your cards and delivery addresses, and you do not need to re-enter these data on the websites when making payments.

The less data mobile users have to enter, the higher the chance that they will turn into customers and real sales.  Thanks to MasterPass, it is not necessary to enter the card details, shipping addresses and telephone numbers every time, ‚Äùsays Andrea Underheggen, founder and CEO of Shopgate.  "The higher the conversion rate, the greater the customer satisfaction and the chance that he will return for a second purchase." <br><br>  In the UK, MasterPass was actively used as a tool to pay bills in restaurants and cafes.  The Japanese food network wagamama allowed customers to pay for orders through the MasterPass mobile app.  Such cooperation has become mutually beneficial for consumers and restaurants: the client can enjoy the ordered dish and pay for it through a mobile device, without waiting for the help of the waiters, which will save time and allow you to quickly free up a table for new customers.  The popularity of this option tells us that in the near future wagamama customers will be able to familiarize themselves with the menu using the application and order additional dishes and drinks immediately to their table.  Following the success of the Japanese restaurant, an agreement with MasterCard was made by other British food chains in order to provide customers with a convenient and fast mobile solution.  Also in the United Kingdom, the procedure for buying tickets to concerts, festivals, to the theater with the help of <a href="http://www.eventim.co.uk/">Eventim</a> services and the like has been <a href="http://www.eventim.co.uk/">simplified</a> by connecting to MasterPass. <br><br>  The number and variety of retailers joining MasterPass in Italy is growing at an even faster pace, reaching about 5,000 online stores (40% of all Italian trading and service enterprises) since its launch in 2013.  Among them are participants of the top 10 retailers in Italy.  <a href="http://www.alitalia.com/us_en/">Alitalia</a> , the national Italian airline, and the main railway operator <a href="http://www.trenitalia.com/tcom-en">Trenitalia</a> offer travelers the option of paying for tickets via MasterPass, as does the national railway operator of the Czech Republic.  Nicola Arnes, Vice President of eBusiness Alitalia, comments: <br><br>  Since the launch of MasterPass in June 2015 in Turkey, the payment service has become an electronic wallet that simplifies any purchase - from a cup of coffee to a taxi ride.  The partnership with <a href="http://www.caffenero.com.tr/">Caff√® Nero</a> , <a href="https://www.bitaksi.com/">Bi Taksi</a> (Get Taxi) and <a href="http://getir.com/">Getir</a> has changed the way users experience online and in-app shopping. <br><br>  <i>If you want to join the world trends and connect the latest MasterPass convenient payment technology on your website, <a href="http://masterpass.payonline.ru/%3Futm_source%3Dmegamozg%26utm_medium%3Dreferral%26utm_campaign%3Dwebpayments-main">you can</a> leave a request <a href="http://masterpass.payonline.ru/%3Futm_source%3Dmegamozg%26utm_medium%3Dreferral%26utm_campaign%3Dwebpayments-main">here</a> .</i> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/296530/">https://habr.com/ru/post/296530/</a></p>
