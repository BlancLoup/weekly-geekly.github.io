On the Internet, it all looks different, so you need to sell differently. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  At <a href="http://www.carrotquest.io/%3Futm_source%3Dmegam%26utm_medium%3Dcontent%26utm_content%3Dsale%26utm_campaign%3Dchat">Carrot Quest,</a> we are constantly exploring the market for online sales, new chips and hacks, because  Our service is focused on this.  We increase the first and repeated sales due to knowledge of each visitor and the subsequent marketing on the basis of this knowledge.  Here we will tell you in detail about what an online chat should be in order for it to provide most of your sales. <br><br>  Most online chats do not allow operators to understand who is "on the other side of the screen."  It does not show the entire history of user actions, what segments it is in and what it is doing at the moment.  Therefore, all that remains for them is to wait for questions from visitors and respond in a pattern.  Do you think it is possible to sell without knowing who is in front of you and what interests does he pursue?  It is possible, only the effectiveness of such actions will be very low ‚Äî a conversion of 1-2%.

      But the online chat in conjunction with the collection of data about users can be a great tool for sales on the Internet.  According to the results of a large <a href="http://www.emarketer.com/Article/How-Helpful-Live-Chat/1007235">study,</a> it turned out that many companies provide chat with an average of 38% of sales.  You can give your operators a full-fledged tool and significantly increase the conversion to the purchase using the chat. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/da0/c5f/246/da0c5f246943422075e81530af2f7b30.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The most important thing is that the online chat service is a real communication tool, and not just an instant messenger for answering visitors' questions. <br><br>  The whole process of communication on the Internet is built around one key point: knowledge of the actions of each user and the history of communication with him.  If you know about each user action (from where he came, what button he pressed, which pages he looked at, how many times he came, asked what, etc.), then communication with him from thoughtless turns into a full-fledged personal contact, with which you can bring it to the purchase. <br><br>  In <a href="http://www.carrotquest.io/%3Futm_source%3Dmegam%26utm_medium%3Dcontent%26utm_content%3Dsale%26utm_campaign%3Dchat">Carrot Quest,</a> we track the actions of each site visitor.  This is what the user information card looks like. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/b50/09d/b74/b5009db747a753657b43284cdcdb082d.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The card displays all user information: <br><br><ul><li>  his actions on the site (what pages he visited, what services he ordered, what products he looked through, etc.); </li><li>  which segment it belongs to; </li><li>  what channel did it come from (in the example it is ‚Äúfirst referral‚Äù) </li><li>  accounts in social networks; </li><li>  correspondence history with him; </li><li>  and etc. </li></ul><br><br>  In fact, it is like a whole dossier per visitor.  He can only come in, but you will already know some information about him. <br><br>  So that employees use this information quickly and can process several dialogues at once, the service has created an optimal interface. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/c08/8d4/aad/c088d4aad3a03ce5ed5651de434e120b.png" alt="image"><br><br>  The whole interface is divided into 3 parts: <br><ul><li>  list of all conversations; </li><li>  current dialogue with the user; </li><li>  User information. </li></ul><br><br><h4>  <b>1. List of dialogs</b> </h4><br><br>  All new or closed dialogs are displayed in the list of all dialogs.  Here you can: <br><ul><li>  view open / closed dialogues; </li><li>  filter conversations by operators; </li><li>  filter dialogs by tags; </li><li>  on the avatar to see who last wrote in this dialogue; </li><li>  see the last message in the dialogue; </li><li>  see which tags were previously put to this dialog. </li></ul><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/74a/184/828/74a184828565fc0d12dfdbb87ea442b7.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  With these capabilities, operators quickly navigate the list of dialogs. <br><br><br><h4>  <b>2. The current dialogue with the user</b> </h4><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/774/93a/3ec/77493a3ec63ddb27a6782764976dc2d2.png" alt="image"><br><br>  It has everything to make it convenient for one or several operators to communicate with the user. <br><ul><li>  message feed; </li><li>  adding tags to the dialog; </li><li>  message field; </li></ul><br>  The message feed can be switched to the history of the dialogs, all the dialogs with this user will be visible there.  You can close the dialog (complete it).  This is important for keeping the list of incoming dialogs and statistics clean. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/9b1/9eb/c22/9b19ebc227d13b5759ce276709e94d5b.png" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>Icons, describing from left to right:</b> <br><ul><li>  Notes.  With the help of notes, operators can communicate with each other as part of a dialogue, and the user will not see their correspondence.  In the message feed, the note looks like this: <br></li></ul><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/f6b/2e1/656/f6b2e1656b1af848c0b81275c6132813.png" alt="image"><br><br><ul><li>  Response templates are pre-stored responses that operators can use to save time and respond faster.  You can add answer templates right here. To do this, enter text in the answer field and click ‚ÄúSave Answer‚Äù.  Your answer will be added to the list of templates. </li></ul><br><ul><li>  Sending files (you can attach any file no larger than 2 megabytes in size and the user downloads it by reference); </li></ul><br><br><h4>  <b>3. User information</b> </h4><br><br>  This is a mini user card, with which the operator conducts the current dialogue. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/09c/066/e8e/09c066e8e21db1775d616494f160089c.png" alt="image"><br><br>  User data (name, email, telephone), the operator can adjust itself.  The segments that are displayed here are those segments that you pre-configure and start tracking.  The service immediately shows you which segment the user belongs to. <br><br>  If the user left an email, then data from public sources is collected in his card: name, avatar, links to social networks. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/029/f5b/e04/029f5be04fcfa5f00ef4849d4f87bf9f.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  To view a detailed user card, you just need to click on the user name in the ‚ÄúUser Information‚Äù section. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/15c/b4c/d3c/15cb4cd3cd366066ce0edee11eecdc8a.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h4>  <b>The main thing is not to lose touch</b> </h4><br><br>  It is necessary for a visitor to enter your email in any field, as the service will immediately write it on the card.  All correspondence with the user will be duplicated by his mail.  And he can reply to messages in the chat directly from the mail, no need to return to the site. <br><br>  The user receives a message that he does not need to sit and wait for a response on the site. <br><br>  As a result, you do not lose contact with your users. <br><br>  With pleasure, the <a href="http://www.carrotquest.io/%3Futm_source%3Dmegam%26utm_medium%3Dcontent%26utm_content%3Dsale%26utm_campaign%3Dchat">Carrot Quest</a> team </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/294758/">https://habr.com/ru/post/294758/</a></p>
