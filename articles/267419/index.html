  <section class="page js-page"><h1>All-Russian competition "Open Data"</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Hi, Habr! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/8e3/86f/e97/8e386fe970204ea6a56730a26c6009ed.png"><br><br>  Last time, we already helped <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/mlclass/blog/260675/">Hackaton with open data</a> , which was later invented and implemented <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/261329/">several interesting services</a> .  Now we are in a hurry to announce that a very large-scale All-Russian data analysis event is starting.  We will try to help the Analytical Center under the Government of the Russian Federation and the Open Government to make this event really interesting and exciting.  Last time we almost succeeded.  It is clear that the level of such events for data analysts is far from <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/mlclass/">what we write and what we do</a> .  However, we assume that it is better to try to improve this situation once more than to do nothing. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h3>  Formal entry </h3><br>  So, everything is in order.  Within the framework of the competition, numerous events will take place, the action of which will unfold both at the capital and at the regional innovation platforms that supported the Open Government initiative.

      <br>
      The distinction of the competition will be the wide participation in the competition of representatives of state bodies and organizations, representatives of state development institutions, venture capital investors and large innovative companies, data experts and socially-oriented non-profit organizations.  Participants in the competition will be able to take advantage of consulting support from experts and organizations that supported the competition. <br><br><h3>  Hackathon Data.gov.ru - HACKATHON # 2 </h3><br>  The most important thing is that on October 10-11 in Moscow, on the platform of the Analytical Center under the Government of the Russian Federation, a hackathon will be held according to open data, in which you can take part regardless of participation in the competition.  Come! <br><br>  Of course, many people believe that such events are not beneficial or interesting.  However, there must be some experience in everything.  And the more often such events are held, the better they will become over time. <br><br><h3>  All-Russian competition.  What, where and when? </h3><br>  The competition is quite long due to the fact that it is also held in the regions, which is very pleasing. <br><br>  <b>The beginning of the competition</b> .  Until 09.10.2015 will be the collection of applications, the formation of teams.  There is not much time left, so we recommend filling out an application <a href="http://opendatacontest.ru/form/">here.</a> <br><br>  <b>Qualifying round</b> .  After that, October 10, 2015 - October 10, 2015, the hackathons themselves will pass in the regions of the Russian Federation, where it is proposed to develop a prototype, then show it to the experts for evaluation and proceed to the next stage <br><br>  <b>Correspondence tour</b> .  After that, it will be possible for a month and a half, namely, from 10/12/2015 to 11/30/2015, to refine the functionality of your product, receive feedback from experts and prepare for the next stage <br><br>  <b>Technical expertise</b> .  Next, there is an assessment of projects with technical expertise on the results of which teams receive admission to the final.  It will be held 02/01/2015. <br><br>  <b>Final</b>  At the end, as usual there will be a final tour.  There will be a presentation of the revised projects and an assessment of their jury.  The award itself will be held 11/12/2015 <br><br><h3>  Nominations </h3><br>  <b>BEST SOCIAL APP OR SERVICE</b> .  It belongs to the category of nominations of the non-profit sector.  Projects nominated for the award of the prize for the best social application (service) should be aimed at solving urgent social problems, including those related to socially vulnerable groups of the population.

It belongs to the category of nominations of the technology sector.  Projects nominated for the award for the best technical solution should be based on original technical solutions and promising technologies, and should also be flawless in terms of software and hardware implementation. <br>  A feature of projects nominated for the award for the best technical solution is the ability to create middleware applications that work for a B2B audience, providing an effective solution to individual tasks related to the creation of websites, portals and applications using open data. <br>  Significant criteria for evaluating such projects are also the criterion of the estimated market volume, the criterion of code portability, the convenience of integration into known content management systems and other similar criteria. <br>  Projects that claim to attract venture capital investments must have a high-quality financial and economic rationale and comply with the standards for submitting investment applications. <br><br>  <b>BEST BUSINESS APPLICATION OR SERVICE</b> .  It belongs to the category of commercial sector nominations.  Projects nominated for the award for the best business application (service) should be aimed at solving problems that are relevant to market participants or consumers of commercial services.  For projects nominated for the award of the prize for the best business application (service), there are high requirements for profitability. <br>  Significant criteria for evaluating such projects are the criterion for predictive assessment of market capacity, the criterion for the quality of marketing analysis, the originality of the business model and / or service promotion strategy, as well as other similar criteria. <br>  An additional advantage of such projects is their compliance with the priorities of the state social policy. <br>  Projects that claim to attract financial investments must have a high-quality financial and economic rationale and comply with the standards for submitting applications for investment. <br><br><h3>  Hackatons in the regions </h3><br>  If you are also passionate about open data, like the Open Government and the Analytical Center under the Government of the Russian Federation, you want the hackathon to take place in your region, are ready to assemble a team of organizers and actively participate in the preparation - write to opendatacontest@ac.gov.ru! <br><br>  See you at the <a href="http://opendatacontest.ru/">hackathon</a> ! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/267419/">https://habr.com/ru/post/267419/</a></p>
