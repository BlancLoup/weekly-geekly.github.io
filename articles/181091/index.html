  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Will MySpace ever lose its monopoly?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  <i>This article was published 6 years 3 months 19 days ago, on February 8, 2007.</i>  <i>At that time, Facebook was barely <a href="http://finance.yahoo.com/news/number-active-users-facebook-over-years-214600186--finance.html">close</a> to two tens of millions of registered users, and the well-known development of events makes it possible to take a fresh look at the predictions of Mark Zuckerberg‚Äôs future work, which, <a href="http://www.pewinternet.org/Reports/2013/Teens-Social-Media-And-Privacy.aspx">according to a number of assessments, is</a> already losing popularity among some groups of users.</i> <br><br>  Aristotle distinguished friendship on the basis of common interests and the like-minded associates of a feeling of mutual proximity.  Most of the registered users of Mayspace, a phenomenally successful social networking service by Rupert Murdoch, fall into the latter category.  But the evidence of continuing expansion, which, as the Mayspeys generation is growing up, can gradually increase Murdoch's influence, causes Rupert‚Äôs control of satellite television to fade. <br><br>  At the time of the purchase, it was suggested that if Murdoch tries to spoil the Mayspace ‚Äúcontent sharing culture‚Äù by commercialization, users will simply go to one of a dozen of the clones - from Bebo.com to rising mobile star Cyworld.com, which has already conquered South Korea and is now fighting on the outskirts of "Mayspace" in the United States.  ‚ÄúBlueworld‚Äù points to research, according to which ‚ÄúMySpace‚Äù is a website of transitional age, from which kids will still grow, while ‚ÄúWhiteworld‚Äù is a full-fledged social networking site.  It turns out an interesting distinction, almost according to Aristotle, but some people think that it is only possible to shift Mayspace to competitors from niche markets.

      John Barrett (TechNewsWorld) argues that Myspace has already confidently stood on the rails of becoming what economists call the "natural monopoly."  Users have invested so much social capital in the method of publishing information about themselves that it will be unprofitable to change websites, especially taking into account the value added to Mayspace with each new user involved. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  It is well known that fax is useless if others do not have it.  This is the case in the social networking industry, except that, unlike a fax machine, it‚Äôs not possible to immediately change one site to another.  You can change your search engine to another one, even if it is Google.  But with the change of the social network service, you will not only have to arrange a move for videos, audio recordings, photos, messages, you will also lose all your friends, unless they follow you.  MySpace will not allow easy care.  Chris DeWulf believes that a large user base will help to maintain the dominance of Mayspace: ‚ÄúHaving a large size in social networks is a huge advantage.  You can find anyone on Myspeys, and the more time users spend on the site, the more they become attached to it. ‚Äù <br><br>  If Mayspace were a country, it would be the seventh in size, overtaking Russia and Bangladesh, although not all its users are active.  At the time of writing this article, he had 153 339 321 users, and by the time of the end their number was 153 523 640. What does this growth promise us?  For the first time, a generation with common interests will mature, constantly interacting - this is the embodiment of globalization.  We may not need a resume, our whole life will be online. <br><br>  But will commercialization kill the culture that spawned Miaspace?  It is reported that the 900-million three-year deal concluded with Google on advertising on Mayspace is currently being revised.  And not in the direction of the gap.  This week, when I visited the site, I was greeted with scaring blinking ads.  After entering the login and password I was greeted by a loud video ad, there were no obvious ways to disable it.  Well at least that I was not in the library. <br><br>  It does not seem to be concerned about the Mayspasers, and does not seem to be concerned about other issues.  For example, user-generated content.  "Mayspace" is its huge generator, maybe even the largest, but users are not paid.  Why not start paying?  The Google company, which owns YouTube, the largest video hosting site, is under pressure from corporations (among which, of course, there is the Fox Media Empire, which requires royalties.  And Mayspeys removes foams from ads related to user content, without which the goldmine of the social network would disappear.  The only difference is that large corporations hunt for ‚ÄúYutub‚Äù, while consumer power is distributed among 150 million users of Mayspeys.  Perhaps they should establish a network union. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/181091/">https://habr.com/ru/post/181091/</a></p>
