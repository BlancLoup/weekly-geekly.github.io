A person who gives his money wants (albeit in vain) to feel confident in the positive outcome of the case that his money will be spent not in vain. <br><br>  <a href="https://www.weblancer.net/">Freelance</a> , located at the crossroads of the Internet and money is in difficult conditions.  On the one hand, the Internet promotes anonymity, on the Internet everything is unsteady.  On the other hand, money of anonymity does not like, as well as fluctuations. <br><br>  Offline is easier - there is a specific person, some can boast of an office in a prestigious area, and in general there is a feeling of some kind of materiality and weight.  On the network with this harder.

      Maximum than can boast this site and reviews.  What is not thick, since both are easy to fake. <br><br>  In this post about reviews on our stock exchange and what we are doing to gain at least a small part of the weight that is so lacking online. <br><br>  Let's talk about how it works on our stock exchange, how different reviews on the stock exchange differ from reviews on our website, let's talk about fraud in this area, how we fight with them and some statistics at the end. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/qq/b-/6j/qqb-6jioplin-uyrfdv8xluv8r8.png"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h3>  Who needs feedback? </h3><br>  The customer is less interested in receiving feedback.  Of course, they can be used as an argument in the discussion of prepayment, but hardly more. <br><br>  Another thing is freelancers.  Without reviews, getting an order is much more difficult than with them.  It is understandable, no one wants to be the first and check how the applicant is consistent with what he says about himself.  In general, this applies not only to freelancing, in any situation where there is a buyer and the seller is relevant. <br><br><h3>  How we implemented </h3><br>  The mechanism is necessary, but implementation also matters.  In our opinion, important data in the recall are: <br><br><ul><li>  What is left a review.  We give a link to the order, where you can get acquainted with the task.  This will give an idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe complexity of the task, and in general makes it clear that the task was in principle. </li><li>  Amount within cooperation.  One thing is a feedback for a work on $ 1, another thing on $ 1000. </li><li>  Who left a review.  In this part, the difference in the authors of the review may give a different weight to the review itself.  It is much more difficult to fake reviews from people who have a rich history, who have collaborated many times, who have been in service for a long time, and so on.  By account you can understand that this is a live, active person. </li><li>  The rating that the author left a review.  The work could be done, but in the process there may be problems with deadlines or communications. </li><li>  The text of the review.  There may be important details. </li><li>  Date of publication.  Fresh reviews are more important than old ones.  And we have very very old reviews. </li></ul><br>  For convenience, we post this data in each review; it looks like this: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/sj/q4/6l/sjq46lcrntxgnvzr3bbjhbjlzig.png"><br><br>  Two reviews nearby, the difference between the authors of the reviews is clearly visible. <br><br><h3>  The difference reviews on the stock exchange </h3><br>  Here you can pay attention to the differences between the response on the stock exchange and the review on ‚Äúyour‚Äù site.  It is much easier to establish on the exchange who has left a review and how real this person is. <br><br>  He can have a story right here on the exchange, you can also contact him and ask questions about cooperation with a specific person.  It happens that not everything can be described in a review, because it is available to the recipient directly. <br><br>  It‚Äôs more difficult to understand who and what left feedback on the site controlled by the recipient.  Often there is no contact and no activity with other counterparties. <br><br><h3>  Reviews are not only good, but also bad! </h3><br>  In some cases, of course.  After all, reviews are not only positive, but also negative.  The recipient of such a review does not always agree with the validity of such a review and is perhaps never happy with such a response. <br><br>  This is another reason why on the stock exchange, uncontrolled by the recipient of the site recall, reviews have more value.  Here they are not only positive. <br><br>  It also regularly happens that one person wants to leave a review to another, but cannot do this, since he did not follow the rules. <br><br>  Here it is necessary to explain in more detail.  Feedback exchange is the final stage of cooperation. <br>  First, the customer publishes an order, executors submit applications, then the customer selects one or several performers on the site and after the completion of cooperation, the parties exchange feedback. <br><br>  The customer can choose the performer only if he left a final application, that is, confirmed that he is ready to cooperate on the specified conditions. <br><br><h3>  Avoid reviews </h3><br>  Unfortunately, the performer on the stock exchange does not always indicate.  This is partly due to the negligence or negligence of the customer, despite the fact that the subsequent publication of the recall is, in fact, the only lever through which the customer can seriously influence the performer. <br><br>  This is partly due to the fact that the performers know about this lever and avoid it consciously.  Nobody wants to be influenced.  Some customers abuse this lever, threatening to ruin their reputation, demanding extra work or something. <br>  Also, some performers avoid choosing by the performer in order to save on our already modest commission. <br><br>  Another case is when there was no order on the stock exchange at all, or problems arose when cooperating on some other order that was after a meeting on the stock exchange or even outside it. <br><br>  It‚Äôs just that we don‚Äôt allow anyone to publish reviews from anyone - it promises a lot of problems from those who want to spoil someone‚Äôs reputation and cause chaos. <br><br><h3>  Falsification of reviews </h3><br>  From the reviews not only evade, but also try to cheat them.  Sometimes even at the same time dodge and wind (WHAT?). <br><br>  The goal is simple - to increase your weight, increase your position in the ranking.  Not everyone is ready for a fair fight.  Here you can see that at the initial stage it is difficult.  Not everyone is ready to overcome these difficulties and the search for easy ways is not uncommon. <br><br>  Also, fraudsters are trying to cheat reviews, so that customers are more willing to agree to give them an advance payment. <br><br>  We deal with these phenomena in several ways: <br><br><ul><li>  Commission service.  It is not even the best, and because of its small size it is not very serious, but protection against cheating.  It‚Äôs just that it‚Äôs worth a bunch of cool reviews. </li><li>  Control multiple registrations.  Here, we are pretty much hampered by the universal desire for anonymity on the network, but we are trying to make sure that one person has one account.  This is important both to prevent feedback reviews and to avoid negative reviews. </li><li>  Any subtle mechanisms that cannot be fully disclosed, but one can say that one way or another people behave on the Internet in different ways and the analysis of these factors makes it possible to link accounts. </li></ul><br>  Simultaneous evasion and cheating in one bottle is not mutually exclusive.  A person shies away from reviews from real customers as he is not sure about the positive outcome, he is not ready to give his reputation to the customer and at the same time he writes reviews for himself.  Sometimes it happens. <br><br>  Newbies freelancers are interested in reviews, rating and position growth, in adding weight to an account. <br><br>  Old freelancers are not so interested in reviews.  There is weight, there are already a lot of reviews, and giving the customer leverage is an additional risk in case of problems. <br>  Customers are interested in the possibility to publish a review in any case. <br><br><h3>  Interesting facts </h3><br><ul><li>  The maximum number of reviews from the artist - 913, in second place 821 </li><li>  The maximum number of reviews from the customer - 773, in second place 724 </li><li>  The maximum number of negative reviews - 12 at the customer and 10 at the freelancers </li><li>  The maximum difference between the first and last review from one user over 13 years </li><li>  Negative reviews in the total mass of 2.7% </li></ul><br>  Interesting other interesting facts?  Ask, try to choose numbers. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/453078/">https://habr.com/ru/post/453078/</a></p>
