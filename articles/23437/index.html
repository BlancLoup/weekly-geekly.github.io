  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Your information culture</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  I recently looked through my old books on computer science and cybernetics to refresh some of the nuances from the history of the development of computer technology.  Well, once again I looked through a couple of paragraphs in the book ‚ÄúYour Information Culture‚Äù by Gennady Georgievich Vorobiev.  Although the book was written back in 1988, but some things from that time remain relevant to this day.  In particular, such a thing as information culture. <br><br>  As a matter of fact, I decided to reprint from this book a test for determining the level of information culture, which may be quite suitable for many today. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <strong>Your information culture</strong> 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>

I try - <br>  a) consciously regulate the flow of information coming to me (radio, TV, books, conversations), choosing only what I need, <br>  b) send more information to yourself so as not to miss anything, <br>  c) limit the amount of information using only the most important. <br><br>  19. Color in our life: <br>  a) is very important - reveals a person‚Äôs character, diagnoses diseases, treats, affects mood and productivity, helps communication and beautifies, <br>  b) probably it is, but it is said too much <br>  c) I doubt much of the above. <br><br>  20. On the text, replete with "stamps", I react - <br>  a) with violent indignation, <br>  b) negatively <br>  c) calm. <br><br>  21. Respect - <br>  a) equally theoretical theorist and practitioner, <br>  b) a theoretical scientist, <br>  c) a practitioner. <br><br>  22.

Advertising - business - <br>  a) very useful <br>  b) useful, but not always, <br>  c) at least, we have completely unnecessary. <br><br>  24. In the city - <br>  a) I will be happy to drive a guest, showing antiquity and telling interesting stories that I know, <br>  b) if I show something to the guest, it‚Äôs not old, <br>  c) I prefer not to play the role of guide for the guest. <br><br>  25. Electronic computing - <br>  a) only a product whose high effectiveness depends on a combination with other means and methods, <br>  b) a revolution that solves a lot of problems <br>  c) innovation, which should, however, be mastered slowly. <br><br>  Now that you have answered all 25 questions, evaluate your answers according to the following rules.  From the 1st to the 12th question inclusive: a = 0, b = 2, c = 4;  If two options are marked, take the arithmetic average (for example: b + c = (2 + 4) / 2 = 3).  From the 13th to the 25th question, do the opposite: a = 4, b = 2, c = 0 (with two options, also take the average).  Then add up all 25 digits, and the amount will indicate the level of your information culture as a percentage. <br><br>  For an applicant it is bad to have less than 30 percent, for a young specialist - less than 50 percent. <br><br><br>  For me personally, the last time I drove this test on myself a few years ago was 63% (left corresponding marks in the margin in pencil). </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/23437/">https://habr.com/ru/post/23437/</a></p>
