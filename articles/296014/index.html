Many advanced companies use LinkedIn as a platform for branding themselves as one of the leading employers. <br>  Using such branding techniques in LinkedIn allows the company to show its corporate culture to attract potential talents.  At the same time, a shared news feed (LinkedIn pulse) and the Influencer Influencer influence program allow Fortune 500 leaders and leaders to share stories about their success.  And their stories can often advertise the corporate culture of their company, which helped them succeed.  Take the example of the best of the best: Google‚Äôs vice president of recruitment, Laszlo Bock, is published in the LinkedIn Influencer social network about the regular development of the recruiting market, human resources, and so on.  It is there that he highlights the new and effective Google recruitment practices.

      <b>3. Twitter - Real-time communication</b> <br><br>  Twitter has long been a key platform for communicating and receiving information in real time, which is achieved thanks to its brevity and the presence of hashtags.  This is surprising, but with a few accurate tweets, you can bring your company's twitter to the popular ones; you just need to get into the trend. <br>  One of the most memorable examples of a record number of discussions in social networks is <a href="https://events.google.com/io2015/">Google IO</a> and the Academy Award in 2014. <br><br>  <b># 4. Google+ - SEO blackmail</b> <br><br>  Regardless of the absolute unpopularity of Google +, which is positioned as a social network, its deep connection to Google‚Äôs search ranking algorithm makes it simply essential to use.  Search engine optimization (SEO), which is helped by the presence on Google+, is one of the UTP (unique shopping offers) of this social network. <br>  In addition, integration with other Google applications, such as Hangout and YouTube, contributes to a wider use of accounts in this social network by users.  From now on, brands use Google+ as a live video chat with fans and followers, after which it's easy to export all of this to YouTube. <br><br>  <b># 5. Instagram - Personalizes your mobile marketing.</b> <br><br>  Instagram since 2012, after buying it on Facebook, is growing rapidly.  In December 2014, Instagram took the lead and overtook Twitter in terms of the number of active audiences per month and is now in 3rd place in the world.  Interaction between Instagram users is much more active than on any other social network.  It is understandable, no need to write texts, and visual content is created quickly and easily.  It is clear that for the most part there are fashionistas and fashionistas, as well as other audiences who love to take pictures, but its influence on the SMM market cannot be ignored. <br><br>  <b>Findings:</b> <br>  Each social platform is unique for promoting your business; however, it is recommended to use all these advantages only in combination with the advantages of active lidogenerious actions. <br>  And according to the latest marketing trends on mobile devices, using the broad capabilities of <a href="http://www.byyd.me/ru/blog/2015/04/mobile-rtb-growth/">DSP</a> tools and programmatic platforms, you can achieve up to 5 times the increase in the cost of advertising costs online. <br><br>  <b>Leaders</b> : Vkontakte, Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn <br>  <b>Underutilized:</b> Google+ <br>  <b>Niche soc.</b>  <b>Networks:</b> Instagram, Pinterest, Snapchat, Vine <br><br>  <i>Your choice of social platforms will only make sense if you have an adequate strategy and selected a clear segmentation of the needs of the consumers of your services and / or products (ie B2C, B2B or B2E).</i> <br><br>  <i>For acquaintance with part 1 use the <a href="http://megamozg.ru/company/byyd/blog/20858/">link</a> .</i> <br><br> <a href="http://www.byyd.me/ru/register/%3Futm_source%3Dmegamozg%26utm_medium%3Dpost%26utm_campaign%3Dcontent_marketing"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/041/3c5/29a/0413c529a1424210a02b160e54a40e80.png"></a> <br><br>  <a href="http://www.byyd.me/ru/%3Futm_source%3Dmegamozg">BYYD ‚Ä¢ Mobile Advertising Platform</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/296014/">https://habr.com/ru/post/296014/</a></p>
