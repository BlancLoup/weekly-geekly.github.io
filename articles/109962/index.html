  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Alt Linux may be installed in Russian schools</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  In principle, the probability is not so great, but still the implementation of such an idea is not something very unreal.  This probability also increases because on December 31 of this year the licenses for software received by schools under the First Aid program expire.  It is possible that the licenses will be prolonged in some way that is not particularly burdensome for schools, but time is running out, and schools are unlikely to want a repetition of the situation with the director of one of the regional schools, remember - Alexander M. Ponosov?  Yes, he was acquitted, a year and a half after the case was initiated, however, all this ugly case cast a shadow on both Microsoft and the Russian government itself.  So, the company "Armada" offers a very real way out - a perpetual licensing agreement with schools of the Russian Federation to install and update the <b>Alt Linux 5.0 School</b> package. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>  It is worth recalling that this package is positioned by developers as a free alternative to paid software products that require annual licensing.  The alternative is not only proprietary Microsoft software, but also Adobe, as well as other foreign IT companies.  This package, by the way, is approved by the Ministry of Education, so no difficulties, as far as can be judged, with the introduction of alternative school software should arise. <br><br>  In addition to the perpetual partnership agreement, technical support is also offered, without which it can hardly be dispensed with.  Support, according to the plan, should be carried out by phone, by e-mail, via remote access or a web-interface.  They will advise and assist both Armada and Alt Linux specialists, as well as certified partners of companies in the regions.

      The company "Armada" has already sent its proposals to the governors, so it remains to wait for their reaction.  By the way, a similar step was made by Adobe, which offered to extend licenses for installed software.  True, this is not a gratuitous offer - the extension of the software license from Adobe will be carried out, albeit with significant discounts, but on a paid basis.  In the case of non-renewal of the license, but continued operation of the software, Adobe vaguely promises not to interfere with inspections conducted by law enforcement agencies. <br><br>  Microsoft has not yet received letters and comments, but it is known that the corporation is ready to extend the licenses for its software package for only $ 8 (if for every PC in school, it still goes a little expensive for schools that never have the money). <br><br>  Well, the situation is interesting, it remains to monitor its development. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/109962/">https://habr.com/ru/post/109962/</a></p>
