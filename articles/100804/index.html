  <section class="page js-page"><h1>.about [Organizing the process of cataloging and processing photos]</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The funniest and most regrettable thing is that many image viewers decide everything for you how and where to place your photos.  And also how to sort them.  For many, in fact, it is a panacea, but not for me.  This fact has become a stumbling block for finding an easy and fast photo viewer, in the form of an analogue of FastStone Image Viewer for Windows.  For myself, I myself have decided how to catalog my collection of photos, and in such a way that it would be convenient for me in the whole process from the beginning to the end of photo processing.  Before that, I walked a long and painstaking path of all sorts of experiments. <br>  Well, now I will talk about how I organized the whole process.  For some, it may seem too time consuming, but this is only at first glance, because I tried to optimize and automate the whole process. <br>  After I moved to Mac OS X 10.6.4, it took me some time to figure out and find a replacement for some programs and set up automation of the process in this operating system.  Therefore, we will now talk about Mac OS X 10.6.4, although the whole process is almost the same as in Windows. <a name="habracut"></a><br>  So, I only shoot in RAW and use only a card reader when transferring files.  I have a daddy Photos on the disk, where all the photos are stored.  The Photos folder structure is divided into 2 camps, these are the raw and jpg folders, where the corresponding files are located. <br>  1. To import new photos from the camera, I adapted the Canon EOS Utility utility, which safely adds the files from the card to the / Photos / raw folder and then sorts the files by date, creating the directories of the 2010_07_31 type. <br>  2. Everything is fine, now open Adobe Bridge and rename the folder, adding the story component to it.  Those.  I add a description of the shooting, so that it is more or less clear what, who and when was filmed.  Now the directory view is obtained "2010_07_31 City".  Previously, instead of underscores, I used dots to separate the year, month, and day in the directory name, but I had to abandon them because of their incorrect processing in Adobe and the rsync synchronization program. <br>  3. The selection of photos that are good and sharp begins.  Viewing occurs at 100% magnification of a photo and generation of a full-size preview.  I put the photos rating.  from 1 to 5 stars.  All photos that have at least some value are marked with my rating.  Those photographs that were left without a rating are highlighted and ruthlessly removed so as not to take up space on the disk. <br>  4. I select the cards and send them all to Adobe Camera Raw, where I twist-I twist the settings, crop and other parameters. <br>  5. After all the cards have received their settings, select them all and save them in jpg format in the same directory as the raw files. <br>  6. Those photos that I liked the most, I highlight in some color in Adobe Bridge and then process each individually in Adobe Photoshop. <br>  All files are converted and processed, but when jpg images are in the same folder as the raw and xmp files, it turns out to be a mess and inconvenient to watch the results of your work, and generally enjoy the photos.  That's why I decided to divide my photo archive into 2 parts.  The first is raw material (it is raw) and the second is already processed material, which can be demonstrated as a result of its work (jpg).  The next step is to transfer all files with the jpg and jpeg extensions from the raw directory to the jpg directory while preserving the internal structure of these directories. <br>  7. Under Windows, to synchronize and transfer files between directories, I used the nnBackup utility, and under Mac OS X, I had to look for an analogue of a similar program.  Searches were short-lived and simple utility rsync saved the day. <br>  Here are two commands, the first transfers the jpg and jpeg files, removing them from the original place, the second backs up the jpg folder to another medium. <br><blockquote>  rsync -vaHx --numeric-ids --recursive --remove-source-files --progress --exclude-from = / Photos / jpg.ex / Photos / raw / / Photos / jpg / <br>  rsync -vaHx --progress --numeric-ids --delete --delete-excluded / Photos / jpg / / backup / Photos / jpg / </blockquote><br>  And in the / Photos folder is a jpg.ex file with exceptions.  Because  this program does not have the ability to simply specify the files with which we will work, then I cheated a little.  The content of the file is simple: <br><blockquote>  + * .jpg <br>  + * .jpeg <br>  - *. * </blockquote><br><br>  That's all.  We put these two commands in cron and this process will occur automatically, imperceptibly for us.  (I used to have to manually start synchronization). <br>  At the output I get: <br><blockquote>  / Photos <br>  ---&gt; / raw <br>  ------&gt; / 2010_07_11 Candle <br>  ------&gt; / 2010_07_31 City <br>  ------&gt; / etc. <br><br>  ---&gt; / jpg <br>  ------&gt; / 2010_07_11 Candle <br>  ------&gt; / 2010_07_31 City <br>  ------&gt; / etc. <br></blockquote>

      I hope that it is not very difficult to describe the whole process.  If someone has any questions, you can ask them. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/100804/">https://habr.com/ru/post/100804/</a></p>
