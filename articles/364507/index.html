New ideas in this area appear quite often.  But how to identify the potential of a startup and its relevance in the market - these are the key questions. <br><br>  You can, of course, go on a difficult path and create a product based on the future audience, which, as they say, will shoot.  But it may not shoot!  You don‚Äôt have to go far for examples: no one has seen Sergey Brynn in Google Glass for a long time, and Nike turned down a seemingly successful project with its fitness tracker Fuel-band.  The budding list can be continued for a long time ... <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b50/80c/db2/b5080cdb2a2441329b6831538f6aa548.gif">

      But still, no matter how trite it may sound, the absolute majority of successful inventions, subsequently implemented in startups, are flesh of our daily needs and habits.  It‚Äôs just that someone had the intelligence and perseverance to bring them to the finished product and systemic promotion to the market. <br><br>  We will talk about similar updates presented today at Kickstarter. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  <b>Tracker- "Netherka" Stone Tether</b> <br><br>  How often we happened to linger when leaving the house, sometimes late for important meetings, just because we could not find the keys or, for example, the wallet.  And having arrived at the presentation, it was horrified to find that the case with the laptop remained in the hallway. <br><br>  It can be seen that the guys from Del Marth LLC, who represent their supercompact tracker <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/delmarth/stonetether-the-smallest-tracking-device-at-long-r">Stone Tether</a> on Kickstarter, have gotten this situation.  And judging by the number of backers and the amount of funding of almost $ 350000 (with a stated $ 15,000 !!!), it took not only them. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c43/431/8ff/c434318ff43148c6a1c404e3c739e4e7.png"><br><br>  Yes, of course, many will say that such trackers have been created before.  Created, but not so.  The range of this baby is 3x3 cm and about 3 mm thick - more than 200 meters.  Now all the trackers of this system are combined into a single network, which means that, so to say, an overgrown population, may well increase the search area, for example, your baggage or the same bag with a laptop to the extent of the city. <br><br>  In addition, a very convenient and informative application for Android and iOS perfectly visualizes the various modes of the tracking system.  For example, if you give a child this device, then even in a shopping center it will not be lost.  You will be notified on the screen of your smartphone about any movements and approaching the border of removal (which you can set within 200 meters yourself). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/395/75f/419/39575f419c664805a06ac1afc50a567e.jpg"><br><br>  <b>Home Sun The Sunn Light</b> <br><br>  Well, that would seem to be squeezed out of the ordinary lamp?  Design, this is understandable.  And functional?  It turns out you can.  And how.  If you approach the issue creatively and from the conceptual position of the "smart home". <br><br>  The fact that light plays an important role in the life of our body, no one will argue.  And, of course, with the advent of artificial light sources, a certain failure in its work occurred.  But what if we recreate the lighting in our interior that is as close as possible in terms of intensity and character to the natural light of the Sun? <br><br>  Obviously, with such a thought in mind, the guys from <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/sunn/sunn-lights-sync-with-the-rhythm-of-the-sun%3Fref%3Dcategory">Sunn</a> began to create an original concept of the lamp with changing brightness of illumination. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e1b/f01/024/e1bf01024c8b407f8962190c946ada49.jpg"><br><br>  We started to start something, but it turned into a very promising project on Kickstarter - it has already raised almost $ 90,000 instead of the stated $ 50,000. <br><br>  The lamp from Sunn is presented in two sizes: 48 cm and 61 cm in diameter.  The light source is a promising LED-lamp, delivering 105 lumens per watt of power at maximum intensity.  Plus a built-in controller with Blutooth, which allows you to synchronize the brightness of the lighting and other additional functions with your device on iOS. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/de0/e7d/f61/de0e7df61c064630bdcb63feff7ebb3a.png"><br><br>  The price in the bundling lamp + application is still announced at $ 299, the remaining purchase options can be viewed on <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/sunn/sunn-lights-sync-with-the-rhythm-of-the-sun%3Fref%3Dcategory">Kickstarter</a> . <br><br>  <b>Smart shower amphiro b1</b> <br><br>  ‚ÄúIsn't it better not just to watch your money flow away with the water in the shower, but to know exactly how much you spent while accepting it?‚Äù - that's probably from such thoughts that new solutions are born for a smart home.  Well, plus the irrepressible geeky passion for optimizing everything around, later creating many useful and not so great inventions. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/1ab/9c3/d1b/1ab9c3d1b7de4fb8b124ebf71b791213.jpg"><br><br>  Whatever it was, but the novelty from <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/amphiro/amphiro-b1-energy-feedback-where-its-most-helpful">Amphiro</a> - a multifunctional water meter amphiro b1 - has confirmed its relevance. <br><br>  Easy to install, intuitive to use, this device really saves your family budget, allowing you to spend money on more useful things, rather than allowing them to simply drain into the sewer.  According to the results of tests in 700 homes during the year (48 thousand shower receptions), the savings amounted to 23%.  Or rather, 430 kW of energy and almost 9 cubic meters of water - and this is almost a two-month consumption rate. <br><br>  And, of course, business didn‚Äôt work without mobile applications √± where today without them. <br>  So to contemplate the results of savings and the approximation to the cherished purchase of the saved funds can be on the screens of their gadgets. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/fd8/6f4/100/fd86f4100df74914a6e20af13d9ca6c8.png"><br><br> <a href="http://litemf.com/ru/price"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/521/d7d/506/521d7d506c53477494e0b40d66252dba.png"></a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/364507/">https://habr.com/ru/post/364507/</a></p>
