  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Assembla - briefly about the main thing</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><h2>  Remote repository and project management system </h2><br>  Assembla provides a convenient service for remote storage of repositories, their management, and the management of the projects to which they belong. <br><br><h3>  Foreword </h3><br>  Good day to all.  I stumbled upon a Habr√© on a topic in which they are asked to advise good remote git repositories.  Unfortunately on Habr√© I recently (I registered, of course, I‚Äôve been his visitor for a very long time), so I couldn‚Äôt answer in the comment (read-only).  So I thought - I will advise in a separate topic, at the same time, I will make a small overview of the additional features of the service that provides this opportunity.  By the way, there you can create not only <u>Git</u> , but also other (for example, <u>SVN</u> ) repositories.  So, enough of the preface - to the point. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h2>  So let's go </h2><br>  This is an English-language, popular (at least for these English-speaking, well, and in our office :)) service, with a web interface, some tools (Time Tracker, comparison of commits, files, and much more, I myself don‚Äôt really understood, because it was not necessary), the ability to administer the project, its team, and a number of different settings.  There are basic and Pro accounts.  Pro, of course, paid, and provides such additional tools as Issue Tracker, Github integration, removal of restrictions, and much more.  This service is located <a href="https://www.assembla.com/">here</a> .

    <h3>  Interface </h3><br><h5>  Starting page, creating a repository and not only </h5><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/cb1/026/751/cb1026751a5ffb02cff1be0ca4d8f977.jpg"><br><br>  After a simple registration procedure, and logging into your account, the interface shown in the figure is available to us. <br>  Here we are shown a list of projects in which we are (if, of course, there are such), briefly any information: invitations, recent commits, some site news, search, help, support, etc.  We also see the menu on top of the site.  There is available a list of our projects (see the following figure), a link to the main page, account access, and various notifications. <br><br>  Perhaps the most important thing for us is the ‚ÄúCreate your own space‚Äù button - that is, create a new space (hereinafter the project), where our project will be located, and, accordingly, the repository.  We press. <br><br>  We see all sorts of links, information, and the choice between private and public repositories (with this, I think, everything is clear - I will not explain, I‚Äôll just say that accessibility can be changed later in the settings, so don‚Äôt bother about it ).  Click "Get Started" - we see a whole list of different options.  In the list, everything that does not begin with Free (for free, but with restrictions), is understandable for a certain amount of money.  We are specifically interested in Free Private Git Repository - click ‚ÄúSelect‚Äù.  The restriction in this case is 1 GIG hard place, and not the availability of some (by and large many unnecessary) tools and options. <br><br>  Then everything is clear and without explanation (by the way, there is also a Security setting - access to our project).  All - created.  They write us unnecessary nonsense - get rid of it, and get into the project we created.  What do we see? <br><br><h5>  Project and tabs </h5><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/7a1/b7c/6ee/7a1b7c6ee31d94c92d1d25cde9e77cb2.jpg"><br><br>  And we see the default tab - ‚Äú <i>Stream</i> ‚Äù (the tab displayed by default and their order can be changed in the settings), which briefly shows when, who, what, who invited whom, in general, all sorts, as it says, ‚ÄúEvents ".  There are search and various filters. <br><br>  Further, the tabs will not explain in detail - everything is clear by name and content.  But, a bit all the same I will tell. <br><br>  The tab " <i>Team</i> ", in which you can raise, lower, invite, kick out, tag users. <br><br>  " <i>Admin</i> " - project settings, information about the used disk space, and some tools ("Tools"), among which you will be offered paid (by the way, there is a 30-day trial if anyone is interested), for example <br><br>  Next, the " <i>Source</i> " tab, which contains a list of branches and a list of files in this branch, as well as possible links to the repository.  There are also sub-tabs, like, look at commits by branches, some tools that I didn‚Äôt use, but someone can come in handy, additional settings and instructions. <br><br>  Well, the last tab is " <i>Upgrade</i> ".  There you can increase the functionality of your account for banknotes or use the trial version. <br><br><h3>  Conclusion </h3><br>  In general, I use this service, and everything in it suits me.  Of course, I would like to, without limitation, in the place on the disk (I don‚Äôt even know why, probably just so that there are no restrictions).  Although 1 GIG headlong enough for most projects.  This is up to you.  Administrators are well supported and updated.  And you - look, try - maybe this is what you were looking for. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/173107/">https://habr.com/ru/post/173107/</a></p>
