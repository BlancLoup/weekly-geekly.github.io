      <i>At our conference there will be two reports devoted to machine translation, and this is not accidental.</i>  <i>In software localization, machine translation has been used for a long time, and perhaps in some areas of living translators, <s>human-like robots</s> will finally replace <s>human-made robots</s> .</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/068/fb8/74d/068fb874ddbe23a729b67aaad9e82a50.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <i><b>Mikhail Vasilyev</b> , Candidate of Medical Science (do not be surprised;)), has been working in this industry since 1988, since 1991 - at IBM, and since 1992 has been working on supporting national languages, as well as translation and localization.</i> <br><br>  Mikhail is the ‚Äúfather‚Äù of the Russian keyboard layout and the Russian version of OS / 2.  From 1995 to the present, he has been heading the IBM Russia / CIS Service Translation Services Center. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/74a/3f9/6a5/74a3f96a5a3d55bdcb09f2d4f2efee0d.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <i>We do not claim that this cat helped Mikhail come up with a Russian-language keyboard layout, but everything can be.</i> <i><br><a name="habracut"></a></i> <br>  In his report, Mikhail will talk about the role of machine translation in software localization.  It will be about the capabilities of modern machine translation systems, their limitations and development prospects, as well as the specifics of their use in software localization processes. <br><br>  It is symbolic that IBM is one of the founders of machine translation - on January 7, 1954, together with Georgetown University, she successfully conducted the first presentation of a new machine translation system at the head office of IBM (New York).  The system was, by modern standards, a toy - it included a dictionary of 250 words and translated 49 pre-selected sentences on chemical topics from Russian into English.  Nevertheless, the presentation spread the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe inevitability of the appearance of machine translation and, in particular, contributed to the financing of research institutes not only in the United States, but throughout the world. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/45b/225/e37/45b225e371d7d075d8b423995420207c.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <i><b>Vladimir Gusarov</b> , director of R &amp; D Moscow branch of Dell.</i> <br><br>  The theme of Vladimir's report is ‚ÄúOrganization of the process of industrial development of a localized software product‚Äù. <br><br>  Vladimir: ‚ÄúYour customers are waiting for the next version of the product with the new functionality, but it still needs to be localized into 15 languages?  We will talk about how to organize the development in such a way that new features in the product appear, and localization does not slow down the process of adding them.  We will also consider the main stages of localization and discuss quality assurance at each of them. ‚Äù <br><br>  In fact, all localizers dream of one thing - so that localization is thought at the stage of product development.  In our opinion, all software developers should listen to this report. <br><br>  There are tens of thousands of companies in the world that provide localization services.  How to determine which ones are best suited to support the international expansion of your company or your business unit?  Can they meet your needs today?  Will they be able to meet your requirements in a year or two?  Are they ready to grow with your business and your needs?  Kirill Solovyov and Sergey Storozhenko have answers to these questions. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ae1/693/56c/ae169356c58e0a91096e9c9f05c1748a.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <i><b>Kirill Soloviev</b> - Acronis localization director.</i>  <i>Kirill leads the Global Localization Team department, which is responsible for the localization of Acronis products, services and content in 14 languages.</i>  <i>Its employees in offices around the world ensure uninterrupted work at all stages of the localization process - from internationalizing the source code and supporting the infrastructure for creating technical content, as well as own software development and introducing new processes and technologies, to working with suppliers, project management, terminology management and testing localized software.</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/005/d7b/997/005d7b997689b89fc3bb16047e2eec83.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <i><b>Sergey Storozhenko</b> , Acronis Localization QA Group Manager, leads the quality assurance team for localized products in Acronis Global Localization Team.</i>  <i>In addition to managing the team and test management in the framework of localization and internationalization, Sergey closely interacts with localization and testing service providers</i> . <br><br>  Here are what the speakers themselves say: ‚ÄúAcronis Global Localization Team, a major international system software vendor, faced the dilemma of choosing a localization service provider in an attempt to increase the scalability of the localization process for software products and technical documentation, while reducing the cost of managing multiple technical translation service providers and localization testing, working on the same project, and in parallel freeing up their internal resources to work on new ones  interesting tasks.  We will tell you about our comprehensive strategic approach to choosing the world's largest providers of a full cycle of software localization services, including the creation of an RFP, primary selection, vendor assessment based on formal criteria and the results of a pilot project, connecting selected suppliers to real projects.  We will also share our agony of choice and the preliminary results of this large-scale project so that the listeners (both localization customers and suppliers) can reap the fruits of our successes and avoid our mistakes. ‚Äù <br><br>  <i>By the way, until the end of preferential <a href="http://lockitconf.ru/">registration for participation in the conference</a> there are just over three days left.</i>  <i>The savings are small, but still.</i> <br><br>  In this post, we want to say thanks to our info sponsors: <br><ul><li>  <a href="http://dtf.ru/">DTF</a> , </li><li>  <a href="http://club.esetnod32.ru/">Eset Club</a> , </li><li>  <a href="http://itmozg.ru/">Itmozg</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://www.cmsmagazine.ru/">CMS Magazine</a> . </li></ul><br>  And we will also show that we are giving away 3 tickets to the conference together with our information sponsors.  2 tickets can be won thanks to Eset Club (read more here: <a href="http://club.esetnod32.ru/forums/view.do%3Fid%3Dt863">http://club.esetnod32.ru/forums/view.do?id=t863</a> ).
