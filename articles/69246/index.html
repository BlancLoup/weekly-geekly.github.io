  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Choice kills</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  I'm torn.  Torn between endless services, information sites, games and hobbies.  I have to monitor several projects, including social networks, in order to keep up with the trend, news from friends.  There used to be 10 acquaintances, now there are 1000 of them. And they are all interesting.  And I'm not talking about reality or the virtual world.  Assess the situation from the point of view of who "creates", and not who "consumes." <br><br>  Every day, countless new startups are born that, in various ways, are trying to attract users.  The population of the planet is not growing as fast as the number of websites.  Of course, some projects are dying, but many remain.  And in their attempts to fight for survival, they adapt to the realities: there are less visitors, and more projects and more attractive projects.  There was one social network - it became 1000, there was one forum - it became 1000, there was an IT information resource - it became 1000. The density of users changes significantly. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>

      Yes, perhaps I, as a reader, have read only 3dnews before, and now I have 20 news publications on topics.  And if earlier I was more interested in participating in the community, in discussing the news, now I have neither the time nor the desire for it.  I would read all the news that interests me, and I simply don‚Äôt have the strength to go into all the comments and opinions left on all these resources. <br><br>  And so in all that relates to the Internet.  I add a post to my blog.  In order to attract attention to him, I automatically or by hands will transmit it to some other resources like Facebook or VKontakte.  But with this, I clearly understand that the audience of my text is scattered throughout the network.  And if earlier an interesting discussion in the comments was conducted in one place, everyone saw it and it was interesting for everyone to participate, now I can observe a modest flow of comments in each location of my post.  And if in one of these places there will be an interesting thread of discussion, then in 10 other sources they will not know about it. <br><br>  A month ago I learned about the new game and quite often it was played in the evenings.  It is really interesting, innovative.  But now, after a month on Habr√©, I read again about the successful project that came out, I go home and start playing it.  Perhaps I have a desire to play at that first game, but I understand that I don‚Äôt have time, because the new one is also interesting. <br><br>  The same thing happened with the cinema.  Before, watching a movie on TV, mom could tell me what would happen next with the story, whether it was interesting or not.  Because before there was no such flow of films.  Now, every evening you can see if not a new film, then at least a new series of the next series.  What you watched yesterday, you can not even remember. <br><br>  All this reminds me of one thing: the other day I heard about stock exchanges, stock prices, players and speculators.  Some clever man noticed that it would be time for everyone to stop thinking only about today's benefits, and think about the future.  Something similar is happening on the Internet. <br><br>  <b>Look at all this from the perspective of who creates all these services for us, the users.</b>  <b>For him, this should definitely be a problem.</b>  <b>It will surely only get worse in the future.</b> <br><br>  I do not call for anything, I do not say everything written about myself (I just like the manner of presentation from the first person).  I simply describe what I see, which often comes to mind in the next situation.  Abundance pampers, it becomes less interesting. <br><br>  <b>PS</b> I understand that Habra is not a place for complaints.  Also here are not welcome posts that lead to nothing, do not have a conclusion, conclusion.  Just my post is focused on focusing on the problem.  Perhaps someone will share their decisions. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/69246/">https://habr.com/ru/post/69246/</a></p>
