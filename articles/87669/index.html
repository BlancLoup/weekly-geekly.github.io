  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Shooting a doublet or Opera "emandes"</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://files.myopera.com/IlyaShpankov/files/mm-header.jpg" alt="image"></div><br><br>  Today Opera browser users have a double holiday - two final versions of browsers are released at once: Opera Mini 5.0 and Opera Mobile 10.0.  And this is not because the developers simply wanted to - the double release hints at an even greater erasure of the distinction between the ‚Äúadult‚Äù mobile version of Opera and its mini ‚Äúsister‚Äù.  For clarity, all the screenshots below will present the same "scenes from the life" of browsers, only on the left it will be the Mini version, and on the right - the Mobile.  Immediately I will explain about the scale: the mobile version had to be slightly reduced to bring it to the same size as the images of Opera Mini - the devices on which Opera Mobile runs usually have a noticeably larger screen. <br><br>  In fact, those who have tried the beta versions of these browsers do not need to tell anything - they were able to pre-evaluate all the delights of new products, so this post will be more interesting for users who prefer stable releases.  And such people can only be envied in their long-suffering: if, since the release of the previous stable version of Opera Mini 4.2, ‚Äújust‚Äù a little more than a year and a quarter (or rather, about 16 months), then the previous Opera Mobile final had the digital designation 8.65 and was presented already in September 2007.  Since then, a lot of water has flowed and many beta versions have changed, and the final releases that haven't tried on the laurels, but what to remember now ... What happened was.  Life goes on, and final releases are inevitable, like the collapse of imperialism.  However, it's time to get down to business. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  So, as you already understood, these two versions of Opera browsers are almost indistinguishable from each other.  However, this ‚Äúalmost‚Äù is very significant - after all, the Mini is still just a client-side Java application, for which the main server turns all its main work, and Mobile does not need help (except for the cases described below), therefore completely without distinction has not done yet.  But we will start with similarities and, by tradition, we will first of all evaluate the interface of the two programs.

    <div style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://files.myopera.com/IlyaShpankov/files/minimob-1.png" alt="image"></div><br><br>  As you can see, both versions are very different from the previous finals, and are almost identical in the new incarnation.  Moreover, they became closer in appearance to the desktop version, which is especially noticeable by the presence of thumbnails of web pages in the Express panel.  Whoever is a little familiar with the history of this operatic function (now successfully adopted by many other browsers), he will remember that it first appeared in the mobile versions of Opera, but was only a list of nine bookmarks that opens at the start of the program.  Then the Express Panel successfully migrated to the desktop version, evolved to visual "thumbnails" and now has returned to the mobile spaces in an already improved form.  In this curious way, sometimes browser functions are developed in Opera.  However, there is nothing surprising in this: the line between ordinary and mobile Internet is thinner every year and the time is not far off when there will be no difference what device to use to view your favorite website.  We at Opera understand this and are almost ready to meet a bright future fully armed. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://files.myopera.com/IlyaShpankov/files/minimob-2.png" alt="image"></div><br><br>  But this is not all that makes mobile versions of Opera browsers similar to each other, and to their desktop relative.  If you dig a little deeper, you can find another important function that has successfully accomplished the evolutionary coil of the same Express panel.  This is the ability to compress all web pages loaded into the browser to increase their opening speed and save traffic.  In Opera Mini, it did not have its own name, once in the desktop version it became Opera Turbo, and now with the new name it came to Opera Mobile.  Yes, from now on, almost all versions of Opera's browser have a built-in accelerator, and owners of expensive smartphones will also be able to finally pay reasonable money for using mobile Internet. <br><br>  And one more function has become universal for all incarnations of Opera browsers - these are visual tabs.  Coming from the desktop version, they very harmoniously fit into the new interface Opera Mini and Mobile. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://files.myopera.com/IlyaShpankov/files/minimob-3.png" alt="image"></div><br><br>  However, you need to be warned that such beauty will be unavailable in Opera Mini for some models of phones that are not very powerful in terms of hardware: here tabs will be presented only tabs without web page thumbnails.  As the saying goes, "medicine is not omnipotent." <br><br>  The ability to customize Opera‚Äôs mobile browsers cannot yet boast the same diversity as in the desktop version, but some progress is being made here.  At least outwardly, there is practically no difference between Mini and Mobile: <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://files.myopera.com/IlyaShpankov/files/minimob-4.png" alt="image"></div><br><br>  Also, do not forget about one of the most important and favorite functions of users - data synchronization.  The ability to work on the Internet from different versions of browsers and from various devices without the need to manually transfer bookmarks, history of visits or the same notes - this is worth a lot.  Honestly, it is already difficult to imagine how different our online environment once was when working on the desktop and mobile phone.  These were virtually parallel worlds that never crossed.  Today, to start reading the article at home, to continue in the subway and complete it in the office is already routine and familiar. <br><br>  But perhaps the most ‚Äútasty‚Äù I left as the final chord of that part of the narration that relates to the similarity between all versions of Opera.  So, attention (drumming, the audience froze in anticipation, the illusionist made a serious face): <br><br>  <b>Starting today, all versions, including Opera Mobile, are completely free.</b> <br><br>  Applause, flowers, screaming "Hurray" and all that.  Yes, our positive experience of free distribution of the desktop version and Opera Mini says that it‚Äôs much less profitable to make money selling the program to the end user than to distribute it for free.  Here is such a paradox of the modern market.  The company, of course, needs funds for its existence and development, but it‚Äôs not the users who will pay - ‚Äúlet it be completely outsiders, not from our area‚Äù. <br><br>  Now we can say a few words about the differences.  In principle, all of them are due to only one reason: the insufficient hardware power of most mobile phones in the lower and middle price category, for which, in fact, the Opera Mini browser was developed at the time.  Naturally, the differences relate to this particular version.  In particular, it does not support flash animation, and video viewing is available only on some phone models and from a rather small list of web services.  Opera Mini also has incomplete support for JavaScript, which does not allow you to fully enjoy the use of Web applications in the style of Web 2.0.  There are no opera widgets here either - the ones that are still puzzled by many users of the desktop version, but actively used by smartphone owners.  Also, the time has not come yet and to present Opera Unite technology on mobile devices.  However, all this - so far, temporarily, not forever.  Technologies are improving, phones are getting closer to the "big" computers in their hardware capabilities, so that relatively soon it really won't matter what device is currently in the user's hands - the Internet will remain the Internet at any place and at any time.  At the very least, we at Opera Software strive to do just that. <br><br>  That's all.  It remains to add that the final version of Opera Mini 5.0 is available for phones that support Java, as well as for Blackberry devices (versions for Android and Windows Mobile are still in beta testing), and the mobile version of Opera Mobile 10.0 is offered to owners of Symbian S60 and Windows platforms Mobile.  You can download these browsers directly to your phone by typing <a href="http://m.opera.com/">this address</a> , or use <a href="http://www.opera.com/mobile/">other methods</a> . <br><br>  Video presentation of new browsers: <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/wWHIGGjiamA%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700021,15700186,15700191,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhhKxfFb185CoNau_tD9XNJV3ZsUIA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DwWHIGGjiamA">Link to the original</a> <br><br>  <b>UPDATE</b> <br>  By the way, about the search engines. <br>  The default is Yandex, but if Google is your default choice on the desktop, then it will also be the default search in Opera Mini when it syncs. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/87669/">https://habr.com/ru/post/87669/</a></p>
