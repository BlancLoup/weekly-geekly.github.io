Today, as promised, we will tell you more about the main feature of the gadget - the Real Pen stylus, which allows you to create notes and sketches, just like in a regular notebook. <br><br> <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/lenovo/blog/281626/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/fa2/778/533/fa2778533790eed67239c3c4a0558c73.png"></a> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  In March of this year, Jeff Meredith, CEO of Lenovo Android and the Chrome Computing Business Group, called the tablets boring.  A whole class of devices needs to be shaken, and this can be done in only one way - to make the models more suitable for specific tasks.  Tablets are convenient for consuming content (watching movies, surfing the web and social networking), but not for creating something new. <br><br>  Lenovo undertook to rectify the situation, the result was the Yoga Book - the original ‚Äútablet‚Äù with the original fastening of the two halves.  The device combines a familiar tablet and a full-fledged thin keyboard, as well as a stylus that imitates an ordinary pen entirely - you can even write on paper.  Unlike other tablets, Yoga Book allows you to create in the most simple and natural form - as if on an ordinary sheet of paper. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/cc5/261/7c0/cc52617c0030b33d5909ea7d8bf1827b.png"><br>  The main goal of the engineering team was to achieve maximum slimness of the gadget - only 9.9 mm.  This is how the ‚ÄúHalo Keyboard‚Äù appeared - a keyboard without physical buttons.  This allowed to get rid of the extra thickness of the tablet.  The developers realized that they could go even further, and added a converter that professional artists and designers use to transfer hand-drawn images to computers.  The converter is usually used with a stylus or electronic pen, but Lenovo wanted a more natural feel when working.  As a result, in conjunction with Wacom feel IT technologies, a pen as close as possible was developed.

      When creating the Yoga Book, it was based on simplicity and at the same time unlimited functionality of a paper notebook.  Think: how do you usually work with a tablet?  Make notes during the presentation, read articles on the Internet, watch the video.  The first natural desire to tag something is to take a simple notebook and pen, because this is still the most intuitive and easy way to record information. <br><br>  Working with Real Pen is as simple as using a normal pen, but with an important amendment - the tablet instantly transforms what you write on paper into digital format.  Suppose you need to explain a working idea, and instead of entering a long text, you can simply draw a graph or a freehand sketch and send it immediately. <br><br>  If it is more convenient to type text, switch to the keyboard with one touch.  It appears only when necessary and is designed to take into account the inconvenience that people have when working with the touch keyboard - the Yoga Book implements a realistic imitation of physical buttons. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/717/df5/63b/717df563b2f53000475fc734e7c00a5a.png"><br>  The work principle of the Yoga Book is the same as in professional solutions for designers.  Drawing on the multi-function keyboard is displayed in a 1: 1 ratio on the main display.  This gives more possibilities for drawing, the hand with the stylus does not obscure your outline.  The stylus is equipped with feedback, and it differs for different tools.  For example, you can feel the difference between using a pen, pencil or brush.  The stylus recognizes 2048 degrees of pressure and 100 different degrees of inclination, which allows you to achieve maximum control and accuracy of a pencil or brush for drawing. <br><br>  Lenovo adopted a non-standard approach to tablet development and applied a number of innovative solutions.  Here's how it all works: <br><br>  Lenovo engineers were able to place Gorilla Glass, an LCD panel, an LED backlight (LGF), an electromagnetic resonance screen (EMR) and a number of system components in a 4 mm-thick case.  The keyboard pad is made of 0.55 mm glass with anti-reflective coating.  For convenience, when typing text, it is made rough.  Under the glass housed the touch panel, which recognizes your touch.  Behind it is an illuminated membrane that simplifies printing in the dark.  And at the very bottom there is an EMR film - it recognizes the movements of the stylus and the pressing force. <br><br>  The design of the device is designed so that all five layers function perfectly.  Here they are: <br><br><blockquote>  <b>The first layer:</b> Gorilla Glass with a thickness of 0.55 mm with anti-reflective coating (matte and fine-grained coating of the best stylus and more convenient printing); <br><br>  <b>Second layer:</b> keyboard touch panel.  It recognizes your actions when typing text; <br><br>  <b>Third layer:</b> LGF backlight; <br><br>  <b>Fourth layer: an</b> EMR film that works with EMR technology to read movements while working with a stylus.  Created with the participation of Wacom feel IT technologies; <br><br>  <b>Motherboard:</b> processor, memory, battery and other components. </blockquote><br>  Electromagnetic induction technology is used in the stylus.  Waves follow from the sensor, receiving feedback signals from the stylus.  These signals are processed by algorithms, which allows you to convert written into digital format. <br><br>  <b>The transition from keyboard to notebook:</b> when the keyboard is not active, the surface becomes a notebook.  With the push of the power button on the stylus, the EMR film comes into play, the layout is deactivated with the backlight.  When the stylus is turned off, the handwriting mode is turned off, and the familiar keyboard reappears. <br><br>  <b>Like paper: a</b> multi-function keyboard conveys the feel of paper when you write on it.  Lenovo designers spent a year and a half and created more than one hundred surface prototypes with anti-reflective coating to achieve maximum realism. <br><br>  <b>Write as usual with a pen:</b> according to the idea, the stylus should have worked like a classic ink pen.  The Lenovo team did not want to use the battery in the stylus.  And the pen fully justifies its name - Real Pen.  She can write on plain paper and on the touch panel.  The developers have thought of a quick and easy ink refill.  Lenovo created about two hundred samples before choosing the most suitable option. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/d51/3d1/354/d513d13546bec45165a2578056f43f0b.png"><br><br>  <b>Handwriting on screen:</b> Finally, Lenovo wanted to link AnyPen technology with EMR so that users could write on the display itself.  Engineers have chosen Polyformaldehyde (POM), which adjusts the touch pad and top screen for optimal signal-to-noise ratio.  There were also a few magnetic parts that could disturb the stability of the signal and interfere with the operation of the digital converter, but managed to find the optimal solution.  After many tests, Lenovo engineers have achieved an excellent result. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/369781/">https://habr.com/ru/post/369781/</a></p>
