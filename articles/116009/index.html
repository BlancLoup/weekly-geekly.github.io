This device was made by defense industry enterprises, such as Raytheon, due to their experience in producing magnetrons, powerful vacuum chambers that generate microwaves for radar systems.  Now, marketers claimed that the magnetron is absolutely necessary in every home, restaurant, and so on.  It can heat food faster, uses less energy and is less likely to burn your home than a regular brass stove.  And it costs a little less than $ 500.  Need to buy no questions, right? <br><br>  However, many consumers still have questions.  First, what the hell do we need another way to heat food?  The kitchen already has an oven and gas stove, plus a toaster, waffle iron, grill in the backyard.  And the coffee pot does not allow the coffee to cool.  Why do we need another oven?  Plus, this new appliance will definitely not work as an oven or as a stove.  This is something in between.  Why is it needed? <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  If you just look at the specifications, the microwave for many had no meaning.  Therefore, manufacturers began to supply it with special cookbooks with a list of detailed recipes for what and how you could cook.  Look, you can make a wonderful Chinese dish in the microwave!  Our microwaves will help bake the cake!  Want a hot cup of this sophisticated flavored cider?  In just 15 steps, you can cook it in our microwave oven!  They thought that the microwave should be sold as a full-fledged large oven. <br><br>  But a miracle of wonders, people began to buy microwaves and use them constantly.  Considering this product in the store, many did not feel the mandatory need to buy it, but as soon as they made it part of their daily life, it became indispensable.  How else can you warm up the leftovers?  Of course, people tried crazy, complicated recipes, but mostly they found new ways to use a microwave oven.  It should not be a full oven or gas stove;  This is a fundamentally new class of kitchen appliances, which allowed even the most worthless chefs in the world to cook.  No one would have ever put the oven in a hotel room, and the microwave was great there for the place.

      Microwave does not facilitate the usual work in the kitchen.  Preparation of complex dishes takes probably more time.  Probably you will not make it dishes, which will take the top prize, if it is not just a competition in the microwave kitchen.  But with its help, it became easier to cook simple dishes, and consumers around the world have recognized it as an absolutely necessary kitchen appliance for several years when it became popular. <br><br>  Last year, Apple introduced the iPad, a computing device that many find it difficult to attribute to some class.  It is larger than a smartphone or iPod, smaller than a computer, but it can take on some of the tasks that you would otherwise do on those devices.  You can print the document in Pages or find your way on GPS and Google Maps.  So what makes it so special?  In terms of specifications, tablets have no meaning.  They cost a little less than $ 500, but if you already bought a computer or smartphone, then this is just another waste of money.  In addition, you can buy a netbook for $ 300, right? <br><br>  Everyone thought that the success of the iPad needed traditional computer programs.  After all, if you can't start Office, then why is it even needed?  And so Apple ported iWork applications for iPad and surprisingly managed to achieve the highest possible office productivity, which is only possible on the touchscreen.  VNC programs were all the rage, browsers with tabs, and everything else that you can think of to make the iPad like a regular PC. <br><br>  And then users bought them, brought them home - and something special happened.  They realized that it was very convenient to read e-books from the tablet and surf the Internet without getting up from the sofa.  They found that those things that they would never have thought of doing on a PC, became simple and fun.  Applications that did not make sense on a computer with a keyboard and mouse, like GarageBand, finger-drawing and e-books, suddenly found life on a 9.7-inch tile made of glass and metal.  The Flipboard reader would never become as popular on the desktop, and who would make the Twitter interface for the iPad without the iPad itself?  People who have never touched a computer in their lives have unexpectedly discovered a lot of ways that computers can make their lives easier, and technicians who spend 10+ hours a day opposite blinded monitors are now easier to break away from their powerful PCs.  But do not do the same thing, and other innovative things that would not have occurred to you on a traditional PC with a monitor, keyboard and mouse on the table.  As Marco Arment said, <a href="http://www.marco.org/3836678176">the time has come to abandon office programs</a> ;  because the iPad opens the door to all kinds of creative, interactive, personalized programs.  In the end, the <a href="http://daringfireball.net/2011/03/the_chair">term "personal computer" has finally gained meaning</a> . <br><br>  The world has discovered that for the success of the iPad it does not have to be a full-fledged computer.  This is a new form factor, thanks to which computing has become more accessible than ever to most people.  Of course, you cannot write code on it, and Photoshop for iOS has not yet come out.  Steak medium fried in the microwave, you also do not cook.  But now, while waiting for the download of your aging desktop, you can read the news, type a short document and do your daily activities.  And for millions of people, the iPad will become the primary computer device;  there is simply no reason why they need e-mail more complicated than a couple of taps on the screen of a device that lives several days of normal work on one charge. <br><br>  Think it looks exactly like preheating the oven, instead of pressing ‚ÄúQuickly 2‚Äù in the microwave to warm the food ... <br><br>  <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259C%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BA%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BB%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B0%25D1%258F_%25D0%25BF%25D0%25B5%25D1%2587%25D1%258C">Microwave history on wikipedia</a> <br><br>  <i>All this is wonderful, but you can cook in the microwave any products, and not just special products with which farmers paid 30% tax to the microwave oven manufacturer.</i>  <i>- approx.</i>  <i>per.</i> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/116009/">https://habr.com/ru/post/116009/</a></p>
