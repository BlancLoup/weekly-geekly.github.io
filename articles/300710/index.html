      <b>‚ÄúMigration‚Äù to Mobile</b> <br><br>  The latest data from the Outbrain study shows that <b>content consumption on mobile devices is growing rapidly.</b>  <b>In the US, almost half of people (44%) prefer viewing content on mobile devices</b> , and this figure is increasing every year. <br><br>  Mary Meeker, a US venture capitalist and former Wall Street securities analyst, in the Internet Trends Report study notes that an <b>average American adult spends 5.6 hours every day on the Internet ‚Äî three of them exclusively on a mobile phone</b> .  Miker notes that in a trend - the transition from long user sessions on the Internet several times a day to shorter sessions more times per day. <br>  <b>Analysis of the consumer mindset of mobile content</b> <br><br>  A recent study by Pollfish, the leading platform for in-depth global online surveys via mobile apps, featuring Mobile Marketing Watch, revealed that consumers on mobile devices are increasingly ‚Äúcraving‚Äù for games, video and social content. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d9d/c4a/800/d9dc4a8009874b899d76b0124cc72401.jpg"><br><br>  <b>Development of the ‚Äúgame‚Äù strategy</b> <br><br>  Initially, the prerequisites for moving to a mobile were attempts by companies to redo their desktop websites.  And the success of such steps are not particularly crowned. <br><br>  Now it is no secret that this scheme does not work.  There is a fundamental difference in the consumption of content on the desktop and on mobile devices.  The most progressive marketers are already openly saying that the era of ‚Äúmobile-first‚Äù has come, when people will use the Internet, first of all, through mobile devices. <br><br>  Ray Behhari, Associate Professor of Marketing at New York University, says: <br><br>  <i>‚ÄúAccepting mobile thinking doesn‚Äôt mean reaching consumers through advertising on mobile devices.</i>  <i>Consumers want to get the most detailed content that meets their requirements - get what they want, when they want, and in the format that they want.</i>  <i>And mobie-first will help in this. ‚Äù</i> <br><br>  How to act? <br><br>  1. <b>Focus on the mobile.</b> <br><br>  2. <b>Accept the need to create mobile versions of sites other than desktop ones</b> .  Mobile screens less time to ‚Äúcapture‚Äù attention less.  The combination of shorter texts with bright ‚Äúcatchy‚Äù images will give the best result. <br><br>  3. <b>To be aware of new mobile technologies</b> .  The emergence of new tools opens up greater opportunities for marketers to get benefits.  The very essence of mobile platforms is based on personalization, and this is information about interconnected applications, locations and other indicators of user behavior.  All this data makes it much easier for marketers to adapt content to the needs of consumers. <br><br>  4. <b>Constantly analyze the results and improve the mobile site on the basis of the analysis obtained</b> .  Companies need to be prepared to spend time and resources on testing the performance of certain "chips", as well as to respond in time to incoming feedback.  What do people click on the most?  What is being ignored?  All these actions require in-depth consideration. <br><br>  What points need to be considered when creating content for mobile sites?  Let's designate the main ones. <br><br>  <b>Shorter text</b> .  Mobile devices a priori suggest that users enter them while on the road or during business breaks.  Therefore, it is not necessary to write huge texts, the reading of which takes a significant amount of time.  The text should be short, easy to read and relevant. <br><br>  <b>Attractive headlines</b> .  They should ‚Äúkindle‚Äù the interest of readers and awaken the desire to read the text completely. <br><br>  <b>Picture.</b>  <b>One image can really ‚Äúcost‚Äù a thousand words.</b>  Mobile users react positively to ‚Äúcatchy‚Äù, spectacular images and bright ‚Äúbold‚Äù colors. <br><br>  <b>Video</b> is another important detail that becomes an integral part of a successful mobile site.  Jason Demers, founder and CEO of AudienceBloom, draws attention to the importance of using micro-video.  For example, a six-second video is much more effectively able to convey the essence of the marketing message than the text. <br><br>  To summarize, <b>mobile-first must be put at the forefront of developing a successful business.</b>  <b>This approach will significantly improve communication with consumers, move to deeper levels of interaction, taking into account the personal characteristics and desires of each client.</b> <b><br></b> <br><br> <a href="http://www.byyd.me/ru/register/%3Futm_source%3Dmegamozg%26utm_medium%3Dpost%26utm_campaign%3Dcontent_marketing"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/041/3c5/29a/0413c529a1424210a02b160e54a40e80.png"></a> <br><br>  <a href="http://www.byyd.me/ru/%3Futm_source%3Dmegamozg10052016"><b>BYYD ‚Ä¢ Mobile Advertising Platform</b></a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/300710/">https://habr.com/ru/post/300710/</a></p>
