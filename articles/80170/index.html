  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Another ‚Äúlesson‚Äù on ExtJS. Item Templates</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Hello to all!  First of all I want to congratulate you on Christmas!  Happiness to all and health! <br>  Secondly, I want to inform those who are interested that I posted another <a title="6th lesson on ExtJS. Item Templates" href="http://newpg.ru/documentation/extjs/extjs/lesson6.html">ExtJS lesson</a> on <a title="Web Studio &amp; laquo; New Paradigm &amp; raquo;" href="http://newpg.ru/">my site</a> , in which we will try to deal with the templates of elements. <br>  In general, I would immediately like to note the following fact: with the last post, one small nuisance turned out - many Habrapiplians tried to convince me that I was doing Evil, that I underestimated the threshold for entering sacral technologies and did a disservice to those who, as a result of studying my clumsy lessons, completely loses the chance to become a normal coder.  In this regard, I want to immediately identify a few points: <br>  1) I fully admit that there were quite a few really good specialists in this field, nevertheless, I ask you to continue not to waste your time on such beliefs, because firstly, I do not agree with you, and secondly, lay out more adequate lessons and the need for my crooked lessons will disappear immediately by itself. <br>  2) I repeat once again that my lessons do not pretend to the title of authoritative manuals.  For me, programming is a hobby, and my knowledge is more dilettan, and the vision is the same, because the lexicon and examples are relevant.  But it is quite possible precisely for this reason that it is easier for a beginner to understand them than to immediately plunge into learning the official docks in the bourgeois language.  Therefore, if you have a deep knowledge of programming, you are unlikely to find something new in my material, unless you want to pour dirt and show how cool a coder you are against other ignoramuses.  Do not!  So we know that.  Therefore, do not flood in vain.  Here is material for beginners and those for whom coding is a hobby. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  3) To say that my material is not needed by anyone, I can not.  Here are the statistics from my site for 3 days: <br>  a) Unique users: 532 people (not much of course, but not empty). <br>  b) Views 2655, that is, on average, everyone made at least 5 clicks, which means he did not leave right away from the main page <br>  c) According to Google, the average length of stay on the site is 5 minutes 24 seconds, which is also not a trifle. <br>  d) Evaluation by users of the laid out material (Number of votes / Evaluation / Lesson): <br><br>  10, 'Good, but too much water.', 'ExtJS.  Lesson 1. Hello, world! ' <br>  7, 'Great!  Very helpful! ',' ExtJS.  Lesson 1. Hello, world! ' <br>  4, "A lot of mistakes.", "ExtJS.  Lesson 1. Hello, world! ' <br>  3, 'Good, but it would be possible in more detail.', 'ExtJS.  Lesson 1. Hello, world! ' <br>  11, 'Great!  Very helpful! ',' ExtJS.  Lesson 2. Windows' <br>  6, 'Good, but too much water.', 'ExtJS.  Lesson 2. Windows' <br>  5, 'I knew everything then.  Nothing new. ',' ExtJS.  Lesson 2. Windows' <br>  3, "A lot of mistakes.", "ExtJS.  Lesson 2. Windows' <br>  3, 'Good, but it would be possible in more detail.', 'ExtJS.  Lesson 2. Windows' <br>  6, 'Good, but it would be possible in more detail.', 'ExtJS.  Lesson 3. Windows, part two <br>  5, 'Good, but too much water.', 'ExtJS.  Lesson 3. Windows, part two <br>  1, 'I knew everything then.  Nothing new. ',' ExtJS.  Lesson 3. Windows, part two <br>  1, 'Great!  Very helpful! ',' ExtJS.  Lesson 3. Windows, part two <br>  3, 'Good, but it would be possible in more detail.', 'ExtJS.  Lesson 4. Windows, part three ' <br>  1, "A lot of mistakes.", "ExtJS.  Lesson 4. Windows, part three ' <br>  1, 'I knew everything then.  Nothing new. ',' ExtJS.  Lesson 4. Windows, part three ' <br>  1, 'Good, but too much water.', 'ExtJS.  Lesson 4. Windows, part three ' <br>  1, 'Great!  Very helpful! ',' ExtJS.  Lesson 4. Windows, part three ' <br>  4, 'I knew everything then.  Nothing new. ',' ExtJS.  Lesson 5. Storage and tables' <br>  4, 'Good, but too much water.', 'ExtJS.  Lesson 5. Storage and tables' <br>  3, 'Good, but it would be possible in more detail.', 'ExtJS.  Lesson 5. Storage and tables' <br>  2, 'Great!  Very helpful! ',' ExtJS.  Lesson 5. Storage and tables' <br>  2, "A lot of mistakes.", "ExtJS.  Lesson 5. Storage and tables' <br><br>  Evaluating this statistic I want to say: yes, not everything is smooth, but the material cannot be called useless!  Therefore, I will make a conclusion: do not waste your and other people's time on attempts to underestimate others' work, better do something useful :-)

      It was an introductory type :-) but in the past there were actually 93 comments, of which I find it difficult to call at least 10 constructive, and I cannot just ignore someone else‚Äôs comment and not respond to what was noted, while also reproaching me you see, you spent 3 hours on me explaining what Evil I am doing and explaining to me that every normal prog can only get to everything, which I do not believe. <br><br>  So, to the point: on the site I posted <a title="6th lesson on ExtJS. Item Templates" href="http://newpg.ru/documentation/extjs/extjs/lesson6.html">the 6th lesson on ExtJS</a> .  In it, I tried to consider the issue of managing the templates (layouts) of elements in ExtJS.  Personally, in my opinion, the material is complex, and I still do not quite freely swim in it, because the lesson is no longer a lesson, but rather thinking in the ear.  But to judge you again.  I really hope someone thread material will be useful. <br><br>  Sincerely, I <br><br></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/80170/">https://habr.com/ru/post/80170/</a></p>
