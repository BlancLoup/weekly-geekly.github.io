But there are very few articles about how big companies create their startups.  And they really create. <br><br>  I would like to tell you about a full-cycle online store selling digital indoor advertising <a href="http://vireklama.ru/">vireklama.ru</a> , which is a start-up of Russia's largest advertising <a href="http://vireklama.ru/">retailer</a> , Video International, in which I actually work on this project. <br><br><h2>  Bit of education </h2><br>  Advertising screens (digital indoor) - these are televisions that hang in supermarkets, shopping malls, airports and show advertising.  I think you all saw and heard them at Crossroads, Pyaterochka, Mege or Airport.

    <img src="http://vireklama.ru/binaries/images/62995.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Video International is the leader in Russia in this kind of advertising, selling advertising opportunities on more than 10,000 screens in 90 cities.  But to order advertising on them for small and medium-sized entrepreneurs was not so easy.  To date. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  About the team </h2><br>  Despite the fact that the VI company is very large, not many people are working on this project: <br><br>  - Technical Director <br>  - project coordinator <br>  - business analyst <br>  - accountant <br>  - lawyer <br>  - financial director <br>  - and of course the CEO <br><br>  This ‚Äúmanagement‚Äù team sets tasks, thinks out the strategy for developing the service, and deals with other organizational things.  There is also a team of performers: <br><br>  - programmer <br>  - flasher <br>  - coder <br>  - tester <br>  - sys.adminstrator <br>  - manager <br><br>  This is a team from the company Ailav, which deals respectively with the embodiment of ideas. <br><br>  If it seems to someone that it is a lot, that, probably, never worked in the big company :-) <br>  In general, it turns out quite a mobile group that quickly and effectively solves all problems. <br><br><h2>  About the service </h2><br>  So, what is the service.  Actually, this is an online store selling one single product: advertising on digital indoor screens. <br><br>  When creating the service, we were guided by only one goal: to make the advertiser as comfortable as possible, without getting up from his workplace, to advertise his product or service. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/7ff/6c7/a1d/7ff6c7a1dbedf8eb56927716d79bd187.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The user can set up this product for himself.  To do this, we came up with a system of 5 convenient steps to create your own advertising campaign: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e3f/fb8/5df/e3ffb85df720d6509ab58e4ced262b91.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The customer himself can choose the date of the campaign placement, upload or even create his video (I will tell below), target advertising (up to a certain store) and independently select the cost of the campaign to fit their capabilities. <br><br>  And the targeting is very accurate for offline: you can choose a city (I spoke above about 90 cities), a district, a street and a store.  We even made a map for this based on Google Maps. <br><br>  After creating a campaign, you can pay for it with a card or through a bank, and after checking by our managers (compliance with the requirements of the Law, correctness, etc.), the campaign will be launched on time and you will be able to track status, and even better walk to the store where you placed advertising, and see firsthand. <br><br>  The main advantages will be understood by any person who has ever tried to place his advertisement - everything is as simple as possible and no pieces of paper!  In general, the service is designed for small entrepreneurs and private individuals (yes, you can place a greeting for your beloved near the house :-). <br><br>  The scale, of course, is impressive - you can place your ad right away in 90 cities on almost 10,000 screens! <br><br><h2>  And now the highlight </h2><br>  I have already mentioned above that the user can create a commercial for himself.  So here we have a special video mixer tool, in which you can choose one of the templates and create your own full-fledged video based on it. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/29b/b43/999/29bb439992f3df923eb8304f961a719d.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The functionality of the editor is not as great as we would like, you can change the texts and images, as well as their location.  However, you can create a truly unique movie. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a2e/865/e23/a2e865e2370cd18d86cf7d1fdcee7987.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  There, everything is quite simple and a person without special knowledge can easily create a video advertising its product or service, and for free. <br><br>  The whole switcher is made on Adobe Flash, as we would like, but there are no competitors to this platform in the mass segment today. <br><br>  By the way, I still haven‚Äôt found any analogues on the global Internet; if someone can tell, I will be very grateful. <br><br><h2>  In conclusion </h2><br>  In general, we now have a completely finished product and, most importantly, the monetization of this product is absolutely transparent.  Of course, we still have some shortcomings, shortcomings, but this is only the beginning! <br><br>  Probably, all this is not as original as breakthrough startups doing on the knee in garages, but I wanted to show that even in a large IT company, if desired, a small group of people is enough to do something interesting on the Internet. <br><br>  I think we can do it. <br><br>  <b>UPD.</b>  By the way, we have a <a href="http://vireklama.ru/users/login/%3Fdemo">guest mode</a> , for those who are interested to see. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/100965/">https://habr.com/ru/post/100965/</a></p>
