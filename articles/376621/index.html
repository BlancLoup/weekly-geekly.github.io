One of the mysteries is a large cloud over the southern latitudes of Mars, which was located at an altitude of 250 kilometers for 11 days, starting from March 12, 2012.  This phenomenon was <a href="http://www.nature.com/news/martian-mystery-cloud-defies-explanation-1.16924">first discovered by amateur astronomers</a> .  The width of the "cloud" then was about 1000 kilometers, and every day the object changed shape, and the geometrical dimensions changed. <br><br>  The cloud was observed for 11 days.  Observations from April 2 of the same year did not reveal any clouds.  But already in the photographs of April 6 a similar object was discovered, which existed for about 10 days.  Now a team of astronomers has decided to find an explanation for this phenomenon.  But it was not so easy. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/a93/a66/cbb/a93a66cbb3b2c5142dcc35f6f103d89e.gif">

      Scientists found archival images, and began to examine them, trying to find a solution to a scientific problem.  It is worth noting that the photos were obtained by various amateur astronomers, who did not have the strongest telescopes at their disposal.  Scientists have examined and Hubble images, and found about the same formation on Mars, in photographs from 1997. <br><br><h3>  What could it be? </h3><br><br>  Several theories have been put forward at once, and one of them says that clouds can really be what they look like.  The fact is that all observed formations have arisen in the terminator zone, the line in which day and night converge.  <a href="http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn26983-mystery-cloudlike-blobs-over-mars-baffle-astronomers.html%3Ffull%3Dtrue">Scientists have suggested</a> that the "cloud" - is frozen carbon dioxide and water particles in the upper regions of the atmosphere of Mars. <br><br>  Such an explanation has a right to exist, but it does not explain how carbon dioxide and water droplets reached such a height.  On Earth, the maximum height of the observed clouds is 80 kilometers.  Such clouds are extremely rare, and appear over the polar regions. <br><br>  As for Mars, here it is difficult to say anything. <br><br><h3>  Northern Lights </h3><br><br>  Yes, there is such a theory.  Its author believes that the "cloud" is the northern lights that emerged in the southern latitudes of Mars under the influence of two factors: local magnetic anomalies and the action of the sun.  True, if this is so, then the northern lights on Mars should be 1000 times brighter than the northern lights on Earth.  In addition, the solar flare should be very strong, and in 2012 nothing like this was observed. <br><br><h3>  So what is it? </h3><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/579/60c/a77/57960ca770f786a7d18a2808b72fe9f0.jpg" width="700"><br><br>  Scientists do not yet know.  Despite the fact that Mars seems to be well studied, the reason for the appearance of such strange objects is unknown.  Someone is already joking about the manifestation of the activity of the Martians, but this is just a joke. <br><br>  Now in Mars orbit, new stations have appeared, including the American MAVEN and the Indian Mangalyaan.  These two probes will be able to detect "clouds" at the very beginning of their birth, since the devices are studying the atmosphere of Mars, and are equipped with all the necessary scientific equipment. <br><br>  In addition, in 2018, it is planned to send new rovers, which may also be able to clarify the cause of the appearance and nature of high-altitude "clouds" on Mars. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/376621/">https://habr.com/ru/post/376621/</a></p>
