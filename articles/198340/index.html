  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Standard charge for laptops</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Every year millions of chargers get to the landfills, new ones are produced, which will then again end up in landfills.  And on workplaces of users as a rule full habrakhabr from wires.  If there are several laptops in the house from different manufacturers, then you have to watch what kind of charging is in front of you or look for your own when moving from place to place.  And not the fact that charging from the old model of the laptop will fit the new laptop of the same manufacturer. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ba6/765/273/ba67652730e93884c1a67d30ec3f9872.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Anyone in their right mind understands that they need to do something and unify the chargers at last.  On the part of the manufacturers, the matter does not shift beyond the constructive ‚Äúblah blah blah‚Äù.  No wonder: who wants to lose a solid sum of profits from the sale of chargers?  Well, let them cost at least 10 rubles, but they fail regularly, but they get lost more often. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h1>  The situation with mobile phones </h1><br>  Talk about creating a single charge for phones has been going on since 2007. At first, EU industry commissioner Gunther Verheugen behaved quite peacefully - just stated in the press that, they say, mobile phone manufacturers had an abyss of time to develop a single "charge ‚ÄúAnd why they haven‚Äôt done it yet - truly a mystery sealed.  But then his patience exploded, and Verkhogen promised to take extremely strict measures and apply severe sanctions (read: impressive fines) to vendors who cannot find a common language.  Two days later, market participants announced that they agreed with his initiative.

      Users accepted the standard extremely positively.  There are rumors that soon, the EU authorities will oblige to release a universal charger for laptops and digital cameras. <br>  Then the manufacturers of laptops Acer and Asus, as well as electronics assemblers Quanta Computer, Compal Electronics, Wistron, Pegatron Technology and Inventec <a href="http://www.shtuka.biz/news2/full.php%3Fc%3D32%26n%3D698524">supported the idea of</a> creating a universal charger initiated by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE), which formed a team of specialists for these purposes. <br><br><h1>  What to do? </h1><br>  It's been two and a half years, and things have been there.  It is clear that the support of this initiative on the part of the manufacturers of power supplies will be in every possible way slowed down (after all, their sales will start to decline), we will have to force them. <br>  It will not move here without state regulation.  Let's hope that we have our own Verkhogen.  I ask legally competent habrayuzerov help compile a text for the initiative on the IC. <br><br>  Approximate content of the initiative <br> <code>          .    ‚Äî    ,     ,    .  ,        ,         ¬´       ...¬ª <br> <br>       ,     . <br>   ,            .        .      : <br> <br>  , <br>  , <br>   <br></code> <br> <code>: <br>   ,    ,         (IEEE ?),  .

The environmental impact of a product is determined in the early stages of design.  Creating innovative products, Acer pays great attention to environmental protection.  This helps the company to minimize environmental damage, as well as reduce the energy consumption of Acer products ... <br>  ... By continually improving the environmental friendliness of products, Acer also improves its methods of presenting customers with information about its products, making it easily accessible, understandable, standardized and easy to compare.  Acer adheres to the Environmental IT Declaration methodology, developed in 1996 by the Swedish Association of IT Industry.  ... <br>  ... Since 2005, all Acer products comply with the WEEE directive (WEEE - Waste Electrical &amp; Electronic Equipment).  Acer's environmental, health and safety policies are a reflection of its commitment to providing products and services that are sustainable throughout its life cycle.  Over the past ten years, IT recycling programs and their components have been introduced.  Recyclable items typically include laptops, hard drives, power supplies, PC circuit boards, enclosures, and monitors.  Acer is also taking part ... <br><br><h4>  <a href="http://www.asus.com/ru/About_ASUS/GreenASUS/">Asus</a> Environmental Policy </h4><br>  ASUS strives to make the world better for everyone by offering high-quality and eco-friendly products ... The GreenASUS concept provides an opportunity to develop innovations and technologies in harmony with nature and, thus, make our planet cleaner and greener for the benefit of all its inhabitants <br><br>  ... In 2007, following a study of the computer and peripheral market conducted by the German company Oekom, ASUS was recognized as ‚Äúa company with the most friendly environmental policy‚Äù.  In October 2008, ASUS products won nine EPEAT Gold Medals.  Thereby, ASUS became the first Taiwanese manufacturer of IT equipment to receive this prestigious award.  ASUS is also proud of the fact that its laptops are the first among the products of all international suppliers that have passed the EU Flower certification. <br><br>  <b>Update 1:</b> in the <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/198340/">comments it was</a> <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/198340/">proposed</a> to leave several ‚Äúsizes‚Äù of charge: a small low-power one with a small connector, which is enough for any netbook and ultrabook, and more powerful for powerful and large laptops, respectively. <br>  Of course, this is an option, but according to <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/198340/">sdvn</a> , it is enough to install a single connector, a single voltage, for example, 24V, will be enough for everyone with excess, and it will be enough to teach weak devices to operate at a higher voltage. <br>  I think this is a more universal solution.
