This is not discussed.  And the presence of broadband and mobile Internet makes us accessible almost around the clock. <br><br>  However, did you notice that <b>people who constantly talk about their own employment are in fact the least effective</b> ?  Being very busy does not mean to be effective or successful. <a name="habracut"></a>  Some people like to tell others about their own employment, so that no one even thinks of ‚Äúhanging‚Äù another task on them.  Others thus prove their own importance.

      If you belong to the list of those who, at any opportunity, tell others about ‚Äúunimaginable‚Äù employment, or you feel a constant workload - you probably don‚Äôt simply know such a science as <b>‚Äútime management‚Äù</b> . <br><br>  Naturally, we will not write about all its subtleties due to the limited size of the article.  But some points to improve their own efficiency, we still denote.  Moreover, everyone has a big and, we hope, productive work week ahead. <br><br>  Well, let's get started. <br><br>  <b>1. Do not say "yes" to everyone and everything</b> <br><br>  First of all, it concerns work tasks.  If your schedule is so full, do not agree with the new task just to please the boss.  Your efficiency from this will only decrease.  Instead of fulfilling one big task qualitatively, you will be ‚Äútorn‚Äù for several projects.  As a result - <b>poor</b> - <b>quality execution, non-compliance with the deadline.</b>  <b>Stress.</b> <br><br>  <b>2. Leave time on family and friends</b> <br><br>  Appreciate your loved ones.  Be sure to leave time for them.  You can't always think about work.  The brain must be given unloading.  Spending time with family and friends is ideal for this.  Or at least just call them to give your thoughts a break from work. <br><br>  <b>3. Set priorities</b> <br><br>  Always evaluate which tasks from your list are more important, and do not waste time on those that can "wait."  For example, it is not at all necessary to constantly check emails or accounts in social networks - this can be given a certain amount of time.  You do not have to answer everyone URGENTLY (of course, there are exceptions, but, as a rule, no one requires instant business answers).  First complete the task you are working on, and then calmly proceed to answering letters or calls.  You can't do everything at the same time. <br><br>  <b>4. Do not let others distract you</b> <br><br>  Focus on the task.  And don't let colleagues or anyone else distract you until you complete it.  Or until your legal break comes.  If you work according to this scheme, you will soon notice that the task takes less time than usual. <br><br>  <b>5. Get enough sleep and take breaks</b> <br><br>  If you do not sleep enough, fatigue will gradually build up, and the effectiveness will inexorably decrease.  Attention concentration will ‚Äúcrawl‚Äù down, and as a result, without even noticing it, you will spend much more time on seemingly ordinary work tasks, not to mention serious projects that require maximum return.  Therefore, try to sleep at least 7-8 hours a day.  Do not forget to take breaks during the working day.  This will allow to ‚Äúrefresh‚Äù the mind and do the work faster and with better quality. <br><br>  Well, know yourself by reading our article?  Do you use anything from the above list in your professional activity? <br><br>  Or maybe you have your own personal charter of rules, which allows you to achieve success?  We will be glad to hear any opinion in the comments.
