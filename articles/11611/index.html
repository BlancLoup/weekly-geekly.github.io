  <section class="page js-page"><h1>10 main methods of success in the Internet business</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  After analyzing the blogs of many people involved in the Internet business, I have identified several methods that will help beginners in the Internet business.  These methods do not pretend to any laws in this craft, but they work for many successful moneymakers.  So. <br><a name="habracut"></a><ol><li>  <strong>Copy working themes.</strong> <br>  If you see that a person ‚Äúhas a theme‚Äù, then try to do the same as he does.  Usually the likelihood that you also succeed, tends to 100%. <br></li><li>  <strong>Look for "your" chips.</strong> <br>  Despite the fact that you can simply copy other people's topics, however, you need to try to look for something of your own.  Try to advertise with other keywords, try to correct a niche or change the source of traffic.  In general, experiment. <br></li><li>  <strong>Look for accomplices.</strong> <br>  No sensible project works without partners.  It is extremely difficult to engage in a project alone.  It is much easier to unleash several projects together, supporting each other than trying to prove to everyone that you are the best! <br></li><li>  <strong>Organize a scheme for receiving money.</strong> <br>  The cornerstone of the entire Internet business.  If you enter into some topic, then try to immediately understand how to extract money from this topic.  Look at interest rates on commissions, clarify all the nuances in the tax, analyze where it is more profitable for you to open an account, etc. <br></li><li>  <strong>"Patience and a little effort".</strong> <strong><br></strong>  You should not panic right away if this or that topic does not work for you.  Just try to analyze exactly where you have ‚Äúshoals‚Äù.  Sometimes it may be that the server simply does not work well or your domain has been banned by search engines or simply use the wrong affiliate ID.  Talk to more experienced people (especially if you are their referrals, they will always help). <br></li><li>  <strong>Try to create your own network of affiliates.</strong> <br>  Your affiliates are an investment in your future.  Even when you retire, affiliates will consistently bring you 10-20% of your income.  Train your affiliates, give them bonuses, like <a href="http://www.affiliatebunker.com/">IzhBomzh</a> does. <br></li><li>  <strong>Understand</strong> <strong>SEO.</strong> <br>  Be sure to try to understand the basics of website promotion.  Website promotion is one of the main sources of income for many people.  Millions of dollars are invested in this area.  Therefore, so that people go to your sites, learn the basic methods of driving traffic to the site.  Visit the <a href="http://forum.searchengines.ru/">search engine optimization forum</a> and ask your questions there. <br></li><li>  <strong>Create a network of sites.</strong> <br>  Be sure to make yourself pieces of 10 sites from which you will receive income.  Do not do too much, but when you have enough of them, then even getting a penny from everyone, you will receive a ruble.  In this regard, <a href="http://davydov.blogspot.com/">Davydov</a> cleverly enters.  He simply creates a new site every month.  What else is good this method that you do not depend on search engines.  Having banned one domain, you will continue to earn income from others and this will not hit your wallet a lot. <br></li><li>  <strong>Join social networks.</strong> <strong><br></strong>  Infusion in social networks will give an excellent influx of visitors to the site.  The main thing is not to rush to the network like <a href="http://www.myspace.com/">MySpace</a> or <a href="http://www.digg.com/">Digg!</a>  .  The thing is that there is difficult to promote the site.  Even if you write good content, the ‚Äúkings‚Äù of these sites will quickly drop you.  And all articles like ‚Äú <a href="http://www.google.com/search%3Fhl%3Dru%26amp%3Bclient%3Dopera%26amp%3Brls%3Dru%26amp%3Bhs%3DZyD%26amp%3Bq%3D%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BA%2B%25D0%25BF%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BD%25D1%2583%25D1%2582%25D1%258C%2B%25D1%2581%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B9%25D1%2582%2B%25D0%25B2%2B%25D1%2582%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BF%2Bdigg%26amp%3BbtnG%3D%25D0%259F%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B8%25D1%2581%25D0%25BA%26amp%3Blr%3D">how to promote a site in the top digg</a> ‚Äù will not help.  Try to spin in thematic social networks.  In Russian, <a href="http://www.e-xecutive.ru/">E-Xecutive</a> and <a href="http://www.moikrug.ru/">My Circle are</a> perfect for businessmen and managers. <br></li><li>  <strong>Make a social network.</strong> <strong><br></strong>  Search engines - evil.  In any case, for webmasters.  Constant dependence on the mood of their Majesty strains very many.  Therefore, try to keep away from them, in terms of attracting traffic.  Look for as many ways to drive traffic to the site aside from search engines.  Make a social network when people themselves are interested in filling and promoting the site.  For example, <a href="http://www.wikipedia.org/">Wikipedia</a> receives more than 50% of traffic thanks to the social component of the site and viral marketing. </li></ol>  <a href="http://z.codeby.net/">A source</a> </div>
