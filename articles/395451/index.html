Traction to constant control over what is happening, total distrust of machines and algorithms - is gradually dying off. <br><br>  Children and young people, already brought up on cartoons with talking cars and airplanes, are subconsciously ready to recognize in a car not only the intellect superior to the human, but the real mind and even the soul (endowed with goodwill - these are cartoons).  And recognizing this subconsciously, feel the willingness to delegate to the smart machine everything that takes time or causes difficulties for themselves. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/8dd/551/2aa/8dd5512aa6ca4e489a9b44272cd3ed8d.png" alt="image"><a name="habracut"></a>

    <h5>  Flour choice </h5><br>  Few things in the world also impede and expend moral strengths, like the agony of constant choice.  Choices including within the interface when interacting with any information system.  The choice of goods or services, further actions or photo captions - this all takes away our time and effort every day.  The generation of those born in the last century cannot yet completely entrust the selection of the optimal purchase with fully and completely existing intellectual systems, thereby constantly fanning the bubble of the marketing and marketing business to unimaginable values.  But people of the new millennium are already able to calmly delegate the entire routine of busting possible options to a machine algorithm without any moral torment. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/a48/f78/b13/a48f78b13d432c44cbb5104d4160652a.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The first to guess about the revolutionary changes in the psychology of generations was YouTube, making the launch of the next video automatic, without asking the user once more, without even getting him an extra choice.  Perhaps you personally still do not like it?  And your children are already satisfied - the cartoons are going on as usual, they are launched by themselves, only the advertisements of the father‚Äôs ‚Äútanchiki‚Äù constantly interfere. <br><br>  Are you still choosing a gift for your wife on March 8, shoveling hundreds of sites and spending a dozen hours?  And your daughter has already heard about startups of the XXI century, where fashion accessories are brought in by subscription, for a while, with the opportunity to try out personally and keep everything you like after the test drive.  This is not a choice as such, because a complex algorithm has chosen a whole image for the buyer.  For the end user, such an endless supply of ideally selected goods by the store is just an opportunity to get more fashionable look or funny jokes for the same money. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/281/9d5/793/2819d57932858daa24c9c5b249d76122.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Today's wild HYIP around the Nimb security rings is also based on the latest psychological approach to interfaces - the victim doesn‚Äôt choose who exactly she wants to send the message to, what kind of emoji you don‚Äôt have.  The smart system does it all at once.  Not far off, a ring to order your favorite pizza in 1 click for those who love ‚Äúas usual‚Äù.  One of my friends even argues that the analogue of the marriage ring for men with the secret call of a prostitute / mistress by simply pressing the secret ring once - will blow up the market, as no other NIMB has ever dreamed of. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/d6b/7a0/ec6/d6b7a0ec64854d9815a7d03413680e57.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Jokes, but the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãa button without an interface increasingly excites the minds of the most advanced UX researchers themselves, who are measuring the evolution of user experience and looking for new ways to satisfy it. <br><br>  Here are just a few of the potential uses for new-type interfaces with an almost inactive user: <br><br>  <i>Car with autopilot, auto delivery to the house of the new iphone model immediately after the presentation, phone with auto photographing (and automatic tags) - self-taking photos on Instagram every 5 minutes, thereby creating the chronology of each day, which you can look through with interest once again all events and persons encountered during a difficult day.</i> <br><br><h5>  Correctly sell a ticket </h5><br>  In order to illustrate once again clearly what business is waiting for today from modern interfaces and algorithms, I‚Äôll tell you about the saying of one of my acquaintances: ‚ÄúSpeaking about anything, always sell a ticket there‚Äù. <br><br>  Suppose a person is only briefly interested in announcing an upcoming organ concert or out of boredom read an article about Ancient Greece - and now, a modern business wants the user to drop a ready-made ticket to Athens or to the philharmonic on the mail or messenger right now the desired date.  Not complimentary.  not marketing spam with ‚Äúhooks‚Äù - but a finished ticket, which is left only to be redeemed at any time, after which the place will be booked. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/32e/9d9/ea5/32e9d9ea566ce3fac23d9b74189038cb.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The person listened to the song in the player - and immediately received a pdf-ku with the opportunity to attend a live concert of this group of such and such date.  Liknul photos of a friend from Spain - and in the evening the courier brought a passport with an open visa - it doesn‚Äôt sound fantastic, but interactions are expected at this level from the designers ‚Äúhere and now‚Äù. <br><br>  Business and technology are already ready for this, only the design of our outdated interfaces lags behind. <br><br><h5>  Conclusion </h5><br>  Creating a modern interface, get rid of the traction of giving control levers of each step to a user tortured by buttons and checkboxes.  Minimize any interactions: confirmations, choices and all sorts of settings, just give the person a full-fledged virtual manager of all his projects and everyday affairs, which many are psychologically ready to rely on. <br><br>  For the first time in the history of mankind, artificial algorithms are ready to fully replace most of the most complex operations that people have previously spent their entire lives on. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/395451/">https://habr.com/ru/post/395451/</a></p>
