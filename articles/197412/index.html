  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Samsung galaxy note 10.1 n8020 and yota</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><h4>  Connecting Samsung galaxy note 10.1 n8020 to yota. </h4><br><br>  Hello, friends. <br><br>  I would like to highlight here one small question that was not covered elsewhere at the time of this writing.  So, a new version of the excellent tablet from Samsung appeared on sale, and it differs in LTE support.  Moreover, the support of 800/900/1800/2600 MHz frequencies is claimed, which allows us to hope to use this device in Russian networks (2600 MHz is declared by all major LTE operators in Russia).  Personally, I made my choice in favor of yota.  But the task was not quite trivial.  However, in the end it was successfully implemented.  Moreover, it seems that similar problems are waiting for users of other operators, such as MegaFon, so the article may be useful to them. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  So, the first thing that I was convinced of was getting the devotee and yota SIM card in my hands - the Internet access via LTE does not work.  I would like to clarify for those who are not familiar with the yota policy.  It is assumed that by inserting a sim-card, a person immediately gets free access to the Internet at minimum speed without any additional gestures.  All further settings are made using this access and they should not cause difficulties (and did not cause).  The problem arose exactly at the stage of connecting to the yota network. 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>
        <script>
          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      The Internet does not earn, what to do?  A quick analysis of the settings showed that the tablet actually sees the 3g networks of the big three, but 4g does not.  In the settings, a mode was chosen that implies a network type auto-selection between 2g, 3g and lte (the other two options exclude LTE, and the option ‚Äúonly LTE‚Äù is not listed).  Having made the assumption that the problem with the coating or simka, I visited the nearest salon yota.  Simka was replaced, the yota-whistle successfully working in this place was demonstrated, but the tablet didn‚Äôt get any easier, the picture has not changed.  I have already checked the hypothesis about any regional restrictions earlier, with the 3g sim card, the Internet on the tablet works wonderfully without shaking a tambourine. <br><br>  Thus, I moved to the next hypothesis - the problem is either with the firmware or with the settings.  The firmware was the latest version, in the custom firmware there was no mention of any lte fixes.  The tablet itself is new, there are very few articles about it.  In the reviews, the truth was that someone mentioned that his yota had somehow started up, but how it was not specified.  And it helped the article about setting up other samsung lte-devices. <br><br>  The solution was as follows.  The ShowServiceMode For Galaxy LTE program has been downloaded and installed.  She allowed to switch the LTE frequency to LTE ALL mode, after which the 3g and 2g networks were no longer detected, but the tablet immediately saw 4g ‚Äî yota networks (by the way, it can be indicated not as yota in the list, but as a 5-digit number, but it‚Äôs nevertheless Yota and the tablet connects to it) and Megaphone.  Next, an access point with an arbitrary name is created, in the ‚Äúaccess point‚Äù field it should be yota.ru.  And it was a victory.  Then everything is like a clock.  The only time is that when changing or removing the sim, the settings are reset, and after loading, you need to specify LTE ALL again.  Therefore, you should not delete the irreplaceable program.  But turning off and restarting the device does not reset the settings, so if you do not plan to change the operator, you can not worry about anything. <br><br>  PS A similar instruction, as it turned out, can be found for Galaxy note 2 LTE.  But if I could not so easily find a solution to the problem, probably my article will be useful to others. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/197412/">https://habr.com/ru/post/197412/</a></p>
