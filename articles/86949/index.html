And if someone does not think of life without the TI-85 emulator, then here I am not an assistant - you yourself.  :) <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/459/8eb/9e5/4598eb9e509e408a71000a451dbaec7c.gif" alt="image"><br><hr><br><h4>  Dendy (NES) </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/b72/b70/bc5/b72b70bc5fac8ae8b09058c3597b7150.jpg"><br>  As usual, let's start with Dendy.  Regarding live emulators, two pieces are NES DS (PocketNES port on NDS) and NesterDS (Nester port).  NES DS is considered ‚Äúcorrect‚Äù because I started with it.  I finished them, because, judging by the description, NesterDS does not provide any additional features. <br><br>  There are no difficulties in using: <br>  1. Download ( <a href="http://www.zophar.net/consoles/nds/nes/nesds.html">from here</a> , because the author‚Äôs site is dead) <br>  2. Write emulator and games on a flash drive (games, for example, can be downloaded from here - <a href="http://emudendy.ru/">emudendy.ru</a> ). <br>  3. Enable the console, run the emulator, select the game. <br>  4. Play

The only thing is that the screen is slightly cropped at the top and bottom (the resolution is dendy 256x224, against 256x192 for NDS), but in most games this does not interfere. <br>  <a href="http://gbatemp.net/index.php%3Fshowtopic%3D81903">Here</a> you can see the list of compatibility.  703 games checked.  A <a href="http://rutracker.org/forum/viewtopic.php%3Ft%3D862550">full set of</a> titles for NES includes 16384 positions. <br><hr><br><h4>  Super Nintendo (SNES) </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/53e/ea7/6fe/53eea76fe248e21c795fb7df9c55870f.jpg"><br>  After NES, I got Super Nintendo - an acquaintance worked in a store selling cartridges, so you could take any games for hire (for free, by itself :)).  Therefore, I looked down on the owners of the shogi and called them rogue.  It seems that it struck me back.  :( <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/85e/027/7d1/85e0277d13af793c7490352babb03fa2.jpg"><br><br>  For even <a href="http://www.snemul.com/ds/">SnemulDS</a> , the only more or less working SNES emulator, ensures only Earthworm Jim (first part) to work normally.  Everything else that I tried (Donkey Kong, Lost Vikings 2, Aladdin, Batman, Super Mario World, Rock'N'Roll Racing) either does not start, or works with some tricks, such as screen flicker.  Perhaps, having rummaged in the settings and having played around with layers, etc., I will make the games work normally (Donkey Kong'a has almost finished), but spending time setting up the game instead of the game itself is somehow not serious. <br><br>  Therefore, I have to admit that SNES emulation on NDS is not very successful, purely for a tick.  But it makes sense to try, suddenly you will be more lucky than me.  So SNES had to be postponed and comforted by the next item on our program.  :) <br><hr><br><h4>  Sega Mega Drive (Genesis) </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/95e/d89/a55/95ed89a556fa5bff18eca5ff7c62cde4.jpg"><br>  Sega once passed by me - see above.  I looked down on the owners of the shogi, and it looks like she struck back.  Because how bad SNES emulation is, how good is Sega emulation.  With SNES'ovskimi exclusives, I flew, but the multiplatform on the sego is not that globally worse than Nintendo. <br><br>  The emulator is called jenesisDS.  In terms of installing and using anything unusual: <br>  1. Download ( <a href="http://www.zophar.net/consoles/nds/genesis/jenesisds.html">from here</a> , because I did not understand the author‚Äôs site where the ‚ÄúDownload‚Äù button is :)) <br>  2. Write emulator and games on a flash drive (games, for example, can be downloaded from here - <a href="http://emusega.ru/">emusega.ru</a> ). <br>  3. Enable the console, run the emulator, select the game. <br>  4. Play <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/86b/8aa/0e4/86b8aa0e429fa4c577c65675c7767505.jpg"><br><br>  The personal ‚Äúgolden fund‚Äù was launched without questions - Lost Vikings, Rock'n'Roll Racing, Desert / Urban / Jungle Strike, Earthworm Jim, both parts, Ecco, Aladdin, Flash Back. <br>  The screen resolution of the shogi was slightly larger than that of the NDS, because the visible part of the screen scrolled slightly during the game, depending on which direction arrow was pressed.  It is necessary to get used to, but play practically does not interfere. <br><hr><br><h4>  NEO-GEO </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/592/4a1/4d0/5924a14d02df3df41b0ce9d8400ac762.jpg" alt="image"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/13b/4a5/9f5/13b4a59f59433085d8ba3b78c916d81c.jpg" alt="image"><br>  NEOGEO is familiar to most people not by the home version, but by the big slot machines that were popular in Russia.  For me personally, NEOGEO is a series of King of Fighters fighting games and a funny Metal Slug arcade game (the seventh part of which, by the way, is in the native version for NDS).  Although the games have been played for a long time (on a computer, Winkawaks emulator), I still come back to them from time to time. <br> <a href="http://fastpic.ru/view/2/2010/0310/3e201b84a37b08e4aefe90d50bdc4bd6.jpg.html"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/439/f0a/51e/439f0a51e3ca3b44d8b523f8ae8c60ed.jpg"></a> <a href="http://fastpic.ru/view/2/2010/0310/87122084bb9513c7780c6c74e9aacea4.jpg.html"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/119/62f/bcc/11962fbccbf15974736a0c65806523fb.jpg"></a> <a href="http://fastpic.ru/view/2/2010/0310/8e516c17f9c8b8b94b865d8cfeeca172.gif.html"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/5e6/e7a/7dc/5e6e7a7dc97734fbd613737a81d21e57.jpg"></a> <a href="http://fastpic.ru/view/2/2010/0310/84fabbe8297077d946277f5cc73f638a.jpg.html"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/436/196/d6a/436196d6a8fe1f6d19ed4031d462dae5.jpg"></a> <br><br>  The emulator (NeoDS), in principle, works without problems, although it sometimes slows down - there is not enough RAM. <br>  Memory upgrade (purchase of EZ-Flash 3in1) is planned (paid, waiting for delivery). <br><br>  Installing and using an emulator is somewhat more complicated than the previous ones. <br>  1) First, the <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/neods">emulator is</a> downloaded and the <a href="http://narod.ru/disk/18628823000/neogeo.zip.html">bios for the emulator</a> . <br>  2) The emulator itself (NeoDs.nds) is copied to the flash drive. <br>  3) Next, the most interesting part begins - the process of converting rums: <br>  3.1) In the archive with the emulator lies the NeoDsConvert.exe program, it must be copied into a separate folder. <br>  3.2) In the same folder, put the bios for the emulator and the archives with games (it so happened that the Roma for neogeo always live in zip-archives, even when using their emulators). <br>  3.3) After that, run NeoDsConvert with the -bios8 key (‚ÄúNeoDsConvert.exe -bios8‚Äù) - games that were successfully converted will get the neo extension (that is, if you were in the kof98.zip folder, then kof98 will appear next to it. neo). <br>  4) The resulting files must be copied to the <b>root</b> directory of the memory card.  neogeo.neo can not be copied - it is needed only at the stage of conversion. <br>  5) On the console itself, everything is as usual - launch neods.nds, choose a game and play.  When asked to throw a coin - press Select.  :) The size of the picture again does not fit the screen size, you can enter or play as it is, if the edges of the screen are not particularly important. <br><br>  Unfortunately, not all games are converted, but only those that are stored in * .bin.  If in the archive with the game are * .rom or some other extension, the conversion will not occur.  But KoF'y and Slug'i converted successfully. <br>  About 160 games were successfully converted from <a href="http://rutracker.org/forum/viewtopic.php%3Ft%3D582586">this archive</a> (and <a href="http://gbatemp.net/index.php%3Fshowtopic%3D102177">here</a> you can look at <a href="http://gbatemp.net/index.php%3Fshowtopic%3D102177">the compatibility list</a> ). <br><hr><br><h4>  GameBoy Color (GB, GBC) </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/d36/949/dd2/d36949dd24817e88d1c7425988c246ad.jpg"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/52e/143/65c/52e14365ce2ce5afa69c1af65f1683dd.jpg"><br>  Games for Gameboy and Gameboy Color are engaged in one emulator - lameboy. <br>  Author page: <a href="http://lameboy.nutki.com/">lameboy.nutki.com</a> <br>  It is set as standard - download, run on a flash drive. <br>  Games to take on <a href="http://emugbc.ru/">emugbc.ru</a> and <a href="http://emugb.ru/">emugb.ru</a> .  Or just download the <a href="http://rutracker.org/forum/viewtopic.php%3Ft%3D1995251">full romset</a> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/39c/986/13e/39c98613e6b48d23c1afbf5c374629b6.jpg"><br><br>  I did not have a gameboy, so nostalgia does not torment me.  And the graphics have somehow not to get acquainted.  Just put to check the performance.  Works.  You can save.  GB games are gray (although you can make them green), GBC games are multicolored.  The image is either small (160x144) or stretched proportionally to the size of the screen.  Look like that's it. <br><hr><br><h4>  GameBoy Advance (GBA) </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/9c5/9bd/18c/9c59bd18cc948a2d8e594a3ca50d91b7.jpg"><br>  GameBoy Advance doesn‚Äôt have to be emulated, NDS and NDS Lite have a connector for its cartridges. <br>  But people, as usual, feel sorry for the money, but I want to play.  Therefore, Roma download for the Internet ( <a href="http://emugba.ru/">emugba.ru</a> ), and in order to launch it, they invented a piece called EZ-Flash 3-in-1: <br><img src="http://wiki.gbatemp.net/wiki/images/thumb/0/0f/EZ-Flash_3in1_gba_sized.jpg/350px-EZ-Flash_3in1_gba_sized.jpg" alt="image"><br>  Without any help, NDS itself cannot launch GBA ROMs, since the game cartridge is not only a <s>valuable</s> ROM ROM, but also a certain amount of RAM. <br>  EZ-Flash 3in1 is a memory for running games, additional RAM for heavy applications and a vibrator. <br><br>  I don‚Äôt have it (I‚Äôm waiting), so I‚Äôm not writing anything about GBA emulation anymore  Until. <br><hr><br><h4>  ScummVM </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/5c6/5cb/b0f/5c65cbb0f797d15b72b38ed185e20eaa.png"><br>  SCUMM is Script Creation Utility for Maniac Mansion, the ‚Äúlanguage‚Äù for developing quests.  And ScummVM is a set of emulators for running these quests (and several others). <br><br>  Website: <a href="http://scummvm.drunkencoders.com/">scummvm.drunkencoders.com</a> <br>  The easiest installation method is to download <a href="http://rutracker.org/forum/viewtopic.php%3Ft%3D2147863">this kit</a> and do what it says (there is an emulator and several dozen games). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/6d2/34d/b48/6d234db483158b4cba8d1740d260429a.jpg" alt="image"><br> <a href="http://fastpic.ru/view/3/2009/1023/29b626f324d83d9345d1dd770873be2a.png.html"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/e27/c84/c9b/e27c84c9bbb07e5563e8d06e8ebfd678.jpg"></a> <a href="http://fastpic.ru/view/3/2009/1023/ae3869a7c3ec280f6b39d66da3dce71f.jpg.html"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/a8d/038/ea0/a8d038ea0f4996c7a2ecffbcf4eff611.jpg"></a> <a href="http://fastpic.ru/view/3/2009/1023/8b2ac30e840f51ff17cb589d9224d658.gif.html"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/50a/89d/515/50a89d515858e9ad3acf4a9b1517e151.jpg"></a> <a href="http://fastpic.ru/view/3/2009/1023/258ebcab6a3749f73bbaa5bd57f633f5.jpg.html"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/705/205/491/7052054915bd0c28f5a3b6b5d4d58f31.jpg"></a> <br> <a href="http://fastpic.ru/view/3/2009/1023/5fabbfeed5c0724681821fef12a9ec1e.jpg.html"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/bfe/8c9/253/bfe8c9253391d3b68670ae79e549d0c3.jpg"></a> <a href="http://fastpic.ru/view/3/2009/1023/45a726c5f3cb61ba9c46478d8036c3e8.png.html"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/7df/675/02c/7df67502ce074165f2ea77afadc64e42.jpg"></a> <a href="http://fastpic.ru/view/3/2009/1023/721df1cb974cdf6f0b9a267d565d408a.gif.html"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/b25/9e3/89d/b259e389d392c03192131fafcfd03e7e.jpg"></a> <br><br>  Once again, it was Day of The Tentacle and Loom, recalled an old cyberpunk named Beneath a Steel Sky, once again missed the Flight of the Amazon Queen:) ... And regretted that there was not enough memory to launch The Dig and Full Throtle (although about The Dig write that it does not pass - flies to some location). <br><hr><br><h4>  MSX </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/comment_images/545/8fa/459/5458fa4593700c81b8b9aa595f1712ff.jpg"><br>  MSX is my first computer.  I became acquainted with him around 1986, and although access to IBM-compatible appeared in 1988, the communication with the Yamaha MSX was very frequent until the year 1993. <br>  There is no particular nostalgia for toys, except for one of them - New Adam &amp; Eve.  She only went on MSX2, and this was a teacher's car.  Therefore, it was rarely possible to reach it, so the game was not fully completed. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/d2d/c40/679/d2dc406791933f361de839fa1db51e02.gif"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/cfe/356/2b5/cfe3562b5a4c3c5f25633892b6a716b1.gif"><br><br>  Through long wanderings on the Internet (the name he remembered the longest, it took several days), he still found rum with the game. <br><br>  The emulator MSX for NDS is like one, but in four versions.  I settled on <a href="http://www.alternate-fmsxds.webs.com/index.html">msxDS</a> , as if it were really alive - it was updated on March 3. <br><br>  First, the emulator itself is downloaded and dropped on a flash drive.  The msxds / folder from the archive is placed in the root directory. <br>  From here - <a href="http://fms.komkon.org/fMSX/">fms.komkon.org/fMSX</a> - ‚ÄúRequired ROM Images‚Äù are downloaded and put in the msxds / - MSX.ROM, MSX2.ROM, MSX2EXT.ROM, MSX2P.ROM, MSX2PEXT.ROM, DISK.ROM catalog. <br><br>  After that, you start the emulator, in the menu, press the ROM1 button, point it to the desired rum, then press the virtual power button. <br>  If the file with the game / program with the extension * .dsk, in not * .rom, then it should be thrust into the drive. <br><br>  You can play. <br><br>  And don't forget that MSX is still a type of computer, not a game console.  And a <a href="http://rutracker.org/forum/viewtopic.php%3Ft%3D2615485">full romset</a> occupies 32 gigabytes (although there everything must be repeated ten times ...) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/543/ca8/32b/543ca832b95a646fcb67566b588e5146.jpg"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/5a0/772/56e/5a077256ed7851e299278ba36727d45e.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/fb1/16a/e61/fb116ae618d7104b865a4eba01b250d1.jpg"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/b93/405/b3d/b93405b3df26163f1f98ed13ec2c9df1.jpg"><br><hr><br><h4>  ZX Spectrum </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/12d/a1c/1b1/12da1c1b194289674d48706880808c9d.jpg"><br>  But the Spectrum also passed by me - I had access to MSX and IBM, so I didn‚Äôt even look at some TV set-top box (although I went to play the first computer clubs that appeared in the late eighties). <br><br>  And despite the fact that 256x192 seems to hint :), I decided not to bother with Spectrum emulation.  But considering that his fans still meet (a friend recently boasted that he had finished his memory with up to 2 megs, attached an IDE controller and RJ45), I will give a few links to the topic. <br><br>  Short instructions: <a href="http://ndslite.ru/wp/2009/04/12/emulyator-zx-spektrum-dlya-ds-lite/">ndslite.ru/wp/2009/04/12/emulyator-zx-spektrum-dlya-ds-lite</a> <br>  Emulator homepage: <a href="http://zxds.raxoft.cz/">zxds.raxoft.cz</a> <br>  Spectrum portal: <a href="http://www.worldofspectrum.org/">www.worldofspectrum.org</a> <br><hr><br><h4>  Epilogue </h4><br>  So although NDS does not have the power of PSP or specially trained multiplatform emulators, it's not that bad.  And nostalgic geeks may well launch their favorite toys of their childhood.  :) <br><br>  The plans - see what can offer in terms of ipod touch emulation.  I saw the NES and SNES emulators for it (though I didn‚Äôt set it), plus they write about the PSX emulator - I want to look.  There is exactly ScummVM (it is for everything), it seems like there are sega and different gameboys ... In general, you have to look. <br><hr><br>  Related Links: <br>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/gadgets/78915/">habrahabr.ru/blogs/gadgets/78915</a> - my "review" of NDS <br>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/gadgets/82223/">habrahabr.ru/blogs/gadgets/82223</a> - Review of the portable GP2X Wiz emulator <br>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/gadgets/57113/">habrahabr.ru/blogs/gadgets/57113</a> - Review of the portable emulator Dingoo Digital A-320 <br>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/psp/73930/">habrahabr.ru/blogs/psp/73930</a> - PSP as an emulator <br>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/games/12943/">habrahabr.ru/blogs/games/12943</a> - NES on iphone <br>  <a href="http://gbx.ru/index.php%3Fshowtopic%3D55331">gbx.ru/index.php?showtopic=55331</a> - Odroid - gaming console / PDA based on android </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/86949/">https://habr.com/ru/post/86949/</a></p>
