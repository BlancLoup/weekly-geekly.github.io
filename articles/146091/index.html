  <section class="page js-page"><h1>You can control the quality of services automatically: KwikPik Experience</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Once, my article <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/74524/">‚ÄúWhy do we have 90% of clients with us?‚Äù</a> , Devoted to one of my first taxis, literally blew up Habr overnight, and brought me to the top of the list of habra people.  Two and a half years have passed, and I am again connected with a taxi.  The main component of the success of the first article was the emphasis on the quality of services I wrote about.  For taxis, it was and remains a big problem - it is not even in the staff, but in control over it.  Large park, a large number of staff - difficult to control.  The quality began to sink when the number of drivers exceeded 25 people (¬±) - the opportunity to control everyone was gone, to call everyone, to help everyone.  Employees, in general, became a gray mass and fuel for business, I stopped knowing them by sight.  At the same time, the drivers "lost" me.  Trying to serve customers at a high level and observing my generally simple rules, they knew that they were personally responding to me.  Of course, I was not every friend, but I gave them work, and they responded with diligence.  As soon as the mature company began to give work, I ceased to be a guarantor for them, they ceased to be ‚Äúobliged‚Äù to me personally.  If they tried for me, they didn‚Äôt want to try for the sake of an abstract company. <br><br>  Anyway, the issue of controlling the quality of work of taxi drivers has been busy for me all these years.  How does most competitors control quality?  There are only two ways - test purchases (secret passengers) and work with customer reviews.  I take a lot of taxis, I constantly try to drive cars of various services - I see what interesting things they come up with.  If I don‚Äôt like something, I‚Äôm always looking for an opportunity to complain - I make a phone call located in the car‚Äôs cabin, I write complaints to the emails indicated on the website, in VKontakte groups.  Well, or just dial the control room number again.  As a rule, nothing changes afterwards, but ‚Äúwe will definitely figure it out‚Äù remains the duty response to get rid of. <br><br>  How to be? <br>  It looks like a solution has been found! <a name="habracut"></a>

      Now we are doing with colleagues an absolutely amazing (in my opinion) thing - Kwikpik.me.  QuickPick is an innovative service that should help taxi drivers and passengers effectively find each other, negotiate the price of a trip, and so on.  The project is well-known, <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/140233/">the Start Fellows grant winner Milner-Durov,</a> and so on.  I will not stop in detail.  If someone is interested - you can find out the details on the <a href="http://www.kwikpik.me/">site</a> .  And ride KvikPike - also possible.  And you even need :) <br><br>  The point is that, in essence, QuickPick is a social network of passengers and drivers.  Private drivers are the very people with whom it is difficult to control quality.  This is their car, and the car - like shoes.  People follow them or not.  Once it is cleaned to show you, everyone can, but not everyone can take care of it.  Now there are almost a thousand drivers registered in the system - not only in St. Petersburg, but also in Moscow, Odessa, Kiev, Baku.  How to follow them?  They do not know who Mikhail Vinogradov is, for the sake of whom everyone needs to try to be polite, careful, and so on. <br><br>  The exit was a rating system.  After the end of the trip, the system offers the driver and passenger to evaluate each other according to a number of parameters.  The systems of parameters for one and the other are different, and we intend to develop them in every way so that the rating does not dry out, but to be a real indicator of coolness, first of all, of the driver, and secondly, of the passenger. <br><br>  The system of ratings of passengers by drivers is generally a thing that only we do.  While it is embryonic, but it is also waiting for development.  Drivers - it is also important to understand who they have to drive.  Taking the order, the driver sees what the potential passenger ‚Äúdistinguished‚Äù on past trips: <br><br><img src="http://mikevinogradov.ru/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/%D0%A1%D0%BD%D0%B8%D0%BC%D0%BE%D0%BA-%D1%8D%D0%BA%D1%80%D0%B0%D0%BD%D0%B0-19.06.2012-14.16.06-%D1%81-%D0%A1%D0%B8%D0%BC%D1%83%D0%BB%D1%8F%D1%82%D0%BE%D1%80%D0%B0-iOS.png" alt="image"><br><br>  The screenshot shows that the passenger spoiled the interior once and canceled the order 28 times.  I'm afraid he won't wait for a good driver :).  Practically, such a rating is equivalent to getting into the "black list" - such are in most taxis.  And if earlier ‚Äúbanished‚Äù at the discretion of the dispatcher, now the punishment comes according to objective indicators.  No blacklists are needed.  One continuous self-regulation. <br><br>  After the end of the trip, the driver can ‚Äúbrand‚Äù the passenger. <br><br><img src="http://mikevinogradov.ru/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/%D0%A1%D0%BD%D0%B8%D0%BC%D0%BE%D0%BA-%D1%8D%D0%BA%D1%80%D0%B0%D0%BD%D0%B0-19.06.2012-14.17.10-%D1%81-%D0%A1%D0%B8%D0%BC%D1%83%D0%BB%D1%8F%D1%82%D0%BE%D1%80%D0%B0-iOS.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Again, I want to develop a rating system.  In particular, of course, you need to enter and positive - left a decent tip, came out on time, did not distract from the road, a pleasant companion.  This system of recommendations.  Through it, our taxi should grow into a really high-quality service. <br><br>  The passenger also sees what kind of person goes to him.  In the list of incoming offers, drivers can see the star rating: <br><br><img src="http://mikevinogradov.ru/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/%D0%A1%D0%BD%D0%B8%D0%BC%D0%BE%D0%BA-%D1%8D%D0%BA%D1%80%D0%B0%D0%BD%D0%B0-19.06.2012-14.22.53-%D1%81-%D0%A1%D0%B8%D0%BC%D1%83%D0%BB%D1%8F%D1%82%D0%BE%D1%80%D0%B0-iOS.png" alt="image"><br><br>  You can find out more about the driver, as well as see the latest reviews about his work: <br><br><img src="http://mikevinogradov.ru/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/%D0%A1%D0%BD%D0%B8%D0%BC%D0%BE%D0%BA-%D1%8D%D0%BA%D1%80%D0%B0%D0%BD%D0%B0-19.06.2012-14.22.57-%D1%81-%D0%A1%D0%B8%D0%BC%D1%83%D0%BB%D1%8F%D1%82%D0%BE%D1%80%D0%B0-iOS.png" alt="image"><br><br>  The driver card is visible when the order has already been made, and the passenger is waiting for the car.  The map shows where the car is located.  A card with the number, brand and model of the car, as well as the driver‚Äôs name and photo make it easy to find the taxi that arrived, and the convenient ‚Äúcall the driver‚Äù button allows you to contact him directly from the interface - no control rooms, SMS messages, redirects and other difficulties: <br><br><img src="http://mikevinogradov.ru/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/%D0%A1%D0%BD%D0%B8%D0%BC%D0%BE%D0%BA-%D1%8D%D0%BA%D1%80%D0%B0%D0%BD%D0%B0-19.06.2012-14.23.13-%D1%81-%D0%A1%D0%B8%D0%BC%D1%83%D0%BB%D1%8F%D1%82%D0%BE%D1%80%D0%B0-iOS.png" alt="image"><br><br>  After the end of the trip, the passenger assesses the driver according to several parameters and can leave a review.  Let me remind you, the assessment will affect the reputation of the driver and the commission that he pays the system.  A bad driver will thus be punished with a ruble, and a good driver will be awarded: <br><br><img src="http://mikevinogradov.ru/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/%D0%A1%D0%BD%D0%B8%D0%BC%D0%BE%D0%BA-%D1%8D%D0%BA%D1%80%D0%B0%D0%BD%D0%B0-19.06.2012-14.23.46-%D1%81-%D0%A1%D0%B8%D0%BC%D1%83%D0%BB%D1%8F%D1%82%D0%BE%D1%80%D0%B0-iOS.png" alt="image"><br><br>  One of our competitors also considers the rating of drivers, and the worst one is dismissed monthly.  We have not yet reached such extremes.  Yes, and there is no special meaning in this.  A bad driver will not get a job and will stop working by himself. <br><br>  I, as a marketer, and as a person who has worked a lot in various taxis, it is clear that the more clearly people can choose a driver / passenger, the more they will be satisfied with their trips, and the KwikPik brand will be more loyal. <br><br>  It is a joy to understand that good people work for you.  The lowest estimate is 3.2 out of five, and there are only a few such drivers.  The absolute majority - four or more.  A lot of round honors.  Which is typical, and the work they do more.  It seems to me that this is due not only to the fact that they are more often chosen by passengers, but also to the internal motivation of the drivers themselves.  It's nice to work when you do well and you have a clear proof of this.  I once called drivers and praised them for their excellent work - for example, when I showed off on pleasant trips to passengers.  I was afraid that it was impossible to program this work.  Can.  Although many drivers I still praise myself too.  Even though the human factor can already be ruled out, it seems to me that for the time being this is not necessary. <br><br>  If you observe the process of winning stars in the dynamics, it is also seen that drivers who have an approaching excellent rating try harder - they want to achieve an ideal reputation.  Moreover, the ‚Äúhonors pupils‚Äù are adequately rewarded - they pay our service the smallest commission in the city, and maybe in the country - only 7%.  The average commission dispatch taxi in St. Petersburg - more than 20%.  Our commission is floating (from 7 to 20%), and depends on the driver's rating. <br><br>  - <br><br>  This is what I am for.  This is all to the fact that time has changed a lot, and technology too.  The quality of services can especially not be controlled.  The main thing is to give people the opportunity to buy what suits them, to choose more or less objectively.  Quality control is a system for collecting objective data.  You can build this in any business services.  And in business, as you know, if something can be done - you need to do it.  Good luck to all. <br><br>  In the comments, I wait for criticism, advice, cheers of approval - in general, the usual habroreaction :) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/146091/">https://habr.com/ru/post/146091/</a></p>
