So far this is only a social movement, and not an officially registered party) is going to significantly change the scheme of the project, planning to publish independently found documents.  In general, the scheme is the same as that used in Wikileaks, only the materials will already be their own. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>  In principle, not many people have heard of the project Ruleaks.net, although in a couple of comments on Habr√© information about the site slipped.  So, the resource began work in December last year, posting translations of documents from Wikileaks.  Were selected the most relevant documents for the residents of the Russian Federation and the CIS, which were translated - after all, not everyone knows English, right?  In general, the initiative is quite interesting, and now the project is going to become a completely independent information source, independent of Wikileaks. <br><br>  According to the project team, an interesting collection of documents has already been collected, which will be published, possibly already this month.  Documents of the Russian-language project are collected on the same principle as in Wikileaks - any person who has interesting documentation and who wants to share it, can send this documentation to the Ruleaks administration.  Anonymity of the sender is provided through the TOR network.  In order to send a document, it is enough to download the client for the TOR network, there is a link to it on Ruleaks, and download the documents.

      It is clear that all the submitted documents will not be published - the expert group will select the most relevant, in the opinion of the experts themselves, documents, and publish them on the site.  The expert group will include journalists, academics, university professors. <br><br>  By the way, Ruleaks does not yet have a powerful financial support system, which provides (or rather, provided most of the financial accounts until the moment of blocking) Wikileaks.  The project team employs enthusiasts who do not receive remuneration for their work.  Hosting is paid with the support of the Pirate Party of Russia and other pirate parties from European countries. <br><br>  In general, it is quite difficult now to say whether the project will work as efficiently as Wikileaks does, and in general whether Ruleaks will become a popular project.  Currently, Ruleaks has a more well-known competitor, the <a href="http://rospil.info/">RosPil</a> resource, which is ‚Äúsharpened‚Äù under the disclosure of cases involving fake or real state projects, whose funds are not going where they should go. <br><br>  In general, I personally think that the appearance of such projects is a good sign.  What do you think - is a project like Ruleaks necessary, and if so, can it work efficiently enough? </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/288240/">https://habr.com/ru/post/288240/</a></p>
