  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How to get out of the apartment alive? The presence sensor - the device against the most common type of robbery</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  In criminal slang, this is called "enter on the shoulders."  The attackers are waiting for the owner to leave the house, or vice versa will come, and unlock the door.  In this short moment of opening - closing the door, which lasts for a dozen seconds, its own apartment turns into a mousetrap. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Anyone who lived in Europe or America knows that crime is not uncommon in wealthy countries.  But, unfortunately, Russia is distinguished by the fact that we are strongly dominated by crimes related to causing harm to the health of citizens.  Fences, grilles, electronic locks, ACS are and effectively work on a large number of houses in developed countries.  In our country, their presence has almost no effect on lowering the crime rate.  <b>In Russia, the doors are not opened as often as they are just waiting to be opened.</b> <b><br></b> <br>  We emphasize, today is the most common method of robbery.  For some reason, in the press and on television (especially in the ‚ÄúGood Morning‚Äù program), almost every day a completely different type of entry into the apartment is discussed: an attacker disguised as a plumber or social worker asks to open the door.  These cases, of course, also have a place to be, but not as often as the above described, so to speak, anonymous input. <br><br>  The fact is that before the opening of the stranger, the owner can warn someone, then describe the signs (if he remains alive), the neighbors will notice the long standing at the door.  Therefore, "role-playing" - the so-called undercover penetration in the criminal jargon - is not popular with experienced robbers.  It is much safer to track the time of departure - the arrival of the owner and in advance ‚Äúscrape‚Äù around the corner of the elevator or on the other floor to enter the stocking on the head, when the owner just opened the door.  As they say, urkogany, quickly and cleanly.  For those who do not understand, purely - it is in a mask, i.e.  without the possibility of identification.

      If we scare you a little with jargon, do not be afraid of us, we know him only in view of our professional activities: a large number of crimes are revealed through the <a href="http://ip-concierge.com/">Ipikonserzh</a> video surveillance systems.  Thousands of our cameras in the entrances and in front of houses allow us to analyze the behavior of intruders.  Very often, our experts give rise to interesting proposals that minimize criminal risks.  And we want to tell about one of them today - it is <a href="http://www.speclab.ru/dathik-prisutstviya">a presence sensor</a> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/7ef/bc0/871/7efbc0871b36479db610c00c720364e1.jpg"><br><br>  In fact, nothing complicated or expensive, just a few complemented logic of the usual IR motion sensor.  This addition is feasible for almost every person who is familiar with the soldering iron and mikruhi person.  It does not matter here which electronics or development tool to choose - only the algorithm is important.  From the experience of video surveillance and studying video recordings in multi-apartment entrances, our specialists clearly traced the behavior pattern characteristic of waiting for intruders: <br><br>  Naturally, no one will stand in front of the door-view, or in front of the camera, or even in front of the motion sensor, unless it‚Äôs crazy.  Always, always, whatever the entrance, on the staircase there is a place where you can hide before the arrival of the "client".  If this is a very poor panel five-story building, then you will just wait on the floor above. <br><br>  Simple - simple, but not quite simple.  Such places where you can wait simply, not moving, also not found.  Still, other people walk around the porches, alarming sounds are often heard, and a sedentary view behind a box from under the TV can be seen by a completely random witness.  Therefore, most often the attacker is in a kind of constant movement - such as going somewhere.  Let it be more imitation - in case someone passes by, unexpectedly gets out of the elevator or looks into the peephole - but definitely not complete rest.  Our practice clearly shows that the ‚Äúcaches‚Äù itself, sorry again for the jargon, takes place just a few minutes, or even seconds before the host approaches.  Prior to this, the villain goes back and forth from floor to floor past the desired apartment, constantly inspecting, listening, - vidocq, frankly, brought to life.  Unfortunately, we have no moral right to publish videos, even from public places, which are entrances.  The fact is that on the staircase of the alleged victim there is a periodical movement - passing, but movement. <br><br>  Naturally, any motion sensor simply winks imperceptibly and will not allow the owner to fix this fact.  Moreover, the flasher - the LED on the usual sensor is in the sensor itself - outside, and the owner does not see it.  But what can be done?  We attach another LED on the wire - and we start it inside the apartment.  Now this mini-lamp, talking about the passage of someone outside the door, is visible to the owner. <br><br>  But we have already said that in its usual logic it is inefficient, the owner can leave the house at that moment when no one is walking around the door.  Therefore, we add logic from ourselves: blink 10 minutes incrementally.  Motion detector triggered - start flashing for 10 minutes.  If during this period the triggering occurs again, reset the timer to zero and continue flashing for another 10 minutes.  Thus, while someone is waiting for you at the door, the indicator flashes all the time.  And here you have to decide whether to leave you at home or not. <br><br>  ‚ÄúThe one who is warned is armed‚Äù is the highest trump card in the game of survival.  You can prevent children from going out in all cases while the LED is flashing.  Or make you call you back.  You can also yourself, or wait until the presence indicator goes off, or warn someone that in 5 minutes without a call, you will need help.  You can use the alarm with the so-called deferred action and much more.  The very mood for difficult circumstances will give you the opportunity to hold out for at least 10 seconds - to rest against your body would not be thrown into the apartment.  And this is enough to break off the blitz scream that attackers are counting on.  The slightest delay in the plan - and the attackers will prefer to retire.  Tested on people! <br><br>  Of course, it‚Äôs not a fact that the one whom you are afraid of has walked behind the door, the neighbors also happen.  But look statistics in the eyes - how often do you meet them when leaving the apartment?  Did not count?  And we, yes.  In general, we have any statistics in this regard, we can even say how many times a day the front door opens, how many times the elevator is called, how many people like to go home on foot, and so on.  And we'll talk about it.  The average resident of a high-rise building only 1.15 times a week, leaving the apartment, meets neighbors.  And, in general, they are usually immediately visible in the peephole or in the camera, who has it.  Flashing LED - a reason to look through the peephole.  And the reason to prepare for the unexpected, if there is no one there. <br><br>  Of course, if you had a system of cameras and video analytics, you would immediately see who was tracking you, but it is difficult to assume that your hand will rise to take out fifty thousand rubles for this pleasure in enjoying security.  Normal video surveillance is useless, such a sum is for video analytics, without it, you still won't see anyone - no one will stand in front of the cameras.  And the IR motion sensor costs 200 rubles, there is even a rural store.  Another 10 rubles LED and 250 on the logic circuit.  Total: not more than 500 rubles.  If you have an electronic lock, the display can be hung on the button - before opening it is immediately clear that the button is flashing.  Yes, even if you order the development from your neighbor, the installer, it is quite affordable to spend "tyszschu" against the most unpleasant crime. <br><br>  And this kind of crime is really extremely unpleasant for the victim.  You are being pushed into an uncontrollable space, closed by nobody, where there are no witnesses.  And while you do not want to believe that you have neither values ‚Äã‚Äãnor jewels.  Even if you give everything, they will not believe for a long time.  We hope you understand what lies behind these words.  Here is one piece of advice: better not twitch, behave sincerely.  But only under the condition that the robbers in the mask.  If they went ‚Äúin a simple way‚Äù - a jargon that means that the faces of the criminals are open - make any efforts to break free or give a signal to the neighbors, in such cases, the happyness is not exactly planned. <br><br>  Yes, the article turned out not for the faint of heart, but when you look around the clock in thousands of cameras, you understand how cruel the world is.  If there is no place for such opuses, let us know - we will no longer shower you with negative statistics and intricacies about how not to get into it.  It was a little idea how to protect your exit from an apartment by 90%.  In the next article we wanted to talk about one more refinement for the same sensor, which will help in the case of an inconspicuous threat to dissuade you from opening the door at the ENTRANCE to the apartment.  Also nothing complicated, but how useful! <br><br>  <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/ip-concierge/blog/275624/">Continued ...</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/393911/">https://habr.com/ru/post/393911/</a></p>
