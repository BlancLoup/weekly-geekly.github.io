As a home use, there may be a viewing of the ceiling-mounted space for troubleshooting wiring or leak location, a clogged pipe, or a lost earring in a hard-to-reach place.  Whereas professionals can use for checking hidden work, diagnosing cars, etc. <br><br>  A flexible video camera comes in a proprietary retail package from Dadzhet with a description of places of use on the one hand and the appointment of basic elements on the other. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  On the side of the box located technical characteristics.  The package on the foam rubber substrate contains the device itself, which is completed with a USB-miniUSB cable, 3.5 Jack - RCA, replaced accessories and technical documentation.

      Technical documentation is made in the form of a color booklet.  I recommend to read the instructions, despite the fact that only a select few read the manuals and instructions :) <br><br>  Replaceable nozzles consist of: <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ Pretty long hook that can pick up or fix something. <br>  ‚Ä¢ Attachments with magnet for lifting magnetized parts <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/de4/6db/9cc/de46db9cc30a462cbff5a83076362c06.jpg"><br><br>  ‚Ä¢ Mirror, the most useless thing, because it is small and hard to see <br><br><br>  3.5 Jack cable - RCA is the most common, for displaying images on the TV screen.  In order for the above-mentioned accessories to hold onto the probe, a keg is supplied in the kit, which will not allow either a mirror or a magnet to slide off.  The data cable has USB on one side and archaic, but more reliable miniUSB on the other. <br><br>  The device records video and photo material on a flashcard, but only a piece of paper is included with a warning about the use of high-speed cards from famous manufacturers. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ec0/a9c/605/ec0a9c60528b451988d2f163cc8b79d5.jpg"><br><br>  Outwardly, the videomaster is a handle with a screen and a special connector to which a cable with a camera and a backlight is attached. <br><br>  Made of smooth plastic with controls on the front, which are the following buttons: (bottom to top, left to right) <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ Arrows, with their help there is a choice between interface elements, as well as adjustment of the brightness of the LEDs <br>  ‚Ä¢ OK, confirmation of the selected item <br>  ‚Ä¢ MENU, go to the instrument settings <br>  ‚Ä¢ Turn on / off device <br>  ‚Ä¢ Delete a file in view mode, change the magnification of the picture (ZOOM) <br>  ‚Ä¢ View footage <br>  ‚Ä¢ Removing video <br>  ‚Ä¢ Taking photos <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/471/7df/53d/4717df53d519495a9946962a25bf5428.jpg"><br><br>  At the bottom of the handle there is a manufacturer's logo.  In the hand is good, the device does not seem massive.  When turned on, the LED lights up, indicating the operation of the device. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/940/c00/d81/940c00d81e7f4f2c82d58848c27a4cde.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/0b2/368/6f4/0b23686f442647a2938c0416f79fc67a.jpg"><br><br>  <b>The main technical characteristics are as follows:</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f1b/c09/ac3/f1bc09ac351542fb9b565899368c7172.png"><br><br>  The connector for the probe connection is protruding from the housing, with a twisting rough washer <br><br>  To install the probe, it is necessary to place it in the correct position, pull the washer to the top and screw it clockwise, counter-clockwise - unscrew. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/779/cda/0f3/779cda0f38eb414b9f6e757a7da01adb.jpg"><br><br>  Above the screen there is a visor, possibly preventing illumination in the daytime.  On the right side of the device, hiding under the rubber cover, jack 3.5 and miniUSB sockets, as well as a slot for a microSD flash card <br><br>  The back side, in addition to the serial number, also has the device name and certificates, and the battery compartment cover under them.  This device is powered by 4 AA batteries, the manufacturer claims from 12 to 14 hours of operation from these batteries.  The probe itself is made of bending material, but taking any form, covered with something rubberized.  Its length is 98 cm. On one side there is a connector for connection to the device, and on the other side there is a video camera with a circle of LEDs (4 pieces in all) <br><br><br>  A tail is provided for proper installation into the connector.  Since the manufacturer declared tightness, then at the base of the mount there is a rubber ring as a seal.  For a more detailed view of the entire body, please look at the body from all sides. <br><br>  A small Phillips screwdriver is needed for disassembly.  Turn off the 4 screws on the perimeter of the back cover.  After that, gently lift the cover and turn the wires on its side, as they are soldered inside.  And unscrew another 5 screws.  The main components on the board are hidden by a metal plate.  The control unit board in the handle and the main one are 2 different boards interconnected by thin jumpers.  The reverse side of the front panel.  Let me remind you again that all the buttons are plastic.  Rubberized plug only connectors. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/96c/ff2/9eb/96cff29eb2ed40cf995097a4667b165c.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/9f2/270/c2c/9f2270c2c05e4ddda2d9d3abbae40609.jpg"><br><br>  When you turn on the endoscope, but without connecting the probe, an error will constantly pop up.  Therefore, all operations with the settings are made in a "combat" state. <br><br>  When you press the MENU key, we get to the System Settings tab, in which the following sections are located: <br>  ‚Ä¢ Language, choice among 10 available languages <br>  ‚Ä¢ Video system, choice of PAL or NTSC systems <br>  ‚Ä¢ Formatting <br>  ‚Ä¢ Factory settings <br>  ‚Ä¢ Software version <br>  ‚Ä¢ "Date Time" <br><br>  "Shooting settings" allow you to select the display of the current time on videos or photos and the frame rate when shooting a video.  (can vary from 5 to 30 fps).  "Play file", built-in gallery for viewing footage.  In standby mode, the display shows: <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ Battery charge scale <br>  ‚Ä¢ The value of the zoom can be changed from 1 to 3, in increments of 0.5 <br>  ‚Ä¢ Is the flashcard installed or not? <br>  ‚Ä¢ Current date and time <br><br>  Using the arrow keys, you can change the brightness level of the LEDs from 1 to 5. <br><br>  Also in standby mode, when you press the off key, the following happens: <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ First click - hides the entire display from the screen. <br>  ‚Ä¢ Second click - mirror the current image <br>  ‚Ä¢ Third click ‚Äî displays a picture at 180 degrees <br>  ‚Ä¢ Fourth click - mirror the current image <br><br>  All this is necessary for orientation in space, since the probe can be in any position. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a30/dfa/b17/a30dfab17c2c40aca2052c35a6ae602c.jpg"><br><br>  When used for non-professional purposes, the endoscope can go where the human eye could not get it.  Below are short videos taken in the same apartment. <br><br><br>  ‚Ä¢ Ceiling space wiring from the lamp <br><br><iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/ID6i9RADwhE%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700022,15700186,15700191,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhhEK54cCADVQXAMadLG7bwek6HceQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  ‚Ä¢ Dipping into the water and using a hook to raise the cork in the bathroom <br><br><iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/J99sVkAzkFo%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700022,15700186,15700191,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhit5oCkIeLsym0u6TCJ8B9jZ7XssA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  ‚Ä¢ Raising the screw under water with a magnetic nozzle <br><br><iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/rOlKmc5m-T0%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700022,15700186,15700191,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhjSMw4jK1LkJT8XsEMB6bdB2t9xUw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  ‚Ä¢ Sink in the bathroom <br><br><iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/jJMuMmUuKII%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700022,15700186,15700191,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhi0nxWytCpMyoSZRyp5QgfXcB0pcQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  All my videos with this djadget are <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/sbazarov91/videos%3Fview%3D0%26shelf_id%3D0%26sort%3Ddd">here</a> . <br><br>  <b>Positive sides</b> <br><br>  - Waterproof probe <br>  - To work enough to enable <br>  - Large screen <br>  - High autonomy <br>  - Study of hard to reach places <br><br>  <b>Negative sides</b> <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ High price <br>  ‚Ä¢ Plastic as stationery <br>  ‚Ä¢ No manual focusing possible. <br>  ‚Ä¢ No box provided for transportation <br>  ‚Ä¢ There is a gap between the probe connector <br><br>  Can I recommend <a href="http://dadget.ru/katalog/avto-moto-velo/endoskop-pro/%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes.ru%26utm_medium%3Darticle%26utm_term%3Dendoskop-pro%26utm_content%3Dendoskop-pro%26utm_campaign%3Dendoskop-pro_158">this device to purchase</a> ?
