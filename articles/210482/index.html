Their summary: <br><ol><li>  recognition of the existence of problems in the process of communication between the client and the designer, as well as some suggestions for their prevention and resolution; </li><li>  consistent coverage of the main stages of the site design (atypical design of a typical site) from the point of view of the advertiser. </li></ol><br><br>  Thus, a tripartite conflict of interest is obtained: <br><ul><li>  the designer wants pretty; </li><li>  it is important for the client to realize his vision, to convey his values; </li><li>  marketers need sales. </li></ul><br><br>  It would seem that each side has reasonable claims, which makes it difficult to resolve the conflict in favor of one of them.  As a rule, this is not required, because usually in the finished product aesthetic appeal harmonizes with effective communication between the brand and its audience.

      In other words, the designer is able to produce a pretty product that will satisfy the client‚Äôs ambitions and ensure sales.  In general, it seems to be part of his immediate duties. <br><br>  Although, as it was rightly noted by the authors of the previous posts, for the successful work of the freelance designer there is not enough knowledge of the theory of design and confident possession of the basic set of graphic packages.  It was proposed to raise the level of development, if it is not high enough, studying the literature on psychology, statistics, marketing (and other disciplines). <br><br>  I suggest under the cut to get acquainted with another opinion about how you can organize your workflow and avoid arguing with the client about the relevance of the chosen palette. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h4>  Project work </h4><br>  To work effectively, it is always a good idea to understand: <br><ul><li>  what is demanded of you and </li><li>  How can I do that. </li></ul><br>  That is, we need a clear goal and an excellent plan. <br>  Without going into details, the goal of the project is always to solve the problem of communication between the client and the audience.  Well, or to convey the client's message to consumers in a language they understand. <br><br>  Dizerahs usually deliver a message in several stages.  The scheme is also quite general, but the meaning can be caught: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e77/bf3/34c/e77bf334c99e523677a617289109c441.png"><br><br>  It makes no sense to dwell on it, especially considering the <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/210332/">advertiser's</a> detailed <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/210332/">story</a> about the same thing only in other words.  However, some explanations may be helpful: <br><br>  <b>At the beginning of development, the</b> client must provide the designer with a comprehensive brief.  Of course, to make a brief correctly is a whole science, and, perhaps, even art.  However, it is worth it to make every effort on both sides.  After all, the more time, money and nerves can be saved. <br><br>  <b>Planning.</b>  After getting acquainted with the brief, you can determine the development time, budget, work means, identify any technical limitations of the project. <br><br>  <b>Analysis.</b>  It does not hurt to collect all the available information about the client, its product, audience, competitors.  In many cases, you should take time to study the characteristics of the client‚Äôs business.  In addition, it is also a good idea to figure out what is happening in all these issues and understand how this will help in the work. <br><br>  <b>Development.</b>  Now you can take a pencil, storming ideas, developing concepts, sketching sketches.  When the time comes you can make a prototype and then work out the product in detail. <br><br>  <b>Feedback.</b>  Quite often, the client is included in the process only at this stage, when the designer gives a presentation of the work done.  Also, this may include testing.  After receiving the feedback, the dieser returns to the development stage and makes the necessary improvements, according to the customer‚Äôs comments or testing results.  Sometimes a project goes through quite a lot of iterations at this stage, which is often reflected in folklore. <br><br>  <b>Matching.</b>  The final stage in which the final version is approved and the product is ready for production. <br><br>  <b>Monitoring</b>  Well, sometimes they also conduct various studies, such as how the public reacted, so that there was something to analyze in the following developments. <br><br><h4>  How to reach an agreement with the client? </h4><br>  Here it would seem that there are few options: communication with the client is largely determined by personal characteristics. <br>  Consequently, it can be expected that the contact person will be (according to a rather arbitrary and subjective classification of the designer) <br><ul><li>  adequate either </li><li>  inadequate. </li></ul><br>  With the first category, everything is simple: brief - work - result. <br>  In the second case, there are options: <br><ul><li>  immediately abandon the project (usually, after receiving the brief, everything becomes obvious); </li><li>  abandon the project after a certain stage (as a rule, after the edits of the 35th version); </li><li>  courageously bring the project to the end without any regrets. </li></ul><br>  There is also an option when the decision is made not only by the contact person, but also by other persons whose opinion cannot be ignored.  By the way, they usually appear suddenly.  Often at the moment when the layout is sent, for example, to the printing house.  In general, in this version of the good is also small. <br>  Of course, not everything goes smoothly with fully adequate clients. <br>  And sometimes it slows down dithers. <br><br>  However, many troubles can be avoided if, for example, <br><ul><li>  conscientiously work out the compilation of the brief, </li><li>  draw up a contract corresponding to the current project, </li><li>  carefully plan your work </li><li>  argue your decisions and actions, </li><li>  listen to the customer </li><li>  to ensure sufficient participation of the client in the project, </li><li>  customer comments are accepted only in writing, </li><li>  explain to the client the failure of the solutions offered to them, </li><li>  make sure the client understands everything correctly, </li><li>  make sure the designer understands everything correctly </li><li>  think first. </li></ul><br><br>  Thus, working independently, it would be quite good for a designer to master the basics of some other specialties for effective work.  It is even better to understand the scheme of work on freelance at least at a basic level before the start of their own activities.  Although, perhaps, there is nothing terrible to learn from their mistakes. <br>  The need for communication with the client is not a burden.  This does not introduce any difficulties.  On the contrary, working intensively with him on the project, you can find a more effective solution.  However, you should also consider the possibility of not the most favorable development of relations with the client and have an appropriate strategy for this case. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/210482/">https://habr.com/ru/post/210482/</a></p>
