      A little about yourself and how it all began. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  I have long been engaged in the development of flash toys.  This is an interesting and fascinating thing, but at some point I began to realize that the flash is getting small and I should pay more attention to mobile development.  At that time, Android was still younger and did not cause much interest in me, so the choice fell in the direction of iOS.  Since I didn‚Äôt want to spend a lot of money on an unexplored platform, and there wasn‚Äôt much possibility, I was developing the first game in a virtual machine with huge brakes, constant crashes and hangs.  After a lot of torment with Obj-C and a large number of spent nerve cells, the game <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/go!-football/id467940845%3Fmt%3D8">Go!</a>  <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/go!-football/id467940845%3Fmt%3D8">Football</a> .  This game was pretty well received by players and visited the tops AppStore.  Not without the help of the publisher, but the experiment was successful, and I decided to continue the conquest of this platform. <br><br>  In order not to spend too much time, I decided to make a new game on the same engine as the previous one, only to redraw the graphics.  By the end of the work on the game, I realized that I did not want to run it through publishers and I want to try to do it myself.  It‚Äôs not that I didn‚Äôt like something in working with the publisher, on the contrary, everything was fine, just while working on flash games I somehow got used to the fact that the games belong to me and I can do with them what I want, but with the publisher control over the game is lost. <br><br>  Soberly assessing my strength and capabilities, I realized that I could not attract a sufficient number of audiences to the game, since I did not have any money for advertising or links to survey sites.  Therefore, it was decided not to rush to launch, make some more games and then release everything at the same time using cross-promo in games, which should increase the downloads of each of them, and if any of the games shoot, then pull the rest.  At that moment it seemed to me a great idea, but in practice everything turned out to be much more difficult.  Running even one game takes a lot of time and effort, which the rest of the game just does not remain and to pay enough attention to each of them there is no way. <br><br>  I will tell you about the development of the games themselves in the following posts, and now we are getting close to the moment of the birth of BeetlePlay. <br><br>  If I decided to launch the games myself and use the cross-promo, then they definitely needed a ‚Äúpublisher‚Äù site with an easy-to-remember name and a bright logo.  But nowadays it‚Äôs not easy to come up with a good name with a free domain.  The process of finding a suitable name lasted for several months, since it turned out to be not at all such a simple task as it seemed at first, especially since I devoted most of the time to development.  As soon as the games were finished, I began to think about the name day and night, and finally, my searches were crowned with success, and I immediately set about creating the site.  But then a new problem appeared, all of the logo variants that I had turned out, somehow did not please: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/399/dd0/dcb/399dd0dcbd4ff93a4a7fac2b371000ca.jpg"><br><br>  Then I decided to look for good luck on the side and announced a mini-contest, in the hope that people with a fresh look, if they could not come up with something suitable, then at least send me to a new course and a few days later one good person sent a version of the logo which immediately sunk into my soul: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/281/fed/cef/281fedcef19b8a73f8aa64dd7a747a14.png"><br><br>  The bug was very nice, but I didn‚Äôt really like the inscription, but I just had a suitable version of the letters, which in themselves looked rather boring.  Putting it together, I realized that I had found what I was looking for: <br> <a href="http://beetleplay.com/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/62b/e10/9e2/62be109e269421015c1b959fa6a4c447.jpg"></a> <br><br>  A few days later the site was completed and <a href="http://beetleplay.com/">BeetlePlay was</a> officially born. <br><br>  In the following posts you will learn more about the games and their development process. <br><br>  Want to keep up to date and follow the BeetlePlay news? <br><br>  Subscribe to our blog on Habr√©, <br>  Join <a href="https://twitter.com/BeetlePlay">Twitter</a> and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/BeetlePlay">Facebook</a> <br><br>  Thank you for your attention and see you soon! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/186272/">https://habr.com/ru/post/186272/</a></p>
