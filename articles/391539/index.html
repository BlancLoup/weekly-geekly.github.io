For me personally, a lot of different gadgets help me for this, so I want to tell you about the 10 most interesting and useful devices that I use either myself or my familiar car enthusiasts. <br><br><img src="https://usa.visa.com/content/dam/VCOM/Global%20Elements/Marquees/ThinkGeek_1600x900.jpg" alt="image"><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><br><h1>  1. Xiaomi Yi DVR DVR </h1><br>  Perhaps the most necessary car gadget is the DVR, because with the help of this device you can always fix everything that happens on the road and, thanks to this, it is much easier to prove your innocence in an accident.  But, the most important thing is that your registrar has a high-quality picture, so my choice is a Xiaomi Yi DVR.  This company has long proved that it is able to produce high-quality cameras for little money, more precisely for <a href="https://dronk.ru/shorten/lt">$ 68.99</a> *.  And for this money we get a resolution of 1920 x 1080, the ability to shoot 60fps, get photos in the resolution of 2048 x 1536, a review of 165 degrees and a photosensitivity of 1.8, that is, everything is also visible in the dark.

Antirain Aquapel </h2><br>  It is important not only to record the events on the road on the video, but also to see these same events.  And when it rains outside the window, it doesn't work very well.  And, to solve this problem, we need a hydrophobic liquid for the autoglasses Aquapel.  This is a plastic device with wings - when you press on which the capsule with the substance bursts - which must be immediately applied to the dry glass.  Judging by the reviews - this thing is not comparable with liquids from bottles.  They make it in the USA, but you can order it cheaper on ebay from China, where 10 pieces cost <a href="https://dronk.ru/shorten/m5">$ 36.99</a> .  If you order from the USA, then with delivery for 6pcs it will be about <a href="https://dronk.ru/shorten/m6">$ 40</a> .  By the way, in Russia you can also buy it - at 500r per 1 pc. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/2f5/894/f6f/2f5894f6f12ed7699679655db8b5f953.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><br><h2>  3. Headlamp with IR control </h2><br>  In my glove compartment there is always a headlamp flashlight and there are a lot of cases when he rescued me greatly.  No special bells and whistles are needed for such a car flashlight, so this headrest for <a href="https://dronk.ru/shorten/lu">$ 10</a> * seemed to me a great option.  It can be charged in the car from USB, one charge lasts for about 2 hours and 30 minutes and it has a funny function of turning it on or off with a wave of the arm in front of a flashlight.  Not that it was very useful, but it may well come in handy if your hands are dirty or you don‚Äôt want to search by touch where there is an on / off button. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/38e/dc7/965/38edc7965c4dd16a1fede0bf5aa867e8.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><br><h2>  4. Two USB Chargers from 1 cigarette lighter for $ 1 </h2><br>  Nowadays, people have so many handheld gadgets that it‚Äôs hard to overestimate the convenience of having USB charging in each car for each of them, especially if this charge on the stock costs a little more than <a href="https://dronk.ru/shorten/lv">$ 1</a> .  I have a built-in USB port in my car, but when I insert my phone into it for charging, the radio tape recorder is trying hard to find and play something there.  So a separate USB charging that I can insert into the cigarette lighter helps a lot. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/d20/e4b/a6d/d20e4ba6db6a751a40e2400a05c510f9.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><br><h2>  5. Mostly VHF radio in the car </h2><br>  For lovers of long-distance travel, a small VHF radio station - Qyt KYT8900 will be useful.  It costs <a href="https://dronk.ru/shorten/lw">$ 82</a> , which is not very expensive for this type of device, but you shouldn‚Äôt expect the quality of top models either.  That is, for rare trips, it is suitable (along with a good antenna), but if you are a professional long-haul, then look at something more expensive - for example, TYT TH-9800 for <a href="https://dronk.ru/shorten/lx">$ 225.70</a> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/faf/084/7c1/faf0847c1b9c058cf379e31f555895ca.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><br><h2>  6. Pump for pumping oil from the car engine through the dipstick </h2><br>  Once I needed to pump out some oil through the dipstick and this task turned out to be quite non-trivial - I had to use all my resourcefulness to accomplish this task with the help of a catheter and a syringe from the pharmacy.  It would be much easier to do this with this pump at hand.  And in general, you can easily change the oil without searching for the pit and without removing the crankcase protection, which is naturally much more convenient.  Moreover, the issue price is about <a href="https://dronk.ru/shorten/ly">$ 29</a> *. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/6ed/4cd/264/6ed4cd26409e2c6da0ded10d50e3bbd1.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><br><h2>  7. Ovevo Q8 - bluetooth headset for motorists </h2><br>  Statistics say that many accidents occur because of conversations behind the wheel, so the traffic police recommends either to abandon conversations on the road, or in general, or use a special headset.  Headsets are made for a long time and the most different, but I have never met a similar to the Ovevo Q8.  Insert the device into the cigarette lighter and, when you need to talk, just take out the earpiece, insert it into your ear and talk.  And after the conversation, you can safely return it to the place so that it is not lost and discharged.  It also has a USB connector that can be used to charge devices.  Price of the gadget - <a href="https://dronk.ru/shorten/m0">$ 22.41</a> * <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Photos in the ear and cigarette lighter</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/bec/0a0/937/bec0a0937605bc321c82b9660c522f6c.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/a51/a36/b5d/a51a36b5dee6371068f80f49d959e9c0.jpg" alt="image"><br></div></div><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/60b/abd/6a1/60babd6a18988d884a9d58a6dbb56bf6.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><br><br><h2>  8. BlitzWolf¬Æ K3 Starter </h2><br>  Probably every motorist at least once in his life forgot to turn off the light, except for those people who immediately started driving cars that reported that the light was still on.  And, the result of such forgetfulness is often a completely discharged battery, which must be given a ‚Äúlight‚Äù.  If at this moment BlitzWolf K3 turns out to be close, then you will not have to prank friends with cars or stop strangers.  And also he will solve the problem with a discharged phone or just highlight the path.  In general, a little thing can help out in some unpleasant situations, if you <a href="https://dronk.ru/shorten/m1">splurge</a> once on <a href="https://dronk.ru/shorten/m1">$ 64.98</a> * to buy it. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/35f/7d1/de8/35f7d1de8f61be909e17d3adec932439.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><br><br><h2>  9. Tool for removing dents on the auto Pops-a-Dent </h2><br>  It is extremely unpleasant to see a small dent in your car, leaving the store or the house.  But minor accidents in the courtyards and parking lots occur all the time and sometimes we really do not want to wait for the traffic police, and how much money then for repair should be paid.  But is it so scary if you left a dent?  Tool Pops-a-Dent proves that it is not scary.  We glue the central part, install the device, pull the middle and no dents anymore.  And the issue price is only <a href="https://dronk.ru/shorten/m2">$ 6.25</a> *.  Although it is worth noting, but this is not a magic wand and it will not be able to straighten very small dents - only those that are really pulled out in this way. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">I think more clearly about the work will tell this video</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/RJ6m6AwEcTk%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700023,15700186,15700191,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhgTYR73bRcOzBI2IQ_W3JKZYKFZnA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br></div></div><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/3a8/cbc/55e/3a8cbc55e3a499c627a3c34b6882fe62.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><br><br><h2>  10. Car speakerphone, no need to charge </h2><br>  Well, the last, but far from the most uninteresting, I will tell you about the speakerphone on solar batteries.  Obviously, not everyone likes to communicate with the device in the ear - where it is more convenient to speak simply through the speakerphone, so you can simply stick this gadget to the uppermost part of the windshield (so as not to interfere) and just use the convenient device.  That is, those who do not like headsets can also protect themselves, both from fines for talking on the phone and from accidents.  And this gadget will cost <a href="https://dronk.ru/shorten/m3">$ 24</a> *. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/f7e/73b/f32/f7e73bf32b37d0ebbce845889ce134f3.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  ps And for those who came here to look at the charger in the form of R2-D2, that on the title page - here is a link to <a href="https://dronk.ru/shorten/m4">Amazon</a> <br><br>  That's all, with you there was a simple service for choosing sophisticated <a href="https://dronk.ru/">Dronk.Ru</a> equipment.
