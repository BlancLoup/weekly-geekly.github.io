  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Funding Theory for a Startup</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Hello dear readers. <br><br>  In this article I would like to dwell on such important points as an assessment of the need for borrowed funds, a decision on their involvement, effective forms of organizing a start-up company and the cost of attracted resources. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  Determining the need for financial resources </h4><br>  In the beginning, it is necessary to determine the need for financial resources.  That is, the cumulative amount of funds necessary to ensure all stages of the project. <br>  There are 3 generally accepted methods for assessing the need for cash: <br><ol><li>  Balance - the definition of the required amount of assets that allow you to start an activity.  Moreover, the composition of assets has its own characteristics: there are no long-term assets in the composition of non-current assets;  in the composition of working capital - receivables.  The need for cash (on the current account) is calculated on the basis of the planning of labor costs, advance and tax payments, and marketing on the basis of a 3-month requirement. </li><li>  The method of analogies - based on the amount of resources used in similar projects.  At the same time, the existing requirements and differences of projects are highlighted.  If an investor is often confronted with a direction similar to yours, he may use this scheme.  For a startup, this is the worst option. </li><li>  The specific capital intensity - the simplest of the methods, is based on the calculation of the indicator of the capital intensity of production per 1 unit of production. </li></ol><br><br><h4>  On Forms of Startup Company Organization </h4><br>  From the investor‚Äôs point of view, any ‚Äústartup = venture‚Äù is an axiom, so to speak.  Thus, it is necessary to begin to clarify what a venture is.

      <i>Venture is a small business engaged in experimental development or other high-tech work, thanks to which risky projects are carried out.</i> <br><br>  Thus, for an investor, 3 forms of financing your startup will be rational: <br><ol><li>  Reorganization of your company into a venture enterprise in which the equity capital (hereinafter, the UK) will be based on the mutual participation of the investor (s) and yours. </li><li>  Reorganization of your company into a joint-stock company with a subsequent increase in the insurance company through the issue of ordinary shares. </li><li>  Lending your project. </li></ol><br>  The first 2 options are more preferable for a startup;  they lack regress on the borrower, in case of failure you owe nothing to anyone.  You risk only invested funds.  However, there may be a loss of control over the project and the company as a whole.  In the case of loans, the investor will offer you the participation of personal real estate, for example - a mortgage, which can turn into big problems for you. <br><br><h4>  Sources of financial resources </h4><br>  In world practice, there are 2 main branches to raise funds: <br><ol><li>  Internal sources (retained earnings, revaluation of fixed assets). </li><li>  External sources (issuing shares, issuing bonds, obtaining loans). </li></ol><br>  In this article I will focus only on the consideration of external sources of raising funds. <br><br><h4>  Determining the cost of attracted resources </h4><br>  Before directly estimating the cost of borrowed resources, it is necessary to emphasize that the cost of resources for the borrower! = Income of the lender.  This is due to the fact that the cost of resources for the borrower is adjusted by the amount of the tax shield. <br><br>  <i>Tax shield - the effect arising from the restructuring of the company's capital.</i>  <i>It lies in the fact that the amount of corporate tax, which is subject to equity capital, is reduced due to an increase in the share of borrowed capital.</i>  <i>Trite, tax shields - the planned savings in tax payments.</i> <br><br><h5>  Cost of debt financing sources </h5><br>  The cost of raising capital as a result of issuing bonds (irrevocable and with a fixed income coupon) is calculated on the basis of the equation determining their market value: <br><br>  P = ‚àë ((CF * (1 - h) / (1 + r) ^ t) + N / (1 + r) ^ T <br><br>  CF - regular amounts paid on coupons of bonds (coupon payments); <br>  N is the nominal value of the bond; <br>  T is the maturity period of the bond; <br>  t is the period; <br>  r -% rate; <br>  h - the rate of income tax; <br>  R - the value of the bond. <br><br>  Simplified solution of this equation for r: <br><br>  r = (N * q * (1 - h) + (N - P) / T) / (N + P) / 2 <br><br>  r is the percentage value of attracted resources on the bond; <br>  h - the rate of income tax; <br>  q - the amount of coupon payments; <br>   - expenses on issue; <br><br><h5>  Cost of equity sources </h5><br>  To estimate the value of these sources, it is advisable to divide them into: <br><br>  <b>Share capital in the form of preferred shares</b> - since they are paid a fixed percentage of the nominal value, the cost is calculated: <br><br>  rPA = Dpa / (P-Zr) <br><br>  Dpa - dividend payments for the year; <br>   - the market price of the share at the time of valuation. <br>  Sp - the cost of placing on one share. <br><br>  <b>Share capital in the form of ordinary shares</b> <br><br>  ra = (D1 / (P-3p)) + q <br><br>  In the case of uniformly accelerated growth (the formula is simplified by using the equation of perpetuation) the dividend formula will be: <br><br>  ra = D1 / ((1-q) -Zp) <br><br>  Due to the fact that this formula does not take into account the risk of the company, it is advisable to use the CAPM model. <br><br>  ra = rb + Œ≤ (rm - rb) <br><br>  rb - risk free rate; <br>  Œ≤ is the beta coefficient; <br>  rm - market rate. <br><br><h4>  Conclusion </h4><br>  Thus, we reviewed the main methods for assessing the need for financial resources, effective forms of organizing a start-up company and learned how to calculate the cost of attracted resources on the terms of issuing bonds and additional issue of shares. <br><br>  <b>PS</b> In case of any questions regarding the presentation of the article, venture and project financing, I will be happy to help you with them. <br><br>  <b>PPS</b> All definitions are taken from the site - Wikipedia. <br><br>  <b>PPPS</b> If articles of this format will appeal to the community, then in the next article I will talk about how an investor evaluates start-up projects, what indicators he focuses on and how he reduces his risks. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/136141/">https://habr.com/ru/post/136141/</a></p>
