  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Before xe3</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><h4>  Delphi, angle of view </h4><br>  Recently, the cases of generation of all sorts of rumors, plums and landslides, which, oddly enough, are very welcome.  Such phenomena have an intrinsic characteristic of propagation in a self-sustaining mode or, who likes it, the transition to self-oscillation mode.  The tendency to negative interpretation of information-thematic outliers requires the correct setting of the telescope tripod, since  it is clear even to the anti-virus that it is very difficult to focus even on a fixed object while standing in a hammock stretched between the masts of a sailboat in the open sea.  Moreover, our object is quite mobile, and its trajectory does not always represent an ideal straight line, which is characteristic of the development of any IT technology.  But now we will talk about the current state of the product called Delphi.  And for this you need to look at what is happening a little bit differently (= as unbiased as possible). <a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h4>  Human Resource </h4><br>  Initially, IT-technologies were very closely associated with personalities, because  one person could cover with his work a very specific food piece.  Until now, we know the technology partners of Delphi (although it is more correct to write Embarcadero), the main production capacity of which is encapsulated (and hidden more than protected) in an individual skull of an arbitrary degree of baldness.  But now it‚Äôs a pleasant but rare thing, and the inert thinking of the majority of active Delphi-sympathizers continues to look for a singleton, which should be either glorified or cursed.  And the outcome of such a person from the company is perceived as a catastrophe, commensurate with the death of an atomic strategic submarine.  I want to draw the following analogy, even the departure of the chief designer, who for years determined not only the ideology of creation, but also the direction of development (for example) of the weapon system, in a very uncritical way affects its survival.  But IT analysts like to draw little analogies, firmly convincing themselves and their audiences of the uniqueness of this field.  But it is easy to invent their own terminology (such as ‚Äúagile‚Äù), but we will leave the undermining of the belief in one‚Äôs exclusivity for later. <br><br>  There is such a thing - ‚Äútoo comfortable conditions‚Äù.  You can start from everyday examples when a wife / husband stops practicing even if he is self-improving, knowing that the second half is not going anywhere (you don‚Äôt have to pull in your IT belly, it‚Äôs with you forever).  For a manager (closer to the corporate environment), 2-3 years is the critical time when he has already worked with partners, made friends with his colleagues and taught his subordinates to spit on his bad mood.  In good corporations (and this is again the news of 100 years ago) there is a program of "rotation", when specialists who have too optimized their labor costs by the criterion of price / quality, pull to a new place, forcing the stone to be re-accelerated.  I can not make a remark towards the reader.  If you can do nothing for 1 working day (this is called ‚Äúrefactoring‚Äù), then too comfortable conditions take place here.  Who saw yourself (if you are an honest person) +1 in the comments.  Unfortunately / fortunately you are inalienable from your source code, so it is cheaper to feed you than to fire.

    <h4>  All my life I gave Delphi </h4><br>  It is these phrases that clearly indicate a person looking at the picture ‚ÄúOver Eternal Peace‚Äù.  And then you really have to return to the initial topic of analysis of the evolution of Delphi (very briefly, as in a school history textbook, long live the past day of knowledge).  At first, there was nothing but Delphi, so it‚Äôs very easy to do things that are quite understandable (component-based development + RAD + visual + IDE) - so accessible that it was not clear at first how others did not do it (someone remembers Symantec C ++ with a visual editor?), many too quickly turned into a monument.  Then (hand on heart) with Delphi 1 to Delphi 7, nothing comparable with FireMonkey was done (poor-poor Kylix, he was just unlucky).  The version numbers flashed, but there was no going beyond the ‚Äúhuman, object-oriented Windows API with a good IDE‚Äù.  And the aura of the ‚Äúgreats‚Äù not only continued to hover over the company's employees (it was so easy and without fireworks that it descended from the long marathon of development tools), but also to hinder progress.  Once sitting on the sofa in front of the TV, a person forgets that watching what is happening is not part of what is happening.  And the care of quite specific employees of the company means only that they were carried out in hibernation mode along with the easy chair into the woods to the gray young hungry coders.  A clear illustration of this is the arrival of Yevgeny Kryukov as an ideologue and the strengthening of the Russian team in St. Petersburg, which could not have happened without the absolutely reasonable "burning of excess fat" in the country where this really is a problem. <br><br><h4>  Release XE3 </h4><br>  It is an absolutely logical continuation of the adopted strategy for creating multi-platform development tools.  It can be concentrated in three FM2 symbols. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/150847/">https://habr.com/ru/post/150847/</a></p>
