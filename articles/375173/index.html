New Year's Eve has already arrived in some places, to someone else follows, well, I have a New Year's gift for you.  Great post about six gaming mice in different price categories from six different vendors.  Need a new fighting girlfriend?  Not decided on a gift for the New Year for yourself?  Choose a challenger and go! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ac4/c0d/ef7/ac4c0def799341609322529bdb9d0d62.jpg"><br><br>  In this issue today: <b>ASUS</b> Gladius, <b>Mad Catz</b> RAT7, <b>Cooler Master</b> Storm Reaper, <b>Defender</b> Warhead, <b>Roccat</b> Tyon and <b>SteelSeries</b> Rival. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  To begin with, we will get acquainted with all the devices, then we will run the test on different surfaces, then I will try to summarize.

      <b>UPD:</b> prices for devices are indicated ‚Äúpre-crisis, and since I can‚Äôt turn my language around as the current state of affairs is normal, I‚Äôll leave them so that you, as an audience, understand what ruble value my estimate came from.  Actual prices will also be indicated, thanks to Yandex Market for them. <br><br>  <b><a href=""><b>Defender</b> Warhead 1310</a></b> <br>  <b><b>Defender</b></b> has been on the market for computer peripherals for a long time; mice and keyboards of this company never claimed the top segment, but they were quite a normal solution for those who are satisfied with ‚Äújust a mouse and just a keyboard‚Äù.  Works good.  Broke - bought a new one.  Warhead is an attempt to master a new audience, and the attempt, I must say, successful.  On the Yulmart website, only <a href="http://www.ulmart.ru/goods/538216">910 rubles</a> were asked for a mouse, it was possible to find <a href="">cheaper</a> prices on Yandex Market.  Current price is as follows: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/f6b/938/e77/f6b938e7792613f965b75b318a0ac3cb.png"><br><br>  The mouse is made of two types of plastic, glossy (on the upper part) and matte (sidewall and lower part), on the left, under the thumb - a rubberized insert.  You understand how much you don‚Äôt wipe and do not photoshop - the mouse will collect all the prints, all the dust and dirt that you want. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/04f/afa/38b/04fafa38b964467ea09c18472862f72b.jpg"><br><br>  The design is designed exclusively for right-handers, the buttons of the mouse are six, the wheel is one, covered with a rubber ring. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/dcf/598/8ac/dcf5988acb6e424fa3e155488a8914ca.jpg"><br><br>  The body itself is large, designed to capture only the full palm, in the hand is excellent.  All buttons are pressed confidently, click - clear, assembly and casting look better than the model Aerocool.  The mouse has its own set of drivers and it is even <a href="">updated</a> . <br><br>  <b><a href="http://www.asus.com/Gaming/ROG_Gladius/"><b>ASUS</b> Gladius</a></b> <br>  <b><b>ASUS</b></b> has been around for a long time in the game and around the game get-together, it works great with the audience and does what they ask.  Gladius was no exception.  About this mouse the most detailed material was written by NeoForce, it is possible to get acquainted with it on GT <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/ulmart/blog/236533/">here</a> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/1a4/56d/e3f/1a456de3f2c54857bedf982d01f47b44.jpg"><br><br>  The mouse was on sale only in Yulmart, now, probably, has ended.  The last time I looked, the price was about 3,500 rubles.  What now - I do not know, but we will proceed from the price of 90-110 green presidents.  On the 4Frag website, <a href="http://4frag.ru/igrovye-myshi-89/asus-gladius.html">4200</a> are asked for pre-order.  The price is normal. <br><br>  Body materials - semi-matt plastic and rubberized inserts.  Buttons only 5, the wheel - one, covered with a nice rubber ring. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/0a4/1b0/9e3/0a41b09e3f49427d94539cf8d56d24f6.jpg"><br><br>  In his hand is like a top mouse of one extremely popular brand associated with snakes.  The form is designed exclusively for right-handed, medium-sized mouse.  DPI is adjustable from 50 to 6400, polling frequency - from 250 to 2000 HZ.  By itself, the device leaves an extremely positive impression.  The shape of the case, build quality, delivery equipment, packaging - it is clear that they took care of all this. <br><br>  <b><a href="http://gaming.coolermaster.com/ru/products/mice/reaper/"><b>Cooler Master</b> Storm Reaper</a></b> <br>  <b><b>Cooler Master</b></b> , like <b>ASUS</b> , needs no introduction.  True, its main range - cooling systems and computer cases.  In spite of this, the company has extensive experience in working with a wide variety of materials + experience in designing high-quality things, and this is worth a lot. <br><br>  <b>Reaper</b> on the Market cost nearly <a href="">4 thousand rubles</a> , made in the classic form factor.  The case is of medium size, neutral shape with sharpening on the "right-handed". <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e92/a85/a5c/e92a85a5c5ab4750ad5e6b3a358d3bd2.jpg"><br><br>  You can use your left hand, but pressing the little buttons on the side buttons is difficult.  The case materials are the most noble, aluminum and ‚Äúsilk‚Äù soft-touch plastic.  Buttons 7, one wheel, made of a single piece of aluminum, heavy, corrugated and with very confident clicks both when scrolling and when pressed.  The course of the buttons is excellent, everything works as it should. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/6ff/1dd/5f9/6ff1dd5f94164ec09b684e8560a0e123.jpg"><br><br>  At the time of publication, the actual price tag was around 4,990, but how much a mouse costs at the time of reading can be seen here on this graph: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/19e/b0f/b05/19eb0fb051a27244967f9a6dea1d0e6b.png"><br><br>  DPI is adjustable from 100 to 8200, the maximum polling frequency is 1000 Hz. <br><br>  <b><a href="http://steelseries.com/ru/products/mice/steelseries-rival"><b>SteelSeries</b> Rival</a></b> <br>  <b><b>SteelSeries</b></b> - well-known manufacturer of gaming devices.  Mice and keyboards enjoy a fairly pleasant reputation and belong to the ‚Äúreliable things for reasonable money‚Äù segment. <br><br>  <b>Rival</b> - another mouse for almost <a href=""><s>4 thousand</s></a> .  It belongs to the high-end segment, is quite popular and is generally considered a good way to spend money on a means to move the cursor.  :) The price is in the picture. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/bef/211/ab6/bef211ab6551e4590757f6705254651e.png"><br><br>  The body is large, full palm grip.  The mouse is very high and "humped", but this does not prevent it from a drop: the shape is successful, although as neutral as possible.  Work comfortably. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d24/d7b/317/d24d7b3172db498e86292eb04d97eb0a.jpg"><br><br>  The case materials are two - matte almost soft-touch plastic and rubberized sidewalls with aggressive ribbing.  By the way, the rubber is very pleasant tactile and well textured - the mouse in the hand does not slide at all, it is <em>like</em> to touch it.  There are only five buttons, one wheel, with high-quality rubber coating.  The click, in my opinion, is a bit light and the return is not felt, but, in general, everything is quite informative and there are no false positives. <br><br>  DPI is adjustable from 100 to 6500, the maximum polling frequency is 1000 Hz. <br><br>  <a href="http://store.madcatz.com/categories/mice-category/Mad-Catz-RAT-7-Gaming-Mouse-for-PC-and-Mac.html"><b>Mad Catz</b> RAT7 2013 Matte Black USB</a> <br>  <b><b>Mad Catz</b></b> , formerly known as Cyborg - not to say that novices are new to the gaming device market, but the company is quite young.  Their mice of the RAT family have long stirred up the Internet with their photos, now the company produces a lot of things besides mice, but the post is only about computer rodents, so we‚Äôll get to know other peripherals after the new year. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/107/26d/2a7/10726d2a79214788af5ffd9947517cdb.jpg"><br><br>  On the Market for the mouse asked for as much as <a href="">4,800</a> rubles.  Today, prices soared to indecent 6-9 thousand, but on the OZON there were exactly yesterday copies in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãquite humane five thousand. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/e3b/589/bb5/e3b589bb582428186508216e89627481.png"><br><br>  Appearance to describe a little sense.  The case materials are the most premium ones - aluminum, high-quality plastic, nice rubberized surfaces.  The mouse can change its size and shape (there are interchangeable parts, the rear part extends, the weight of the mouse changes with weights), but is calculated by itself primarily on the finger and intermediate grip. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/6ec/3aa/996/6ec3aa99645746a694542457a57622db.jpg"><br><br>  Yes, the back part can be ‚Äúset‚Äù, but the palm grip for me personally will not be the most comfortable because of the gap between the ‚Äúheel‚Äù of the mouse and the surface with the buttons.  You can change the weight (a total of 30 grams, 5 weights of 6 grams each are fixed inside), and the center of gravity (by changing the weights with the springs).  Excellent customization for any user. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a4a/f9e/396/a4af9e396dd04ea0856aa1e24998d8e2.jpg"><br><br>  Buttons, by the way, 6 + swing DPI.  Wheels - two, one in the center, one - next to the thumb.  All the clicks are very confident, the return is at the optimum level, the mouse is extremely disposable for constant use both at home and at work, at least buy two, so as not to carry it back and forth.  DPI is adjustable from 100 to 6400, the maximum polling frequency is 1000 Hz. <br><br>  <b><a href=""><b>Roccat</b> tyon</a></b> <br>  <b><b>Roccat</b></b> has been present on the gaming device market for quite a long time, it competes with top manufacturers and aggressively introduces new features into its devices.  Tyon is no exception. <br><br>  The mouse is expensive, the price on the Internet was at the level of <a href="">6 thousand</a> rapidly devaluing Russian money. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/5a4/e33/543/5a4e335438478106a0d26940a0b7a47a.png"><br><br>  The mouse is just covered with various buttons, there is a wheel and a half, a two-position "comb" in the center, in general, see the photo, it's useless to describe this miracle: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d7e/9f3/05c/d7e9f305c2f148c5a56fd6fa36ccf98d.jpg"><br><br>  In addition, all buttons have a kind of ALT, allowing them to use the second function.  The size of the case is average, the mouse itself is perfectly in the hand.  The materials of the case are semi-soft plastic for the buttons and the upper surface and rough, somewhat similar to carbon fiber - for the side. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/507/a7a/d2e/507a7ad2eb4e45ef9b8d6fe78f4230d7.jpg"><br><br>  All buttons are pressed with confidence, the click output is clear, it is felt that the manufacturer has not regretted the time and money for the development of the device. <br><br>  DPI is adjustable from 100 to 8200, the maximum polling frequency is 1000 Hz. <br><br><h1>  Battle tests </h1><br>  The test algorithm is the same for everyone.  Connect, put the driver, make the initial setup.  Use the mouse for a day as usual, play three different toys, taste the software, compare work on different surfaces.  Each mouse gets 10 starting points by the fact of its existence, from which a certain amount will be deducted for the construction‚Äôs shoals and quality of work, and the points will be added for features and pleasant features.  At the end, the points will be multiplied by 100 and divided by the price of the device, so we will try to determine who made the most interesting mouse in its price range.  :) <br><br><h1>  Soft </h1><br>  <b>Defender</b> took care of the customization of his rodent, complete with a disk with everything you need.  I just downloaded the current version on the Internet.  The software is universal for the entire product line, if you suddenly have two mice from the <b>Defender of</b> the Warhead family at home, you will not need to install another firewood. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/ed1/fbc/cb3/ed1fbccb33f842c2a4b2080379a5f2f6.png"><br><br>  The application is simple and effective.  You can reassign any buttons, except for the one that is responsible for DPI, adjust the sensitivity of the sensor and create several profiles by linking them to applications being launched. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/d3e/10f/7a5/d3e10f7a5a8a15ee0fedc5de4d4e0cfd.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/c29/cce/014/c29cce014daf4258ebe864ce60762ed3.png"><br><br>  There are drawbacks to the software, but for a mouse for 900 rubles they are not significant: by default, the buttons in the software are ‚Äúnot assigned‚Äù (although they function as they should), and the profiles do not always switch perfectly.  Well, there are pluses.  First, the software exists.  At a mouse with such a price!  Secondly, it implements all the basic functions without problems, it works on any OS and looks nice.  Well, it is very easy to learn. <br><br>  <b><b>ASUS</b> Gladius</b> <br>  Gladius is ready to boast of a whole "armory."  Yes, yes, they just called the software: ROG Armory.  The software has been analyzed in great detail in the post-review from NeoForce, I will single out the main thing: in spite of the not very simple interface, the software performs all the functions 100%.  Buttons are reassigned. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/7ac/e88/f2a/7ace88f2ad7f780b70b0c0add8fd4d48.png"><br><br>  Macros are written. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/976/05f/c2d/97605fc2d13c3c6b562ca76028ec4bc0.png"><br><br>  The parameters for moving the cursor are very flexible. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/ca2/025/a3d/ca2025a3decfcbf95b2a250aa28882b5.png"><br><br>  Profiles are there and are switched.  The main thing is that the software allows you to calibrate the optical sensor for any surface.  Both presets and auto-detect / fit are available.  I have never seen such a feature yet, it works great. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/25d/6df/afc/25d6dfafc8fb8a2afffd5974a9080d2a.png"><br><br>  The mouse can be customized really for themselves and under the existing conditions.  The cursor turns into a surgeon's scalpel, moves exactly as it should, smoothness and accuracy at altitude.  If your mouse brains or software are not the latest, you will be upgraded to the latest version when connected. <br><br>  The advantages of the software solution from <b>ASUS are</b> undoubted.  There is software, mastering as much space as possible, Russian language is supported, the cursor behavior is configured according to all possible parameters, sensor calibration is available for any working surface, there are fully working macros with a sane interface and auto-update of both software and firmware. <br><br>  <b><b>Cooler Master</b> Storm Reaper</b> <br>  "The Reaper" is ready to boast of proprietary software, allowing about the same as all the others.  Profiles are there and are switched.  Buttons reassigned. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/b5d/100/f42/b5d100f42736d1e561b06b99f2dd354a.png"><br><br>  Sensitivity levels can be configured as many as four times, and differently for each of the axes and with a different pooling rate: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/46f/8be/331/46f8be3314c7e970b9f346dad5bef239.png"><br><br>  In addition, there is a shortcut to the system settings.  Fine!  But the macro recording interface is a bit overloaded, where to start is not clear.  This affects many.  :( <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/56d/91e/5c3/56d91e5c316026de39ba07ad57c5fe8b.png"><br><br>  Macros can be exported / imported, which is also a plus.  I would not like to repeat these circles of hell with their record, it‚Äôs better to back it up. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/28f/10a/b36/28f10ab36ff699d96235527698ad3e1b.png"><br><br>  Auto update firmware mouse or software is not implemented.  Go to the site and make pens.  :( <br><br>  One of the advantages is the presence of software, the relative ease of use, the ability to configure four DPI profiles on one mouse profile, the chic macro settings and import / export. <br><br>  <b><b>SteelSeries</b> Rival</b> <br>  Rival was one of the first SteelSeries mice to get the new Engine 3 platform. It is a bit like Razer Synapse and allows you to configure all the hardware supported by it from a single manufacturer in a single interface.  Convenient and practical. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/39d/237/608/39d237608f7776d4df7873f7b89c397b.png"><br><br>  The interface was developed by people and for people, not aliens from a small planet somewhere in the vicinity of Betelgeuse, so you can put +1 ahead of time for it.  If you choose a device from other manufacturers, and assign application profiles to it, then SS does the opposite: you select an application and add device configurations to it. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/9d4/c14/511/9d4c145113fb22924a6f90e366021386.png"><br><br>  Conveniently?  Yes, yes, yes, and a thousand more times.  The software itself, by the way, is not a ‚Äúwindow to hell‚Äù with an unchanged window size, you can resize as you please.  If everything does not fit, a scroll bar or a second column of control elements will appear, depending on the size of the window.  Thanks again for the clever interface.  Mouse settings, in principle, are visible in the screenshot: buttons are reassigned, cursor behavior is adjusted. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/d5c/adb/4c6/d5cadb4c63a97013c17a81e2181ed9da.png"><br><br>  The list of configurations is also available from the device menu, it is convenient to use it, there is no need to run back and forth: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/887/9fa/6f4/8879fa6f4b41482f66a5a045f0620118.png"><br><br>  Macros are recorded simply and clearly.  No need to sit with a book and figure out what you are doing, how it works.  The instruction is not needed, such Apple-style is in the best of times of the company.  Turn on and use. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/6da/5ca/014/6da5ca014cd35895a02ff786d8d52a75.png"><br><br>  The mouse backlight is also quite flexible, but this is all bells and whistles, it has nothing to do with the functionality itself. <br><br>  Plus not count.  There is software, moreover, with the system approach, like that of Razer, there are also available: a very thoughtful and convenient interface, flexibility of settings and convenient profile management, auto-update of both software and firmware of devices. <br><br>  <b>RAT7</b> <br>  Cyberconstructor is infinitely beautifully assembled and looks, what can not be said about its software.  First, it is capricious.  By itself, it may simply not get up.  The support in this case gives only one piece of advice: it is recommended to remove all other firewood and software of the mice, which is strange: they do not interfere with the rest.  And if you have, for example, a SteelSeries keyboard, or, worse, a Razer, which has one software with a mouse?  :( However, the questions to the creators of the software began with the process of downloading it. I moved from the <a href="http://www.cyborggaming.com/prod/rat7.htm">http://www.cyborggaming.com/prod/rat7.htm</a> section to the ‚Äúdownloads‚Äù and got to the page where you need to look again your OS and product. <a href="http://www.madcatz.com/downloads/">http: // www. <b>Mad Catz</b> .com / downloads /</a> <br><br>  The software weighs an impressive 123 megabytes, with the mouse ‚Äúdriver‚Äù (another 12.5 megabytes) above downloading separately. <br><br>  In the very same application, since the days of Cyborg, only the logo and the color scheme have changed in the software.  :( <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/690/f21/109/690f211094719547625fd28ee12bca53.png"><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Find one difference</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/e5a/cad/c41/e5acadc41631e5ea47bf02407aae132d.png"><br></div></div><br><br>  Sensitivity levels can be configured separately for the two axes, they will be clicked through the non-remapable swing under the wheel.  Separate profiles can also be created; they are switched by the button to the left of the LMB.  This pluses software ends.  I couldn‚Äôt get a second wheel or assign anything to it.  Even the built-in viewer does not see it.  Many players hang up the volume control on this wheel, I would have hung up the zoom in Photoshop and the browser. <br><br>  <b>UPD2: I</b> ‚Äôm pretty googling and looking for a solution to the problem on the forums, I found that some still managed to start the side wheel and the normal reassignment of the keys, but I was not morally ready for such tests.  :) In principle, the mouse works almost perfectly out of the box, and the only thing that I have customized for myself is its shape, otherwise it suited me ‚Äúas it is‚Äù, and the software, unlike the hardware, is gainable. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/ae6/9d6/393/ae69d6393a705b39f52bed6ae370fb02.png"><br><br>  Separate mention is the interface for writing macros.  In general, it was developed by aliens.  Its undoubted plus is that you can write down the ‚Äúbeginning‚Äù, the repeating middle and ‚Äúend‚Äù of the macro.

Another plus is that the mouse works wonderfully out of the box, is configured almost perfectly if macros are not needed - you can not install the software. <br><br>  <b>UPD3:</b> trial and error revealed that the mouse poorly digests sixty-four Windows 8 / 8.1.  On the seven and 32-bit everything is more or less plowing, but the second ‚Äúwheel‚Äù is still only wound up with a tambourine.

Where are we in 2014-2015 without achivok something. <br><br><h1>  Work on different surfaces </h1><br>  The mouse, of course, according to the ideas of the developers (all except <b>ASUS</b> ), lives in a spherical vacuum on an ideal surface.<font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In practice, everyone has different tables, everyone has different carpets, different materials. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The test took place on the following surfaces: a cheap chipboard table, covered with plastic ‚Äúveneer‚Äù, a glass table with a matte back surface (the mouse went over glossy), a black cover of a cheap system unit, a SteelSeries carpet, a MacBook cover, denim. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Evaluation of the ‚Äúomnivorousness of the mouse‚Äù is nowhere easier: the first number is 1 point for a partially working surface, 2 for a fully working one and without complaints. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The second number is 1 if the mouse moved effortlessly and slid well, 2 if the mouse moved without differences in effort from the carpet. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Thus, we will evaluate both the sensor and the material of the sliding surface of the legs, and it will be seen which of the mice is the most omnivorous.</font></font><br><br><table><tbody><tr><td>  Mouse <br></td><td>  Table <br></td><td>  Glass <br></td><td>  Housing <br></td><td><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font

And sitting in a photoshop, and playing at your leisure, and working with documents, and just using it is nice, but the Storm Reaper is more like a heavily charged civilian car, rather than a specially designed circuit race car, rally or nascar. <br><br>  <b>SteelSeries</b> clearly marks Razer in place: the new <b>universal</b> software, the quality of the mouse and the presence of a developed product line is an unequivocal hint that not everyone is satisfied with the ‚Äúroyal‚Äù position of black and green. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/398/a62/7ba/398a627ba8544607bfa55328b8d2c877.jpg"><br><br>  The attempt was definitely a success.  A mouse is worth every ruble that is asked for and is a direct materialization of the phrase ‚Äúthe best is the enemy of the good.‚Äù  There are no obvious disadvantages, a mountain of positive advantages, reasonable price and excellent quality.  One of the best universal gaming mice. <br><br>  <b><b>Mad Catz</b></b> , in fact, continues to release Cybog's RAT7 unchanged.  Excellent customizable "hardware" mouse, almost perfectly configured out of the box. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/531/faa/1a8/531faa1a8e524370840288cdef12a7d0.jpg"><br><br>  You can connect and use as is, forgetting about the macros, the second wheel and different profiles (mouse profiles, not DPI, the latter switches "swing" under the wheel, again, out of the box).  Do not want, do not like or do not know why all these settings, but like high-quality products and computer games?  RAT7 for you.  The perfect mouse for versatile work.  The price, however, is inadequate in some places with the current dollar rate, but at the same OZON you can buy it for quite adequate 5 thousand or a little less. <br><br>  <b><b>Roccat</b></b> created a monster.  The mouse deserves all praise, as well as software, but it requires exactly that ‚Äúzadrotsky‚Äù approach: setting all parameters for yourself, recording macros, reassigning all buttons ‚Äúas it will be convenient‚Äù, creating a thousand-and-one profile and skillfully applying this magnificence in battle . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/676/6c5/36a/6766c536afb74bf18f97d07fa218dc4f.jpg"><br><br>  Earn a living with games?  <b>Roccat</b> will help.  Do you like to tinker in the settings for hours?  That way.  Otherwise, you can buy two Gladius'a (one in each hand, provided that both are right) or some other mouse. <br><br>  I hope this material will help you not to be mistaken with the choice of a new rodent - not for one month, yet you are buying.  :) Once again with the upcoming, and your cursor in the heat of digital battles will not falter! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e3c/61d/f81/e3c61df81aff448d8d8170bffc372384.jpg"></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/375173/">https://habr.com/ru/post/375173/</a></p>
