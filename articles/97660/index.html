  <section class="page js-page"><h1>10 outstanding iPad apps that will shock you. (Part 1)</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/5ae/799/39f/5ae79939f05fb6e12bde364301f18317.jpg" alt="image"><br>  Since the release of Aipad, 3 months have not passed yet, but in such a short period of time programmers have already managed to ‚Äúnastrogate‚Äù 9000 applications for this trendy gadget.  But, as with the applications for iPhone, there is one problem - it is quite difficult to find really high-quality and interesting programs in the crowded App Store catalog. <br><br>  We were looking forward to some applications before the release of Aipad, this list was replenished after the device entered the market, after which we put together all the applications that seemed intriguing to us.  As we tested and dive into the world of Aipad applications, we were able to select some really beautiful software.  The list is quite varied: from a web browser that is better than the built-in Safari, to a musical notes reader that teaches playing the piano. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  Reeder </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/085/d5d/4c7/085d5d4c7262fe9ee7baa8ac6950f739.jpg" alt="image"><br>  The creators of this program borrowed the interface from the photo-viewing application built into Aypad, but we are sure that Steve Jobs is not against it.  Reeder makes reading news feeds damn pleasant - as long as the newspapers have not yet understood how to do it qualitatively.  This is one of those applications, using which you will understand why you bought your iPad. <br>  Reader shows all your RSS feeds in the form of albums, each stream has its own rectangular "cover".  Spread your fingers by touching one of them and you will see a list of titles on the left side of the page and the full text of the article on the right.  Putting three fingers together will close the open ribbon and return you to the main menu. <br>  The application will especially appeal to those who in their work have to read a lot of news feeds.  Reader definitely allows you to make reading tapes more enjoyable. <br><h6>  Price: $ 5 <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/reeder-for-ipad/id375661689%3Fmt%3D8">Download</a> </h6><br><br><h4>  Craigslist pro </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/097/3bf/3b3/0973bf3b3ef0219a5c518249cb98f365.jpg" alt="image"><br>  Craig Newman has not updated the appearance of his application since the last millennium, but this program for iPad has an updated appearance and allows you to make its use more convenient. <br>  Craigslist Pro allows you to automate a lot of tedious things that you have to face when you are looking for a new job, a motorcycle, where to spend the night, etc.  on craiglist.  (Global service of private announcements, a comment of the translator) <br>  Start by setting your current location, then selecting a category (for example, jobs, dating, or housing) and typing a keyword. <br>  The best part is that you can immediately see a preview for each ad below its name.  Thus, you can quickly navigate through the list of ads to easily view all the ads at once.  By clicking on the ad you can download the full text of the ad and pictures (if they are attached).  In the upper right corner there is a button ‚ÄúSave Search‚Äù in case you want to search for something by the specified parameters regularly. <br>  A great app for a superb, though outdated, web service. <br><h6>  Price: $ 1 <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/craigslist-pro-for-iphone/id310947683%3Fmt%3D8">Download</a> </h6>

    <h4>  Etude </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/e47/c00/65d/e47c0065df0f6a2ee2d8031054dd80b0.jpg" alt="image"><br>  Learning to play the piano has always been one of those things that all smart boys did under pressure from their parents, while ordinary guys played sports after school (SHOUTING).  But this app will help make a difference.  Etude displays the piano keyboard and plays notes in real time.  The main feature: the virtual keyboard at the bottom of the screen plays along with the song, highlighting the keys that are pressed in each moment, in order to teach you what position your hands should be on the piano keyboard.  In addition to the built-in, you can download additional scores and lessons. <br>  The application is universal and you can download and run it as on iPhone like Aipad, but better on the latter, since it reveals the potential of Aipad and can be used as a replacement for the music stand and even a live instructor. <br><h6>  Price: $ 5 <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/etude-sheet-music-on-steroids/id358352641%3Fmt%3D8">Download</a> </h6><br><br><h4>  Beejiveim </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/67c/52d/f20/67c52df205622e0b3d2d32677e3ad04f.jpg" alt="image"><br>  Apple‚Äôs FaceTime 4th generation iPhone technology may make video chats fashionable, but traditional chat rooms and messaging software are not yet about to give way.  BeeJiveIM was our favorite app on iPhone, and the new app for Aipad is just as beautiful.  It is equipped with a fine-tuned interface that turns messaging into fun ‚Äî even on devices without multitasking support.  The program has an extensive set of functions, such as: group chat, image sharing and audio chat. <br><h6>  Price: $ 10 <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/beejiveim-for-ipad/id372269251%3Fmt%3D8">Download</a> </h6><br><br><h4>  Comic Zeal Comic Reader </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/8e2/0a0/078/8e20a0078473da94e6a58d76cb3602d0.jpg" alt="image"><br>  The iPad's beautiful display makes reading digital copies of comics even more enjoyable than reading paper originals, and this application allows you to easily do this.  In it, you can open comic books, i.e.  literally, you can download comics (in .cbz or .cbr formats), from your computer to the application via Wi-Fi or via USB. <br>  Some people use this application to read free comics with free distribution, while others can use it to play pirated copies.  Regardless, Comic Zeal Comic Reader gives you the freedom to read any comics you want on your iPad, without being tied to a particular universe, as in specialized Marvel or DC Comics apps.  The application looks very stylish and very easy to understand.  It's nice that if you close the app, and then start it again, you can resume reading from the place where you stopped last time. <br><h6>  Price: $ 8 <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/comic-zeal-comic-reader-4/id363990983%3Fmt%3D8">Download</a> </h6><br><br>  PS The following 5 applications in the second part of the article. <br>  See <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/iTablet/97671/">here</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/97660/">https://habr.com/ru/post/97660/</a></p>
