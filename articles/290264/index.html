There is even a completely harmless term - redirection.  Therefore, many support service employees, with relief and not without pleasure, inform customers that ‚Äúthe solution of such issues is not within their competence.‚Äù <br><br>  However, there is a problem.  Few people like this approach.  And this is quite fair, because the client does not know and should not know your "kitchen".  He gets on the employee who represents the whole company for him.  Accordingly, when a client addresses a problem, regardless of what you usually do, <b>responsibility becomes yours</b> . <a name="habracut"></a>
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>

      You must make every effort to solve the problem or ‚Äúhold the client by the hand‚Äù to the best specialists and make sure that he is satisfied with everything.  Otherwise, you make it clear that the internal structure of the company is of much greater importance than the problems of the client. <br><br><h4>  Is it always appropriate to have such a serious attitude? </h4><br>  For example, when asked about payment for services, the same developer will hardly answer anything other than ‚Äúthis is not for me‚Äù.  That's right, situations are different.  Often, clients themselves understand that every employee of a company cannot understand everything.  Nevertheless, the sediment remains: they did not help, did not do anything special, but only followed the rules. <br><br>  In this regard, a great example to follow is the seller.  He rarely gives up and does the impossible to achieve results.  When another deal comes on, and the client asks for something that the seller himself cannot do, the latter begins to "pull" everyone, from the cleaning lady to the director, to do everything in the best possible way. <br><br>  Of course, sellers are personally interested in customer satisfaction, as they receive a percentage.  In contrast, support staff do not directly sell products or services.  <i>However, the company's profits are highly dependent on how well they cope with their responsibilities</i> . <br><br>  Let's look at three examples.  In each of them, the client addresses questions that are not exactly addressed. <br><br>  <b>Example ‚Ññ1</b> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/98e/a81/c74/98ea81c7443c42989905692e949abd58.png"><br>  The usual reply, the purpose of which is to declare that "we are not to blame for anything."  In this case, the client was not looking for the perpetrators, but a solution. <br><br>  Such answers are dangerous because the client gets an additional problem in your face.  Not only that the issue is not solved, so you still show indifference.  Whatever happens, you must always be in the "team" of the client - to deal with the problem.  If you become a part of the problem, the result is only one - customer frustration. <br><br>  <i>How should answer?</i> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/26a/628/c73/26a628c7396042a7a69c5a69fa52057f.png"><br><br>  <b>Example 2</b> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/4f9/b88/32d/4f9b8832dcd9425aa1e5b945fcad4381.png"><br>  The redirection is not a help, but the least that the customer doesn‚Äôt even thank. <br><br>  An employee must do more than is expected of him.  Additional efforts are very important in building relationships with customers.  First, do everything possible and only after that pass responsibility, if you can not do without it. <br><br>  <i>How should answer?</i> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/4d1/dfa/5ea/4d1dfa5eaf9c47af9f7cd192e67efe41.png"><br><br>  <b>Example number 3</b> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/6b3/0ab/da5/6b30abda5a5a4f56a0be59be134bd1e9.png"><br>  The answer is quite acceptable, but it lacks a clear desire to help.  If it is possible to simplify / speed up the process, the employee must use it. <br><br>  <i>How should answer?</i> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ad2/5b7/f34/ad25b7f3452f4b79adfa8593299c3ebf.png"><br><br>  <b>‚ÄúAnswers in half‚Äù, slowly but surely, form not the most pleasant opinion about the support service and the company as a whole</b> .  The first time the client will not pay attention to this, the second time his mood will deteriorate, the third time - he will tell his friends that you are pretending rather than working.  It will only get worse in the future - up to the rejection of your services. <br><br><h4>  Let's sum up </h4><br>  <b>1)</b> Every company employee should do the maximum to help the client.  The structure of the company can not serve as an excuse for shifting responsibility to each other. <br><br>  <b>2)</b> The only correct answer to the client‚Äôs problem is ‚ÄúI will help you.‚Äù  Does this approach require more staff time?  Of course, but alternative options lead to much more sad consequences. <br><br>  <b>3)</b> Give your employees more freedom of action when communicating with customers.  Often, strict instructions from the management turn an employee into a robot and prevent him from doing the main thing - to help the client. <br><br>  <b>4)</b> The task of the employee is to always be an ally in solving the problem.  When an employee becomes an additional headache for a client, there is no going back. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/290264/">https://habr.com/ru/post/290264/</a></p>
