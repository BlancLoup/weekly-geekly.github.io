  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Court and EMS</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  An ebay forum user sued EMS. <br>  How did it end? <br><blockquote>  Then the judge went out for 2 seconds, then returned and read out the decision - ‚ÄúThe decision of the previous judge to stand, to refuse the lawsuit.‚Äù <br>  Finita la comedy.  According to the representative, this is judicial arbitrariness - you can file an appeal in the form of supervision or something like that, but the chance tends to zero.  Since I have no more money left - I decided to stop the business. <br><br>  Total during the trial: <br>  1. I lost as a result of EMC PR actions and illegal actions of courts, including indirect costs not reflected in the lawsuit - about 70 thousand rubles.  To cover these expenses and prevent their impact on the family, I had to sell <a name="habracut"></a>  the car.  By the way, now the tax has sent me a letter about this and requires filling out a declaration for the incomes received as a result of the sale of the car and paying the tax (at least in some ways our state works clearly - I am looking for the last contract I bought the car all over the apartment to show that sold cheaper than bought and did not receive income).  Just about three weeks of life was lost on trampling on ships that no one would return to me. <br>  2. I realized that even if you are ironically right, all the evidence is on your side, but the state corporation has driven you - in most cases you don‚Äôt have anything good to do (no precedent is needed).  For "the crow does not peck out the crow."  I don‚Äôt even mention the solidarity of the judges with each other. <br>  3. If you are not engaged in a black business and are not ready to cover theft, putting it into profit, then buying running gears (those that are easy to sell) goods abroad, although it looks tempting due to their low price, but with a single purchase for yourself or working together with friends to reduce the cost of delivery (my case) - does not even turn into a lottery (in which a win is still possible), but into a banal scam, where, at best, if you blow or if you take all the precautions, you can stay with your having lost a few weeks time and  bundle nervously.  At worst - without money, things and nerves. <br>  4. If you still want to buy something from undercarriage electronics or other expensive things abroad (I will note - to save, because we have the same thing in two, or even three times more), then it is worth doing only using the delivery of his friend who went on a business trip or on vacation abroad (although there is still a chance that they will steal from the baggage on the plane).  Either transferring the risks and subsequent problems beyond our country to where the law is in effect - that is, transfer the problems to a foreign counterparty (refund of a dispute to the PayPal after refusing to receive a stolen parcel, with the corresponding subsequent attitude of foreigners to Russia - 80% of foreigners as private owners and shops have already deleted Russia from the list of countries with which they are ready to deal). </blockquote><br><br>  All from the very beginning, read here: <a href="http://www.ebay-forum.ru/phpBB2/topic79374s60.html">Ebay-forum</a> </div>
