  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Why does the Central Bank develop a bill to regulate the market for P2P-lending and crowd-investing?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  According to the Central Bank, the volume of the p2p lending and crowdinvesting market in Russia has grown significantly and needs to be regulated.  This will reduce the risks that customers of such sites are exposed to today - both investors and borrowers, the Central Bank believes. <br><br>  Mikhail Mamut, the Head of the Main Directorate for Microfinance Market and the Central Bank's Financial Availability Methodology, expects the project to be considered next year. <br><br>  The development of a regulatory model will be based on an analysis of international experience - primarily those jurisdictions in which these markets are developing rapidly (England, USA, China), sources told Kommersant. <a name="habracut"></a><br><blockquote>  P2P is lending to some individuals by other individuals through special sites that act as intermediaries.  Through crowdinvesting platforms, citizens have the opportunity to invest in any projects, receive a share in the project, part of the finished product, and so on. </blockquote><br>  From 2015, the Central Bank began collecting data from major market participants on a voluntary basis.

      According to the Central Bank, by the end of 2015, the total volume of the loan portfolio in these markets amounted to 170 million rubles.  According to the results of the first nine months of 2015, the Central Bank estimated the volume of this portfolio at the level of 100 million rubles.  This growth in portfolio volumes in the fourth quarter is caused not so much by the growth of the market, but by the number of sites that took part in voluntary monitoring. <br><br>  When preparing the draft law, it is planned to determine the requirements for the sites themselves, the principles of business organization, the protection of investors' rights, business continuity, guarantees for investors and borrowers, reporting, risk management systems, counteracting unfair practices, explained in the Central Bank. <br><br>  According to Mikhail Mamuty, today people who borrow money on p2p platforms are not protected by consumer credit, because the p2p platform does not have a special status. <br><br>  ‚ÄúThey are in unequal rights compared to borrowers of banks or MFIs,‚Äù he notes. ‚ÄúIn turn, people who invest their money through such sites are also not protected, and the sites themselves are not liable to their customers.‚Äù <br><br>  ‚ÄúOne of the most acute problems in the p2p lending market is identification,‚Äù Anton Tarasov, head of the Vdolg.ru p2p platform, <a href="http://www.kommersant.ru/doc/2966717">told</a> Kommersant. ‚ÄúFraudsters use someone else‚Äôs passport data and someone else‚Äôs TIN, and the site due to the lack of access to According to the Pension Fund and the Federal Tax Service will not be able to verify this. " <br><br>  If the sites begin to regulate the Central Bank, they will receive an official status and will be able to request state agencies about the compliance of the data transmitted by the client and the data held by government agencies, Mr. Tarasov hopes. <br><br>  At crowdfunding platforms, the main risks are the lack of qualifications among investors, said the head of the Boomstarter site, Ruslan Tugushev.  In such a situation, the Central Bank, for example, can establish requirements for investors, the expert adds. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/300194/">https://habr.com/ru/post/300194/</a></p>
