To say that we enjoyed the process - to say nothing.  With the help of sales of this circulation, we were unable to even recoup the seal, but it is impossible to transfer the state of satisfaction from the benefits brought.  The most pleasant thing was to receive feedback from grateful and happy parents who bought this book. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  I have long wanted to do something similar: a project that will benefit people, and creators - pleasure.  And last year I was lucky to get into a startup (although this word already sounds like a curse) Event Finder.  I want to attract new participants to the project and attention in general, and here I will tell about my experience of participation in it and about the results.

      <b>about the project</b> <br>  Idea - we create a resource about cultural events that are looking for sponsors and partners. <br><br>  Our idea is somewhat similar to <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/">http://www.kickstarter.com/</a> .  But we did not take the liberty to develop such a large project, but decided to limit ourselves - based on our capabilities and abilities. <br><br>  Now our project looks something like this: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/7bd/545/a03/7bd545a031c4c79aae9bfdf6249b9abb.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  And we plan to look like this: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/810/9f1/826/8109f1826f431ac6f003bbd67fd7a60f.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  At the beginnings - three people. <br>  This is me (http://www.facebook.com/kaise.nobel), Nikolay Bulanov (http://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=1375590707&amp;sk=info) and Oleg Nikolaev (http: // www .facebook.com / bojinda? sk = info). <br>  We have known Oleg for three years now, and I learned Kohl when we began to discuss working together. <br><br>  And this is the main page: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/640/d76/a91/640d76a9124b4f1078702f6ea29f8f3a.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  At first we were called ‚ÄúRussian Renaissance‚Äù, but then we were told that with this name we look like neo-Nazis, and we became the Event Finder.  With this name, our political views just will not crack. <br><br>  Galina Belkova (Zueva) was very helpful in working on the content part of the project. <br><br>  <b>Who needs it</b> <br>  Among our friends there are many artists, fashion designers, musicians and other creative people.  Most of them are constantly worn with ideas to create an event, an event where they can express themselves, and then give their colleagues to express themselves. <br><br>  So, our audience is those who create events / events, and those who are looking for them. <br><br>  Events are created by various PR agencies, event-agencies, artists, musicians, producers.  These people and organizations may not have much, but enough to fill Moscow with interesting cultural events. <br><br>  Those who are looking for events are mostly brand managers, PR managers, marketing directors of large companies.  Companies with an active position, good advertising budgets and a desire to be on the ear. <br><br>  For example, the illustrator Masha wants to open a gallery of her illustrations.  She already has an agreement with the site where this all goes.  There is the theme of the exhibition ‚ÄúCybernetic future and nanorobots‚Äù and there are people who will come to the event with pleasure.  And the company Yota, for example, has a desire to be innovative, creative and focused on young people and other hipsters.  Masha and Yota are perfect for each other.  But they would never have met if it were not for the Event Finder. <br><br>  <b>Motivation</b> <br>  There is a reasonable question: "Why does my armpit itch?" Ugh.  Not this one.  This is from another startup.  A reasonable question - WHY? <br><br>  We want to do a good and useful thing.  We are pleased that we can make the necessary project for society, which helps ideas to find money for implementation. <br><br>  <b>Mission</b> <br>  Our mission is to develop the cultural life of Russia and support talented people on the path of creative creation. <br><br>  <b>Targets and goals</b> <br>  Our goal is to make a convenient resource for presenting ideas.  And we want to create a bridge between the people who organize events and those who need a presence at such events. <br><br>  It is important to make sure that the event organizers have a tool in their hands. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/8ca/1cd/e67/8ca1cde67f0a22460bc81f0a60fc726c.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  For these purposes, we decided to make a website.  Class? <br><br>  For example, on the site, in our opinion, everything should be in order to describe your event with dignity and in detail.  And we came up with a configurator. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/368/0aa/33d/3680aa33da9f07d99e1f3fc807fd1649.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>Monetization</b> <br>  Now the site is created on personal funds, and we would not refuse income.  But the goal is to make the site profitable now. <br><br>  We were advised by several monetization systems. <br><br>  Make the site closed, with access by subscription.  That is, companies pay to access the site.  We believe that this is a barrier.  And then we will not reach our goal. <br><br>  Earn on banner advertising.  Unfortunately, our project is designed for a very narrow audience, and we assume that the attendance of the resource will be no more than 20,000 - 50,000 people per month. <br><br>  Earn interest on sponsored packages.  This is interesting, but we are unlikely to find a mechanism for honestly receiving this money. <br><br>  So far this is all that has occurred to us. <br><br>  <b>Design</b> <br>  We are really lucky with the designer.  This is Valera Fironov.  One of the best art directors in Russia.  <a href="http://www.firon.ru/">www.firon.ru</a> <br><br>  Before the meeting with Valera, we did a little research and picked up projects that we ideologically and stylistically like.  One example was <a href="http://www.latimes.com/">www.latimes.com.</a> <br><br>  To present the project, we first painted the layouts on paper for a long time.  But as designers, we are frankly none, we decided on prototypes in the iPlotz program.  This is what we gave to Valera: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/7e7/72b/724/7e772b72450bfd0f01903c03817f1d1d.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Thanks to Valera‚Äôs efforts, our site has found its face.  We really like his visual expression and style. <br><br>  The logo was worked on by the Red Keds design team.  The final project logo was drawn by Oleg Peters ( <a href="http://yarvu.livejournal.com/">http://yarvu.livejournal.com/</a> ). <br><br>  <b>Team</b> <br>  Oleg Nikolaev, Nikolay Bulanov, Valera Fironov, Ira and Sira, Stas Polyakov (art director of Red Keds, participated in the development of the logo), Alexey Kozhevnikov (designer of the logo version), Andrei Melnikov (designer of the logo ). <br><br>  The site is developed by the Novosibirsk company <a href="http://wow.wearewowagency.com/">http://wow.wearewowagency.com/</a> <br><br>  <b>What we lack</b> <br>  Well, for the start of the money.  Then alcohol.  Then women. <br><br>  There are still not enough people who understand the events.  Which "cook" in this topic and can attract the organizers of interesting events to our site. <br><br>  We need people who know how to meet and find new contacts on absolutely any topic. <br><br>  We need people who will take over the technical support of the project.  Will monitor the performance of the site, impose new pages, make design, fix bugs. <br><br>  In the future, I am ready to talk about the project, how and what we did. <br>  I am also ready to answer all the questions about the progress of the project and the problems we faced. <br><br>  In the meantime, you all can quickly subscribe to the opening of the site <a href="http://www.eventfinder.ru/">www.eventfinder.ru</a> <br><br>  If you have any questions, please email me at kaise.nobel@gmail.com </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/117937/">https://habr.com/ru/post/117937/</a></p>
