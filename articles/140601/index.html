What are hell they talking about?  And the Indian toad is expressed more clearly. ‚Äù  It turned out that the Russian language is not so powerful, and the main business community speaks with a large number of Anglo-calves and specific terms.  Many people joke that they have already forgotten the Russian language, but have not yet learned English.  Most of the terms really have no direct analogs, and for people who have lived for a long time in the United States, in fact, it is difficult to find suitable Russian equivalents.

    <h3>  <i><b>Entrepreneur, Startupper, Founder and Co-founder</b></i> </h3><br>  If you have opened a tent with a shawarma, then you are an <i>entrepreneur</i> (fr. Entrepreneur is an entrepreneur).  Despite the fact that a start-up (from the English start-up-start) is absolutely any company with a short history of operating activities, under startups, both here and in them, it is customary to imply new projects in high-tech industries (high- tech).  By and large, every start-up is an entrepreneur, but not every entrepreneur is a start-up.  The person who founded any company is a <i>founder</i> .  The people who join (join) to the fighter at very early stages are <i>co</i> - <i>founders</i> . <br><br><h3>  <i><b>Startup Weekend, Meetups, an Elevator Pitch, Challenge, Networking and Hardworking</b></i> </h3><br>  Habitat professional startups are numerous startup weekends, informal parties and mitapy.  On weekends, startups, with a mandatory fire in their eyes, should produce an <i>elevator pitch</i> (from the English <i>Elevator Pitch</i> - presentation in an elevator).  Since our schools believe that taking the double integral in life helps a lot more than the ability to conduct presentations, the Elevator Peach is a serious <i>challenge</i> (challenge, challenge, problem).  The rest of the people go to parties to do <i>networking</i> (networking).  The poor think <i>networking</i> is more important than <i>hardworking</i> . <br><blockquote>  <i>- How did you get to work with such an IQ as a programmer?</i>  <i>Probably a crap?</i> <i><br></i>  <i>- What a crap?</i>  <i>Sestla!</i> </blockquote><br><h3>  <i><b>Viral Marketing, Self Promotion, Naming, Scalability and Monetization</b></i> </h3><br>  In the course of the pitch, which goes from 30 seconds to 2 minutes, the author of the project should do a small self-promotion and show why his project will change the world. <br>  It is highly desirable that your bedroom (amer .; colloquially <i>cute</i> - elegant, attractive) project be: <br>  <b>Viral.</b>  Viral is when elderly women at the Komarovsky Market tell about your project to each other. <br>  Scalable (eng. Scalability) - means the ability of the system to cope with the increase in workload (to increase its productivity).  In other words, the cost of producing each successive dollar should be reduced. <br>  <b>Monetizable</b>  Monetization is the process of exchanging the good feelings that you invest in a project, with banal money. <br>  <b>Mobile.</b>  If you are developing skis-walkers, then they must be accessible from a mobile device.  Go mobile or die! <br><br><h3>  <i><b>Facilitator</b></i> </h3><br>  A person who keeps track of the event's regulations (someone who manages, leads, moderates the event) and maintains positive group dynamics is called a facilitator ( <i>English facilitator, from Lat. Facilis - ‚Äúeasy, comfortable‚Äù</i> ).  In the West, you can even get a special certificate and then earn money on this by participating in large business negotiations (for completely losers). <br><br><h3>  <i><b>Startup Lynch, Pros and Cons, Gap, Decision making and Bozo</b></i> </h3><br>  At a lynch startup <i>(lynching, eng. Lynching, the Lynch law</i> ) there is a discussion of the projects, all pros and cons are weighed. <br>  As in any discussion of smart men, every inch counts.  Therefore, a person who realizes himself only in local markets will say that you have scalability problems.  Lawyer - that you have a poorly structured formal questions.  A professional consultant, in order to justify the cost of obtaining an MBA in a decent business school, will talk about <i>Return of Investment (ROI)</i> , <i>Cash Flow</i> and other obscure words and business algorithms. <br>  And there are plenty of bad people who will say that it will not work for you and that it will not work.  Guy Kawasaki calls such people Bozo (stupid, idiot) and divides them into two categories: <br>  <i>safe Bozo</i> is just a loser, a man who costs nothing in this life, but will say time after time that nothing will come of it.  You look at him and think: ‚Äúwhy should I believe you, you are a loser‚Äù. <br>  <i>the dangerous kind of bozo</i> is a taut man in black, driving an expensive German car.  He has already achieved success, however, in ways and opportunities that are probably already outdated and will not work for you.  When such a Bozo says that ‚Äúyou cannot succeed,‚Äù ‚Äúyou cannot succeed,‚Äù ‚Äúnobody needs it,‚Äù you may be tempted to believe him. <br>  Bozo will be happy if his predictions come true and you still fail (and you, of course, fail a couple of times), and will be upset if you succeed.  They love to write boring texts and make presentations with the main message, why they have failed and failed.  Bozo is not our bro. <br><br><h2>  <i>My first company failed with a big bang.</i>  <i>The second was less unsuccessful, but still failed.</i>  <i>The third company also failed, but overall it was OK.</i>  <i>But I quickly moved away from these failures.</i>  <i>My fourth was on the verge of failure, and the fifth was PayPal.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>- Max Levchin (Co-founder, PayPal)</i> <i><br></i> </h2><br><h3>  <b><i>IT Evangelist and SMM</i></b> </h3><br>  IT evangelist is an expert who is professionally engaged in propaganda (usually through SMM - social media marketing) in the field of information technology.  The term was first used by Michael Murray to promote the Macintosh.  Therefore, apparently, they say that <s>Agile</s> Apple is a religion.  Since no one likes sales (sales), the first salespeople in a startup are sometimes called evangelicals. <br><br><h3>  <i><b>Mentor and Smart Money</b></i> </h3><br>  Mentor (ancient Greek ŒúŒ≠ŒΩœÑœâœÅ) - once a character of ancient Greek mythology, now we call our mentor and advisor.  According to his needs, he is usually located at the highest point of Maslow's pyramid and is self-fulfilling by mentoring young people.  He / She does not hesitate to advertise his own mistakes and can help with advice, connections, resources and give some smart money for 2% of the company or for free.  Mentor is our bro. <br><br><h3>  <b><i>Advisor, geolocation and integration</i></b> </h3><br>  You can‚Äôt do sekas on October Square, because a lot of <i>advisors</i> will advise you how to scale this activity, tie up geolocation and add integration with facebook and linkedin.  Usually this all prevents you from devoting yourself to the core business. <br><br><h3>  <i><b>Business Angel, Venture capitalists, Seed Capital, Business Accelerator and Crowd Funding</b></i> </h3><br>  The main difference between <i>Business Angel</i> and <i>Venture Capitalist</i> is that Business Angel, as a rule, risks its own money. <br>  <i>Business Accelerator</i> differs from the <i>Investment Fund</i> in that Accelerator provides, in addition to money and project promotion, a complete infrastructure (a room with delicious coffee, buns and ottomans).  In other words, it takes startups to its farm and feeds acorns for the purpose of resale. <br><br>  The classic financing cycle looks like this: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/392/c7f/3c7/392c7f3c7b258a177c78b455c74621c1.png" alt="image"><br><br>  <i><b>FFF</b> or <b>3F</b></i> are <i>Friends, Family and Fools</i> .  Friends, family and idiots who believed you. <br><br>  <b><i>Valley of Death (Valley of Death)</i></b> is if, despite all the warnings, you still started the project, but the rolltons have nothing to buy. <br><br>  Stage after receiving the 3rd round of investment before the IPO is called mezzanine.  Mezzanine ( <i>Italian.</i> Mezzanino <i>- "intermediate"</i> ) - superstructure, tower, half-tier, half-dwelling - the term went from architectural mockery.  Just In Case: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e13/751/a50/e13751a5041b4bab4e1122b30ecb9774.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Do not confuse <i><b>Revenue</b></i> (turnover, sales volume) and <i><b>Income</b></i> ( <b><i>profit</i></b> , income).  Haueva, the main money is now being earned on resale, and usually a startup doesn‚Äôt care if he has a profit or not, if only the development dynamics are positive. <br><br>  <b>Seed money</b> is seed money.  It is believed that it is necessary to sow very plentifully, since everything grows very bad on the startup market, but if something comes up, it will justify the whole sowing campaign.  If you are a very poor two-time loser and you don‚Äôt even have money for a prototype, you may be given a little pre-seed money. <br><br>  If you and your friends decided to throw off and invest your miserable belongings in some kind of project - it will be <b><i>crowdfunding</i></b> (popular funding, from English <i>crowd funding</i> , crowd - ‚Äúcrowd‚Äù, <i>funding</i> - ‚Äúfunding‚Äù). <br><br><h3>  <i><b>Bootstrapping</b></i> </h3><br>  If you do not want to share a share, or just no one has given you money, then you are walking bootstrapping (literally - tightening the straps on the shoes, tightening the belts).  If you take money from the bank for your project, it will be bootstrapping too. <br><br><h3>  <i><b>Stocks, Upside and Downside</b></i> </h3><br>  Usually, start-ups are trying to attract Rock Stars to their team by offering options (stocks). <br><br><h2>  <i>Graffiti artist David Cho painted the walls of Facebook‚Äôs first headquarters in 2005.</i>  <i>Mark Zuckerberg offered him either a few thousand dollars, or company shares for the same amount in payment for work.</i>  <i>David took the stock.</i>  <i>And if the value of Facebook as a result of an IPO is estimated at $ 100 billion, the cost of the artist‚Äôs shares will increase to $ 200 million, calculated in the newspaper New Your Times.</i> <i><br></i> </h2><br>  Those who bought EPAM shares at $ 14 in the <b>upside</b> ( <i>English sided</i> - 1. expectation of growth in stock quotes; 2. the positive side of the phenomenon), also did not lose. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/dee/564/b4c/dee564b4c100a692d69b44710dde7b01.png" alt="image"><br>  (The fact that most of our colleagues cannot officially buy shares in the company in which they work, we will try not to comment). <br><br><h3>  <b><i>A new management speak buzz word - "Pivot"</i></b> </h3><br>  Jim Collins in the book ‚ÄúFrom Good to Great‚Äù (2001) divides companies into ‚Äúhedgehogs‚Äù and ‚Äúfoxes‚Äù, relying on an ancient Greek parable: the fox knows many different things, the hedgehog knows one thing, but very important.  It is believed that great companies should have the concept of a hedgehog and go in the chosen direction without exchanging small things. <br><br>  But in such great companies as Kodak and RIM (BlackBerry), there were people who, instead of nerves, had steel ropes, and they could not catch the changes in the industry, which led to dire consequences.  Therefore, Eric Raise in ‚ÄúThe Lean Startup‚Äù (2011, the book was translated as ‚ÄúA Thrifty Startup‚Äù) promotes such an idea as to Pivot.  To Pivot - is to change the direction (change direction) of the company by evolution, using past experience, instead of making a revolution. <br>  If the Project Manager, looking at the Gantt Chart, decides that Seniour Java Developer on Tuesday will ship the bricks, because JamShooting.ru had good rates - this will not be to Pivot.  When Apple decided to choose the new core of the iPhone, using its work in the iPod, it was to Pivot. <br>  Also a good example was PayPal‚Äôs decision to focus on one of its product features ‚Äî payments ‚Äî instead of a complex PDA-based cryptography solution. <br><br><h2>  <i>By the time of our first board of directors, i.e.</i>  <i>about a month later, we already understood that our idea would not work ... We began the meeting by saying ‚ÄúHello, John.</i>  <i>Hi, Pete (these are our investors).</i>  <i>We changed the business plan. ‚Äù</i>  <i>Their answer: ‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù They just posted $ 4 million to see some kind of result, and we tell them: ‚ÄúSorry, but we are not going to do that, we will now do it.‚Äù</i> <i><br></i>  <i>- Max Levchin (Co-founder, PayPal)</i> </h2><br><br>  <i><b>To pivot or not to pivot</b></i> is still a philosophical question. <br><br><h1>  <b>... and so on and so forth.</b> <b><br><br></b>  <b>See you later, alligator!</b> </h1><br>  <b>Thanks</b> to Mikita Mikado, Vitaly Bahachuk, Bulat Lambaed and Michael Dubakov </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/140601/">https://habr.com/ru/post/140601/</a></p>
