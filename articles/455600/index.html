Existing transportation problems are no longer possible to solve in traditional ways. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Belarusian engineer and inventor Anatoly Yunitsky has offered the residents of megalopolises and their suburbs a completely new way to increase mobility without disrupting their habitual lifestyle and with minimal environmental consequences. <br><br>  ‚ÄúWhen I was young, I admired the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãspace travel, but I soon realized that first we needed to fix the infrastructure on our planet and solve transport problems,‚Äù says Unitsky.  ‚ÄúUnlike Henry Ford, who dreamed of the world being surrounded by highways, I want safe, economical and eco-friendly flyover string roads for intracity, suburban and intercity transportation on all continents.  That is why in 2014 we created SkyWay Technologies Co. ‚Äù.

    <img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/sz/q9/_9/szq9_9lhp_qascnbvncu8g-ns2i.jpeg" alt="image"><br><br>  The development of SkyWay transport systems involves a lot of specialists of various profiles, who are simultaneously participating in the creation of the final product.  Formerly SkyWay Technologies Co.  used different, unrelated software products for the design, engineering and manufacture of various systems and components.  It was practically impossible to exchange data promptly. <br><br>  In order for all activities to take place in a single environment, SkyWay switched to the <a href="https://www.3ds.com/ru/o-3ds/platforma-3dexperience/"><b>3D</b> EXPERIENCE</a> platform from Dassault Syst√®mes.  This helps to cope with all the difficulties associated with the design of complex structures and devices. <br><br>  Today, over 200 company employees work on this software platform. They are responsible for different components - design, hydraulics, pneumatics, chassis, air conditioning, supporting structures, electrical equipment, electronics, etc. <br><br>  We have to embed a lot of information flows into a single system, to unite different specialists, who usually do not communicate with each other.  By improving collaboration at SkyWay Technologies Co.  Began to make informed decisions faster. <br><br>  SkyWay uses CATIA Systems Engineering to eliminate conflicts and errors in the interaction of various components of the transport system.  Due to the transition to a unified platform, engineers can see the actions of their colleagues-subcontractors, monitor the docking of components and quickly perform their own tasks, taking into account the existing limitations. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/s7/7b/jx/s77bjxjxrrsasrmcmg7-ghds-8u.jpeg" alt="image"><br><br>  ‚ÄúThe possibility of digital layout of the entire transport system, rolling stock, infrastructure of the roads and the control system in a single environment is a huge plus,‚Äù says Alexey Voilenko, director of organizational development at SkyWay Technologies Co. <br><br>  - It is not so easy to integrate dimensional tolerances for technical design and construction-related parameters into a project.  This is what makes the production and construction of an integrated transport system a truly challenging task.  <a href="https://www.3ds.com/ru/o-3ds/platforma-3dexperience/"><b>3D</b> EXPERIENCE</a> allows all professionals to easily combine different technical standards and concepts. ‚Äù <br><br>  Digital modeling plays a huge role in determining the right approach to production.  In the simulation mode on the <b>3D</b> EXPERIENCE platform, specialists make serious calculations, and use the DELMIA module to control production operations.  Technological process before its physical embodiment is virtually tested.  This helps in advance to find the optimal approach to production.  If changes are made to the project, the production data is automatically updated, since on the <a href="https://www.3ds.com/ru/o-3ds/platforma-3dexperience/"><b>3D</b> EXPERIENCE</a> platform, the design and production data are closely related.  As a result, production efficiency significantly increases. <br><br>  ‚ÄúBillions of tons of fuel are burned in cars, which causes problems with the environment: destruction of the ozone layer, the greenhouse effect,‚Äù Yunitsky emphasizes.  ‚ÄúCombined with factors such as safety of people, population growth and an increase in the number of private cars, this prompted us to develop a new paradigm in the form of transport, deprived of all the above disadvantages.  In the major world capitals, building our string roads will help people spend three times less time on trips.  I believe in the success of the project, because we are creating the perfect transport, and we are already showing it at EcoTechnoPark in Maryina Gorka (approximately 63 km south-east of Minsk).  It built four test sites that meet the most stringent requirements.  To date, four rolling stock models have already been certified in Belarus. ‚Äù <br><br>  Learn more about how Dassault Systemes helps SkyWay Technologies Co.
