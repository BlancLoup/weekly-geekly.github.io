But not simple, but such that both were of good quality, and were agreeable, and got on with the layout, but were agreeable in terms of visiting the office.  The problem was solved by viral head-hunting: the text placed in the LJ and the link sent to ICQ. <br><br>  Now in our company there is an excellent designer paired with an excellent programmer.  I will talk about how beautiful they are later, but for now - text-virus or ‚ÄúHow to catch a hare?  ‚ÄúHide behind a tree and scream carrots!‚Äù <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>  <strong>‚ÄúWe need your brain‚Äù or a designer and programmer for the web are required in St. Petersburg!</strong>

      We need your brain.  And better two.  Wholesale only more expensive. <br><br>  Need a web designer.  Not just needed, but very necessary.  And not just a designer, but a good designer.  And ... and just web - just draw pages, nothing more.  But very designer.  You can not very creative, but very beautiful, petty, detailed and usable.  It is very necessary. <br><br>  Still need a web programmer.  And not just needed, but as a designer, really needed.  To implement what the designer drew.  Otherwise, it will be lonely.  And we will be lonely without a programmer.  We will yearn for it.  And the designer will wither and die. <br><br>  The programmer needs a smart one.  So that he knew that now cool.  And also hard-working.  So that I cry with envy, writing out to him and the designer of the award.  And also, so that I am ashamed to come to work in the morning and see him already behind the workplace.  And was touched by looking at the sleeping next to the designer.  And he went to write a premium, make coffee, light a cigarette.  And rock the designer in the chair. <br><br>  If any of them lives in the Komendantsky Ave. or Pionerskaya metro area, we will take them to work in the center by car.  In the evenings we will bring home and call the elevator.  And on the way, call your wife or husband and explain why the designer or programmer was delayed.  If the designer and programmer will be husband and wife, or vice versa - well.  If just friends - too.  We need friends.  But even more necessary - executive professionals who know the business.  We tried to just be friends - best of all it turns out with professionals.  Even better with executive professionals.  For no professionalism does not cover the deadlines.  Not to mention the money not received from the customer.  But the project handed over ahead of time easily covers the cost of coffee, delivery of lunch to the office.  Frees up a couple of days to rest.  Not in the Canaries.  We do not have a corporate dacha there.  Until. <br><br>  While we have no problem on the Canaries and the designer with the programmer, we miss.  We work for them and get their salary.  And cry.  We are tired of wearing it home.  She is big.  She's a lot.  She is good.  But I want to give it to the designer.  For beautiful designs.  For understanding eyes when talking about usability.  For the phrase ‚ÄúI somehow made one large portal ...‚Äù and ‚Äúthe layout there is so-so, I would do better ...‚Äù But simply because he is such a cool, our favorite designer.  What he works with us.  And a programmer.  That he is with us too.  He may not even say anything, just hmku the word "layout".  Indulgently so.  Or then to say: ‚ÄúI remember how we generated PHP for each browser in childhood‚Äù or ‚Äúin those pre-DJax times when XHTML and XML were SGML subsets, and not lines in the summary ...‚Äù And tell this, and then requests in the form of SQL queries were satisfied on the spot.  And so we would cry like samurai over hockey from the beauty of his code.  For now we just cry looking at empty jobs.  On the cozy chair.  On wide monitors.  Powerful computers.  If it were my will, I would do an online broadcast of these jobs on a porn resource.  And he sold pictures of the workplace: that is how the chair swings ... but how can you place everything on the desktop ... And this gentle mouse ... They all say, they scream - "Come to us!"  Come to us, O designer!  We want you!  We want to serve you, programmer! ‚ÄùWe are waiting for you!  We already love you!  Write!  We miss you!  Write me on amolok + job on gmail.com Write me in ICQ (195616744), call Skype (amrokdarok), leave a message in Google Talk!  We need your brain! <br><br>  The conditions are simple: for 60 thousand rubles a month a designer with a portfolio, untouched by the rays of diarrhea, if he knows how to live the icons - absolutely vyshak.  For 30 thousand rubles (or more - for an interview and for the early delivery of projects) per month a programmer with knowledge of PHP, JS (AJaX), XHTML, CSS, MySQL or Postgre.  An office in the center of St. Petersburg, on Gorokhovaya (not far from the metro station Pushkinskaya or Sennaya), salary twice a month.  We love you. <br><br>  (All repost, links, quotes are welcome. Everything so that we find each other.) <br><br>  - <br><br>  Project: <a href="http://videozz.ru/">videozz.ru</a> <br>  Next post: <a href="http://amrok.habrahabr.ru/blog/39367.html">Team Growth, First Steps</a> .
