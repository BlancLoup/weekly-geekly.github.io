Today we will talk about new online learning formats, namely, micro-learning, mobile learning and blended learning. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/3f2/d94/770/3f2d94770c87497195dff9536bbdc309.png"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  <font color="009900">Let's start with micro-learning or micro-learning</font> </h2><br>  It is known that the lion's share of students, faced with too cumbersome courses, throws it without finishing.  This problem was attempted by the creators of the micro-learning paradigm. <br><br>  According to the principles of micro-learning, the <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/happyfarm/blog/198084/">volume course is divided into short lessons</a> (more often in the form of video clips) of 5-7 minutes each.  In contrast to the ‚Äúclassic‚Äù hourly lesson, such micro-lessons are designed to help the student master the material in small steps, ‚Äúeat an elephant bit by bit,‚Äù and also learn in between work breaks ‚Äî it's easier to find 5‚Äì10 minutes of free time than to wait for a break or end of the day  Microtraining is not a new approach, but the use of the peculiarities of human perception of the brain, and, indeed, to hide, the current clip consciousness.

      The followers of microlearning <a href="http://elearningindustry.com/awesome-resources-on-micro-learning">talk</a> about the advantages of the method: greater involvement of students in the process, the possibility of learning in the process.  On the most well-known micro-course <a href="https://coursmos.com/">platform Coursmos</a> in the format of 1-3 minute clips are taught on a variety of topics.  True, it is difficult to call it a full-fledged course, they are more like a mini-presentation.  By this they remind everyone of the well-known <a href="http://www.ted.com/">Ted lectures</a> , which are also built on the principle of micro-learning.  Of the Russian-language programs, <a href="http://netology.ru/">Netology</a> courses can also be called followers of micro learning. <br><br>  Despite the ease of use and the undoubted benefits of micro-learning, this technology has its <a href="http://elearningindustry.com/microlearning-pros-and-cons">drawbacks</a> .  First of all, it is the impossibility to go through the volume topic ‚Äúin one sitting‚Äù.  Interruptions after 5-minute clips, a pause, again involvement in the process - such a ‚Äúragged‚Äù in itself can deprive of concentration.  Clips clips, but at some point you want to remove the "screen saver" and focus on the subject.  The second disadvantage is that microtraining does not train an arbitrary focus.  In other words, you get used to short lessons, and it is becoming more and more difficult for you to concentrate on something.  A relaxed and easy style of presentation harms the process of learning new knowledge - according to some, dry formal style is better suited for studying.  With the last argument, you can argue, but the first two, perhaps, make you think. <br><br><h2>  <font color="009900">The next type of online learning is something similar to the previous one - mobile learning or mLearning</font> </h2><br>  The rapid development of mobile technology has brought with it a new type of online learning.  Now you can study anywhere - the main thing is to have a smartphone or tablet on hand, the presence of a permanent Internet is not necessary - mLearning can be offline.  <a href="http://www.smart-edu.com/mobile-learning.html">Unlike classical e-learning,</a> mobile learning is almost always informal ‚Äî teachers and tutors do not usually participate at all, they can be replaced by experts who are well-experienced in presentation skills and are able to convey the meaning of the lesson in a fun way.  Training content for mLearning is either specially created, or it is carefully adapted and delivered in small, capacious, object portions - this is similar to micro-learning, which we spoke about earlier.  In this sense, a phone or tablet is the ideal tool for micro learning. <br><br>  The huge advantage of mobile learning compared to classic e-learning - greater student autonomy - now you can learn the basics of programming on Phyton even standing on the balcony.  Or on the escalator.  The speed and dynamism during the course is another significant plus. <br><br>  The most well-known Russian example of the implementation of the mLearning principles was the LinguaLeo application for teaching English.  Resource <a href="http://mymobileuni.com/">My Mobile University</a> provides free access from mobile devices to lectures and courses of major universities and business schools.  American teacher Tony Winsset and the author of the blog <a href="http://learninginhand.com/">Learning In Hand have</a> created a reference book in the form of <a href="http://learninginhand.com/blog/show-what-you-know-using-web-mobile-apps-infographic.html">infographics</a> on mobile applications for creating and distributing online courses for their students and sympathizers.  Thus, he implemented the thesis that ‚Äústudents can become teachers, and teachers can become even steeper teachers.‚Äù <br><br>  Mobile learning as a type of learning is constantly evolving, but some of the problems still remain unsolved.  There are both purely technical - limitations of devices in the amount of memory, battery charge and screen size, as well as organizational ones - it is difficult to unambiguously identify a student, for example, while passing the test.  In addition, the adaptation of content from ‚Äúclassic‚Äù e-learning to the format of mobile learning is a process that is quite expensive, and not everyone understands its usefulness.  There is also a purely psychological moment - with the active use of mobile devices in work and study, the boundary between the private life of the student and the worker is erased.  Although who cares now, is not it? <br><br><h2>  <font color="009900">Blended Learning</font> </h2><br>  Blended learning <a href="http://zillion.net/ru/blog/375/blended-learning-pieriekhod-k-smieshannomu-obuchieniiu-za-5-shaghov">implies a</a> mix of group education with a teacher and online learning.  The Blended Learning paradigm applies to both student and student learning and corporate employee training.  Currently, there are many <a href="http://elearningindustry.com/tips-use-blended-learning-in-corporate-training">models and submodels of</a> blended learning. <br><br>  To decide what needs to be done in the classroom, and what can be learned at home, what tasks are suitable for individual lessons, and which for group work on the project is the main task of the teacher who teaches in the blended learning system. <br><br>  The ‚Äúchip‚Äù of Blended Learning is considered to be the moment that parallel participation in ‚Äúlive‚Äù and online learning contributes to gaining independent and joint learning experience from students.  In addition, according to a study by Alexander McKenzie conducted in 1998, it is known that it is easier for students to assess their understanding of the material using computer assessment modules, rather than relying on the teacher‚Äôs opinion. <br><br>  As for specific courses, the effectiveness of Blended Learning is recognized when learning a foreign language.  Live communication, coupled with online reading, watching videos, visual "learning" words and interactivity, as well as possible helps to learn a new language. <br><br>  However, like any form of training, Blended Learning is not without drawbacks: the time spent on learning how to work with the Blending Learning Platform for both teachers and students, as well as the costs of organizing technical support and producing educational content is not always considered justifiable in small educational establishments. <br><br>  As a conclusion, it can be said that for certain purposes of training, and even the life credo of a teacher, it is better to choose the appropriate model.  The use of Blended Learning is most likely to be justified for studying bulk courses within the university, and a two-minute video in Micro Learning format for learning how to make Italian soup.  Mobile training is suitable for those who are used or forced to constantly on the road, for example, an active sales-manager or a busy negotiator.  And which format is closer to you? <br><br> <a href="http://teachbase.ru/landing/%3Futm_medium%3Dpost%26utm_source%3Dmegamozg%26utm_content%3DPost_18520"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b54/c26/9b1/b54c269b17a34122ba31a7f80eadd238.PNG"></a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/293632/">https://habr.com/ru/post/293632/</a></p>
