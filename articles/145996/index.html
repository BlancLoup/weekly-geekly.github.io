I want to share my own observations and impressions of the exhibition, and not just to list the new products that were presented. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/2d4/8f2/575/2d48f25750c4aeac30576a67ce461ff0.jpg"><br><br>  Under the cut a lot of photos.

      The first impression is that the exhibition is huge, several halls, many stands.  After the euphoria from the hot Asian air, you begin to understand that there are not so many differences from CeBIT.  Yes, of course, components are represented in Taiwan in a larger area, but critical superiority cannot be noted.  Of course, a huge selection of peripherals, but the right word, the same or almost the same mouse and keyboard does not deliver pleasure.  The embedded systems are much more widely represented, there are significantly more OEM / ODM manufacturers, but here too in recent years Hannover has been pulled significantly. <br><br>  However, let's start from the beginning.  The start of the inspection was given at the Taiwan World Trade Center, where I picked up the badge and went on a five-day journey across the expanses of Computex 2012. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/5ae/514/936/5ae514936c2ca6cbf5e5da643d178e77.jpg"><br><br>  The main event of the first day was a press conference of ASUS, dedicated to the products of the Republic Of Gamers series. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/534/fec/16d/534fec16d512732dc53a882f7848968b.jpg"><br><br>  The conference presented new laptops, mice, headphones, sound cards and gaming desktops.  The ASUS G55VW super gaming laptop boasts a third-generation Intel Core processor and the latest Kepler-based graphics card.  A key feature is support for the Thunderbolt interface.  The highest speed of operation is manifested in everything - the storage system is built on two SSD drives in a RAID 0 array. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/5b8/f04/812/5b8f048120eb4a828680c2c53a44ff7e.jpg"><br><br>  Gaming accessories are represented by a mouse ASUS GX 1000, the resolution of the sensor is 8200 dpi, and the gaming headset with Vulcan PRO active noise cancellation technology. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/f24/42c/3fd/f2442c3fdfea68e1aa0fba2712d3451c.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/9cc/73f/805/9cc73f80521d8250e4694c67fddf0f35.jpg"><br><br>  The ASUS ROG Tytan super-power and super-expensive gaming desktop attracted attention with its stylish design.  The configuration is not only assembled from the most powerful hardware, but also overclocked at the factory.  A good toy for those who do not like to mess with the settings, but loves all the most expensive and quick. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/d4a/1de/8ce/d4a1de8ceecd048a2bf9f2bb8c3879fb.jpg"><br><br>  Two overclockers, part-time engineers ASUS, Andre Yang and Shamino demonstrated nitrogen overclocking.  The guys collected two beautiful stands from the newest hardware - ASUS Maximus V Extreme, Intel Core i7-3770K, ASUS Radeon HD 7970 Matrix, stood a little behind them, literally five minutes turned on the SuperPi test to demonstrate the capabilities of proprietary software ... and the overclocking show ended.  Suddenly. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/9fc/dd2/036/9fcdd203682d4bbc31f7da99e9ee8a4a.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/80e/fae/596/80efae596655aa94f9d09a78ae938b4c.jpg"><br><br>  When everybody was going to disperse, a nyashechka came out on the scene with a super-novelty - an SSD drive with Thunderbolt interface - ASUS ROG Raidr.  Very quick thing, but there is no detailed information about it yet. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/469/cfd/c37/469cfdc3745cd9c86fdc1e03b40886b5.jpg"><br><br>  The second part of the ASUS exposition was located in Nangang Hall. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/618/84f/b76/61884fb76b48c909354a120889926949.jpg"><br><br>  In the ultrabook section, all attention was focused on the ZenBook Prime UX32.  I continue to say that this is my dream, I really like the prospect of working on the FullHD matrix. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/06a/c80/032/06ac80032ed24b430d6b765dd765dbd5.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/7b6/6f5/b58/7b66f5b58632ff5fca5bdc85961f0ea7.jpg"><br><br>  In addition to the products listed above, the Republic Of Gamers Corner also contained the ASUS Radeon HD 7970 Matrix, a special version with improved power and cooling systems. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/3d1/96d/be4/3d196dbe41d155a65a493446a6e1f092.jpg"><br><br>  The ASUS Maximus V Extreme motherboard is the new flagship of the line on the Intel Z77 chipset, the hardware of which is beyond description.  The board has all the modern controllers, and the overclocking potential surpasses all competitors. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/5d2/a60/c3a/5d2a60c3ae35597e43adf9c3560bf1d7.jpg"><br><br>  The line of "military" boards was presented in a modding version. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/4b7/a9f/61d/4b7a9f61d075c4657fe27fdedef4577a.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/f54/0dd/a7d/f540dda7ddcb7b10f71003f5925c74df.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/8d0/fa5/f59/8d0fa5f59aacdde78144e7b32012a51a.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/e6f/9f0/de9/e6f9f0de96de56a8d163c0dac02cae88.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/525/c28/5c5/525c285c57833ac94219544ad242eebb.jpg"><br><br>  Austrian company Noctua, known for its innovative cooling systems, brought several interesting prototypes.  One cannot surprise anyone with the number of heat pipes, so the original designs and weaving of radiator elements were used.  Option one - with perpendicular tubes. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/bb4/922/6b3/bb49226b3af24f9f7356e39d367a231c.jpg"><br><br>  Option two - with a two-story parallel arrangement of tubes. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/ccc/324/dd1/ccc324dd1cd9eecc40289f45305eceb0.jpg"><br><br>  The new family of A-series fans and a quiet fan with noise reduction technology. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/958/7c5/d31/9587c5d311a75aea06cd88d337b6c6fe.jpg"><br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/-atLQYr14zI%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700023,15700186,15700191,15700253,15700255,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhiHQmja13ReDwrRI-FxWwzz1n4KQA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  I was also pleased with the ultra-thin cooler for compact cases.  Noctua releases two versions - for Intel and for AMD platforms. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/4d4/72a/d48/4d472ad48f2f761e525cdacd5c59acab.jpg"><br><br>  ECS, also known as Elitegroup, presented a wide range of products at the exhibition: motherboards, video cards, all-in-one PCs and laptops. <br>  The current flagship is the ‚Äúgold‚Äù motherboard on the Intel Z77 chipset - the Z77H2-A2X attracts attention primarily with its appearance, but the performance is also high. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/67b/a48/b87/67ba48b8731255a72b144d19b0a7f9b7.jpg"><br><br>  One of the first boards for the new generation of AMD Trinity hybrid processors in the performance of Socket FM2. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/f33/7d0/e65/f337d0e659b29bdb01c8f7cf17a482ab.jpg"><br><br>  Since ECS is a major manufacturer of all-in-one PCs and compact systems, it‚Äôs no surprise that the board has an integrated processor and thin mini-ITX boards. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/0c4/a47/2d0/0c4a472d0cfa896c7cd9f6d96fe4ad86.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/ad0/06b/ce0/ad006bce085ac823a62bd975cc9e9505.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/9ac/60d/f16/9ac60df16991dc96ccda1d66a40f4311.jpg"><br><br>  The own version of the GeForce GTX 680 differs from the reference cooling system and higher operating frequencies.  There is nothing surprising in the color of kohuzha, passion for gold can be traced from the company's designers very clearly. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/e5b/14e/4e5/e5b14e4e5b2bc4f650106f36f592945b.jpg"><br><br>  At the stand there were two types of monoblocks - a diagonal of 21.5 and 24 inches.  I was more interested in older models.  A very good design, the possibility of modification (for example, installing a second hard disk instead of a DVD drive) and even an upgrade make them promising and competitive. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/5f5/94e/491/5f594e4911ba313e6c26bace875068dd.jpg"><br><br>  Unusually thin laptops and some ultrabook models are the company's debut, but according to ECS Vice President Sam Meng, they are ready to fight for this market and will strive to develop this area as quickly as possible. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/d6d/fec/01c/d6dfec01cfb362ba58a1fa111a7d8be4.jpg"><br><br>  Another well-known manufacturer of chassis and cooling systems SilverStone brought a new processor cooler and a very interesting case Sugo SG09. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/be7/36f/e11/be736fe11f29b959df648e901e040128.jpg"><br><br>  Only 20 liters of volume, but at the same time a full-sized power supply and video card, the ability to install a micro-ATX motherboard and overall CPU cooler, with 4 bays for HDD (although 2.5 ‚Äùformat).  Just a fantastic job of engineers. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/fcd/c24/dcc/fcdc24dccd5593b458a184f31a0cff7d.jpg"><br><br>  The SST-HE01 CPU cooler features an asymmetrical heatsink and a 38 mm thick fan between the sections. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/132/519/106/132519106fa95eef52388f7278115129.jpg"><br><br>  Compact model with six heat pipes for small form factor enclosures.  Thin 20 mm fan size 120 * 120mm is used to blow hot air. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/62e/51e/c5c/62e51ec5c1410145b6fc42694b6b0ac7.jpg"><br><br>  Giada presented its achievements in the field of ultra-compact motherboards.  There are 1155 socket boards and integrated versions with Ivy Bridge architecture processors. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/6e8/665/dae/6e8665dae03eee0d44e646df2832cb6b.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/947/d85/87b/947d8587be46243c4f0f852da80b0a29.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/791/731/2fb/7917312fbe94d503ebd56324226b28f0.jpg"><br><br>  SuperMicro was visible from afar.  These guys never tried to make a nanocomputer.  A huge server rack surrounded by local flora was the most popular place for photographs. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/8a1/7fd/a0b/8a17fda0b2d2f0688f4a8193b5b98700.jpg"><br><br>  Another OEM manufacturer Wibtek presented a beautiful candy bar, which is ready to accept Windows 8 and a motherboard named Hacker.  If I managed to touch the candy bar and draw conclusions about its quality (which, by the way, is very decent), the motherboard is still a mystery, outwardly normal, but what is it in the work ... ... <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/e21/074/569/e21074569a9a38669f59dd506cb2f4d7.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/aa5/b07/5a0/aa5b075a0207d2519c43ebbeb50ce8a1.jpg"><br><br>  Silicon Power brought new ultra-fast Compact Flash cards of 64 and 128 gigabytes. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/b38/dd9/c58/b38dd9c58806b908b59d9f0a1725ee17.jpg"><br><br>  Wi-Fi drives for mobile gadgets appeared not only in the range of Kingston, now similar <br>  Silicon Power has devices.  And, of course, the new SSD and USB flash drives - the basis of the company's range. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/12a/520/60e/12a52060e051b6eabcb85d60303fadc4.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/970/a25/5ac/970a255ace7f4742f1f76648f081b860.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/416/eff/f30/416efff30fdd9823a5d71415af69a7e1.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/fb7/c0a/f60/fb7c0af6046874ba7897884b2fe523d7.jpg"><br><br>  Lian Li entertained visitors with a train in the form of a train.  At the same time, two buildings worked, one of which served directly as a train, and the other worked as a control system. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/f49/995/682/f499956821dcb38e9d65f6db73edf891.jpg"><br><br>  Two ultra-compact aluminum models - with a "classic" power supply and SFX.  The enclosures are designed for installing mini-ITX boards. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/3ef/c87/ffc/3efc87ffc4a562071c2d17210c7b2c75.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/2e8/50d/d5e/2e850dd5ef4f06357cd89bcac951e200.jpg"><br><br>  As usual, a big one lives next to the little one.  Black Full Tower with a solid front panel has an original layout and 5.25 "external compartments placed on the side panel. The huge D8000 is apparently designed for those who like to handle Full HD video. It includes installation of 20 hard drives and CEB format motherboards. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/f49/6a4/16c/f496a416cdc87b8a705714a847451112.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/146/caf/94d/146caf94d92c438941627ac432295836.jpg"><br><br>  ADATA brought new SSD for ultrabooks.  And both the ‚Äúcores‚Äù and the small ones are caching.  In addition to the LG ultrabooks, ASUS ZenBook UX31E was demonstrated, which seemed to me strange, because in my copy SSD from Sandisk is used.  Most likely, this is the version for the Asian market. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/445/df3/b0b/445df3b0b91cd7545332d24e00199209.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/0db/d30/b7c/0dbd30b7c9672dd9c7a44de2ac2c91be.jpg"><br><br>  The XPG line is not yet as popular as the ASUS ROG, but a wide range and high quality should do the trick.  High-frequency memory Gaming series has already received positive feedback from overclockers from around the world. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/005/a53/c40/005a53c40c2e1940a3a6d833538c2ba2.jpg"><br><br>  And, of course, protected external disks in the sand - the main focus of ADATA at each exhibition.  Only disk volume and connection interface change, and the high degree of protection remains unchanged. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/ebe/d49/332/ebed49332ff268367522db047eeecbae.jpg"><br><br>  G.Skill brought a lot of overclockers and staged a real super show during which they conquered five different world records.  The international team gathered overclocking masters from Belgium, Japan, Australia, Switzerland, USA and Taiwan.  Beautiful girls at the booth and clubs of boiling nitrogen constantly attracted the attention of visitors to the exhibition. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/b85/87a/504/b8587a504d6992031b59aa2d8ee1b997.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/44b/f90/0df/44bf900df01eeebaa0b7843389c2a943.jpg"><br><br>  But apart from that, there was something to look at - 96 gigabytes of DDR3-1600 standard memory on a unique EVGA Classified SR-X motherboard.  The two most powerful Intel Xeon E5 processors have a new memory controller, which in nominal mode supports 1600 MHz. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/2f9/018/d8e/2f9018d8e39f47206b1c2d5a77e80272.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/ace/1e2/625/ace1e26254bb9a99d977cf5ef02f988c.jpg"><br><br>  Another interesting kit - 16 gigabytes at a frequency of 2800 MHz.  4 modules of 4 gigabytes, most likely based on Hynix chips, and are the fastest set of such a volume on the market. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/842/4a4/cca/8424a4cca0e6ed103d4285ccc1fcff50.jpg"><br><br>  Plextor showed the new SSD M3 Pro with a high random write speed.  In order not to be unfounded, the company representatives assembled a special stand to which two SSDs, the Plextor and OCZ, were connected.  The read-write tests were spinning in real time and the benefits of the Plextor products were visible to the naked eye. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/dab/51e/e7f/dab51ee7f6b8f38df0bb1c998fc4379e.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/510/a78/5ab/510a785ab266298d2cdb5362219c3288.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/a30/481/27d/a3048127dda1c8475917bbcd7cecb106.jpg"><br><br>  Lite-On begins its journey on the SSD market.  One of the first signs is the mSATA SSD for compact systems.  In the near future a full range of products will appear on the market. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/3eb/cb8/495/3ebcb8495e2073102318f70a8ef29282.jpg"><br><br>  A waterproof monoblock in an aquarium is one of the variants of protected systems from Chinese OEM manufacturers.  Such systems can easily be used at street kiosks or mobile points of payment. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/289/342/c9b/289342c9b5ec6c9076a1007fad336bd0.jpg"><br><br>  Albatron brought huge 27 inch monoblocks and interactive casting tables with 32-inch screens.  Once the company specialized in the production of motherboards and video cards, but times have changed. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/ea7/fb6/a76/ea7fb6a76871985476bb788812a16d6c.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/372/db9/581/372db958106f3871613412cf055ee8b8.jpg"><br><br>  Interactive tables are gaining popularity and an increasing number of manufacturers exhibit their own models.  The widest range of applications is from training tables for kindergartens and schools to serious systems for the joint work of design engineers. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/4b4/74e/5b3/4b474e5b375b6d1c8f1ad0428e129b7e.jpg"><br><br>  BitFenix ‚Äã‚Äã- one of the leaders of the European enclosure market for enthusiasts, brought several colorful models of enclosures.  The white version of the famous Shinobi case looks very stylish and modern. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/7f6/c01/4f6/7f6c014f60b9bf95f0661209d0af8150.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/c95/34f/b4a/c9534fb4a7b2e863ff60bdbafdd482a0.jpg"><br><br>  Prodigy case was presented in various colors for fans of bright and eye-catching systems.  It‚Äôs hard to imagine a room in orange, but even if you‚Äôre a fan of the Dutch national team, BitFenix ‚Äã‚Äãhas a case for you. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/155/a55/d33/155a55d33444da2b52e59e599368fb75.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/899/ece/56f/899ece56f370454912a0bf218f092e0b.jpg"><br><br>  Minicomputer on Android from Chinese OEMs.  A detailed article about it will be later, now I will mention the main properties of the device - USB port, USB host, card reader, mini-HDMI and Android 4.0 OS. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/2bc/704/37e/2bc70437e19d280667ee30f2f1c6cb3a.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/54e/153/a15/54e153a15839ed64199379e72d9d4089.jpg"><br><br>  Interesting brand Bloody, whose only products are gaming mice.  I have not yet seen such devices on the Russian market, but the brand image is very suitable for promotion in our country. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/dee/b46/9ae/deeb469ae260faf7d401b99b23fcdf23.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/fb5/ca3/3a2/fb5ca33a247e21bba0a200edae55af4f.jpg"><br><br>  Gigabyte demonstrated ultrabooks based on third-generation processors with discrete graphics cards on the Kepler core. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/673/6e1/266/6736e1266c2bfcb5fda0e355d7d2a57b.jpg"><br><br>  Of the video cards was introduced GeForce GTX 680 SuperOverClock with an innovative cooling system.  Five small fans blow the radiator from top to bottom.  I can‚Äôt say anything about noise, but surely gentle ears will not work under load. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/aeb/961/e92/aeb961e927511cbeac75c9336db6296b.jpg"><br><br>  Motherboards were hung on the big wall, and among all the variety there were models with integrated Wi-Fi modules, as well as an attempt to compete with the ASUS ROG Gene line - the Gigabyte G1.Sniper M3 motherboard.  The compact micro-ATX card is designed to build systems for a LAN party. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/e3b/da1/5e4/e3bda15e4e796251563b89543f1df40d.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/a79/365/098/a793650986d2239c239f64ded373cb30.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/239/927/f3a/239927f3a6f5dbcbaff74ae9a67aa826.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/2e4/7ad/3e3/2e47ad3e3b5b1868bb560d2e9b36f9b6.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/f21/191/581/f211915817773dbaaaecc6dff48ed6ba.jpg"><br><br>  Ford is not a bit associated with the main theme of the exhibition, but the conceptual Evos is so crammed with electronics that it was presented as a separate exhibit.  Unfortunately, they didn‚Äôt let go inside, so the photo is only the appearance of the car. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/a2e/4ac/f38/a2e4acf3892484968ed8fee170932a16.jpg"><br><br>  Apacer has brought a huge range of USB 3.0 flash drives and new SSD drives for the corporate and home sector. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/2df/840/b7a/2df840b7a2d6b112bf08e45b2ad9b0d1.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/8b6/e63/a7c/8b6e63a7ceca5d9e1ae698201c681f59.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/778/a51/e7e/778a51e7e833c9d64c6eb7ec6c9eeed6.jpg"><br><br>  Apacer ARES RAM has received a replenishment in the form of a high-speed set DDR3-2666.  The volume of the set attracts attention - 32 GB of excellent memory at high frequency. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/5c0/baf/dba/5c0bafdbafd7742ca4d68b52e4e11b45.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/1c8/f42/a20/1c8f42a20a71a1e69f5ee74723fd7062.jpg"><br><br>  And this is a stylish set of Snow Leopard for modders.  Given the wide range of white cases, it is time for manufacturers to think about producing motherboards on a white PCB. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/733/b8a/7a5/733b8a7a5110e7fb54c0e43603256a5b.jpg"><br><br>  The local manufacturer of ready-made liquid cooling systems Larkooler introduced the iSkyWater 520 model with water blocks for the processor and video card, as well as the novelty of air cooling - iSky Tower 60SN, which is able to dissipate up to 240 W of heat generated. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/10c/728/32f/10c72832f6ee5442114dd36c5c165a38.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/f88/2d3/7d8/f882d37d8ad93b58a7292d0bf3f9d6e2.jpg"><br><br>  Cougar is a gaming brand from HEC / Compucase.  High quality workmanship and stylish design distinguish products.  By the way, notice again the white color - white cases, white power supplies, white RAM - where are the white motherboards? <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/d91/774/c3e/d91774c3e36804bab9fac697dca8764a.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/1df/128/ebc/1df128ebc7fbd3a6d7adf2d05b328c16.jpg"><br><br>  Gaming keyboards are a popular area of ‚Äã‚Äãbusiness development, and Cougar could not resist. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/844/4cb/b58/8444cbb580bf2536826277cceceac10b.jpg"><br><br>  Geil is also expanding towards gaming accessories - the new keyboard and mouse were on display at the exhibition.  The mouse differs in that it has two sensors installed at once, which should contribute to more accurate positioning. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/68d/ed6/6fa/68ded66fad0aa0955f4cb4b96d25728c.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/e37/885/93a/e3788593af8beb74f4268f8f54487896.jpg"><br><br>  Of course, not white PCB, but white radiators - the general trend is maintained.  Yes, and the highest speed.  The new EVO Veloce series promises to be popular. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/5d7/1b1/bd2/5d71b1bd29d3e3c4a719378e55b014f1.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/1a7/b50/4d9/1a7b504d90781462dd065e24843e55b2.jpg"><br><br>  The new SSDs Geil Zenith 3 are not yet represented on the Russian market, but will soon appear.  Based on the popular SandForce SF-2281 controller, they demonstrate read / write speeds up to 560/530 MB / s. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/191/36b/56b/19136b56b48ae060dcfc2318b0ed70d4.jpg"><br><br>  At the stand Aerocool was put up an interesting mod on a military theme.  The base case - Aerocool Strike-X Air is a basically open stand with easy access to all components. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/024/828/e45/024828e452fd7ed5bceac04d74601319.jpg"><br><br>  Acer presented a large number of new laptops, including those based on the new APU Trinity. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/849/322/498/849322498817554be97d3f16d370b055.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/ddd/031/e0f/ddd031e0f11887e05b03186b958546d3.jpg"><br><br>  The world's thinnest ultrabook - Acer Aspire S5 <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/1ee/953/3bc/1ee9533bca2ff5e123da4eca964b4c8c.jpg"><br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/A_TWzucYVyI%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700023,15700186,15700191,15700253,15700255,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhjt_wPJmNLSTR87kAz68yfUNhuWBg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  Zotac as usual brought small and powerful computers.
