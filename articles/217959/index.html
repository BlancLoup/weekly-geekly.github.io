  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Mysterious game from IBM</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Yesterday was published an interesting <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/217671/">post</a> about the mysterious announcement from IBM with some kind of encrypted text.  All pretty quickly agreed on the fact that the text most resembles an invitation to work, in itself being a kind of exam for the applicant.  Armed with dictionaries, special software and driven by the desire to become part of IBM users rushed to the assault.  And it seems to me - not a linguist and not a cryptographer - that they rushed in a completely different direction. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  To understand what is at stake, and at what stage of the discussion, it is better to get acquainted with <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1w3exfQcEVfi1uoF9GTG4O7ksLSzsY5lBGk7qqMOogpQ/preview%3Fpli%3D1%26sle%3Dtrue">this</a> collective document.  The text itself will not bring, it is in the original article.  In addition, the purpose of this post is solely to shake up those who are already interested, and offer another direction for discussion. <br><br><h4>  Scandals, intrigues, investigations </h4><br>  I will sound a banal thought: if someone really deciphered the message, we would know (whether?) About it last.  Therefore, the general public has to be content with only each other's conjectures.  So I will start in order from the thoughts that I had in the last few hours: <br><br><ul><li>  Do not look for incomprehensible words in Catalan or Latin.  Despite the fact that, most likely, the language is synthesized from a number of existing, unsuitable words will always be an order of magnitude more than acceptable in meaning. </li><li>  Do not look for articles and prepositions.  Too few recurring or short words. </li><li>  It is worth looking for repeated words.  I am not at all interested in how and from what they originated, but the stylistics of the text, as well as the structure of the language and punctuation, are intuitive and allow to draw conclusions about the meaning of words in their context. </li><li>  Many words still resemble real ones and cause semantic associations for a reason.  One IBM corporata is worth something.  Sorry, I'm not a polyglot, because the connection with English, for example, is <i>felt</i> very strongly. </li></ul>

      <br>
      So, what conclusions did I come to? <br><br><h4>  The essence </h4><br>  I will not describe the whole chain of reasoning, but the principle, as you understood, was the following: first, the most common words, based on the structure of the sentence, are ranked in frequency of use.  Then they are tried on the entire list of possible values ‚Äã‚Äãfrom the context of values, which are then refined / eliminated at the expense of other, less used ones.  So, the most understandable words in the text, the meanings of which subsequently seem obvious: <br><br>  Tro = to (English); <br>  Rol = translate, decrypt; <br>  Rita = this; <br>  Gizon = reason, reason, premise; <br>  Prin = text; <br>  Olla = my, my, ours; <br>  Ol = he; <br>  Lina = she, her, him; <br>  Diptar = message; <br>  Trondiptar = encrypted message; <br>  Introndiptaral = decrypt from trondiptar <br>  And etc. <br><br>  Having spent a few hours, I received something like this (not a strict version, simplified or supplemented for understanding): <br><br><blockquote>  IBM You're Next (new)! <br>  The one who translates: do not tell anyone.  Each player / individual tends to do something and become cooler.  Whoever did something more, became steeper.  You are next!  Now you select the following! <br><br>  Achieving the main task is a reason for the complex to become even more difficult.  Rontar Crips (1920 - 1978) left an encrypted message that said: ‚ÄúA certain greeting!  My predecessor / mother, Lavanna Cripps, encrypted a secret message from IBM.  She was there / * someone? * / In 1946. What is it?  In 1960, having received it, / * someone * / deciphered it!  Having translated her message, he read: ‚Äú <i>Biz it corporat dana.</i>  <i>Crodana!</i>  ‚Äú.  Translation of this text is a reason to correct / complicate it!  He says: having translated my message, he / * anyone * / is fit / suitable <i>fio jidf</i> company!  Small, <i>ctou, bizon</i> message.  You are the next / new pinta company! ‚Äù <br><br>  <i>Kro</i> it?  This is the right / occasion <i>kro lapta</i> . <br><br>  Below are a couple of links, both in English: <br><br>  ... <br><br>  You are now the next one to select the next! <br></blockquote><br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Stricter translation</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  Below are just words that occur more than once or are obvious: <br><br>  <b>IBM You are next / new!</b> <br>  Oioj fivj transoj: pramsiga <b>to</b> nonce.  Iof unita cramberri <b>to</b> fifs, <b>to</b> gint <b>and to</b> <b>become</b> friega.  Pro gint gita, pro gint <b>becomes a</b> friega ... <b>You're Next!</b>  <b>You select / assign the following!</b>  ! <br><br>  Efforta <b>cause / reason / task</b> primta, <b>this reason / reason / task</b> dif <b>to</b> <b>become</b> dif.  <b>Rontar Crisp</b> (1920 - 1978) crops din <b>scrambled</b> , uronta gip lotran girrin: ‚ÄúLap tirin!  <b>My predecessor / mother Levanna Crisp</b> <b>translated the</b> crupida <b>message</b> <b>from IBM</b> .  Fi 1946 <b>she</b> uinda-pris divka.  Ro prov?  Pra 1960 giz kim, allonza <b>deciphered</b> <b>it</b> <b>!</b>  <b>Having translated her encrypted</b> message <b>, he</b> untro: ‚ÄûBiz it corporat dana.  Crodana! ‚Äú <b>Translation of this text is an occasion to</b> pips!  <b>He</b> srun: <b>having translated our message, he is (impersonal, probably)</b> sui fio jidf <b>corporation!</b>  Mina, ctou, bizon <b>message</b> .  <b>You are the next / new</b> pinta <b>corporation</b> ! ‚Äù <br><br>  Kro kim?  <b>This is the reason</b> kro lapta. <br><br>  Utro kin lint biz lon <b>English</b> : <br><br>  1. <b>Text of</b> diga <b>corporation</b> : <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM</a> <br><br>  2. <b>Our / my predecessor / mother</b> crov fotodaps (krin so darva jo, din tra noncabar truna IBM dzecorporata): <a href="">upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/20/IBM_Electronic_Data_Process_Machine_-_GPN-2000-001881.jpg 757px-IBM_Electronic_Data_Processing_Machine _-_ GPN-2000-001881.jpg</a> <br><br>  U lip-trod.  <b>You select new ones who</b> mit <b>new ones!</b> <br></div></div><br><br>  In general, the essence is clear - it seems that this is a kind of game, and, most likely, intra-Aybiems.  The task of the game is to understand the text, encrypted in some way, and if successful, encrypt your own so that the next lucky one can guess it.  Each time, the complexity of the cipher increases due to a higher encryption / decryption skill. <br>  By the way, there are no addresses or phone numbers in the text, and moreover, I have a suspicion that the university, in which this text was posted, does not have a special relationship. <br>  I repeat, I am neither a linguist, nor an IT specialist, nor a cryptographer, and I suggest that all of those mentioned just take note of the information provided.  Perhaps this will narrow the search range. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/217959/">https://habr.com/ru/post/217959/</a></p>
