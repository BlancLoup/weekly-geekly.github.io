  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Wireless sensor networks</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Recently, at one of the Riga conferences, the topic of wireless sensor networks was discussed - a presentation from Leo Selyava, a researcher from the University of Virginia, who in some way interested me.  I tried to look for something in this direction on Habr√©, but it did not give any results.  Therefore, I will literally try to reveal at least the basis of the theme on my fingers. <br><br>  To understand what <strong>wireless sensor networks</strong> ( <strong>BSNs</strong> ) are (they are also <strong>wireless sensor networks</strong> or <strong>WSN</strong> ), imagine an array of devices that are remote from each other, typically relatively small in size, each of which is an independent sensor. <a name="habracut"></a>  Under the sensor is meant that the device performs a specific function of obtaining information about the environment in one way or another.  Simply, the microphone can be a sound sensor, the infrared port can be a light sensor.  There are classes of sensors that measure temperature, humidity, atmospheric pressure, light activity, position in space, acceleration, platform inclination, magnetic fields ... The network‚Äôs meaning is that all sensors included in such a network communicate with each other and transmit the received data to the main node is the gate.  From this node the information goes to the computer. <br><br>  A separate sensor is usually built from a microcontroller, a battery and, of course, a radio element.  As a radio communication method, today's sensor networks are most often used by the <strong>ZigBee</strong> and <strong>Wibree</strong> standards still in development.  Although it was possible to build sensors on existing methods, such as WiFi and Bluetooth, these two standards are designed to minimize power consumption during radio broadcasts.

      The logic of the sensor network is organized by a special operating system of the ‚Äúlow weight category‚Äù.  We were shown <strong>TinyOS</strong> and <strong>LiteOS</strong> , on which they work at the University of Virginia, but in addition to it there are a lot of other operating systems.  All of this, like many other devices, is programmed in assembler or C, but as part of the research, they also develop specialized programming languages, specific frameworks that provide a simplified implementation of typical tasks of microcontrollers on sensors. <br><br>  The FSU find its application in a wide range of practical sciences - medicine, logistics, construction, seismology.  You can consider specific examples of application. <br><br>  Experimental FSU <strong>BikeNet is</strong> based on bicycles, on which about two dozen sensors of different types are installed.  The architecture of this network allows the movement of bicycles around the city (which can be easily realized, for example, in Copenhagen, where bicycles are a familiar transport) the network organizes information about the situation of roads. <br><br>  BSS <strong>ZebraNet</strong> - a network in which zebras wear collars with sensors.  This network can transmit weather conditions.  Although this FSU is based on animals, it can function relatively well.  Even predators attacking zebras, left the collars safe and sound.  However, as it turned out during testing, the fins themselves bit each other by their collars.  :) There was a similar stationary network where sensors were scattered across the jungle - which allowed scientists to observe a rare species, sorry, I don‚Äôt remember any rodents. <br><br>  The FSU can be organized on the surface of a volcano in order to evacuate the city in time.  Or place sensors on bridges to prevent further disasters.  Sensors have already tried to place in a person (Lukyanenko had a similar story ‚ÄúGadget‚Äù). <br><br>  Of course, in these studies there is a prospect, however, as far as we know, almost all the technologies used in the FSU are currently under development and are still trying to solve the problems of reducing power consumption, mobility, communication of network nodes over long distances ... <br><br>  I suggest that you ask the research of the FSU. <br><br>  I apologize for not decorating the text with illustrations - just material on the topic is now available in the form of chaos, and its organized versions are laconic.
