And although it is a logical continuation of the <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/hardware/121906/">post about the steering wheel of Thrustmaster</a> , the discussion here will be not about any particular manipulator, but about a more advanced system for simulating various races in general. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  After the release of the review of the T500 RS, the fate of the hands of the guys from Thrustmaster brought me to a man named Alexander Kazmin.

      ‚ÄúDo you want to,‚Äù they say, ‚Äúsee what happens if you put our steering wheel on steep racing seats?‚Äù <br>  - I want, of course! <br>  - Well, then the road to you at Moscow City Racing - everyone will show you and tell you. <br><br>  I come to Bolotnaya Square, and there is full preparation for the upcoming races and related entertainment.  In one of the small pavilions, I find Sasha, and he shows me a racing chair with an embroidered GameSTUL logo, and in front of him are five television sets, connected "curling iron" and Thrustmaster T500 RS - the perfect set for playing Gran Turismo.  Being "inside" of such a thing, you feel the notorious effect of presence not only due to the panorama of LCD panels, but also with your whole body: the steering wheel resists and vibrates, and the body is trapped in the seat bucket, which also shakes tremendously on uneven tracks.  The only thing missing is simulations of overload during acceleration and deceleration.  Although, if desired, and money, it is possible to install pneumatic drives, which will begin to rock the structure.  But this is a custom, not a standard order. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/20e/955/8b8/20e9558b82857121c7fb55d2c9e99221.jpg"><br><br>  A couple of years ago, the guys from GameSTUL didn't know what they would do now.  Once, one of them wanted to buy a racing chair: the Internet showed that they don‚Äôt do this in Russia, but what can be ordered from abroad is either too expensive or too flimsy.  While they were building the first ‚Äúchair‚Äù, it became clear that there were a lot of people willing to buy the same one, and after a couple of years they had five models of varying complexity for any purpose.  Love the Spartan conditions and do not want to overpay - well, take the miniSTUL for 4.5 kilo shipping.  I would like speakers and vibration feedback, or something else more confused - no one bothers to contact the guys and order a piece thing from them. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/9ad/71e/645/9ad71e64599bde4d204ef3ae451a2c8d.jpg"><br>  <i>Here this transformer, for example, is called revolution.</i>  <i>The sticking design is patented and is able to work as an ordinary chair, and racing.</i>  Who cares - please <a href="">photo a little more.</a>  (Hmm, it turns out Habrastorage cuts the size of pictures 0_o) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/252/ef7/0c8/252ef70c8ba72b6a2b5e0df07a664189.jpg"><br><br>  An important moment for me is strength.  ‚ÄúChairs‚Äù are made of steel, aluminum and composites, so I safely sat in a chair.  Meanwhile I weigh the order of a centner :) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/19b/35d/277/19b35d2776fcda7895287800105bc27b.jpg"><br><br>  The most interesting thing is that recently it is possible not only to speculatively speculate whether you want such a chair or not, but to try to sit in it yourself in a specially arranged place for this.  GameSTUL is not going to stop there and in every way tries to popularize the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãan advanced racing simulation.  Recently, a GoRace showroom opened in Moscow at the Nagornaya metro station in the Territory of the Kant sports complex, with the support of various companies, where you can simultaneously watch new TV sets and the design of the chairs, and, of course, all kinds of steering wheels and pedals, ranging from most simple, ending with the top Logitech and Thrustmaster.  The first time I looked there at the beginning of autumn, when the room was still being repaired, but now there is already something to potent.  So I strongly advise you to go back to those who, like me, love to drive on virtual tracks.  You can make a sortie during the day, or you can, as in the good old days, by company overnight in the ‚Äúcomputer club‚Äù <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/c10/953/430/c1095343086fc3c753ea3faac79d8a84.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/e5b/9bb/df3/e5b9bbdf3c29edd25c753d419cf694b1.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/2a6/abe/426/2a6abe426676aa9235eebdfd067b1afa.jpg"><br>  <i>And in the bins there was a photo of the cybersportsman in the not yet completed GoRace.</i>  <i>Who will guess what his name is ... well done!</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/eb5/e29/c74/eb5e29c74f51d21dd73eba58050d16fc.jpg"><br>  <i>And here it is, but after the completion of construction.</i> <br><br>  PS The purpose of the post is not to tell all the technical details of each seat and steering wheel, but rather just to share pleasant surprise - I did not think to find a similar production in Russia, to be honest :) <br><br>  PPS At the request of the workers contacted Sasha Kazmin and found out whether there is a video.  It turned out that the project ‚ÄúI invented‚Äù was shooting about him. <br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/rTd1216oUvs%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700019,15700186,15700190,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhhAomA1kYoa1fbqJ9jU2-gv1yVZag" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/135359/">https://habr.com/ru/post/135359/</a></p>
