With a minimum expenditure of time, it is necessary to plan an information day, both in terms of content, priorities, and in terms of information presentation forms. <br><br>  <b>What is wrong today that we took on this task?</b>

      We forget about possible multimedia forms, have little creative in the development of topics, skip interesting perspectives, often go "along the beaten track" <br><br>  <b>What are we doing?</b> <br><br>  An easy-to-use tool that allows you to quickly go through the basic planning phase and stimulates the work of editors and correspondents in disclosing a specific topic / event. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Rule: For each participant of the planning meeting, an understanding is formed that planning an information day is work that is done before the morning planning meeting.  At the planning meeting, only coordination of topics, determination of priorities, and brainstorming to finalize the proposed themes and forms take place. <br><br>  <b>Step 1</b> <br>  Each participant of the planning meeting comes to her with a list of candidate topics. <br>  Each topic is presented in the form of written answers to the questions: <br>  ‚Ä¢ What <br>  ‚Ä¢ Where (the territory of the event and its consequences) <br>  ‚Ä¢ When <br>  ‚Ä¢ Who from our audience and how will the event affect? <br>  ‚Ä¢ Who are the main players of the event - people and organizations? <br>  ‚Ä¢ Context - what was the prerequisite for the event, why did events unfold in this way? <br>  ‚Ä¢ Agents of influence.  Who is interested in the event?  What scenarios of further development are possible from the point of view of different ‚Äúagents of influence‚Äù on the event. <br>  ‚Ä¢ Spectrum of opinions.  Who looks at an event differently? <br><br>  <b>Step 2</b> <br>  The recommended degree of depth of study topics: <br>  1. <b>Main theme</b> : development of a theme with the maximum available number of parties in several territories with the active involvement of accessible user content. <br>  2. <b>Actual topic</b> : the topic is worked out by journalists from the maximum available number of parties without a separate organization of user activity <br>  3. <b>Interesting topic</b> : a multimedia information package reporting the event. <br>  4. <b>The plot in the tape</b> : an informational message (a series of messages) about the event <br><br>  <b>Step 3</b> <br>  Topics are written on the board in blocks in accordance with the recommended depth of study of the topic. <br>  <b>Step 4</b> <br>  Discussion topics.  The result is ranking, prioritization, transfer of topics from block to block, determining the circle of those responsible for a specific topic. <br>  <b>Step 5</b> <br>  The formats of each topic.  Just tick the questionnaires: <br><br>  1. Infographics.  What do we show? <br><ul><li>  Event development in time (timeline) </li><li>  The development of events in the territories </li><li>  Comparison with similar event (data) in the past or future </li><li>  Comparison with similar event (data) in another territory </li><li>  Algorithm of user behavior (what if you are inside an event?) </li><li>  Route </li><li>  Map </li><li>  Shares, ratios, data change dynamics </li><li>  Subject in a section, spare parts with signatures </li><li>  Something else__________ </li></ul><br>  2.
