However, there are other, equally influencing our health habits.  For example, coffee.  Many cannot start their day without a fragrant drink, but is it really important? <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Do you look like a zombie if you don‚Äôt drink a cup of coffee in the morning?  Instead of using caffeine, it is better to pick up certain foods that will provide you with the necessary charge of energy.  By making only small changes in the diet, you can prevent morning weakness and downturns of activity throughout the day. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/48a/96d/604/48a96d604eed46879349291357b1adf8.jpg"><br><br><h4>  Why should you give up caffeine? </h4><br>  I do not drink coffee.  Sometimes I drink caffeinated tea, but only in cases where it is really necessary.  Despite the fact that caffeine does not have such a negative impact on human health, like other special drugs, it is still far from those substances that are beneficial.  Here are some reasons to reduce the number of cups of coffee consumed:

    <ol><li>  <b>Caffeine addiction.</b>  Typically, withdrawal syndromes suffer from former smokers and drug addicts.  Nevertheless, many who are addicted to caffeine, suffer from something similar for several weeks when they are trying to reduce its consumption.  Why should we create addiction ourselves? </li><li>  <b>Dehydration.</b>  Caffeine is a diuretic, so by drinking a cup of coffee (or tea) you will eventually lose water. </li><li>  <b>Post-caffeine effects.</b>  You will be able to significantly increase the amount of your energy, but what will happen next when it ends?  Continuing to increase the dosage of caffeine would not be a good option, and the body will get a lot of stress. </li></ol><br><br><h4>  Change your diet to get more energy. </h4><br>  <b>Food is fuel.</b>  If you do not fill your body with the right fuel, or you don‚Äôt regularly refuel, it will take quite a bit of time before your reserves run out.  Here are a few dietary options that I use to keep my energy supply sufficient throughout the day. <br><br><h5>  Transition from 2-3 times to 4-5 times a day </h5><br>  The decisive factor determining the amount of energy is the level of glucose.  If you only have lunch and dinner, there will be surges in your body, followed by large energy losses.  A lot of effort and takes the process of digestion.  You experienced it yourself if you ever felt sleepy after dinner.  Separation of meals by a large number of times smoothes glucose level surges and thus facilitates the processes of digestion. <br><br><h5>  Use low glycemic index foods at bedtime </h5><br>  In the morning it can be difficult, because your body is starving during the night's rest.  Eat low-glycemic foods in small amounts at bedtime.  These include whole grains, vegetables and some fruits.  After I started practicing it, it became much <b>easier for</b> me <b>to wake up right after the first alarm</b> . <br><br><h5>  Eat fruit on an empty stomach </h5><br>  It takes much less time to digest fruit than for denser products.  They are processed for about 20-30 minutes instead of 1-3 hours.  Eating fruits on an empty stomach allows them to digest quickly and, accordingly, much faster than any other food, to increase blood glucose levels. <br><br><h5>  The transition to fasting food </h5><br>  Perhaps you are so fond of steak, that you simply won't allow yourself to become a vegetarian.  But this does not mean that you can not reduce the amount of meat in the diet.  With a high content of protein and fat, it is very difficult to digest; it requires much more energy than vegetarian substitutes.  Meat, as a rule, contains many hormones and pesticides, which can also affect your energy level. <br><br><h5>  Drink your 8 glasses </h5><br>  Two thirds of our bodies are made up of water and need H2O to perform their basic functions.  Keep a <b>bottle of water on your desktop</b> while you work and regularly refill it.  When you come to the gym, also take a bottle with you, and not just grab a couple of sips from the drinking fountain.  Somewhere I read a good way to determine if I consume enough fluid.  Need to look at the color of urine.  If it is a little darker than light yellow, then you need to drink a lot more water.  (Translator supplement: IT staff is much easier to <a href="http://www.goodhabit.ru/category/zozh-v-it/">use mobile applications</a> to control the water balance in the body, for example, the same WaterBalance) <br><br><h5>  Eat whole grains </h5><br>  I have already mentioned the importance of eating foods with a low glycemic index for energy.  This most glycemic index shows the speed of digestion in the body.  Quickly split carbohydrates, produce an energy surge, which quickly disappears.  At the same time, these products can have a good effect if you need to recuperate after exercise.  But on an ordinary day, they will lead to negative consequences.  If you eat whole grains, then provide yourself with a constant supply of energy. <br><br><h5>  Avoid the desire to indulge in something sweet in the middle of the day. </h5><br>  In the afternoon, we usually lack energy.  Often, at about three in the afternoon, glucose levels in our bodies drop, and we begin to starve for lack of strength.  This is precisely the time when many have the desire to drink even more coffee with a high sugar content.  <b>Avoid the temptation to consume long-term "fuel".</b>  It is better to eat low-glycemic fruit or whole grain foods instead. <br><br>  Are you ready to get rid of the habit of consuming a lot of caffeine for your health?  Perhaps you know more effective ways, share them with us in the comments. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/290538/">https://habr.com/ru/post/290538/</a></p>
