  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Red Hat Workshop. Impressions</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img align="right" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/729/b98/7ec/729b987ec995e171ffe3a835c99e4a6d.jpg">  On Tuesday, February 21, a <a href="http://vdel.ru/node/428">Red Hat partnership seminar</a> was held.  If suddenly you have a thought like ‚ÄúWhy I haven‚Äôt heard anything about it,‚Äù I answer - because you do not have Red Hat partner status.  :-) <br><br>  So, this seminar was very different from those on which I was previously, because  its main part was devoted to marketing, affiliate program, the story of logistics and other Labuda, which is perfect for me is not interesting.  I think that you too.  :-) But among the aforementioned topics were two reports, for which I came - Red Cloud Cloud Strategy and RHEV 3.0, read by Karl Stevens, Red Hat Senior Solution Architect.  All that he was talking about, I will definitely write here someday.  But now, as originally planned, there will be a description of impressions and some <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/java/138333/">comparison with Java Day</a> . <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  The Red Hat workshop was held at <a href="http://digitaloctober.ru/">Digital October</a> .  I think that on Habr√© no one needs to tell what this place is.  The ‚Äúbare brick‚Äù on the inner walls of the DO strongly contrasted with the European renovation of the hotel where Java Day was held.  And although getting to DO is not too convenient, those who got there, waited for a hot coffee and a warm welcome.  Well, in general, the place turned out to be quite pleasant, in the sense that there is some kind of ‚ÄúIT spirit‚Äù, something cyberpunk.

So there were just over 20 people, and the event was held in a warm, friendly atmosphere.  By the way, despite such a small number of people, the translator was found (unlike JavaDay).  And when on the sidelines I wondered if Red Hat was planning to hold any large-scale events, such as Java Day, I was told that at the moment the company's policy is to support "general" major events, such as the upcoming <a href="http://www.pcweek.ru/foss/conference/">Russian Open Source Summit 2012</a> .  And now Red Hat is focused on helping Russian partners build a business on Open Source. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/7bc/3aa/03c/7bc3aa03c6375535cbf8007c19bd8a37.jpg"><br>  <i>Karl Stevens talks about the Red Hat cloud strategy against the background of the appropriate rolap.</i> <br><br>  As in the case of Java Day, the main ‚Äúvector‚Äù of Red Hat solutions development is directed towards cloud computing, which is logical, since  This is a general course of the entire IT industry.  Despite the fact that there were only two technical reports, both of them, personally for me, were very useful.  Well, in general, it's nice to know a little earlier about the company's plans.  =) Of the noticed minuses - presentations designed for a projector are not very suitable for showing on ‚Äúplasma‚Äù. <br><br>  This is how the set of handouts looked like: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/3bd/179/442/3bd1794420c9d4e58c3b0846d947b006.jpg"><br><br>  By the way, those who filled in the questionnaire were presented with such headphones: <br><img align="right" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ab9/0f4/9be/ab90f49bed46d2631c55bd8c14f24611.jpg"><br><br>  So, in February, I attended two events - Java Day and a Red Hat seminar for partners, which turned out to be completely different.  They turned out to be different not because companies have different fields of activity, but simply because the format of events is different.  Therefore, my initial idea to compare the activities of companies competing with each other in the field of virtualization, OS, middleware, cloud computing and other system software failed.  :-) Despite this, I hope that my "impressions" for someone will be useful. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/138866/">https://habr.com/ru/post/138866/</a></p>
