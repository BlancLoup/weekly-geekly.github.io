  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Trigger Timer for Nikon</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  At the beginning of April last year, in preparation for a long trip, which was a dream of my life, I bought myself a new camera.  Before that, I had only soap dishes.  Four pieces in turn.  Soap trays began to hold me down.  More and more.  Both in terms of image quality, and in terms of what they allowed me.  In general, Nikon D5000 KIT was purchased.  The device is beautiful, I really liked it and I still like it.  Of course, today I would change it for something more serious, because I have gained not a little experience, but it is expensive, and the D5000 is not very bad. <br>  A year has passed.  More time has passed.  The available maximum of 30 seconds of exposure has become increasingly annoying.  Sometimes I wanted more.  The device allowed, while keeping the button pressed, did not close the shutter until the power sat down, but you would not stand by all this time and make a move to it.  The second point: I wanted to shoot lightning.  It is not realistic to catch a lightning manually, and it is of little use to use for this a great shutter speed in our area.  I also wanted to expand my abilities in terms of shooting timelapse.  The built-in capabilities of the camera was not enough.  Well, it was still nice to get a chance to hook my Nikon on a tripod and operate it without touching the camera itself.  I don‚Äôt want to carry a laptop for this with a special software.  As a result, 2 "cables" were ordered, one of which I want to briefly tell. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  <b>Description</b> <br><br>  The device includes a large convenient handle, a release button with a latch, a programmable timer, timer control keys, a two-color LED, a buzzer (picker), a wire about half a meter in length and a plug.  The screen has a backlight, which itself goes out after seconds.  Positioned as a <a href="http://dx.com/p/digital-timer-remote-switch-trigger-for-nikon-d90-d5000-2-aaa-51751">Digital Timer Remote Switch Trigger for Nikon D90 / D5000</a> .  Worth US $ 23.90.  It was bought on <a href="http://www.dx.com/">www.DX.com</a> .  Dimensions: 15.5 cm x 4.0 cm x 1.9 cm.

    <img src="http://www.habrastorage.com/images/fdv327hqh.jpg"><br><br>  Externally, the "cable" is absolutely identical to the same device from Nikon.  Well, absolutely!  Only the company name above the screen is different. <br><br>  <b>What this device allows</b> <br><br>  The device allows, in fact, to remotely focus and descend.  To do this, just click on the largest button on its body.  The button has the same properties as the shutter release button on the camera itself, i.e.  easy pressing - prefocusing, pressing stronger - triggering the shutter.  The button can be fixed pressed by sliding it forward.  Returning to its original position, you release the lock and the button is released.  Do not forget, if you do not use LiveView and do not look into the finder when shooting, close the peephole with a special lock that came with the camera in the kit.  Otherwise, the extra light caught in it will not allow the camera to correctly determine the exposure time. <br>  The timer is controlled by the other buttons.  Buttons to the right and left move the cursor between the positions that you will adjust. <br><br><img src="http://www.habrastorage.com/images/fdv3275dsc.jpg"><br><br>  Buttons up and down - make changes to a specific position when setting shooting parameters. <br>  The SET button turns on the actual setting mode in the selected position. <br>  Button Timer start / stop starts and stops the timer. <br>  Button O / Lock - turns on the backlight and lock all the other keys from being accidentally pressed. <br>  You can: <br>  - in the first position to fix the delay in launching the shooting program; <br>  - in the second position, set how long the shutter button will be pressed when the timer is triggered (it is logical only for the manual shooting mode); <br>  - in the third position indicates the shutter interval; <br>  - in the fourth - the number of frames that need to be captured (0-399-infinite); <br>  - in the fifth - whether the device can use the built-in buzzer. <br><br>  <b>Nutrition</b> <br><br>  I basically was looking for a device with the most capacious power.  Among them is a huge mass of those that are powered by CR2025 batteries.  I don't like these at all.  I was very pleased to find the cable on the half-half.  I bought it.  It does not have a shutdown button, but with such a power supply it is definitely not a hindrance.  Batteries will die more from old age than from the power consumption of the timer.  In the photo that came in the kit. <br><br><img src="http://www.habrastorage.com/images/fdv3276dsc.jpg"><br><br>  The timer was tested on exposures from 5 to 30 minutes.  He coped with his task perfectly well.  It was also tested when shooting with a tripod with a remote control.  Fine, I tell you! <br><br>  As for the second ordered device, so, in fact, the usual remote button.  I want to make a photo detector out of it.  Its size is 4 times smaller than the first. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/145982/">https://habr.com/ru/post/145982/</a></p>
