All my experience of using these overwhelming capabilities of gadgets I divide into two parts: before the first application written for myself on the phone and after.  And after it became better. </p><br><p>  But even after this moment I never cease to be surprised.  This surprise was the use of <strong>Android-</strong> smartphone to solve the problem posed in this article.  Let's go back to her. </p><br><p>  Task "Publish theory".  In the usual format for this book is written.  Published and waiting for its reader.  But the world is changing.  Why not try to change this familiar process. </p><br><p>  Began to break the task into subtasks: </p><br><ol><li>  First, for writing a large amount of text with a complex structure, a special is needed.  program.  And now there are a lot of such programs, but, as always, we need a special one. </li><li>  Secondly, for reserving the work done, it would be good to throw created on the server.  After all, the server, I hope, is more reliable than a thin phone. </li><li>  Thirdly, there is a task to discuss the book with the reader and understand what points should be clarified. </li><li>  Fourth, there is a desire to dynamically complement the book. </li></ol><br><p>  The last desire arose from an assessment of its capabilities and the understanding that even a part that has already been written can be useful to many.  And when the remaining parts in hard work are completed, then you can print a book. </p><br><p>  We start to solve problems. </p><br><h2 id="markdown-epsilon-notes">  Markdown (Epsilon Notes) </h2><br><p>  The requirement for a text editing program was simple.  The text must be published in the internet.  And what format does our favorite <strong>Habr</strong> hold?  Right <strong>Markdown</strong> . </p><br><p>  And if the first article <strong>Habra</strong> I typed on the PC, where there have long been no problems with this format.  Now there is no PC nearby. </p><br><p>  The discovery was that programs with a full set of required functionality appeared on <strong>Android</strong> .  And let the authors of these programs express my respect.  For the first time in my experience, the <strong>Android</strong> application <strong>is</strong> so useful that without hesitation I listed a modest fee for the author‚Äôs work in exchange for a pro version.  But now is not about that. </p><br><p>  Not necessarily an absolutely universal option, but almost everything that suits me is <strong>Epsilon Notes</strong> . </p><br><p>  With her help, after work at night, I began to type letters.  Before it broke the book into two parts: theoretical calculations and explanations with examples of use.  The structure of the two books and the table of contents are the same, and the content is different. </p><br><p>  The book is theoretical: </p><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/4fc/bc8/21b/4fcbc821b966730ec8fbd53446705b15.jpg" alt="image" width="360"></div><br><p>  I also print it in pdf: </p><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/aee/84c/c46/aee84cc46a5cfbfbc6b508ccdb5beed0.jpg" alt="image" width="360"></div><br><p>  The book is practical.  For each chapter several articles are planned on Habr√© in the form of examples. </p><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f1c/578/3c0/f1c5783c0e55a661f686176ea013c604.jpg" alt="image" width="360"></div><br><p>  Preparation of the current article: </p><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/030/2b0/123/0302b0123a5dad17fe6f15f28d6f5b8e.jpg" alt="image" width="360"></div><br><h2 id="git-termux-bitbucket">  Git (Termux, bitbucket) </h2><br><p>  To implement the reservation, discussion and additions decided to use bitbucket.  I had a couple of private repositories there.  Zaregal new.  For the first time <strong>Markdown</strong> chose the language of development. </p><br><p>  It remains to find a <strong>git</strong> client on <strong>Android</strong> .  In fact, at that time I already had it.  But the process of his search still took place, but a little earlier.  In this area, specialized applications from the <em>google play market</em> do not yet provide the required set of features.  It is not surprising: the git client is important throughout its environment (with all its command utilities), and duplicating the behavior of such a complex command system in buttons and windows is not easy.  I was already upset. </p><br><p>  But <strong>Android</strong> already has excellent terminal emulators and Linux environments.  For example, <strong>Termux</strong> .  And in this emulator, the command client git is already very well loaded, native already. </p><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/3a2/3c6/13d/3a23c613da4e7c5742a2dd19a50b04b2.jpg" alt="image" width="360"></div><br><p>  <em>Voi la</em> , we are reserved and synchronized, and also, thanks to <em>Issues</em> from <em>bitbucket</em> , feedback has appeared with the reader. </p><br><p>  <em>Bitbucket</em> storage for a booklet: </p><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/3fa/960/d5f/3fa960d5f9df901fcf16f65ab3842174.jpg" alt="image" width="360"></div><br><p>  The history of the change of the book in the printed pdf: </p><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/087/4c1/c21/0874c1c2155cd50f4ccb64697b569570.jpg" alt="image" width="360"></div><br><p>  Feedback from the reader: </p><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/36b/c37/ad6/36bc37ad6bb1ddcbd7f8bf3be9b345c8.jpg" alt="image" width="360"></div><br><p>  Place for drafts and published articles for <strong>Habr</strong> </p><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/85d/95f/a7b/85d95fa7bc6eb1b17fb7ba471fb05955.jpg" alt="image" width="360"></div><br><h2 id="itogo">  Total </h2><br><p>  The tasks are solved in full.  Well, the solution to the global problem will only work and time. </p><br><p>  Thanks for attention. </p><br><p>  Sorry for typing errors.  I'll get to the PC - I'll correct the typos. </p><br><p>  As a small aperitif to the articles that are planned for writing, I will give the current version of the introduction from the book.  Suddenly anyone interested. </p><br><h2 id="vvedenie-v-knigu">  Introduction to the book </h2><br><p>  We formulate the purpose of the work on this book.  And the work is not only mine, but also the work of the reader. </p><br><p>  The goal is to introduce definitions based on simple axioms for the concepts of <strong>Consciousness</strong> and <strong>Life</strong> . </p><br><p>  It sounds ambitious, but without a good instrument.  Such a tool will be the "General Theory of Algorithms", which was already partially worked out in the process of writing this book. </p><br><p> The theory is still scientifically <strong>weak</strong> , and there are few examples of its practical use.  Further, under the spoiler, her starting concepts, which she cited here with only one purpose: to find a companion for a separate discussion of the book with the subsequent inclusion of all the interlocutors in the co-authors.  Like the development of open source software projects. </p><br><p>  If anyone is interested, I will be glad. </p><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Hidden text</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><p>  The introduction of the definition of the <strong>algorithm</strong> , which, being determined by the method indicated below, made it possible to disassemble the warehouse of knowledge accumulated by man according to accurate ‚Äúshelves‚Äù was very important for the emergence of this theory. </p><br><p>  So.  Get acquainted. </p><br><p>  <strong><u>The algorithm</u></strong> is a characteristic of space, which is a significant (controlled, effective, repeatable) <strong><u>way of</u></strong> its transformation. </p><br><p>  It is necessary to get used to this definition, because with it a lot of work is necessary. </p><br><p>  But here in the introduction it is necessary not to scare away the work, but to attract attention.  Therefore, I will make the announcement of the currently reviewed conceptual horizon. </p><br><p>  <strong><u>Consciousness</u></strong> is the ability to <strong><u>quickly</u></strong> <strong>synthesize a</strong> new <strong>algorithm</strong> using a <strong>language by</strong> transforming an existing <strong>algorithm</strong> . </p><br><p>  <strong><u>Life</u></strong> is a spontaneous accumulation <strong>of</strong> space <strong>algorithms</strong> in the <em>structural</em> <em>objects of</em> this space. </p><br><p>  <u><strong>Language</strong></u> is a complex system consisting of: </p><br><ul><li>  <em>communication</em> group of <strong>evolvers</strong> ("native speakers"), providing the procedure for the <em>preservation</em> and development of macro- <strong>signals</strong> and their processing <strong>chains</strong> , </li><li>  procedures for creating <em>virtual</em> <strong>symbols</strong> in the process of <em>communication</em> , </li><li>  procedures for gaining experience (ie building <em>useful</em> <strong>chains</strong> ) through the use of <em>communication</em> .  That is the procedure of <em>virtualization of</em> accumulation of experience. </li></ul><br><p>  <u><strong>Consciousness</strong></u> is the process of using a <strong>language</strong> without attracting a second <strong>evolver</strong> .  That is, one <strong>evolver</strong> in the process of <em>communication</em> itself forms a macro <strong>signal</strong> and then receives it itself. </p><br><p>  It is also worth saying that working with these and other concepts cited later in the book turned out to be useful not only for the sake of the appearance of these definitions.  In the process of analysis, several very useful <em>laws of</em> our space were found, which are implicitly used in all branches of modern science and in the design and development of the architecture of large systems.  The formal record of these patterns can increase the efficiency of labor in these and many other areas. </p><br><p>  Rereading the introduction again. <br>  Too ambitious. <br>  But it is well said: "The road will be mastered by the one who goes." </p><br><p>  <strong>Let's get started</strong> </p><br><p>  And now for sure.  Thanks for attention. </p></div></div><br><p>  Practical wiki: <a href="https://bitbucket.org/aibor/ai_borisov_cit/wiki/Home">General Theory of Algorithms (bitbucket.org)</a> <br>  Bug tracking system: <a href="https://bitbucket.org/aibor/ai_borisov_cit/issues">Issues (bitbucket.org)</a> </p><br><h2 id="otzyvy">  Reviews </h2><br><p>  Thank you very much for the feedback.  Talking with you is very helpful. </p><br><p>  If this does not complicate, you can ask to transfer the discussion of the book to the platform proposed in the article (Issues).  I did not plan to load my favorite Habr with theoretical discussions, I wanted to leave only practice here.  Thanks again in advance. </p><br><p>  Thanks for the criticism.  Indeed, the article on Habr√© is not the place to search for acquaintances and those who test the theory of others. </p><br><p>  In the following articles, if the community allows me to publish positive karma, there will be no theoretical calculations.  Only useful practical application of this theory. </p><br><p>  I am waiting for individual critical reviews on the presented technology (a project of open theory development).  The word "General" in the name of the theory is used to emphasize the fact of using this technology. </p><br><p>  Sincerely. </p></div>
