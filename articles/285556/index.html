Although I am only a little over 30, I suggest you broaden your horizons a little and maybe reconsider something in your life. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/68a/a4e/954/68aa4e954c0754d6b23e3e41932e6e84.jpg"><br><br>  In my article I want to tell you that old age is not a disease, but a period of an even more active period of life, and I will give instructions from Vladimir Yakovlev what to do if you decide not to age.

      Yes, yes, it was you who decided, because you are aging precisely because you expect it. <br><br>  And the main bonus is that you can increase the productive period of life by 2 times, and with a decent 30 years more (!) Or more.  Those.  in 60 years you will have 35-40 years of productive life, and here I will tell you how to keep this productivity up to 90 years or more.  Interesting? <br><br><h4>  <b>Attention!</b>  <b>The age limit is 30+, your mind may suffer.</b> <b><br></b>  <b>Read the post at your own risk!</b> </h4><br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  At the level of my age, I did not think that there were any further global problems to be solved.  Having visited the report of Vladimir Yakovlev, I looked at this problem in a new way.  He did a great job of finding answers, how to live a full life after 60. Is there any pattern among those who are constantly tormented and dying from diseases and those who lead an active lifestyle and die from old age? <br><br>  So, there is no dependence on where you live and genetic predisposition.  There is a standard set of rules followed by absolutely all people living happily ever after. <br><br>  So, I will use the list of rules and give along the description my comments adapting the text to our reality and subject area. <br><br><h4>  1. Lifestyle - you must not stop working, and be sure to live off the results of this work.  Here, a prerequisite - do what you like. </h4><br><br>  With age, the speed of memory and thinking does not decrease, but increases, if you continue to use them.  I think that all IT specialists from the very beginning of their careers are engaged in their favorite thing.  When I started my career, such a phrase was popular ‚Äúyou sit on the Internet all day, and you still get paid for it.‚Äù  Build your career on the basis of their interests, and not following the fashion.  If you can not become a manager - do not become him, I really ask you.  Remember our Soviet cartoons, for example, Dunno.  Everyone has their own role in this cartoon, there are no people, everyone does something useful for others.  This is the essence - to be unique, to be yourself. <br><br><h4>  2. Health </h4><br><br>  Discard the stereotypes of aging.  To grow old is not to be ill. <br><br>  Diet: None of the long-livers are on a diet, the main thing is ‚Äúto eat to live, not vice versa.‚Äù <br><br>  Wellness practices.  We need physical training for endurance for at least one hour every (!) Day.  It can be dancing, running, cycling, swimming, etc.  Here, it is important to exercise endurance, where it requires not a sprint throw from you, but the ability to relax in the course of loading and to strain just the right muscles. <br><br><h4>  3. Attitude to life.  Ability to accept what is happening. </h4><br><br>  You need to live in two sectors: <br><br>  A. Here and now - minute by minute.  Do not look beyond a minute, for a minute something beyond the unexpected cannot happen and you should not worry about it.  There is no future, the past is no longer.  Take care that you are doing everything possible right now.  Give up the management of the short-term future, which you can calculate.  The central processor (the brain in the common people) as much as possible work out only the current moment in the next 5 minutes, then you need only a sketch of the path, and in the process of the path you are happy to accept all the changes. <br><br>  B. Build long-range plans, form positive expectations from life.  How to understand that the plan is far enough?  If your CPU, you can not rationally decompose action by action from the current place to the goal.  When you do not understand how such a goal can be achieved and there is an ideal distance.  The goal should be one in which you are comfortable and you really need it. <br><br>  And at the same time, abandon the past.  It has already happened, and you always do your best.  There is no right and wrong event - it is only you who paint it so.  It‚Äôs like driving a car and turning right only - it‚Äôs impossible, you‚Äôll never come home.  Take all the changes with pleasure, love yourself - change is a natural process.  ‚ÄúGo and trust in God,‚Äù says the Bible. <br><br><h4>  4. Four adoption </h4><br><br><h5>  4.1 adopt the next stage of development </h5><br><br>  Fear is born when there is a lot of thought and little action.  Continue movement and actions, then there will be no fear and fear of change.  Be ready for change, expect a positive outcome and be ready for it.  The weather will inevitably change, everything around will change.  Make the right changes, they are always positive.  If everything changes, then you can accelerate this process in the direction you need.  You do not like it?  So you are afraid of change.  Change this habit. <br><br><h5>  4.2 health depends on us </h5><br><br>  Nobody will do it for you - sports, dancing, movement and everything - with pleasure.  There is no magic here, the usual everyday work on your body.  You have to use it, do not use everything than it does - it turns off. <br><br><h5>  4.3 have fun when you are on your own </h5><br><br>  Loneliness and solitude is different in which side is the key.  Do not seek truth, God, higher consciousness somewhere outside.  Everything you need is inside you.  ‚ÄúThe kingdom of God will not come explicitly, no one will say here it is here or there.  The kingdom of God is within you, ‚Äùis a quote from the Bible.  Learn to be an absolutely positive person, everything in the world is happening for you so that you feel good. <br><br><h5>  4.4 do for yourself and not for others </h5><br><br>  Whatever you do, you should do it for your own pleasure.  You should want to do this, regardless of whether you get money for it or not.  It is very important to do what other people need, not necessarily to earn money from it.  This may be volunteering or charity.  If you can earn income from this, it is just great. <br><br>  From the statistics: on 04/04/2013 on the website hh.ru in the active search 2,349 people over 60 years old, who posted their resume, and only half from Moscow.  As a rule, these are very skilled personnel, or very good workers. <br><br>  Another interesting thing is the TOP 10 professional fields where these people work: <br>  1. Construction - 116 <br>  2. Production - 96 <br>  3. Admin.  staff - 62 <br>  4. Top management - 55 <br>  5. Accounting - 30 <br>  6. Transportation - 28 <br>  7. Science, education - 27 <br>  8. Sales - 26 <br>  9. Art, media - 24 <br>  10. IT, telecom - 17 <br><br>  Vacancies for pensioners are very few.  For employers, I would recommend paying more attention to such people.  It seems to me that their real potential is now greatly undervalued.  I think that it is not necessary to explain to anyone that pensioners from the Ministry of Internal Affairs, and especially from the FSB, are already employed long before their resignation. <br><br>  I hope, I opened for you what you have not even thought about.  But now you know, and I hope that now there will be more good specialists and experts who don‚Äôt want to go into management because of fashion and stereotypes, but only if you really cannot live without it, literally. <br><br>  Now, if you do everything right in advance, then increase the chance for an additional 20-30 years of super interesting life!  All in your hands. <br><br>  I wish you success! <br><br>  Thank you for reading to the end.  Specially for you bonus.  as an example of what people can do: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/af7/311/6a2/af73116a283ec67c757515922db3a8bd.jpeg"><br><br>  81-year-old Englishman David Latimer created the world.  He did it like this - put seed in a bottle, watered and corked tightly.  For more than 40 years, the miniature world of Latimera has been developing in a corked bottle.  And it feels great. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/285556/">https://habr.com/ru/post/285556/</a></p>
