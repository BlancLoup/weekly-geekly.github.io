When the model changes, the view changes immediately.  I would like to manage the architecture properly.  Ideally, the solution has been used by many large companies for non-trivial applications.  Since I can get something complicated, I would like to see an active community around the framework, which you can always try to ask not too simple questions ( <i>Marionette, Chaplin, Aura, Thorax</i> ).  Ideal to also have build tools ( <i>grunt-bbb, brunch</i> ).  Use <font color="aa5522"><b>Backbone.js</b></font> .

      <b>I want the</b> foundation of desktop applications for the web.  This framework must be high-level, modular, MVC, without the need to put everything together manually, maintain persistence (fixed objects with file metaphor, devices), calculated properties and auto-update of templates.  This is necessary for intelligent state management instead of manual configuration, compatibility with many adjacent frameworks.  This should be with good documentation, use templates, build tools ( <i>ember.gem, ember for brunch</i> ).  Use <font color="aa5522"><b>Ember.js</b></font> . <br><br>  <b>I want</b> something lightweight, with templates connected on the fly, navigation, integration with main libraries (such as <i>jQuery</i> and <i>Dojo</i> ) and fast, with support for MVC component inheritance, which may not yet be done on large applications, but it should be.  Ideal if done by people with experience creating complex applications.  Use <font color="aa5522"><b>CanJS</b></font> . <br><br>  <b>I want</b> a declarative style wrapper that uses View to collect data about user behavior through customizing HTML and components according to the rules of the application.  With simple test system support, URL navigation and task sharing via MVC or its variant.  This gives a customized approach to adjacent libraries that compile HTML in order to build your own <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259F%25D1%2580%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B4%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B5%25D1%2582%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BE-%25D0%25BE%25D1%2580%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD%25D1%2582%25D0%25B8%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BD%25D1%258B%25D0%25B9_%25D1%258F%25D0%25B7%25D1%258B%25D0%25BA_%25D0%25BF%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B3%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BC%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B8%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D1%258F" title="Domain-specific language">DSL</a> (domain-specific language) in HTML.  This is necessary for such elements of the network platform as web components;  and still need to have assembly tools ( <i>angular-seed</i> ).  Use <font color="aa5522"><b>AngularJS</b></font> . <br><br>  <b>I want a</b> good basis for large-scale applications, with a proven and tested infrastructure of widgets, modules with post-loading;  possibly with asynchronous and simple integration with CDNs, with a choice of modules and widgets (graphs, charts, tables, etc.), with good multilingualism (i18n, l10n).  We need support for OOP, MVC and a block builder (modules) to create complex architectures.  Use <font color="aa5522"><b>Dojo</b></font> . <br><br>  <b>I want</b> something optimized for working with <i>YUI</i> extensions.  With support for models, views and navigation, which would make it easy to write an application with different ways to display information, with transitions of display options from one to another and the like.  It is a complete solution with widgets / components, with the ability to describe the architecture of the application.  There may be build tools ( <i>yuiproject</i> ), but with possible replacement with others.  Use <font color="aa5522"><b>YUI</b></font> . <br><br>  <b>I want</b> something simple for asynchronous interfaces and not having dependencies, flexible when building an application, with MVC support, events, navigation, while remaining compact.  Optimized for CoffeeScript, with detailed documentation.  Use <font color="aa5522"><b>Spine</b></font> . <br><br>  <b>I want a</b> tool to build complex dynamic UI based on a data model and a declarative binding style.  For UI updates with model changes, using bidirectional binding and dependency support through data tracking.  I should be able to use it with any framework or even with a ready-made application.  You need to have built-in templating and easy extensibility.  Use <font color="aa5522"><b>KnockoutJS</b></font> . <br><br>  <b>I want</b> something for simple web applications and sites.  I do not expect to have a lot of code there, so it will not interfere much.  Crossbrowser to focus on the task.  Easy event handling, interaction with remote services, extensibility and a huge set of plug-ins.  Use <font color="aa5522"><b>jQuery</b></font> . <br><br><h3>  ‚ñ† What do developers think about the most popular frameworks? </h3><br>  As part of the study on MV * frameworks for TodoMVC and this article, we conducted a survey among developers.  What framework do they use more often, and most importantly, why would they recommend it?  What will they feel if this framework was not in the project? <br><br>  Here are some of the most interesting answers: <br><br>  <b>Ember.js</b> <br><br>  <font color="#448811">‚ÄúFor‚Äù</font> : the combination of live templates and related (observable) objects has changed the way that JavaScript is handled.  At first it may seem a little confused, but you finish the work with a good division of responsibility in the code.  I found that once everything is described in me, adding quite complex features takes a couple of lines.  Without <i>Ember,</i> these same features would be hellishly complex to implement. <br><br>  <font color="#aa5522">"Against"</font> : <i>Ember</i> , after all, should reach version 1.0.  Many things are still in motion, such as a router and <i>Ember data</i> .  The new website is very useful, but there is no such documentation for <i>Ember</i> like other frameworks, especially <i>Backbone</i> .  With so much magic in the framework, it's a bit scary.  If something breaks, you can't figure out exactly why.  Yes, and error messages in <i>Ember</i> are often inaccurate. <br><br>  <font color="#448811">‚ÄúFor‚Äù</font> : key factors: <br>  a) Features that allow me to avoid masses of template code (bindings, computed properties, presentation layer with good control). <br>  b) development team.  I am a rubist and I know what Yehuda Katz is worth.  I trust the guy =). <br><br>  <font color="#aa5522">‚ÄúAgainst‚Äù</font> : documentation.  It is really sad that <i>Ember</i> does not have good documentation, training programs, screencasts like <i>Backbone, Angular,</i> or other frameworks.  Right now we are reviewing the code, looking for documentation that is not perfect. <br><br>  <font color="#448811">Pro</font> : configuration agreement.  <i>Ember</i> takes a lot of small work for you;  this is by far the easiest way to build an application on the client side these days. <br><br>  <font color="#aa5522">"Against"</font> : the threshold of learning.  The lack of a mass of tutorials for beginners that exist for other frameworks like <i>Backbone</i> is partly due to the small community, but I think it‚Äôs more because of the code mobility in preparation for version 1.0. <br><br>  <font color="#448811">‚ÄúFor‚Äù</font> : ease of binding, tight integration with management, easy modularity in my own code. <br><br>  <font color="#aa5522">‚ÄúAgainst‚Äù</font> : I would like to have a stable integration with <i>Ember data</i> and integrated support for localStorage, synchronized with the REST API - all these are false dreams. <br><br>  <b>Backbone.js</b> <br><br>  <font color="#448811">‚ÄúFor‚Äù</font> : simplicity - only 4 main components (Collection, Model, Presentation, Router).  A huge community (ecosystem) and many solutions on StackOverflow.  Higher order frameworks like <i>Marionette</i> or <i>Vertebrae</i> - with a lot of smart code inside.  Someone likes ‚Äúlow level‚Äù - you need to write a lot of sample code, but get the architecture made for yourself. <br><br>  <font color="#aa5522">Con</font> : I do not like inheritance - the content of the parent object is copied to a new one.  You need prototype inheritance.  Sometimes I don‚Äôt read ‚Äúreal world scenarios‚Äù in examples from docks.  You have to do a lot of research after reading the tutorial with TODO to figure out how to build a slightly more complex application. <br><br>  I do not use official <a href="http://addyosmani.com/writing-modular-js/" title="Asynchronous Module Definition">AMD</a> support in DocumentCloud projects ( <i>Backbone, Underscore</i> ) [but this is not a problem with the new shim () method in <i>RequireJS 2.0</i> ]. <br><br>  <font color="#448811">‚ÄúFor‚Äù</font> : after the initial puzzling study of the work of <i>Backbone,</i> all of this is extremely practical.  Practicality - in a well maintained, lightweight and constantly updated library in the right environment.  Friendly support for <i>Underscore, jQuery / Zepto</i> , the tools that most projects from my studio would work with. <br><br>  <font color="#aa5522">"Against"</font> : the number of tutorials on how to work with <i>Backbone</i> is different for different versions.  I asked other developers to take a look at <i>Backbone</i> , and they would write code for version 0.3.  Unconsciously.  While there are no problems, <i>Backbone</i> can fix it, but this is perhaps the main inconvenience associated with it. <br><br>  Theoretically, the same can be said about anything, but with <i>Backbone</i> it periodically repeats before my eyes.  Hell, I even saw an article a month ago, which uses ancient methods and techniques. <br><br>  Regardless of my attitude to the framework, it is this problem that could be corrected by the community with reasonable edits and approaches.  For me, <i>Backbone</i> deserves respect, because of community support. <br><br>  <font color="#448811">‚ÄúFor‚Äù</font> : provides only minimal abstraction without unreasonable restrictions - it gives the opportunity to assemble a project according to needs. <br><br>  <font color="#aa5522">Con</font> : I would rewrite or delete <i>Backbone.sync</i> .  It is built for the HTTP protocol and does not adapt well to the features of WebSocket. <br><br>  <font color="#448811">Pro</font> : Extremely easy to get started, offers a good familiarization path.  It is relatively well customized, and there are tons of other people using it who can help. <br><br>  <font color="#aa5522">Cons</font> : the fact that there is no default view binding (although you can set it).  Updating an entire view when a single property changes is uneconomical. <br><br>  The REST API has many advantages, but there are difficulties with a large number of entries (admittedly, the problem with REST is its own, but still remains) and unpleasant problems in obtaining various URI schemes for working with various types of operations. <br><br>  <b>AngularJS</b> <br><br>  <font color="#448811">‚ÄúFor‚Äù</font> : <br>  a) Bidirectional data binding is a very strong approach.  You think more about your model and condition instead of organizing a series of events.  The model is the only source of truth. <br>  b) Speed.  <i>AngularJS is</i> easy to download.  It templates by building nodes instead of innerHTML, which, in theory, is more productive. <br>  c) If you are guided by modern browsers and / or are quite frugal, you can do without jQuery. <br><br>  <font color="#aa5522">Cons</font> : I would like to be able to specify UI state transitions that are changed by the model.  Namely, items using <i>ng-show / ng-hide</i> , I would like to hide or minimize a simple declaration. <br><br>  <font color="#448811">Pro</font> : He is very intuitive, with excellent documentation.  I like their data binding approach, HTML, based on Views, nested environments (scopes).  I went from <i>Backbone / Thorax</i> to <i>Angular</i> and never looked back.  A new extension (addon) Chrome <i>Batarang</i> integrates with <i>Chrome Developer's Tools</i> and provides real-time access to <i>Angular</i> data structures. <br><br>  <font color="#aa5522">Cons</font> : I would like to have built-in support for functions like drag-n-drop, but this can be added through external components available on GitHub.  I would like to see more third-party components suitable for reuse.  I think it is only a matter of time for the ecosystem around <i>AngularJS</i> to become more mature, and then they will be available and diverse, as in communities like <i>jQuery</i> . <br><br>  <font color="#448811">‚ÄúFor‚Äù</font> : It drastically reduces the template code, allows you to reuse the code through components, extends the HTML syntax so that many complex features become as simple as writing attributes in HTML, and are extremely easy to test thanks to the complete description of dependencies. <br>  You can write a non-trivial application without <i>jQuery</i> , without directly managing the DOM.  To make such a tool is a real skill. <br><br>  <font color="#aa5522">‚ÄúAgainst‚Äù</font> : its threshold of learning is somewhat higher than that of <i>Backbone</i> (which is very easy for the master), but the result is worth it.  Documentation could be better. <br><br>  <b>Knockoutjs</b> <br><br>  <font color="#448811">Pro</font> : I don't always use it, but <i>KnockoutJS is</i> great for single-page apps.  Very easy subscription to changes of objects;  Much better API for the so-called <i>Backbone</i> ‚Äúcollection views‚Äù, using observable arrays.  And user events on observed objects for effects, etc. <br><br>  <font color="#aa5522">"Against"</font> : it is felt that the API is difficult to expand;  I would probably prefer to choose <i>Backbone</i> on large applications (also because of community support). <br><br>  <font color="#448811">Pros</font> : I like the data binding mechanism and its convenient use.  I especially like the way the templates were replaced by binding control logic. <br><br>  <font color="#aa5522">Cons</font> : It‚Äôs bad that there is no best practice guide with the structure of the application.  In addition to having a View Model, the framework does not help you in describing a well-structured View Model.  This will end very easily with a large unmanaged feature. <br><br>  <b>Dojo</b> <br><br>  <i>Pro</i> : syntactically - <i>Dojo is</i> very simple.  This is good for dynamic and stable builds, with a loader's initial file, usually 6 KB in size.  It is AMD-compatible (post-loadable), which makes it very compact, and comes out of the box with a ton of extensions, from basic work with DOM to complex SVG, VML and canvas.  The widget system <i>Dijit is</i> great in ease of use and ability to expand.  This is a very well-chosen and complete set of tools. <br><br>  <font color="#aa5522">Cons</font> : dojo / _base / declare functionality is not a 100% rigorous managed tool, now there are some overlays due to backward compatibility, although this will mostly be fixed in <i>Dojo 2.0</i> . <br><br>  <font color="#448811">‚ÄúFor‚Äù</font> : good components: tabs, tables for data, form manager ... Equally for all browsers.  Working AMD.  Easy tests with data simulators.  It integrates well with other frameworks thanks to AMD (I will integrate with <i>JMVC</i> ). <br><br>  <font color="#aa5522">Cons</font> : The project is configured by default for out-of-fashion components.  Not fully html5.  Documentation is so-so.  Bad templating system (no binding on the fly). <br><br>  <b>YUI</b> <br><br>  <font color="#448811">‚ÄúFor‚Äù</font> : <i>YUI3</i> is a modular and ‚Äúdo-what-want‚Äù type of component library that includes all the advantages of Backbone and even more.  In my opinion, it even improves some concepts of Backbone by sharing some things (for example, an attribute is a separate module that can be mixed into any object - the ‚Äúmodule‚Äù of an event can also be mixed). <br><br>  <i>Con</i> : I would like to see that <i>YUI3</i> supports wiring from <i>Ember</i> .  I think this is a really great achievement for <i>Ember</i> ;  otherwise, I see <i>YUI3 as an</i> excellent component library where you can find what you need.  I want to see improved AMD compatibility of the module loader.  It works well today, but it would be better if I could start new projects on AMD modules and insert into third-party <i>YUI3</i> components and other things that AMD also uses. <br><br>  <b>JavascriptMVC</b> <br><br>  Pro: It has all the tools out of the box, all that remains is to run the commands and start the build.  I used 6 months and it was really good. <br><br>  <font color="#aa5522">‚ÄúAgainst‚Äù</font> : the only thing I would like to see is the acceleration of the development of the next version.  The developers know about the problems and solve them, but the process could be different - not months for some problems that I want to fix and send a solution - then I could make a patch and pull-request. <br><br>  <b>Maria</b> <br><br>  <font color="#448811">Pro</font> : Since <i>Maria</i> is a pure MVC implementation framework, it focuses on being an MVC framework.  No more and no less.  Everything is strict and simple. <br><br>  <font color="#aa5522">‚ÄúAgainst‚Äù</font> : a bit more documentation than what is written in the source code, plus a few test cases.  A tutorial showing the basics of Maria‚Äôs real MVC usage would not hurt. <br><br>  <b>Cujo.js</b> <br><br>  <font color="#448811">Pros</font> : For real-world applications, MV * out of the box is almost never enough, and the most important toolkit is often outside the box.  With <i>cujo.js</i> , you define a box. <br><br>  Yes, <i>cujo.js</i> has high-level MV * -like features for creating Views, models, controllers, etc., but each application is different, and no framework can be a 100% solution.  Instead of trying to please everyone, <i>cujo.js</i> also includes low-level tools, architecture settings and a rich plugin system that can even combine and extend other MV * frameworks. <br><br>  Create the architecture best suited for your application, instead of laying the application in the framework of someone else's architecture. <br><br>  <font color="#aa5522">‚ÄúAgainst‚Äù</font> : the broad masses of javascriptors are completely unprepared and not trained in the development of large-scale applications.  Most of them do not even know about the existence of design patterns and architectures. <br><br>  Since <i>cujo.js is</i> so different from others, it needs something more than just referring to the API and code examples.  Without tutorials, educational materials, and developing examples, <i>cujo.js</i> will look weird and depressing for the un-minded eye, but documentation is expected soon. <br><br>  <b>Extjs</b> <br><br>  <i>Pro</i> : I think <i>ExtJS</i> works best with <i>Ext Designer</i> .  It separates itself from other GUI frameworks, allowing non-programmers to design UIs, and programmers fill in the blanks.  Comparison with <i>Backbone</i> type MVC frameworks is, in my opinion, illegal: the power of <i>ExtJS</i> is in creating a rich GUI, and not lightweight web applications. <br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">For commercial, remote office, rich-applications, I think that </font></font><i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">ExtJS</font></font></i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> remains the best choice when it comes to JavaScript solutions (except </font></font><i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">GWT</font></font></i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> , etc.). For public web applications, I have something else that gives me more control over markup (and ideally fulfilling greaceful degradation). </font></font><br><br> <font color="#aa5522"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">‚ÄúAgainst‚Äù</font></font></font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> : it has a high threshold of entry, above many other modern structural (structural) frameworks. It can be said that if they invest in </font></font><i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">ExtJS</font></font></i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> for long-term development, the time to study will pay off, but I think that solutions like this should strive to minimize the team's training time. </font></font><br><br> <font color="#448811"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">‚ÄúFor‚Äù</font></font></font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> : I think that the special property of </font></font><i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">ExtJS 4</font></font></i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- that he throws you into MVC concepts and the required file structure right off the bat. The initial tutorials of </font></font><i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Dojo</font></font></i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> speak mostly about improving existing sites, and </font></font><i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">ExtJS</font></font></i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> assumes that you are starting a site from scratch. </font></font><br><br> <i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">ExtJS</font></font></i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> doesn‚Äôt really show that you are dealing with HTML. The component library is rich enough to work for a long time without touching HTML when building the application. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It would be interesting to see how this fits together if web components are more fully supported. This finally would allow the DOM to be managed without fear of breaking widgets or having to become inconsistent with the internal state of your application. </font></font><br><br> <font color="#aa5522"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">"vs"</font></font></font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">: licensing is considered restrictive and difficult to understand by some. More people would invest in </font></font><i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">ExtJS</font></font></i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> if it were clearer what the deposit was and what the long-term costs would be when it was used. There are no such problems with some other structural tools, but this is probably not a cause for concern in a large business environment. </font></font><br><br> <font color="#448811"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">‚ÄúFor‚Äù</font></font></font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> : </font></font><i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">ExtJS</font></font></i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> is a fantastic package for quickly building an RIA for an intranet. I, for example, like to write with HTML and JavaScript, and for me there is a great satisfaction to dig at this level. Although </font></font><i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">ExtJS</font></font></i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> makes you feel that you are not working with HTML, it still gives you a lot of control over the document, especially when creating a complex UI. </font></font><br><br> <font color="#aa5522"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">"vs"</font></font></font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">: Nevertheless ... I completely agree that this is a very heavy shell, and I do not think that I will recommend it for frondend on the web. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">My biggest complaint about the package is that it is a big headache for tests than I could imagine. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Our tester ended up switching to </font></font><i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Sikuli</font></font></i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> , because trying to work at </font></font><i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Selenium</font></font></i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> became too big a battle. </font></font><br><br> <b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Batman </font></font></b> <br><br> <font color="#448811"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">‚Äúfor‚Äù</font></font></font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> : he has a large and convenient system for viewing bindings. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Games with Rails are very enjoyable and these are all configuration requirements. </font></font><br><br> <font color="#aa5522"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Cons</font></font></font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> : Documentation could be much better, and I feel that Shopify will not add new features, although they say they will.</font></font><br><br><h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> ‚ñ† Do not be afraid to experiment </font></font></h3><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Although the developer is unlikely to learn how to use more of this handful, I‚Äôll support the study of frameworks that you don‚Äôt know. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">There is a cart (with a small trolley) of interesting facts and techniques that can be learned between times. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I had a case: I found that </font></font><i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Batman.js</font></font></i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> requires a minimum of self-written code in the implementation. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I am not a constant CoffeeScript-box or a user of </font></font><i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Batman.js</font></font></i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> , but the result gave me some food for thought. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It is possible that I will be able to take some of the source of the tool and use it myself. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Or, perhaps, in the future project, I just use </font></font><i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Batman.js</font></font></i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> when it is overgrown with community and support.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> Regardless of whether you use what you see and build in a day, you will get more knowledge about what is there and how to work with it. </font></font><br><br><h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> ‚ñ† Going beyond MV * concepts </font></font></h3><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Although the MV * family of patterns is very popular for structuring an application, they are limited in that there is no difference in the types of application layers, the connection between different Views, no services that perform work or anything else. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Developers may have to explore other patterns. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">We turned to developers who went further MVC, penetrated into the essence of the requirements with their own patterns or extensions of the existing one.</font></font><br><br><blockquote>      .  ,     <i>Backbone</i> ,     ,      .        <i>Backbone</i> (, ),      .        <i>Initializer</i> .

A variety of frameworks help innovate results, and a lot of similar tools only create noise. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Projects like TodoMVC help narrow the selection of tools to the most interesting or convenient for a particular project. Remember that it is not necessary to rush to a choice, do not feel forced, choose what best suits your needs. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Experimenting with frameworks will introduce you to ways to solve common problems that will help you program better.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Thanks to my colleague, a member of the TodoMVC team Sindre Sorhus for his help with the corrections and proofreading of this article. </font></font><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ff6/86d/065/ff686d065fa2fdc2af737a70785f21ab.jpg" align="left"> <i><font color="#999999"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Author:</font></font></font></i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> Addy Osmani is a development engineer on the Chrome team at Google. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">A passionate JavaScript developer, he wrote books with a free distribution license: ‚Äú </font></font><a href="http://addyosmani.com/resources/essentialjsdesignpatterns/book/"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Exploring JavaScript Design Patterns</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> ‚Äù and ‚Äú </font><a href=""><i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Backbone</font></i></a></font><a href=""><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> Application Development,</font></font><i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"></font></i></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> ‚Äù and participated in the development of the open source projects </font></font><i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Modernizr</font></font></i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> and </font></font><i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">JQuery</font></font></i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> . </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">He is currently working on </font></font><i><a href="http://yeoman.io/"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Yeoman</font></font></a></i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> , an original workflow for creating attractive applications.</font></font></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/149872/">https://habr.com/ru/post/149872/</a></p>
