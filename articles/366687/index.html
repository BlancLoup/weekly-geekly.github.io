Part Three: Mobile Era</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  It seems that this year the world finally woke up and realized that the future of the gaming industry is in mobile games.  More and more publications publish articles with tons of statistics and tell in which direction the mobile gaming industry will move. <br><br>  Mobile marketing is one of the most popular topics for discussion.  In the Super Bowl advertising race, gaming media predicted victory for the Game of War trailer and sexy Kate Upton.  But it seems that the love of the audience won the old man Liam Neeson and Clash of Clans.  Although Game of War still leads in the top downloads on the App Store.  So on what to bet in 2015 - sex appeal or recognition?  What will be the advertising of mobile games in the next couple of years? <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/35b/08e/de6/35b08ede6c084a289cffc9c7d18c6698.jpg"><br><a name="habracut"></a>

      In the 2000s, an important event for the industry took place: the games became mobile.  That is, yes, portable consoles have existed in prehistoric times (since the early 70s of the last century). <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/6g6Ky4SIdyg%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700022,15700186,15700190,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhgXncYZvrayE63PR_4jltMMotJpEQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  But such devices were created exclusively for entertainment and were focused mainly on children (not counting Asia, where gaming culture had a great influence on people of all ages). <br><br><iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/7WpIRAEfnrg%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700022,15700186,15700190,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhjylkEjGrFFD--gLaOJgkZNyFmVJQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  With the advent of mobile phones, anyone could play.  The first mobile games - Tetris or Snake - were pre-installed on mobile devices by the manufacturer.  Technologies developed rapidly - and soon the games could already be bought from mobile operators.  Increased screen size, functionality, increased sound quality and color reproduction. <br><br>  The fashion for mobile games covered Japan in the early 2000s.  At that time, while in the West they were still playing "Snake", Japanese gamers were already familiar with high-quality 3D graphics, fingerprint recognition technologies and choosing between a large number of games of different genres. <br><br>  The first mobile game trailers were short and often showed gameplay. <br><br><iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZjdYoJFQn6k%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700022,15700186,15700190,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhinKDiGIfe8lfK0LwvECqnvNZv9gQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  Although some people tried to create small cinematics: <br><br><iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/upaPqlvNJYk%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700022,15700186,15700190,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhic0Y8fyHxuoqPidEGBhQ-W3mq1Sg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  Large companies, entrenched in the video game market, very quickly realized the viability of the mobile market.  So, in 2004, the EA Mobile studio was founded, and in 2005, the guys from Relude received a round of investments and changed their name to Rovio Mobile. <br><br><iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/XEbUMGnUa2A%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700022,15700186,15700190,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhjl5EsM_C1PKWt4t7WmSWG3bMe19A" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  In the first decade of the new century, mobile game trailers were not a common or effective form of advertising.  At that time, other marketing tools such as advertising in the press, SMS mailings or banners worked much more efficiently.  Small development teams could not boast of the same impressive videos that the creators of console games could afford, so it was very difficult to fight for the attention of users. <br><br>  Today we are at the stage of technological development, when the mobile market has long left the console market behind.  A wide audience, availability, relatively low development costs, constant improvement of mobile devices - all this has made mobile games a new trend. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/mLXg7axMxnk%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700022,15700186,15700190,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhif54ZwYGUTr594sp7RjrcGojix0g" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  Large companies that entered the mobile market 5-10 years ago, gained primacy in the most promising and profitable gaming industry.  The rest of the developers are desperately trying to get into the outgoing train of the mobile industry. <br><br>  An increasing number of games are coming out in parallel both on consoles / PCs and on mobile devices. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/lB4gAcLZTGQ%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700022,15700186,15700190,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhiXFY82ajRzXw-FOTA1COwJlLSikg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  Mobile advertising in a hurry goes the way of development, on which the console market took 25 years: <br><br>  - Video advertising is already one of the main marketing tools. <br>  - Trailers are becoming better. <br>  - The success of the project affects the use of popular IP in the game or advertising. <br><br>  It is very easy to determine the future trends of mobile advertising: you only have to look at a couple of hundred old console trailers. <br><br>  <i>Hello from the 90s!</i>  Want to make the game popular?  Do it under license.  The louder and more popular IP, the more users will install the game. <br>  <i>Hello from the 90s!</i>  A famous person can also become a brand.  Remember the games about Jackie Chan or Michael Jordan.  It works great in our time: proved by Kim Kardashian. <br>  <i>Hello from the 90s!</i>  Live Action Trailers are a rarity for console projects, where you can give players a demonstration of advanced graphics.  But the trick with the actors in the trailer works great for mobile gamers! <br>  <i>Hello from the 2000s!</i>  Cinematics are an impressive tool for enhancing brand image.  To create these trailers using advanced technology animation, Motion Capture and CG.  Plarium has a separate department that creates spectacular blue-eyed mobile games. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/GPubZy5wx5w%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700022,15700186,15700190,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhjQ8-WhxCRGiY34t090u_uAfeDsxA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  <i>Hello from the 2000s!</i>  As soon as developers had the opportunity, many console projects were ported to the PC.  Now the mobile market is also experiencing a boom in ports, and it will continue as long as users are ready to pay for old games in a new wrapper. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/_AWrlSciyFc%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700022,15700186,15700190,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhg6jD2nDDd4l5JH2FluVIamoq7F_w" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  Not so long ago, mobile games were associated with a pixel worm that eats the same black pixels.  Now it is the most promising and fast-growing market in the world.  At the moment, the cost of each user for companies is increasing, and in many ways the success of the project depends on how original and high-quality its advertising will be.  As in any other area, a good product is obtained when you take into account the mistakes of the past, follow the trends of the future and bring a little creativity to each project. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/T6EVstWcq-Q%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700022,15700186,15700190,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhi_GG3Qzl8m-R8Hhk0yKaOgAKqAHQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  What are your favorite trailers? </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/366687/">https://habr.com/ru/post/366687/</a></p>
