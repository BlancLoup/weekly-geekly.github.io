  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Java Day 2012. Impressions</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  I want to tell you a little about <a href="http://javaone.ru/javaday/">Java Day</a> , which happened on February 10th.  Immediately I will explain why I publish so late - the original idea was to compare Java Day with the Red Hat seminar (read <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/linux/138866/">my next post</a> ), but the events turned out to be so different that there was no point in writing about them mixed up.  In fact, the post will be not so much a description of what was happening there ( <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/java/137989/">this has already been published</a> ), but about the impressions that I have left. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/3c1/f31/c3f/3c1f31c3fbfb2c6655a9ecd81d956adb.jpg"><br>  I visited Sun Tech Days earlier, but then the event was held ‚Äúunder the wing‚Äù of Sun, so, frankly, I went to see how much Oracle had spoiled everything.  :-) Fortunately, I didn‚Äôt have to be very disappointed, although the influence of the new owner of Java was still very noticeable. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  An event at the Holiday Inn Hotel was held.  I do not know why, but for some reason large corporations consider that hotels and hotels are very successful for their conferences.  Personally, I don‚Äôt like these places much because of excessive bombast, but this is quite Oracle-like, so I'm not surprised.  A bit trite, yes, but everything went without organizational overlays.  In general, the event had less ‚Äúdrive‚Äù and increased corporate rigor (compared to what it was in the days of Sun Microsystems). <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/039/5db/dde/0395dbdde079d9e92aeb17ec8c99db2c.jpg"><br>  <i>I did not have to wander for a long time in search of the venue for Java Day 2012.</i> <br><br>  As I have already said, there were no ‚Äúshoals‚Äù in the organizational plan - there were signs hanging, there was enough space for everyone, there was no crush anywhere, they distributed the conference program (surprisingly, sometimes the organizers consider that visitors do not need it) and fed delicious sandwiches and coffee (this is also often forgotten, but to wait the whole day for the hungry is not very happy prospect).  The pen-paper, though distributed, was from the hotel, not from Oracle.  It seems a trifle, but already "not that." <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/8b9/fd5/35a/8b9fd535af60a34b57fb38fb59e82cd4.jpg"><br>  <i>Something like this ‚Äúplenary report‚Äù looked ‚Äúfrom the audience‚Äù.</i>

      I would like to note the presence of a large number of young, enthusiastic people and what is especially nice - a lot of pretty girls.  The prospects for Java with such popularity among young people are not very bad.  ;-) A large enough room was almost completely full.  I thought that a lot less people would want to come. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/781/2e8/69a/7812e869a6e1c812108790d3cdd1265e.jpg"><br>  <i>A decent sized room was almost full.</i> <br><br>  Judging by the presentations of Oracle, the main "trend" for the next few years, both in development and in use, can definitely be called cloud computing.  I think that this is the area where the most complete implementation can find the full potential of the platform.  By the way, more recently, Larry Ellison <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DyrEPTeTzg6M">laughed at those who talked about cloud computing</a> , and now this is the main direction of Java development.  That's how it happens.  :-) <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/e25/901/a8c/e25901a8cbd1ab79997c0bdde2d87c7c.jpg"><br>  <i>The future of Java is cloud computing.</i> <br><br>  Despite the fact that in the presentations the words community often flashed and the products of competitors were even mentioned, there were no competitors among Oracle speakers.  In other words, it was not Java Day, but <u>Oracle</u> Java Day.  And since I began to talk about shortcomings, I can not say that the reports, which were in the main part, were read in English for some reason.  I confess that I do not perceive the English speech ‚Äúby ear‚Äù very well, so it would be more convenient for me to listen to reports in my native language.  Not sure that I was alone there. <br><br>  But in general, I repeat, the event was a success.  All were satisfied.  Both presenters and listeners received positive emotions.  I think many people learned something useful for themselves from this event, which means that they had not been in vain to attend the conference.  Many thanks to the organizers. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/138333/">https://habr.com/ru/post/138333/</a></p>
