  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Forbes: What awaits cloud computing in 2013?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img align="right" src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/9e1/7a9/09d/9e17a909d3591c10ff4eca593d282c5e.jpg">  Every year at this time analysts, forecasters and experts, all, as at the same time, are trying to make a forecast about the prospects for the development of technology in the coming year.  And it's no secret that cloud computing has become the most discussed and hottest topic of this year.  The cloud has already loudly declared itself in the field of business technologies.  IT directors, vendors and analysts, as one, try to have time to determine what is behind all this and what will lead us. <br><br>  It is for this purpose that I selected some of the analysts' predictions for 2013 and selected among them those who, most likely, were destined to come true, if, of course, this did not happen. <br>  So, the following are the most likely forecasts: <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  1. More private clouds. </h4><br>  Such clouds have not yet finally moved to the site of the customer or consumer, in other words, they are not yet on-premises (on-premises clouds).  But they are also not public, publicly available.  Over the next year, there will be a tendency to the formation of an increasing number of private clouds, but controlled by someone else, the so-called ‚Äúoff-premise‚Äù clouds (off-clouds).  This was announced by Chris Morris from IDC.  In addition, the IDC said that such an approach would be cheaper.  ‚ÄúOnly well-protected isolated private clouds can meet all the necessary requirements.  The initial aspirations of companies to their own cloud infrastructure were seriously limited by the cost of time and money, and so far virtual private clouds provided a fairly effective solution for some organizations. ‚Äù <br><br><h4>  2. Cloud and mobile technologies merge. </h4><br>  This interesting assumption was made by John Staten of Forrester.  The existence of many cloud projects is due precisely to the need for mobile access to remote data and services.  ‚ÄúAlmost certainly, for each cloud infrastructure, there will be a mobile application connected to it that can flexibly respond to mobile client requests and handle large traffic.  By the way, almost every SaaS application today has a mobile client, which is also proof of the plausibility of this model. ‚Äù

    <h4>  3. New personal computers - their own clouds. </h4><br>  Gartner's specialists predict that personal clouds will gradually crowd out ordinary personal computers, taking on the role of storing content and personal information, providing access to services and becoming the center of our virtual life (by the way, after that they can still keep the name of the personal computer ).  ‚ÄúThe emergence and spread of such private user clouds will entail the creation of completely new services, directions and interactions that will become the new center of connections and activities.‚Äù  Among other things, Gartner is also optimistic that ‚Äúno form factor, no platform, technology or manufacturing company will dominate the market.  Personal clouds should shift the focus from client devices to cloud services, which, in turn, will already be delivered to various devices. ‚Äù <br><br><h4>  4. Increasing the number of cloud brokers. </h4><br>  Gartner predicts that more and more IT companies will assume the role of internal cloud service brokers, controlling the reservation and use of heterogeneous and always complex cloud services for their internal users and external business partners. <br><br><h4>  5. Growth in the number of specialized clouds and community clouds. </h4><br>  All you need to do is turn to ‚Äúcloud infrastructures designed specifically for highly specialized areas such as healthcare, financial markets, retail sales and industry,‚Äù said Dave Linthicum, technical director and co-founder of Blue Mountain Labs in the Cloud Computing Journal.  ‚ÄúThis kind of clouds will provide each of the areas with specialized protection, processes, and will also meet other specific requirements for each industry.‚Äù  Brian Patrick Donahue (Brian Patrick Donaghy), director of Appcore (also quoted in the Cloud Computing Journal), said that the specific requirements of each industry will increasingly be met by so-called ‚Äúcommunity clouds‚Äù.  A striking example is the growing requirements for standards for storing and protecting health-related data.  Another example is the clouds community in telecommunications, ensuring compliance with all disaster recovery standards. <br><br><h4>  6. There is a serious lack of personnel and experience. </h4><br>  IDC warns of the impending lack of qualifications and experience, which will arise as a distinctive feature of innovation, but at the same time, it will limit the introduction of technology in enterprises.  Complicating this problem is the fact that the attraction of cloud technologies comes from many different areas of business.  ‚ÄúThe inaccessibility of relevant personnel and experience is also aggravated by an increase in the need of various IT departments,‚Äù the consultants warn.  ‚ÄúThe IT team will very soon cease to be just a team of system administrators, network managers, developers and database administrators, and will also include delivery service managers, contract managers, relations managers (both with customers and with partners). ) and business analysts. ‚Äù <br><br><h4>  7. The disappearance of the "cloud" as a term. </h4><br>  James Staten of Forrester Research also predicts: ‚ÄúIn the end, we will stop calling everyone and everyone clouds and begin to more realistically assess what falls under this concept and what doesn‚Äôt‚Äù.  The director of Cloud &amp; IT Services at Equinix, Sam Johnston (Sam Johnston), agrees and adds: ‚Äúevery company with the word‚Äú cloud ‚Äùin the name will try to change the brand ... How many companies have the terms‚Äú Internet ‚Äùand‚Äú client / server ‚Äùin their names do you see today? ‚ÄùAnd as an added bonus, he stated in the Cloud Computing Journal:‚Äú in addition, the absurd-sounding names ending in ‚ÄúaaS‚Äù will suffer the same fate ‚Äù. <br><br>  How do you think these trends are realistic?  There is something to complement this seven? </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/162591/">https://habr.com/ru/post/162591/</a></p>
