  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How to read a lot of RSS feeds, spend a minimum of time and read only the important?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  <strong>Small introduction</strong> <br><br>  I work about 300 messages a day.  Sometimes their number reaches five hundred, records pass for a thousand.  How to read a lot, quickly and what is really interesting and necessary?  I share my technique of working with the reader.  There is nothing fundamentally ingenious in it, just different tools and techniques for the fastest efficient processing of information. <br><br>  I divided the article into two logical parts - the system of work with the aggregator and auxiliary tools that facilitate reading.  I'll start with the tools, and then move on to the system.  Surely there will be moments that you know, you just run through them, I hope that you will nevertheless find something new for yourself, and if you have something to share, you are welcome in the comments.

      Links to all programs or other articles will be under the article. <br><br>  And now - let's go! <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <strong>Most importantly - do not read everything!</strong> <br><br>  This is generally the most important thing.  Train yourself to quickly filter messages, and half the work is done.  Even more. <br><br>  No need to read everything!  Read only messages that interest you.  Even the most intelligent and good author can write nonsense.  Do not necessarily read it. <br><br>  It takes me 2 seconds to understand that the message is not interesting to me.  One of my favorite sources of information, lifehacker.com writes in square brackets in the header of the main message tag.  [Firefox] I always read.  [Mac] I leaf through right away - I don‚Äôt work under a poppy so I don‚Äôt have to. <br><br>  If the message has passed the first, a quick check, I either read it immediately or postpone it for later.  To do this in the google reader (I‚Äôll rely on the google reader here and not because I don‚Äôt know anything else - I worked with the bloglines and the bloglines for quite a long time, but today I think it‚Äôs the best Google reader to work with a lot of information general content - who disagree, please in the comments, I will gladly give myself to be persuaded or pereubezhu with no less pleasure you).  In the google reader, to postpone messages there is an asterisk called by the hot button S (tar).  As well as tags, hot button t (ag).  Tags - a thing very useful, especially when reading information, necessary for work.  The main thing is to try not to breed their great variety, because cleaning Google reader is still a pleasure.  And the Google reader is a bit complicated with the definition of ‚Äútag‚Äù - the tag can be a label, and maybe a folder. <br><br>  You need to set the label only once, then it will be ‚Äúprompted‚Äù <br><br><img src="http://blog.news-manager.ru/wp-content/uploads/2008/06/google-reader-podskaska-tega.png"><br><br>  So, we spend 2 seconds on understanding, we read this message or do not read, if the first is reading now or postponing until later. <br><br><h2>  Instruments </h2><br><br>  <strong>Use the hot buttons in the google reader.</strong> <br><br>  Hot buttons are needed by all.  Just try to use them.  And they, in general, is not very much and necessary. <br><br>  Here are the basic buttons: <br><br>  <b>J the</b> following message. <br><br>  <b>K</b> to return to the previous message <br><br>  These two buttons I use, probably, in 70% of cases.  On the J button on the keyboard, a speech bubble is located, so you don‚Äôt have to search for this button, it is tactile to find your fingers.  The k button is located to the right of the J button. Just hold 2 fingers on these buttons.  2 seconds to analyze the article.  Did not like?  Button J and analyze the following. <br><br>  <b>S</b> and <b>T</b> we have already passed - to put aside favorites / set a tag (tag), in order to return to these articles. <br><br>  <b>V</b> - open a message in a new window / tab (if the author is skatina, ie, writes messages with a cat)) You can, of course, google reader and click on the article title, then the page with this message will load in the article window, but with the V button will be more efficient, because - read the next 2 lines. <br><br>  [CTRL] + Page UP and <b>[CTRL] + Page DOWN</b> in firefox - go to the last open tab / return. <br><br>  I usually press V, the article starts loading in a new tab, press [CTRL] + Page DOWN immediately, which returns me to the google reader page, analyze the next message, and then press ctrl + page up when the tab has already loaded.  If you wait for the page to load in the reader itself, then ... let it be just 3 seconds.  But they bring down the rhythm of work, plus it‚Äôs still more convenient to read the page separately loaded than in the frame. <br><br>  Two less necessary buttons <br><br>  <b>F11</b> to go full screen.  The most full-screen mode used to give the Better Greader setting and the Fuller Screen firefox extension, which is not needed under the 3rd version of the browser, the firefox itself actually makes a real full screen.  If someone for some reason remained an old believer and instead of the third version is sitting under the second, let him put himself a fuller screen.  Yes, if you are not familiar with Better Greader, make sure you meet, no matter whether the second or third firefox is worth it.  And if you do not have a wide screen, and even the 17th, then make it necessary, there are modules that remove some panels in the google reader, the area for text will become larger. <br><br>  <b>U -</b> this button removes the left navigation panel, on widescreen monitors the thing is not necessary, but pleasant on the 17th monitor, if you leaned back in your chair and put your feet on the table.  Use the [CTRL] [+] buttons to increase the font (minus instead of plus decreases) and read it to your pleasure. <br>  The list of hot keys can be called with a question mark.  True, it stopped working long ago for me, but for <a href="http://geektimes.ru/users/whoami/" class="user_link">whoami</a> this button works. <br><br>  <strong>Change the type of output tapes</strong> <br><br>  Google reader displays messages either expanded (the program actually opens longer with a large number of tapes) or headers.  What is more convenient for you is up to you.  I guess it depends on the content.  If I read a tape of fresh bookmarks on a specific topic, I only print headlines, because there is not a lot of garbage in such a tape, but just crazy.  And if in the paragraph about ‚Äúit is not necessary to read everything‚Äù I talked about the expanded tape and filtering on the principle ‚Äúwhat I will not read‚Äù, then in the ribbon of bookmarks I usually proceed from another task - what can be read from this in general. <br>  Quick view change - keyboard buttons 1 and 2. <br><br>  <b>Postpone article for later</b> <br><br>  There is a situation that you liked the beginning of the article, you opened it in a new tab, and the article unexpectedly turned out to be too many letters.  The article should be put off somewhere. <br>  There are three fundamental methods <br><br>  The first is to go back to the google reader and start the star of the article / give a label.  Advantages of the solution - saving the system.  If you have created for yourself the rule ‚Äúeverything that needs to be re-read gets an asterisk‚Äù, then it is not necessary to develop it with ‚Äúand then read the bookmarks or something else‚Äù <br><br>  The second option is social bookmarks.  Bobrdobr, Memo, Vong and others.  Everything is clear, a couple of clicks, you can enter a login / password, enter labels, a description ... It eats time, but is available from any computer, as it is online. <br><br>  The third is an extension for firefox.  I would advise Read it later here, because it allows you to read the site offline (which, combined with Google gears, see below, is well combined, although still you will not open all the messages).  Or Tabu, which in one click will save the link with a small screenshot to the open page.  And it also opens it quickly.  The gain in speed, but works only from a specific computer and only online. <br><br><img src="http://blog.news-manager.ru/wp-content/uploads/2008/06/rasshirenie-taboo.png"><br><br>  Taboo in action <br><br><iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/mLNfsLpM8zo%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700023,15700186,15700190,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhiUiXMVgbJgTsODZAgJ5LxYffEc0w" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  Screencast about read it later (English, from the authors) <br><br>  There is, of course, the fourth option - to do what the guys with makeuseof.com advise - to mark as unread, but we will not do this, later I will explain why. <br><br>  <strong>Other things useful for Google Reader</strong> <br><br>  <b>Note in reader</b> .  From a relatively recent moment in Google Reader there was an opportunity to write comments to the linkblog (shared items, roughly speaking, instead of copying the articles you put them into the linkblog, and give it to PR or give it to your friends to read) Habre <br><br>  Those who linkblog in google raeder does not lead, doubly lucky - I use this tape as a folder for messages with my comments)).  This is a useful lotion in case the article is long and one or two paragraphs are needed in it.  To immediately mark what is important in this article and what is the paragraph (middle, end of text). <br><br>  But the most important thing is to install the Note in reader in firefox.  The beauty of it is what it is - you somehow got to the site with curious text.  Mark with the right button and enter the google reader into the ribbon with your comment. <br><br><img src="http://blog.news-manager.ru/wp-content/uploads/2008/06/google-reader-note-in-reader.png"><br><br>  That is, it turns out an alternative to social bookmarking.  Yes, less functional, but faster.  That is, you need to understand for yourself what material goes to social bookmarks (I recommend manuals or long articles, like this one))), and what goes to Note in reader is some text that you soon decide to finalize / finish reading / to comprehend, in short, what is important, but in general is one-time. <br><br>  <b>Google gears</b> .  Installs quickly.  It downloads a bunch of messages that can be read offline.  True without pictures.  Sorry.  But nothing can be done, so far the only way.  Anything is better than nothing.  I use often on the road. <br><br>  With the third version of firefox, google gears are no longer needed.  In any case, they say so.  But for some reason, after I deleted google gears, this option has stopped working. <br>  Maybe it was meant that for firefox 3.0 it does not need to be installed, is it in the standard package?  Those.  remove it then you no one forbids. <br>  Not the point. <br><br><h2>  System </h2><br><br>  This is the second part of the article.  If we talked about physical add-ins before, now we are talking only about logical tools of work. <br><br>  The system is very important, please do not underestimate it. <br><br>  <strong>Put tapes in folders!</strong> <br><br>  My folders are called ‚Äúwork‚Äù, ‚Äúquarantine‚Äù, ‚Äúdiscussion‚Äù, ‚Äúrelax‚Äù, ‚Äúfriends‚Äù. <br><br>  The first folder contains useful work tapes, the second one contains everything that has been recently signed (they either go from here to another folder or are erased forever).  In the discussions there are RSS on the comments in blogs, the authors of which understand that it is necessary to give the reader the opportunity to subscribe not only to the news feed via rss, but also the commentary to the article. <br><br>  Relax - articles of fundamentally different content (literature, stories, some photographers, in a word, everything that cannot be processed quickly, but takes time, mood and pleasure). <br><br>  Friends are friends of friends or subject blogs of friends that do not overlap with my work.  Roughly speaking, the first three folders are working, the next two are personal. <br><br>  Smash all your tapes into folders! <br><br>  I have only bash.org outside my folders, my own blog feed, news from WordPress, which the blog runs on and from windows live writer, which I write to the blog. <br><br>  <strong>Read folders, not tapes.</strong> <br><br>  Then you will always read the freshest, this is the most correct and detailed version of the information input.  If you stick to the system of folders, then you do not need to select the tape from the folder - all tapes in this folder are equally important for you.  Those that are less important are in the wrong folder!  And if you call in your own words - you have to erase them.  Less important flax does not happen.  There are important and unimportant.  The latter is equated to unnecessary. <br><br>  I had two folders for work - work 1 and work 2. From a certain point, I realized that in the folder "work 1" there were all the tapes that I needed.  An analysis of "work 2" showed that "work 2" goes into the trash.  For analysis, I had to read each tape separately, since the question was - do I need it at all or not?  I transferred one or two tapes to work 1, the rest was erased.  And the number of unread messages does not pressure me. <br><br>  Stupid situation turned out with mek juz of.  I subscribed to them immediately, bypassing the "quarantine".  Somewhere I found a very good article from make-up and signed. <br><br>  Do not do this!  This is a mistake that cost me a lot of time.  After that I received a lot of messages from the make-up office, they all, EVERYTHING TO ONE turned out to be uninteresting to me.  I just did not look at them as intently as I look at the quarantine tapes.  Therefore, I spent a lot of time to understand that the author writes a lot, but very superficially.  It seems to me that each described program he devotes no more than 15 minutes to become familiar with.  A typical example of this is tips for google reader users - mark your favorite messages as unread, otherwise you will not see them again.  If the author worked with the program a little longer, he would understand that it is much more convenient to search for messages by tags or asterisks.  For me, however, it‚Äôs a mystery why he has so little experience with a google reader, bloggers with so much input, even if achieved by quantity, not quality, the input volume does not decrease from this - google reader is very good, it‚Äôs not a reader for them as a tool.  Gina Trapani, Robert Scoble to confirm this. <br><br>  <strong>Mark all as read</strong> <br><br>  There is such a button.  Do not be afraid to press it when a lot of reading has accumulated.  When it is a lot of it, it presses psychologically.  It will be more useful if you read the most recent and reset.  Somehow, by the end of the article I returned to the topic ‚Äúdo not read everything‚Äù)) <br><br>  <strong>Delete what you are not interested.</strong> <br><br>  It's all so clear.  Just do not be afraid to unsubscribe from the tape, it will not be offended at you. <br><br>  That's all. <br>  Waiting for your advice and observations on the effective work with rss-tapes <br><br>  Links <br><br>  <a href="http://blog.news-manager.ru/2008/02/25/3-poleznyx-dopolneniya-v-firefox/">Better Greader for Google reader, Fuller Screen for fx &lt;3.0</a> <br><br>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blog/google/41486.html">Discussion Note in reader on Habr√©</a> <br><br>  <a href="http://www.ideashower.com/ideas/launched/read-it-later/">read it later</a> <br><br>  <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/5756">Taboo</a> <br><br>  if anyone is interested - <a href="http://blog.news-manager.ru/">my blog about RSS for the user</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/28474/">https://habr.com/ru/post/28474/</a></p>
