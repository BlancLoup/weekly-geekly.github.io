More precisely, I have, but as a regular customer.  I have an online store and I personally, once or twice a week, <strike>turn my department into a branch of hell on earth</strike> and privately unload it into its womb in a couple dozen parcels over the past 4 years.  Epicly laying a mail window with my boxes as brickwork :) And therefore, I have a number of observations and some statistics for the last four years. <br><br>  Of course, I understand that 99% of the perturbations are accounted for by Internet shoppers waiting for a package from any Chinese ebaev, and there really are problems.  But my goal is not to give the unfortunate mail another kick, but still say something positive.  Give a couple of tips on proper mail handling and light the dim LED at the end of the tunnel.  Therefore, I will only talk about the circulation of shipments within the country and from Russia to the wild lands :) And it will be, for the most part, about the so-called ‚ÄúFirst Class‚Äù.  Since  I use mostly them. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  So: <br><br>  <b>Reliability</b> <br>  Starting my own business, I was afraid that there would be hell and a nightmare and departures would go nowhere and would have to compensate customers for losses and incur wild expenses due to repeated shipments, and my packages cost several thousand.  In reality, everything turned out to be much more responsible.  During these 4 years we have sent several thousand parcels of which 10% are overseas.

      So, for all the time: <br><br><ul><li>  Irretrievably lost - 2 (TWO pieces).  And one was stolen and an empty box arrived with a huge hole in its side and the remnants of the package inside, without attachment.  Why did some gopnik need a demo payment, and what he was going to do with it, I would really like to know.  Really decided to change the qualification?  ;) </li><li>  Returned back without waiting for delivery - 3. Apparently the recipient was waiting for the notice, but he was not brought. </li><li>  Parcels that were considered lost (i.e., which went more than two months and demanded re-shipment of goods), but then come down - 2 </li><li>  They were fatally damaged, which required a warranty replacement - 1 </li><li>  Minor reversible damage, which required strengthening of the package that solved this problem - 10 ... 15. </li><li>  International parcels (Russia -&gt; ***) lost - 0 </li><li>  International parcels considered lost, but then come down - 1 </li></ul><br><br>  Those.  for 4 years the number of problems brought me hemorrhoids and financial problems can be counted on the fingers. <br><br>  <b>Logistics and deadlines</b> <br>  Surprisingly, with the delivery time inside the country, Post of Russia is doing well.  At least from the department to the office mail goes an average of 5-12 days.  These are measurements on tracks and customer messages from Kaliningrad to Vladivostok, one million cities and small villages that cannot be found on the regional map. <br>  There were practically no problems with foreign clients either.  Once, the drug control of Moldavia got to the fascinated accompanying documentation for my demo payment (who got it in the course :))) I won‚Äôt tell the rest, I won‚Äôt break off, but the package came to Israel as if they were playing football.  Even in Syria, I drove in normally (even before Asad began to drench).  In general, it is possible to send abroad from Russia relatively without tension. <br><br>  <b>Branches of hell</b> <br>  Where is hell?  And hell in the offices.  Mail can bullet fly all sorting and intermediate points and for long weeks stuck in the office.  Especially if it is a large branch of a relatively large city.  <a href="http://tank--girl.livejournal.com/930653.html">There are not enough people, parcel processing requires a huge number of operations, technology of the last century and no automation</a> .  Therefore, if you live in a large city and wait for a parcel, then your hope to wait for a notification or tracking change tends to zero.  But you can come to the office in person and request the package and with a probability of 70% will find it.  Tested on multiple clients. <br>  They write to me in a panic that there is no notice, the tracking was lost immediately after Chelyabinsk.  I calm and recommend to go to the post office and ask - it helps almost always. <br><br>  Well, if you live in a small town, then problems with your department probably will not exist at all.  For example, last year, I traveled around 30 offices in Kurgan, bought mail boxes (they are twice cheaper there than in Chelyabinsk) - there was no queue IN ONE department.  There was also a funny joke - in one ordinary hruschebe, there were two different post offices from different ends. <br><br>  <b>Useful tips</b> <br>  When receiving a parcel from Russia, do not wait for a notification or tracking update, and after 10-12 days of waiting, stomp into the department and ask for your parcel.  Most likely she will already be in the department. <br><br>  VERY IMPORTANT MOMENT!  You need to ask a specific type of departure.  Those.  if you received a parcel and you ask for a package, then you will be told with a poker interface that you don‚Äôt have the package.  Apparently they have some kind of professional deformation, otherwise it will not be explained.  Yes, and papers on different types of shipments are in different places with them.  So be sure to find out from the sender exactly what kind of shipment sent your investment and ask for it.  Often type is written in tracking.  Be sure to also specify the class of departure.  If it's first class, then ask otherwise it may not be found.  Because of the hill, if the departure is less than 2 kg, then this is most likely a small package.  They have no special incentive to carefully dig the whole branch.  So direct them immediately to the correct shelf. <br><br>  If the parcel did not arrive, then do not brake and immediately roll the search requests on both sides.  Accelerates a lost parcel, checked.  After some time, the answer will come, saying that your post was handed to the recipient, what are you doing here? <br><br>  Sending small pieces weighing up to 2kg is better with a first class parcel.  The difference in price between sending it is minimal, you can send commodity investments (with a simple parcel post once) and it goes quite vigorously.  And most importantly, you only need to fill in the inscription on the box and everything that greatly speeds up the sending process. <br>  Fill out all forms and notices in advance.  The brakes are terribly furious, beginning to frantically fill out forms already stuck in the window, so tupitive in their smartphones in the queue. <br><br>  Any box can serve as a package, as long as it is without any marking whatsoever and in proportions and dimensions resembled standard postal boxes.  Well, it was strong as a safe.  They will be unlocked, you can poke them into the rules of registration of mailings.  There is no word that the box should be exclusively branded.  If you send a lot, then buy a box from a third-party supplier, a lot of them.  Cost 3-4 times cheaper. <br><br>  Address labels glue on the boxes tightly, the entire area.  Perfectly established himself as the PVA or Moment.  But self-adhesive often lags behind the cardboard during its deformation. <br><br>  Sending a parcel abroad pretend the path.  If you can get there by land, then there is practically no difference in terms between air or ground delivery, but air will be more expensive than one and a half times.  But if the parcel goes somewhere to the USA or Australia, where you can not get there by train, then send it only by air mail, since  otherwise, you will run into a sea container ship, which your package will be crippling for about two months. <br><br>  <b>Retribution</b> <br>  Do not hesitate to roll complaints.  To client@russianpost.ru They are responded to very quickly.  For example, after the first application in the room of department 454080, air conditioners were connected, which were installed but not powered and hung just half a year.  And after a couple more, the application earned an electronic queue and returned the chairs to the waiting room.  Then, of course, the funny replies from the mail administration came again, but the result was achieved.  (The same applies, by the way, to any state-owned office. Of course, you will receive a rotten formal reply, but at the same time the office itself will begin to rigidly tantrum from above. My mother once so angrily punished the local polyclinic that now when the chief physician sees her, the nervous tic begins . And then it was in the Internet reception to Madame Arbidol to roll the statement.) <br><br>  <b>ZY</b> <br>  Mail can be greatly saved by thorough processing of the mail processing process in the department.  It's not even about the introduction of any technology.  And in the standardization of the process, reducing unnecessary operations and procedures and working out the ergonomics of all this.  I once calculated that to send a regular parcel to the operator, you need to perform 15 operations, of which half can be safely thrown out.  At the same time, she is still torn with a package from the table to the table.  At the same time, for sending first-class parcels of the same size and weight, the operator makes 5 operations less, which can also be greatly reduced.  The same applies to accepting payments, issuing parcels / pensions and heaps of everything else that happens in the mail. <br><br>  <b>ZZZY</b> <br>  If anyone has an online store, then share in the comments about your observations about the circulation of mail within the country. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/174889/">https://habr.com/ru/post/174889/</a></p>
