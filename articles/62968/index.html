      But it is not quite about this, these are flowers, and the berries here were: <br>  once again sitting in the dining room at work with colleagues, the conversation about DOM-2 started, as the majority of the females sharing the living space of my colleagues watch this <s>highly intelligent</s> show :) <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Despite the fact that everyone thought it was a full <a href="http://lurkmore.ru/%25D0%25A3%25D0%25BD%25D1%258B%25D0%25BB%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B5_%25D0%25B3%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BE">UG</a> , opinions differed on how it is done, how it is being conducted.  And what is this process in general? <br><br><br>  Several people, instead of with me, being full nihilists, gave birth to the following: <br><br>  <i><b>1.</b> actors play</i> <i><br></i>  <i><b>2.</b> do not live together, but gather only for the time of filming or may live for ‚Äúlive‚Äù cameras for some time</i> <i><br></i>  <i><b>3.</b> On the basis of tracking the rating of the program, a so-called ‚Äúmilestone‚Äù scenario is built - i.e.</i>  <i>when the scenario is not clear - ‚Äúgo there - do something‚Äù, and the main ‚Äúmilestones‚Äù are marked - the points of the ‚Äúplot‚Äù, and between them impromptu.</i> <i><br></i> <br>  Those.  reality show as a matter of fact - an ordinary theatrical production - the truth is not a drop there. <br><br><br>  Others argued that, no, they say they really live, perhaps some kind of a certain ‚Äúgeneral line‚Äù is present there - but they really live and really survive. <br><br>  This option may well be. <br>  It has been proved for quite a long time (for example, from the very same prohibited - secret experience with a pressure chamber in the USSR) - that if you put any (even friendly people) people in a fairly closed volume and stressful situation (this is used as a catalyst), then very soon there will be a clear hierarchical community. <br>  There is a leader and followers, they are plagued by the same feuds as their older brother - humanity as a whole.  Those.  a kind of micromodel is formed.  With certain "priming" that m, you can generate anything - from happiness to murder - in general, you can create absolutely any strife. <br><br>  For example, by introducing a specially trained person (or acting from the outside) you can simulate almost any life situation and manage them - that is,  to create the real life simulator the most that is true. One thing is true: in contrast to the acclaimed The Sims, pawns will be real people. <br><br><br>  Well, now the most important thing is that we could not come to a common opinion - the arguments were on the one hand, and on the other.  And perhaps there is generally a third option? <br>  The management of society, although difficult, is quite possible, and if a group of professionals manages, then the complexity is altogether leveled. <br><br>  Actually summing up all of the above - maybe someone from the respected me habrasoobschestva knows how to create such a reality show.  How are they being managed?  Is this really some kind of ‚Äúpseudo-truth‚Äù, or is it a complete fake - in my opinion?  I would just be interested.  At least based on the fact that for certain the same model, which is simply much more complicated, is used by those who control the biggest life simulator - the state :) <br><br>  <b>PS</b> I don‚Äôt want to offend those who look at this work ‚Äî there are many people on earth and markers do not always taste the same :) Everything that is written here is purely my opinion and that of my colleagues. <br><br>  <b>PPS</b> Treat everything with humor - it helps to avoid stress, when receiving information that there is no Santa Claus :-D <br><br>  <b>PPPS</b> And yes - i hate <b>DOM-2</b> :-D <br><br>  <i>Most of all I like that the number of minuses of the topic is much more than the number of comments :) You should at least write your opinion :)</i> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/62968/">https://habr.com/ru/post/62968/</a></p>
