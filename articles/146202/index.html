It will be held on October 17 in Moscow, in the info-exhibition center "InfoSpace". <br><br>  The program of the Forum is being actively formed, there will be Western stars, interesting reports from our specialists, we will try to avoid repetitions, but at the same time highlight the main market trends. <br><br>  Actually about them, about trends, and will be discussed below.  I would like to ponder with you what you should pay more attention to.  I would be happy to suggestions in the comments.  All those who consider such sentences sensible - plus the best in the comments.  I marked the main ideas and ideas with tags in square brackets, use them in the answers, please.

    <a name="habracut"></a>  Obviously, ‚Äúweb technologies‚Äù is too general, a broad concept for a one-day conference.  With all the desire we will not fit in it all that would cover this topic completely.  Nevertheless, we will try to put the best and most interesting questions in a convenient format.  We will have several streams in different halls, we will try to minimize the movement between rooms for those who came to listen to reports on any one topic interesting to him. <br><br>  <b><sup>[NOSQL]</sup></b> By server-side, we will definitely have a NoSQL theme <a href="">.</a>  Our solution, <a href="http://tarantool.org/">Tarantool</a> , is quite popular, and the reports of the guys from the development group, as a rule, collect full halls.  What other NoSQL solutions would be interesting?  <a href="http://memcached.org/">Memcached</a> , <a href="http://redis.io/">Redis</a> , <a href="http://couchdb.apache.org/">CouchDB</a> , <a href="http://www.mongodb.org/">MongoDB</a> ?  <a href="http://cassandra.apache.org/">Cassandra</a> , <a href="http://hbase.apache.org/">HBase</a> , <a href="http://code.google.com/p/scalaris/">Scalaris</a> , <a href="http://project-voldemort.com/">Voldemort</a> ?  Maybe <a href="http://neo4j.org/">Neo4j</a> ?  What kind of experts on these technologies would you like to see on the Forum?  Perhaps the western "stars"? <br><br>  <b><sup>[SSJS]</sup></b> Also on the surface is a theme with server-side JavaScript.  Despite the fact that the first developer tools appeared almost 18 years ago, the technology uniformity approach on both sides of the Internet began to be widely used in Russian projects only in recent years.  We have already talked about our experience with the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/v8/">V8</a> .  What else?  <a href="http://nodejs.org/">Node.js</a> , <a href="http://ringojs.org/">RingoJS</a> ? <br><br>  <b><sup>[CLOUD]</sup></b> About cloud technology now does not speak just lazy <a href="">.</a>  This topic wholly pulls into a weekly conference, and the most delicious is needed for developers to choose.  Last year we talked about Hadoop, there was an introductory lecture from Kai Vogt from <a href="http://www.cloudera.com/">Cloudera</a> , and Kai invited some of the Forum participants to his master class.  The story about Hadoop will be necessary, and what else?  Maybe a <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/">newest Amazon EC2</a> master class <a href="">?</a> <br><br>  <b><sup>[FS]</sup></b> At one time, many copies were broken around clustered file systems: almost every implementation had ‚Äúpitfalls‚Äù and compatibility problems.  <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_File_System">GFS</a> , <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/OCFS">OCFS</a> , <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Parallel_File_System">GPFS</a> .  Particularly acute is the issue of the performance of cluster file systems under heavy load. <br><br>  <b><sup>[JS]</sup></b> There will be topics about JavaScript <a href="">,</a> here the choice is very wide.  At conferences, almost all topics can be divided into two categories: approaches to effective development, libraries and frameworks.  Or is there something important?  What would you like to hear? <br><br>  <b><sup>[FLANG]</sup></b> New languages, trends and programming techniques in the application to the web.  Here there is an idea to convey the message that sometimes it is more correct to plant a thoughtful technology zoo and nuclear projects inside the project, and not to be limited to only one thing.  For example, there is a whole class of functional programming languages ‚Äã‚Äãin which it is easier to solve certain tasks (and the code goes out more supported).  The issue is also quite controversial when applied to the web, to the dynamics of changes and to the profile of the personnel market.  Here you are looking for months on a Python programmer, and what problems will be with <a href="http://www.scala-lang.org/">Scala</a> , <a href="http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Haskell">Haskell</a> , <a href="http://clojure.org/">Clojure / Lisp</a> or <a href="http://www.chicagoboss.org/">Chicago Boss / Erlang</a> !  However, is all this interesting? <br><br>  <b><sup>[ITMANAGEMENT]</sup></b> There is a general theme for managing development.  This is all connected with the approaches, methods, recommendations on the organization of development.  This includes topics from Agile, ITSM, from the more ‚Äúhardcore‚Äù ones - tools and mechanisms for organizing technical development support, ‚Äúhoning‚Äù task trackers for their processes, integrating systems among themselves, sharing experience and sharing the groundwork.  What do you want to listen to the most? <br><br>  <b><sup>[MOBILE]</sup></b> It's already obvious to everyone that the web is leaping into the mobile by leaps and bounds.  The share of users with iOS and Android is already such that no major service can afford to ignore it.  A dozen interesting frameworks have entered the market to create specialized versions of sites or standalone applications tightly integrated with the web service.  What of this direction would you be interested in? <br><br>  <b><sup>[API]</sup></b> After Facebook opened the <a href="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/reference/fql/">FQL</a> and <a href="https://developers.facebook.com/">Facebook API</a> , expectations from external interfaces have reached a new level.  For many developers, even opportunities exported by Google or <a href="http://corp.mail.ru/">Mail.Ru Group</a> projects are discoveries.  But similar examples in the Russian web services market almost did not appear.  Here you can get acquainted with the capabilities of existing APIs, share your experience in how to ensure the convenience, reliability, security or scalability of such interfaces.  What would you like to hear? <br><br>  <b><sup>[SPEAKERS]</sup></b> According to Western speakers.  There is one big philosophical question: which of the Western ‚Äústars‚Äù could light up better than our specialists (by our means I don‚Äôt just mean by e-mail users)?  It is obvious that representatives of brands - technical directors, leading experts of well-known and popular services - could tell about the experience in their projects.  There are speakers telling about some product or service ‚Äúfrom the first person‚Äù, here you can ask questions that no third-party consultant will answer you.  There are still some narrow ‚Äúfundamental‚Äù areas in which there are simply not enough own stars in Russia - I don‚Äôt want to give examples, because this is the most holivar topic. <br><br>  <b><sup>[CONFS]</sup></b> Yes, and more.  If among you there is someone who recently attended Western conferences of a similar format, we would be happy to hear recommendations and suggestions, ideas, thoughts, everything new and unusual that you would like to see at our event.  For an open discussion - send comments, personal messages directly. <br><br>  Registration for the Technology Forum will open in August.  <b>Wait for your offers!</b> <br><br>  <i>Aliyev Rauf,</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Director of Research and Education</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Mail.Ru Group</i> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/146202/">https://habr.com/ru/post/146202/</a></p>
