      Chinese state-owned media have announced plans for the Chinese government <a href="https://habr.com/ru/news/t/449822/">to create a lunar base in 10 years</a> .  This is a manned station, not an automatic test station. <br><br>  In addition, Beijing is going to launch an automatic mission to Mars by 2020, and the returned lunar station Chang'e-5 will be sent to its target later this year. <br><br>  The space station "Heavenly Palace" according to the plan should go into Earth orbit by 2022, as reported by representatives of the Chinese space agency.  The Palace will be an alternative to the ISS, which was the result of the joint work of the United States, Russia, Canada, Europe and Japan.  It should be decommissioned by 2024. <br><br><h3>  Tele2 offers subscribers transition to eSIM </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/33c/26b/77f/33c26b77f0fa6513b667b76e5dfafcae.jpg"><br><br>  The Russian telecommunications operator Tele2 <a href="https://habr.com/ru/news/t/449924/">has already begun to offer subscribers to switch to virtual SIM cards eSIM while maintaining the number</a> , as reported by Vedomosti.  Thus, Tele2 was the first Russian telecommunication company to implement support for new type SIM cards. <br><br>  In hardware, such functions support the latest models of iPhones, Google Pixel, tablets, Samsung and Apple smart watches.  Currently, about 30 operators from 24 countries are working with this technology.  Last year it was integrated by such companies as T-Mobile in Germany, the Czech Republic and Austria, the British EE, Vodafone in Germany.  In the US, eSim is supported by T-Mobile, Verizon and AT &amp; T. <br><br>  In order for the device with eSim to connect to the cellular network, you do not need to insert a regular SIM card.  The user only needs to scan the QR code provided by the operator or download the application, after which the new number will be recorded on the built-in virtual SIM card. <br><br><h3>  Russian retailers offered to enter 15% for all overseas online purchases </h3><br>  The Association of E-commerce Companies (ACIT) has <a href="https://habr.com/ru/news/t/450082/">made another offer</a> - to enter 15% for all purchases from abroad.  In addition, representatives of the association propose to exclude goods from foreign online stores from the category of goods for personal use, plus recognize cross-border trade as a form of foreign economic activity. <br><br>  Proposals were sent to the Ministry of Communications and Mass Media at the end of April.  The Office, in turn, redirected them to the Analytical Center for Government, Institute.  Ye.T. Gaidar and the head of the Post of Russia Nikolai Podguzov. <br><br>  The proposal, according to its authors, should "protect the domestic producer."  The latter loses competition to foreign online stores, including Chinese companies.  The letter says about ‚Äúequalizing conditions‚Äù in which foreign and domestic e-commerce companies operate. <br><br><h3>  P2P vulnerability affected half a million IoT devices </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c7d/e2a/ff8/c7de2aff83c9fd9015dbe78805f64b70.jpg"><br><br>  The other day it became known that hundreds of video cameras, baby monitors and ‚Äúsmart‚Äù door bells <a href="https://habr.com/ru/news/t/450174/">were at risk of being compromised</a> .  The fact is that P2P connections are vulnerable - they provide an opportunity to intercept traffic, receive personal data of users and manage devices. <br><br>  So, using P2P-technology, you can quickly connect without configuring routing rules and port forwarding.  To connect you just need to read through a special application QR-code.  A vulnerability is found in the iLnkP2P component that establishes the P2P connection. <br><br>  It is used in software systems of a large number of Chinese brands, including HiChip, TENVIS, SV3C, VStarcam, Wanscam, NEO Coolcam, Sricam, Eye Sight, HVCAM.  You can determine the vulnerable device by UID: it is a number in the format FFFF-123456-ABCDE. <br><br><h3>  Facebook update </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a90/669/88b/a9066988b72aa98751d32dc87afc4a84.jpg"><br><br>  A few days ago <a href="https://habr.com/ru/news/t/450250/">, the F8 conference took place</a> .  On it, the head of the social network and its top managers told about the updates that will be rolled out during 2019.  The list of updates will affect all services and products to which the company relates, including Messenger, WhatsApp, Instagram, Facebook and Oculus virtual reality helmets. <br><br>  In particular, Messendger will be updated - it will be rewritten from scratch, plus a desktop application will appear under Windows and Mac.  The program is integrated with Storiz, so now it will be much easier to share short videos with friends in a chat. <br><br>  In Instagram, the counters of likes will disappear - in any case, for some users.  This will be done in order to understand whether people will feel better if they stop chasing the approval of their subscribers. <br><br>  The social network itself will receive a new design, called FB5.  The main direction of the work of the authors of the new design is to simplify and speed up the work of the resource. <br><br><h3>  Identification in messengers by phone number </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/33c/9a0/a61/33c9a0a6120c8679a97afb41ac3071b2.jpg"><br><br>  On May 5 of this year, the <a href="https://habr.com/ru/news/t/450276/">government decree</a> ‚ÄúOn Approval of the Rules for Identification of Users of the Internet Information and Telecommunications Network‚Äù by the organizer of the instant messaging service <a href="https://habr.com/ru/news/t/450276/">comes into force</a> . <br><br>  Users from Russia can only register by phone number, and nothing else.  Unidentified users will not be able to exchange emails. <br><br>  In addition, messenger operators are obliged to limit the distribution of prohibited information by law and to ensure the distribution of messages at the request of the authorities.  In turn, mobile operators should store the unique identifiers of the users of instant messengers. <br><br><h3>  The President of Russia signed the law on the "sovereign Internet" </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/abe/094/02f/abe09402f198b15cdba4ccae34bdc4d6.jpg"><br><br>  Two days ago, the President of the Russian Federation signed the law on the "sovereign Internet", the corresponding document appeared on the official Internet portal of legal information.  This law is positioned as a tool that is able to ensure the stable operation of the Russian-language segment of the global network in the event of aggressive actions from abroad. <br><br>  The developers of the draft law state that in order to implement the provisions of the document, it is necessary to install on the communication networks specialized technical means capable of determining the source of the transmitted data.  Relevant devices should be able to restrict access to resources and services with prohibited information - not only by network addresses, but also by prohibiting the passage of passing traffic. <br><br>  But the Federation Council believes that the law protects the Russian-speaking segment of the network: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not this law that should be feared, but the possibility of disconnecting Russia from digital technologies, digital portals, from the Internet should be feared.  If you carefully read this law, you will agree: Russia in no way wants to isolate itself from the world, to isolate itself from the world.  It is meaningless and impossible. ‚Äù </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/450456/">https://habr.com/ru/post/450456/</a></p>
