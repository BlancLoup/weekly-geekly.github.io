  <section class="page js-page"><h1>SMS scammers get to discount coupons</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Discount coupons are becoming more and more popular, more and more people are starting to use them and as a result, an increasing number of entrepreneurs want to make money on it. <br>  Someone is trying to work honestly, rushes into this difficult race by opening another discount site and starting to attract traffic using well-known methods. <br><br>  And some are trying to openly deceive gullible users. <br>  Surely, many people remember: SMS direction finders, Vkontakte / ICQ interceptors, mobile spies, etc. <br><a name="habracut"></a>  Such sites offered to download programs that supposedly allow reading other people's SMS-messages, correspondence in ICQ or Vkontakte, but in reality this turned out to be nothing more than an entertaining game.  To receive the program, it was proposed to send a specific SMS message to a short text number.  The cost of 1 SMS was from 50p.  up to 300r., somewhere you had to send as many as 3 SMS to get the coveted spyware software. <br>  As a result, hundreds of thousands of gullible people, if not millions, were deprived of considerable sums. <br><br>  And it seems that after a wave of indignation of deceived users, this ‚Äúshop‚Äù was covered up. <br>  There was even a post on Habr√© - <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/subconsciousness/76233/">‚ÄúThe End to GSM Direction Finders, SMS Interceptors and other scammers</a> . <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/subconsciousness/76233/">‚Äù</a>  But, probably, this is far from the end!

      It seems that <b>SMS fraudsters have paid attention to such a tidbit of the market as ‚Äúdiscount coupons‚Äù</b> ! <br><br>  As one of the options for finding information on new coupon-shops for <a href="http://alcoupone.ru/">AlKupone,</a> we use Direct and Adsense.  We make in Yandex the request ‚Äúdiscount coupons‚Äù and see who crawls out in the Yandex.Direct block.  A few days ago, we found there an advertisement for one of the new discount sites and switched to it.  A seemingly ordinary website with discount coupons (city selection, registration / authorization, coupon examples) has opened. <br><br><img src="http://img405.imageshack.us/img405/7443/habr1.png" alt="image"><br><br>  The only address he had for the ‚Äúwhite‚Äù project was not at all memorable, and not related to the topic of discounts, but rather to SMS tests: <s><a href="http://freedom-test.com/kupon">freedom-test.com/kupon</a></s> <br><br>  The announcement that you can buy an iPhone 3G for only 2000r was sharply caught. <br>  <b>And from that moment on, the user was almost hooked.</b>  He wonders what kind of action this is.  Although, even theoretically, such a discount on the iPhone will not give any store! <br><br>  As soon as you click on this promotion, a standard registration form appears, in which it is proposed to enter an email, come up with a password and enter your real phone number. <br><br><img src="http://img3.imageshack.us/img3/3018/habr2.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Even such large discount sites as Grupon do not ask the user for his mobile phone number at the registration stage. <br>  And the wording: <i>‚ÄúEnter your phone number, it will receive SMS with an activation code.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>By this you confirm that you are NOT an information collector for spam ‚Äù</i> - in itself is a blatant nonsense! <br>  Who will have the idea to collect spam on your mobile number? <br>  Anyway‚Ä¶ <br><br>  After you enter your real phone number, you will receive a free activation code, which you will need to enter in a special form on the same site.  After specifying the code, the service is activated, and you get access to this site on an ongoing basis. <br><br>  <b>But from this moment the user is already caught on the bait.</b> <br>  Under the guise of registering on this discount site, you have issued an SMS subscription. <br>  <b>Now, from your mobile account 1 time in 3 days there will be a debit in the amount of 300 rubles.</b>  And the site itself will be just a dummy. <br><br>  But it was not written anywhere, that this is a SMS subscription! <br>  On the main page, in the footer with a scroll, a font almost merging with the background color, such information is still given: <i>‚ÄúSubscription and trial period are not available for MTS, Megafon, Tele2 and other operators.</i>  <i>To gain access to the site, subscribers need to send a response SMS message to the number 3858. The cost for MTS subscribers is 304.79 rubles, for Tele2 subscribers - 250 rubles, for MegaFon subscribers - 300 rubles, for Beeline subscribers - 300 rubles, other operators - about 300 rubles.</i>  <i>Cost is specified with the VAT.</i>  <i>To receive the service you need to send 3 sms.</i>  <i>The cost of access to content provider services is set by your operator.</i>  <i>Detailed information can be found: - in the section ‚ÄúServices by short numbers‚Äù on the website mts.ru or by contacting the contact center by phone 8 800 333 0890 (0890 for MTS subscribers).</i>  <i>For Subscribers of all national GSM Operators of Ukraine, the cost of sending SMS to the numbers 3354, 4161, 3353 is 48, 32, 24 hryvnias, respectively. ‚Äù</i> <br><br><img src="http://img534.imageshack.us/img534/2302/habr3.png" alt="image"><br><br>  What should the user do if he fell for SMS-scammers? <br>  Attempt to unsubscribe from the subscription as soon as possible, until the billing has begun, as they will only begin to withdraw money from the mobile account on the second day after the subscription. <br>  The first day, as if trial.  It is necessary under some sauce to submit a subscription service. <br><br>  <b>To unsubscribe, you need to find the section ‚ÄúManage your subscription‚Äù on this discount site and enter your phone number in a special form.</b> <br>  This section is on every such site, as it is a strict requirement of billing and mobile operators. <br><br><img src="http://img810.imageshack.us/img810/6278/habr4.png" alt="image"><br><br>  If for some reason you cannot cancel your subscription, we recommend contacting the customer support service of your mobile operator as soon as possible: <br>  (800) 333-0890 - MTS <br>  (495)974-8888 - Beeline Moscow and the region (specify the number in a particular region on the site beeline.ru) <br>  (800) 333-0500 - Megaphone <br><br>  So far we have found only 3 such domains.  Advertised in Yandex and Google. <br><br><img src="http://img820.imageshack.us/img820/1204/habr5.png" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>Addresses of fraudulent discount sites:</b> <br>  <s><a href="http://ruweb-ru.com/kupon/">ruweb-ru.com/kupon</a></s> <s><br></s>  <s><a href="http://rusonnline.com/kupon/">rusonnline.com/kupon</a></s> <s><br></s>  <s><a href="http://freedom-test.com/kupon/">freedom-test.com/kupon</a></s> (no longer available) <br><br>  For our part, we have already complained to Yandex and Google on these sites, so that their advertising is banned, since it‚Äôs not worthwhile to ‚Äútrash‚Äù the market and deceive trustful citizens, especially since most of the target audience in this niche is women. <br>  Perhaps we should unsubscribe an abuz back to smsdostup.ru, which provides them with a short number. <br><br>  ps Be always on the check, and trust only well-known sites with discounts!  ;) <br><br>  <b>update:</b> found a couple more domains <br>  <s>tagwhat.ru</s> <s><br></s>  <s>2011test.ru/kupon</s> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/124065/">https://habr.com/ru/post/124065/</a></p>
