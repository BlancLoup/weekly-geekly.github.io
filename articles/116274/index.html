By the way, the <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/ui/113035/">results of the survey on Habr√© are</a> pleasantly surprising.  Weigh all the pros and cons of specific examples before throwing slippers at the dissenting opponent.  As examples, the fictitious Democompany Corporation and its various projects, which to one degree or another use mailings to their users / clients, will be considered. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h1>  Democompany.com </h1><br>  First we consider the main site of the corporation democompany, which is a business card site and describes the main advantages of the company, a set of services, pricing, contact information and so on.  Also, this company likes to personalize its customers and asks them to register on the site as a client, indicating some information about themselves: name, surname, email, company, website. 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"

          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      In theory and at this stage, this registration gives the company an overall picture of its client, which allows him (the client) to write tickets to the company's support service.  Assessing the situation, we can say that the user can receive the following letters from the company: <br><br>  - Confirmation of registration on the site <br>  - Confirmation of changes in personal data <br>  - Notification that the client's ticket was sent to the support <br>  - Answer to the application <br>  - Confirmation of the decision / not addressing the issue of the application <br><br>  What we have?  Five letters of the same type, which can be arranged in plain / text like this: <br><br><blockquote><code><a href="http://www.democompany.com/"></a> , %firstname% %lastname%, <br> % //% <br> <br> ,    , <br> %operator_name%,   , <br> Democompany Ltd, www.democompany.com, +7(812)123 4567</code> </blockquote> <br>  or in HTML like this: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/8661ca56/784c7ca4/c44ffe40/f00b0f98.png"><br><br>  or even like this: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/9a3547b9/8486df9e/c5a4cbf4/361f570c.png"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/5c574018/dd27effb/f84c141e/c2093f6c.png"><br><br>  What can be said about these three options?  The first option is good because it performs its main function - to convey information to the client, without overloading him with unnecessary information.  The second option using HTML for markup solves a similar problem, but also emphasizes the company's corporate identity with light design.  The third option in this case is not so good, because it overloads the letter with its design, thereby distracting the addressee from the basic information, which is not so much.  In this case, do not turn the letter into a page of the site. <br><br>  For the above newsletters, I choose option # 2 with a touch of HTML. <br><br><h1>  Blog.democompany.com </h1><br>  Our invented corporation at the same time can have a blog in which it publishes interesting press releases and interesting articles on the subject of its business.  From here comes another source of email newsletters. <br><br>  Before I talk about him, I would like to make a small digression.  You do not have the right (well, at least from the ethical side) to make a periodic mailing to the user without his personal consent.  In the previous example, the consent of the user is not required, since committing his actions entails the generation of a message addressed to him.  In the case of periodicals, permission from the client is obtained in several ways: <br><br>  - When registering a user on the site, you can provide a point about your regular mailing.  The user must be able to unsubscribe, which means you should not operate on the fact that since the person is a client of the company, he is obliged to litter his mailbox. <br>  - Also on its website / blog Democompany places a form, filling in which the client can subscribe to the periodic mailing. <br>  - If the client did not deign to subscribe himself, an email is sent to the client, in which the company asks if%% username% wants to receive the newsletter?  And only after receiving the consent of a person is included in the mailing list.  But this does not mean that in the event of a person‚Äôs refusal, you should sign up with such offers weekly / daily. <br><br>  Another important point: the user must be able to independently unsubscribe from sending regular correspondence in the personal account on the site, as well as via the link from the received letter.  Moreover, clicking on the link for unsubscribing should not imply additional authorizations, the cancellation should be made directly, which is what many runet services sin. <br><br>  And so, what kind of newsletter can a client receive from the above blog? <br><br>  - The full text of news / articles at the time of publication <br>  - Title, announcement and link to the full text of news / articles at the time of publication <br>  - List of headlines, announcements and links to the full text of news / articles for a certain period <br>  - Notifications of new comments to the news / article that the user has already commented <br><br>  Ideally, to provide the user with the opportunity to select the frequency and format of messages, as well as a partial refusal (for example, from comments). <br><br>  I will give examples of plain / text versions of the above mailings. <br><br><h4>  Full text news </h4><br><blockquote> <code><a href="http://www.democompany.com/"></a> , %firstname% %lastname%, <br> <br>   , , Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry.

To some extent minimalistic HTML is more convenient, and to some extent more ‚Äúloaded‚Äù.  It seems to me that the choice will help determine the method of testing.  Send a newsletter in one style, send a newsletter in a different style.  Compare statistics, which letters were more attractive to most of your subscribers and led to the transition to the site, and which less.  Although comment notifications can be more categorically attributed to minimalism on the basis of notifications for democompany.com. <br><br><h1>  Shop.democompany.com </h1><br>  Here I will not torment you with an abundance of screenshots, because it is obvious that for marketing mailings it is necessary to resort exclusively to rich graphically html mailings.  Whether it is a commercial offer, a seasonal action, the sale of any product, you will not be able to interest the buyer in the text version of the letter.  Minimalism is acceptable in rare cases.  Although not so simple.  For a tick and for this moment I will give a number of mailings: <br><br>  - Advertising of goods, services and everything that you can advertise (this item falls into the category of HTML mailings only) <br><br>  The rest of the points rather fall under the controversial point, as it did with the Blog. <br><br>  - Checkout at the store <br>  - Confirmation of an order <br>  - Proof of payment <br>  - Customer service department (support) <br>  - Various notifications <br><br><h1>  Total </h1><br>  What can be said about all this?  Do you have a simple non-commercial service / community that does not sell any products and does not make regular mass mailings?  Plain / text or, at best, easy HTML to help you.  Solid company?  Pay a little attention to your style.  Marketplace, marketing giant?  HTML only!  And to what extent?  Study your target audience and be happy.  <a href="http://www.unisender.com/ru">Our service</a> will perfectly help you in conducting tests to study the target audience of your subscribers. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/116274/">https://habr.com/ru/post/116274/</a></p>
