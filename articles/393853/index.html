With the number of potential customers, the company miscalculated - Mask, by his own admission, the calculation went to the same tens of thousands, not hundreds.  Now the number of pre-orders has <a href="https://geektimes.ru/post/274002/">reached almost 400 thousand</a> , and continues to increase every day.  Mask is counting on half a million pre-orders for the summer.  All this is good, but the bottleneck here is the performance of the company's factories.  They do not even have time to cope with orders for Tesla Model X, which are not so many, what can we say about hundreds of thousands.

      In order to solve the problem, the company has <a href="http://recode.net/2016/05/04/elon-musk-tesla-manufacturing-earnings/">set a goal</a> - to increase production to 500,000 electric vehicles by 2018.  Earlier, a similar goal was set, only the date was different - 2020.  It is clear that in order to achieve this goal, a lot of work will have to be done - for everyone, the management, and ordinary employees.  Ilon Musk was so carried away by the process that, in his own words, he even sleeps in a factory. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  He and his team plan to become the best car makers in the world.  The team plans to recruit employees, and in the near future dozens (and maybe hundreds) of new vacancies will be opened. <br><br>  In this case, two top managers of the company - the vice president of production and vice president of products, left Tesla Motors several hours before Musk announced new plans.  It did not bother him, and now the head of Tesla Motors "assumes" that by 2020 the company will be able to ship already 1 million electric cars. <br><br>  As for the Model 3, it will start shipping it to customers no earlier than at the end of 2017.  No one can say whether Tesla is able to cope with such a load, despite the efforts of Mask.  It is possible that there will be deadlines.  According to Model X, the problems started already now, by the way - instead of 4500 electric vehicles, the company was able to deliver only 2400 in the first quarter. Tesla Motors failed to fulfill the general order, only 14,820 commercial vehicles were delivered.  But here we are talking about thousands of orders.  But in the case of Tesla Model 3, the bill goes to hundreds of thousands.  Perhaps, with the introduction of the Tesla Gigafabrika, the situation will improve. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/393853/">https://habr.com/ru/post/393853/</a></p>
