  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Microsoft Azure StorSimple: easy access to hybrid cloud. Part 1</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Data storage is one of the options that are best suited for hybrid solutions.  To date, we can recommend a great solution with a minimum configuration for novice users of cloud storage: <strong>Azure StorSimple</strong> .  This is the same product that Microsoft included in the program after it was absorbed by StorSimple in 2013, and which currently complements the Azure cloud services portfolio.  Since then, Microsoft has continuously worked to improve this product. <br><br>  In this post, we wanted to share with you our knowledge of how you can use StorSimple to adapt to rapidly growing amounts of data. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  What is Microsoft Azure StorSimple? </h2><br>  In general, Microsoft Azure StorSimple is a bridge between local storage networks in Microsoft Azure Cloud.  This method allows IT departments to guarantee their users the ability to store large amounts of information in the shortest possible time.  This feature can be deactivated as quickly as when it is activated. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/bed/7d9/496/bed7d94961f443bca0de7d26ed39dddf.jpg"></div><br>  If you look closely at the data warehouse, preparing for work in a shared internal IT system immediately makes it clear that the primary <b>working</b> data <b>set</b> (the data that users need in their daily work) is only a fraction of the data that the IT system actually needs use.

    <ul><li>  It is necessary to back up primary data in order to protect against data loss. </li><li>  They must be archived. </li><li>  They must be protected from natural disasters. </li><li>  They must be constantly available. </li></ul><br>  These requirements provoked a significant increase in data volumes.  The market is discussing the so-called double-digit growth, which causes considerable difficulties, the need to attract large investments, and also leads to heavy workload in the IT sector. <br><br><h2>  Is Microsoft Azure StorSimple a solution to this problem? </h2><br>  Microsoft StorSimple service solves this problem by storing the active working set on a locally installed storage device, while the information that is not currently used is sent in encrypted form to the Microsoft Azure Cloud cloud environment. <br><br>  Microsoft offers two options: <br><br><ol><li>  <strong>Microsoft StorSimple 8100</strong> provides 15 TB of storage on a local disk, which can be expanded to 40 TB using compression and deduplication.  Any additional requirements come from the Microsoft Azure Cloud cloud environment.  Thus, a memory size not exceeding 200 TB can be stored in the Microsoft StorSimple 8100 device. <br><br></li><li>  With just 4 units, the <strong>StorSimple 8600</strong> has a capacity of 500 TB, of which local memory is 40-100 TB.  The device connects exclusively through 1/10 GbE Ethernet iSCSI and comes bundled with fully redundant internal components to guarantee maximum power reserve. </li></ol><br>  At the moment, the opportunities provided by the Microsoft Azure Cloud cloud environment have become available and are now able to expand these basic functions.  It is in this role that this product is of particular interest.  All Microsoft StorSimple devices are managed using the StorSimple Manager in Microsoft Azure.  Simply put, you will not lose your time to master any complex local set of controls.  Moreover, you can take a snapshot of the entire set of data locally or in the cloud.  The advantage here is that the volumes located on the local device can be duplicated for testing purposes (for example, using Azure virtual machines).  If you can put it that way, it‚Äôs just as easy to back up all your data in <strong>Azure Backup Vault</strong> , recognizing the architecture of corporate tapes is suddenly outdated. <br><br>  Users are also protected from the complete loss of the data center location, as Azure StorSimple provides the virtual scenario application with access to data stored in <strong>Azure Blob Storage</strong> .  Data that was assigned a storage command in Azure is subsequently copied to a local surrogate device immediately after the company's location returns to online.  In addition, if necessary, data can be copied to different places.  Figuratively speaking, such storage can be called acting according to the Dropbox principle, although Microsoft will not be delighted with such a comparison. <br><br><h2>  What use cases are supposedly permissible for devices? </h2><br>  Let's start with a classic backup and recovery script.  Modern backup and recovery solutions, such as <strong><a href="http://www.comparex-group.com/web/ru/ru/resheniya-po-litsenzirovaniyu/partnery-i-postavshhiki/veeam.htm">Veeam</a></strong> , mostly use the amount of hard disk memory as data storage for backup.  StorSimple ensures that the current working dataset is available locally, ensuring the fastest possible recovery time.  In the end, access to the latest backups is required most often.  Archived backups (for example, monthly or annual backups) are automatically relegated to the background, since in most cases they will not be necessary. <br><br>  Classic <b>file management programs</b> are another use case that is key to any IT system.  Even if there are many other new approaches to collaboration today (for example, Sharepoint), file management programs will remain among the most important workflow management tools.  The device file management program, integrated into Microsoft StorSimple, provides access to the current working set of data in the local storage area, while ensuring quick response to requests.  In addition, data is subject to compression and deduplication.  All other data that is used less often is automatically transferred in encrypted form to the Azure Cloud environment.  This principle is used not only in the classic file management programs.  Even archives can be created this way. <br><br><h2>  What work assignments are supposedly not allowed? </h2><br>  First of all, the integrated solid-state drives are one of the outstanding devices, which guarantees a large number of I / O operations per second.  However, the hard disk configuration is static, so it will not be possible to add additional hard drives in the future to improve performance.  Moreover, StorSimple does not provide a wide range of administrative functions that would be familiar to users, for example, EMC VNX systems allow you to perform operations such as distributing data to segments, and also provide other services.  In most cases, such actions are performed automatically and the manager does not influence them in any way.  It is very important to check in advance whether any VMware cluster of medium size or SQL database can be stored in StorSimple. <br><br><h2>  Conclusion </h2><br>  Not every scenario will need a high-tech storage solution.  The StorSimple storage device allows its users to reduce overall costs while remaining user-friendly.  Moreover, companies that have already entered into <strong><a href="http://www.comparex-group.com/web/ru/enterprise-agreement/licenses/enterprise-agreement/enterprise-agreement.htm">an Enterprise Agreement</a></strong> (EA) with Microsoft, including a mandatory Azure payment, will find that storage equipment is provided for free, not counting the mandatory Azure payment of 50,000 euros. <br><br><h2>  Latest Developments </h2><br>  Microsoft guarantees that the product meets all the latest requirements: in addition to regularly updating existing functions, the company introduces completely new core functions.  For example, a virtual array is available for StorSimple from the beginning of March.  Generally speaking, the product is no longer a hardware device, but takes the form of a virtual device that functions as virtual memory in Hyper-V or <strong><a href="http://www.comparex-group.com/web/ru/ru/resheniya-po-litsenzirovaniyu/spetsialnye-predlozheniya/vmware-nsx.htm">VMware</a></strong> .  Such a virtual array can provide iSCSI or SMB shared resources. <br><br>  Without going into details, StorSimple provides an outstanding product with the minimum configuration necessary to start working with hybrid cloud scripts, especially when concluding a Microsoft EA agreement in parallel.  In the future, it will help undecided companies to overcome the first difficulties on the way to the cloud environment.  Installation takes only one day. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/308956/">https://habr.com/ru/post/308956/</a></p>
