      Sony Xperia J is a follower of the traditions of the Sony ARC-series as evidenced by the concave back cover of the smartphone.  Actually the design is almost the main advantage of the device.  Due to the concavity of the back cover, the smartphone is very comfortable and confident in the hand. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/7e7/b97/3a4/7e7b973a40505757e37fad615c2fdbae.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  By the highlight of the design of this smartphone is attributed to the light on the lower end of the fire.  And the light of this light changes depending on the chosen theme of the smartphone interface design.  On the right side are the volume rocker and the display lock button, it is the on / off button.  With regards to this latter, I would like to note that, in my opinion, it is too small and recessed into the body.  On the other hand, it insures against involuntary clicks.  However, all the buttons are quite tight, so, I think, there would be no involuntary clicks and so, protrude the lock button above the case more clearly and being bigger. <br><br>  The physical camera control button, unlike the flagship Sony models, is not here, but in its place is a recess, behind which the back cover should be hooked.  At the top of the left end is a micro-USB connector for charging, which is not always convenient. <br><br>  The front panel does not represent anything fundamentally original: above the display is the main speaker, proximity and lighting sensors, indicator of missed calls and messages, as well as 0.3 MP camera for video telephony.  Below the display are three touch-sensitive interface control buttons and a microphone.  The display is covered with a protective Gorilla Glass, as in "adult" smartphones. <br><br>  Display Sony Xperia J manufactured by TFT technology.  Alas, it is not as wonderful as the Xperia S Super LCD display, for example.  And the matter is not even in more contrasting colors, to which not only one can get used, but also that someone may like even more than the soft, pastel colors of the Xperia S display. The point is much more serious characteristic: response time.  Personally, it seemed to me that the response time of the Xperia J display was somehow too long.  However, perhaps, it‚Äôs not just the quality of the display, but also the budget hardware stuffing of the smartphone. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/960/379/bf5/960379bf5d80a066b616ff1e335a4dba.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/a88/f2e/9f2/a88f2e9f25baa1e5f0fb253f1fea33a8.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Xperia J is based on a single-core Qualcomm MSM7227A processor operating at 1 GHz.  This is a fairly common and well-proven processor for low-cost mobile solutions of the sample of 2010.  His work space is provided by 512 MB of RAM, and the Adreno 200 coprocessor is responsible for graphics. The budget is extremely low for Android ICS.  In combination with the not the fastest TFT-display, it seems to give an uncomfortable effect of a retarded response. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/a4b/5f9/ae6/a4b5f9ae6123edc4c253638f85ac9fa5.png" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/c19/9f9/a08/c199f9a0890c184adb26b844d0b46216.png" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/b00/c06/270/b00c062706a84e2bee135a0017cecaa9.png" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/b34/5f3/835/b345f38351ddab8cbade8f5ad13d454f.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Sony smartphones are famous for their cameras.  The same classic flagship Xperia S carries a 12 megapixel camera, which perfectly photographs and quite acceptable shoots video.  However, alas, Xperia J is equipped with only 5 megapixel main camera, which, if you take pictures with an aspect ratio of 16: 9, it does use only 3 megapixels.  As a result, the photos are very, very average, and with general plans they are bad at all.  Even for social networks with modern average quality of smartphones, such photos obviously will not cause delight.  Video this camera shoots with a resolution of 640x480 and at a speed of 30 frames per second, which is also unlikely to move to praise.  Perhaps the only thing that pleasantly surprised me was the very small focal length of the camera: it focuses at least 5 cm from the object being photographed.  If at the same time the object is removed with a 4: 3 aspect ratio, then in principle interesting pictures can turn out. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/be7/7c4/806/be77c4806ed695bfb7c80e59a74af3eb.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/6f1/8e4/b94/6f18e4b942c843074ecbf0edcaa6e05a.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/8c5/2d2/883/8c52d28832370866adb8e3ec595a6461.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/c1a/971/344/c1a97134434b17f05cc667be75a0a8c2.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/f17/5b8/95e/f175b895ed0be3c1dc77074f960aa873.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  video tests: <br><br>  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3D-qG3cqqrM2U">www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qG3cqqrM2U</a> <br><br>  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DTIC2C4Qz_KU">www.youtube.com/watch?v=TIC2C4Qz_KU</a> <br><br>  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3Dg43piybwD70">www.youtube.com/watch?v=g43piybwD70</a> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/967/b87/9d1/967b879d1db17845cc7e3627b3b3124d.png" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/5be/d99/980/5bed99980bf950b60ecad02fd459c20e.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Along with the above-described very average hardware characteristics, it is worth noting that the duration of the smartphone on a 1700 mAh battery is very, very good.  For a week of using the device, he never demanded recharging during the day.  Another thing is that on such hardware the range of use of the device is also reduced, and if you browse the Internet on Xperia J, in principle, you can, then you can play games, only in the most simple ones.  However, owners of Xperia J will be exempt from wearing charging. <br><br>  Of course, I did not quite correctly compare the above flagship Xperia S and the described model Xperia J. These are two devices of completely different levels.  However, the fact of the matter is that they are actually the same.  Even the formal difference of 1-2 thousand rubles, which is between ‚Äúeskoy‚Äù and ‚ÄúJay‚Äù, in my opinion, pushes to choose on the Xperia S. This is a magnificent, which has already become a classic flagship, though not on 4-core, but on a 2-core processor, but quite comfortable to use. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/181/b6f/a79/181b6fa7902cd934a1c3258333691c05.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  As for soft stuffing, here Xperia J formally repeats Xperia S. The Android ICS customization is probably the best on the market with several very convenient and pleasant proprietary applications, among which the Walkman player with built-in equalizer, the ability to view and listen to the tracks that your friends on Facebook and other amenities listen to. <br><br>  However, in Xperia S there is such a media player, so, I repeat, I do not see any reason why a user who chooses to purchase a smartphone on Android for about 10-12 thousand should choose Xperia J, not Xperia S. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/157507/">https://habr.com/ru/post/157507/</a></p>
