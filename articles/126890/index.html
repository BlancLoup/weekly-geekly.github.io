  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Stages of development of the company in terms of IT</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Any company seeks to develop and increase profitability.  If she has at the same time at least one computer, then developing it goes through several stages.  Everyone knows that there is such a thing as ITIL.  Many even read :) But the intrigue is to draw the right parallels between ITIL and real life - otherwise it will all remain a dead weight in the head of the manager.  In ITIL, these steps are defined as the Organization Maturity.  Now they will be discussed. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  It is logical to start with the first stage (although of course it would be more fun to start with the fourth and finish the second).  Looking ahead, we admit that we ourselves are not in the fifth stage;  but at the moment we are stabilizing the fourth - so there is some experience. <br>  <b>The first stage</b> is Technology Driven.  Roughly speaking, the company at this stage has no idea what it needs.  Therefore, the technology used by the IT department will be used - that is, in practice, the first one that comes across.  As a result, some accidentally hired junior administrator tells the head of the sales department how to sell, and the accounting department how to keep the ledger.  He does this tritely because he is the only person who understands anything about this technology.  At the same time, it‚Äôs not at all a fact that they understand a lot, and not a fact that it is suitable for you at all.  There is no serious analysis of technologies necessary and optimal for business, not to mention services.  There are plenty of examples - in the companies of the First Stage it is impossible to sell more than five hundred units of products just because the maximum number in the field of the accounting program is 500. Business loses flexibility, business loses money.  Nothing good, right? <br><br>  <b>The second stage</b> .  Technology Control.  The first competent administrator comes to the company and starts by drawing a diagram of technologies that you already use on a piece of paper.  And then begins to work with them tightly - and voila, removes the limit of five hundred units.  His Majesty's backup comes to the company, and in general life is somehow getting better ... but not quite.  Because it turns out that only those technologies in which that First Literate is interested are developing.  He is interested in exchange, so sendmail will not be here, and vice versa.  If he is an adherent of software firewalls, then the hardware in the company will not take root.  And these are berries, because if a company has two branches, there is the prospect of hiring two administrators with opposing religious views.  And then you will have both hardware and software.  At this stage, the company is already effectively using the technologies available or offered by it, but is not yet specifically analyzing the effectiveness of the entire infrastructure and its relationship with the business. <br>  It should be noted here that all this is not happening from malicious intent, and not from the incompetence of administrators.  This is not the problem.  The problem is that the company is missing something.  This ‚Äúsomething‚Äù is the absence of an eye on business.  Everyone is thinking about how to debug a certain technology to shine - but no one thinks that a business may need a completely different one.

      Technology Integration - the <b>third stage</b> .  Finally, effective connections between various technologies appear in the company.  The company not only understands that it has the infrastructure - but also begins to realize it, classify, analyze.  Users see some strange people scheduling checks for equipment - it happened, now we have a database of equipment.  Upon scanning ports, the firewall sends the log via e-mail, which in turn puts it into the database - and from there the staff works with it via the Service Desk interface.  It is clear that there is some kind of trick here - everything seems to be fine, and the stage is only the third.  You don‚Äôt have to wait long: your wonderful sharepoint-portal falls miserably, and it turns out that the backups you had ... didn‚Äôt have them in general.  Suddenly it turns out that in the budget of the IT department there is no money to purchase additional licenses for the DBMS, but the entire warehouse is swamped with new cisco. <br>  The problem with this stage is the imbalance in the growth of IT infrastructure costs, and the lack of a full-fledged connection with the business.  One of the main reasons for this is the lack of effective analysis of the infrastructure, the ongoing and necessary processes in IT.  In the final result, this leads to the same loss of money ... business again suffered. <br><br>  And then came <b>the fourth stage</b> , Service Provision.  On it, someone came up with the significant word ‚Äúservice‚Äù.  Moreover, he came up with certain requirements for these services.  The company's work begins to be associated with ... again with the service.  What is it all about?  Apparently, service is a mixture of technology with a business goal.  That is, if the company hosted a web page on apache, now it provides a blog service with integration into all popular social networks and full support under the contract.  Business won, customer base expanded.  There was technology, service became.  But still something is missing.  Not enough experience with the service.  Despite the fact that it is already for sale, it lacks efficiency - and the user feels it. <br>  At this stage, companies do not have enough evaluation of the effectiveness of the provision of services according to the expectations of customers.  Not all services are provided with the necessary margin of availability, not all services that are necessary for business or end customers are provided.  Analysis of the demand and level of provision of services is not performed effectively enough, in places it may be completely absent. <br>  Among the companies of the fourth stage, there are a lot of Internet providers, who have a service like that, and the Internet works ... but somewhere with speed problems, and somewhere with service availability.  There are many web studios among them, in whom the contract is merely a formality, and the task is carried out as far as it turns out, not always conforming to what was requested.  This group includes many banks, outsourcers, web services, communications providers. <br><br>  <b>As for the fifth stage</b> - here comes the common good.  Here it is, Strategic Contribution: overall strategic planning finally emerges - both business and IT.  At this stage, the company is planning the future - simply because she has been fine with the present for a long time.  This is what we should strive for ... and we are striving.  :) <br><br>  In general, it is no secret that the market is full of companies that are at best not the third stage.  So we all wish to reach the fifth level, and without loss in the number of personnel :) As for the article, then if someone is interested in reading about the stages of development in more detail - in the Service Operation of the ITIL Framework, this is described in more detail. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/126890/">https://habr.com/ru/post/126890/</a></p>
