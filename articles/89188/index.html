  <section class="page js-page"><h1>New HP, now with aluminum</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  A year ago, acquired on the occasion of MSI U100.  I can say that it suited me perfectly both in terms of compactness and in functions and in terms of battery life.  For all the time, there were only two notes to it: a very small screen (so the eyes got tired quickly) and a stripped-down Bluetooth module, because of which I could not update the firmware in the Parrot 3200 speakerphone module, I had to connect a large laptop for this task.  But a year has passed, and I decided to update it. <a name="habracut"></a>  Having prepared MSI for a meeting with the new owner, he went to the store, preparing for the agony of choice.  To the surprise there was no agony, since the choice immediately fell on the recently introduced ASUS 1201n.  Taking a box with a netbook went home, deal with the acquisition.  Reviews on Habr√© of this device were pieces 4, for example <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/netbook/86809/">1</a> , <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/netbook/82993/">2</a> or <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/netbook/75789/">3</a> .  But, looking ahead, I will say right away that after two weeks I returned it back.  What did not suit me in it?  First gloss, solid and terrible.  Secondly, it was very hot, even without any tasks, after booting the system, after about 5 minutes, the very warm air started to blow out of the grates and the case from the bottom also heated up very much.  Thirdly, the power connector is non-standard and very thin.  It is necessary to move the netbook from the spot and the contact disappeared, respectively, the battery charge stopped.  In general, I collected it back, restored the factory settings and carried it back with a light heart, deciding to throw a net a second time.  And this time the catch was no less fresh HP Pavilion dm3-1145er. <img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/2d/36/2d364b016f805c908410631816fbea88.jpg" alt="image">  True, he is not quite a netbook. <br>  Here are its characteristics: <br><br><br>  CPU <br>  Manufacturer   Intel <br>  Title   Core ‚Ñ¢ 2Duo <br>  Processor brand   SU7300 <br>  Frequency   1.3 GHz <br>  Core   2 <br>  Cache   3 Mb   Chipset   Intel¬Æ GS45 Express <br>  Memory <br>  Memory type   DDR II <br>  RAM size   4096 MB <br>  HDD <br>  Hard Drive Size (GB)   320 <br>  Spindle speed   7200 rpm <br>  operating system <br>  operating system   Microsoft Windows 7 Home Premium <br>  Drive unit <br>  type of drive   External DVD-RW Super-multi <br><br>  Video card <br>  Manufacturer   nVidia <br>  Title   GeForce G105 <br>  Own memory   512 <br>  Screen <br>  Screen size   13.3 " <br>  Resolution   1366x768 (16: 9) <br>  FullHD   Yes (on external monitor) <br>  Connection <br>  Network   10/100/1000 Mbit <br>  WiFi   there is

A full-fledged processor and the ability to use both a video card from Intel and a discrete from NVidia.  4 Gig of RAM and 64-bit operating system included.  Hard disk capacity of 320 GB and 7200 r / m.  Only the frame around the display and the display itself remain of the gloss: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/09/a3/09a3d22e26efae51ffd3392f3a9b4c59.jpg" alt="image"><br>  Most importantly, the laptop case is almost entirely aluminum. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/e8/e7/e8e71566cc9c2772f365229919f367aa.jpg" alt="image"><br>  (there is still a film on the lid, it gives a highlight) And so the laptop turns out to be pleasantly heavy, slightly cool to the touch, and without a continuous gloss. <br>  On the right are the power switch, Wi-Fi / Bluetooth switch, 2 USB ports, ventilation grille and Kensington Lock <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/af/0e/af0eafc62b4b93ca45ecfe77e1be6087.jpg" alt="image"><br>  On the left are the microphone and headphone jacks, a card reader, again 2 USB ports, an HDMI output, a D-SUB, a network connector and a power connector. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/0e/c3/0ec3bb413be5e3082d21675b6c4a3f4a.jpg" alt="image"><br>  The keyboard of the now familiar look with square keys is quite large and comfortable, only the cursor keys are a bit unusual.  Function keys are enabled by default in multimedia mode, but those who basically need F1-F12 keys (like me) can return this mode of operation by setting in the BIOS.  The touchpad is slightly depressed, which allows you to feel its edges (unlike the ASUS 1201), with multitouch support. <br>  Included with the laptop is only one disk, it contains a User Manual.  Therefore, to restore the laptop is recommended to immediately make discs, which would require 3 blank DVD discs.  And you can write them on an external drive that comes in the kit, by the way with the support of the Lightscribe function <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/00/4f/004f103df73110162df7db917091dbb2.jpg" alt="image"><br>  The laptop also has a function similar to the Express Gate from Asus. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/69/73/69731d4b0c88c731c9c52545c02cbe27.jpg" alt="image"><br>  And when you turn on the laptop, we can, without downloading the main OS, wander around on an Internet, see pictures, listen to music, view mail or our tasks in the Google calendar, well, or chat on Skype or ICQ.  In general, all that you may need for entertaining pastime. <br>  The main OS additionally has a media player from HP, a set of online toys, trial versions of Norton Antivirus 2010 and MS Office 2007, utilities for Lightscribe and a certain Magic Desktop - a software shell for children that have programs for learning, drawing, playing music and walking around. Internet control content.  If anyone is interested, I can then consider it in more detail. <br>  Here are the results of the HD Speed ‚Äã‚Äãdisc test. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/5d/4c/5d4c5e457a6996250b804273d68700e5.jpg" alt="image"><br>  In general, at the moment I am quite happy with my purchase, and I am quietly engaged in its improvement for my needs <br>  Add a picture of the results of the program BatteryEatter <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/87/4e/874eec428d0d435c6251e47c76c1a94e.jpg" alt="image"><br>  The battery still has 9% of the charge, all the time the display was turned on at full brightness and the Wi-Fi module was working.  Total time in this mode 3.5 hours </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/89188/">https://habr.com/ru/post/89188/</a></p>
