She offers a <a href="http://mashable.com/2013/06/08/leave-your-job">list of eight signs</a> that it‚Äôs time for you to change jobs and find a new occupation that will satisfy your life values ‚Äã‚Äãand bring you pleasure. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/aee/6a0/415/aee6a0415eae1b06d5bc1f9fd3ba3de9.png" width="500" alt="image"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  1. Your relationship with your boss has changed. </h4><br>  For several years you had a fabulous job, an excellent relationship with your boss, but now you have begun to feel changes in the culture of the organization and in the authorities.  You are asked to take more responsibility and do more for the company with the same resources.  You feel you have lost support in this company. <br><br><h4>  2. Work and life values ‚Äã‚Äãno longer match. </h4><br>  When you got into the company, you understood its role in this world, and it coincided with your life values.  But now this job does not satisfy you.  Culture has changed, or you cannot show your full potential.  Ask yourself: if today you were interviewed for this position, would you go to work for your company?

    <h4>  3. You have ceased to participate in meetings where the company makes important decisions. </h4><br>  The company makes business decisions that you disagree with.  You have lost influence on management and are no longer up to date.  Managers consult with other people about making decisions that undermine your authority. <br><br><h4>  4. You stopped doing important tasks. </h4><br>  Your bosses began to work directly with your subordinates around you.  Your team is divided.  You are no longer appointed as a manager for significant projects. <br><br><h4>  5. You are disappointed with the company's strategy. </h4><br>  The company is changing its focus and you do not support this decision.  You began to actively express your disagreement.  Your contribution to the organization‚Äôs work has ceased to appreciate leadership because it hears dissent in your position. <br><br><h4>  6. You wake up in the middle of the night in a cold sweat and replay the dialogues in your head </h4><br>  Huge responsibility, tight deadlines and disputes with the manager cause stress, which already affects night sleep.  You do not get enough sleep and can not work at full strength - the circle is closed. <br><br><h4>  7. You are more involved in policy management than in your own work. </h4><br>  There are rumors that a company can be bought, and now "every man for himself."  This setup does not allow you to work productively.  By the end of the week, you notice that you have spent more time managing your own status than closing your current tasks. <br><br><h4>  8. You do not want to go to work in the morning </h4><br>  You wake up in the morning full of energy, happily go to the office, anticipating new achievements?  Or every day you force yourself to get out of bed, pour in coffee and go to work, dragging your legs, asking yourself the question - ‚ÄúDo I need it‚Äù?  If your brain says it's time to move on, you can at least listen to it and try to find another activity. <br><br><h4>  What signs from this list do you feel on yourself? </h4></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/295298/">https://habr.com/ru/post/295298/</a></p>
