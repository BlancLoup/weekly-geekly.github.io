Although at the start the dynamics were rather sluggish, at the end the flow exceeded all our expectations - <a href="https://dribbble.com/shots/2076172-Mail-Ru-Dribbble-Competition-Submission-Closed">54 designers</a> !  We got a lot of fresh insights on how to develop the functions of working with attachments in the product.  And yet - a good experience in conducting competitions. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img width="150" height="181" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/213/d55/988/213d559887abc909c347d368a4511b29.png" alt="Mailing app on Dribbble"></div><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h2>  Task </h2><br>  We <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/mailru/blog/258943/">announced the contest on May 23</a> at the <a href="http://www.jvetrau.com/dribbbleru-2015">Moscow Dribbble Meetup 2015</a> , which we have been <a href="http://www.jvetrau.com/dribbbleru-2015">holding</a> for the fourth year already.  The task was as follows:

      <em>The letters receive a lot of useful information - photos and documents, information about events, contact information, information about booking tickets and hotels, checks about purchases in online stores.</em>  <em>In the standard form of the list of letters it is not very convenient to find them, and the search here rarely helps.</em> <em><br><br></em>  <em>Imagine that there is an application in which all mail attachments from your mail are conveniently represented.</em>  <em>In it you can look at information by type, title, linking to time and place, specific correspondence, life stories, projects, and maybe other contexts.</em>  <em>Design and draw the main screens of this application for Android or iOS, to choose from.</em>  <em>It‚Äôs not necessary to rely on the current Mail.Ru design - fresh visual solutions will get more points.</em> <br><br><img src="https://scontent-ams2-1.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xtf1/v/t1.0-9/11055271_10152782318806856_4416041049708867318_n.jpg?oh=b1d3e098f5900a5d2107d8d0117e9f85&amp;oe=56612443"><br><br><h3>  Why do we need it? </h3><br>  For us, this is a great opportunity to look at the services of the company through the eyes of people from outside.  We have a fairly strong team, which is immersed in all the nuances of the products.  But this has a downside - the pressure of technological and business constraints.  We use a lot of internal techniques and practices to get around them.  Contests - one of them.  So, Odnoklassniki have been conducting the <a href="http://russiandesigncup.ru/">Russian Design Cup</a> since 2012, where participants solve problems close to reality.  And we have been interacting with the <a href="http://britishdesign.ru/">British for a</a> long time, where, as part of the intensives and core courses, students also work on real Mail.Ru Group products. <br><br> <a href="http://russiandesigncup.ru/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a1e/f3c/30f/a1ef3c30f3dd7fac159e778ce6f50888.jpg" alt="Russian Design Cup"></a> <br><br> <a href="http://www.britishdesign.ru/programs/p/uxdesign2/"><img src="https://scontent-ams2-1.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ash2/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/10940511_764977590256776_4201729908094120347_n.jpg?oh=7a6be0693be0f14f5f6a900c37460abe&amp;oe=566E54A7"></a> <br><br>  We do not expect that we will get a ready-made breakthrough solution on a saucer for relatively little money - this is impossible without deep immersion in the product.  Therefore, for us, competitive works are a kind of ‚Äúbridge‚Äù that allows you to look at parts of a product from a different angle and, by adding up individual solutions from there with your own workings, you can get a good solution for a particular functionality.  In fact - Brainstorm with the design community. <br><br><h2>  Solutions </h2><br>  Before the start of the competition, we had an idea of ‚Äã‚Äãwhat a good decision could be.  And after a close communication with students of the <a href="http://www.britishdesign.ru/programs/p/uxdesign2/">summer intensity of the British on the UX / UI,</a> it became even clearer.  As a product, Mail.Ru Mail will benefit from the fact that users will be able to get more benefit from working with an archive of attachments that come with letters.  This can be achieved in three ways: <br><br><ol><li>  Highlight attachments right in the list of letters.  This is perfectly solved in the mailbox Inbox, and with some of them actions can be performed right there without leaving the inbox. </li><li>  A separate section with navigation and search for attachments from letters.  Such a function for several years already exists in the web version of Mail.Ru Mail.  Interestingly, Yandex came from the other side - it made it an automatic folder in Disk. </li><li>  Automatic collection of investments in "threads" and "threads threads": for example, a trip or all the files on the project.  We removed this hint from the task shortly after the announcement - we wanted the participants to come to her themselves.  Although literally a week later, work with travel was shown in the Inbox. </li></ol><br><br>  Therefore, we evaluated all solutions primarily by how well the authors worked on these components.  Naturally, the quality of visual design and reasonableness of the interface logic were taken into account.  Separate ideas, effective presentation and thoughtfulness of the concept description were also taken into account. <br><br><h3>  Jury </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f42/f9f/d0b/f42f9fd0b6594edb9286a5fcff878dca.jpg" alt="Slava Yashkov (Mail.Ru Group)"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/375/6a4/1b4/3756a41b4435483fa42215649a641baf.jpg" alt="Konstantin Zubanov (Mail.Ru Group)"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/45c/83a/d19/45c83ad196eb442bbb4c0b0a0c86942d.jpg" alt="Ivan Myzdrikov (Mail.Ru Group)"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a81/899/3f9/a818993f9759456b9ee2a603e6c05e77.jpg" alt="Boris Nikiforov (Mail.Ru Group)"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e2c/074/0a4/e2c0740a42b34af0a77dc73da5f02edb.jpg" alt="Alexey Sergeev (Mail.Ru Group)"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e3e/c61/986/e3ec61986d4f4101b8b93026930356e7.jpg" alt="Yuri Vetrov (Mail.Ru Group)"><br><br>  The work was evaluated by designers and managers of Mobile Mail - Slava Yashkov (iOS designer), Kostya Zubanov (Android designer), Ivan Myzdrikov (product manager), Boris Nikiforov (head of mobile direction), as well as Alexey Sergeev (deputy vice president) and I (the head of the portal design team).  We could evaluate ideas from three sides - the quality of design and interface, business value and technological feasibility. <br><br>  But in order to get an outside view, and here, having made the assessments more objective, we asked <a href="http://www.tematroinoi.com/">Artem Triple</a> to join the jury.  He is the best suited for this role - a young but very promising designer who has become widely known for his <a href="http://nytimes.tematroinoi.com/">redesign concept for the New York Times</a> . <br><br><blockquote> <strong>Artem Triple</strong> : I really like design competitions.  There are no restrictions.  On them, the designer grows independently and moves the design industry forward.  You can think of a spaceship.  It often happens that the wing from such a ship will be used in a real project.  In this competition, I liked that there were quite a lot of good ideas. </blockquote><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/368/854/db4/368854db455b499fb4fbd6df8445097a.jpg" alt="Artem Triple"><br><br><h3>  Works </h3><br>  We received work from 54 designers.  Someone downloaded several versions of his decision, but we took the latter into account in the assessment.  In general, there was something to see.  True, almost no one got into our idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe ideal interface for this task (see 3 methods above), so we began to sort out the concepts into separate interesting ideas. <br><br> <a href="https://dribbble.com/shots/2076172-Mail-Ru-Dribbble-Competition-Submission-Closed/rebounds"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/784/0d3/512/7840d35121a65653ea887c019da97608.png" alt="Entries"></a> <br><br><h4>  Attachment List </h4><br>  One of the key screens of the application is the list of attachments in different variations.  The type of tile, of course, is the most colorful - there is a place to roam, there is enough space for a spectacular presentation of information about the file.  The best design looks like <a href="https://dribbble.com/shots/2196885-Mail-ru-Dribbble-Competition">Sergey Mekryukov</a> - an irregular grid, in which an attachment can have three types (large, medium, small) - like tiles in Windows 8. Addressees are displayed next to the files. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/lI9r2ITRlCY%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700021,15700186,15700190,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhjzC19vyOR5drMpsFqfocfFsNiU_w" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  The first idea to display the addressee on the file tile was suggested by <a href="https://dribbble.com/shots/2091729-Parse-Mail-Ru">Kirill Kovalsky</a> - this is a small badge in the form of an avatar, something like Facebook messenger.  Later she met in many papers.  Simple, but very nice tiles came from <a href="https://dribbble.com/shots/2115949-Android-app-concept-for-mail-ru">Andrei Novozhilov</a> , more colorful - from <a href="https://dribbble.com/shots/2177147-Concept-app-for-mail-ru-competition">Arsen Kolyba</a> .  Several designers at once drew a letter in the form of a tile with an attachment - <a href="https://dribbble.com/shots/2175138-Concept-for-Mail-ru-competition">Ilyas Aliyev</a> (beautiful!), <a href="https://dribbble.com/shots/2194255-Mail-ru-Mobile-App-Concept">Ksenia Butyrina</a> and <a href="https://dribbble.com/shots/2197590-mail-ru-concept">Zhenya &amp; Artem</a> . <br><br> <a href="https://dribbble.com/shots/2175138-Concept-for-Mail-ru-competition"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/98b/b30/719/98bb307194aa605de2741e087aaa3a8b.png" alt="Ilyas Aliyev"></a> <br><br>  The vertical list of attachments turned out well in <a href="https://dribbble.com/shots/2130625--Mail-Ru">Artem Magomaev</a> .  A lot of useful information is derived from <a href="https://dribbble.com/shots/2197719--Mail-ru">Alexey Kamensky</a> , <a href="https://dribbble.com/shots/2153109-Attach-master-app-design-for-Mail-Ru-competition">Alex RSR</a> and <a href="https://dribbble.com/shots/2136973-Mail-ru-Files">Denis Matveyev</a> .  But the most pleasant, probably, in the work of <a href="https://dribbble.com/shots/2195789-Mail-ru-Competition">Shakuro</a> . <br><br> <a href="https://dribbble.com/shots/2195789-Mail-ru-Competition"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/099/6be/5b7/0996be5b7b4cdb9fb945251a662f743c.png" alt="Shakuro: Attachment List"></a> <a href="https://dribbble.com/shots/2197719--Mail-ru"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/499/566/049/4995660493101a3c561b212058805e2a.png" alt="Alexey Kamensky: List of attachments"></a> <br><br> <a href="https://dribbble.com/shots/2136973-Mail-ru-Files"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/78c/c46/3f8/78cc463f80a65c6ce02af9c7b314e5d4.png" alt="Denis Matveyev: List of attachments"></a> <a href="https://dribbble.com/shots/2130625--Mail-Ru"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c1d/959/188/c1d95918821a72b95dc4afeb381c1641.png" alt="Artem Magomaev: List of attachments"></a> <br><br>  The combined version of the list can be noted in <a href="https://dribbble.com/shots/2118681-MFL-Mail-Files-Manager-mail-ru">Ivan Ledkov</a> - grouping by type and date;  and <a href="https://dribbble.com/shots/2115949-Android-app-concept-for-mail-ru">Andrei Novozhilova</a> - tricky grouping by contact, date and file type. <br><br>  According to the presentation of the attachments inside the letter, the works of <a href="https://dribbble.com/shots/2201632-mail-ru-concept">Denis Mihutin</a> and <a href="https://dribbble.com/shots/2197590-mail-ru-concept">Zhenya &amp; Artem</a> look good. <br><br><h4>  Screen attachment </h4><br>  He was shown many works, but in a completely basic form - <a href="https://dribbble.com/shots/2091729-Parse-Mail-Ru">Kirill Kovalsky</a> , <a href="https://dribbble.com/shots/2115949-Android-app-concept-for-mail-ru">Andrey Novozhilov</a> , <a href="https://dribbble.com/shots/2118681-MFL-Mail-Files-Manager-mail-ru">Ivan Ledkov</a> , <a href="https://dribbble.com/shots/2127235-Mail-Ru-Dribble-Competition-Manage-your-attachments">Nazar Moravsky</a> , <a href="https://dribbble.com/shots/2136973-Mail-ru-Files">Denis Matveyev</a> , <a href="https://dribbble.com/shots/2143656-Mail-ru-app-concept">RedLab</a> , <a href="https://dribbble.com/shots/2197576-Mailutilus-App-Profile-Search-for-Mail-Ru-Contest">Ivan Mosievsky</a> , <a href="https://dribbble.com/shots/2146867-Mail-Ru-Dribbble-Competition">Mikhail Voropaev</a> , <a href="https://dribbble.com/shots/2153109-Attach-master-app-design-for-Mail-Ru-competition">Alex RSR</a> , <a href="https://dribbble.com/shots/2177147-Concept-app-for-mail-ru-competition">Arsen Kolyba</a> , <a href="https://dribbble.com/shots/2188875-Attachments-Mail-ru">Maria Gordeychik</a> , <a href="https://dribbble.com/shots/2191102-Mail-ru-attachment-app">Alexander Starodubtsev</a> , <a href="https://dribbble.com/shots/2191914-Mail-Ru-Dribbble-Competition-Mobile-App">Darina Turkovsky</a> , <a href="https://dribbble.com/shots/2192495-attachment-mail-ru">Alexander Pesenko</a> , <a href="https://dribbble.com/shots/2194255-Mail-ru-Mobile-App-Concept">Ksenia Butyrina</a> , <a href="https://dribbble.com/shots/2197152-Atwork-app-working-with-mail-attachment">Alexander Hive</a> , <a href="https://dribbble.com/shots/2197590-mail-ru-concept">Zhenya &amp; Artyom</a> , <a href="https://dribbble.com/shots/2197719--Mail-ru">Alexey Kamensky</a> , <a href="https://dribbble.com/shots/2201738-Work-for-Mail-ru-Dribbble-Competition">Alexey Weinberg</a> , <a href="https://dribbble.com/shots/2216797-Mail-ru-Dribbble-Competition">Andrey Bugash</a> .  Interesting was the property panel in the <a href="https://dribbble.com/shots/2195789-Mail-ru-Competition">Shakuro</a> concept and navigation through the investments of <a href="https://dribbble.com/shots/2165396-Mail-ru-app">Roman Gordienko</a> . <br><br><h4>  event Ribbon </h4><br>  To handle all types of events - meetings, flights, movie tickets, etc., a number of participants suggested something like a calendar in the form of a chronological tape.  Someone, like <a href="https://dribbble.com/shots/2198032-Mail-ru">Martiros Badishyan</a> , showed a variant similar to the first version of the Facebook timeline.  Someone, like <a href="https://dribbble.com/shots/2144451-Mail-ru-Contest">Artem Triple</a> , brought up QR codes for tickets for faster access - if you refine the idea, you‚Äôll have something like a passbook from iOS. <br><br> <a href="https://dribbble.com/shots/2198032-Mail-ru"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/49d/cea/5e8/49dcea5e8f243a8fe36014cf8457295d.png" alt="Martiros Badishyan: Tape of events"></a> <br><br><blockquote>  <strong>Kostya Zubanov</strong> : A neat visual work that did not quite fall under the theme of the competition (no attention was paid to working with attachments). </blockquote><br><blockquote>  <strong>Slava Yashkov</strong> : One of the many works that the designer worked on was looking in the direction of Inbox.  The only interesting thing is to move the action buttons with letters to the top, away from the thumb. </blockquote><br><h4>  "Projects" </h4><br>  The third way to implement the task is the most interesting.  In addition to recreating a simple file browser, you can analyze their source and content, the context of correspondence and the relatedness of recipients.  The simplest thing is to combine armor tickets, hotels and cars on a journey, as suggested by Inbox shortly after the announcement of the competition.  More difficult - the correspondence on the project.  For example, the worker, when the service itself brings together contracts, layouts, documentation, etc.  Or personal - a trip to a concert, a birthday.  In this case, we go from the opposite - not the user is looking for files, but the service offers him a selection of suitable content on potentially interesting topics. <br><br> <a href="https://dribbble.com/shots/2144451-Mail-ru-Contest"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/079/c1d/ef1/079c1def1a8298dbda66bf9e7c87119a.png"></a> <br><br>  Travel processing was offered by <a href="https://dribbble.com/shots/2144451-Mail-ru-Contest">Artem Triple</a> , <a href="https://dribbble.com/shots/2184822-Mail-Ru-App">Eduard Baksheyev</a> and a <a href="https://dribbble.com/shots/2234399-Octomail">group of British students of summer intensives on UX / UI</a> .  And some of them provided for the possibility of manual twisting - you can manually attach the letters to the journey, if the system did not handle the situation. <br><br> <a href="https://dribbble.com/shots/2184822-Mail-Ru-App"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c7a/bea/2cb/c7abea2cbda55fe25b7e6be99c506dba.png" alt="Edward Baksheev: Tape"></a> <br><br>  And the students also suggested traveling actions - to share, make them available offline. <br><br> <a href="https://dribbble.com/shots/2234399-Octomail"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/998/f5a/bf0/998f5abf049616dd75bb198c91e87bdf.png" alt="Summer Intensive Students on UX / UI in British: Events"></a> <br><br><h4>  Chats and personal assistants </h4><br>  The idea of ‚Äã‚Äãpresenting mail in the form of a chat has been flying in the air for a long time, applications are launched regularly - for example, Hop or domestic Mailburn.  The interest is clear - messengers gather an unthinkable audience, intersect in many usage scenarios with the mail, and are generally perceived more easily and casually.  <a href="https://dribbble.com/shots/2132974-Mail-app-for-Mail-ru">Danial Siddiqi</a> , <a href="https://dribbble.com/shots/2180543-Mail-concept">Yegor Kuznetsov</a> , <a href="https://dribbble.com/shots/2234399-Octomail">students of the British</a> and <a href="https://dribbble.com/shots/2197233-Project-Mail">Lunart</a> went among the participants in this direction.  Although this direction has a number of problems: not all of the letters manage to cut quotes, formatting is lost, and how to present the incoming list correctly?  Therefore, large services and not particularly strive in this direction. <br><br> <a href="https://dribbble.com/shots/2132974-Mail-app-for-Mail-ru"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e85/699/2ed/e856992ed3d19a04fb8ca96b5264ee89.png" alt="Daniyal Siddiqi: Chat"></a> <br><br>  <a href="https://dribbble.com/shots/2120421-Human-Computer-Conversation">Farid Rafikov</a> used the chat interface in a different format - he offered rather a helper, which allows you to find useful information among attachments.  The function is called "secretary" and suggests how to build a search query in natural language - it turned out quite interesting.  <a href="https://medium.com/%40formazon/human-computer-conversation-7c03703325ac">Farid told</a> about the principles of work <a href="https://medium.com/%40formazon/human-computer-conversation-7c03703325ac">in the article on Medium</a> . <br><br> <a href="https://dribbble.com/shots/2120421-Human-Computer-Conversation"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/74f/cc9/c1f/74fcc9c1f1b66de59c02e16df6f47750.png" alt="Farid Rafikov: Personal Assistant"></a> <br><br><h4>  Search and filtering </h4><br>  Almost all the participants thought about how the navigation through the attachment archive will work.  The possibilities of searching, filtering, sorting, and different list views are a necessary part of the task.  We consider them as a complex function, so let's go through the individual ideas: <br><br>  A very interesting idea is shown in the concept of <a href="https://dribbble.com/shots/2256596-Mail-ru-Competition">Daniel Bakalin</a> - contextual search using a floating button that can be dragged to any element on the screen and get results on it.  In the shown form, the function is not particularly obvious, but the idea itself is excellent, it can be refined and turned into an excellent working tool.  It is a pity that the author did not work on the visual component. <br><br> <a href="https://dribbble.com/shots/2256596-Mail-ru-Competition"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/1a6/08f/511/1a608f51174c491e756343fda9aa98b7.png" alt="Daniil Bakalin: Context Search" width="780" height="486"></a> <br><br>  <a href="https://dribbble.com/shots/2091722-Mail-Files">Ilya Sidorenko</a> suggests grouping search results. <br><br>  The many states of <a href="https://dribbble.com/shots/2117484--Mail-Ru-Dribbble-Competition">Nikita Filippov are</a> well described.

And in the form of a stack, if there are several.

I liked the display of the count of each type of files from a particular sender per day / week.  There is no possibility to view files in the context of letters. </blockquote><br><blockquote>  <strong>Slava Yashkov</strong> : The designer chose the right direction, but unfortunately he stopped halfway, or did not show all his ideas.  Looking for an attachment by sender is the first thing that comes to mind, but if you don‚Äôt remember it, then you have no chance in this concept. </blockquote><br><h4>  iOS9 and iPhone 6s </h4><br>  In early September, the final version of iOS9 and the phones on it were shown.  Interestingly, some of the participants suggested ideas similar to the announcement. <br><br>  <a href="https://dribbble.com/shots/2107459-Redesign-mail-app-for-Mail-ru">Vasily Potetyurin</a> took into account force touch in the iPhone 6s and suggested several gestures with its use. <br><br> <a href="https://dribbble.com/shots/2107459-Redesign-mail-app-for-Mail-ru"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/aaf/2ea/325/aaf2ea325a9927908e7b97fe7610a8c8.png" alt="Vasily Potetyurin: Force Touch"></a> <br><br>  The most excellent idea is shown by <a href="https://dribbble.com/shots/2224608-Mail-Ru-concept-email-app">Yuri Kostenko</a> - if you make a swipe on an attachment from the left edge, the associated letter will be shown.  Almost 3D touch with a card in a pop-up.  Even closer to this solution is Danial Siddiqi‚Äôs above-mentioned approach with a map in a letter. <br><br> <a href="https://dribbble.com/shots/2224608-Mail-Ru-concept-email-app"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/527/94b/a74/52794ba743d4204c1c2f3c64d9ff3459.jpg" alt="Yury Kostenko: Attachment and Letter"></a> <br><br>  The concept of Yuri as a whole is unusual.  In it, you can make pinch to zoom for quick viewing of a letter from the list, and swipe left and right a bit like Tinder - this also resembles solutions with 3D touch. <br><br> <a href="https://dribbble.com/shots/2224608-Mail-Ru-concept-email-app"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/1a1/3a5/f45/1a13a5f45b28eb0ca0b2ceccad1c1152.jpg" alt="Yuri Kostenko: Tinder-like actions"></a> <br><br>  Well, the very presentation of the letters in the tab style of mobile Safari only adds to the memorability of the idea. <br><br> <a href="https://dribbble.com/shots/2224608-Mail-Ru-concept-email-app"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/856/2ea/be6/8562eabe6942d66987db2a05e28356ee.jpg" alt="Yuri Kostenko: Safari-like view"></a> <br><br><h3>  Spectacular feed </h3><br>  Not everyone, unfortunately, showed an information map of the application, and without this it can be difficult to understand the idea.  It's great that there were interactive prototypes in InVision and Marvel - this allowed us to touch the interface visually.  Some work frankly failing in terms of the visual.  But in general, the level is quite good, and some concepts are especially pleasant in terms of submission: <br><br>  <a href="https://dribbble.com/shots/2175138-Concept-for-Mail-ru-competition">Ilyas Aliyev</a> : Powerful video and the presentation itself. <br><br><iframe src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://player.vimeo.com/video/134639489&amp;xid=17259,15700021,15700186,15700190,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhh1jjUtWkCC10h05p0mc0_lV6j-TA" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" title="Concept for Mail.ru competition" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  <a href="https://dribbble.com/shots/2194255-Mail-ru-Mobile-App-Concept">Ksenia Butyrina</a> : Excellent presentation.  It is a pity that I didn‚Äôt quite get into the task - in terms of the quality of performance, this is a clear candidate for victory. <br><br>  <a href="https://dribbble.com/shots/2195789-Mail-ru-Competition">Shakuro</a> : Good design, well-described presentation. <br><br> <a href="https://dribbble.com/shots/2195789-Mail-ru-Competition"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a4d/9c6/d2a/a4d9c6d2a0b4c343bfcd2bd7b5f785aa.gif"></a> <br><br>  <a href="https://dribbble.com/shots/2172320-Mail-ru-competition-mail-app-concept">Valery Sirotkin</a> : Although this neural network looks discouraging, in fact it turned out a good grouping of information.  The screen of the letter is well read in this style, the search screen is also well structured. <br><br>  <a href="https://dribbble.com/shots/2197590-mail-ru-concept">Marrying &amp; Artem</a> : <br><br> <a href="https://dribbble.com/shots/2197590-mail-ru-concept"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/88e/0c3/b00/88e0c3b00970a5d1e28d9e4a697e09a8.gif"></a> <br><br><blockquote>  <strong>Kostya Zubanov</strong> : An interesting choice of visual style, very cool.  But the grid would be nice to modify, not enough "geometrical" </blockquote><br><blockquote>  <strong>Slava Yashkov</strong> : This work shows what the mail would look like if the guys from VSCOcam did the design.  Simple shapes of icons, minimal set of styles and colors for the font - I love that.  Less is more.  True, in this style accuracy is required, here it is not observed, for example, there is clearly no grid of indents. </blockquote><br>  <a href="https://dribbble.com/shots/2197576-Mailutilus-App-Profile-Search-for-Mail-Ru-Contest">Ivan Mosievsky</a> : I received the audience award in the jury for the perpendicular approach. <br><br> <a href="https://dribbble.com/shots/2197576-Mailutilus-App-Profile-Search-for-Mail-Ru-Contest"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/39a/14a/7f5/39a14a7f554ce1975fc20f02f56237c5.gif"></a> <br><br>  <a href="https://dribbble.com/shots/2197142-Mail-Ru-Dribbble-Competition">Yevgeny Zagumenny</a> : We did not fully understand whether it is subtle trolling, but the style is respected to the smallest detail. <br><br> <a href="https://dribbble.com/shots/2197142-Mail-Ru-Dribbble-Competition"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/dbb/b0b/0db/dbbb0b0db67814e533caeeecec193953.png"></a> <br><br>  <a href="https://dribbble.com/shots/2234399-Octomail">Octomail</a> : This work from British students did not participate in the contest, but the character juggling with attachments pleased us pleasantly. <br><br> <a href="https://dribbble.com/shots/2234399-Octomail"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/79a/d6d/831/79ad6d831d2c57f7c2339914badbf6f8.jpg"></a> <br><br><h3>  Not everyone got into the task </h3><br>  Some designers too literally read the assignment, so, in essence, they did a redesign of the main Mail application.  Although from here, too, you can learn some ideas, in general, they passed the competition.  Perhaps the reason for this is the competition announcements on third-party resources, some of which also literally read the task.  It is a pity, because the concept of <a href="https://dribbble.com/shots/2181528-Mail-Ru-Dribbble-Competition">Amala Alili</a> turned out to be pleasant and neat. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/U3HG6lIjlVM%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700021,15700186,15700190,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhiQ-0fXgaWhZMN3QoFnD01r_6ljpw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  Many participants did not go far and reproduced the list of letters from the Google Inbox application.  Someone is quite meticulous, someone with their own variations.  This is really one of the three parts of the integrated solution (highlighting attachments right in the list of letters), but it is unlikely that a competition was needed.  Enumerate them, probably will not. <br><br><blockquote>  <strong>Artem Triple</strong> : It is a pity that some designers did not try to come up with something completely new, but only added categories for sorting.  This is not a test job when applying for a job.  In such competitions there is an opportunity to come up with something completely unique, and not something that will be implemented after the competition. </blockquote><br><h2>  Winners </h2><br>  We carefully walked through the list of ideas described above.  Having driven them through the set of criteria described above, we received three of the most suitable works: <br><br><h4>  1st place: <a href="https://dribbble.com/shots/2195789-Mail-ru-Competition">Shakuro</a> </h4><br>  The guys best hit the task.  This is a separate application, well thought out in terms of interface and great filed in terms of visual design.  The decision is accompanied by an intelligent description and animation of the product.  In addition to all this, in the concept is a bundle of individual ideas that do not overlap with other works - for example, archive of files by date on the calendar grid, sharinga panel, access PIN code. <br><br> <a href="https://dribbble.com/shots/2195789-Mail-ru-Competition"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/58d/665/89b/58d66589b354e30cec3258b51c368617.png" alt="Shakuro"></a> <br><br><blockquote>  <strong>Kostya Zubanov</strong> : This work is a good example of solving the set task.  Recent files in the context of correspondence, an interesting idea with a calendar and a good feed.  I didn‚Äôt like the emphasis on text search by attachments and the principle of distribution of documents among smart folders is incomprehensible. </blockquote><br><blockquote>  <strong>Slava Yashkov</strong> : It is evident that the guys were confused and looked on behalf of the people who will use it.  Basic cases for finding attachments are present.     . . </blockquote><br><h4> 2 : <a href="https://dribbble.com/shots/2120421-Human-Computer-Conversation"> </a> </h4><br><br>     ,        .
