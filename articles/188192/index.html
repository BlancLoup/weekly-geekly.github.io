Today, at <a href="http://brainstorage.me/%3Futm_source%3Dhabrapost%26utm_medium%3Dlink%26utm_campaign%3D29july">Brainstorage.me,</a> instead of HTTP authorization, a friendly registration form has begun to open - welcome to the beta test! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/80b/0cd/5d4/80b0cd5d45016bf8775c9e178371d93d.png"><br><br>  Some details under the cut. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  We realized the need to create this project almost immediately after the launch of <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/tm/blog/157045/">Freelansim</a> .  Many users asked to add portfolios and reviews - useful functions, but we decided to make them separately, so as not to clutter a minimalistic service.

      What is Brainstorage at the moment?  This is a professional network of people employed in the IT industry.  The service is designed to help professionals accumulate information about the acquired experience in one place (education, work experience, portfolio, professional skills, recommendations) and present it in a convenient way to friends, colleagues and all those interested in potential cooperation. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#3498db">Single profile</font> </h2><br>  Like most resources, Brainstorage starts with registration.  Further, so that your profile is not impersonal, we advise you to fill in information about yourself - who you are, where you studied and worked, as well as any other relevant, in your opinion, information.  All this will help you find a job in the future, if you are suddenly looking for it - we will roll out the HR functionality later. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/cca/7a6/205/cca7a6205073d784be69dde1a1ef81a9.png"><br><br><h2>  <font color="#3498db">Portfolio</font> </h2><br>  Someone will ask: why do I need another portfolio site?  And it will be right - "one more sites" is really a lot.  But the ‚ÄúBrain store‚Äù is another task - to combine in one place all your information scattered throughout the network.  To result in a kind of "single profile", which is easy to keep up to date. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/a19/66b/1e7/a1966b1e73214ed55fab2e4e42133220.png"><br><br>  The site is a set of pre-installed and arbitrary widgets - build your profile as a designer.  Already, you can add as many sections as you like (logos, website design, corporate identity, icons, and so on), and then add your work to each of them - each work individually or as part of a project.  For example, you have done for someone a whole complex of works - all this can be put in one handful. <br><br>  In order to take care of your time, we have made it possible to import portfolios with <a href="http://www.behance.net/">Behance</a> , <a href="http://dribbble.com/">Dribbble,</a> and even the beloved Free-Lance.ru.  That's right - now there is no need to spend $ 20 per month for a visual portfolio;) Despite the experimental nature of these functions, we will try to add new resources. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/704/a4d/47e/704a4d47ed710d26b4613e45c167b812.png"><br><br>  But some designers do not end up with creative people - there are, after all, still copywriters, programmers, web designers, and everything.  Including for this reason, we made support for text work (articles) with a convenient WYSIWYG editor, as well as GitHub repositories, so that your colleagues and potential employers would not have to search for yours <s>without</s> source throughout the network.  For the authors of "Habrahabra" there is a separate widget, and integration with the services of "Freelance" and "Huntim" should be expected in the very near future. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/e5f/b00/39a/e5fb0039a6af4cd1f2bcf6ae2bf4a5b6.png"><br><br>  In the ‚ÄúPortfolio‚Äù section there is almost complete freedom of action, but as you already understood, this is only part of the project. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#3498db">Reviews and recommendations</font> </h2><br>  We decided to abandon the word ‚ÄúReview‚Äù in favor of the more professional term ‚ÄúRecommendation‚Äù.  Any user registered on the site can either write a new recommendation to another user (including with regard to his key skills), or confirm a previously left by someone. <br><br>  You can also evaluate the published work. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#3498db">Activity tape</font> </h2><br>  If any of your colleagues / fans had already been subscribed to you, they would see in your activity tape changes in your profile - works added to the portfolio, written recommendations, and so on.  You can do the same in the same way - find your friends or just interesting people, and then follow their activities in your feed. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/fcc/407/c09/fcc407c099c3c2a64afd4b2ff478a6c0.png"><br><br>  Agree, doing it on one site is much more convenient than on five different ones.  Publish in the comments to this post links to your profiles, look for colleagues through social networks - be aware of who does what and what, evaluate and discuss their work. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#3498db">Go-go-go!</font> </h2><br>  The project was quite functional, but at the same time very simple - you will understand it without any problems.  I am sure that Brainstorage will be a great place to establish new professional connections - it's time <a href="http://brainstorage.me/%3Futm_source%3Dhabrapost%26utm_medium%3Dlink%26utm_campaign%3D29july">to try it</a> ! <br><br>  <a href="http://brainstorage.me/feedback">Feedback form</a> is waiting for your bug reports, feedback and suggestions. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/c68/534/d33/c68534d33f3c91fbfdfaba2d4a666ee4.png">  <a href="http://brainstorage.me/Boomburum">Boomburum</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/188192/">https://habr.com/ru/post/188192/</a></p>
