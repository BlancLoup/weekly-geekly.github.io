Why it is needed, why it is good, and how it works - I want to tell in this article. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/06e/ec0/886/06eec0886c8b4e32af26e0a963aecb19.png" alt="image"><br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  So, what they write:

      <i>For a long time, one of the weak points of our freelance exchange was the lack of account verification - we ourselves understood this, you yourself asked for this more than once.</i>  <i>We are pleased to announce that now you can verify your profile on ‚ÄúFreelance‚Äù using the Yandex.Money payment system.</i>  <i>All you need is to link your account with your account on Yandex.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>After successful verification, the user's avatar is marked with a green icon, which can be seen in the user profile or on the order page (both at the customer and the contractor).</i>  <i>It can also be found on the profile avatar in the lists of <a href="http://freelansim.ru/freelancers">"Freelancers"</a> and <a href="http://freelansim.ru/services">"Services"</a> .</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>What does verification give?</i>  <i>A green checkmark in a user profile is another argument in favor of working with him.</i>  <i>But we must understand that the presence of this checkbox does not protect against possible troubles, so never forget to think.</i> <br><br><h2>  Why do you need it? </h2><br>  Remote work is a risky business, especially with our mentality (Indians also ‚Äúthrow‚Äù, but much less often).  A lot of ‚Äúrogues‚Äù graze on freelance - i.e.  Those who came to try, but not completing the task and not returning the prepayment will not be very upset.  There are professional fraudsters who are convincing enough, but again - just until the prepayment.  Then their persuasiveness disappears, and they themselves. <br><br>  What does the customer do in this case?  Writes in support, provides evidence.  Exchange deletes the fraudster account.  After that, "rogues" usually end their way.  Rare, especially persistent, try again.  But the scammers don't stop there.  We change the mobile number, mail, voice and IP - and rushed.  And so you can do <s>it until the brick on the head will not give</s> to infinity. <br><br>  How to be a customer who doesn‚Äôt have a lot of experience working with freelancers (or doesn‚Äôt know our mentality very well)? <br><br><h2>  Why is it good? </h2><br>  And here verification of the account comes to the rescue.  It is easy to notice its presence - on all exchanges where it is (at the moment <a href="http://freelansim.ru/">freelansim.ru</a> , <a href="http://fl.ru/">fl.ru</a> , <a href="http://freelancehunt.com/">freelancehunt.com</a> ) this is noted everywhere - on the account page, project responses, etc. <br><br>  What does the verification: <br><ol><li>  confirms that the user is a real person </li><li>  gives access to passport data for law enforcement </li></ol><br>  The fraudsters will certainly not verify the profile - if the principal customer gets caught and brings the case to court, you can fly into the money, and if it is confirmed that this is not an isolated case - and get the time limit (albeit conditional).  In addition, to register again even if it works out, then verification of the account with the same data will not work out for sure - check if the wallet has been used, the exchange is simple enough. <br><br>  Therefore, we can say with confidence that among the verified not more than 1% of fraudsters and not more than 20% of "rogues" (in the first digit I am sure, I take the second one by sight).  Those who verified their profile - certainly have serious intentions. <br><br>  Total: <br><ul><li>  it's easier for customers to choose an artist </li><li>  calmer for the prepayment </li><li>  if that - to find a freelancer is not difficult </li><li>  Somewhere for this and rating throw in </li></ul><br><h2>  How it works? </h2><br>  <a href="http://freelansim.ru/">freelansim.ru</a> decided to use <a href="https://money.yandex.ru/">Yandex.Money</a> .  This is correct - everyone has identified wallets, for verification you need to make a couple of clicks. <br><br>  The scheme is as follows - we indicate the wallet, we are being transferred to <a href="https://money.yandex.ru/">Yandex.Money</a> , then we confirm that our wallet is ours.  Done!  Simple and dust free. <br><br>  The exchange does not receive passport data or any other personal information.  Only wallet number.  If something happens, Yandex has this data, and he is obliged to provide this information at the request of law enforcement officers. <br><br>  As a result, the sheep are intact, the wolves are fed <s>and the shepherd‚Äôs bones are buried</s> .  The exchange receives confirmation of the user's reality without transferring personal information.  When you need to find the person who is behind the wallet - a trifling matter.  The customer is calm, not absolute, but still.  Freelancer - the argument that has the most serious intentions. <br><br><h2>  Objections </h2><br>  Pessimists.  " <i>We all die, everything can be faked</i> ." <br><br>  This is of course yes, everything in this world is bought and sold.  You can bribe an identification agent and provide unrealistic data.  You can bribe a bank employee, a prosecutor, a judge, but anyone.  But usually they do not do that, for this is an article, respectively, a term.  To fraudsters and ‚Äúrogues‚Äù this is too tough - neither morally nor financially. <br><br>  Realists.  " <i>You can bind someone else's wallet</i> " <br><br>  This is of course yes, but how many people will give access to the wallet?  They will give only their own - relatives, friends - but will they be substituted by a cheater?  As a last resort, Yandex and Freelansim can provide account data, and comparing them, we can conclude that the wallet was used once to confirm the profile or was used constantly. <br><br>  Paranoid.  ‚Äú <i>FSB and CIA will find me</i> ‚Äù <br><br>  First, if you want (FSB and CIA), and in the den, and in the desert will find.  But the main thing is that during verification no personal information is transmitted!  Generally no.  And Yandex already has it - there we provide it completely voluntarily.  In the end, for all our lives, copies (!) Of passports fall into dozens of hands (certificates, credits, receipts, domains, etc.).  In general, having verified your profile, you can sleep well. <br><br><hr><br>  Total - account verification is a good thing, you should not be biased towards it.  If you are not a "rogue" and not a crook, there is nothing to fear.  On the contrary - it is obvious that when choosing an artist, the customer will prefer a freelancer with a verified account.  But if you are a customer, remember that verified people are also people, ‚Äúthe <i>presence of this tick does not protect against possible troubles, so never forget to think</i> .‚Äù <br><br>  Thinking is our everything! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/290536/">https://habr.com/ru/post/290536/</a></p>
