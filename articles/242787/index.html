COAXIAL?  ZeeVee relies on technology that is difficult to criticize.  Their series of signal transmission devices for AV, TV and digitalsignage systems make it obvious that using existing technology will in most cases be an easy and effective solution with better payback. <br>  On the one hand, surprise is understandable.  On the other hand, ZeeVee is the number one coaxial solution provider in the United States and is the only certified supplier of DirectTV and Dish, the American equivalent of Sky, Bt and Virgin.  And this is a good argument for the company.

      Initially, ZeeVee has two series of solutions for transmitting HD signals: the ZvPro series, for use with small systems (one or two channels) and HDBridge for use with a large number of channels. <br><br>  The company developed, providing solutions for the transmission of TV signal and with the advent of new technologies, took up developing digital signage systems.  With a coaxial cable bandwidth of more than 5 GB, the company's solutions were ideally suited to the requirements of HD digitalsignage systems.  With devices for signal transmission and the presence of coaxial cable in most buildings, the company rapidly gained momentum, and with them growth and recognition.  Now ZeeVee has come to Europe, and in October last year, an office was opened in the UK.  But before these, the company spent 12 months in order to make sure that their devices work perfectly with all European standards.  All ZeeVee products are based on their own microchip, which provides many possibilities for solving a wide range of tasks.  At the same time, devices are always ready for any requirements of tomorrow, even non-standard ones. <br><br>  It is worth mentioning that the company is a partner of NEC and the company's solutions perfectly showed themselves at the NECShowcase exhibition in May of this year.  The devices were used to transmit the signal from Scala's broadcast cameras and media players to screens and video walls around the exhibition hall. <br><br>  <b>The benefit of using coaxial cable.</b> <br>  So, why is coax cable?  ZeeVee devices simulate a signal through an existing or new network consisting of coaxial cables.  And according to the company, such a decision has a greater benefit, compared with alternative solutions for signal transmission. <br><br>  Coaxial cable can already be placed in the building and in this case it is possible, using just one player and an encoder / modulator, to transmit a signal to an infinite number of TV screens and / or displays for an infinite distance. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/3a3/d68/77f/3a3d6877f02d86c4d4217fe2f9581d80.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Solutions are integrated quite easily, since the modulators are placed in close proximity to the source of the signal and all content is transmitted over a single coaxial cable.  There is no need for direct laying, transmitters, switches and receivers.  The cable structure includes chamomile and star twist, or any combination to provide signal transmission over distances far exceeding 100 meters, which is a limitation when transmitting over IP.  It is important to pay attention to the fact that the coaxial cable can be connected directly to the TV, and this, in turn, eliminates the known risks inherent in the CatX standard.  Thus, the transmission of a signal over a coaxial cable, according to the company, has almost no limits on distance. <br><br>  The coaxial network also allows you to keep the player, and in this case just one player, on the desktop, or in any other place where there is a coaxial connection for quick access and easy control, without forgetting about its safety.  And there is no longer any need to keep the ‚Äúbox‚Äù behind each of the screens, all you need is a direct connection from the player to the modulator and then to the screen. <br><br>  This technology has long proved its convenience and versatility.  With a bandwidth far superior to Cat5 / 6, it has been the main pillar of cable and satellite companies for many years.  Moreover, additional channels and / or screens can be easily added without disrupting the work, creating unnecessary infrastructures and equipment and labor costs.  Just imagine, hotels, stadiums, bars and restaurants can easily add an information or advertising channel to an existing network and hundreds and thousands of visitors will immediately see this information. <br><br>  ZeeVee solution is high frequency.  If you need to send 100 unique messages simultaneously to 100 screens, you must use 25 (x4 channels) devices in one place.  Coaxial cable is connected directly to the TV and does not require additional equipment.  A real example of simplicity! <br><br>  ZeeVee's high-frequency modulator makes any AV source a TV channel, the signal from which is subsequently transmitted.  The screen can be a regular consumer TV with a built-in digital tuner.  For displays and projectors without a built-in tuner, ZeeVee suggests using an external ZvSync tuner. <br><br>  On the screen tuned to the channel, the signal from the source through the modulator will be played.  Thus, all that is necessary for a modulator to transmit a signal from a source is an idle channel. <br><br>  <b>Attracting surprised looks.</b> <br>  Digital signage is always brightness and attractiveness in the presentation of a brand, product or opportunity.  And all that is needed to arouse the interest of visitors is the crystal clear HD image.  ZeeVee's solution has every opportunity to present your message in the best possible way.  The company's devices can rightly boast superb image quality.  In addition to easy setup, the devices are compatible with both analog and digital signal sources, supporting both standard and HD resolutions. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/907/d8c/434/907d8c434c5556ae8c5f13237cdb9b91.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Devices from ZeeVee can also find other useful applications, such as, for example, alarm notification.  When in certain situations, for example in case of fire, a message about evacuation from a building is transmitted through all the network channels. <br><br>  <b>Advantages of the new player.</b> <br>  Although there is a tendency to fix media players on the back of displays, ZeeVee considers this solution inconvenient and expensive.  It is not necessary that content used on multiple screens be stored in several places at once.  Expanding the system is too expensive, since adding a display means that you need to add both a player and cables.  Do not forget about the limitations on the distance of 100 meters for IP solutions and adding a power source for the player. <br><br>  For example, in order to inform employees, an enterprise decided to create a digital signage system consisting of 20 screens.  The main tasks are: the ability to effectively alert, low costs and easy maintenance.  And one more important detail is the future possibility of expanding this system. <br><br>  When using a solution with a player for each display, transmitting a unique message to your display is quite feasible.  But when several displays display one message, it means that there is no need for a separate player for each screen.  Be that as it may, in such a system the player should be for each display and as a result - bust with the equipment, which entails high costs. <br><br>  In case of using the solution from ZeeVee, transmission over coaxial cable is possible from players to any number of screens and to any distance.  Since the information of each player will be transmitted to a specific HDTV channel, screens configured for this channel will automatically display the signal from the player. <br><br>  In conclusion, we can say that digital signage systems created using ZeeVee coaxial solutions are the most economical and efficient.  This is a platform that allows you to transmit HD-signal from more than 100 channels to an infinite number of displays and any distance, using a convenient cable network.  Installation in a new or existing coaxial network is absolutely simple and there is always the possibility for further expansion of the network by adding channels and displays. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/242787/">https://habr.com/ru/post/242787/</a></p>
