  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Learn more about plugins and programs for Google Buzz, as well as Buzz marketing.</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  If twitter could be translated as ‚Äúpizdun‚Äù, then an analogue of the buzz in the Runet tradition would be ‚Äúsrach‚Äù (it is no coincidence that the translators decided not to suffer with ‚Äútalk‚Äù and ‚Äútalkers‚Äù and called the Live Ribbon service, curtsying towards LiveJournal, where , in fact, only one ‚Äúsrach in the comments‚Äù is happening).  The difference in names expresses differences in essence: less reflection, more sociality. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  Features of Google Buzz itself </h4><br>  In runet, everyone is comparing Google Google with Twitter.  In fact, Google Buzz has more in common with the well-known Friendfeed and Tumblr in Russia and unfamiliar Russian users Yelp and Foursquare. <br><br>  In addition to the lack of restrictions on the number of characters in <a href="http://friendfeed.com/">Buzz</a> , you can comment on the recordings, as in <a href="http://friendfeed.com/">Friendfeed</a> and insert pictures and videos, as in <a href="http://www.tumblr.com/">Tumblr</a> . <br><br>  In the states pay attention to the fact that "Buzz" automatically locates the user through the service Google Latitude, which allows you to immediately tell your friends about your location.  Plus, the Buzz site is optimized for Android and iPhone.  (A new tab is simply added to the usual Gmail design for users of these phones.) Google is not a pioneer here.

      Americans already have <a href="http://foursquare.com/">Foursquare</a> and <a href="http://www.yelp.com/">Yelp</a> services.  Foursquare itself notifies the user's friends about its location, and at the same time gives information about nearby places.  Yelp is generally geared towards searching, discussing and reviewing places and establishments. <br><br>  In Russia, there is a <a href="http://vstrecher.ru/">Sharpener</a> sharpened for cell <a href="http://vstrecher.ru/">phones</a> , but there is a bare card in it, you will not see any cafe or club nearby.  True, based on it, they made the <a href="http://topskidka.ru/">Top Discount</a> , with its help you can see the nearest store sales. <br><br>  Coming back to Google Buzz, this is a new PR and SMM tool with great potential. <br><br><h4>  Corporate Google Buzz </h4><br>  Those companies that have already registered their corporate email in Gmail are most fortunate.  Now, creating a post in Lenta, they can contact everyone with whom they corresponded. <br><br>  In order not to spam everyone in a row, of course, you should use the privacy settings and make notes that are available only for certain groups.  Corporate "Buzz" may include such groups as Employees, Customers, Partners, PR. <br><br>  Thus, Google Buzz will be able to replace several channels of information distribution at once: a corporate blog, an internal corporate newsletter and correspondence, a newsletter with press releases for reporters. <br><br>  However, whether "Buzz" will become a popular service for ordinary users is still in question.  At the time of the appearance, he bravely braked, was incomprehensible, and immediately scared off even the most favorably-minded Google evangelists. <br><br>  Obviously, plug-ins, programs and other trinkets will play a role in popularizing the product.  We have selected the most useful. <br><br><h4>  Nishtyak for Google Buzz </h4><br>  Most of the listed nishtyakov can be found on the <a href="http://buzzaware.com/">Buzzaware</a> website. <br><br>  A plugin for Firefox called <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/75917">Buzz it!</a>  allows you to ‚Äúforget‚Äù the address of the current page, accompanying it with comments.  You press a special button, and then in a new tab a new email window opens in Gmail.  The subject of the letter consists of the title and the address of the page, shortened with <a href="http://bit.ly/">bit.ly.</a>  You can edit the subject and add text to the message body, then click ‚Äúsend‚Äù, and the message will appear in the ribbon. <br><br>  For Chrome, there is <a href="https://chrome.google.com/extensions/detail/fmmaomnifgiheomcnmiginicjpkdngok">Chrome Buzz</a> : roughly the same as Echofon for Firefox.  While you can only view messages and comments to them, they soon promise the possibility of posting. <br><br>  <a href="http://buzzaware.com/gbd/">Google Buzz Desktop</a> , running on Adobe AIR, is dull to the obscene, and deserves to be mentioned simply as a fact - a desktop application for Buzz has appeared.  We hope that a worthy replacement will appear soon. <br><br>  What many people lacked was the ability to import recordings from ‚ÄúBuzz‚Äù to Twitter.  With <a href="http://www.buzzcantweet.com/">BuzzCanTwit,</a> you can import custom messages or even specific pieces of records.  <a href="http://tw2buzz.com/beta">Tw2buzz</a> imports to twitter friends from Twitter.  Since the project is in beta, you need to request an invite (this is done directly on the site). <br><br><h4>  SMO website optimization for Google Buzz </h4><br>  In addition to your own convenience, you should take care of visitors to your site who use Buzz.  For sites made on the Wordrpess platform, there are the following solutions. <br><br>  First of all, these are the ‚Äúbuzz this‚Äù buttons, with the help of which visitors of the site or blog can copy the article into their cozy ‚ÄúBuzz‚Äù. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/eba/b37/a94/ebab37a94fa53b3aed88859c3e376eab.jpg"><br>  <a href="http://www.clickonf5.org/google-buzz-button-wordpress">Google Buzz Button</a> is the easiest option with the least number of settings (the height and width of the button, the position relative to the content, the value of the rel attribute in the link). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c73/b46/c6a/c73b46c6ae43aa4a93627ca06ed058ad.jpg"><br>  <a href="http://arpitshah.com/plugins/wp-google-buzz/">WP Google Buzz</a> features many button design options. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/9dd/37c/b76/9dd37cb767796d30a0dd29f30ac8af4a.jpg"><br>  The <a href="http://hameedullah.com/wordpress/wpbuzzer">WPBuzzer</a> button looks similar to the Google Buzz Button, but it counts clicks using the Bit.ly API, as well as fine-tuning the location (you can choose where to display the button: in posts, in RSS feeds, on the main page and other pages) . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/9d5/57f/462/9d557f462a793ded533e147b06038811.jpg"><br>  Another option is the <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/light-social/">Light Social</a> social bookmark buttons that include Twitter, Buzz and other social services. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/072/1e3/0ca/0721e30caf31fa7109a05b3638b0a23c.jpg"><br>  <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/google-buzz-er/">Google Buzz ER</a> will add public posts from <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/google-buzz-er/">Buzz</a> (though no comments) to the sidebar of your blog. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/65e/2f6/44b/65e2f644bc5f93544bab1dfe76231251.jpg"><br>  The <a href="http://buzzcounter.net/">BuzzCounter.net</a> widget can be inserted into any blog, and it will show all entries along with comment counters. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d1f/c94/a83/d1fc94a835c42703ae850627add3234e.jpg"><br>  Finally, commenting will be <a href="http://intensedebate.com/">enabled by the IntenseDebate</a> commenting <a href="http://intensedebate.com/">system</a> . <br><br><h4>  Will Google Buzz be a marketing tool? </h4><br>  On the face of a situation where everyone diligently adjusts to the emergence of a new service, install buttons and plug-ins ‚Äúfor it to be‚Äù, but do not fully understand the real usefulness of the service for business. <br><br>  The possibility of private publishing, which is not on Twitter, allows you to solve several tasks at once in the same place, and importing contacts if you have a corporate Gmail mailbox allows you to immediately contact your audience. <br><br>  But will not the Buzz turn into a garbage dump three times faster than LiveJournal?  If you read, for example, the tape of Anton Nosik, who does not seem to bother with the separation of public and private messages, the desire to unsubscribe from his channel will arise very quickly. <br><br>  Wait and see.  In addition, Google is known for its leisurely tuning services.  Quite possibly, he sharpens the "Buzz" for specific goals, and in the end he will push the enlightened youth, and everyone will start a Buzz, as Gmail once did. <br><br>  <a href="http://stema.livejournal.com/">Original post</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/86350/">https://habr.com/ru/post/86350/</a></p>
