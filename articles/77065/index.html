  <section class="page js-page"><h1>48 cores to masses</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  <b>SANTA CLARA (California), December 2, 2009, 5:30 pm</b> - Intel researchers demonstrated a prototype 48-core processor called the ‚Äúsingle-chip computer for cloud computing‚Äù and allowing for revisions of the designs of desktops, laptops and servers of the future. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/3d6/efb/a1d/3d6efba1d5ba3d20df0f6543a41fb7ab.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The experimental processor assumes 10-20 times higher performance compared to modern models of the Intel Core family. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The researchers' long-term goal is to endow the computers being created with fantastic scaling capabilities that will provide a higher level of human interaction and work with as-yet-unknown applications.  In the coming year, Intel plans to introduce to developers over a hundred experimental microchips for testing and creating new applications and programming systems based on them.

      In early 2010, Intel intends to provide the updated Core processor family with new capabilities and begin production of 6- and 8-core processors.  For comparison: the presented prototype contains 48 independently programmable cores - the largest number ever placed on a single silicon chip.  In addition, the prototype is capable of high-speed data exchange, developed on the basis of the latest energy management technologies, thanks to which 48 cores consume up to 25 W in standby mode and 125 W at maximum performance (approximately the same amount of modern Intel processors, which only two times the consumption of a standard household incandescent lamp). <br><br>  Using the example of an experimental chip, Intel intends to study in detail the mechanisms for managing and coordinating the work of a large number of cores, which will further allow such solutions to be brought to the mass market.  Future laptops with the computing power of such a processor will be able to "perceive" the world around them the way a person does, and respond adequately to what is happening. <br>  Imagine that one day you will be able to take dance lessons from a computer or, using a 3D camera, walk around a clothing store and try on clothes. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/6ec/e71/c1a/6ece71c1a0cd600bea321395652d4eed.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The implementation of the new principles of the human-computer interface will allow working without a keyboard and other controls.  Experts believe that computers, in the end, will be able to read the user's thoughts - to do this, you just need to say the command to yourself. <br><br>  Intel developers called their offspring a ‚Äúsingle-chip‚Äú cloud ‚Äùcomputer, because it simulates a data processing center (DPC) for‚Äú cloudy ‚Äù(distributed) computing performed via the Internet and allowing banks, social networks and online stores to provide online services. <br>  ‚ÄúCloud‚Äù data centers can include from tens to hundreds of computers connected by a network, simultaneously processing a large number of complex tasks and operating with large amounts of data.  The experimental Intel chip uses a similar technology, however, computers and networks are located on it on a single chip, not larger than a postage stamp. <br><br>  <b>Kernels provide intelligent data management</b> <br><br>  For effective information exchange, the experimental chip is equipped with special internuclear links.  This solution allows to significantly increase the performance and efficiency of data exchange, due to their movement inside the processor case only by millimeters, and not by tens of meters between individual computers, as in modern data centers. <br>  A software application that supports such a chip will provide data exchange between the cores in a fraction of a second, achieving performance that cannot be achieved in systems with memory located outside the processor cases.  Applications can automatically control which of the cores should execute a particular command at one time or another.  Auxiliary tasks will be performed on other kernels.  Programs will be able to control processor power and clock speed, turn off or limit the speed of the cores, while ensuring a minimum of power consumption. <br><br>  <b>Overcoming barriers to programming</b> <br><br>  As you know, programming applications for multi-core processors is not an easy task.  The continuous development of multi-core systems complicates the situation.  The prototype developed by Intel allows to apply the approaches used in the development of software for the data center to parallel programming.  But soon they can be used in a single chip! <br>  In the course of collaboration, Intel, HP *, and Yahoo Open Cirrus * began to port cloud applications to a new 48-core chip with Intel architecture through Hadoop *, a Java-based system * that allows you to create applications for intensive data processing.  The corresponding demonstration was held by Intel chief technical officer Justin Rattner. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/202/c38/9ca/202c389ca8e075a808d5848cb438cd1f.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Intel plans to create more than a hundred experimental chips that will be available to dozens of companies and research centers.  These chips will allow specialists to develop new software and programming models that can be used to create applications for future multi-core chips.  For example, in Europe, the experimental chip plans to use the Institute of Technology in Zurich (Switzerland). <br><br>  The creation of an experimental multi-core processor was made possible thanks to the efforts of participants in the Intel Tera-scale Computing Research program, aimed at developing systems with a large number of cores.  The project is conducted by Intel Labs in Bangalore (India), Braunschweig (Germany), Hillsboro (Oregon, USA).  The Intel Center in Braunschweig, which is part of the Intel Labs Europe network, developed: a processor core, a special hardware platform that provides faster interaction of the cores, as well as an optimized energy-saving memory controller, designed specifically to work with multiple cores.  The German team responsible for testing the chipset created its own chip emulator, which allowed other centers to test software and hardware solutions based on the new chip prior to its release.  This approach has halved the project development time.  Details of the architecture and chip design will be announced in a report at the International Solid State Circuits Conference in February 2010. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/77065/">https://habr.com/ru/post/77065/</a></p>
