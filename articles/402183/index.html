This program is called Amazon Launchpad and is positioned by the company as "a unique program that helps show millions of Amazon users innovative start-up products like yours." <br><br>  The idea is quite interesting, because many companies are now creating great products that could be useful to tens of thousands of buyers.  But now not every startup has the opportunity to promote its product.  And in order to help a young company sell its product, Amazon provides its own platform.  At Madrobots, we follow Launchpad updates to understand the dynamics of the smart device market, some of the presented devices are sold in <a href="http://madrobots.ru/%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes.ru%26utm_medium%3Dpr%26utm_campaign%3Damazon">our store</a> .  Let's see what is now popular in the gadgets section. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h3>  Radio Tile Slim </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/51d/50a/a8a/51d50aa8a86b57cff2e54bc45ca1d6fe.jpg" width="850">

      Small things are often lost, and not only in a taxi or cafe, but at home.  In this case, they can be detected relatively quickly.  But if such a thing (wallet, keys) is lost in a public place, it will be extremely difficult or impossible to find it. <br><br>  In such cases, you can use search tags.  One of the most popular on Amazon Launchpad is the Tile Slim label.  This miniature device with a thin body, the thickness of which does not exceed two credit cards folded together.  If in figures, then its thickness is only 2 mm.  Size - 5 * 5 centimeters. <br><br>  Due to its size, the label can be put in a bag, purse, pocket or attached to the keys.  It can also be attached to any device or item of the appropriate size.  The label is perceived by others as part of the design of the device, so that it does not catch the eye.  In its center - a button to search for things. <br><br>  With RFID comes an application for your phone (Android, iOS).  It shows the signal from the mark in the event that it is within a radius of 30 meters.  You can configure the system so that the application will give a signal if you move a certain distance from the same wallet (forget it in the cafe). <br><br>  All data is transmitted via Bluetooth LTE.  The built-in battery tag lasts for 1 year of work, after which it can be changed to a new one in the reTile program. <br><br>  Tile Slim is available for pre-order in <a href="http://madrobots.ru/p/tile-slim/%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes.ru%26utm_medium%3Dpr%26utm_campaign%3Damazon">our catalog</a> . <br><br><h3>  Droid Sphero BB-8 Droid </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/5b5/3ad/05f/5b53ad05f7590e42dd286c20c6198905.jpg" width="850"><br><br>  This toy robot is a smaller copy of the droid from the seventh episode of "Star Wars".  The developers positioned this system as a toy for fans of the Star Wars universe, but the robot turned out so successful that ordinary users, who are not film fans at all, began to buy it. <br><br>  BB-8 is able to independently study the terrain on which it rolls, to avoid obstacles, to memorize the objects that stand out, and to follow the specific route that the owner has laid.  If you wish, you can set the patrol mode, and the droid will explore all corners of the apartment or office. <br><br>  The robot is equipped with a memory where you can download, for example, a video message by sending it to the addressee.  To perform this function, as well as all the others, you need to use the application on your smartphone or tablet.  The robot is not afraid of water, it can be rolled on a wet surface. <br><br>  It will work offline for an hour.  Charging of the robot takes place at the docking station, wires are not needed for this.  The basis of the mechanics of the movement of the droid is the principle of the gyro precession (or gyroscopic thrust).  Communication with mobile devices BB-8 supports Bluetooth Smart protocol, thanks to which it can be removed from the user at a distance of up to 30 meters. <br><br>  The robot listens to voice commands, and with the help of the phone, you can use augmented reality.  In it, the robot projects various images onto any surface - this is exactly what he did in the film. <br><br>  <b>Specifications</b> <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ Body: polycarbonate <br>  ‚Ä¢ Maximum speed: 6.4 km / h (2 m / s) <br>  ‚Ä¢ Communication: Bluetooth Smart (30 meters range) <br>  ‚Ä¢ Charging: Induction (1 hour of play with full charge) <br>  ‚Ä¢ Free app: BB -8 App- Enabled Droid (available on iTunes or Google Play) <br>  ‚Ä¢ Internal control system: gyroscope and accelerometer <br>  ‚Ä¢ Dimensions: 11.4 x 7.3 cm <br>  ‚Ä¢ Weight: ~ 200 g <br><br>  This miracle of equipment is sold <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0107H5FJ6/ref%3Dzg_bs_12034490011_2%3Fie%3DUTF8%26psc%3D1%26refRID%3DVWB30A608GHX4QCDGJ03">on Amazon</a> , you can buy Sphero BB-8 <a href="http://madrobots.ru/p/star-wars-bb-8-droid/%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes.ru%26utm_medium%3Dpr%26utm_campaign%3Damazon">in Russia</a> . <br><br><h3>  Hickies - plastic replacement laces </h3><br><img src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/o-ChqsGDySM/maxresdefault.jpg" width="850"><br><br>  Ordinary shoelaces are not always comfortable and, at times, are untied at the most inappropriate moment for this. <br><br>  The authors of the Hickies project decided to create a replacement for laces and succeeded in this.  By launching a Hickies fundraising campaign on Kickstarter in 2013, they were able to raise $ 160,000 for development in the United States, which is six times more than required. <br><br>  The Hickies themselves are rubberized rivets that don't need to be tied and untied.  You can use them with any type of shoe with laces.  True, we advise you to choose the color scheme in advance so that the replacement of the laces does not stand out too much on the background of the shoes. <br><br>  Buy Hickies in different configurations and colors can be <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01G1LHC0C/ref%3Dzg_bs_12034490011_4%3Fie%3DUTF8%26psc%3D1%26refRID%3DVWB30A608GHX4QCDGJ03">on Amazon</a> . <br><br><h3>  Posture Corrector Lumo Lift </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/18d/45d/394/18d45d394188c9c212a88f5e70ec6410.jpg" width="850"><br>  Correct posture - the dream of almost every resident of the metropolis.  Having grown accustomed to slouch from childhood, already an adult simply does not know how it is - to walk smoothly, with a straight back.  In order to correct your posture, you can consult a doctor, or you can use a smart Lumo Lift device. <br><br>  It tracks, for example, walking, running, movement, and serves as a personal adviser on the difficult issue of correcting posture. <br><br>  Lumo Lift can also be used as a fitness tracker, controlling the burning of calories, the number of steps taken per day and the amount of time the user spent with his back straightened.  There is also a bad posture signaling device.  If a person starts to slouch, Lumo Lift reports this. <br><br>  All data is transferred to the mobile application on the phone or tablet, where it is stored.  The gadget is made in the form of a rectangular button size of 25.5 mm in width and 46 mm in length.
