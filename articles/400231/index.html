This year's latest gadget review, you can still have time to buy this piece for someone as a gift! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/87a/12f/790/87a12f790d0b49a582a5e4f7a4bc7ab7.jpg"><br><br>  What is a 3D pen?  It's almost like a 3D printer, just as a drive is your hand.  Personally, I came across such a thing for the first time, its limits of applicability were vague for me, so I discovered it for myself, although I planned to use it as a gift to children. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Box number one: 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"

    <img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f7e/f22/ea5/f7ef22ea5efa4ecbb8c3d3bfdd43f395.jpg"><br><br>  In the box the number of times - pen, power supply, three skeins of ABS plastic and instructions. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/7c8/532/b9b/7c8532b9b92043c49423112e0113a795.jpg"><br><br>  Box number two: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/dcc/45b/61f/dcc45b61f4a2406eabb6fa57b22ec79d.jpg"><br><br>  It has a whole palette of plastic wire: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/52b/15f/9ca/52b15f9ca1f3459db831c3ca9728bdf8.jpg"><br><br>  Do not even hope to get off the box number one time - it will not be a complete gift.  The consumables that come with the ‚Äúfamiliarization‚Äù pen are few, only three ABS hanks.  ABS plastic is convenient for familiarizing with the process of 3D drawing.  It is plastic, but it smells a little.  But it's not scary.  Those in the "palette" go much better, and the colors are diverse.  Calculate your strength - a bag of Santa Claus, of course, is dimensionless, but your wallet ... <br><br>  So, a 3D pen. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f43/0b2/9b7/f430b29b7c224e15a8a6b3acebe83a32.jpg"><br><br>  The slider, which you see on the first photo, controls the flow of plastic.  The handle puts the plastic thicker or thinner.  From here this nose puts: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/299/bc6/1d2/299bc61d25254933ba8b563fc0098c0c.jpg"><br><br>  A wire and a 12 volt power supply are plugged into the back of it. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/3fb/119/c53/3fb119c532a04f1bb19e71793779cf2e.jpg"><br><br>  And on top of the temperature indicator with buttons fine its adjustment for different grades of plastic. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ad6/4e3/53a/ad64e353a28d4ba49ccccafc80f1d09a.jpg"><br><br>  Here, for example, 215 degrees: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/081/017/373/0810173738f74dcfaf7f6b2a07c65d8b.jpg"><br><br>  Do not hold your fingers on the nozzle!  To draw with ABS plastic on the handle, you need to set the temperature to the ‚ÄúABS‚Äù position.  To the left of the pen are two keys.  (The handle is obviously "sharpened" under the right-handed).  The bottom one is wire feed, that is, the actual ‚Äúdrawing‚Äù, the top one is the reverse, which is necessary to remove the wire. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/878/1d0/bfa/8781d0bfa027484d9751d15f3fbf485d.jpg"><br><br>  The lower one works according to the principle: ‚ÄúClick-draw, not pressed ‚Äî do not draw‚Äù, the upper one spits out the wire completely and completely after a single press.  For example, to change the color.  Inside the handle is not very difficult.  In the back there is a feeding motor: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/fb2/90e/402/fb290e402cd54a3e8fc9cc7dce65ade6.jpg"><br><br>  In the front - a heating head with a nozzle: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/7b8/e8d/d07/7b8e8dd07d5d46aaa9e75db2c2493e49.jpg"><br><br>  A motor pushes the plastic wire to the head, it melts it and squeezes it out of the nozzle.  A bit like a glue gun. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ce2/456/d21/ce2456d21c704316b85f2b83aecd0520.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/bc2/4ff/0c3/bc24ff0c3c434db7b27298191a41da13.jpg"><br><br>  The muzzle is painted with plastic Watson.  If you look closely, you can see that the plastic is transparent.  Drawing in volume, despite the name, is quite difficult.  Plastic does not solidify quickly enough to make hanging elements (perhaps I just could not adjust the temperature correctly), so that the volumetric figures must either be assembled from flat parts, or use some kind of basis.  Perhaps more experienced users somehow contrive, but we have not yet mastered it.  (They say that balls made of cotton are used for ball-shaped toys, putting plastic in rows on top, but I did not try it, I didn‚Äôt have cotton at hand).  So my first 3D construct was made up of flat parts. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/8cd/faa/7e9/8cdfaa7e9282470aa70cd432f20788a5.jpg"><br><br>  The house is also "made" with the help of plastic from the Palette-Watson.  By the way, just about such a house (plus a couple of small experiments) is just enough one skein of plastic in the palette - the red we spent with the children at once.  So be prepared - consumables fly away, we halved them in a couple of days. <br><br>  Drawn house on one of the templates attached to the plastics palette: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/471/094/2d7/4710942d7bf24b85b0a0863ab8fd0d69.jpg"><br><br>  They are printed on parchment paper, and this is ideal for plastic - it clings to it, but is easily peeled off after cooling.  On very slippery surfaces, plastic stretches behind the handle, and on plain paper it sticks permanently.  And then on the template - take it and draw. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d54/f60/a60/d54f60a60ba94f17aa83846115e30f9e.jpg"><br><br>  In addition, in the palette in the center there is a plastic tube that plays the role of an axis for the coils, and the handle itself can be stored in it: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/228/616/8e0/2286168e04b84b98bd1d2ecbf6a39ecb.jpg"><br><br>  The palette is generally a handy thing, the wire is not stabbed behind the handle, it is smoothly wound off the coils ... Until it gets stuck, confused. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/0ea/2b2/0c7/0ea2b20c77af482192e90af10f7f29ea.jpg"><br><br>  For some reason, I got stuck white all the time, probably it was wound unevenly.  What is this pen good for?  In my opinion, only as a toy for children.  I have Junior (5 years) and Medium (13 years) - both were delighted. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/8e6/38a/419/8e638a419d554c808ead6f106bfc9ac1.jpg"><br><br>  But for a five-year-old, it‚Äôs still a bit early;  But the Average immediately made rose-colored glasses so that the world around seemed not so dull: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/75b/714/c97/75b714c977c2465dadaa607e34757d0d.jpg"><br><br>  Video <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/TbuyK0EG93w" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  Nothing practical to make such a pen will not work, so if you are looking for an alternative to a 3D printer, this is not about it.  But as a fun tool for children's educational creativity - an excellent thing.  You can make snowflakes and butterflies for the Christmas tree, even if it is clumsy, but with your own hands. <br><br>  About PLA Plastics <br><br>  The colors of PLA plastic are very bright.  It is very convenient to draw with such plastic both horizontal and volumetric figures.  Vertical "sticks" quickly harden and allow you to create a "volume".  Plastic is plastic and does not smell. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/bda/0d2/504/bda0d25044404d6a9e701cb53a0a8907.jpg"><br><br>  And what are the names!  Emerald City, Blueberry Jam :))) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/dd5/7bb/882/dd57bb8820954a2289bfbeb7e19a993e.jpg"><br><br>  And in the middle, by the way, is a hole, and there are stencils in it, so you can invent a bicycle or glasses safely.  And there are butterflies there :) Probably, there you can just fold the handle and adapter itself and the number of boxes will decrease. <br><br>  To draw plastic PLA on the handle, you need to set the temperature to the "PLA" position. <br><br>  Box number three: Watson Plastic <br>  About Watson Plastic Kit <br><br>  The names of the plastics are similar to the previous palette.  Quantity too: 10 skeins of 10 meters. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e1f/953/599/e1f953599062413d9bcd094ad4f97501.jpg"><br><br>  What is the difference between Watson plastic and PLA plastic? <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/43e/584/02c/43e58402c0b9437cad7d9e37ac6e496f.jpg"><br><br>  Watson plastic is a plastic with a high coefficient of light transmission (up to 93% of light).  It is ideal for crafts that imitate glass and precious stones.  It is more plastic compared to PLA plastic.  He does not smell either.  Why watson?  Perhaps the developers liked to read in his youth the works of Arthur Conan Doyle. <br><br>  To draw plastic Watson on the handle you need to set the temperature to the "ABS" position. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/9e1/38c/fe2/9e138cfe28664b5899330a1adf14082d.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c02/956/f96/c02956f96b06461494c91daeb15c7dc3.jpg"><br><br>  ABS plastic work <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e75/532/7ed/e755327ed6dc49eea679139be41fd184.jpg"><br><br>  Points are drawn PLA plastic <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/7cb/7d9/625/7cb7d96259cc49a8b59277ddd7730f61.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/01e/b41/995/01eb41995c3048fa8597ebaa885cecae.jpg"><br><br>  Miscellaneous Works (Watson / ABS, ABS / PLA and Watson / PLA) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/8b2/f65/bc3/8b2f65bc37ca4d35be6fa224b6ded7a5.jpg"><br><br>  <b>Findings:</b> <br><br>  A good gift for children 8-15 years.  That pen stand, that the WATSON palette and the PLA palette are relatively inexpensive, delight guaranteed.  So, in the light of the coming coming of Santa Claus, it is quite relevant. <br><br>  Disadvantages? .. Well, the main, in my opinion - a very fast consumption of material.  One medium-sized toy made of a continuous layer of plastic - and, count, there is no longer any single color in the palette. <br><br>  The perfect thing for the development of artistic skills and fine motor skills. <br><br>  The cherished <a href="https://dadget.ru/katalog/sdelay-sam/3d-ruchka-plus/%3Futm_referrer%3Dgeektimes.ru%26utm_source%3Dgeektimes.ru%26utm_medium%3Darticle%26utm_term%3D3d-ruchka-plus%26utm_content%3D3d-ruchka-plus%26utm_campaign%3D3d-ruchka-plus_442">3Dali Plus pen</a> , <a href="https://dadget.ru/katalog/roditelyam/3dpalitra-pla/%3Futm_referrer%3Dgeektimes.ru%26utm_source%3Dgeektimes.ru%26utm_medium%3Darticle%26utm_term%3D3dpalitra-pla%26utm_content%3D3dpalitra-pla%26utm_campaign%3D3dpalitra-pla_444">the PLA palette with bright and versatile plastics</a> , the <a href="https://dadget.ru/katalog/roditelyam/3dpalitra-watson/%3Futm_referrer%3Dgeektimes.ru%26utm_source%3Dgeektimes.ru%26utm_medium%3Darticle%26utm_term%3D3dpalitra-watson%26utm_content%3D3dpalitra-watson%26utm_campaign%3D3dpalitra-watson_443">Watson transparent plastic palette for making semi-and transparent details</a> can be bought with a 10% discount on the GEEKT-3DPEN promotional code within 14 days from the date of publication. <br><br>  Author Pavel Ievlev (Semiurg), Voronezh <br><br>  <b>Information for bloggers and authors:</b> <br><br>  The company "Dadzhet" is interested in publishing independent objective reviews of dadzhetov in various kinds of media.
