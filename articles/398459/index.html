  <section class="page js-page"><h1>UP. Similar to Pi2, Intel only</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  In October last year, a crowdfunding campaign to raise funds for the <a href="http://www.up-board.org/">Up card was</a> <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/802007522/up-intel-x5-z8300-board-in-a-raspberry-pi2-form-fa">launched</a> on the website kikstarter with a Raspberry Pi2 computer and Intel Atom processor.  As we know from the news, not all projects, even of interesting ones, are started up from the pusher.  However, in this case, everything turned out to be as good as possible: the honesty of the developers, the reasonableness of the project and the financial support of the users - and now only after 5 months the first sample was sent to the customer.  In this post - the characteristics of the UP board, benchmarks, as well as arguments about who needs all this. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b79/134/8c8/b791348c807044abaf10c4bd73a11a89.jpg"></div><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Let's start with the last one.  The development of the ‚ÄúInternet of things‚Äù dramatically changed the situation in the field of intellectual objects and devices.  Previously, it was a passion of enthusiasts with the corresponding volume of demand and supply profile.  Now we are witnessing the transition of all sorts of ‚Äúsmart X‚Äù to the mainstream category, they are engaged in absolutely all players on the market, both large and small.  Success in this field depends primarily on the correct choice of hardware and time to market, which implies the availability of this very foundation and the convenience of working with it.  Therefore, it is not by chance that the UP developers chose their bridge the gap slogan - bridge the gap between the idea and its embodiment, the prototype and the production model.  They are positioning the board as a product for those who want to make a successful project with minimal effort. <br><br>  The creators note the following advantages of their offspring:

    <ul><li>  Compatible design with Raspberry Pi2, which provides access to a wide range of expansion cards from the ‚Äúraspberry‚Äù.  By the way, the manufacturers of Pi2 strongly approved the emergence of UP and are planning to work together. </li><li>  High performance with small sizes.  Below we show the results of benchmarks, really impressive. </li><li>  Relatively low cost - from $ 99 per base. </li></ul><br>  UP key features <br><table><tbody><tr><td>  CPU </td><td>  Intel Atom x5-Z8350 (4 cores, 1.9 GHz, Cherry Trail) </td></tr><tr><td>  Memory </td><td>  1/2/4 GB DDR3 </td></tr><tr><td>  Storage </td><td>  16/32/64 GB eMMC </td></tr><tr><td>  Interfaces </td><td>  40 GPIO, 6 USB 2.0, USB 3.0 OTG </td></tr><tr><td>  Video camera </td><td>  MIPI CSI, DSI, HDMI </td></tr><tr><td>  Network </td><td>  Gigabit ethernet </td></tr><tr><td>  Supported OS </td><td>  Ubilinux, Yocto, Ubuntu, MS Windows 10 </td></tr></tbody></table>  Now promised performance slides.  All results of benchmarks can be viewed <a href="http://openbenchmarking.org/result/1608052-HA-1608034HA54">here</a> , in a post we give two pictures: computational power (solving the Poisson equation) by itself and in terms of cost. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/453/378/4ac/4533784ace164211aee0e2db8929d1e2.png"></div><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/251/8cf/b30/2518cfb30428499ba7f95979e43c607b.png"></div><br>  In other performance tests, the picture is about the same.  UP shows an advantage over the rest, mainly due to the Intel Atom x5 processor, not the latest generation, but affordable and still very powerful.  We note in particular the graphics subsystem of the processor, which can ‚Äúpull‚Äù how much FullHD resolution flows ‚Äî just space compared to its counterparts. <br><br>  In addition to the expansion cards from the Raspberry Pi2 ecosystem, two additional additional maps are available for UP.  The 502SSD card connects to the UP mSATA SSD Drive (up to 1 TB), a Wi-Fi 802.11b / g / n adapter with support for Soft-AP.  Additional ‚Äúbuns‚Äù of the board are the RTC with a battery, a temperature sensor and two USB ports.  UP with wearing 502SSD module is shown in the photo. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/395/c53/64e/395c5364e8fd4666b2e503a12c5ca775.jpg"></div><br>  The 503U3G communication module adds a 3G modem, Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) and Wi-Fi 802.11b / g / nc support for Soft-AP to the UP.  It also connects to two UART connectors and is equipped with RS-232 or RS-485 buffers (selected by jumpers) and a DB-9 connector for diagnostic needs. <br><br>  We found plenty of advantages in UP, and what about the disadvantages?  I see them two.  The first one is Russian, specific: IoT dvizhuha is passing by us.  Getting the components is problematic, although UP can be said to be lucky - Russians can buy a card and gadgets to it <a href="http://gamma.spb.ru/novosti-proizvoditelej/aaeon/262-kompaniya-aaeon-zapustila-v-serijnoe-proizvodstvo-vstraivaemyj-odnoplatnyj-kompyuter-c-nazvaniem-up-razmerom-s-kreditnuyu-kartu">from Gamma</a> ... The second is technical: in some cases, under heavy load, UP has to be equipped with active cooling ( <a href="http://up-shop.org/up-peripherals/64-active-cooler-fan-for-the-up-board.html">sold</a> in the UP store).  This, of course, is not true, although, judging by the calmness in the community, overheating is not a problem for UP. <br><br>  Finally, the final news for those interested in the UP board.  On October 31, that is, less than two weeks later, the company-developer AAEON intends to launch a fundraising fund for the next generation of motherboards called UP <sup>2</sup> .  Surely they will be based on the latest generation of Intel Atom, that is, more powerful and more economical (and they will not need a cooler).  Maybe someone wants to buy a little future for their money. <br><br>  <i>We thank Mikhail <a href="https://geektimes.ru/users/mstsvetk/" class="user_link">mstsvetk</a> Tsvetkov for help in writing the post.</i> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/398459/">https://habr.com/ru/post/398459/</a></p>
