This is a real international intellectual Olympiad, which opens the way for the participants to a great successful career.  Participating in the Imagine Cup 2013, you do not just get a diploma or a medal, or some kind of prize, you get the opportunity to show yourself in front of the leaders of the leading IT companies in the world. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/ca3/029/bf9/ca3029bf9612cb8418e8c4e96f322f88.jpg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Imagine Cup is the world's largest annual technology competition, sponsored by Microsoft.  The competition can be attended by graduate students and students from around the world, in a team or individually.  Your goal - using your knowledge and creative abilities, to demonstrate how technology can help in solving modern global problems. <br><br>  Imagine Cup is a real Olympiad, the main thing here is not victory, but participation.  Each participant is already in some sense a winner.  The victory itself often depends on the case, but your talent and knowledge will definitely be noticed.  Contest participants are often invited for internships, investors notice promising projects.

      There is no need to go far for examples.  We all know the well-known <a href="http://www.facebook.com/mixen">Mikhail Chernomodikov</a> , head of the Microsoft Russia expert group in the Department of Strategic Technologies, most recently a student at IC, according to the results of IC, Misha becomes an intern at Microsoft, then an evangelist, and now Misha is the manager of a successful team that tackles the company's strategic tasks.  And this is just one of many examples. <br><br>  Enough lyrics, now the main thing.  This year's competition is unique in that the size of prizes and nominations has significantly increased.  Everyone will find a competition for their interests and ambitions, but the most ambitious competition of IC has always been and remains a competition of software projects.  Previously, the competition had one nomination and one main prize.  Because of what the competition simply went off scale, it was extremely difficult to choose a winner from hundreds of wonderful projects. <br><br>  This year, for the first time in the competition of software projects, there were 3 categories in which you can express yourself: <br><ul><li>  Innovation </li><li>  Social projects </li><li>  Games. </li></ul><br>  Project competitions are the most prestigious international categories of the Imagine Cup.  Teams of senior schoolchildren (over 16), students and graduate students from 1 to 4 people can participate in them.  A team may also have a manager, from among the employees of the university, participants of previous years. <br><br>  Within the framework of competitions, it is necessary to invent an idea and develop a prototype information system.  Selects the winner of the jury, consisting of independent experts, representatives of leading universities, industry, press and start-up community.  Contests are held first in the regions, and the winners meet in Moscow at the Russian final.  And as the organizer, the best teams from Russia in each category will represent our country in the international final.  The rest of the countries choose one best team from 3 categories. <br><br>  Mercantile side of the issue.  For each category 3 cash prizes are awarded: <br><ul><li>  $ 50,000 - 1st place </li><li>  $ 10 000 - 2 place </li><li>  $ 5 000 - 3 place </li></ul><br>  Which category to choose, it's up to you, but I was lucky to get an Innovation contest, of which I am the curator.  This is the most close to real life and thus an interesting competition. <br><br>  I will not waste time explaining what <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2598%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B0%25D1%2586%25D0%25B8%25D1%258F">innovation is</a> .  I can only say that in order to participate in the competition, it is necessary to invent and implement an innovative software project on the Microsoft platform (using Windows, Kinect, Windows Phone, ASP.NET, XBox or other Microsoft technologies).  Think of your innovative service, implement its software prototype, think over the business model and rehearse your presentation. <br><br>  Where to begin: <br><ul><li>  Come up with an idea.  Take a look around, pay attention to the fact that you are not comfortable with existing technologies, which can be done qualitatively better.  An idea for your future project somewhere nearby.  Pay attention to areas where there have not been breakthroughs for a long time.  Try not to go to extremes.  Giordano Bruno, for example, was also an innovator, but he was not understood and the story ended badly.  At the other extreme, write a flashlight application and pass it off as an innovation.  Be pragmatic. </li><li>  Gather a team.  The main thing is to recruit necessary and useful specialists to the team.  Anyone who can work hard on a project, developers, designers, architects, testers will be useful. </li><li>  Apply <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/rus/imaginecup">for a competition</a> . </li><li>  Start developing a prototype.  Work well on the implementation plan.  Before the big international final you will need to demonstrate the project at least 2 times, at the regional selection and at the Russian final.  The project should work just as much as it is necessary for the jury to understand your innovative idea.  Therefore, in the first and second releases, choose exactly those opportunities that best illustrate your idea.  It is not necessary to polish the project to the ideal, leave time to prepare the presentation, 60% of success depends on it. </li><li>  Loving your project is your legacy.  Prepare the best in your life presentation, make a project site, be attentive to the details - icons, design, logo, name.  From the little things formed the overall picture. </li></ul><br>  This time we will be with you throughout the competition: <br><ul><li>  Every competition has a mentor.  For the Innovation Contest, it's me, Denis Kotlyarov.  The task of the mentor is to help you as much as you can.  Mentors of other competitions are carefully selected and will present themselves to you in the near future.  Feel free to write to the mentors of your competitions, ask questions.  Remember, there is no problem only for someone who does nothing. </li><li>  Already in January, at the regional stages, we will launch a series of web castes telling the wisdom of making a successful presentation, technological subtleties and other useful information to help you in your preparation. </li><li>  A few days before the Russian final, we will gather participants to personally work with the finalists on demonstrations and presentations. </li><li>  The 3 projects that will represent Russia in the international final will receive additional expert support at the final stage of preparation. </li></ul><br>  For any questions regarding the Imagine Cup in general and for the innovation competition in particular, please contact us at <a href="">rusacad@microsoft.com</a> .  If you have a suggestion, recommendations, want to be a volunteer, just an observer, write, we will be happy to answer your questions.  In the year when the final is held in our homeland, we must win the international final. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/155253/">https://habr.com/ru/post/155253/</a></p>
