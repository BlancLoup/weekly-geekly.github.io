      The company even specifically conducted research in the US and global markets with Forrester, and found that about two-thirds of corporate projects involving the use of numerous computing resources require more time and money than originally planned.  By investing huge amounts of money in IT infrastructure, which then can ‚Äúeat up‚Äù up to 70% of the budget surcharge, even if it is idle, even very successful companies may not have enough money to finance new developments. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ba7/6ef/0bc/ba76ef0bc74e6e59a9885944354fd489.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  So what exactly is inside this magic box that has cost IBM a $ 2 billion research investment over the past 4 years? <br><br>  PureSystems consists of: <br><br><h5>  "Scalable Design" System </h5><br>  For the first time in PureSystems, a new technology has been applied to design a system that combines server, storage and network devices into one automated and easy-to-manage machine.  This design makes it easy to increase the "density" of the computational load - PureSystems machines can work with twice as many applications, compared to some other IBM products, thus greatly increasing the computing power per cubic meter of the data center. <br><br><h5>  "Examination Models" </h5><br>  For the first time in the industry, IBM, with the help of specialized software, allowed the system to incorporate all the developments of the largest companies in the field of solving the simplest tasks of setting up, configuring, upgrading and achieving application compatibility. <br><br><h5>  Integration with the cloud "out of the box" </h5><br>  By default, all PureSystems are built to meet the requirements of the cloud, can be organized into a single closed or open cloud structure, with automatic and easy to manage scaling. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/549/15e/8c3/54915e8c3315a8c17f1b1598434e2a00.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Here is what Steve Hamms writes on the <a href="http://asmarterplanet.com/blog/2012/04/solving-corporate-computing%25E2%2580%2599s-dilemma-by-blending-simplicity-and-flexibility.html">Smart Planet blog</a> : <br><blockquote>  ‚ÄúIn the modern world, IT companies and their leaders, who not only have to keep track of tasks, but also company revenues, can only be purchased by computing" semi-finished products ", which are pre-prepared and pre-configured tools designed to solve a relatively narrow circle tasks, but the power of which can be deployed relatively quickly.  We are stuck in this reality.  In principle, anyone can buy today the ‚Äúspare parts‚Äù needed to solve specific tasks or calculations in general: servers, network equipment, storage and so on - and put it all together or hire someone who brings it together.  Such an approach is relatively complex and takes a lot of time and effort. <br><br>  The solution is an expert integrated system that has three key elements.  First, you standardize the hardware elements so that they can be stapled together as Lego blocks.  Secondly, you pre-integrate the hardware and software parts based on the experience of what configuration is most successful for solving a specific task - we call them ‚Äúmodels‚Äù. <br><br>  Finally, you need to provide the initial flexibility of the entire system in order to expand or change its configuration depending on the requirements.  Our main idea is that companies will start using PureSystems with minimal initial modifications, quickly realizing how easy it is to deploy and use IBM systems, and after that they will begin to expand their own systems in accordance with their internal desires. <br></blockquote><br>  As I already wrote, all IBM systems of the PureSystems family are designed for use in the cloud.  Connecting virtualized servers, storage and network equipment in one box, anyone can buy a ‚Äúready-made cloud‚Äù, which requires minimal configuration and is ready to go from start. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/793/4cb/e60/7934cbe6048781a70fb852602fd53cac.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  IBM experts hope that PureSystems will help accelerate the adoption of cloud technologies in a corporate environment, Maoxin Guow comments on: <br><br><blockquote>  The essence of IBM PureSystems is to provide a ready-made infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS), where customers receive a secure model for computing and storing data, as well as other computer resources and tools to use.  All this together allows you to quickly and flexibly roll out and provide resources for the deployment of software and services without first needing to take care of the hardware.  We are proud that we were able to achieve almost twice the peak load of PureSystems in virtualized systems in comparison with previous generation IBM solutions. <br><br>  In addition, IBM PureSystems customers can use the platform to deploy software on a SaaS model.  Our company has a huge and open ecosystem of partners who are ready and able to provide their experience and solutions to our customers attracted by the simple use of PureSystems.  Already today more than 100 optimized application packages are available for the platform, but you can also launch your own solution with a flexible deployment model on PureSystems (in a private or open cloud). <br></blockquote><br><br>  The first two models of PureSystems: <a href="http://www.ibm.com/ibm/puresystems/ru/ru/">PureFlex</a> and <a href="http://www.ibm.com/ibm/puresystems/ru/ru/">PureApplication</a> , which support Power and Intel processors, will be available in the second quarter of this year for IBM customers around the world. <br><br>  More than 600 companies worldwide have announced their support for IBM PureSystems, including system integrators, service and service developers.  Very soon we will find out whether IBM has been able to offer companies the ‚Äúmagic box‚Äù that everyone has been waiting for for more than a decade. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/142377/">https://habr.com/ru/post/142377/</a></p>
