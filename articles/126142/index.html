    <h4>  Mac OS =&gt; Linux </h4><br><br>  On the part of the Mac user, the transition to Linux is a complete disaster, because exactly half of it intuitively becomes incomprehensible.  It is possible that this problem is solved by choosing an alternative graphical shell, but I did not have the right choice specifically - the workplace was organized specifically with Gnome (for reference, work in the technical support service of a hosting provider).  In the future, it becomes even worse when to solve any problems you have to resort to editing configs manually.  Of course, linuxsoids can laugh, but when in 6 years you open / etc / hosts to insert a record and nothing else, it‚Äôs scary, in Mac OS there‚Äôs never such a necessity.  A novelty has also become the system for organizing applications in Linux.  One file with the .app extension in the .dmg image seems to be just manna from heaven compared to installing and placing applications in Linux, but only at first glance. <br><br><h4>  The story of my transition </h4><br><br>  It so happened that the key moment in the choice of employees in our company became ‚Äúlearnability‚Äù and ‚Äúthe ability to learn quickly and independently‚Äù.  Perhaps that is what hooked me.  When it became known to me that I would have to work on Linux, perhaps only delight arose - I knew that my MacBook was not going anywhere from me. <br><br>  Starting to work in Linux immediately think exactly half.  This half is something that can be used with Gnome (I suspect that this is far from half).  During the first month of interaction with Linux, I strongly rejected the console.  One of her views caused distrust and disgust in me.  After Finder, use cd, ls, mv, rm, mkdir - this is some kind of absurdity.  Later, makovody friends, at the sight of my interactions in the terminal with the files on the Mac, were bulging and straining.  In the eyes of a typical makovod, these are ‚Äúponty‚Äù, ‚Äúperversion‚Äù and one logical stamp - ‚Äúwhy complicate things?‚Äù.  However, it‚Äôs really hard to complicate when there is a Finder at hand ‚Äî it‚Äôs not worth it, but ... when the hell it isn‚Äôt ... <br><br>  Maybe I didn‚Äôt understand the philosophy of the standard Gnome file manager, but I don‚Äôt remember anything more disgusting about Linux.  Perhaps it was he who taught me to perform all file operations from the console. <br><br>  A huge plus after becoming acquainted with Linux seemed to me to work on ssh with other machines.  Previously, I only needed ssh access in order to upload maps of St. Petersburg and the region to the iPhone, and I limited myself to the CyberDuck client ‚Äî working with files.  The beauty of ssh was just full access to the machine and the use of various utilities, it seemed to me incredibly interesting and useful. <br><br>  Another advantage that I learned after using Linux was a bunch of useful utilities such as grep, awk, vim, etc.  Especially happy to write your own shell scripts right on the command line.  After the experience of programming in other languages, the shell, although it was more difficult for me, to learn personally from me, but it‚Äôs quite real and productive for myself. <br>  I admit, the use of Linux is currently limited to some specific number of commands, but this is not because they don‚Äôt master it, but because they don‚Äôt need more. <br><br>  Regarding the organization of programs in both systems ... I did not go deep into the installation process of applications in Linux - perhaps this is not very interesting for me, but I was told that usually the program is placed in different directories, that after one application file in Mac OS (yes, there is there are more application components in the Library directory, but they are not critical, usually these are cache and some saves) also scary a little.  The only thing that was incredibly pleased against this background is the standard application installation utility (with and without the interface).  All applications with descriptions and even screenshots are very conveniently assembled (the principle of Cydia operation on the iPhone has become clear). <br><br><h4>  Overall impression </h4><br><br>  The absence of a single-type interface in the entire system is a minus to the Linux recycle bin, this is a bit rejecting.  The presence of any buns in Linux - minus in the basket Mac OS.  The lack of support for iOS devices on current firmware in Linux is a minus.  Organization of application management - plus Linux.  In fact, the architectures are identical, most of the commands that I use at work also help me at home with poppies, but not all of them.  I solved the problem very simply - I started using apt-get on Mac OS and I don‚Äôt know grief yet.  What is missing now will be established in a minute.  All the functionality of Linux is smartly suited for networking, as it seemed to me, namely for developers and experienced users.  The only difference is that in Linux it is ‚Äúout of the box‚Äù, and in Mac OS it is optional.  In other words: ‚ÄúIn order for Linux to become more user-friendly, crutches are required, for Mac OS to become more functional, crutches are required.‚Äù <br><br>  To be completely honest - I liked Linux, I even put it as a second system on my laptop as an experiment.  During these very experiments, I concluded that ... I could give my mother a MacBook, and put Linux on EEE 901 and that would be enough for me if it were not for one BUT. <br><br>  Someday, Apple will make iTunes and for Linux, my mother will work on a Mac, and I will be dropping 9 hours on EEE from battery, reigning with some regular garbage that didn't start (well, it happens sometimes, once a month it is stable ).  There is no possibility to leave the iPhone and iPad without a big brother, they are still the same favorites that help out (by the way, working with the iPad is also quite convenient). <br>  In the meantime, I‚Äôm sitting on a Mac OS, everything I use at work in Ubuntu can also be used at home.  In a pinch, there is delineated ssh access on home machines, which regularly helps out. <br><br>  Linux and Mac OS despite their similarity - different systems.  This is due to many factors (number one - commerce Mac OS), but, as they say, to each his own. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/126142/">https://habr.com/ru/post/126142/</a></p>
