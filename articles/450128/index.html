I was interested in the topic for several years, I experimented a lot, gained experience and I want to share it.  The article expresses my personal opinion, you may disagree with it. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h3>  Background </h3><br>  Sony digital cameras with interchangeable optics appeared on the market in 2006 after Sony acquired Konica Minolta.  At one time, Minolta in 1985 first launched to the market its mass models of film SLR cameras with interchangeable lenses with autofocus system.  Thus, Minolta AF bayonet lenses (or Minolta A or Sony A mount) have been manufactured since 1985.  A feature of the original Minolta AF system is the placement of the focus drive in the camera and its pairing with the lens using a so-called ‚Äúscrewdriver‚Äù.  The drive of the diaphragm was also located in the chamber.  The first digital DSLR camera with a Minolta AF bayonet was called Konica Minolta Dynax 7D (Maxxum 7D in the Americas) and was released in 2004. <br><br>  A feature of the camera was the image stabilization system built into the camera, based on the shift of the matrix.  In the same year, a simplified and cheaper version was released - Konica Minolta Dynax 5D.  Both models were equipped with incomplete frame (crop factor 1.53) 6 megapixel matrices.  In 2006, Sony released its first Sony Alpha A100 SLR camera, based on the Konica Minolta Dynax 5D, with a new 10 megapixel matrix (crop factor 1.5).  In 2008, Sony released its first full-frame SLR camera, the Sony Alpha DSLR-A900, with a 24-megapixel matrix, the physical size of which (35.9 x 24 mm) corresponded to the frame size of 35 mm film. <br><br>  Sony produced traditional SLR cameras (with a rising mirror) until 2010.  In 2010, cameras with a fixed translucent mirror of the Sony Alpha SLT series and Sony A (Minolta A) bayonet, as well as a new series of mirrorless Sony NEX cameras with the new Sony E bayonet (E mount), were presented and launched.  In the mirrorless cameras of Sony NEX, the lens control is completely electric, the aperture and autofocus drives are built into the lens.  Also in some models of lenses optical image stabilization was implemented.  Mirrorless NEX series used APS-C format matrices with a crop factor of 1.5.

      In mirrorless NEX cameras released before 2012, autofocus was performed using a contrast method.  Since there is no mirror in the cameras, there are no fast autofocus phase sensors.  Because of this, the mirrorless NEX was significantly losing in the speed of high-quality shooting and could not claim to be a mass professional tool.  The NEX-7 model, which appeared in 2011, was positioned as a professional tool, but was not widely used due to the high price and still contrasting autofocus.  The LA-EA2 autofocus adapter (with a translucent mirror and phase autofocus system) made it possible to turn the NEX-7 into a more expensive analogue of the Sony SLT-A65 SLR camera.  The quality of the photographs in the NEX-7 and SLT-A65 was about the same.  The cameras of the NEX series were still rather expensive, but an interesting gadget than a working tool. <br>  The situation began to change in 2012.  Were released model NEX-6 and NEX-5R, equipped with a matrix with sensors phase autofocus.  99 sensors were placed directly on the matrix and this made it possible to speed up autofocusing by several times. <br><br>  In 2013, the first full-frame mirrorless camera from Sony, ILCE-A7, was released.  Also available are E-mount full-frame lenses, marked with FE to distinguish from E-labeled lenses designed for Crop cameras. <br><br>  The E-series full-frame lens can be used on an A7 full-frame camera ‚Äî the camera recognizes such lenses and goes into Crop mode ‚Äî only the center of the matrix is ‚Äã‚Äãused and the resolution is reduced to 10 megapixels.  The A7 camera was equipped with 117 phase autofocus sensors placed on the matrix.  However, image stabilization was still provided only with lenses labeled Optical Steadyshot (OSS). <br><br>  Then came the A7 - A7R camera (with high resolution - 36 megapixels) and A7S (with high sensitivity and low resolution - 12 megapixels), equipped only with contrast autofocus.  The A7S camera was popular with amateur video and became widely used for semi-professional video shooting. <br><br>  In 2014, the second version of the A7, the Sony ILCE-A7M2, equipped with an image-based image stabilization system, appeared on the market.  In 2015, the A7S, A7R versions received an update.  They also had a stabilization of the matrix and the A7RM2 appeared sensors of phase autofocus and the resolution of the matrix was 42 megapixels.  A7SM2 is still deprived of phase autofocus, however, it had significantly improved opportunities for video shooting. <br><br>  The Sony ILCE-A7RM2 camera can already be called a professional tool, as it in a compact package exceeded the capabilities of the Sony SLT-A99 full-frame mirror camera, released in 2012.  Sony SLT-A99M2 SLR-A99M2, which was updated in 2016, has already ‚Äúcaught up‚Äù with the A7 family mirrorless.  We can say that since 2015, mirrorless cameras have become Sony's leading cameras. <br><br>  In 2017, a new series of mirrorless Sony A9 full-frame cameras appeared, and in 2018, the third-generation A7 and A7R full-frame cameras were released. <br><br>  The Crop series of NEX models also developed and in 2014 received excellent new A5100 models (Sony ILCE-5100) and A6000 (Sony ILCE-6000).  I owned both for some time and still use the A5100.  This is a convenient, compact camera with fast autofocus, good image quality and a swivel screen (180 degrees) that allows you to take selfies (photos and videos).  This model is convenient to travel, very popular with video bloggers and is still for sale.  The A6000 model has more advanced control than the A5100 and a higher burst speed.  It probably uses a more reliable and durable shutter mechanism. <br><br>  In 2016, the A6000 series update was released - the new A6300 model (Sony ILCE-6300).  Among the advantages of the new model is the ability to shoot 4K video clips and video clips with a frequency of 100 (120) frames, which allows you to make high-quality slow-motion videos.  The autofocus speed was again improved and the number of phase sensors increased.  Now there are more than 400 of them and they cover almost the entire area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe frame. <br><br>  In the same 2016, the model A6500 (Sony ILCE-6500), equipped with a system for image stabilization based on the matrix shift, appeared on the market.  At the moment, this is Sony's top croc mirrorless camera with Sony E. bayonet. It is a good tool for reportage photo and video shooting. <br><br>  Personally, comparing the models A7RM2 (2014) and A6500 (2016), I chose the A6500 camera.  For my needs, a crop matrix is ‚Äã‚Äãquite sufficient, while high-quality optics designed for crocod cameras are much cheaper.  For example, the Sigma E 1.4 / 56 mm crope lens is 2.5 times cheaper than a full-frame Zeiss FE 1.8 / 55 mm with a comparable image quality and greater luminosity. <br><br><h3>  Available optics selection </h3><br>  What choice of optics is available today for Sony mirrorless cameras? <br><br>  Firstly, these are ‚Äúnative‚Äù lenses specifically designed for the Sony E mount (marked E and FE).  These are modern lenses with electrically controlled focusing and aperture.  Lenses made by Sony are often equipped with fast and quiet ultrasonic AF motors.  High-quality autofocus lenses with a nice price are also offered by Sigma.  Samyang offers good quality lenses with both manual and auto focus.  Also on sale are interesting and inexpensive manual lenses of modern Chinese production for bayonet E. Personally, I think that for reportage photography it is better to choose a modern autofocus lens made by Sony.  My choice is the Sony Zeiss FE 24-70 F4 OSS - a versatile full-frame lens with optical stabilizations that can be used with both Crop and full-frame cameras.  It is great for daylight shooting.  I prefer to use more high-aperture modern autofocus ‚Äúfixes‚Äù in the rooms - Sony Zeiss E 1.8 / 24, Sigma 1.4 / 56 and Sigma 1.4 / 16. <br><br>  Secondly, using the LA-EA3 (1) and LA-EA4 (2) adapters, you can use the autofocus optics park for the Minolta AF (Sony A mount) mount, produced since 1985 by many companies, not just Minolta and Sony.  This gives a huge selection of used lenses with good performance and at a very nice price. <br><br>  I'll tell you more about adapters. <br><br>  LA-EA1 - adapter for connecting motor lenses with bayonet A to cropping cameras with bayonet E with contacts for controlling aperture and electric focusing.  An excellent option is to use Sony DT DT lenses with SAM and SSM focusing drives with this adapter.  For example, using this adapter and a Sony DT 2.8 / 16-50 SSM lens, you can get high-quality and inexpensive reportage optics with excellent performance.  For Sony E bayonet there are no affordable and high-quality aperture zoom lenses 2.8.  Therefore, the use of high-quality motor optics A-mount with an adapter Sony LA-EA1 is a good working option.  This adapter physically limits the image and when it is connected to a full-frame mirrorless image you will have a limited frame resolution (crop mode). <br><br>  LA-EA2 - adapter for connecting any lenses with bayonet A to crocod cameras with bayonet E, contains an autofocus module with a transparent mirror and a motor for controlling the focusing of ‚Äúscrewdriver‚Äù lenses.  This adapter will help you use A-mount "motorless" lenses.  The disadvantage of this adapter is a rather primitive autofocus system by modern standards.  Sensors autofocus are located mainly in the central part of the frame.  Using this adapter, you can turn an old mirrorless with a contrasting autofocus into a compact DSLR with a fairly fast phase autofocus and A-mount lenses.  This adapter also physically limits the picture and when it is connected to a full-frame mirrorless image you will have a limited frame resolution (crop mode). <br><br>  LA-EA3 - adapter for connecting motor lenses with bayonet A to full-frame and crocod cameras with bayonet E with contacts for controlling aperture and electric focusing.  Allows you to use A-mount full-frame motor lenses on full-frame mirrorless cameras.  The most justified use of this adapter is to create a reportage system based on a Sony Zeiss 2.8 / 24-70 SSM lens (first or second version).  These lenses are able to compete with the modern Sony FE 24‚Äì70 mm F2.8 GM lens (for 175 tr.) For picture quality.  A set of Sony LA-EA3 adapter and Sony Zeiss 2.8 / 24-70 SSM lens will cost more than 2 times cheaper with a comparable quality of the final image. <br><br>  LA-EA4 - adapter for connecting any lenses with bayonet A to full-frame and cropping cameras with bayonet E, contains an autofocus module with a transparent mirror and a motor for controlling the focusing of ‚Äúscrewdriver‚Äù lenses.  Same as LA-EA2, only there are no physical limits on frame size.  I come to mind only one sensible use of this adapter - along with the first-generation Sony A7R and A7S cameras, which did not have phase autofocus. <br><br>  I owned LA-EA3 and LA-EA2 adapters, used them with different lenses and cameras.  When I was planning to buy such an adapter, I was sorely lacking information on the network to make the right choice.  In stores in the presence of both types of adapters are not common.  I hope my review has clarified for you the differences in adapter models and usage scenarios. <br><br>  Thirdly, using non-autofocus adapters (which are simply metal pipes with corresponding tips), you can use almost any non-autofocus optics, originally intended for many other bayonettes.  A popular option is to use Soviet-made M42 and M39 thread lenses.  Manual lenses (with manual control of the aperture and focus) are well suited for subject, landscape and artistic shooting.  At the same time, they are very inexpensive with fairly good picture quality. <br><br><h3>  How to use A-mount lenses on Sony mirrorless? </h3><br>  With the help of adapters, which I described above.  We determine the models of lenses and see their type - whether they are motorized or non-motorized.  Sony's motor lenses come with the name SAM or SSM.  Pro models from other manufacturers can be read online.  Motorless lens can be determined visually.  On the bayonet, you will see a round cog with a diameter of about 5 mm with a flat slot.  This is the counterpart of the so-called "screwdriver" drive.  For non-motorized lenses, only the LA-EA2 and LA-EA4 adapters are suitable.  If you want to use old Minolta optics, then only these adapters will do. <br><br>  If the lenses you are interested in are relatively modern models with their own autofocusing drives and you have a modern camera (A6000, A6300, A6500, A6400 or A7 of the second or third generation), then you can use the LA-EA3 adapter.  The LA-EA1 adapter is now quite rare and I generally do not recommend contacting it. <br><br>  Motor lenses work great with the LA-EA2 and LA-EA4 adapters, but you should keep in mind that autofocus will work due to the built-in mirror adapter focusing system.  In modern cameras, phase autofocus works much better than the mirror system built into the adapter, so in this case (motor lens + modern camera) it is better to use the adapter LA-EA3. <br><br>  In addition, a translucent mirror still delays part of the world and you will have to use longer exposures. <br><br><h3>  Why use? </h3><br>  The main point is to get a high-quality picture by spending much less money on optics.  Either you already have good Minolta / Sony A bayonet lenses and you don‚Äôt want to sell them and buy new ones.  Either you have a limited budget and high-quality modern optics do not fit into it. <br><br>  My experiments ultimately led me to purchase enough high-quality modern lenses with a Sony E. mount. I sold almost all of the Minolta / Sony A mount lenses and the LA-EA2 adapter.  I still have an LA-EA3 motor lens adapter and Sony DT 2.8 / 16-50 SSM and Sony DT 4-5.6 / 55-200 SAM zoom lenses.  The first is because of the very high-quality picture and good luminosity.  And the second because of the acceptable quality and very cheap prices.  Selling such a lens makes little sense.  At the same time, he gives a completely suitable picture. <br><br><h3>  When does using Minolta / Sony A optics on mirrorless makes sense? </h3><br>  When you have a limited budget, and you do not plan to shoot dynamic scenes, while you want to get a high quality picture. <br><br>  For dynamic plots, it is better to use either a SLR or a modern mirrorless camera with ‚Äúnative‚Äù lenses. <br><br>  If you don‚Äôt chase a high quality picture and you are satisfied ‚Äúa little better than on a smartphone‚Äù, then you shouldn‚Äôt bother at all - just buy a native lens for the money you are willing to spend.  Sony's Whale PowerZoom 16-50 is quite suitable for shooting in good daylight, and inexpensive Sigma fixes with the E-mount Art series bayonet and 2.8 aperture give you a more pleasant picture for quite reasonable money (comparable to the cost of old lenses with A-mount bayonet ). <br><br>  If you know situations when using old Minolta / Sony A format on mirrors is justified, please tell us about this comment. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/450128/">https://habr.com/ru/post/450128/</a></p>
