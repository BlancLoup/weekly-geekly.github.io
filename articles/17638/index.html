And order in business is generally in many cases a utopian dream.  Software for business management, as a rule, is designed for large companies and complex integration, overloaded with options, and their interface is prohibitive.  A person, having logged into the system for the first time, is confused in a heap of buttons, check marks and various work scenarios. <br><br>  We discovered this, faced, like many, with the problem of rapid business growth.  Our company has grown - business growth has led to an increase in the volume and scope of tasks, and the growth of the staff has made management less obvious (and we are still far from becoming a corporation with thousands of employees).  Not finding an adequate software solution to fit our needs, we assembled a Jedi development team and made <a href="http://www.megaplan.ru/">Megaplan</a> . <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Megaplan is a series of software products for managing a business of any size (from freelancers to medium-sized companies) and specifics (IT, commerce, services, manufacturing, etc.). <br><br>  In general, we proceeded from the fact that any business is a solution to problems.  To solve a problem, it is necessary to formulate it, understand by what time it should be solved and who will be engaged in it.  Therefore, in the first place, we have made a convenient tool for setting and controlling the execution of tasks - Task Manager.

      In Task Manager, in two or three clicks, you can assign a task to any employee of the company, these are tasks that were previously ‚Äúset‚Äù orally, by mail, by ICQ and then lost, forgotten and not performed.  Sometimes they were executed, of course :) Now the tasks are impossible to lose, because they are gathered in one place and their status can be seen at any moment.  And, by the way, thanks to the web interface, from anywhere. <br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://www.megaplan.ru/s/promo/i/screens/task-listf.png" width="600" height="433" alt="Megaplan - task list" hspace="10" vspace="10"></div><br><br>  Task Manager is designed for companies.  For freelancers (and groups of freelancers), we will soon release a Life Manager, and a personal planner, the Time Manager, is also on the way.  In the form of web services they will be free. <br><br>  In general, Task Manager is rather a boxed product.  It seems to us that companies are not yet ready to entrust their important tasks to incomprehensible servers on a mysterious and terrible Internet :) We will start selling boxes with Megaplan in January.  We will also have <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/SaaS">SaaS</a> (software rental), but, most likely, it will not be used by a very large part of our customers. <br><br>  The Megaplan interface was developed in the Art. Lebedev Studio.  It turned out functional and beautiful. <br>  By the way, taking this opportunity, we express Respect to the main interface developer - Dima Plotnikov! <br><br>  We start with an open beta test - we want to check everything and run in on real companies.  While the registration is free, but if there are too many interested people, we will introduce restrictions on the time until we connect additional servers. <br><br>  There are glitches and flaws in the existing beta version, but there are not many of them - the version is quite working.  Several companies are already using Task-manager and are satisfied, we ourselves also work in it and the order in work has become definitely more. <br><br>  At the time of testing, we are setting up a base for you in which you can (and should!) Really work. <br>  The test period will last about a month.  If you later want to buy a subscription or install it on your server, we will transfer all the data to the right place. <br>  More about all this - on the <a href="http://www.megaplan.ru/">site</a> .  There you can see the <a href="http://demo.megaplan.ru/">demo version</a> (registration is not required).  We are waiting for testers, commentators (essentially :), new friends and like-minded people! <br><br>  <b>UPD</b> It seems that at once it was not entirely obvious: in the demo version nothing can be saved, this is done on purpose so that it does not become clogged.  If you want your test database, in which you can work - <a href="http://www.megaplan.ru/megaplan/register/">register</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/17638/">https://habr.com/ru/post/17638/</a></p>
