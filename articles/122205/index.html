  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Brain computer interface. Part Three Weekdays</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Hello Habr. <br>  Three months ago, I posted reviews ( <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/gadgets/115055/">text</a> and <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/gadgets/115333/">video</a> ) on the <a href="http://emotiv.com/">Emotiv Epoc</a> brain-computer interface.  Received a large number of questions on how to use it, where to buy and in general how it is.  In order to somehow alleviate my fate, I made a short <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/qa/5705/">FAQ</a> .  But it only partially helped me. <br><br>  And so, 3 months have passed. <br><br>  The main wave of questions subsided.  But many are asked to tell, well, what's next?  Thoughts already read, or not yet?  No, I do not read.  But he promised to write an article with what happened during that time.  It turned out five mini-messages on the topic. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  First of all, I met a large number of developers in different parts of our country, and not only our country, who would like to write something for this device.  And on the one hand they succeed, but on the other not so much.  Bye, stuff cones.  Some simply confused and ordered a basic version, instead of developer versions.  Someone ordered two devices at once.  In general, I would say, the work is slowly moving forward, because this is only the beginning of such devices.  Plus session, plus summer.  Personally, after the diploma, I want to finish my implementation of a virtual keyboard for this device.  On the similarity, the keyboard <a href="http://www.intendix.com/">Intendix</a> , which was recently shown on CeBIT'e.  Someone writes an addon to the client for one of the MMORPG toys, someone is experimenting with photos and audio.  Someone just drives a cube and learns to control the mouse.  Potential applications are many.  I also bought half a liter of contact lens fluid.  Would you see a pharmacist in a pharmacy when I bought a bottle.

          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      Secondly, I climbed into several interesting communities on the topic.  <a href="http://emotiv.com/forum/">The official forum</a> , of course, is good, but obviously not enough.  I came across a community site that is developing a large universal <a href="http://bci2000.org/BCI2000/Home.html">library</a> for neurocomputer interfaces.  There is not only Emotiv Epoc, but many others, which have already been repeatedly mentioned in the pages of habrabra.  Stumbled upon, after all, the site of a large domestic community that deals with <a href="http://www.neuroscience.ru/">neuroscience</a> .  There are not only neural interfaces, there are many things on the subject.  Then you can simply follow the links of these sites.  About open communities like <a href="http://openeeg.sourceforge.net/">OpenEEG was</a> already mentioned in the comments to one of the previous articles.  Therefore, I will not repeat.  Another very good friend gave a link to the <a href="https://github.com/daeken/Emokit">source</a> , with which you can squeeze out a little more options from your device by making a small hack. <br><br>  Thirdly, recently saw this device on TV.  Paragraph of hate.  Journalists are such journalists.  Uncles with a clever view <a href="http://www.vesti.ru/doc.html%3Fid%3D451182%26cid%3D7">broadcast</a> about the device.  The device itself is shown from 1:15, it is impossible to make a mistake.  But I advise you to watch all the videos.  Frankly speaking, the feelings are contradictory.  Guests of the studio are talking about the site where you should register to try using the device.  I found this <a href="http://www.neurog.com/">site</a> .  Sharpened under Firefox.  But something I did not find anything sensible.  Actually, the <a href="http://tinyurl.com/5suagy4">discussion of</a> their activities.  I do not know.  End of hate paragraph. <br><br>  Fourth.  On May 9, in honor of Victory Day, he received guests with his relatives.  I was solemnly entrusted to entertain a twelve-year-old girl.  What I think and coped with.  In general, we pinned the device on it and tried to move the cube (as in one of the videos).  In 15 minutes she learned how to make 2 arbitrary movements and their combination of choice.  After another 5-10 minutes, she was able to work with three movements at the same time.  The fourth was with difficulty and in part. <br>  Wherein.  The interface was not completely connected to the head, as it is designed for adult size.  Therefore, only sensors in the back of the head and partially sensors in the middle of the head worked.  And it worked even in this mode!  In 15 minutes she did what I learned to do for 2 weeks and that does not always work for me.  Just in case, I checked her mother again (well, all of a sudden they have such a family).  Mom showed the usual result for beginners.  <s>The brain is absent.</s>  One movement and chaotic second. <br>  In general, a flexible young brain works wonders.  After consulting with a friend, we decided to catch a younger nephew and also try what happens.  There is also an assumption that due to the lack of signals with the frontal lobes (since it simply did not reach the entire head), there were no signal interferences, or the signal was simpler and therefore it worked out so easily.  It seems that the situation with recognition is better with several disconnected electrodes.  Again, you need to check and consult with more experienced comrades. <br><br>  And the last, fifth point.  I think the most important in today's article.  Something like running the device in combat conditions.  It so happened that fate brought me to one amazing person.  He generates very good ideas, catches everything on the fly, kind, sincere and understanding.  Looking for a wife.  And this, or a similar device, he really needs.  It really makes his life easier.  He has a rather severe <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2594%25D0%25B5%25D1%2582%25D1%2581%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B9_%25D1%2586%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B1%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BB%25D1%258C%25D0%25BD%25D1%258B%25D0%25B9_%25D0%25BF%25D0%25B0%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B8%25D1%2587">cerebral palsy</a> .  Friends from America suggested that he buy this device.  He bought it.  I helped him set up and learn how to use this device.  Only here, it turned out not very.  Though tried very hard.  In this disease, the brain encephalogram is different.  Plus tremor, which does not allow the use of signals from the muscles to the fullest.  Therefore, we could not use all the features of the device purely physically.  But even in these limited conditions, we were able to learn how to use the left and right mouse button.  And even a little wiggle it.  Frankly, I was struck by both perseverance and the speed with which the device was mastered.  But, unfortunately, with such use too much effort is required, with not very large output effect.  More traditional methods of input were less time consuming.  <s>As a result, now his device is lying idle.</s>  <s>If someone has a desire to purchase a device, knock me in PM.</s>  <strong>SOLD</strong> <br><br>  At his suggestion, in the near future, we will try to experiment with him with the <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2590%25D0%25B9%25D1%2582%25D1%2580%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B3">eytracking</a> system or, more precisely, geistracking.  Fortunately there are no problems here.  With me, as usual, a report or review.  Still as an option, he proposes to make sensors attached to the eyelids, to simulate mouse clicks.  <strong>But it is already necessary to solder the iron.</strong>  <strong>Anyone wanting to try doing such a thing?</strong> <br><br>  On this I have everything today.  Thanks for attention. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/122205/">https://habr.com/ru/post/122205/</a></p>
