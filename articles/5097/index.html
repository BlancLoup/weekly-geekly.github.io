  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The human issue in IT</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  <strong>Philip Guzenyuk: What are the main problems in the market of IT-specialists?</strong>  <strong>What are the main trends of the situation?</strong>  <strong>What does this market expect in the future?</strong> <br>  <strong>Mikhail Zavileisky:</strong> IT is a business infrastructure.  And when everything is fine with the infrastructure, we do not notice it.  We notice it when there are any problems.  Let us recall our attitude to the roads (logistics infrastructure) - a good road is invisible, a bad one causes anger, and repair and maintenance works are annoying. <br><a name="habracut"></a>  It is difficult to deal with infrastructure, but it is necessary, and therefore profitable.  Therefore, IT specialists are always lacking, they ask a lot of money for their services and, more often, they are not very social.  If you understand that this is natural, then there are no problems in the IT-specialists market - in Russia, the IT-profession is quite prestigious and quite a lot of specialists graduate, not all of whom find work in their specialty. <br>  There are problems with the effective use of IT-specialists and return on investments in IT in Russia, which so far leaves a lot of space for the provision of outsourcing services to the west and demonstrates the relative underestimation of specialists in the domestic market. <br>  <strong>Philip Guzenyuk: What approach, strategy, tools should an IT company use to successfully attract, retain and develop employees?</strong> <br>  <strong>Mikhail Zavileisky: The</strong> key point is honest and intensive communications to the labor market.  The company should strive to fulfill promises to specialists at all costs, respect them and demonstrate interest in cooperation.  The main channel of communications (especially for small and medium-sized companies) is social networks enhanced by communication on the Internet.  And any inconsistency and inconsistency in such networks causes an inadequately high level of negativity, which is usually high anyway - satisfied, most often, are silent ... <br>  The more attractive for your smaller number of potential employees your offer, the more time and effort you will have to spend on communication, but even the most perverse offer, set out honestly, will find its consumer. <br>  <strong>Philip Guzenyuk: What are the main difficulties in applying this approach?</strong> <br>  <strong>Mikhail Zavileisky: There are</strong> two obstacles - creative chaos in the head of entrepreneurs and managers, and their excessive pragmatism, most often ostentatious.  Both are common in Russia very widely and are a consequence of the general focus in the short term.  And then "50 to 50" - or those who have relied on the long-term perspective will win, or it is simply not necessary to retain and develop employees, and the easiest way is to attract money and promises. <br>  <strong>Philip Guzenyuk: What, in your opinion, is the adequate role of the CEO of an IT company in attracting, retaining and developing employees?</strong>  <strong>What should he focus on?</strong>  <strong>What is important to learn?</strong> <br>  <strong>Mikhail Zavileisky:</strong> People live in emotions, but they argue about themselves as rational beings (about engineers, this is true in the square).  Therefore, they want love, care, attention, and ask for money, money and money :).  That is why the CEO must develop emotional intelligence and pay close attention to internal communications. <br>  Everyone notices that companies are very similar to their managers, and if a manager wants clients to like the company, then within the company, with employees, you need to behave like clients. <br><br>  <a href="http://www.directorclub.ru/category/interview/">Other interviews on the Directors Club website</a> </div>
