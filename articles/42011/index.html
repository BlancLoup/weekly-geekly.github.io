  <section class="page js-page"><h1>New business model + new functionality: normal startup status</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Most recently, in an article about the <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/startup/41521/">presentation of startups, I</a> wrote that there are three business models: ‚Äúadvertising‚Äù, ‚Äúsubscription‚Äù, ‚Äútransactions‚Äù.  But then they are innovations to boldly go beyond the existing.  And the new <a href="http://www.comindwork.ru/">Comindwork</a> release comes out immediately with two important changes: in the payment method and in functionality.  This post is an example of how courage helps in business.  I want the post to be a source of inspiration for other people who start their projects.  Plus, pure joy and PR :)) <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  Payment method "by the month, as you consider necessary" </h4><br>  The usual business model for SaaS services is a usage fee, which looks like this.  Free base plan (and how else to show the goods face), and payment by subscription.  Or for additional functionality, or for the additional volume of the same service.  Payment is usually forward, that is, the service is always a "prepaid service." <br><br>  We decided that there is an even more honest and at the same time convenient form of payment.  Clients do not pay for the tools, but for the actual result.  What they were able to achieve with the help of the service. <br><br>  <b>Service is free.</b>  <b>Increasing efficiency is priceless.</b>

      (Comindwork as a service is a way to collaborate and manage projects online. That is, it is a medium of communication between participants of a company or a project, an environment for increasing efficiency.) <br><br>  Our customer offer is very simple.  It can be described by simply showing our feedback form: <br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://www.comindwork.ru/images/upgrade.png"></div><br><br>  In other words, we conclude a verbal agreement with users: ‚Äúwe do the maximum and we will do it,‚Äù and the user, in turn, is obliged to ‚Äúhonestly speak his opinion about the service and share the profits from increased efficiency in projects‚Äù. <br><br><h6>  The code name of such a payment model: ‚ÄúPreved, Radiohead‚Äù. </h6><br>  After all, it was they who a year ago, on October 10, posted their In Rainbows album online, with a proposal to pay as much as everyone considers necessary.  So we are dedicating the new Comindwork release to them. <br><br>  The inner content of this model: "Do what you must, and come what may."  We understand that we rely on the integrity of our users, and on the functionality of the system.  Own courage.  But I don‚Äôt want to make any other choice. <br><br>  The second innovation is functionality. <br><br><h4>  Emotional management </h4><br><br>  We believed that the main thing that our competitors lack now is semantics.  That Web 3.0 will be intelligent to ugliness and all of itself semantic.  But we are a small team, and it turned out to be difficult to develop such a complex topic before really useful use. <br><br>  After listening to themselves and the world around them, having read a dozen books (special thanks to Rolph Jensen's ‚ÄúDream Society‚Äù), they decided: the next generation of services is emotional.  Information becomes not as important as feelings, emotions. <br><br>  Why do many people communicate in LJ and Vkontakte more interesting than working? <br>  Because when work becomes non-living, non-social, non-with-people, the desire to work really disappears. <br><br>  It would seem, what do emotional services have to do with project management?  The most direct. <br>  Emotions - the most underrated information about the team.  Sharing emotions means increasing the presence and trust in the team, making the immersion in the context of the project faster. <br><br><h6>  Action = knowledge + feelings </h6><br>  In other words, feelings are the essence of motivation.  As a result, an ‚Äúemo-log‚Äù appeared in the system, that is, an emotional microblogging within the team. <br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://www.comindwork.ru/images/emolog.gif"></div><br><br>  I will not fully describe the functionality itself, it is not as important as the fact itself.  We did it.  :) They broke down and discussed a dozen approaches, talked with dozens of people, wrote some unimaginable number of lines of code. <br><br><h6>  ‚ÄúDo what you have to - and come what may‚Äù </h6><br>  PS I beg to comment.  I wonder what you think.  For any of the items. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/42011/">https://habr.com/ru/post/42011/</a></p>
