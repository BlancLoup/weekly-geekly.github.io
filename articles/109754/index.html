  <section class="page js-page"><h1>What users will not write to you in feedback</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  It happens that something happens on the site, the number of registrations has noticeably decreased, or the activity of users on the site has dropped to zero, but the programmer has ‚Äúeverything works‚Äù and he thinks that everything is fine.  I analyzed the problems we faced in two years on our project and made a small list of what users are unlikely to ever write to you. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  Site ‚Äúlies‚Äù </h4><br>  Yes, it happens that the site is lying, well, when you see it and correct it, but if you are a morning person, and the site ‚Äúlies down‚Äù at midnight from the influx of visitors, and you have a different time zone and you are sleeping for a long time, then users will not write because you  their site is not simply loaded and they will go to competitors. <br>  How to find out: <br>  1. put a free tracker on your site, for example <a href="http://host-tracker.com/">host-tracker.com</a> <br>  2. analyze server logs and boot charts (if any) <br><br><h4>  DNS issues </h4><br>  No one is perfect and your sysadmin too.  Perhaps your site (or one of its domains) has ceased to be resolved, or (worse), DNS servers have become out of sync and your primary DNS is working, and the secondary is not aware of such a domain. <br>  Once we had a site on one regional site for one provider because its DNS server scaled the response from the master, and on another provider it did not work because it cached the response from a non-working slave. <br>  How to find out: <br>  1. put a free tracker on your site, for example <a href="http://host-tracker.com/">host-tracker.com</a> <br>  2. write your domain checker if you have a lot of them <br><br><h4>  Counters or other javascript </h4><br>  Perhaps you once succumbed to the temptation and put yourself on the site counter users.  Or your friend wrote a small script to show the news and as a friend asked to put on your site and you agreed to it ... What could be wrong? <br>  1. The server giving the script can slow down and then the wrong script will slow down the loading of your entire page until the script loads. 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>
        <script>
          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      But maybe you have foreseen this trouble and wrote a small wrapper around the script, which will first load the page itself, and then insert counters into it?  Naive! <br>  2. The author of a script or counter can suddenly rewrite it, for example, to insert data, it will use document.write and then all your HTML will be replaced with its insertion. <br><br>  How to find out: <br>  1. disable AdBlock and other cuts for your website in your browser in order to see the website as your users see it. <br><br>  PS: taking this opportunity, I want to say hello to the developers of the Rambler Top-100 counter, which regularly cause problems. <br><br><h4>  Feedback does not work </h4><br>  Have you received error messages for a long time?  Think everything works perfectly?  Do not relax - maybe your feedback has broken down :) Yes, and it happens this week hasn't worked for us, for Yandex - a couple of months - no one is perfect.  So the absence of applications is a reason to think, because the user will not be written about the fact that feedback does not work, or about other errors. <br>  How to find out: <br>  1. Leave an alternative communication line (for example, specify email) <br>  2. Log errors that occur in your project and analyze them. <br><br><h4>  ‚ÄúThe instruction at address 0x432942 addressed the memory at address 0x00000004, the memory cannot be‚Äú read ‚Äùor an alternative environment </h4><br>  Here such message can meet your site of users of Internet Explorer.  And still styles can be rendered in such a way that links to help are not visible, or the necessary javascript does not work.  And in general, ‚Äúthe <a href="http://2010.404fest.ru/video/item-23/">money of IE users is the same as the money of Firefox or Opera users</a> ‚Äù Sergey Chikuyonok. <br>  How to find out: <br>  1. Test in other browsers, look at the site through the eyes of your users. <br>  2. Log errors that occur in your project and analyze them. <br><br><h4>  Other troubles (find out what is hidden) </h4><br>  Perhaps your users are not satisfied with something, but they cannot bring it to you for one reason or another.  But on the other hand, they can write about this in their blog, in the contact forum or on the local forum in the section ‚Äúthey are zadolbali‚Äù. <br>  How to find out: <br>  1. Sign up to mention your project via <a href="">Yandex</a> or <a href="http://www.google.ru/alerts">google</a> <br><br>  Colleagues, I will be grateful for your ways to identify errors and instructive stories from the life of you and your projects. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/109754/">https://habr.com/ru/post/109754/</a></p>
