In the past three months, we selected applicants for a grant of $ 25,000 among the authors of the most interesting technical projects.  Today we are ready to announce the winner: it was the project of the team led by Roman Zhukov, involving the development of a relatively inexpensive personal <a href="http://donetwork.lenovo.com/ru/project-detail_1570_Personal-3d-printer.html">3D-printer</a> . <br><br>  The participants of the Do Network competition needed not only to present an interesting idea for the development, but also to fulfill a number of requirements - to attract an audience, develop the necessary documentation and put together a team that would be able to proceed with the project in the future.  According to the <a href="http://donetwork.lenovo.com/ru/lenovo/how-it-works">rules of the</a> competition, out of all applications submitted at the beginning of this year, we, together with <a href="http://donetwork.lenovo.com/ru/mentors.html">mentors</a> - invited experts - selected ten finalists.  The winner of the top ten projects was determined by popular vote. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/114/6e6/c62/1146e6c620b84c5a89919a7c023baef9.jpg" align="right">  So, the winner was the project of a personal <a href="http://donetwork.lenovo.com/ru/project-detail_1570_Personal-3d-printer.html">3D-printer</a> .  The authors of the project do not intend to copy the existing development, and the main criteria for the future of the device steel - a reasonable price in comparison with existing commercial samples (up to $ 1,500 for a finished printer), as well as the use of domestic supplies.  Such a device can be serviced at home - it is supposed to develop replaceable cartridges with material from which the printer will be able to create volumetric models.  In other words, such a device will be no different from a regular home printer ‚Äî connected to a computer, installed a cartridge, and you can work.  Congratulations to Roman and his team on the victory!  We believe that you will succeed.

Within the framework of this project, it is planned to create a whole complex from a computer, controller and CNC machine to create our own research laboratory at home.  It is noteworthy that all the hardware components proposed for this project are already being manufactured in Russia.  The authors propose only to create on their basis a final product, including both hardware, software, and even <a href="http://www.mntc.ru/w/index.php/%25D0%2597%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B3%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B2%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B0%25D1%258F_%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D1%2586%25D0%25B0">a knowledge base</a> (based on the Wikipedia engine), which can become the basis for conducting experiments. <br><br>  My personal favorite is the <a href="http://donetwork.lenovo.com/ru/project-detail_2503_AR-Go-%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B3%25D0%25B0%25D1%2582%25D0%25BE%25D1%2580-%25D0%25B4%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BF%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BB%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B9-%25D1%2580%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BB%25D1%258C%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BE%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D0%25B8.html">AR-Go</a> project, developed by the team led by Yana Artisheva.  More about him, Jana herself has already told on Habr√© - in <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/DIY/136262/">this</a> material.  The advantage of this project is, of course, the availability of a working prototype of a portable computer and a project of an augmented reality system.  Over time, one of the most interesting projects of the Do Network participants can become quite an everyday reality - it is enough to supplement an ordinary smartphone with a compact head display and control system.  However, it sounds simple only in words, although in fact it is supposed to completely redo the approach to ‚Äúcommunication‚Äù with mobile computer devices.  This project is Yana and good.  Good luck! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/265/43c/e75/26543ce75eaed18df00e3f0a010b8a6c.jpg" align="left">  Service " <a href="http://donetwork.lenovo.com/ru/project-detail_1575_%25D0%259F%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B4%25D0%25BE%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B6%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B8.html">Planners</a> " offers to learn from Russia the experience of residents of other countries to reduce traffic jams and save on gasoline.  If your housemate travels to work in the same area as you, then there is an opportunity to unite and drive a car (in turn).  If you can find another 1-2 people, then the savings are decent.  To implement the carpool principle, which is very popular in the USA, in accordance with modern realities, it is proposed to create an application for mobile devices (for Android and iOS) in which you indicate your travel route and are looking for colleagues in your area. <br><br>  Ten DoA Network finalist projects will receive Lenovo computers as prizes - those models that were listed on the project page as necessary devices for further work.  All the contest finalists can be viewed on <a href="http://donetwork.lenovo.com/ru/projects.html">this</a> page. <br><br>  Simultaneously with the Russian competition, similar projects were implemented by us in two other countries - India and Indonesia.  There, too, there are very interesting developments, for example, the Indian <a href="http://donetwork.lenovo.com/in/project-detail_1519_CAR-COM.html">project of a</a> peer-to-peer network of communication between cars on the roads, which also provides for interaction with traffic lights for a more competent traffic organization. <br><br>  Congratulations again to the winners and finalists of the competition.  The project turned out to be very interesting and useful for us at Lenovo, and we are pleased to announce that it will be continued in the future, but with new themes for the design tasks. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/139205/">https://habr.com/ru/post/139205/</a></p>
