We will not go into conspiracy theories, but think about one thing.  Most likely, Bitcoin was created with the money of capitalists, a team of highly skilled programmers and serious mathematicians, in particular, from computer science, of which there are not so many in the world.  With the money of the capitalists, he advanced.  For its advancement, many have used it in the dark, it is like a wonderful ‚Äúdraining‚Äù of photos of the new iPhone or ‚Äúspy‚Äù shooting of an unreleased machine. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>

      You can often hear that Bitcoin itself is not anonymous, it is believed that it was not created with the goal of completely anonymizing the user.  But, exactly, it was created for the inevitability of transactions and the simplicity of their conduct.  <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/whoer/blog/276382/">In the previous article</a> I said that it is extremely difficult to withdraw money from decent European banks to other non-European countries. <br><br>  <b>How to use Bitcoin anonymously for sending payments?</b> <br><br>  First, do not install the Bitcoin wallet on your machine, it is better to install it on a separate server in a virtual environment. <br>  Secondly, it must be understood that the Bitcoin wallet does not fit the place where the funds are kept. <br>  Thirdly, of course, you can not run a Bitcoin wallet to the network directly, only via VPN or TOR.  The scheme where you are&gt; vpn&gt; rdp dedicated + virtual machine + bitcoin&gt; vpn / tor is a reasonable solution for operating bitcoins inside the system itself.  As long as money does not go beyond the system, they will be anonymous, and their traceability will not pose any threat. <br><br>  <b>How to anonymously input and output bitcoin?</b> <br><br>  This is the most difficult question, it is precisely at this moment that de-anonymization occurs. <br><br>  1) As long as your amounts do not exceed $ 3000-5000 per month, you can order any anonymous bank card without confirming your identity, <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/hashflare/blog/275740/">here‚Äôs an article with an overview of such services</a> .  Technically, you can even order a dozen or a hundred of such cards and withdraw money in ATM.  But in practice, this will be inconvenient for amounts larger than those indicated. <br><br>  2) For larger amounts, you can use the services of exchanges, many of them still do not require identity verification.  You will only have to anonymously enter or withdraw another e-currency for which Bitcoin will be exchanged, which is also realizable through real exchange points. <br><br>  3) There are services and people who need to regularly pay invoices for Swift in one country, and they have cash in your city.  Technically, it looks like this: make money on the stock exchange, change it into dollars, request withdrawal to the bank account you specified.  In this case, not all exchanges are equally useful, the US usually usually requires account verification and can request data from a correspondent, but there are others.  Try it. <br><br>  4) Electronic currency exchangers.  The network has quite a few good exchangers with decent stocks that change one e-currency to another.  You, as in paragraph 2, will need to establish contact with those who can anonymously display / enter, more popular e-currency. <br><br>  Here it is important to understand that in the case of technical anonymity you can achieve it at a level close to the ideal.  But at the level of finance, in addition to the problems with anonymity itself, there are also risk issues.  Less anonymity - lower risks, higher anonymity - higher risks, because extra counterparties are added and the whole construction becomes more complicated. <br><br>  For example, such a scheme for working with bitcoins is quite suitable for someone.  Technically, everything is as stated above, and then a foreign company is opened for a trustee, an account on the stock exchange is registered for it, which is replenished through mixers or through conversion into DASH, and then it is converted back into Bitcoins.  After that, the money from the stock exchange falls to the account of a foreign company, which officially gets them into the desired country to the right legal or natural person.  This design is not perfect or just good (in terms of anonymity), but it is not a high risk, as in paragraphs 3 and 4. <br><br>  <b>And why is all this necessary?</b> <br><br>  The answer to this question smoothly flows into the discussion of what is happening with us.  The fact is that all or almost all are willing to pay reasonable taxes and take sane statements.  So why almost all, even a very large IT business, has an offshore structure?  Tax savings are taking place, but this is not the main thing, it‚Äôs still the convenience of doing business, the stability of the business and the low probability of losing it with a pen of tyrants' pen ... We are not talking about large and super large companies, and so on trivia.  Since 2011, a criminal clause has been imposed for the creation of an online casino, and from 2015 a tightening has also begun.  Imagine you worked for 5-10 years absolutely legally, developed the project and achieved a certain success, and one morning you woke up as a criminal.  Here's the article (https://habrahabr.ru/post/284598/) What do you need to do?  Throw it in the trash, go, sell? <br><br>  Pay attention to ‚Äúwithdrawing money through offshore companies‚Äù.  Who and how withdraws money is his own business.  The state, in theory, should only care whether he paid the tax as a physicist, un or through dividends.  Because the activity is not conducted on servers in Russia, on the territory of Russia, therefore he is not obliged to pay any taxes on profits, but only as a resident of his country and this is absolutely by law.  More than. <br><br>  I don‚Äôt know how real the probability is that a criminal will wake up tomorrow for using Bitcoins, as well as creating various anonymizers and whether there‚Äôs enough sense not to do stupid things.  Just be ready. <br><br>  <b>We continue.</b> <br><br>  Suppose you are working on a contract or just a freelancer on a foreign exchange, or you have an account in some trading office abroad.  Suppose you have earned $ 10,000 and want to pay a tax of 6% on them as an IP or 13% as an individual, even if 13% as a shareholder on dividends.  From the point of view of the state, it should look like this - a person somewhere, earned something and is ready to give 6-13%, to show the paper where it came from.  Do you think so?  Salmon sailed there.  A few years ago, it was possible to bring a contract or contact to the bank, where something was due to you from abroad, now, in most banks, you will be tormented and studied under a microscope ... Well, suddenly, the State Department sent you ‚Äúten "To overthrow the government.  By the standards of common sense, these are not just pennies, but super pennies that go to the good of the country, from which the tax is paid.  However, I don‚Äôt know by what standards and why currency control is bothering you. <br><br>  The most ridiculous thing is, in which the powerful of the world have a staff of lawyers, boughs, schemes, they take here with tens of millions, but you will be interested in banks for the top ten.  Like a small-medium-sized business built on the network, it cannot exist within the framework of a state that makes up the brain for several thousand currency transfers and forces them to make reports.  This is one of the main reasons why almost the entire Russian IT business has an offshore structure. <br><br>  Bitcoins, which appeared not just like that, but as a response to all this global financial orgy.  You remember, on the one hand, there is Switzerland, into which you can only enter, on the other hand, there is Russia, into which you can bring and endure a whole staff of international lawyers, well, of course if you are not ready to devote your life to banalism about translations. <br><br>  I don‚Äôt know how now (everything changes there), but in Ukraine at one time there was a simple and understandable law from the FTS for IT, the essence of which is that you declare a certain amount of income, pay tax, and if your expenses do not correspond to income, you may ask.  The same, in my opinion, is now in Belarus. <br><br>  At the moment, Bitcoins in Russia have gone to the block, like other cryptocurrencies and are in the border state.  It seems as you can, but you can not arrange.  So the people are wise, use ‚Äúpads‚Äù of the type of exchanges and declare transfers from there as a profit on IP at 6%.  A couple of months with the conclusion of the BMP, some problems have arisen, you know, probably, that they exist, but you probably don‚Äôt know their reason.  It turned out that the eureka poured about 1 billion rubles a day through the lured bank into the black one.  1 billion!  Charles!  Well, as usual, the boyars fight at lackeys forelocks crack. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/394851/">https://habr.com/ru/post/394851/</a></p>
