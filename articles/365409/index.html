A large apparatus, in which years of work have been invested, filled with advanced scientific instruments, enters the atmosphere of a distant planet, and it is not a fact that it will respond from the surface.  There are enough precedents - the probes were broken, destroyed in the atmosphere or were silent for an unknown reason.  And the whole mission was wasted.  Even if the landing was successful, only one device could not be in several places at the same time, and one had to choose between many potentially interesting places.  Also the place had to be safe - the risk of losing the probe outweighed the scientific interest.  But now dozens of micro and nano-satellites are flying in Earth orbit, what if we apply this idea to interplanetary stations? <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  First success </h4><br>  The first mission, where several small ones flew with a large probe, was <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259F%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580-%25D0%2592%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0-2">Pioneer Venus-2</a> , launched in 1978.  A large apparatus sat near the equator, and three small dispersed to the sides.  One sat at ~ 60 ¬∞ north latitude, the second - far away on the night side, and the third - on the daytime.  The design of the apparatus was simple: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/52a/b96/170/52ab961701bf4b11ab41f66a69265d7c.gif"><br>  <i>1 is an antenna, 2 is a thermometer, 3 is thermal protection, 4 is an airtight container with batteries and electronics, 5 is a <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259D%25D0%25B5%25D1%2584%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BB%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B5%25D1%2582%25D1%2580">nephelometer</a> , 6 is a radiometer.</i>

      Small devices did not even have a parachute.  The ‚Äúday‚Äù apparatus exceeded the expectations of the designers, withstood the impact on the surface and transmitted data for another hour. <br><br><h4>  Losing streak </h4><br>  The next station, which bore the "cage" of the apparatuses, was the super-ambitious <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259C%25D0%25B0%25D1%2580%25D1%2581-96">Mars-96</a> .  The heaviest Martian station, besides the orbital module, carried two landing stations and two penetrators: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/164/82f/764/16482f7648dd4d298fc5746536d60641.jpg"><br><br>  The landing stations in the inflatable cushioning casing were to parachute, and the penetrators were to stabilize with an inflatable conical braking device and to be stuck in Mars at a speed of ~ 80 m / s.  After the impact, the front part had to dive for 5-6 meters, unwinding the wires behind it, and transmit the data to the tail part, which remained on the surface. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/7f1/46b/1f9/7f146b1f98054720a719ad585f83c136.jpg"><br><br>  Each penetrator carried 10 scientific instruments and promised to collect unique data about Mars.  Until now, no apparatus has plunged so deeply into Mars.  It is a pity that the station did not go to Mars from Earth's orbit and burned down in the atmosphere several hours later. <br><br>  In the 1990s, NASA launched the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Millennium_Program">‚ÄúNew Millennium‚Äù program</a> , in which two small <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_Space_2">Deep Space 2</a> probes went to Mars with the <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mars_Polar_Lander">Mars Polar Lander</a> .  They were placed in a heat shield aero shell: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/572/89d/c80/57289dc8084d46c7b89be226f30aa797.jpg"><br><br>  Separated shortly before landing, they had to fall without a parachute, break the shell when struck and immerse the front part half a meter to Mars: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a81/50c/7b5/a8150c7b595e49e58f8ba5df9bd5c4de.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/9a1/509/945/9a1509945ddb49789a9d066498d6a57d.gif"><br><br>  On the third of December, 1999, the vehicles plunged into the atmosphere of Mars, but neither the large Mars Polar Lander, nor the small penetrators did not come into communication.  The cause of the accident of all devices remained unknown. <br><br><h4>  Branch </h4><br>  In the zero years, articles were written about the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãsmall vehicles, but the real interplanetary stations carried a maximum of one device for descending to <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2593%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BE_%2528%25D0%25BA%25D0%25BE%25D1%2581%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B8%25D1%2587%25D0%25B5%25D1%2581%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B9_%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BF%25D0%25BF%25D0%25B0%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0%25D1%2582%2529">Jupiter</a> , <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2591%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B3%25D0%25BB%25D1%258C-2">Mars</a> or <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259A%25D0%25B0%25D1%2581%25D1%2581%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8-%25D0%2593%25D1%258E%25D0%25B9%25D0%25B3%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD%25D1%2581">Titan</a> .  But the concept of a simple apparatus, which is able to withstand the entrance to the atmosphere, received a curious offshoot.  Information about the passage of the apparatus of the dense layers of the atmosphere offered to record in the "black box", which would survive the destruction of the main unit and would be able to transmit data for further investigation.  Thus was born the project <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reentry_Breakup_Recorder">Reentry Breakup Recorder</a> (REBR), which has already recorded the destruction of the ISS supply cargo ships in dense layers of the atmosphere and successfully transmitted data. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/fb2/1a2/9ad/fb21a29ad67948808e5d94978a9c9d1c.jpg"><br>  <i>Scheme of the apparatus.</i>  <i>Nothing complicated - batteries, data fixing device and transmitter</i> <br><br>  On the basis of REBR technologies, the Pico Re-Entry Probe project, a very cheap universal device capable of withstanding braking in dense layers of the atmosphere and transmitting data, is proposed.  For example, it is proposed to set the associated load to the satellites: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/2e8/39a/2fe/2e839a2fed644f458075379f4916a590.jpg"><br>  <i>The satellite carrier's orbit gradually degrades, it burns in the atmosphere, and PREP transmits data directly to the communication satellite, without the need for search and selection</i> <br><br>  With the help of PREP, it is proposed to obtain data on the behavior of subsystems and spacecraft materials, or, for example, to conduct cheap atmospheric studies. <br><br><h4>  New Hope </h4><br>  In recent years, the number of ideas for the use of micro, nano and pico probes has increased dramatically.  In the summer of last year, <a href="http://geektimes.ru/post/227249/">they wrote</a> about chipset chip probes, which are proposed to be dropped on Jupiter‚Äôs satellite Europe. <br>  In the spring of this year, the University of Toronto offered <a href="http://www.space.com/28584-jupiter-microprobes-smara-mission-concept.html">to dump a swarm of vehicles</a> into the atmosphere of Jupiter (project SMARA): <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/0c4/838/2eb/0c48382eb74a41cd9de4e9740cef5e53.jpg"><br><br>  And in March, the nonprofit organization Planetary Science Institute proposed <a href="https://www.psi.edu/news/marsdrop">the MARSDROP project</a> : <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/088/745/ef4/088745ef408a4c0e9aa1026bb0b4bfcc.jpg"><br><br>  It is proposed to place a landing parachute with a guided parachute-wing in the mastered aerial shell.  This combination is expected to provide an accurate landing in an interesting from the point of view of science section of the surface of Mars - a fresh crater, canyon, area of ‚Äã‚Äãvolcanic activity, glacier.  The developers assume that such a probe will be able to fly up to 10 km in the atmosphere of Mars, compensating for the inevitable inaccuracy of braking in the atmosphere, and deliver a 1-kg vehicle exactly to the target.  It is expected that two MARSDROP vehicles, taken by passing cargo to the main mission, will increase its value by no more than 5%. <br><br><h4>  Analysis </h4><br>  The idea of ‚Äã‚Äãusing a swarm of probes to explore planets has the following advantages and disadvantages: <br><br>  Advantages: <br><ul><li>  New level of scientific data collection.  The grid of devices is able to give a spatial representation of climate, weather or geological data.  One device basically can not do this. </li><li>  The large integral reliability of missions ‚Äî the failure of one apparatus is not fatal. </li><li>  The opportunity to take a greater risk - you can reset several vehicles in the valley of Mariner, on Olympus or on the plain of Hellas. </li><li>  More scientific data.  An occasional miss while landing a Chinese lunar rover revealed new information about the geology of the moon.  And if hundreds of vehicles landed? </li></ul><br><br>  Disadvantages: <br><ul><li>  Limiting the mass of one apparatus means that it is impossible to put complex and large scientific instruments on it.  Also, the devices are unlikely to be able to move or exist for years. </li><li>  Small size dictates a small power - the orbital repeater becomes mandatory.  Also, to the repeater increases the requirements for data transmission. </li></ul><br><br>  In my opinion, the advantages obviously outweigh, I hope, in the near future, swarms of probes will complement the large complex devices we are used to. <br><br><h4>  List of used sources </h4><br>  In addition to the sources indicated in the text, the following were used: <br><ul><li>  <a href="https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/docs/P3.4%2520Howard%2520Minitiaruization%2520of%2520Probes.pdf">Austin R.
