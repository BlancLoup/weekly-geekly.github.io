  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Unclassified</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  From time to time, news about the social network ‚ÄúSecret‚Äù jumped on the web.  Some people liked the idea, someone thought that the implementation was still too crude (I recall the post about vulnerability, thanks to which it was possible to calculate the hidden author of the message - in my opinion, they wrote about Secret). <br><br>  And today, lenta.ru <a href="http://lenta.ru/news/2015/04/30/secretend/"><u>wrote</u></a> that the service is closing.  There is a <a href="https://medium.com/secret-den/sunset-bc18450478d5"><u>link</u></a> to the blog entry of the founding father. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">A little google-translate for those who can not English:</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  After much thought and consultation with the board, I decided to close the project ‚ÄúSecret‚Äù. <br><br>  It was the most difficult decision in my life, and it upset me very much.  Unfortunately, ‚ÄúSecret‚Äù was not at all what I saw when I created the company.  And it seems to me that closing the service is the only right decision for me, our investors and the team.

      I am very proud of our team that created a product that attracted more than 15 million users and expanded the boundaries of traditional social networks.  I believe in honest, open communication, creative expression - and anonymity helps a lot to achieve these goals.  But it looks like a dangerous double-edged sword, which requires extremely respectful and careful handling.  I look forward to what others will do in this area over time. <br><br>  I will spend the next few weeks gently taking the Secret from the stage.  Most of our team is already distributed in other interesting areas, and now almost all of my time I will devote to finding suitable classes for the main project specialists.  We raised one of the most talented teams with whom I had the honor of working.  I am sure that all our employees will continue their brilliant career in those companies that are lucky to hire them. <br><br>  A lot of investment was made in ‚ÄúSecret‚Äù, but our investors sponsored the team and the product, and it seems to me more correct to return the money than trying to restart the project.  Development is unthinkable without failures, and I believe that you need to be able to quickly admit your defeat and go forward in order to make only new, other mistakes. <br><br>  In time, I plan to publish an ‚Äúobituary‚Äù so that others can learn from our mistakes, the problems we have been facing, and the experience we have gained in these incredible 16 months. <br><br>  Thanks to everyone who supported us last year.  It was a truly incredible journey. <br><br>  / P.  David Byttow / <br><br>  Ps.
