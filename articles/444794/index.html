      Well, on this so necessary on Habr√© the review of a cat is finished.  And under the cut, we briefly tell you about the Tractive. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <a href="https://medgadgets.ru/shop/treker-dlja-otslezhivanija-domashnih-pitomcev-the-tractive-gps-pet-tracking-device.html%3Futm_source%3Dhabr%26utm_medium%3Dtractive%26utm_campaign%3Dtractive">Tractive</a> is a tracking device whose main audience are pet owners.  He entered the market just in parallel with the <a href="https://www.novayagazeta.ru/news/2018/12/25/147921-verhovnyy-sud-razreshil-ispolzovat-shpionskuyu-tehniku-dlya-obespecheniya-lichnoy-bezopasnosti-i-slezhki-za-domashnimi-zhivotnymi">statements of the Supreme Court</a> about concessions in relation to espionage equipment for personal use, but he also received a notification from the FSB.  From this point of view, it is safe for the owners of four-legged friends. <br><br>  Like any gadget, Tractive has its own characteristics, advantages and oddities, which I would like to briefly say, especially since just around the corner is the summer-away season, when many choose to go outside the apartments with their pets. <br><br>  <b>How does it work</b> <br><br>  Tractive has a built-in GPS sensor that works <a href="https://help.tractive.com/hc/en-us/articles/207925125-Where-does-the-Tractive-GPS-work-Check-your-in-country-Tractive-coverage-">almost worldwide</a> , having agreements with mobile operators.  This is a universal solution to not bother with SIM cards, do not open the device to replace them, breaking the seal.  As a partner in Russia - the company MTS. <br><br>  This decision seems to be justified: firstly, the integrity of the structure is indeed preserved, and the "Tractive" has protection against water, which is correct!  Plus, it saves you from thinking about which operator to choose, and what to do if you leave, and what about roaming, etc. <br><br>  Like any GPS tracker, Tractive provides precise control only in open space.  In conditions with a weak signal, there will be an error in the room.  Another thing is that it is necessary to control the animal in the apartment?  - The question.  But if the cat went off and huddled somewhere in the attic, then it would be possible to understand this only approximately.  As soon as he runs out into the street, everything will resume again with high accuracy. <br><br>  <b>Pay for Tractive</b> <br><br>  For the device there are several tariff plans: <br><br><ul><li>  Base </li><li>  Premium </li><li>  Premium + device insurance </li></ul><br>  <b>The base tariff</b> Tractive is optimal for those who are geographically tied to one country and do not travel with animals systematically.  This tariff offers several functions, including ‚Äúreal-time‚Äù tracking, but, for example, does not store the history of movements. <br><br>  It will be enough just to search for Dranik: he looked where he, if necessary, shook the nearby box with the Viskas and forgot. <br><br>  <b>The Premium Tariff</b> provides access to all of the functionality of the device with coverage in all partner countries, preserving history and some other, less useful features. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/1k/ka/no/1kkanofs01ro8tmi-vorcnhbtzq.png"><br><br>  <b>Premium Care</b> - functionally duplicates the previous tariff, but also includes ‚Äúinsurance‚Äù for the device in case of a breakdown / loss. <br><br>  <b>Cost of subscription for the year:</b> <br><br><ul><li>  Basic: 3499 rubles </li><li>  Premium: 4199 rubles </li></ul><br>  Subscribe immediately for a year or two.  But the important difference from the Basic tariff from the Premium is a cunning and unobvious ‚Äúlafhak‚Äù with a monthly subscription - in the version ‚Äúfor one country‚Äù there is such an opportunity, even if it is hidden. <br><br>  The fact is that Tractive can be activated both through the mobile application and <a href="https://my.tractive.com/">on the website</a> .  So, to activate the monthly tariff plan for 349 rubles, you need to start the activation process <b>on the site</b> .  Then, having reached the tariff plan selection (picture above), click ‚ÄúNEXT‚Äù. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/91/zg/jk/91zgjk2gugk1yas1ldkbseyiljg.png"><br><br>  Where except for two (a year and two) options there will be another barely noticeable link ‚Äúmore options‚Äù.  Clicking on it, you get another option - a subscription for a month. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/kl/pf/pj/klpfpjbzcjganzg3cbkmhca0nui.png"><br><br>  It is clear, of course, why it was done this way, but it looks at least tricky ... <br><br>  <b>Mobile app or website?</b> <br><br>  By itself, the principle of the tracker is clear and uncomplicated: it does not seem to work in tandem with the devices, but works "in tandem with the satellite." <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/0i/7a/yu/0i7ayuitsdem4zmvrel1ljhqm0m.gif"><br><br>  Therefore, by and large, there is no difference where to look at the data about it.  There are minor differences between the site and the application, but the basic tracking functions work the same way there and there.  The only thing worth saying is that the Tractive application is translated into Russian, the site is not. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/5u/02/c3/5u02c3rzl-4_8qgrocuvw7amtxk.png"><br>  <i>Sample Mobile Application</i> <br><br>  The most popular functions are immediately displayed on the main screen: Live, Virtual Fence, Calendar. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/dy/xs/7s/dyxs7shidztix10du9mij2feuro.png"><br><br>  <b>The Live function</b> is real-time tracking.  Suitable, for example, in the city, owners of dogs who in poor visibility conditions let the animal off the leash. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/qq/_k/4j/qq_k4ji_j8pbajdkdpcmzwa2pxg.gif"><br><br>  <b>Virtual fence</b> - a sort of function to save battery, so as not to use real-time mode all the time, you can preset ‚Äúwalking zones‚Äù.  As soon as the pet leaves them, the owner will receive a notification. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/zi/u8/ul/ziu8ulei2lfzsrurozdcp6e-ebo.png"><br><br>  <b>Calendar</b> is a travel history (available at a premium rate). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/l1/v2/jz/l1v2jzqwjbawwugus6z1dx5ewxg.gif"><br><br>  <b>Some more basic settings</b> <br><br>  As you have noticed, firstly, you can change the map display: graphics / satellite.  You can also add clarifying settings: altitude / compass, clarify speed, to understand how quickly you lose sight of the animal and whether to panic. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/c_/_r/ms/c__rmspxcthumaltpxt_8weyaie.png"><br><br>  <b>Work with computer</b> <br><br>  In principle, the interface, albeit in English, is understandable: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/rh/jo/if/rhjoifxoag_zqcnrc_fuygcla14.png"><br><br>  Here, in the web version, you can save movements for viewing on third-party services, for example, in KML. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/o5/qu/gr/o5qugrhgyord0fwz5gfibb1akwa.png"><br><br>  To see how the cat travels around planet Earth: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ob/rm/ep/obrmepiszpzgae0riz7o1myqfaa.png"><br><br>  But in general, besides the fact that the web allows you to save in the basic version of the subscription, it does not carry value as such, of course, if you have a smartphone.  For people who for some reason do not have a smartphone, this, by the way, can be elderly relatives, but connected to the Internet, a computer is the only way to watch Barsiki or Murzik. <br><br>  <b>For which little animals Tractive is intended</b> <br><br>  We have a lot about cats, although Tractive does not have an unambiguous addressing as a ‚Äúcat tracker‚Äù.  The company itself on promotional materials draws different animals, including horses. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/lp/n5/c4/lpn5c44yxlyjvhevqmpxpzubrzi.jpeg"><br><br>  And in the FAQ section it answers questions from users that with Tractive all kinds of large and small four-legged people get along perfectly well.  In principle, the truth is: there are no restrictions on which the tracker would not fit, say, a cow or a goat. <br><br>  Cats in this particular case only favorably distinguish Tractive from the competition.  Some other trackers with similar functionality are rather cumbersome and heavy, while others are a ready-made collar, which really does not allow cats to wear similar gadgets.  Tractive is not heavy and still not huge, in any case, personal tests have shown that the cat quite quickly gets used to the tracker, and the gadget does not prevent it from either licking or moving. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/o1/9n/xs/o19nxsw0soqkfxg5av1heoa9ahw.jpeg"><br><br>  In this sense, this device has a competitive advantage.  And it is quite in demand, if you run through the same Instagram: <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Cats</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/gl/an/kr/glankrdzk1e-ain8thvnspksc2m.jpeg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/9t/z5/zj/9tz5zjhidx7adktwv9houhp7mfe.jpeg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/st/lb/q_/stlbq_jfzdx1c1rglqgxbsqtzcc.jpeg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/as/cr/gg/ascrggwgojztdsuqjqk9eb18dmu.jpeg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/tc/un/s5/tcuns5svsto3xyuhsioxscozwrm.jpeg"><br></div></div><br>  Why it still seems to us that this model is well suited for cats - Tractive has quite good autonomy.  GPS eats a great battery, and many trackers are pulling for a day, which is not entirely relevant if the cat can go away for a week. <br><br>  "Tractor" can work <b>up to 5 days</b> on one charge.  This contributes to: <br><br><ul><li> <b>Intelligent tracking mode</b> .  This is the basic format of work gadgets: <b>the user can not adjust the intervals</b> !  Tractive evaluates the mobility of the animal, and if it notices intensive movements, it ‚Äútracks‚Äù more often.  If an animal is less mobile, it ‚Äútracks‚Äù less often.  This significantly extends the battery life of the device. </li></ul><br><ul><li>  <b>Fence.</b>  Instead of tracking at a given interval, there is a virtual fence function.  Tracking, of course, is carried out, but again, in some mode, the owner of the animal understands where the beast is and whether it has exceeded the permissible limits of space. </li></ul><br>  <b>What Tractive looks like</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/a1/jr/ua/a1jrua_57gr5tfyiyzukynsse8g.jpeg"><br><br>  The device has a rectangular shape with smooth edges. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/4x/x3/ym/4xx3ymj87crsxr_o9wuy6cdf-eq.jpeg"><br><br>  On the front side of the diode indicator, it can act as a backlight in the dark and the on / off button of the gadget. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ag/42/4k/ag424kirztdlbcj1bbrcwh6jmnu.jpeg"><br><br>  The gadget is protected from water, so it is connected very worthily.  No connectors, extra holes here.  Following this logic, even holes for some Micro USB are not added.  Contacts for charging on the back side: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ds/o5/-z/dso5-z9yvc1vkqqujwsnsnwz_6y.jpeg"><br><br>  A tracker is charged with its special clip. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/_x/tr/xj/_xtrxjdxag1dvfab2jswdklxuq0.jpeg"><br><br>  <b>The entire kit includes:</b> <br><br><ul><li>  Tracker </li><li>  Two clips for fastening to the collar </li><li>  Charging cable </li><li>  Adapter with adapters </li></ul><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/7t/8f/rp/7t8frp3p_xvhjdbp0sylrrz7o40.jpeg"><br><br>  The tracker does not force the owner to change an already existing collar and serves as a ‚Äúsuperstructure‚Äù, which is quite practical and convenient.  Clips cling very tightly, and quite easily: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/w_/yw/2n/w_yw2nisqcgntklsologd3h4ew8.gif"><br><br>  They, as was shown, have a serrated on the inside: the tracker sits tightly in one place, does not dangle on the collar and does not slip. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/uj/ep/km/ujepkmkuqz1m6jin1zzlkha76-0.jpeg"><br><br>  <b>Total</b> <br><br>  The tracker has a subscription model, and it is quite flexible: in the base version, which is popular with most users, you can pay the monthly rate. <br><br>  There are no complicated settings: to connect the tracker and pay, you just need to enter the code from the box or from the back of the gadget, linking it to an account either on a computer or via a mobile application. <br><br>  Overall dimensions make Tractive universal for dogs of large and small breeds, for cats, as well as for other animals.  For owners of walking cats "Tract" can be the best solution in terms of autonomy. <br><br>  On the aesthetic side, you cannot praise him and you will not scold him: visually, he is quite simple.  But the absence of any beautiful, probably partly dictated by the need to make the tracker less vulnerable to the external environment and protected from moisture. <br><br>  By itself, the tracker is not heavy, has a secure attachment to the collar and will not strain the animal very much. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Tractive Cost</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  The device <a href="https://medgadgets.ru/shop/treker-dlja-otslezhivanija-domashnih-pitomcev-the-tractive-gps-pet-tracking-device.html%3Futm_source%3Dhabr%26utm_medium%3Dtractive%26utm_campaign%3Dtractive">costs 4990 rubles</a> .
