How could HP fly webOS or a ghostly chance for RIM and ...?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Now Apple is in obvious leaders in the tablet market.  And judging by the <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/iTablet/126646/">desires of Americans</a> and what I hear personally, in order to seriously push Apple you have to try hard. <br><br>  Who makes sense to do this?  The one who individually controls the market for their tablets.  It is in this situation that you can get the full benefit of the above method, such as Apple has now with the iPad.  What is the path and why it is not suitable for manufacturers of tablets on Android <br> <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/iTablet/126738/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/14ca696d/68de85f2/b9ee30dd/591b1973.jpg" alt="HP TouchPad by iSuppli"></a> <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>

    <h4>  Successful behavior patterns </h4><br>  One of the ways to become successful is to analyze the behavior strategies of successful people and, identifying key points, harmoniously integrate them into their activities.  It is also suitable for companies. <br><br>  Obviously, in order for the tablet to become as successful as the iPad you need to have <ul><li>  high-quality iron </li><li>  convenient and responsive operating system with excellent "user experience" </li><li>  a rich set of good applications, and easily accessible through its application store </li><li>  competitive value </li></ul>  The first 2 factors were already on the tablet HP TouchPad.  And judging by the same survey, the link to which is higher, the Americans like HP and its webOS.  Frankly, this OS is also very cute to me. <br><br><h4>  Blitzkrieg </h4><br>  A large number of users with a properly arranged application store = a large number of applications, which ultimately brings the manufacturer a very significant profit. <br>  So the task is clear - get a large number of users.  But how to do this for an almost unknown tablet? <br><br>  And here another successful model comes into play - a game console sales model. <br>  Sony and Microsoft from year to year sell consoles even lower than the cost of "hardware", in order to pay back all costs and get profit from selling games and now other content that is distributed through their own networks like Xbox LIVE, Marketplace and PlayStation Network , Store. <br><br>  Could Hewlett Packard blow up the market using this sales model? <br><br>  I think that even if they released the tablets at the cost of "iron", i.e.  at the price of stuffing and assembly, at a price of 300-350 dollars tablets they would explode most of the market in an explosive way. <br><br>  iSuppli counted the <a href="http://www.isuppli.com/Teardowns/News/Pages/HP-TouchPad-Carries-%24318-Bill-of-Materials.aspx">cost of the collected</a> HP TouchPad $ 306 for 16GB and $ 328 for the 32GB version.  With a significant increase in the size of orders, they could reduce the cost.  In addition, the cost decreases with time, as well as with the manufacturers of consoles, although they certainly get a greater effect from this, since the configuration of consoles does not change over the years. <br><br>  They could only be hindered by their possible sluggishness in terms of considering applications if it were.  As with them, this was not the case. <br><br>  And although at the beginning of the sale of the tablets themselves for the company would be unprofitable, they would create the very same WebOS ecosystem that they dreamed of both in HP and in the ranks of those whom it had already charmed. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/821b3492/ac743978/c34094e7/a6731d4c.jpg" alt="HP webOS family"><br><br>  And HP would receive dividends from these investments not only from sales of applications, but also from sales of smartphones and future versions of tablets.  In this case, could the descendants of the Palm Pre create a real alternative to the iPhone?  Unfortunately, we no longer recognize this. <br><br>  Now you understand why this model of sales is not suitable for manufacturers of Android tablets and smartphones?  They simply will not be able to profit from the sale of applications. <br><br>  As for RIM, they are the only ones who could go this bold way.  But for them this path is much harder from a financial point of view, because there is a huge gap between HP and RIM resources <ul><li>  HP capitalization - 126 billion dollars </li><li>  RIM capitalization - $ 14 billion </li></ul>  In addition, BlackBerry PlayBook tablets, like most Android tablets, do not yet have the same responsive work as WebOS and iOS.  Perhaps this is due to the fact that JAVA is used?  Although I think that the situation with the PlayBook may improve after the release of the BlackBerry Tablet OS NDK, which will allow developing applications in C / C ++. <br><br>  <b>UPD</b> The cost of games for gaming consoles is much higher than for applications for tablets, so it would not be possible to be profitable only on this model. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/126738/">https://habr.com/ru/post/126738/</a></p>
