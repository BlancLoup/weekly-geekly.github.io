Perhaps you can immediately select them from the text of letters and dialogues, and perhaps you are still a novice and want to find out which phrases you should pay attention to are most common.  In any case, this article will appeal to freelancers around the world. <a name="habracut"></a>  So let's get started. <br><br><h4>  I would easily do it myself, but ... </h4><br>  Really?  You really can do this work yourself, but for some reason you want to give this pleasure to someone else, and even for much less money?  Why?  You do not have time?  You do not like this kind of work?  Yes, some of the civilians can actually hire someone to do some of the work, but I guarantee you will not hear these words from any of them. <br><br>  <b>What it really means:</b> In life, I didn‚Äôt do anything of the kind, but I want to make a smart look and, I think, having made it, I will scare you so that you name the real cost of work and, well ... I want to do the whole work process for you so much as heavy as it will be possible at all - as long as it suits me.

    <h4>  If you help me out this time, then I will continue to work only with you. </h4><br>  I must say that freelancers hear this phrase most often.  It is necessary to be afraid of such clients because they act only in their own interests, yours are indifferent to them. <br><br>  <b>What it really means:</b> Well, I don‚Äôt have much money, and I don‚Äôt really know anyone, but I lie and say that I have money and customers, because I want to get something without paying anything.  Are you stupid enough to buy it?  And then I have nothing to eat. <br><br><h4>  This project will be perfect for your portfolio. </h4><br>  Wonderful phrase.  It means that a client is better than you yourself know what is best for you and your portfolio.  They are sure that the work that you will do for them will be so good that it will adorn your portfolio.  This is wrong for several reasons at once. <br><br>  Firstly, it is a sign that it is a client who thinks he knows ‚Äúhow best‚Äù.  Believe me, this does not end well.  Secondly, it means that a client is waiting for a job from you, which you want to decorate your portfolio with - a killer job, but he rarely has an appropriate budget allocated for it. <br><br>  <b>What it really means:</b> Hey, friend, I know you have a great portfolio, but I want you to crash into a keyboard in a bloody mess to make my work the best that you have ever done.  Oh, I mentioned that the budget will be somewhere half the size of what you usually take to work?  And this is normal, because this site will look great in your portfolio. <br><br><h4>  For a professional here work for an hour. </h4><br>  This is one of the most common phrases.  I think there is an unspoken rule according to which it should be written in T.Z.  or a letter to the developer to be sure that you will ensure the execution of work at the lowest cost. <br><br>  <b>What it really means:</b> I really don't know anything at all about the subject, but what I know is that I want the cost of the work to be minimal.  So I will convince you that this is a tiny project - even if you know better. <br><br><h4>  The budget is small, but I will help you unwind. </h4><br>  This is such a special phrase containing two at once.  They are usually said together, but do not be fooled if they say them separately: ‚ÄúThe budget is small‚Äù and ‚ÄúI will help you, but I will help with the promotion.‚Äù  And that phrase should be avoided at all costs. <br><br>  <b>What it really means:</b> I want you to do the work for me on the cheap and to achieve this I will say that <i>I have connections</i> and / or I <i>can provide a huge amount of hits on your site</i> . <br><br><h4>  What do you think? </h4><br>  Did we miss anything?  Write in the comments if you have met these phrases or you know those that I have not listed here - I know, there should be more of them. <br><br><h4>  Added by users of habr :) </h4><br><br><h5>  - The previous performer has disappeared, most of the work has already been done, little is left. </h5><br>  <a href="https://megamozg.ru/users/nifus/" class="user_link">nifus</a> <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/freelance/84491/">habrahabr.ru/blogs/freelance/84491/#comment_2520017</a> <br>  Unfortunately, it happens.  But, even if so, be careful.  You will most likely have to work with someone else‚Äôs code of unknown quality and it can be so bad that you have to rewrite everything from scratch.  And they will probably pay you exactly for the revision. <br><br><h5>  - Let us make a website for us, we will not pay you anything, but you will receive a percentage from our sales / services </h5><br>  <a href="https://megamozg.ru/users/inlanger/" class="user_link">inlanger</a> <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/freelance/84491/">habrahabr.ru/blogs/freelance/84491/#comment_2519961</a> <br>  I am probably a pessimist, but more than half of startups die before they are born.  And often - no fault of the developers.  Want to take a chance?  Sure? <br>  In addition, do not forget, the customer in case of failure does not lose anything (at least does not invest money in the development of the project).  And you are wasting your time.  Which should provide you with a salary that should cover your expenses.  You will have to eat, rent an apartment, pay for Internet services and hosting providers, and much more.  And there is no certainty that a startup will ‚Äúshoot‚Äù and that even then they will not try to deceive you. <br>  However, decide whether to take the risk - you. <br><br><h5>  - I need the same site as in your portfolio, you understand that this is a ready-made solution and should not cost much </h5><br>  <a href="https://megamozg.ru/users/dust/" class="user_link">dust</a> <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/freelance/84491/">habrahabr.ru/blogs/freelance/84491/#comment_2520069</a> <br>  The fact that the site will, of course, be completely different for the customer is not obvious.  Or he prefers to ignore it.  After all, to make a layout of a design, cut it and make it into an html template, turn it over into templates for CMS, simultaneously replacing all the text and adding a couple of three profitable features that distinguish the project by 1-2 MB of code is a trifle that should not take a lot of time does not require serious financial investments. <br>  Do not agree to "copy" projects.  In my humble opinion.  Even if we are talking about your own project, this results in problems.  Each project is unique and deserves its own exhaustive TZ.  and adequate functional payment options. <br><br><h5>  - Make me the same site as <a href="http://www.bla-bla-bla.xx/">www.bla-bla-bla.xx</a> <br>  - We need a habrakhabr clone, VKontakte, freelancer.ru, ebay.com ... </h5><br>  <a href="https://megamozg.ru/users/serg_smirnoff/" class="user_link">serg_smirnoff</a> <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/freelance/84491/">habrahabr.ru/blogs/freelance/84491/#comment_2522010</a> <br>  <a href="https://megamozg.ru/users/ins1ght/" class="user_link">Ins1ght</a> <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/freelance/84491/">habrahabr.ru/blogs/freelance/84491/#comment_2520431</a> <br>  Similar to the previous one.  Such a phrase, as a rule, means that the client will try to work without a technical task (which results in a headache) and pay significantly less than the project really costs.  After all, this is just a clone of the project, right?  In severe cases, quite funny terms are added to this. <br><br><h5>  - I perfectly imagine how our site should look like, you just need to bring my idea to life </h5><br>  <a href="https://megamozg.ru/users/a_amik/" class="user_link">a_amik</a> <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/freelance/84491/">habrahabr.ru/blogs/freelance/84491/#comment_2520165</a> <br>  Most likely you will be buried under a huge number of edits and search for style. <br><br><h5>  - You have 3 days to work, after you provide 3 conceptually different design sketches </h5><br>  <a href="https://megamozg.ru/users/a_amik/" class="user_link">a_amik</a> <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/freelance/84491/">habrahabr.ru/blogs/freelance/84491/#comment_2520165</a> <br>  The customer does not know what he wants (and / or an intermediary); an advance payment is usually not offered. <br><br><h5>  - TK is not, and will not, all the details ask and find out </h5><br>  <a href="https://megamozg.ru/users/a_amik/" class="user_link">a_amik</a> <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/freelance/84491/">habrahabr.ru/blogs/freelance/84491/#comment_2520165</a> <br>  Work with such a customer should be avoided at all costs.  Such a formulation means that there will be a huge number of revisions and improvements.  And you will have no way to prove that something is not included in the agreed budget.  The budget at the same time if it changes, then downward.  For delaying the deadlines that are not T.Z.  can not be predicted even with a certain tolerance. <br><br><h5>  - It should be like *** - this is logical. </h5><br>  <a href="https://megamozg.ru/users/ins1ght/" class="user_link">Ins1ght</a> <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/freelance/84491/">habrahabr.ru/blogs/freelance/84491/#comment_2520431</a> <br>  In projects there is nothing that falls under the category of "a priori".  Nothing "logical" and "self-evident."  Everything should be stipulated in T.Z.  approved by both parties. <br>  In practice, this means: I understand that initially there was no question about it, but I would like this chip to be and you would do it for free.  So I will try to convince you that you should have done it from the very beginning. <br>  Or, in the best case, it means that the client was hoping that you have telepathic abilities that will allow you to find out all the things that are ‚Äúself-evident‚Äù for the client. <br><br><h5>  - We need a simple website. </h5><br>  <a href="https://megamozg.ru/users/polosatyi/" class="user_link">Polosatyi</a> <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/freelance/84491/">habrahabr.ru/blogs/freelance/84491/#comment_2521814</a> <br>  As a rule, it means the same thing as "For a professional here, work for an hour." <br>  In fact, the customer seems to be hinting that it is necessary to bring down the price well, and the complexity of ‚Äúunpretentious‚Äù sites is not inferior to other orders. <br><br><h5>  - And here I was offered cheaper ... <br>  - But I have my own programmer - he said Bla Bla, but now he can‚Äôt bla Bla <br>  - I actually have a good friend who could make me a website for N-1 thousand rubles.  There will be everything, the site will be everywhere.  Just do not want to ask him, he is very busy ... </h5><br>  <a href="https://megamozg.ru/users/polosatyi/" class="user_link">Polosatyi</a> <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/freelance/84491/">habrahabr.ru/blogs/freelance/84491/#comment_2521814</a> <br>  <a href="https://megamozg.ru/users/dypa/" class="user_link">DYPA</a> <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/freelance/84491/">habrahabr.ru/blogs/freelance/84491/#comment_2520434</a> <br>  In fact, the customer does not focus on the cost of the site.  Yes, and he has no friend.  The reason is the same.  Maximum work for minimum money. <br>  Sometimes the client may have cheaper offers.  But you should always think, why are they cheaper?  Most likely, because of lower qualifications or experience of the developer who offers such rates.  In such cases, it is worth to look at his work, compare it with yours and explain to the client what the difference is. <br><br><h5>  - We are holding a kind of a developer competition, and we‚Äôll give you 2000 rubles for the idea, if we like yours, you will receive the entire order </h5><br>  <a href="https://megamozg.ru/users/kukalyakin/" class="user_link">Kukalyakin</a> <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/freelance/84491/">habrahabr.ru/blogs/freelance/84491/#comment_2521858</a> <br>  It should read as: We want to pay for one idea, and get 20, from different boobies. <br>  However, this approach is quite common, and some of those participating in the competition still receive the order.  Sometimes quite profitable.  Want to take a chance? <br><br><h4>  From translator </h4><br>  I wanted to translate, since I had heard all these phrases more than once and that made me smile. <br>  Translation was done during a short break in work.  He is not perfect.  If you want to correct me - I will only be glad. <br><br>  I hope that someone, just like me, will cause a smile, and will warn someone against taking up work for which you should not undertake. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/84491/">https://habr.com/ru/post/84491/</a></p>
