  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Klimenko: in the torrent trackers, you need to enter authorization through "public services"</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Advisor to the President of the Russian Federation German Klimenko shared his plans for regulating the Internet in <a href="http://izvestia.ru/news/608118">an interview</a> .  He told what issues he was considering and what he would report to Putin. <br><br>  Being with the son of the <a href="https://geektimes.ru/post/269364/">owner of the torrent tracker</a> , Herman is concerned about the problem of how to shift the responsibility for distributing pirated products from the torrent tracker to users.  To do this, you need to implement authorization: ‚ÄúThe most serious problem with the Internet is anonymity.  All tactfully silent.  If anyone opposes anonymity, they will be torn to pieces.  But the process of de-anonymization is underway, ‚Äùsaid Klimenko.  - A torrent tracker who wants to be legal should come to the site of public services and ask them to authorize users.  The main claim of the right holders is that it is impossible to identify the user, so they make claims to the site.  Therefore, the torrent tracker should tell the user: if you want to upload something, log in.  In this case, the responsibility will be borne by the user. " <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Elimination of anonymity will solve the problem not only with piracy, but also with comments on many sites: ‚ÄúFor example, a number of federal publications on their sites closed the possibility for users to leave comments on articles.  In the comments now a lot of mat, spam and everything else.  As soon as authorization through the site of public services is introduced, users will be more responsible in what they say.  In fact, this is salvation for the media, and not only.  I am now closely studying this opportunity and, probably, I will lobby it at the state level, ‚Äùsaid the counselor. <br><br>  In addition to combating anonymity on the Internet, Herman Klimenko will try to lobby for import substitution in software:

    <blockquote>  ‚ÄúAny economist will say that if we now had, like India, $ 60‚Äì70 billion in revenue from software exports, the rate would be around 45 rubles per dollar. <br><br>  The state today finances Microsoft with us instead of financing domestic developments on the basis of open source software.  As soon as the state starts financing domestic software developers, we will have additional demand for programmers.  They will physically have more work.  Suppose we cannot make Silicon Valley, someone wants to do Skolkovo by creating something similar.  But if there are no people, we cannot do anything like this.  We currently have no programmers.  And there must be an excess.  It can only be if the state starts from itself and its 22 thousand municipalities, starts to switch from Windows to domestic developments. ‚Äù </blockquote><br>  Finally, Klimenko spoke out against banning pornography: ‚ÄúI am not a lobbyist for porn, but it is not necessary to prohibit it, because it contributed to the growth of the Internet.  And I do not see anything bad in this, because otherwise we will turn into a sanctimonious country.  As under socialism, when a boob flashed on the screen - and we went in droves to this movie to the cinema.  We did not reach legalization, but also prohibitions, too.  This is a paradox here: we cannot resolve it, but we do not want to prohibit it either. ‚Äù </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/356012/">https://habr.com/ru/post/356012/</a></p>
