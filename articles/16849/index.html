  <section class="page js-page"><h1>iPhone, Android and developer expectations</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The birth of mobile platforms is always a significant event for the developer.  Indeed, new platforms, especially from such giants as Google or Apple, create new markets from nowhere ‚Äî and here we see long lines of iPhone buyers in the US (and more recently in Germany, and just yesterday, today in <a href="http://www.ixbt.com/news/apple/index.shtml%3F09/70/56">France</a> ) a snowball of information about the so-called gPhone, and also we are witnessing a violent consumer reaction to the recent presentation of the Android platform. <br>  The appearance of buyers in the new market automatically means the emergence of a software market for a new platform.  And this is exactly what most developers are interested in, as well as investors who understand the possible benefits of the first ascent. <br>  So what's the problem?  It would seem that customers are willing to part with their money, developers are anticipating new unexplored depths, but some unknown obstacles prevent projects from successfully starting and ending. <br><a name="habracut"></a>  Namely: <br>  1. <b>Apple iPhone</b> .  A very successful commercial product - its success is evident now.  But developing applications for iPhone is fraught with difficulties: <br><blockquote>  1.1.  There is currently no SDK for writing native applications. <br>  1.2.  Blocking phones for use in various cellular networks, lack of official deliveries. </blockquote><br>  These questions were born as soon as the iPhone went on sale.  The second point practically kills the market of software for the iPhone, focused on the CIS countries and Eastern Europe (and until recently the Western one), while the first point puts an end to the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãwriting applications for iPhone.  But it is worth paying tribute to the management of the company - they soberly (albeit late) appreciated the situation.  The result is the <a href="http://www.pcworld.com/article/id,138563-c,iphone/article.html">planned release of the SDK</a> in February next year, i.e.  you just need to <i>wait</i> .  You can also hope that the iPhone, walking through Europe, will ever get to the CIS countries - we will <i>wait</i> . <br>  2. <b>Google Android</b> .  It would seem that Google took into account all the errors Apple.  They start promoting their platform with the <a href="http://code.google.com/android/download.html">publication of the SDK</a> , start a <a href="http://code.google.com/android/adc.html">large-scale development contest,</a> and in every possible way contribute to the creation of new applications.  Developers are satisfied with the open Linux-based platform, future users are interested beyond measure, it would seem - an ideal development environment.  But Google (or rather, the <a href="http://www.openhandsetalliance.com/">Open Handset Alliance</a> ) miscalculated with the release of devices on the Android platform.  Indeed, according to Google assurances, devices on the new platform will appear only in the second half of 2008.  This is <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/globalbiz/content/nov2007/gb2007118_729949.htm%3Fchan%3Dtop%2Bnews_top%2Bnews%2Bindex_global%2Bbusiness">confirmed by</a> manufacturers. <br>  Of course, a good emulator is bundled with the SDK, but emulators are not sold in stores, and the emulator is unlikely to interest a potential customer.  Also, this emulator has several significant flaws that can block development.  For example, there is no possibility to make real calls, emulation of work in a cellular network is rather poor.  That is, everything also remains only to <i>wait for the</i> appearance of devices on sale. <br><br>  Thus, neither the one nor the other platform is finally ready for development, despite the fact that, for example, the iPhone has already appeared 5 months ago.  We can only wait and hope for improvements in this area. <br>  <font>I would be grateful for any information about the emulation of the cellular network on the Android emulator, as well as for any amendments and updates to the above</font> </div>
