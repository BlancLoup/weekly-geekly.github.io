It‚Äôs the 21st century, and we are still offered to buy CDs with music and movies (and where, I ask, will I put it in a netbook or tablet?), As well as books in paper form.

      Without a doubt, the fact that there is an opportunity to buy a hard copy of your favorite work is good, but often it is not in demand.  Now most have a phone with a built-in player and / or a separate mp3 player, a computer at home, sometimes not one, but not everywhere there is an opportunity to play that disc. <br><br>  But this is only the tip of the iceberg - sometimes it is simply unrealistic to purchase a book or disc of interest, since they are simply not available in the store.  It can be ordered online.  But first you need to find a store that delivers the goods to you, a cat to go through the quest with payment, and eventually wait, at best, for a week to get the desired drive or book.  It is not surprising that many people prefer to simply find interesting content on one of the torrent trackers or on the site and download it, especially since there is no need to pay.  But right-holders begin to complain, they say, the pirates are so bad, they didn‚Äôt let us earn money honestly, they spit everything, let us drop them, and force the users to pay for the potential opportunity to save. <br><br>  But this can not continue indefinitely.  And there is only one way out - right holders turn to face consumers, and the latter, in turn, show consciousness and pay for content consumed.  How to do it?  It is both easy and simple at the same time. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>  First you need to determine what the consumer wants, and he wants to have access to the content here and now.  I wanted to read the book, and I‚Äôm not looking among the many shops, which of them sells it, in which it is available, where the delivery conditions are better and so on, but I just go to the site, choose, pay, wait until it downloads, and I read.  So it‚Äôs with music, movies and more. <br><br>  Then I can argue that this is already there.  Yes, there is, but, firstly, you still have to look for where you can buy it, secondly, the content is often copy-protected, and I will not be able to listen to the latest album on the way to work because it can only be listened to on a PC .  We need a system in which content purchased once would be available on several user devices, and possibly not just one particular user. <br><br>  But what if you create a system in which the user will not only consume content, but also participate in its distribution and advertising?  Easy.  It is only necessary to use the current "enemies" of rights holders, namely file-sharing and social networks. <br><br>  It creates the basis of a system in which a user, having registered, gets access to the whole variety of content, registers his devices (computer, telephone / smartphone, laptop, tablet, etc.) on it, and having made a purchase once, gets access to the content on all of these devices.  Conveniently?  In my opinion, very, but that's not all. <br><br>  People live in groups: family, dorm roommates, friends.  We are constantly sharing information.  Sometimes we give friends to read a book, or listen to a new disc.  Why can't we do the same with purchased content?  ‚ÄúPaid for one copy, one and should use‚Äù the right holders will say, and they will be partly right, but only partly.  The system should be able to share content.  I can share with a friend a new disc after he listened, and he can let me read a book, or give it to me.  To organize it is quite simple, in the same system we celebrate our friends and relatives.  And if for the time of ‚Äúborrowing‚Äù a friend the content becomes unavailable for us, then within the same ‚Äúfamily‚Äù the content can move with much less restrictions - several people can read the same book at the same time. <br><br>  By the way, it is for organizing this movement of information and you can use file sharing.  At first, the content comes only from the servers of the system, but as the number of users / customers grows, new purchases are provided not only by the system, but also by the users, this saves on system capacity.  The most active participants in the exchange can accrue certain bonuses, be it discounts or content as a gift. <br><br>  Also, the user should be able to recommend something to friends.  If a book is recommended, then it is given the opportunity to read a passage or the first chapters, or two, with respect to music, it will be possible to listen to the song several times, after which it can be bought, while the content remains with the renowned person. <br><br>  Content protection is an important part of the system, and this can be achieved by coding it with a key consisting of two parts: the first is the code generated for each account;  the second is the code for each device.  Just copying the content from the device, we get a bunch of files that the player or the program for reading books cannot read - decoding takes place directly at the moment of reading / listening / viewing.  When sharing files, the content is also encoded and transmitted over a secure connection, and the user does not know what is being transmitted right now, which file is from his library.  This will ensure the safety of content from illegal copying. <br><br>  Separately, I would like to draw attention to the video.  Wait a few months for films to be on sale while they go to the cinema is a mockery of users.  The film should be available as soon as possible.  If the film is frank G, then it will not be watched anyway, but a good film will be watched - both at home and at the cinema. <br><br>  The idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthis system is very obvious, but the implementation will require investments in infrastructure.  Creating the same client part of the software.  The implementation of the simplest mechanism for sharing content, which would provide reliable protection against copying.  All the necessary technologies already exist, these are NFC, P2P, social networks and much more. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/113930/">https://habr.com/ru/post/113930/</a></p>
