  <section class="page js-page"><h1>User feedback is a great thing!</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The main task of the user <s>to sit in classmates</s> to do their job effectively.  The main task of the administrator is to help this in every way.  This can be done in a variety of ways (including, for example, blocking the above-mentioned resource), however, feedback has been and will be a great help in the work.  In no case should it be neglected. <br><br>  In small offices, everything is simple - to the admin hand at hand.  All the problems, troubles, minor bugs emerge almost immediately.  In large and geographically distributed networks, feedback begins to present some problem.  No, well, of course there is always the opportunity to call or write a letter, but.  Not every person firstly knows where, to whom and what to report and secondly, there is not always such a desire to communicate on unknown topics with an unknown person ‚Äúsomewhere out there‚Äù.  In addition, if all of a sudden, the majority of users with a computer are on ‚ÄúYou‚Äù, then there is every chance, even in the case of a phone call, to receive, instead of describing the problem, only muffled muttering. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  One of the measures designed to solve this problem is the use of error messages that are understandable to the common man with a form for communication with the administration.  Well, something like "Send an error report to Microsoft", although the degree of understandability of their messages suffers a little :) <br><br>  The essence is this: it is necessary that the message was easy to send and did not have to think.  It is important.  After all, it is much easier, for example, to poke a button on a website than to write an elaborate email.

    <h5>  How do we solve this problem </h5>  Our university provides all users access to the Internet through a proxy server.  Previously, almost any error message that was issued ended with a phone call with the universal wording "The Internet does not work, please come in."  As a result, all messages have been radically reworked. <br><br>  For example, the message that the server is not responding looks like this: <br> <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/foboss/2869948113/" title="Server not responding by foboss, on Flickr"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/576/77b/11d/57677b11dd422c454d7d5e83469f05c3.jpg" width="224" height="240" alt="Server is not responding"></a> <br><br>  And so, if someone wanted "strawberries": <br> <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/foboss/2869947773/" title="Access to the resource is denied by foboss, on Flickr"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/610/8fa/e8b/6108fae8b36659edf7ebb232fdc11383.jpg" width="232" height="240" alt="Access to the resource is denied"></a> <br><br>  There are two common features of these messages: clarity for the user and the form for communication.  Frankly, when we introduced this system, I did not expect any results from it, however, as it turned out, nothing happened.  Various kinds of messages began to pour on the technical support box on a regular basis, both stupid and not so.  Users reported problems with sites, improper operation of filters, sent simply suggestions about server operation, etc.  The system was so convenient that we supplied it with error messages on our sites: <br> <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/foboss/2870777760/" title="Error 404 by foboss, on Flickr"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c29/445/0e3/c294450e345ee46205bae51479880aca.jpg" width="231" height="240" alt="Error 404"></a> <br><br>  The result was again very, very positive. <br><br>  The last (and it was necessary to be the first!) That we did was the form of typos on the official website.  And now we regularly have letters indicating inaccuracies and blunders in articles.  Nobody sent these comments without the form, although the e-mail addresses for communication are listed on each page. <br><br>  As a result, having spent a minimum of efforts, we received a reliable and convenient tool that allows users to easily and easily report problems.  True, it does not do without Uralsk subscribers, but this, as they say, is a completely different story! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/40408/">https://habr.com/ru/post/40408/</a></p>
