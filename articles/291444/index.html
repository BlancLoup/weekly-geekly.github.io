Alexey Sheremetyev, co-founder of Planner 5D</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/961/76b/9ed/96176b9ede8244948265839cd2fd9ba7.jpg" align="left">  The heading <a href="http://megamozg.ru/search/%3Fq%3D%255B%25D1%2581%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B5%25D1%2582%25D1%258B%2520%25D0%25BE%25D1%2581%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B0%25D1%2582%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BB%25D1%258F%255D%26target_type%3Dposts">‚ÄúFounder‚Äôs Councils‚Äù is</a> again in business and we continue to acquaint the readers of Megamind with key employees and, most often, owners of the technology business. <br><br>  The today's hero of the rubric is Alexey Sheremetyev, who together with his partner created <a href="https://planner5d.com/ru/">the Planner 5D</a> service.  Alexey says that the service was invented ‚Äúby itself‚Äù in 2010, when both founders were confronted, each separately, with a housing issue.  Trying to find a decent solution, the guys became depressed - it simply was not on the market, so "I had to do everything myself."  Today Planner 5D is a service that allows anyone to create the layout and interior of any room, even without having the special skills of an engineer or architect. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <i>Short biography Alexey Sheremetyeva: 28 years old, originally from the Crimea, since 2003 he has been living in Moscow.</i>  <i>In college years with a friend tried to organize a design studio, successfully implemented several projects.</i>  <i>Later I went to study work in large companies: ABBYY, Oversan.</i>  <i>He was engaged in design, interfaces and management of Internet projects.</i>  <i>Alexey claims that it was this experience that helped him create a virtual room planner.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>A brief history of the development of the project Planner 5D:</i> <i><br></i> <ul><li>  2011 - investment from the Igor Matsanyuk Foundation, the beginning of development. </li><li>  2012 is the web version.  2013 is a mobile version. </li><li>  Today, Planner 5D is available on the web, on the desktop (OS X), iOS and Android.  Number of registered users: 3.5 million. </li><li>  In 2014, the team moved to Lithuania, opening a main office. </li></ul><br><h4>  Run as early as possible </h4><br><blockquote>  Many are trying to delay the launch of the project.  It seems that he is not ready yet, I want to finish, add, add functionality, etc.  Very many it has led to failure.  The project will never be completed.  There will always be something else to do.  But running faster, you will soon find out what users really need.  Often, what we think should be claimed by the user is not really so.  It is very important to understand it in time and reorganize in the right direction. </blockquote><br><h4>  Experiment more </h4><br><blockquote>  You have to try everything.  We had cases where a completely unexpected and seemingly hopeless option worked.  And much better and more effective than the most obvious.  The most insane, "stupid" ideas can make you a cashier. </blockquote><br><h4>  Focus </h4><br><blockquote>  But with these experiments, do not get carried away so as to "get lost."  In order not to get away from the main point.  If something does not go - throw.  Focus now on what works 100%.  To controversial and complex things will return later.  We, for example, lost a huge amount of time and money, being sprayed on several things at the same time, of which ‚Äúin theory‚Äù everyone should have worked. </blockquote><br><h4>  Look for opportunities </h4><br><blockquote>  Every event in the modern world, be it another crisis or the release of Apple Watch, is an open window of opportunity.  Constantly look around.  Almost from everything you can benefit for your business. </blockquote><br><h4>  All this, of course, is easier said than done, we broke the pile of firewood ourselves and stepped on all kinds of rakes.  And still in the beginning.  Good luck! </h4><br>  <i>Editorial note: if you have a desire to participate in the ‚ÄúFounder‚Äôs Tips‚Äù section, write to us at editor (at) megamozg.ru</i> </div>
