What makes it stand out? <br>  I think the answer (or at least one of the options) would be karma.  In the language of the community - "little writing". <br><br>  At the moment I am engaged in writing modules for Django, related specifically to the assessment and evaluation.  Faced with a problem, I realized that some kind of rationale was needed for the idea, and not just my ‚ÄúI want‚Äù, because if there is no rationale, there is no sense.  Principle, the test was Habr. <br><br>  Habr gives the opportunity to straight "shit in" or "plus" karma, which is the main drawback.  I will explain why.  Suppose a person has 5-10 fairly successful, popular topics that have simply impressive ratings.  One day, he creates a topic for him that goes against public opinion ... And he gets everything at once in his hare, because he pays for good for karma less than less for bad, and this is a pitiful human nature, which for some reason it is easier to make a mess than to encourage :) (in my experience, 6 out of 11 people who put a minus shit in karma. However, <a href="http://marazm.habrahabr.ru/blog/28815.html">I already wrote</a> about this. <br><a name="habracut"></a>

Due to the masses.  Any person, at least a little versed in one of the exact and relatively exact sciences, knows that the more accurate the results, the more experiments were conducted. <br><br>  Purely for general development.  There is a set of results of some experience (i.e., the same experience was performed several times): 3.5;  3.2;  3.3, which gives an average of 10/3.  Question: What will happen to each new experience?  That's right, accuracy will increase. <br><br>  So, if we consider each information unit (topic, comment) as an experience, we will get the most correct result.  Karma Habra in this case, nothing more than the adjustment of the results of the entire study on the result of a single experience, which, for subjective reasons, was chosen. <br><br>  Another example (I apologize for blasphemy, but I think everyone will understand it): A person does not have a leg, has he really ceased to be a man ??? <br><br>  In total, we obtained the most subjective assessment of the upper element in the hierarchy, when it would be more appropriate to derive it from the lower ones, giving on average a more accurate and objective result. <br><br>  Strange, isn't it? <br><br>  Cross Post: <a href="http://blog.retta-web.ru/2008/07/social_rating_system/">Corblog Web Studio Retta</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/29202/">https://habr.com/ru/post/29202/</a></p>
