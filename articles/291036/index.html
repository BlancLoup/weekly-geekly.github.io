      Conducting a stressful interview is stressful for HR, after all, not all recruiters can do this.  Eychar is obliged to develop an interview plan in advance, provide for all possible behaviors of the applicant and, most importantly, interpret them correctly. <br><br>  It happens that a specialist hurries to impress the applicant with the skill of conducting a stress interview and asks indecent and intrusive questions.  The applicant quickly "cuts through" the recruiter's intentions, and here it is important not to split.  Otherwise, you will touch a specialist, and he will not give you the green light. </h6><br><h6>  <b>Replica:</b> <br>  <i>Daria, the applicant for the position of office manager in "MIEL"</i> <br><br>  ‚ÄúIn the beginning, everything was as usual: I came and they gave me to fill in the questionnaire, and then they asked me to wait a little and in a few minutes they invited me to the office.  Pretty nice girl asked standard questions: ‚ÄúTell me more, why our company?‚Äù, ‚ÄúTell us about the university‚Äù ... After she quite insistently asked about the place of residence, it seemed to me even somehow tried to convince me that it was very difficult to go to Moscow work from the suburbs.  The dialogue was like this: <br><br>  - How can you get up so early and not get tired? <br>  - I studied in a Moscow school and got used to get up early and ride, for me it is normal ... <br>  - Maybe you should look for something closer to home? <br>  - It is extremely difficult in my city to find a well-paid job with a suitable schedule for me and the prospect of growth ... (I confess, I got used to the employers' wary attitude towards my place of residence). <br><br>  Then something happened that I didn‚Äôt expect, Euchar critically responded about my points, in her voice disdain: <br>  - Could you take off your glasses? <br>  ‚ÄúIf necessary, I can ...‚Äù <br>  ‚ÄúDaria, why do you wear them then, since you can take them off, is this a tribute to fashion?‚Äù <br>  - No, this is a necessity, I have a complex astigmatism ... <br>  - Are such serious problems with vision? <br>  - Well, that you!  I, of course, see without glasses, but doctors advise to wear them all the time, so that the vision does not fall! <br>  - Why don't you make lenses in the 21st century ?! <br><br>  Honestly, I was seriously embarrassed and suspected that the conversation was going in the wrong direction, but answered all questions calmly and consistently.  The girl, having listened to me, congratulated and said that she liked me and invited the immediate supervisor so that I could clarify all the nuances of interest to me. ‚Äù </h6><br><br><h4>  <font color="#e41825">// Where the legs grow</font> <br></h4><h6>  As a method, stress interviews were formed only in the middle of the last century.  And, as usual, in the depths of the military departments - to solve the problem of recruitment and verification of personnel.  The unexpected, tough or frankly rude behavior of the interviewer made it possible not only to quickly verify the candidate's stress tolerance, but also to test his abilities to show flexibility and ability to behave in unusual situations. <br><br>  Gradually, the scope of stress interviews expanded to a set of firefighters, police and military, and soon everyone wanted to adopt best practices for recruiting office workers.  Innovators were found in Europe and the USA.  The occasion itself dictated the need to change something.  So, at the end of the twentieth century, leading foreign countries actively transferred entire industries to the countries of Southeast Asia, where the main jobs were formed.  In cities, work has become objectively less, and the number of applicants has steadily increased.  Therefore, the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãapplying the stress interview method to limit job seekers in the civilian sector seemed justified and practically innovative.  A few decades later, the stress interview method came already in domestic practice. <br><br>  There is a legend about the visit of the famous Soviet composer Aram Khachaturian to Salvador Dali.  Khachaturian waited a long time for an appointment in the spacious hall under his own ‚ÄúSword Dance‚Äù, being touched by the artist‚Äôs hospitality.  Time passed, but the owner was in no hurry.  Suddenly, the door opened, and Salvador Dali rushed past the Soviet delegation.  According to different versions: dressed, no clothes, no clothes riding a horse.  Then came the majestic major domo and reported that "the audience is over."  So the famous composer fell victim to the stress-mystification of the genius artist. </h6><br><br><h5>  <font color="#e41825">// Who gets into the mousetrap</font> <br></h5><h6>  Stressful interviews are most often carried out with candidates for positions connected with constant communication with various people, and such work promises to be nervous and restless.  In the ‚Äúrisk group‚Äù - managers and their assistants, sales and customer service managers, advertising, insurance agents, journalists, office managers, and claims managers.  In these positions, the ability to control oneself and reasoning in critical situations is as valuable as professional skills and experience. </h6><br>  If you have managed to work as a personal assistant to an eccentric boss, then stress will become your shadow throughout the entire cooperation with him, and awkward questions will become the norm, starting with the first interview. <br><br>  <b>Replica:</b> <br>  <i>Marina, an applicant for the position of personal secretary of a famous political and public figure, one of the first multimillionaires in Russia:</i> <br><br><h6>  ‚ÄúThe decision to respond to an invitation to an interview was lightning fast!  High salary and an office with a view of the Kremlin bribed.  It looked like an assistant secretary: high tail, bright pink lips, stressed eyes, high heels ... A young man greets me, examines from head to toe and says: "You are so bright in vain ..." I did not attach any importance to his remark .  The interview began, the immediate superior came, asked to stand up and spin.  Felt like a horse show.  And then the questions went: ‚ÄúWho are the parents?‚Äù, ‚ÄúOrthodox?‚Äù, ‚ÄúWhy is the cream catholic?‚Äù After which several recommendations were given regarding my appearance ... ‚ÄúNo pants, perfumes, lipsticks, only skirts below the knee, black shoes, and you can go to work! ‚Äù- concluded the‚Äú boss ‚Äù.  Do I have to say that the strange interview seemed later on to be nothing!  Our professional relationship ended, when in an angry state for an unknown reason, the cause of which I was not exactly, I was once again launched into a laptop ... ‚Äù </h6><br><h4>  <font color="#e41825">// Win before the game starts.</font> <br></h4><h6>  By stress interviews need to be prepared before the start of the interview.  Specialist floor recruitment may ask you to wait a little in the lobby or at the reception, arguing the delay of urgent unforeseen deeds.  He himself will slowly walk with a cup of coffee, or gossip with a colleague in front of you.  The test of time can last from several minutes to an hour or more.  In no case do not show others your impatience - Eychar must see that it is difficult to ruffle you.  Also try not to remind him of your person - this will betray your impatience.  Take, for example, reading a book or watching your favorite series (always with headphones!) - let an expert see that you value your time and know how to use it. </h6><br>
<h4>  <font color="#e41825">// In the paws of a cat</font> <br></h4><h6>  After you have been invited to the office for an interview, be prepared to see there is not the most favorable environment for negotiations.  Yes, it is possible in the company of your dreams!  Stress interviews can take place in the back, in a narrow corridor or in an office kitchen.  In the meeting room it can be dark and unpleasant to smell, and the HR manager will shine a pocket flashlight at you, and just try to grimace!  In the end, be prepared that you will not be offered the notorious chair. <br><br>  Take it coolly.  Do not say that you are uncomfortable, but politely ask to change the conditions - open the window, turn on the main lighting, bring a chair. <br><br>  Get ready for non-standard questions from the doorway and the fact that, besides the recruiter or direct manager, you can meet all his colleagues who know the rules of the game and try to embarrass and knock you on the way to a successful interview. <br><br>  <b>Replica</b> <br>  <i>Nina, an applicant for an economist position at Fazer:</i> <br><br>  ‚ÄúAs soon as I entered the office for an interview, the head of the department immediately asked for the factorial value of zero.  I immediately got lost, and then everything went awry.  I admit, I did not prepare for this.  Muttered uncertainly: ‚ÄúOne.‚Äù  After that, the head continued to calmly continue to ask on the merits.  I did not have time to come to my senses when all the heads of departments, even an accountant, came to the office!  Being yesterday's student, I did not expect such attention to my person.  I was given a ‚Äúround table‚Äù and everyone had time to ask me a question.  After that, they gave me a case that had to be solved under their scrutiny.  It was very hard for me to concentrate, and all the time I thought that it was unprofessional to put pressure on the applicant.  Only later did I learn about the practice of stress interviews.  Consider that I did not pass the stress test. ‚Äù <br></h6><br><h4>  <font color="#e41825">// Think first and then talk!</font> <br></h4><h6>  When communicating with the interviewer, always keep calm and self-confidence, while not losing self-esteem.  In no case do not let emotions get out - any increase in voice, retaliatory rudeness or outbursts of anger can mean a failed interview.  Recruiters have plenty of ways to shake your balance.  Do not be surprised to hear provocative questions, for example, ‚ÄúWhat did your actions at your previous place of work lead to the collapse of the company?‚Äù Or ‚ÄúDo you consider yourself to be too arrogant?‚Äù Don't dwell on the unfriendlyness of your interlocutor, focus on the wording of your worthy answer and remember - you as a challenger are tested for endurance in working with potential provocatively-minded clients in controversial situations.  Try to give a reasonable answer that would be refuted by the statement of Eychara.  Do not be afraid to make small pauses to think over words and phrases - it is better to think for a few seconds more than to give a quick but absolutely unacceptable answer. <br><br>  An HR manager can portray a misunderstanding and ask the same question with the stubbornness of the Butt of a parrot, as if he had not received an answer, trying to ruin you.  He does it out of intent to mock.  Perhaps, having received this job, you will come across just such a non-understanding ‚Äúsimple truths‚Äù by the client. <br><br>  Remember that many of the questions asked do not have the correct answers, so it is not the effectiveness that will be evaluated, but the desire to find a solution, as if you were negotiating with a client and had to convince him that you need it. </h6><br><h4>  <font color="#e41825">// Make friends with a cat</font> <br></h4><h6>  Be prepared for the fact that HR can constantly interrupt you in mid-sentence, rush, stop, express distrust of your words, in general, be the worst interlocutor in your life: ‚ÄúAll this is nonsense, nonsense‚Äù, ‚ÄúWell, it‚Äôs hardly in our company useful ‚Äù,‚Äú Closer to the case ‚Äù,‚Äú We ‚Äã‚Äãare not interested in what you still have? ‚ÄùIn this situation, do not try to argue with a specialist - this will lead to conflict and a fight.  Keep calm and check with   , , which particular moments do not suit him, and suggest an alternative.  Be cunning and flexible. <br><br>  There are many methods of conducting a stress interview, but in any case it should end on a positive note.  In a good way, the recruiter is obliged to explain to you the purpose for which provocative questions were asked.  If the interview ended in the same rigid form as it began, then this can only speak of the incompetence of the HR specialist.  As a rule, after such an interview, candidates rarely accept an invitation to work, and stress interviews are considered just an insult. </h6><br><h4>  <font color="#e41825">// PS Situation - Changeling</font> <br></h4><h6>  Sometimes, the stress interviewer transfers the employer himself.  He who is definitely not ready for this is him.  Maintain self-control - the main rule in this game. <br><br>  <b>Replica</b> <br>  <i>Andrei, head of IT department at Elvis-NeoTek, interviewed an applicant for a software testing engineer position:</i> <br><br>  ‚ÄúI started with standard questions (approaches to software quality assessment, test cases, well-known technologies).  She mumbles something indistinct, does not know, in short, nothing.  Well, I think, if a person is of a technical mentality, he will master it.  Begin to ask something from the server, combinatorics.  She looks at me, claps eyes, moos.  Well, I think, kapets, madam on an engineer get settled came.  And the most important thing is persuading everything: "Well, ask something else, I will answer."  Here is a strange man. <br><br>  I already have the impression that it was not after reading the resume, but I continue the communication, as there are still chances to take a person.  The third question, the fourth - again failure.  I don‚Äôt want to take such an employee, I want to part.  And then: ‚ÄúWell, ask something else!‚Äù Well, that‚Äôs pointless!  If you do not answer, then ‚Äúdosvidos‚Äù, but even if you answer, it will not change anything: the previous failures will not disappear from this!  In short, it makes no sense to ask to ask something else when the interviewer already wants to end the conversation. <br><br>  But the girl asks to ask her something else.  Well, not ‚Äú2X2‚Äù to ask, right?  Okay, I ask: "How many bytes are in kilobytes?" Pause.  Clap-clap eyes. <br><br>  ‚ÄúOne hundred?‚Äù - she answers not, she asks me not.  I'm starting to smile.  ‚ÄúA thousand?‚Äù - the girl almost cries.  "Thousand ... Million ??" - is just trying to guess.  Well, in general, she did not pass the interview. ‚Äù </h6><br>  About ten ways to fill up the interview can be found <a href="http://icanchoose.ru/blog/10-sposobov-zavalit-sobesedovanie/">here</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/291036/">https://habr.com/ru/post/291036/</a></p>
