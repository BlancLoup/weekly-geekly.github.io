You can learn to extract the greatest benefit from your nature, while going against society, which nevertheless favors larks, or you can develop your makings of an early bird.  Each person has them, in one way or another, and is expressed in varying degrees, so that you can use your own reserves. <br><br>  I will bring clarity - you are not guaranteed immediate success, happiness or a perfect body, if you get up at 6 in the morning and not at 7:30.  However, if your schedule, life, children or boss oblige to get out of bed early in the morning - you have to force yourself.  Here are the best ways to adjust the natural daily biorhythm and awaken the lark in yourself.

    <h2>  <font color="#0071c5">1. Adequate sleep hygiene</font> </h2><br>  It is known that most Americans do not get enough sleep.  Sleep time is determined by the individual characteristics of the person.  However, at least two hours before bedtime, it is better not to eat, not to exercise, not to sit in front of the monitor.  Only in this way you will get into the rhythm of your body (it is desirable to give up caffeine after 10 am or at all).  Those who suffer from insomnia or serious sleep disorders, such as sleep apnea, need medical intervention. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0071c5">2. Morning health rituals</font> </h2><br>  If you tend to fall asleep and wake up again after the alarm went off, and getting out of bed, you immediately watch the tape on Facebook or run to the bathroom, knowing that you are already late - you only harm yourself.  A healthy morning routine carries a charge of calm, you must prepare your body for a new day.  Hang on (if you want, you can do it in bed).  Take care of your skin every morning, try to start the day with warm water with lemon instead of coffee (if you really want, you can drink coffee after 30 minutes), and forget about the end button on the alarm clock.  (We recommend reading a useful article <a href="http://blog.mbaconsult.ru/blog/personal/dzen-rannikh-probuzhdeniy-10-sposobov-zakrepleniya-utrennego-rituala/">about 10 ways of fixing the morning ritual.</a> ) <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0071c5">3. Create a list of tasks that need to be done before 10 am</font> </h2><br>  Larks often say that they are more successful because they have ‚Äúdone so much already‚Äù before their colleagues come to the office.  <a href="http://blog.mbaconsult.ru/blog/personal/kak-priderzhivatsya-balansa-v-virtualnoy-zhizni/">Prioritize yourself</a> as if you were working in the field of medical triage: decide what needs to be done in any case and / or requires the most attention.  Everyone will have different business - make sure that the children go to school, taking a delicious lunch with them, or respond to client's request X, before undertaking any other project.  Determine what you can do before 10 am, and encourage yourself by devoting yourself time in the afternoon. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0071c5">4. In the evening, do as many things as you can.</font> </h2><br>  Do you catch yourself thinking that you postpone a lot of simple tasks in the morning, and then you don‚Äôt have time to do anything?  Prepare clothes, gym bag, pack lunch and wash the dishes in the evening.  In addition, it is better to spend time before going to bed that way, rather than lying on the couch with a laptop. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0071c5">5. Take a shower in the evening</font> </h2><br>  In some countries, for example in South Korea, a shower in the morning is surprising, because in the morning so much can be done.  Take a shower or (even better) a bath, wash your hair, shave, etc.  better evening.  You will save a lot of time in the morning, you can use it during the day.  In addition, after a hot shower or bath you will feel sleepy, so it is even useful. <br><br>  So, the lark does not always get what he wants, but in spite of this, he clearly succeeds.  Try to change your habits, making your morning more useful for yourself and finding out what you are capable of. <br><br>  PS We recommend another article on the topic - <a href="http://blog.mbaconsult.ru/blog/personal/kak-poluchit-ot-kofeina-maksimum-energii/">How to get maximum energy from caffeine.</a> <br><br>  Translated by Vyacheslav Davidenko, founder of <a href="http://www.mbaconsult.ru/">MBA Consult</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/290752/">https://habr.com/ru/post/290752/</a></p>
