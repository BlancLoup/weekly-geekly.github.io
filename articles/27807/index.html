  <section class="page js-page"><h1>RuPyRu 2008 Conference</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/937/f4e/23f/937f4e23f9811574b2ef38146ac193d0.jpg" width="410" height="307" alt="RuPyRu 2008" hspace="10" vspace="10"><br>  On June 21st, a regular conference on Python and Ruby was held in Omsk State University - <a href="http://www.rupy.ru/">RuPyRu 2008</a> .  This event is held only the second time, but this did not prevent to gather people from different cities.  Briefly - the conference was a success. <br><a name="habracut"></a>  The organizers of this event aim to popularize the programming languages ‚Äã‚ÄãPython and Ruby.  Judging by the fact that I and my friend (both of the main language of the PHP) got to this conference and were pleased with it, you can judge a lot.  Listening to all reports did not allow the breakdown of reports into two streams: general and special.  We tried to capture as much as possible: <br><ul><li>  <b><a href="http://www.rupy.ru/member/9/">Grigory Petukhov ‚ÄúDjango newforms‚Äù</a></b> is a good introductory report on Django newforms, a person who never saw Django had no difficulty in understanding the mechanism of work and evaluate the capabilities of this library.  It‚Äôs a pity the speaker was a little worried, but I think the topic he raised was more than a little puzzled during the story. </li><li>  <b><a href="http://www.rupy.ru/member/125/">Vladimir Byrgazov ‚ÄúA bit about Twisted‚Äù</a></b> - unfortunately, the speaker, taking a rather voluminous and interesting topic, tried to talk about everything without telling about anything.  In many other reports, we have heard many times about the Twisted library and, honestly, it was only from them that we understood what it was like. </li><li>  <b><a href="http://www.rupy.ru/member/3/">Mikhail Gusarov ‚ÄúInterfaces and Plugins in Python‚Äù</a></b> is a good report both in terms of material and manner of the report.  The speaker quickly ran through all the theoretical aspects of the plug-in system, highlighting their main advantages and disadvantages. </li><li>  <b><a href="http://www.rupy.ru/member/4/">Ivan Nemytchenko ‚ÄúHAML / SASS‚Äù</a></b> is a qualitative report that raised the question of an alternative look at the HTML markup language and the language of CSS styles.  Although I don‚Äôt like the creation of such a bicycle, the speaker was able to attract attention and listen to the report to the end. </li><li>  <b><a href="http://www.rupy.ru/member/103/">Oleg Dashevsky ‚ÄúStrokeDB‚Äù</a></b> - it is always nice to hear a story about a product or technology from the mouth of one of the developers, or an active committer.  Oleg was able to provide quite interesting information on the features of this object database, as well as tell about its main working mechanisms.  The disadvantages include the fact that the speaker rather delicately avoided the performance issue of a non-relational database written in Ruby. </li><li>  <b><a href="http://www.rupy.ru/member/136/">Alexey Grigorovich ‚ÄúProgramming phone services in JavaScript‚Äù</a></b> - as the speaker said, this is a report on non-traditional ways of using JavaScript.  Quite an interesting story about the practical application of JS, not only as a scripting language for the Web.  The only drawback of the report was a large amount of code on the slides.  Honestly, after the 3rd slide, the head could no longer understand the intricacies of the code. </li><li>  <b><a href="http://www.rupy.ru/member/76/">Gennady Puzyrev ¬´Cheetah templates.</a></b>  <b><a href="http://www.rupy.ru/member/76/">Report Development ‚Äù</a></b> - a report by our countryman on the use of a template engine for creating reports.  The report was very good, because  Gennady was able not only to tell about the template maker Cheetah, but also to consider in detail the features that defined it as the optimal choice for creating an answer visualization subsystem.  For us, this report was particularly interesting, since we also have to work with a large number of reports at work. </li><li>  <b><a href="http://www.rupy.ru/member/123/">Mikhail Ovsyannikov, Mikhail Filonov ‚ÄúVDOM-Box software and hardware complex‚Äù</a></b> - presentation report.  The guys presented a rather interesting approach to building platforms for creating web applications for small and medium businesses.  This joint French-Chinese-Russian development is a hardware-software complex.  It is too early to talk about any serious results, but there is hope that this undertaking will not die and occupy its niche in the market. </li><li>  <b><a href="http://www.rupy.ru/member/21/">Sergey Dobrov ‚ÄúPython tools for creating Jabber services and transports‚Äù</a></b> - a report review of Jabber / XMPP technologies and tools for creating applications for them in Python.  Distinctively qualitative and interesting report. </li></ul>  This is all that we managed to listen to, not heard soon should be available on video.  So who is interested, swing, watch and come to the next conference. </div>
