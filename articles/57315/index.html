  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Do nic.lv steal domains? Registrar - cybersquatter</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  At the request of my prospective client, I chose a domain name for his project for several days.  I checked the register of Latvian enterprises and the base of European trademarks - there was no coincidence with the domain name.  I submitted an application (via web interface) to nic.lv for registering a domain ***. Lv, received a standard e-mail, indicating that the application will be reviewed within three working days and ... how great was my surprise when I received the answer : according to the registrar version, on that day two applications were received for this domain and mine was the second.  Domain has been registered to another person. <br><br>  I hardly ever believe that the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãregistering the same domain occurs to two different people on the same day.  I called Latnet and asked for clarification of the situation.  According to their version, someone else's application was filed 50 minutes earlier than mine! <br><br>  I do not believe in miracles and coincidences.  There is - a leak to third parties.  I do not believe that the Latnet server is under the control of ‚Äúhackers‚Äù and the information about registration requests ‚Äúgoes to the left‚Äù without the help of at least one nic.lv employee.  After all, Latvian Cert is based in the same company - and that means real network security professionals work there.  (sarcasm) In the end: time is lost, the order for the site and customer confidence.

      Talking about what happened to my friends, I heard from them that rumors about such cases have been going on for a long time.  But the most interesting thing was that there were two more people who had ‚Äútaken away‚Äù domains according to exactly the same scenario. <br><br>  The ongoing chaos certainly should be stopped.  If the management of nic.lv considers that there is nothing criminal in the actions of their employees, and two applications for one domain fit into the ‚Äúprobability theory‚Äù for one hour, the investigation of the mathematical calculations of nic.lv will be taken up by icann and other organizations and departments. <br><br>  Quotation <a href="http://businesspress.ru/newspaper/article_mId_21961_aId_311827.html">from an interview</a> with Katrina Sataki, Nic.lv Deputy Director (2004): <blockquote>  At the beginning of the Latvian cybersquatting boom, the Institute of Mathematics and Informatics registered the most delicious addresses: music.lv, books.lv, rent.lv, gramatas.lv and cd.lv.  As Katrina Sataki explained, this step was taken to stop the domain speculation process: ‚ÄúWhen the cybersquatting boom started in 1997, our institute responded by changing the registration rules for protecting trademarks and company names.  In addition, we registered the most "beautiful" names.  Perhaps it was not entirely fair.  We assumed the role of the master of destinies and, at our discretion, we decided who to give the address to and who did not, but the result was good. </blockquote>  The role of the ‚Äúmaster of destinies‚Äù and now someone plays inside the monopolist for the sale of domain names .lv, determining who will give the ‚Äútasty domain‚Äù to.  How long ? <br><br>  To this topic: <br>  <a title="NIC.LV - again they stole the domain." href="http://bad.ilink.lv/2008/07/nic-lv-ukraki-domen/">NIC.LV - again they stole the domain.</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/57315/">https://habr.com/ru/post/57315/</a></p>
