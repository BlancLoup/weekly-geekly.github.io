We invite everyone to the next Hiring Tournament in Moscow</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Probably difficult to find someone who would love an interview.  Agree that it is tedious to transfer your affairs, to go somewhere, to communicate with an HR manager, and possibly with two, while answering frankly disgusted questions of the same type.  But finding a job is not always tedious talking to people who do not understand you.  That is why we conduct our <a href="https://crossover.timepad.ru/event/710650/%3Futm_refcode%3D6a48caf5d5a7381b39f9e487d1858f00d20b14b3">Hiring Tournaments</a> , about which, by the way, <a href="https://habr.com/company/crossover/blog/351328/">Habr's readers responded</a> very well.  But back to why we do this at all. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/76a/2a1/782/76a2a1782e44fa9571eb5c1473ae9ebc.jpg" alt="image"></div><br>  A classic interview with a representative of an HR department may become even more unbearable than usual.  How?  Yes, very simple.  The situation is aggravated if the interview does not have a direct manager, or worse, the interview is divided into 3-4 stages. <br><br>  First, a representative of the HR-department conducts a telephone interview with you, asking simple and not always the right questions.  Then you are assigned an interview, where everything repeats, only now in some stuffy conversation.  Then you wait for the call until HR expands all the resumes in two piles, and then you go to the next ‚Äúlevel‚Äù of the interview.  The apogee of all this could be a request to ‚Äúwrite code on a list‚Äù or a question of the level ‚Äútell us about the TCP / IP stack.  Readers with a violent fantasy by this time had a couple of vessels in their eyes burst, from which they were filled with blood. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  What do technicians who are looking for work annoy the hiring procedure most?  There are actually several popular answers, but this one leads: ‚Äúit is impossible to demonstrate your real skills at an interview.‚Äù  This situation can be compared to buying a car, focusing only on its color and sound of the horn.  Seriously?  Why should a cool techie smile at people who don‚Äôt even always understand what he does, strive to please them in order to get a new job on his interesting project?

      This situation on the labor market in the IT segment in fact leads to despondency of even the most optimistic people.  We do not argue, there are people who know how to go on interviews and they even like it, but let's be clear: the ability to communicate with people does not mean a high level of skills.  As a result, the work gets the most charming, sociable, talkative, or just opportunists. <br><br>  We do not agree with this situation, therefore we hold our tournaments.  Of course, from the stage of the interview it does not completely release, but we reduce this contact to a minimum and after demonstrating the level of skills.  After all, the best way for a specialist to present himself is to show that he can. <br><br>  That is why we are <a href="https://crossover.timepad.ru/event/710650/%3Futm_refcode%3D6a48caf5d5a7381b39f9e487d1858f00d20b14b3">holding a new Hiring Tournament in Moscow</a> , already on May 12.  This time we are looking for people in the position of SVP of Technical Product Management, VP of Technical Product Management, and Software Engineering Manager for salaries ranging from $ 100 to $ 400 thousand per year.  You saw in the title of each position "manager" and think to close the article?  Do not hurry. <br><br>  We have already talked about Software Engineering Manager in our publications and can be read <a href="https://habr.com/company/crossover/blog/350610/">here</a> and <a href="https://www.crossover.com/softwareengineeringmanager%3Futm_campaign%3DMoscowMay12">here</a> .  SEM takes the position of development manager and manages one or more teams on the project. <br><br>  VP of TM is a person who works with product teams and, in fact, leads the development of a product or even several.  Using the example of Maxim Vinnikov, we <a href="https://habr.com/company/crossover/blog/353196/">told</a> that this is work in the "major league", since these specialists make key decisions on projects and development, denoting a common "course", being in the past, at the same time, experienced developers. <br><br>  SVP of TM is a larger specialist and is the direct supervisor of the above mentioned VP. <br><br>  All that unites these positions is the need to be a high-class specialist.  We are sure that a person who does not understand what his subordinates do is not entitled to be a leader.  That is why the announcement of our tournament you read on Habr√©, and not anywhere else.  We know that such people should be looked for in the main IT community of the RuNet. <br><br>  If you are not a default city resident, but you want to try your hand at remote work with hourly pay, instead of piecework, we invite you to familiarize yourself with the vacancies in <a href="http://xo-link.com/jobs">our showcase</a> and also take part in one of the many online tournaments that are held for specialists the most different directions.  There is one more news for our friends from Belarus.  Now Crossover organizes its presence in the capital of the republic and is looking for the necessary specialists in the field.  Agree to ignore such a large IT hub, which is now Minsk, extremely short-sighted.  So in the near future, similar events will be available for Minsk dwellers and residents of the Republic of Belarus without having to travel to another country. <br><br>  We will always answer your questions in the comments or in personal messages.  Ask, happy to help.  See you at the <a href="https://crossover.timepad.ru/event/710650/%3Futm_refcode%3D6a48caf5d5a7381b39f9e487d1858f00d20b14b3">Hiring Tournament</a> tomorrow, May 12th.  Registration is required, free and open to all comers.  The event will last from 9:00 to 16:00.  See you! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/358296/">https://habr.com/ru/post/358296/</a></p>
