  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Why is the ‚ÄúProject for Interest‚Äù a failure?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Freelancers, and not only often faced with the proposal to work under the percentage.  And subconsciously, the dominant majority of us realize that these projects are a failure. <br>  But after all it would be desirable to believe, to understand - <u>why so</u> , and what to make, that "not so".  I suggest doing it immediately, so ... <br>  Why the ‚ÄúProject for interest‚Äù is a failure.  First of all, I would single out <b>distrust</b> .  Distrust plays a very important role in any cooperation and partnership - there is none, there is neither cooperation nor partnership.  But distrust did not come from the air, it is based solely on statistics.  There are no official statistics on this topic, but there is a collective opinion on the topic and most of us have it - many people tried to work this way, but nothing came of it, or it turned out for a few. <br>  And here we miss one important detail - most of the projects did not fail, but simply did not even reach the beta stage.  It seems that we are closer to the conclusions on the issue.  But far away. <br>  I talked to many "startups" in a similar topic, and with their performers, or more competently - co-founders.  As a result, I identified 4 more errors: [here is a cat, there are a lot of letters :)] <a name="habracut"></a><br>  <i>1.</i> No full command. <br>  Often the same programmer, bears the burden of the designer, the advertiser - the manager and so on.  It's not a question.  If it is, for example, a startup on the internet, then at least we need people responsible for programming, layout, design, promotion.  As a rule - a programmer, coder, designer and seo-specialist.  In addition, greed (work alone, get more) leads only to more errors, incompetent evaluation of the result and so on. <br>  <i>2.</i> Unworthy project management. <br>  Do this, I do not know how.  Can not be realized - think up.  This is one example.  As a rule, you can consider a prescriptive tone in management (And you are potentially co-founders), endowing non-professional responsibilities (Drawing design for a programmer, for example) and so on.  Up to the search for the first available, illiterate developers or thieves of ideas. <br>  <i>3.</i> Otsustviyu clear TZ, frequent edits. <br>  Well, when there is a final technical task.  Worse, when making changes and do it often.  Worse when there is no technical specification.  No need to be lazy, make a normal technical task.  And it is desirable to make it in the presence of potential co-founders, immediately assessing the possibilities.  And, of course, no parallel edits.  Better to make a "beta", and then follow the improvements.  Otherwise, failure. <br>  <i>4. The</i> absence of business plans and marketing research. <br>  This is the main problem.  They made a project, and how to get the money is unknown, or the amounts are not commensurate with the costs (albeit temporary) for development, and so on.  How can you do business without it?  But mostly most of the projects are done without them.  Needed - a business plan.  And it should be done on the basis of marketing research.  This is confidence in the future, the transparency of potential income and the absence of stupid questions from developers, in management and so on and so forth. <br>  <u>Recipe</u> : Start with marketing research ideas.  Spend at least 2 days to work in this direction.  Create a business plan.  Podromny, and not optimistic (although it is more important. It is better to get more than planned) and pessimistic.  Start looking for like-minded professionals.  When you found those in whom sure.  Start together on the basis of a plan (or prepare a ‚Äúskeleton in advance‚Äù) to write terms of reference.  And then - individually.  And preferably, according to my essay.  Do not step on a rake, especially 2-3 times!  <b>The project at a percentage (for interest) - a reality!</b> </div>
