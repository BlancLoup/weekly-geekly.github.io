From my experience, I can say that life and work with this system occurs according to this biorhythm: <br><img src="http://drupaldance.com/files/drupal_sinusoid.gif"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Hollows - this is where, you run into a problem, to solve which you need to read the documentation, increase your programming knowledge or leave the apartment and relax a little.  One should remember this when reading <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/drupal/44980/">such articles</a> and listening to <a href="">such reports</a> (recording from RIT of the famous report by Ilya Azarov). <br><br>  Peaks - sudden insights "Damn, it turns out this could be done without resorting to a hammer and chisel."

    <h4>  <b>Basic problems of beginning-average Drupal programmers</b> </h4><br><br> <a href=""><img src="http://drupaldance.com/files/drupal_blind.gif" align="left"></a> <br><br>  <b>1. The ability to make hasty conclusions.</b> <br>  The figure on the left shows the general scheme of the themeization of Drupal, or rather, how the newcomer sees it at once.  Naturally, seeing only the tip of the iceberg, he thinks that he was ‚ÄúDrupal Saks‚Äù and doesn‚Äôt dig further. <br><br>  <b>2. Fear of writing their modules.</b> <br>  If we talk about drupal, then the fear of writing our modules from our developers can be compared with the loss of virginity.  Before <i>that</i> , very scary.  After - you do not know how without this and lived earlier.  Probably, this is because the meaning of the word ‚Äúmodule‚Äù is associated with something important and special (the docking station of the space station), and the idea that there might just be a custom piece of code does not occur to it. <br><br>  <b>3. Fear of someone else's code.</b> <br>  Many questions would be avoided if the developers looked into the source codes.  Some do not know where to start, others simply disdain to "climb into someone else's code."  Meanwhile, it helps a lot in studying the system, and in raising its professional level, since the bulk of the drupal code is licked more than a plate of a different cat after absorbing whiskey. <br><br>  <b>4. Fear of patches.</b> <br>  For the most part, there is nothing extra-bad about using custom patches in projects.  In the <a href="http://rbn.ru/">last site</a> , which I did, 16 patches were used.  For the most part they were caused by special, not quite standard, project requirements.  However, I do not experience any special headaches during system updates, since, if you did everything correctly, applying a patch to a project in SVN happens in two mouse clicks. <br><br>  <b>5. Ignorance of English.</b> <br>  I actively participate in the life support form of <a href="http://drupal.ru/">drupal.ru</a> , and I can assure you that freelance schoolchildren who do not speak English cry most loudly about the wretchedness of Drupal.  I will answer briefly on this point: call yourself a programmer - so be kind, learn English, <b>everything is</b> documented in English. <br>  <i>For the sake of truth, it is worth noting that there is enough in Russian documentation.</i> <br><br><h4>  <b>"Problems" of Drupal himself</b> </h4><br><br><h5>  1. Caching </h5><br><br>  Time: a year ago <br>  Location: <a href="http://sourcemaking.com/">sourcemaking.com</a> <br>  Hosting: average VDS <br>  Optimization: no standard cache (then I didn‚Äôt know much about it;) <br><br>  I'll be brief: <br><img src="http://drupaldance.com/files/drupal_traf.png"><br><br><h5>  2. All-in-one file </h5><br>  The problem is sucked from the finger.  If a programmer has such a situation, he is just inexperienced. <br>  Especially for those who do not know or can not - <a href="http://ua2.php.net/require">require</a> / <a href="http://ua2.php.net/include/">include</a> . <br>  <i>And in the sixth drupale, there is also support for sharing in menu hooks.</i> <br><br><h5>  3. Conflict of module X and module Y </h5><br>  Yes, such a problem exists.  How can not conflict 2 things that make some operations on a single entity?  Of course, Drupal is to blame for everything, he also provides flexibility and access to literally everything.  The problem partially disappears after a long acquaintance with the system and careful selection of modules.  Until then, shouts will be heard that from this: <br><img src="http://drupaldance.com/files/drupal_cars.gif"><br>  The spoiler from Lamborghini falls down. <br><br><h4>  <b>Drupal is not for the lazy</b> </h4><br>  Unfortunately or fortunately, but it is.  If you want to make a good website in two days, you will fail.  In Drupal it is necessary to delve into and enter at least six months to consider himself his master, and not vice versa.  Here is the learning curve that everyone is talking about, but no one has seen: <br><img src="http://drupaldance.com/files/drupal_curve.gif"><br>  <i>(the schedule is localized specifically for Russian-speaking users)</i> <br><br><h4>  Yes, there are problems, <b>but</b> </h4><br>  The improvement of the core work is ongoing. <br>  Bugs are fixed promptly. <br>  New modules come out every day. <br>  Documentation is gradually being translated into Russian. <br>  Users in support forums get answers every minute. <br><br>  And finally - there are more and more new sites built on Drupal. <br><br>  And most importantly, all this is done not only by some abstract people across the ocean, but by <b>us</b> , the <a href="http://drupal.ru/">Russian-speaking community of Drupal</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/46899/">https://habr.com/ru/post/46899/</a></p>
