  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Knowledge Factory</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  It's been almost two months since my last <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/sokatovo/blog/186120/">post about education</a> .  I began to write different people and ask how things were going.  I deliberately did not publish anything until everything was more or less settled.  But now I‚Äôm glad to officially announce the launch of the Knowledge Factory project in Sokatovo. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage3/02f/ef6/c53/02fef6c53126a5a0e3454a2b8dcbac40.jpg" alt="image"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  I was able to agree on conducting mathematical courses with the Laboratory of Continuing Mathematical Education (LNMO), which was <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/87800/">already mentioned</a> in Habr√©.  At present, the Laboratory conducts education in grades 8-11, although the level of mathematics overlaps with most universities.  Until now, such knowledge could only be obtained within the framework of a general education program (secondary and higher education), and even then not in every institution. <br><br>  This laboratory has been around for over twenty years.  You can talk a lot about what amazing knowledge it gives (this is a topic for a separate article), but the best indicator of work is the list of achievements of its graduates.  The picture above is a picture of one of the corridors of the LNMO, where diplomas for prizes at various events are displayed.  The list of achievements of the laboratory can be found <a href="http://sokatovo.co-de.org/knowledge/lnmo/">on our website</a> - it is not just impressive, it is stunning.  In this list you can find a lot of habra people.

      The laboratory is a fully private educational institution and has the necessary licenses.  The teaching staff consists mostly of candidates and doctors of science.  In fact, all this means that we will have not just mathematics courses, but excellent international courses that will be useful even to those who have already received a higher education. <br><br>  As mentioned earlier, the project will be launched on the basis of the existing <a href="http://sokatovo.ru/">Sokatovo</a> production site.  We are making the purchase of necessary furniture and equipment, as well as some other preparatory activities, so in two or three weeks we will be ready to accept the first group of people who want to get knowledge in the framework of our project.  We have ambitious plans for the future, but we need to start small. <br><br>  Now we are ready to launch two different educational programs, for each of which we plan to invite 10 people. <br><br>  The first program is correspondence course.  It consists of two parts: an introductory course in Sokatovo from 02.11.2013 to 09.11.2013 (autumn school holidays), and a correspondence course for self-study based on materials issued.  All the necessary questions can be asked remotely.  The second visit is from 04/01/2013 to 01/11/2013 (winter holidays).  Terms - approximate, exact dates will be known later. <br><br>  The second program is full-time study.  Dates of arrival in Sokatovo will depend on the course.  In parallel with the math courses, programming courses will be available.  The exact list will be announced later. <br><br>  Of the important - the cost.  Currently, Sokatovo can take only ten people - most of the premises have not yet been renovated, but many of those who want to participate in our project have volunteered to come.  Therefore, we offer participants of the second barter program: we have the knowledge that we have for participating in the repair of premises.  With us - training in unique courses, accommodation and meals, as well as transfer from the nearest major settlements - Nerl, Teikovo, Suzdal.  Groups of several people can pick up from Vladimir and Ivanovo.  From you - the willingness to learn and help in the repair.  No special skills are required - get the necessary skills in place. <br><br>  Participants in the first program receive everything for free, but will be selected as a result of the competition.  And the most interesting is possible courses.  The specific course for each group will be selected individually, depending on the degree of training of participants.  Qualification of teachers allows you to touch almost any area of ‚Äã‚Äãhigher mathematics, but first we want to offer the following: <br><br><ol><li>  School level <ol><li>  Sets and relationships </li><li>  Groupoids </li><li>  Groups and graphs </li><li>  Introduction to Algebraic Graph Theory </li><li>  Finite-dimensional vector spaces </li><li>  Introduction to the theory of matrices and its position </li></ol><br></li><li>  Student level <ol><li>  Mathematical structures and mathematical modeling </li><li>  Computable and not computable </li><li>  Fundamentals of group theory </li><li>  Analysis and Topology </li><li>  Geometry and groups </li></ol><br></li><li>  High level <ol><li>  Introduction to Algebraic Topology </li><li>  Algebraic semi-group theory </li><li>  Applied non-standard analysis </li><li>  Introduction to Measure Theory </li><li>  Geometric Integral Theory </li></ol><br></li><li>  Advanced level <ol><li>  Basics of computer algebra with applications </li><li>  Semigroups and combinatorial applications </li><li>  Category Theory for Mathematics and Programmer </li><li>  Galois topological theory </li><li>  Rings and modules </li><li>  Combinatorial group theory </li><li>  Enumerated combinatorics </li><li>  Homology theory </li></ol></li></ol><br>  In order to determine the degree of preparation and select the best, in the near future we will announce a competition.  Several non-trivial tasks will be proposed, which will be allotted for two weeks.  The authors of the top ten solutions will be invited to the correspondence program.  The second ten of the best - will receive an invitation to come on the second program. <br><br>  If you are interested in the program, please participate in our survey: <habracut></habracut></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/192580/">https://habr.com/ru/post/192580/</a></p>
