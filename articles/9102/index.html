  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Rupay Announces Big Changes</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Just on the site rupay.com appeared the following news: <br><br><blockquote>  Moscow, May 29, 2007  - Rupay Internet reckoning system rebranding, changing the strategy and improving the system's technological platform, as the company management told the media today at a press conference. <br></blockquote><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><blockquote>  At the press conference, Ruslan Popov, Development Director Rupay, Mikhail Peftiev, Lead Security Analyst of the Rupay System, Andrei Morozov, Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Financial Systems Group of Companies, Konstantin Kharabet, Vice-President of the Bar of Corporate Defense , A legal advisor.  The event was hosted by Timur Aitov, Development Director of the Russian Association of Electronic Communications (RAEC). <br><br>  At the press conference, Ruslan Popov, Development Director, demonstrated a new website with modern design, with an emphasis on aesthetics.  The site has an intuitive interface, meets modern standards of navigation, based on the latest technologies.  Now the convenience of Rupay has increased significantly, the speed and reliability of the system, and the range of services offered has been expanded.  For two weeks (from May 29 to June 12, 2007), the ‚Äúold‚Äù and new sites will function, which will allow numerous Rupay users to study the features of the new system. <br>  Ruslan Popov also made a presentation of Rupay.Mobile - a mobile wallet that allows you to use all the features of the system directly from your mobile phone, anytime and anywhere.  Media representatives were able to appreciate the benefits of Rupay.Mobile by replenishing their cell phone accounts directly at the press conference. <br>  The company management spoke about the transition of the system to a single accounting unit, equivalent to the Russian ruble.  For system users, this means transparency and the absence of additional costs when shopping in online stores, full control over their expenses on the Internet. <br>  Of particular interest to the audience was the presentation of Mikhail Peftiev, who spoke about the Rupay 100% Guarantee online certification program, unique to the Russian e-commerce market.

    </blockquote><br><br>  Alarmed 2 points. <br><br>  1) "The company management spoke about the transition of the system to a single accounting unit equivalent to the Russian ruble."  Does this mean that the amount in my account will be transferred from the dollar equivalent to the ruble one?  If so, at what rate?  Given my extensive experience with this system, I can assume that the rupees will not have the opportunity to earn money on this exchange transaction, that is, they will receive their 3-5% commission "just like that."  And if you multiply these percentages by the total amount of money in the accounts of the system, I think the amount will be rather big. <br><br>  2) On the new site (which is mentioned in the news) in the methods of input and output, as well as in the description of tariffs there is no mention of working with Ukraine at all.  Let me remind you that now with the system is sharpened for work with Russia and Ukraine, that is, the main methods of input and output relate to these two countries.  Do changes to rupay mean a big blow for all Ukrainian users who will only have to enter / withdraw money through electronic systems like Webmoney and Yandex.Money (although the latter is still more Russian than the Ukrainian or international system). <br><br>  With both questions I immediately went to the online support system of the rupay system.  For some reason, I had to wait a long time for an answer, first to one, then to another question.  Nevertheless, the operator reassured that, in essence, no bad changes for existing users should be expected.  The transition to the ruble equivalent, as it turned out, is related only to the Rupay.Mobile system, and the methods for depositing and withdrawing money remain the same, including for Ukraine. <br><br>  It is not clear, however, why the new site contains ‚Äútruncated‚Äù information, in which many of the actually existing methods of depositing / withdrawing money are not listed, despite the fact that today, this version works right along with the old version of the site. <br><br>  The original is published on <a href="http://ugolok.4merlin.com/">http://ugolok.4merlin.com</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/9102/">https://habr.com/ru/post/9102/</a></p>
