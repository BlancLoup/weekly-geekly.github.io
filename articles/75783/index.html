    <h4>  Step 1: Idea </h4><br>  I have been creating websites for quite a long time, but I didn‚Äôt attend to any thoughts about creating my online store.  Somehow I made an online storefront for one company engaged in the wholesale delivery of civilian weapons (hunting, travmatik, pneumatics) and after a while we had a cup of tea and talked with its owner.  It turned out that the money invested in the creation of the site, paid off in a few months. <br><br>  Then I took another closer look at the site, which without systematic work on it, and any kind of promotion paid off within a few months.  If they do more serious, you can increase profits and earn some money.  What I suggested to the owner: I support and promote, for which I receive interest from sales.  That day we did not agree, but after a few months he called me and offered to cooperate. <br><br><h4>  Step 2: Getting Started </h4><br>  It should be said that it is very difficult to open an arms trade store from scratch: you need to obtain the appropriate licenses, equip a weapon room, etc.  All this is quite not cheap. <br><br>  Therefore, they began to work according to this scheme: I was engaged in the creation and promotion of the store, and sales were made through a company that has all the licenses, etc. <br><br><h4>  Step 3: Results </h4><br>  It took me about a month to create a store script and fill the product catalog.  Then start a sale.  As I expected, all the costs of <i>creating a</i> store paid off within a few months. <br><br><h4>  findings </h4><br>  Open the weapons online store <i>from scratch</i> just will not work.  Initial costs are too high and, plus, you will not receive the necessary discounts from the manufacturers' factories if you do not purchase the necessary volumes per month. <br><br>  The online store, opened with a dealer of manufacturing plants, is profitable for a couple of months. <br><br>  If you do it seriously, for a couple of years, you can catch up with the leaders of this market, the turnover of which exceeds 1M rubles per month. <br><br><h4>  A little bit about the interface </h4><br>  Mandatory registration in the online store - evil.  Some buyers have only a fax, which does not prevent them from shopping for tens of thousands of rubles.  In case you force them to register by e-mail and confirm the registration, they will leave by. <br><br>  Having worked in this area for about a year, I can say that almost all the solutions on the CMS market for online stores, from those that I have tried, satisfy only about half of the requirements necessary for successful arms trading.  Therefore, if you deal with this matter seriously, you will have to refine the ready-made solution for you.  I just wrote my own - I need a minimum, which can be greatly expanded and this will lead to an increase in sales.  And I had the opportunity to familiarize myself with the device of online stores of a couple of companies that are among the market leaders and I can say that there is room for improvement. <br><br>  I wrote this post as the beginning of a conversation.  Your questions would help me a lot in writing a sequel. <br><br>  UP: <br><br>  In the comments several times asked for a link.  Unfortunately forced to refuse.  Although I do not do the site, it is still on my server.  Habra effect is not something I would like to face today.  For some reason I think that the majority will go only to look and not convert to customers. <br><br>  UP 2: <br><br>  About the conversion was wrong.  There were several requests in PM that were converted into customers (: <br><br>  UP 3: <br><br>  In the comments they ask the question: ‚ÄúWhat should I do if the owner of the company shows you not the whole turn.  For example, he will sell 10 units, and he will give you 3 ". <br><br>  The sale of weapons is different from the sale of mp3 players.  There accounting is much stricter.  Therefore, tracking is quite simple: just look at the entries in the magazine sales.  When selling to wholesalers, they are not made; when selling to private owners, they are required.  Those.  See the entries in the sales journal (it is flashed and the pages are numbered, any correction in it is sealed), the name and address of each customer is indicated there and you select your customers from there. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/75783/">https://habr.com/ru/post/75783/</a></p>
