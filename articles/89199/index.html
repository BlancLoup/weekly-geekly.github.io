      - What is contextual advertising and why not SEO? <br>  - Why is it beneficial to make good ads? <br>  - How to make a good announcement? <br>  - 5 simple ways to increase ad CTR. <br>  - And that's not all ... <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h4>  Introduction.  What is contextual advertising and why not SEO? </h4><br>  Often, customers ask the question, <b>why should we abandon SEO in favor of contextual advertising</b> .  Usually, the answer immediately follows: "Contextual advertising will never replace search engine promotion, it complements it."  Contextual advertising, never wins SEO.  However, contextual advertising campaign will never ‚Äúfly out of issue‚Äù.  That is, the traffic, as it was going - and it will go regardless of the latest update. <br><br>  But this does not mean that SEO is better, there are topics where SEO will cost <b>3-4 times more</b> than contextual advertising.  And the context will bring together a larger audience than search engine optimization. <br><br>  Direct and Adwords is not the ‚Äúcheapest‚Äù tool.  There are advertisers in contextual advertising with a monthly budget of 5 million rubles. <br><br><h4>  Why is it beneficial to make a good announcement? </h4><br>  In Yandex.Direct, like in Google AdWords, there is an ad quality parameter and a bid parameter that the advertiser is willing to pay.  Yandex.Direct has a simple formula: <br><br>  <b>f (CTR * BID)</b> , where <br><br>  <b>CTR</b> is the ratio of the number of clicks on an ad to the number of impressions of this ad. <br>  <b>BID</b> - the maximum cost per click that the advertiser is willing to pay. <br><br>  That is, to be at the most clickable place, you need to either pay a lot or make a good announcement. <br><br>  <i>// True, there are a few not very significant parameters.</i>  <i>For example, finding a keyword in the title and ad text.</i> <br><br><h4>  How to make a good announcement? </h4><br>  The main problem of novice internet marketers is that they do not understand the main rule: ‚Äú <b>Offer the user what he is looking for</b> .‚Äù  Why offer to buy ‚Äúdrinking water‚Äù if he is looking for ‚Äúhow to bake bread‚Äù?  Although there are exceptions when it is profitable. <br><br>  The second problem is to choose only good high-frequency queries and not forget to minimize the garbage.  So, if you show up on demand for ‚Äúnurse‚Äù, you can spoil the mood of the advertiser.  For example, the announcement ‚Äú <b>Nanny for your child</b> ‚Äù will be shown on requests: <br><br>  - <i>nanny movie</i> <br>  - <i>porn nanny</i> <br>  - <i>babysitter online, etc.</i> <br><br>  These requests will lower the CTR, and the cost per click will greatly increase.  Often in Yandex.Direct, the system will disable the ad for a low CTR.  In such cases, it is better to choose low-frequency queries and make announcements on them.  For example: "nanny for a child." <br><br>  There are some more clever tricks to increase the CTR.  Here are the 5 most popular: <br><br><h4>  5 simple ways to increase contextual advertising CTR. </h4><br>  <b>1. For each keyword - its own ad.</b> <br><br>  Make a separate ad for each keyword.  If the user asks about the "gold ring", then offer to buy a gold ring.  If he asks for a "gold ring with amethyst", then the ad should be sent to this demand. <br><br>  <b>2. For each city - its own ad.</b> <br><br>  What do you think, which ad will be clicked more often in Perm? <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/3ec/94d/b63/3ec94db6307436414c514a0f1cef7235.png" alt="good and bad announcement"><br><br>  As practice shows, the second option will have approximately 8-12% CTR, and the first about 4-7% in special accommodation.  Therefore, it is necessary for each city to make their own announcement.  Then the user who requested the ‚Äúrailway container‚Äù in Perm will receive an advertisement for the sale of containers in Perm, and not ‚Äúin Russia‚Äù. <br><br>  <b>3. Minimize unnecessary words.</b> <br><br>  It is ridiculous to say this, but when I advise people on writing advertisements, in most cases negative words are not used at all.  Why show ads for those who do not need it?  This is not only unprofitable for the advertiser, but also significantly reduces the CTR. <br>  For one online store, I had to make almost perfect ads at one time.  I otminusoval all that prevented raise the CTR.  The result is amazing, here are the screenshots of the statistics: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/31a/c7d/159/31ac7d15985850a317a9b2988b939526.png" alt="example ad with high CTR"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/1dd/200/594/1dd20059411adbe6e9d8015a5f883fb5.png" alt="second example with high CTR"><br><br>  Needless to say, 35.16% CTR is a very good result?  Naturally pleased, and I, and the customer.  The customer gets more customers for little money, and I get more money from the commission in the aggregate. <br><br>  <b>4. Be original competitors.</b> <br><br>  First, do not need to copy a competitor's ad.  By this you do not stand out, but rather get lost. <br><br>  Secondly, write about what a competitor does not have.  So at the end of 2008, insurance companies greatly increased their clients by offering users ‚ÄúOSAGO calculators‚Äù.  Now requests ‚Äúcalculator Osago‚Äù more than 15,000 per month. <br><br>  <b>5. Night and day audience.</b> <br><br>  This topic is very suitable for online shopping, but can be used for other companies.  At night, many disable advertising campaigns.  Consequently, the competition at night is less. <br><br>  We start an additional ‚Äúnight‚Äù advertising campaign, and launch the ‚Äúorder form‚Äù or ‚Äúfeedback form‚Äù on the client‚Äôs website (if this is not an online store). <br><br><h4>  And that's not all ... </h4><br>  I did not go into details, but if you want habrayuzerov I can continue to write on this topic.  Every month new ‚Äúchips in contextual advertising‚Äù come off.  I can also write about how to get cheap traffic.  I also plan to do several experiments and show in practice how contextual advertising works. <br><br>  This is my first post on the Habr√©, so do not kick much :).  Express your wishes on posts about contextual advertising in the comments. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/89199/">https://habr.com/ru/post/89199/</a></p>
