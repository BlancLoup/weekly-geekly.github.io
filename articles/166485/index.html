  <section class="page js-page"><h1>What does the "excessive" kindness project manager</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  In most software companies, project managers perform several basic functions at once.  They communicate with clients, find out the requirements, control the process following, and of course work with subordinates.  Among other things, the work of a manager with subordinates includes such an important thing as giving feedback. <br><br>  What is its essence? <br><br>  A project manager (PM) always sees who is better and who is worse.  Who cares for the project, and who treats the work formally.  Who is constantly out of date, and who has time and still pulls on him lagging behind.  Who constantly offers some improvements, and who behaves passively.  Who is late for work and rallies, and who shows constant punctuality.  Who writes the curve code, and who tries to make their work quality and finds it humiliating for them to show the poor-quality code to their colleagues.  Who checks his work, trying to minimize the number of bugs, and who is in a hurry, just to shoot, and there is not much grass to grow. <br>  ‚ÄúGood‚Äù PM seldom or never approaches subordinates and does not point out flaws to them, does not scold for bad work.  At the same time, if something is done well, then most PMs are always happy to pat an employee on the shoulder and say: ‚ÄúYou are well done!‚Äù

      What is the result of such "kindness"? <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  The employees have the feeling that if they never curse him for anything, but only praise him, then he works well, and in this spirit, he should continue.  At the same time, since PM still cannot fail to see shortcomings, a negative can accumulate in PMA.  But at some point the negative overwhelms the patience of PMA.  The PM goes to the director and tells everything as if in spirit: ‚ÄúThis fellow programmer is always out of date, he is not interested in the project, he is constantly distracted by extraneous things and generally doesn‚Äôt code most of the time, but it‚Äôs not clear what he is doing.  Everything has to be redone, etc.  etc.".  The director, naturally, becomes indignant at the fact that someone constantly works worse than expected, and causes the programmer to debrief, which may well end in a proposal to end the working relationship and part. <br>  If the PM did not scold such an employee, then this comrade is naturally extremely surprised and declares: ‚ÄúHow so ?!  During my work I heard only praise!  They never scolded me and never said that I was doing something wrong!  Why now they fire me ?! ‚Äù.  - This is absolutely fair anger!  If the PM did not bother to scold the employee in due time, he simply did not give him the opportunity to improve and become better.  In fact, the PM simply ruined the potentially good and responsible employee! <br><br>  Project managers, take care of your subordinates!  They need your attention.  Praise them for their good work.  Scold for the bad. <br><br>  Dear developers!  If you do not hear any feedback about your work from the PMP, this is a very bad sign.  For some reason, your manager does not see your merits and your failures.  After all, there can be no such thing that by working on a project for months, you will not do anything good and nothing bad!  If you do not receive feedback from PMA, or if it is one-sided (you are only praised or just scolded), this is a dangerous situation.  Do not be lazy: ask your supervisor a question.  Let him answer, that he, first of all, does not like in your work, what worries him.  And already in the second, let him praise you and say that you do best.  Always make sure that you have objective and comprehensive information about the opinion of your supervisor about your work.  This will allow you to be sure that you are on the right path and that growth in the company is provided for you! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/166485/">https://habr.com/ru/post/166485/</a></p>
