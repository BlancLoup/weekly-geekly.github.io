You can not even find fault with the touchpad - a convenient and multi-touch.  However, almost immediately I began to look for a replacement for him - with the mouse I control much faster. <br><br>  It is worth making a small digression, having considered in brief the methods of connecting a mouse-type manipulator to mobile devices (actually, as well as to stationary ones), which are now more accessible.  I know of 2 options - through the wire (via USB) and without a wire (IR, Bluetooth and a radio channel).

      IR is more dead than alive.  The remaining connection methods require a separate USB port (for wire or for receiver), in case there is no built-in BT module.  And since he was in a laptop, he did not want to occupy the USB port twice (at least, because almost always all three ports are occupied - two flash drives and a WiMAX modem). <br><br>  The market analysis for Bluetooth mice began with Yaneks.Market.  Sprayed on the Genius, Defender and glamor Vaio did not - in the filter got only proven over the years Logitech, Microsoft and Razer.  Not a lot - only <a href="http://bit.ly/7GS049">13 models</a> (and if you remove duplicates, then generally 7) and at that time the choice fell on the new <b>Razer Pro | Click</b> .  I almost did not include <b>Microsoft Mobile Memory Mouse 8000</b> in the list of applicants, but, recalling its ergonomics from the <a href="http://boomburum.ru/2008/12/08/hit2008/">presentation</a> in 2008, I immediately changed my mind. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/6d7/0cb/e7d/6d70cbe7d1c956d43d1e5a65fd3b98d8.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Razer company specializes in gaming devices, but the roofing felts did well and there was confidence that it would turn off a piece of the pie from the market of ordinary users, roofing felts something else ... in short, Pro | Click turned out to be not very gaming) Small, wireless ( Bluetooth), with two buttons + a clickable wheel and ... everything!  No sensor sensor records (1200dpi), no other gadgets - THE MOST CONVENTIONAL MOUSE, at an affordable price. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/29b/9f2/9f8/29b9f29f80cb32db6edcd6d6a8dbaf1a.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  For quite a long time, it was she who was the first successful replacement of the touchpad and almost suited everything, but when I saw in the announcements of <b><a href="http://razerzone.ru/product/mouses/orochi/">Razer Orochi</a></b> , I realized that the days of Pro | Click are numbered.  P is <s>okay with the way the makuser will beat on every brainchild of Apple)</s> In general, I began to wait for new items.  And, damn it, wait! <br><br>  In the novelty, literally everything was bribed, starting with the opportunity to work on the wire and via Bluetooth, ending with an aggressive appearance. <br><br><h2>  Unboxing </h2><br>  The box is not as fancy as in the Razer Mamba ( <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/hardware/56677/">review</a> ). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/7ea/ff5/a95/7eaff5a9593265270d36db35613e8462.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  However, it will not be a shame to give such a person to anyone.  Inside the box neatly packed: <br><br>  - Mouse; <br>  - Case for mouse; <br>  - USB wire for it; <br>  - Two finger-type (AA) batteries; <br>  - Any paper and sticker. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/fd2/8fb/834/fd28fb83424fa409a8a317cc90deae5f.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Batteries - Energizer) While other manufacturers, if they put batteries in the kit (mostly to remotes), then this is usually some noname. <br>  The case is neoprene and inside is divided into two parts by a solid partition - the first is designed for the mouse itself, the second for the wire.  A nice bonus, considering that the mouse is ready to constantly travel with its owner. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/297/24d/10c/29724d10ce8050046189175b3bd78c1e.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The meter wire is solid, in a fabric braid, gilded at one end (damn, good to laugh, this is the key moment!))) Contact with the cap, at the other - microUSB. <br><br><h2>  Showroom </h2><br>  From the appearance of the very first gaming models, this rodent inherited almost nothing.  Small (99x68x35) hoof-like shape, in which there are both smooth shapes and sharp edges.  In sum, this gives a very attractive, memorable, aggressive appearance ‚Äî it is difficult to confuse with something. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/17b/92c/740/17b92c740624cf10b5340764d7ab7e54.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/bf2/da2/342/bf2da2342c2f0f79195a6e43faa001d5.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The undulating right and left buttons with the top black matte panel form a single unit.  The buttons are separated first by a slit (at the beginning of which there is a blue LED), then by a gap in which the scroll wheel is located.  It is plastic, with small teeth;  On the sides it contains two translucent rings, which also glow in the dark.  And already under the wheel is a connector for connecting the mouse via USB. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/916/cf5/f67/916cf5f67eb095aa51d1766bda098d25.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Almost the entire "perimeter" is made of gloss, but in practice only the sides get dirty.  On two buttons on each side - by default, the left are responsible for "back and forth", and the right for changing the sensitivity. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/d5d/9c5/c53/d5d9c5c5391f46314f388a6730e2f04b.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  All the "belly" of a rodent is just as fucking, something very similar to the back panel of the <b>HTC Diamond</b> Communicator - the same chaotic surface breaks.  In the corners are trapezoidal Teflon inserts (the company calls them <b>Ultraslick Teflon feet</b> ), providing excellent sliding on the surface.  In the center is the yellow eye of a third-generation vigilant laser sensor ( <b>Razer Precision 3G Laser sensor</b> ), which provides sensitivity up to 4000 dpi (in the case of a wired connection).  Behind the sensor is a two-way power switch. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/7c1/ae6/596/7c1ae659679a80b6b8e7633774fc1514.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/24e/2f1/dc1/24e2f1dc1fc7878b08f4bf5788cc89f8.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  There is a small gap on the back of the mouse - you can remove the cover by prying with your fingernail.  There are few other options - either insert batteries (to be able to connect via Bluetooth), or pull them out so that the mouse will feel better.  Closing the panel, two small magnets on the sides literally slap it. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/037/ba6/8a3/037ba68a317dfde2d967c760b6ac62a9.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/b50/b97/d4e/b50b97d4ead8bfef3fb0da51f00de14c.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h2>  3 ... 2 ... 1 ... GO! </h2><br>  The mouse fits comfortably in the hand, but its size is such that the bottom and side of the palm in any case will be on the table. <br>  The mouse can work without drivers (I don‚Äôt know how to use Linux, but Mac 10.4+ is supported), but it‚Äôs clear that it‚Äôs not in full force.  There are no problems with connecting via wire, however, as with BT.  We add a new device and hold down all the side buttons for 5 seconds - everything can be used.  But there are small differences in the work of the modes. <br><br>  For example, working through a wire, the resolution is 4000dpi and you can specify different polling frequencies of the port - 125, 500 or 1000Hz, which gives a delay of 8, 2 or 1 ms.  While the wireless connection is somewhat limited functionally - at least it is a delay of 8ms and a maximum sensitivity of 2000dpi.  Nevertheless, it is almost impossible to find such a delay with an inexperienced eye (divide a second into 1000 beats and take 8 of them - this is the kind of delay that you will have when working via Bluetooth) - even in games it is unlikely to interfere with anyone. <br><br>  In the settings window (drivers weigh about 25 MB) there are five tabs.  On the first one a mouse is drawn, where you can visually adjust its buttons for any actions - be it clicks, scrolls, sensitivity shifts, profiles, or something else. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/7cc/bc5/ef1/7ccbc5ef12e58f7042286da45a1fb97f.png" alt="image"><br><br>  The second tab is responsible for the sensitivity (125-4000dpi) and for the acceleration of the cursor.  You can adjust the number of steps and sensitivity levels when changing hardware buttons. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/76e/955/899/76e9558993168a07cf06c1db6b1c0189.png" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/46f/734/14f/46f73414f3b98ed33badf3d50cee59fa.png" alt="image"><br><br>  In this mouse is a ‚Äúlogbook‚Äù, or rather, the built-in memory of the Razer Synapse, which allows you to store various settings directly in the mouse.  Among them - the appointment of buttons, sensitivity, macros and so on.  All this is configured through the third software tab.  On the fourth, macros are actually - their creation is very similar to the Actions panel in Photoshop :) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/1e8/a31/35f/1e8a3135fc570bce7de8c7bcb344d786.png" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/920/7b6/cbb/9207b6cbbc473aac67f5c5a45d8607cd.png" alt="image"><br><br>  A small indicator, as I said, is lit in blue and red when the battery charge becomes less than 30%.  But if it bothers someone, its glow (and the wheels too) can also be turned off - on the fifth tab. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/1a5/f54/1c7/1a5f541c73df26ca9bfeb7e1c25e1d44.png" alt="image"><br><br>  I have already considered the software in more detail in the review of the Razer Mamba - since then almost nothing has changed, so if you are interested, refresh it in memory. <br><br>  Driving the mouse turned out to be a real pleasure - it slid perfectly over all the surfaces that I offered her, and she did it very quietly.  But she didn‚Äôt work at all :) For example, the glass table was too tough for her. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/b37/11f/7ee/b3711f7eeb8f54e83fd65820e1ff7b7b.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h2>  A couple of words about | click </h2><br>  I think that readers will not forgive me another review about the products of the Razer company;) Therefore, I will tell you about the <b>Razer pro | click</b> mouse, but very briefly. <br><br>  It is available in four colors - black, red, pink and white.  Black at that time was almost not available, so I had to be content with red.  It only works via Bluetooth - for this it is installed two finger batteries, under the removable panel. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/0db/af6/f76/0dbaf6f764308ff81bd5c846e6317950.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  On the lid, under the palm of your hand, there is a functional indicator - when it is covered by hand, it does not light up.  It is necessary to carry the hand and it begins to pulsate slowly, which helps to find the mouse in complete darkness (however, you can turn off the indicator for the safety of the batteries by holding down all the buttons at the same time).  In addition to the indicator, there are two buttons (right and left) + wheel (which can be pressed). <br>  At the bottom - a two-position switch and a connect button with a computer.  Connects without problems, works without additional software.  A sort of unisex rodent for an office laptop. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/07a/fcf/1ec/07afcf1eceb86d7ce56012e7af25e1f3.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>Cons</b> - glossy sides and poor performance on glossy and transparent surfaces - you had to carry a rug with you or put a magazine under it.  And I also constantly wanted the side buttons on the left for ‚Äúback and forth‚Äù in the browser and file manager. <br><br>  <b>Pros</b> - affordable price, minimalism, symmetrical shape and long battery life. <br><br>  By the way, once again about the origin of product names.  All acoustics are called fish and shark names, keyboards are called spiders, rugs are called beetles, and mice are called snakes.  So, for example, <b>Orochi</b> in ancient Japanese mythology, the mighty 8-headed demon snake, and <b>Mamba</b> - <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A7%25D1%2591%25D1%2580%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B0%25D1%258F_%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B1%25D0%25B0">one of the</a> most dangerous snakes in Africa. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/2ba/5af/0b8/2ba5af0b8ed457d493f525712bb942c2.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  In the near future, other new items will also be available for sale - the multi-button <b><a href="http://www.razerzone.com/gaming-mice/razer-naga/">Razer Naga</a></b> (the mythical Indian <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259D%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B3">snake half</a> <b><a href="http://www.razerzone.com/gaming-mice/razer-abyssus/">god</a></b> ), the budget <b><a href="http://www.razerzone.com/gaming-mice/razer-abyssus/">Razer Abyssus</a></b> (some kind of rattlesnake there) and the freshest <b><a href="http://www.razerzone.com/gaming-mice/razer-imperator/">Razer Imperator</a></b> (imperial boa).  An interesting job for marketers is to look for something on Wikipedia every time. And what will they do when the monsters run out?  Either dry the oars, or invent something else)) <br><br><h2>  Capture the flag </h2><br>  <u>The main composition</u> : <br>  - 6 buttons + wheel (with a click); <br>  - Ability to connect via wire and via Bluetooth; <br>  - Work on any surface and without any delays; <br>  - The memorable appearance, fine assembly and qualitative materials; <br>  - Debugged drivers, functional lights. <br><br>  <u>Allies</u> : <br>  - Modest size; <br>  - Rich equipment (cover included); <br>  - Not a purebred battery is used, but ordinary finger-type batteries; <br>  - Working through the wire, you can "regulate" the weight of a rodent by inserting and removing fuel cells :) <br>  - Fully symmetrical form - equally suitable for both right-handers and left-handers; <br>  - Built-in memory for profiles with different settings;  macros; <br>  - Ability to change the sensitivity of the sensor "on the fly"; <br><br>  <u>Opponents</u> : <br>  - Glossy sides; <br>  - No Bluetooth receiver included; <br>  - Does not work on transparent surfaces; <br>  - less universal microUSB - better miniUSB; <br>  - Elastic click wheel;  the wheel can not be tilted left and right; <br>  - The modest size is not suitable for a big hand; <br>  - The price is higher than the competition. <br><br>  <b>Hooray, our flag!</b>  <b>:)</b> <br><br>  In the minuses, I tried to dig to the maximum, but there is something to say about this.  For a large palm, any notebook mouse will be small.  Finding a laptop without BT is difficult now, so instead of a receiver, a wire is offered.  Even if you lose the wire, it will not be difficult to buy USB-microUSB, although everyone has USB-miniUSB.  It does not work on a glass table - yes, a frequent problem of many mice, but in this case the same Razer fired a wagon of all kinds of floor mats.  Elastic click wheel someone like, but not me;  but for the "right-left" I would say a special thank you.  Gloss yes, bue.  As for the gloss and the wheel, a friend said ‚Äúswing my hands‚Äù) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/986/5d6/dcc/9865d6dccf0f6e22fb5e03480b7b1447.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h2>  Credits </h2><br>  Many thanks to Alexey P. for the overseas gift - in our cold edges the mouse will begin to be sold somewhere from the middle of December.  At what price?  It is authentically known that the surcharge will start from the figure of <b>$ 79.99</b> , but its size will depend only on the greed of local sellers.  Yandex.market in a single store <a href="">gives the</a> figure of 3500 rubles, however, there is no product in stock yet. <br><br><h2>  Happy end </h2><br>  Previously, the company Razer did products on the principle of "Rarely, but aptly," but now they are often - really there are so many gamers?  ) It is unlikely - probably the products are taken and ordinary buyers.  However, the frequency of new products does not affect their high quality.  But literally about each device, at the time of release, we can say that it is special - in each there is some kind of zest.  Agree, it is better than stamping clones of faceless devices that are no different from analogs.  Although there will always be those who openly say " <i>Razer makes cheap Chinese toys for schoolchildren</i> " and, gritting his teeth, " <i>I'd rather buy a mouse for 150 rubles - it will be no worse</i> ." <br><br>  If you feel fine with the touchpad, then you probably do not need a mouse.  If you are still reading, then apparently you are not indifferent to the question.  The price will be in any case higher than that of competitors (although it is comparable to the prices of the same VX Nano at the time of its release, so it is still a matter of time) - whether this money is worth all that this mouse offers, everyone decides for himself yourself  And again, good things are not cheap. <br><br>  New Orochi is not so much for games, but for a laptop.  For games, it seems to me, full-size models are more suitable (although if taken on the road, less load is preferable).  Otherwise, the novelty is definitely a success - there are many advantages in it, and it is quite possible to get along with the minuses.  This is the mouse that I really dreamed of, love at first sight did not turn into disappointment, quite the contrary - my choice will be unshakeable in the near future) And with a glossy surface, I will try to think of something. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/6a0/696/8ad/6a06968ad67c4af7a9f51b3e878164a2.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  There lies a mouse in front of me and says: ‚Äú <i>Well, don't finish the article, write something else about me.</i>  <i>Well, at least on <a href="http://twitter.com/Boomburum">Twitter</a> , eh?</i>  ":) <br><br>  <b>Successes!</b> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/76623/">https://habr.com/ru/post/76623/</a></p>
