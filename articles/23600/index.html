      Piglet sniffed the picture and loudly sank. <br><br>  - Owl, it is from the burdock!  The piglet exclaimed with displeasure, rubbing his prickly nose. <br>  - A-aah!  - good-naturedly stretched Owl.  This picture is called "Donkey Eey sad". <br>  - And where is Ee here? <br>  - He is sad.  - Owl said morally.  - He is sad elsewhere.  Where there is no burdock.  And so he is sad. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Winnie the Pooh sipped from a keg and cleared his throat. <br><br>  - You see, Piglet!  This is modern painting!  Sovangard!  This should not be understood head filled with sawdust! <br>  - Yes?  - the pig noticeably relaxed.  - And what's that?  Winnie got into a swarm of bees? <br><br>  Piglet showed a black and yellow mess, in the middle of which one open, alert eye was clearly visible.  The bear cub looked questioningly at the Owl. <br><br>  - This is a portrait of the Tigers!  - Owl said proudly. <br><br>  Piglet walked around the picture from all sides. <br><br>  ‚ÄúNot very similar,‚Äù he said doubtfully. <br>  - Do not be primitive, Pyatachello!  - Winnie again kissed the keg.  - do you see the tiger?  Not.  And he is.  So I saw the Owl.  She's an artist, you know? <br>  - Yes!  - the sleeping Owl was startled.  I see it, yes! <br>  - Especially at night?  - said Piglet, but the Owl had already closed her eyes. <br><br>  The following picture was something unintelligible - green squares were scattered on a pink background. <br><br>  - Owl, what is it?  Ham with pistachios?  - Winnie laughed.  Piglet frowned. <br>  - Wow!  Right!  This is a portrait of Piglet!  Only not with pistachios, but with acorns!  - The owl rolled with laughter, until suddenly she felt something solid in the back area. <br><br>  On closer inspection, this turned out to be a hoof.  Donkey Eey carefully sniffed the burdock canvas, simultaneously pressing the artist's wing to the ground. <br><br>  - So it means - Ia tsedil words through strong teeth - Donkey Eey sad?  I am sad?  Tiger!  - the donkey raised his voice, and behind him a black and yellow mess with two evil eyes formed silently. <br><br>  - Tigra, this lack of talent is not enough that calls itself an artist, she also puts us all to ridicule!  The donkey turned to Tigre and the Owl fluttered to the branch, losing a few feathers. <br><br>  Tiger growled. <br><br>  - Lumpen!  - Owl squealed from the branch.  - Imblya!  They would!  Imbeciles!  Should I really listen to criticism ?!  And from whom?  From green squares and heaps of burdock!  Satraps! <br>  - Donkey Eeyas is having fun!  - Yeah shouted in response and knocked down a tripod.  Donkey Eey rejoices!  - on the ground flew a coffee table.  Donkey Eeyore happy!  - he was joined by Tigra. <br><br>  - Come on, Piglet.  There will be nothing more interesting here.  - Winnie the Pooh turned his back to the defeat.  - Donkey in a rage - worse than a bulldozer, I always said that. <br>  - Winnie, Winnie, - Piglet was minced for a bear cub, irresistible in a checkered green dresser.  - Why didn't the Owl draw your portrait? <br><br>  Winnie the Pooh silently snuffled until they entered the house with a sign "I AM AND A RATING".  Below, it was smaller: "Outsiders, na!". <br><br>  Winnie threw the lid of the laptop, and referring to some piece of paper, typed a large headline: "GYNITIC NUCLEAR RESPONSIBILITY OF WAYDLE FOR ART" <br><br>  <a href="http://chmyrnovich.livejournal.com/">(c) chmyrnovich</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/23600/">https://habr.com/ru/post/23600/</a></p>
