Nevertheless, initially this feature was used in the budget segment models, bypassing more functional devices. <br><br>  Over time, the scenarios of using two SIM cards in one device increasingly shifted from direct savings to the possibility of using corporate and personal cards at the same time, without worrying about the need to purchase a second device.  In addition, the place of the service "sims" on vacation is easily taken by the local operator card, allowing you not to limit yourself in spending on the mobile Internet and share your impressions with the world. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/5d0/499/a5a/5d0499a5a779c986cac75a661ea1dfad.jpg">

    <a name="habracut"></a><br>  Of course, this requires the appropriate hardware, and today no one will be surprised by the middle and high-end devices equipped with two SIM slots.  Another thing is that not everyone can boast of an excellent user interface, a modern quad-core processor on a new platform, and most importantly, the simultaneous operation of both cards! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/54f/8e4/de5/54f8e4de5975e80285e4037725205345.jpg"><br><br>  Most of the ‚Äúdvuhsimochnyh‚Äù solutions that are present on the market, equipped with a single radio module, and in the implementation of a conversation on one line, your second number will automatically become unavailable.  As a rule, this restriction is imposed by the platform used. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/57a/d2a/80c/57ad2a80c9fe560c3ca2da9b17271358.jpg"><br><br>  The innovation of the NTS company - the Desire 600 dual sim smartphone is equipped with two radio modules, which allows the owner of such a device to stay connected constantly.  Even if you are talking on one of the selected lines, the second one will be available for receiving SMS and other activity, which will allow not to miss a single important message or news. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/0c0/0f1/3ef/0c00f13ef27d8677ce889ec4ed6e60a0.jpg"><br><br>  With all this, the device is quite light and compact, and about multimedia functions when creating it, too, have not been forgotten.  As befits a new smartphone from the NTS, the Desire 600 is controlled through the new Sense 5 interface running on top of Android 4.1.2.  Everything, as in the new flagship One, only in a more compact package and a slightly different design. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/550/52c/ff4/55052cff46475b458be1a38cfd90720f.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/8bc/572/3cd/8bc5723cd9ad2ee062f74d821eac85c9.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/da2/ecc/436/da2ecc436b5a259b1917a841f0ec7701.png"><br><br>  It features a customizable news feed BlinkFeed, automatically gathering content from social networks and selected news portals, familiar desktops, great widgets and proprietary animations. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/515/b02/930/515b02930efe682d3993fa655384720e.jpg"><br><br>  The "iron" part did not let us down.  The device is based on SoC Qualcomm Snapdragon 200, and the CPU operates at frequencies up to 1.2 GHz.  RAM - one gigabyte, and 8 GB of storage are allocated for data storage, of which about five are available to the user.  Do not be in a hurry to get upset when you see a relatively small value - support for microSD memory cards has not gone away, so the storage space expands to 64 GB without any problems! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/726/9fb/8b7/7269fb8b7ee6905a00d35ac3b8435848.jpg"><br><br>  The display is made by proprietary technology Super LCD2, which guarantees excellent viewing angles and good readability in the sun.  The screen resolution is 960x540 pixels, and the Adreno 203 accelerator is responsible for outputting a three-dimensional image. It should be noted that the device copes with modern games perfectly.  Hits like Mass Effect: Infiltrator and Need for Speed: Most Wanted allowed you to have a great time, and if the selected game supports control from an external gamepad, the Desire 600 turns into a mobile gaming station! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/688/585/937/68858593740741c57f770a831a426380.jpg"><br><br>  For fans of exact numbers, we tested the phone in popular benchmarks, the results are presented in the screenshots. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/a87/613/fb9/a87613fb90126b6c9aa2f6b5bbd40bb2.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/aab/d32/4ec/aabd324ecdcb0ccb7886fc28927f9afc.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/a28/718/c29/a28718c291603579fe7a9e0b63e9ac57.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/707/145/d43/707145d431bd45c5a8d8b16828591aab.png"><br><br>  Contrary to the trends emerging in the market, the smartphone battery is removable, and access to the battery and slots is quite simple - you just need to pry the back cover in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe upper end and hold around the perimeter.  Your attention will appear gorgeous decorated back panel of fiery red color (just like in Desire C, by the way).  All available interfaces are signed and clearly marked, so that it would not be possible to make a mistake for good reason. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/585/787/6d7/5857876d7508d6ed500b3fa7c03d9800.jpg"><br><br>  On the left is the first SIM card slot.  It is he who supports data transmission in third-generation networks, so it is better to save the SIM card for voice traffic for the second slot located next door.  On the right - a compartment for a memory card, everything is standard here.  It should be borne in mind that if the cards are inserted incorrectly or incompletely (‚Äúnot completely‚Äù), the back panel will not fully snap into place in the corresponding slots, making it clear what is inside there, what to pay attention to. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/42c/b18/67f/42cb1867f9314a631ab67dd1f5babcd6.jpg"><br><br>  Despite the presence of removable parts, the build quality of the device can only be described as ‚Äúexcellent‚Äù.  The case does not creak and does not play, even when targeted, and the phone itself gives the impression of a well-tailored and tightly-linked device. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/8e7/5a4/f9b/8e75a4f9bf79fb3833ee4eac9d272c3d.jpg"><br><br>  The device dimensions are 134.8 x 67.0 x 9.3 mm, and the smartphone weighs only 130 grams.  The ends can not boast an abundance of functional elements, but everything you need is available.  On the right - the familiar "rocker" volume control, easily groped during a conversation.  On top - the power button and 3.5 mm audio jack.  At the bottom you can find the microphone hole and microUSB connector, no surprises. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/7ea/aa3/283/7eaaa32833f822ae1ed3b944b700c538.jpg"><br><br>  But some interest is the front panel.  After all, in addition to the display and unobtrusive "eye" of the front camera, there are two stereo speakers.  The conclusion is obvious - the model belongs to the proud family of smartphones with the support of the proprietary technology HTC BoomSound, which means you are guaranteed not to miss an important call, and any entertainment may well be a reason for a pleasant surprise! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/f7b/6f9/bd4/f7b6f9bd45d8b897a825cbdf1d100dfe.jpg"><br><br>  If you get distracted from the device and let it go for a minute, you will immediately notice a stylish set of accessories, perfectly in tune with the Desire 600 in white.  The standard package includes: a cable for synchronization and charging, an adapter for a network charger, as well as a headset with earplugs and a set of attachments.  Of course, all the necessary documentation is also present. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/d94/62b/ea1/d9462bea1b18b617aac58026e3fd6ba0.jpg"><br><br>  However, the phone is so intuitive that in the process of initial configuration and subsequent operation, most users are unlikely to have to refer to the instructions.  By the way, it is not necessary to fill in all the fields "from scratch".  At your service is the NTS corporate service for remote phone setup, previously available only for flagship models.  Just go to <a href="https://start.htcsense.com/">HTC Sense</a> and comfortably enter your credentials.  In addition, no one forbids to express freedom of expression during personalization, install a set of basic programs in addition to those already present on the device and simply transfer all data to the phone by connecting it to a wireless network. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/71a/8b1/dff/71a8b1dff2ab55279a5e934edf9de141.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/9b7/165/1bb/9b71651bb3cdcdf73e4b83fd212cb1c8.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/b67/396/f32/b67396f32e034c734a790702a1ec02aa.png"><br><br>  Also available are options to restore from previously made backups, transfer from devices from other manufacturers and much more.  In short, the NTS is doing everything so that the new phone becomes ‚Äúnative‚Äù as quickly as possible, allowing you to use the device for its intended purpose, and not to plunge into the wilds of settings. <br><br>  As was to be expected, close attention is paid to the functioning and collaboration of two SIM-cards.  Companies are not the first to release ‚Äúdual-purpose‚Äù devices, and the convenient separation of the call sending key on the dialer screen is already a familiar, albeit a pleasant trifle.  Also, the owners of Desire V or Desire SV should be familiar with a clear indication of calls and messages sent from one or another ‚Äúcard‚Äù. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/ba8/ad0/1c9/ba8ad01c997c11ba493484fd105b829f.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/5ce/30d/4e3/5ce30d4e3f4b8907e6df18e71d176afc.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/595/d06/f9f/595d06f9f2c82983f1a0a818abb5fe07.png"><br><br>  To bring the appearance of the buttons when working with SMS-messages in accordance with their aesthetic needs, it will take very little time.  The device allows you to rename the slots as you like, adhering to this system in all modes, one way or another exploiting the separation of data by "sim cards".  The preferred network is the default operator, whose SIM-card is placed in the first slot, but this situation is easy to change. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/55c/4ac/998/55c4ac9982eed70e94e91583115b25ac.jpg"><br><br>  In addition, accounting of traffic, voice calls and sent messages is clearly and correctly recorded in a special section "Use".  Not every smartphone boasts such a presentation, and in most cases, fans of statistics have to install additional programs that do not differ in special grace. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/c6a/7fb/4e4/c6a7fb4e4ce1fb25bca301e6b312435e.jpg"><br><br>  Here, everything is organically inscribed in the interface, clearly presented, and most importantly - allows to draw conclusions about the intensity of the use of the phone for its intended purpose.  It cannot be ruled out that according to the results of the analysis, the user will make a decision on switching to a different tariff, reducing communication costs and receiving a direct benefit in the future. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/5ce/30d/4e3/5ce30d4e3f4b8907e6df18e71d176afc.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/595/d06/f9f/595d06f9f2c82983f1a0a818abb5fe07.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/bef/b29/709/befb29709f5fa3adc2f1322b987c170e.png"><br><br>  While the time of far-reaching conclusions has not yet come, you can enjoy what is being offered right now.  In particular, this is an informative news feed BlinkFeed, easily scrolled to the beginning by double clicking on the status bar, as well as the excellent HTC Share service.  Like the flagship model, the Desire 600 is able to independently assemble interesting videos, combining your photos and videos into a real movie with great music and original effects.  So that the created masterpiece could be appreciated by all, it suffices to upload the video to the NTS servers and share the link. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/c82/bac/b3c/c82bacb3c1436512a011484000ed32c0.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/659/754/bed/659754bed244686859039cacc1201f65.png"><br><br>  Initial data, as usual, are drawn from the outside world, and the built-in camera will definitely help us in this.  The application interface has been updated, but the resolution remains traditional - 8 megapixels.  Of course, Desire 600 can record video as 720p at up to 30 frames per second.  Video encoding is the responsibility of the ImageChip image processor.  Exactly the same is true for the front camera, which supports including HDR photography. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/d4a/e42/6ba/d4ae426ba816afa79ce0e41a407f5cbf.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/81a/46b/0a4/81a46b0a495bb969159b18a5bc67bb55.png"><br><br>  As in previous models, there is a slow motion with a reduced output resolution.  Moreover, in the process of shooting, the recording speed can change, allowing you to correctly place accents and draw the viewer's attention to the nuances of what is happening. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/7f8/c48/2fd/7f8c482fd811ff618ebaede725a4fd21.jpg"><br><br>  We attach examples of clips obtained using various shooting modes: <br><ul><li>  <a href="http://youtu.be/4vDeWlPx1G8">Main camera, HD quality</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://youtu.be/UkBWCzwMP_g">Main camera, slow motion</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://youtu.be/530Nss6DPw4">Front-camera</a> </li></ul><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/ab4/f40/a45/ab4f40a4598d563db48eae3c1f92ea13.jpg"><br><br>  In the standard Gallery application, the Event view is of particular interest.  The device will independently order all your activity by shooting dates, displaying also data on the location of the taken pictures.  As usual, no one bothers to return to the standard ‚ÄúAlbums‚Äù by simultaneously connecting cloud storages to view images stored on remote servers. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/4ed/f65/3e0/4edf653e0a1cbbc85e17fb974495231e.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/3f3/e49/08a/3f3e4908a3d3ebccf7e9ba3cdbc1d975.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/bb6/3b8/9cd/bb63b89cddf33154b21dbb215ea6ecc4.png"><br><br>  In the asset of the camera, as it is now accepted, the HDR mode, as well as panoramic shooting, the test results of which were initially forced to literally "precipitate".  With all our desire, we could not find a single fragment on which the ‚Äúgluing‚Äù of the image would be clearly visible.  We think that the time has come to offer you to familiarize yourself with the examples of images yourself.  Of course, there were some HDR images, landscape photos, macro photographs and a couple of panoramas. <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/a90/168/f74/a90168f745511ab7ee0df6b193384d6f.jpg"></a> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/6aa/fcc/848/6aafcc8484c5ef5988470bf451659129.jpg"></a> <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/037/d75/a9b/037d75a9b2a3521de4cc7a38ad366b65.jpg"></a> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/bc1/11a/437/bc111a4373b9c75c3576f651ba38cfe4.jpg"></a> <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/fae/70b/3e8/fae70b3e801c6c9041f44ae90b29ea13.jpg"></a> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/49c/078/3dd/49c0783dda02bebb5ec2e462913dae25.jpg"></a> <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/6d5/7b7/f53/6d57b7f534fee8c9c1974b28c0863908.jpg"></a> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/02b/126/c0d/02b126c0dd52f7b23cb946998ce04425.jpg"></a> <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/612/b89/2bd/612b892bd6809e84f0395eb9689c5236.jpg"></a> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/758/a38/926/758a38926736370c0bf309bda46f80d7.jpg"></a> <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/8f3/389/996/8f33899969d38c0c13ea36abcb2f237b.jpg"></a> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/61e/526/5f9/61e5265f91f880d4b6ee1e1d885da555.jpg"></a> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/8a3/a66/8c0/8a3a668c0bb3c7b6dc5497645c7f1842.jpg"></a> <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/943/952/9e3/9439529e35f57fa0709f4d444626e715.jpg"></a> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/195/57a/b97/19557ab97e16923c2eda20fd25c71984.jpg"></a> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/6ad/749/613/6ad749613db4b788d2ee460930b4b02d.jpg"></a> <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/1ba/f50/5b5/1baf505b56609546fee152ca21a4f27c.jpg"></a> <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/7f8/f7d/09e/7f8f7d09e1aa22cb78770099bc6e807f.jpg"></a> <br><br>  The multimedia component, as before, is represented by the pre-installed client TuneIn Radio and SoundHound, which work well in tandem with the proprietary music player NTS.  The sound is subjected to proprietary processing using the Beats Audio algorithm, so that the results "at the output" should not disappoint you. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/b8c/2ee/001/b8c2ee00114674ee7e275fb119ff613c.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/5dd/5d3/113/5dd5d3113ea2154f81e777e2b694e737.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/279/d47/6d6/279d476d6cc9a7daa671cddb1f05b997.png"><br><br>  All this, of course, is wonderful, but how is the novelty with autonomy?  The new platform, two active SIM-cards and much more - whether these measures will not lead to disastrous results?  Not at all!  The charger can be safely forgotten at home, and until the end of the day, no matter how long it is, the battery life is enough. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/2f3/f5e/42a/2f3f5e42a8266757bfb2aced0a2a8a8a.jpg"><br><br>  At the same time, about ten accounts were included and regularly synchronized, including three email accounts (Gmail, Outlook.com and IMAP working).
