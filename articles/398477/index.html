The consumer needs not only the means of production that we talked about last time.  The most effective is the collection of funds for those projects that are necessary to improve human activity - for example, various accessories. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Among them, most often there are a variety of add-ons for Apple products.  Interestingly, several similar projects can coexist and efficiently recruit a budget. <br><br>  Thus, the appearance of the iPhone 7 line, the panic associated with the only physical interface, gave rise to the heap of adapters, headsets, and even cases with Lightning.  Interestingly, accessories for Apple gadgets almost always collect the necessary sums, and after that they come to regular online stores.

    <h3>  Wizician - Lightning on the wire </h3><br>  So, someone <b><a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/anayarina/dac-amplifier-audio-and-charge-adapter-for-ios-dev/creator_bio">Ana Yarina</a></b> offered her vision of a universal adapter with Lightning connectors (and even two in the Plus version) and 3.5-millimeters in the form of a small cylinder on a wire (the form itself is very important) called the <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/anayarina/dac-amplifier-audio-and-charge-adapter-for-ios-dev">Wizician</a> .  Not only interfaces hide in the cylinder, but also a 60 mW amplifier with a DAC. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/39b/3b1/508/39b3b150812341d8ae8005365e0aa764.jpg"><br><br>  On the cylinder there are three buttons on which you can hang as many as 14 actions.  But only the wire is short.  The design is reminiscent of branded adapters that came bundled with Samsung Corby for using ordinary headphones with a proprietary connector from the company.  But he had a length of about 40 cm, and it was enough from pocket to neck, where it was convenient to operate the buttons. <br><br>  In the case of the <b>Wizician, the</b> length is enough only for more or less convenient placement in your pocket.  Wire, kinks - the life of the device will be short.  The quality of decoding and amplification, the developer indicates without describing the type of chips - is also an interesting point. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/212/131/cbd/212131cbd5914d7abbcf2e2da8324c63.jpg"><br><br>  Right now, an adapter that allows you to simultaneously charge a gadget and listen to music from a familiar minijack costs $ 40.  And he is clearly not gaining enough.  Until.  But be sure to pick up, because it uses an interesting life hack.  (In addition, the girl already has one realized product and a partnership announcement of production, and the required amount by the standards of the site is insignificant.) <br><br>  The fact is that now on the site - three similar devices.  One of them has already taken place, and in the near future the fundraising for it will end.  There will be a short break between the possibility of ordering Kickstarter and pre-ordering from the manufacturer - and here those who want to get a ‚Äúsmart‚Äù device from the crowdfunding platform will purchase a less convenient <b>Wizician</b> . <br><br><h3>  Auxillite - stand with adapter </h3><br>  Unless the previous project burned out due to the close proximity of an adapter called <b><a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1478028788/auxillite-lightest-2-in-1-dac-converter-for-your-i">Auxillite</a></b> from the same <a href="http://www.auxillite.com/">team of developers</a> . <br><br>  One more peculiar variant of such a necessary adapter: a cylinder fastened with a wall.  At one end - Lightning-port, on the second - minijack.  About any audiophile pribluda speech is not.  But the cost forces buyers to choose this particular project: $ 9 is not money yet. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a12/386/ef1/a12386ef17b04c8f8fe06469023f47c3.png"><br><br>  Of interest is the improved version of Auxillite in which the body-cylinder turns into the hinge of the stand.  It is not very clear how the necessary structural strength will be created, but the idea is very well funded, and can be implemented as soon as possible. <br><br><h3>  iLDOCK - when time is most important </h3><br>  The easiest of existing Kickstarter adapters for the new iPhone.  Appearing almost simultaneously with the release of the device, the project of the <a href="http://www.ildock.com/">iLDockgear</a> team managed to enlist the support of the media and raise 35 more funds than is necessary for the launch. <br><br>  In the end, three factors played a key role: <br><br><ol><li>  instant reaction to the appeared niche; </li><li>  release in several variants (and, at the moment, the company can effectively distribute production capacity when fulfilling an order, and postpone the most difficult or unpopular ones); </li><li>  low cost - at the start <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/291423994/ildock-charge-and-listen-to-iphone-7-at-the-same-t">iLDOCK</a> cost only 5 (!!!) dollars. </li></ol><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c4c/6ac/627/c4c6ac6272844d84a31555ad94c7a8a7.jpg"><br><br>  At the same time, the project is quite dimensional - at least, it looks more massive in comparison with competitors.  It sticks out of the iLDOCK phone further than its competitors, and does not have ANY streamlining - just a piece of plastic sticking out of the connector.  Competitors more convenient.  But the freebie and speed - decide.  And not unique, convenient products win - and those that appeared earlier. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/398477/">https://habr.com/ru/post/398477/</a></p>
