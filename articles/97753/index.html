  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Official opening BitByBit</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Good day, dear comrades! <br><br> <a href="http://bitbybit.ru/"><img src="http://bitbybit.ru/content/images/background/bg_logo.gif" alt="image"></a> <br><br>  We are glad to <a href="http://bitbybit.ru/">bring</a> to your attention the <a href="http://bitbybit.ru/">BitByBit</a> project, a system for accumulating knowledge and sharing experience between programmers.  Yes, there is already far from one portal inviting developers to publish on its Internet space.  Unfortunately, among them very few people can boast of something new.  At 90% - this is not very successful "habr-clones."  We hope that <a href="http://bitbybit.ru/">BitByBit is</a> not one of them. <br>  We had no desire to create a site for the sake of the site.  We wanted our project to fix still existing problems.  Here are some of them. 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"

    <a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  Tree rating </h4><br>  The first problem that worried us a lot is an adequate assessment of the user's actions.  At one time, the Habr ratings were, perhaps, innovative for Runet.  But today, this is not enough for us - we would like to see ‚Äúat the top of Olympus‚Äù just professionals, and not those who have a good sense of humor or lovers of publishing news about new hardware.  So that it is possible to separate the specialists in the language of Hell from the typesetting specialists.  Therefore, in the framework of BitByBit, we have created a tree rating.  Of course, there is still a lot of work to be done on the coefficients and formulas, and the pitfalls are not all eliminated, but the main thing we have done is that the users' work will be evaluated with the accuracy of a programming language, and somewhere else with the accuracy of a framework or library. <br><br><h4>  Interaction between programmers </h4><br>  The second problem is the search for the necessary information in programming.  The first assistant is, of course, google.  He usually sends us to some forum - it is especially sad here when we get to the page with our question, but the answer to it is ‚Äúthe question has already been raised, use the forum search.‚Äù  But someone initially asked questions on the forums and asks so far ... It seems to us that the forums, from a technological point of view, are getting rid of their age.  As a more modern alternative, we offer a <a href="http://bitbybit.ru/question">question and answer system</a> . <br>  Sometimes it happens that you need information that does not fit into a small answer to a question, but requires the presence of a full-fledged publication.  We came up with such a section as <a href="http://bitbybit.ru/crequest">‚Äúcontent by request‚Äù</a> - any of the users can indicate what they would like to read, while the rich with experience can immediately see what knowledge is in demand. <br><br><h4>  Knowledge structuring </h4><br>  The third problem is the lack of any normal structuring of knowledge.  There are many publications on most of those topics, but in such a way that it is already more difficult to read systematically.  We have introduced on our site such a section as <a href="http://bitbybit.ru/tutorials">"self-help books"</a> .  It is not necessary to explain what self-study books are, in fact, we divide each language into topics for which, in turn, lessons can be added.  Here we have, of course, not without problems, many of the languages ‚Äã‚Äãwe have not yet divided into topics, but each of the users can offer their own, so we hope for your support. <br>  We structure not only regular publications, but also ready-made plugins, libraries and other ready-made pieces of code.  Especially for this, we have introduced the <a href="http://bitbybit.ru/solutions">ready-made solutions</a> section - of course, you can‚Äôt say anything special about it, but we are sure that it will be in demand too. <br><br><h4>  About the work done and the work ahead </h4><br>  We have been working on the project for a very long time.  Of course, we could cope much faster, but we need to understand that we are doing the project on our own, without any financing.  And that means - in his free time from work, family and study.  Nevertheless, we like what we have already done, and even more we like what remains to be done - there are many new interesting modules ahead of which even those who will have to allow users to make money on the portal are ahead.  But we do not forget about the ‚Äúwork on the mistakes‚Äù - so, in the framework of the test mode, we managed to eliminate about 800 shortcomings and are ready to eliminate those that you will soon find.  So, welcome to <a href="http://bitbybit.ru/">our project</a> and let's make the system better and better, bit by bit! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/97753/">https://habr.com/ru/post/97753/</a></p>
