      I, in turn, hope to get rich (or find reckless magnates and figure out the fonic) until 2019 (it will be 100 years from the date of patenting a jetpack) and stir up the turbojet technology competition. <br><br>  I dug up materials on contests for a series of articles, today a retrospective and a couple of little-known projects, the next publication will be about XPrize, then separately about the DARPA contests, and, possibly, IARPA. <br><br>  <i>(By the way, even on here, on Habr√©, there is a member of Google Lunar X PRIZE - <a href="https://habr.com/users/4110/" class="user_link">4110</a> )</i> <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h3>  1714 </h3><br>  <b>Longitude <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longitude_rewards">bonus</a> ( <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longitude_rewards">longitude rewards</a> )</b> <br><br>  Navigators faced with one "problem" - they could not determine the geographical longitude.  Determining latitude is simple, by measuring the elevation angle of the Polar Star above the horizon.  But to accurately determine the longitude for a long time was impossible.  Mistakes led to the loss of ships, people and goods.  The leading maritime powers ‚Äî Spain, Portugal, Holland, France, and the United Kingdom ‚Äî established serious prizes for solving the problem. <br><br>  It is said that in 1567 the Spanish king Philip II instituted a prize, then in 1598 Philip III promised 6000 ducats.  A little later, the States General (Netherlands) promised 10,000 florins for a solution. <br><br>  In 1675, Robert Hooke tried to fuck ¬£ 1,000 from the government of England for inventing spring clocks. <br><br>  But nobody got the money, so "it does not count." <br><br>  In 1714, the British Parliament established a special award for developing a method for determining longitude.  The amount was fantastic at that time - 10,000 pounds (¬£ 1.45 million by today's standards) with an error of 60 nautical miles, 15,000 pounds (40 miles) and 20,000 pounds.  In order to determine the longitude with such accuracy during the voyage to the West Indies, hours with an average daily departure of no more than three seconds were required (even though the watches at that time were considered particularly accurate if they had a minute hand). <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/133/68a/a78/13368aa78ccc1b0f267f2afa57c69ce9.jpg" alt="image"></div><br><br>  <i>In 1728, a carpenter and self-taught watchmaker <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Harrison">John Harrison</a> joined the competition.</i>  <i>He studied ship rolling for a couple of years and by 1735 finished the H1 watch.</i> <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/9b8/148/8d4/9b81488d413e4cedf85822eb289dc841.jpg" alt="image"></div><br><br>  <i>Huge and heavy (almost 40 kg) pendulum clock with an average daily departure of eight seconds showed an error of 150 miles longitude after sailing from London to Lisbon and back.</i> <br><br>  Similar results were shown in 1741 by the model H2.  In 1749, the H3 model came to light, where Harrison applied a bimetallic plate in a pendulum for temperature compensation and cardan suspension to compensate for rolling.  This watch was more accurate at sea than any other on land: the average daily departure was less than two seconds, and after 45 days of sailing, the accuracy of determining longitude was only 10 miles.  However, by that time, the parliament had changed the conditions of the competition - now it required not only accuracy, but also compactness. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ca7/a0e/b04/ca7a0eb04aed016320f661bbe65afa7d.jpg" alt="image"></div><br><br>  <i>Harrison in 1760 introduced a new model, the H4, - no longer pendulum, but with balance.</i> <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/2eb/250/7bb/2eb2507bb43e1a6d3eb6b6358f158477.jpg" alt="image"></div><br><br>  <i>Captain <s>Jack Sparrow</s> James Cook used the K1 - ‚Äúreplica‚Äù H4.</i> <br><br>  The clock had a diameter of 12 centimeters and was checked during two voyages to the West Indies - in 1761 and 1764, the departure at the same time was five seconds for the three months of travel.  But after that, the parliament was not in a hurry to pay the money.  The fact is that in 1757, a British naval officer, John Campbell, developed the design of a sextant - a tool for measuring the angular distances between celestial bodies.  Parliament hoped that using the tables of the Royal Observatory and the Werner method, the longitude could be calculated ‚Äúfor free‚Äù (Campbell was in the royal military service, and the prize was not meant for him).  Harrison watches were more convenient, and in the end in March 1776 - to his 83rd birthday - he was paid a deserved prize.  Other Longitude Award Winners are unknown. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/97d/07f/383/97d07f383e84753eb8877cf0555cc195.jpg" alt="image"></div><br><br><h3>  1795 </h3><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/98f/766/111/98f76611165b10430a58794f8a7cd363.jpg" alt="image"></div><br><br>  In 1795, Napoleon announced a reward of 12,000 francs to the one who thought out how to store food for as long as possible. <br><br>  In May 1809, French cook <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicolas_Appert">Nicolas Upper,</a> after 15 years of experience, sent a letter to the Minister of the Interior, in which he proposed a new way of preserving food.  Instead of salting and drying used up to that time, Upper used a conservation method that seemed to him similar to the storage of wine.  In 1810, Napoleon personally paid the prize to Nicolas Apper and ordered the quartermaster service to adopt the ‚Äúappertization‚Äù process.  The conservation method developed by Upper was that the preserved product was heated without oxygen to a temperature of 110-130 degrees Celsius.  This made it possible to significantly extend the life of the products.  Subsequently, the method of conservation of Uppert was improved due to the appearance of cans and the invention of pasteurization. <br><br><h3>  1900 </h3><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/205/a9c/ef2/205a9cef2b292717d3a3d5f11f425ae6.jpg" alt="image"></div><br><br>  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henri_Deutsch_de_la_Meurthe">Henri Deutsch de la Mert</a> (‚ÄúThe Oil King of Europe‚Äù) - a French ‚Äúoilman‚Äù and philanthropist, sponsored several competitions to speed up the development of aviation. <br><br>  In 1900, he announced a prize of 100 thousand francs ( <b>Deutsch de la Meurthe prize</b> ) to anyone who could fly an airship or airplane by flying 11 km from Saint-Claude‚Äôs park to the Eiffel Tower and return to the starting point in less than 30 minutes. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c95/897/137/c958971379b705735d6d317d0fcc5779.jpg" alt="image"></div><br><br>  <i>Alberto Santos-Dumont, son of the coffee king, aviation pioneer.</i> <br><br>  In July 1901, <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A1%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BD%25D1%2582%25D0%25BE%25D1%2581-%25D0%2594%25D1%258E%25D0%25BC%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BD,_%25D0%2590%25D0%25BB%25D1%258C%25D0%25B1%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580%25D1%2582%25D0%25BE">Santos-Dumont</a> joined the battle for the prize in his airship No. 5. The balloon rose into the air, but, rounding the tower, stopped as the engine stalled, and was carried by the wind to the park.  During the second attempt in August of the same year, a hydrogen leak occurred on the airship.  The airship began to decline sharply and collided with the roof of the Trocadero Hotel.  There was a powerful explosion.  Santos Dumont hung on the keel of his airship and was shot by firefighters.  On the same day, August 8, Santos-Dumont began to develop plans for the construction of the airship No. 6. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/cb6/d99/026/cb6d99026ac7a1359a123959ef304d29.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  On October 19, 1901, due to bad weather, only five of the twenty-five members of the commission arrived on the next flight of Santos Dumont, among them was Deutsch de la Mert.  After the chronometer signal, the airship No. 6 took off, reached the Eiffel Tower, 9 minutes after the start of the flight, rounded it and headed back.  The audience applauded, many left the houses on the streets. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/224/e62/5fe/224e625fe6e48e66c606103b46472549.jpg" alt="image"></div><br><br>  Traffic has stopped.  Santos Dumont had only 20 minutes to make a return trip against the wind with the risk of damaging the engine.  Before the expiration of the deadline, there were only 5 minutes left.  Already above Bois, the airship lost altitude.  In the last minutes, the ball rocked close to the finish line.  It took 29 minutes 30 seconds after the start.  With the effort, he was able to level him at a height of 120 meters and lower him until the mechanics caught the control rope.  Chronometers showed 30 minutes 29 seconds. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/241/96d/5b4/24196d5b4d9127c419774895c8de3ef9.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The commission was not unanimous in its opinion.  One member of the commission said that Santos-Dumont did not win the prize, as he landed a few seconds after the deadline. <br><br>  On November 4, the commission met at the Aero Club.  Santos Dumont was declared the winner by 14 votes to nine. <br><br><h3>  1904 </h3><br>  <b>Grand prix d'aviation</b> <br>  In 1904, the same <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henri_Deutsch_de_la_Meurthe">Henri Deutsch de la Mert</a> and Ernest Archdikon created a prize fund of 50,000 francs ( <b>Grand Prix d'Aviation</b> ), which was to be given to the first pilot, who traveled a distance of one kilometer along a circular route on a heavier-air apparatus. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/1ce/a8f/ce0/1cea8fce0dd3a16ad4074a8419d437ac.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Farman_III">Henri Farman (Henri Farman)</a> , in the past, bicycle and racing driver, abandoned his old hobbies for the sake of aviation.</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/138/472/e2b/138472e2b8e14232ee2c8b096da5cac7.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  In 1907, Farman purchased the aircraft and set a number of European records on it.  He first took to the air on September 30, 1907, and on January 13, 1908, Farman flew 1 km in 1 minute 28 seconds along a closed route and received the Deutsch-Archdikon Award. <br><br><h3>  1919 </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/8ed/132/48f/8ed13248f484d76d84dabd7e84976bf0.jpg" alt="image" align="right">  <i>Raymond Desire Orteig (1870 - June 6, 1939) - American businessman of French origin, owner of 2 hotels ‚ÄúHotel Lafayette‚Äù and ‚ÄúBrevoort Hotel‚Äù in Greenwich Village in Lower Manhattan.</i> <br><br>  Being a wealthy New York businessman, on May 19, 1919, Orteig at a solemn meeting in honor of <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A0%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B1%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580_%25D0%25AD%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B8">Eddie Rickenbecker</a> , the most effective American ace of World War I, offered $ 25,000 in prize money to the first pilot, who within 5 years would make a non-stop flight from New York York to Paris.  Despite the fact that at that time it was a rather generous offer, it is believed that he practically did not risk anything, considering that at that time there was not a single aircraft in the world with which one could carry out a transatlantic flight.  ( <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259E%25D1%2580%25D1%2582%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B9%25D0%25B3,_%25D0%25A0%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B9%25D0%25BC%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B4">Wikipedia</a> ) <br><br>  The announcement of this prize Orteyg inspired post-war Franco-American cooperation.  The result was nine independent attempts to fly across the Atlantic.  Trying to win it, several pilots were killed or injured.  In 1924, Orteig extended the prize fund of his name. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/5a2/eae/d0f/5a2eaed0f8c62b4ca951773acc23801d.jpg" alt="image" align="right">  The transatlantic flight managed to accomplish the <b>25-year-old</b> Charles Lindberg <b>alone</b> , who on May 20, 1927, started at Garden City, Long Island, New York and landed at Le Bourget near Paris on May 21, thus becoming the owner of the Raymond prize Orteiga and the national hero of the United States. <br><br>  Prior to Lindberg, two English pilots ‚Äî John Alcock and Arthur Brown ‚Äî on the Newfoundland-Clifden (Ireland) route in 1919 made a transatlantic flight from west to east for the first time.  ( <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259B%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B1%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580%25D0%25B3,_%25D0%25A7%25D0%25B0%25D1%2580%25D0%25BB%25D1%258C%25D0%25B7">Wikipedia</a> ) <br><br>  Lindberg decided to take part in the competition, but the preparation of the flight required money.  He convinced nine entrepreneurs in St. Louis to help with financing.  At his request, Ryan Airlines from San Diego launched a special single-engine monoplane aircraft.  Lindberg himself participated in the development of the project.  He called the car "The <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spirit_of_St._Louis">Spirit of St. Louis</a> ."  ( <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259B%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B1%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580%25D0%25B3,_%25D0%25A7%25D0%25B0%25D1%2580%25D0%25BB%25D1%258C%25D0%25B7">Wikipedia</a> ) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/zm/zg/wv/zmzgwvbxzr8cjpuwlcy-hlwv1e0.jpeg" alt="image"><br><br>  On May 10‚Äì11, 1927, Lindberg tested an airplane flying from San Diego to New York, with an overnight stay in St. Louis.  The flight took 20 hours 21 minutes.  The length of the route was 5800 km. <br><br>  May 20 at 7:52 am Lindberg starts from Roosevelt Field (Garden City, Long Island, New York) and May 21 at 5:21 pm (Paris time - at 10:21 pm) lands at Le Bourget. <br><br>  For the transatlantic flight, Charles Lindberg was awarded the Flight Merit Cross and became the first person to receive this award, and he was also awarded the FAI Golden Aviation Medal.

On behalf of the Daniel Guggenheim Foundation for the Development of Aeronautics, Lindberg flies through the USA.  Then Lindberg learned about the research of rocket pioneer Robert Goddard, a professor of physics at Clark University, and persuaded the Guggenheim family to support Goddard's experiments.  These experiments later led to the creation of rockets, satellites and the beginning of space travel.  Lindberg also worked for several airlines as a technical consultant.

The concept of the competitions was created on the model of XPrize, Darpa Grand Challenge, and other international ‚Äúchallenge‚Äù engineering competitions. The prize fund of Up Great competitions in Russia will amount to <b>375 million rubles.</b>  The event supports and finances the state.  They are conducted as part of the National Technology Initiative.  Competition operator - Russian Venture Company. <br><br>  Technological contests impose minimum requirements on the formal composition of participants.  In fact, anyone can try their hand at solving a competitive task.  The main informal ‚Äúentry threshold‚Äù is a set of knowledge, competencies and know-how in a certain technological area, without which it is impossible to approach the solution of a competitive task. <br><br><blockquote>  <b>The technological barrier is</b> : <br><ul><li>  Significant unsolved technological problem that prevents the emergence of a new product in the new market </li><li>  No one in the world has achieved, but the desired level of capabilities (characteristics) of the technology, upon reaching which there is a sharp increase in demand for this technology </li></ul></blockquote><br>  Russian and foreign engineering teams, universities, research organizations and engineering bureaus can compete in Up Great contests.  If the development team wins, the cash prize is divided equally between them. <br><br>  <b>Funding</b> .  Developments are carried out at their own expense.  The rights to the results of intellectual activity belong to the participants. <br><br>  In July, three Up Great technology contests started: <br><br><ul><li>  <b><a href="http://city.upgreat.one/">‚ÄúWinter City‚Äù</a></b> Development of an unmanned vehicle capable of driving autonomously in winter and at different times of the day, in compliance with the Rules of the Road Traffic of the Russian Federation (hereinafter referred to as traffic rules) in the urban infrastructure, with the possible absence of a road marking, low road visibility canvases, in the presence of road traffic and traffic interference, at the level of the average driver. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Read more</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  Participants in the Winter City contest should develop an unmanned vehicle.  "Stuffing" should allow the machine to move confidently and safely in any climate and road conditions.  Both in the afternoon, and at night, in the conditions of a city traffic jam and along the highway, at destruction of a roadbed, etc. <br><br>  Now the overwhelming majority of tests of unmanned technology in the world are carried out in controlled conditions and predictable weather conditions ‚Äî a dry track, good visibility.  This is due to both the available level of technology development and objective factors - most startups in the industry appear in the US, where the climate is predominantly dry and hot. <br><br>  However, in order to achieve high levels of autonomy, it is necessary to test cars even in extreme conditions, including with limited visibility and uneven road surface.  One of the first to solve this problem was the American company Ford, which in the winter of 2016 tested the technology of driving in snow conditions at the landfill in Michigan.  In 2017, an American startup DriveAI tested an unmanned vehicle in the rain, at night, on ordinary roads.  Testing unmanned cars in the rain is also involved in the company Waymo.  The current level of technology allows the drone to move in light rain, but an emergency stop occurs when it rains for safety. <br><br>  The final tests of the Up Great contest will be held in the winter of 2019 at a specially equipped training ground.  The participating vehicles will have to travel 50 km in less than 3 hours, independently plotting a route taking into account the presence of other vehicles at the test site, observing traffic rules and not provoking other participants to violations.  On the track, additional difficulties will be created, such as frost, snow, lack of road, traffic congestion.  To win, you must go the route faster than others, while demonstrating the high quality of driving.  The winning team will receive 175 million rubles. <br></div></div></li><li>  <b><a href="http://1element.upgreat.one/">‚ÄúThe first element.</a></b>  <b><a href="http://1element.upgreat.one/">Earth ‚Äù</a></b> creation of power plants on hydrogen fuel cells, comparable in efficiency to traditional energy sources in vehicles, for medium vehicles, i.e.  for cars and motorcycles, small craft, small aircraft and heavy unmanned aerial vehicles. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Read more</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  Participants in the other two Up Great contests are to create hydrogen fuel cells for air and ground vehicles. <br><br>  Hydrogen has the highest internal energy per unit of weight compared to other fuels, while it is environmentally friendly - the by-product of the reaction in the fuel cell is pure water.  The Toyota Mirai passenger car produces about 6 liters of water per hydrogen mileage per 100 kilometers.  And no greenhouse gases.  Compared with lithium-ion batteries, hydrogen fuel cells do not require charging and have a longer service life. <br><br>  Research in the field of hydrogen energy today is carried out by the world's leading auto giants - Toyota, Honda, Hyundai.  In April 2017, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe announced the intentions of his government to gradually abandon hydrocarbon fuels and switch to a hydrogen economy.
