One of the directions in the evolution of such solutions is micro and mini data centers.  These compact solutions are especially attractive for small and medium businesses, where there is often no room even for a normal server.  Therefore, some manufacturers, including Russian (for example, the company Depo Computers, RAC, GreenMDC, etc.), began to produce cabinets with all the necessary additional equipment, which they are promoting in the market as a mini or micro data center. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/3c7/ad5/eff/3c7ad5eff19762b5c622dcbf58c98314.jpg"></div><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  What is a mini data center? </h2><br>  Micro (mini) data center is a complex consisting of one (micro data center) or several interconnected (mini data center) racks, provided with all the infrastructure necessary for the operation of IT equipment and previously assembled and tested by the manufacturer. <br>  These data centers are mainly designed to accommodate computing power and telecommunications equipment in unprepared premises, such as offices, warehouses, utility rooms or production facilities.  According to vendors, the installation time for their use is reduced to 60-70% compared with the classic solution. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/52f/089/33f/52f08933f98e0234d9cc9a098ea0aa76.png"></div><br>  <i><font color="#999999">Over the past decade, ‚ÄúMicro-Datacenters in Container‚Äù has been developed by leading foreign manufacturers (mainly server equipment suppliers) and a number of domestic system integrators.</font></i>

      The advantages of micro-data center, many of which can be placed in a small cabinet, manufacturers also include configuration flexibility, usually understanding by this the possibility of creating a customized solution for customer requirements, the minimum production and delivery time.  This is a complex product, a solution from one source: all the elements necessary for installation are included in the delivery package, which eliminates the difficulties during installation, commissioning and integration.  Equipment from one manufacturer (or partners) provides a high degree of system integration.  In addition, such a kit is pre-tested systems before sending to the customer. <br><br><h2>  Growth drivers </h2><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/84b/08b/33e/84b08b33e621698e2eaa8fb50ecacd46.png"></div><br>  <i><font color="#999999">Development trends of the world mini-data center market (according to the Marketsand Markets agency).</font></i>  <i><font color="#999999">The projected market growth is up to $ 6.3 billion in 2020.</font></i>  <i><font color="#999999">The growth rate is up to 29.8% per year.</font></i>  <i><font color="#999999">Largest markets: North America, China, India, Brazil.</font></i> <br><br>  Abroad this direction is considered quite promising.  Allegedly, such complexes are in great demand in the West.  So, given the progress in the field of the Internet of Things (IoT), micro data centers are becoming an interesting tool for processing data generated by IoT solutions.  Placing a micro data center near a data source reduces transmission delays and network bandwidth requirements, which is important with the rapid increase in the number of devices connected to the network. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d9a/2c9/fa0/d9a2c9fa0b73d91a5bb7b128648b02f0.png"></div><br>  <i><font color="#999999">Border computing platforms, which can play the role of micro data centers, allow you to distribute the load and bring the computing power closer to the data source, and reduce network latency.</font></i> <br><br>  Micro data centers are designed to minimize capital costs, optimize the use of data center areas and energy consumption, and increase deployment speed.  Several trends have led to this architecture: <br><br><ul><li>  <b>Increase hardware density:</b> virtualized IT equipment in cloud architectures, which previously required 10 racks, can now fit into one. </li><li>  <b>Convergence and integration:</b> servers, data warehouses, network equipment and software are integrated and validated by the vendor, delivered as a turnkey solution out of the box. </li><li>  <b>Network</b> latency <b>: the</b> need to reduce latency between data centers (for example, the cloud) and applications. </li><li>  <b>Deployment speed:</b> reducing the deployment time of a solution sometimes provides an opportunity to gain a competitive advantage. </li><li>  <b>Cost reduction:</b> in many cases, micro data centers may use excess capacity that is not used for one reason or another.  This underutilization is a common problem in corporate data centers. </li><li>  <b>Cloud Services Optimization:</b> Micro data centers play a key role in optimizing the performance and usefulness of mobile and other network devices when accessing the cloud. </li></ul><br><h2>  How does it work? </h2><br>  Often, micro data centers are equipped with built-in uninterruptible power supplies (UPS) and infrastructure management software (DCIM).  These solutions can be deployed in conventional offices as well as in more aggressive environments. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/8f8/fbe/06e/8f8fbe06e05545c766ed88a02ba3d50c.png"></div><br>  <i><font color="#999999">Micro and mini data centers are classified as small systems.</font></i> <br><br>  Typically, each of them includes the cabinet itself, as well as cooling systems, monitoring, fire suppression, power management and protection.  This is a kind of autonomous data center with a high level of security and sufficient cooling capacity.  And due to the light construction of such a mini-data center can be installed in places with low bearing capacity of floors. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/473/a56/e83/473a56e8348a2c464e5c3e35f783c889.png"></div><br>  <i><font color="#999999">The main elements of micro (mini) data center (according to Huawei): fire suppression, cooling, monitoring, UPS, power distribution, I / O, security.</font></i> <br><br>  Micro data centers can also contain: power distribution system with ‚Äúintelligent‚Äù PDUs (in addition to measuring energy consumption, they can support temperature and humidity control sensors in the rack), automatic gas fire extinguishing system, access control system (ACS) and other systems (in depending on the supplier). <br><br>  Execution may be different.  For example, modular micro data centers from Rittal are real safes.  They protect from fire, liquids, dust, burglary and corrosive gases.  The safe is supplied with an air-conditioning system installed at the factory, an optional system based on inverter technology, which saves up to 40% of energy by adjusting the power according to need.  If necessary, the safe can be additionally equipped with alarm systems, fire extinguishing, uninterrupted power supply, monitoring, etc. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/65a/c42/258/65ac42258593d4626ce8c04f65736887.png"></div><br>  <i><font color="#999999">Modular micro data center from Rittal.</font></i>  <i><font color="#999999">Its advantages include the following developers:</font></i> <i><font color="#999999"><br><br></font></i>  <i><font color="#999999">1. Save costs and time (there is no need to equip the available space in the building to the level of the server room);</font></i> <i><font color="#999999"><br></font></i>  <i><font color="#999999">2. Flexibility (modular layout, suitable even for hard-to-reach objects).</font></i> <i><font color="#999999"><br></font></i>  <i><font color="#999999">3. Long-term investments (re-assembly and transportation options);</font></i> <i><font color="#999999"><br></font></i>  <i><font color="#999999">4. Physical protection (the solution provides protection from fire, water, dust, smoke and external access);</font></i> <i><font color="#999999"><br></font></i>  <i><font color="#999999">5.

Fire alarm and active fire fighting in the server rack;</font></i> <i><font color="#999999"><br></font></i>  <i><font color="#999999">7. Reliable monitoring.</font></i> <br><br>  A small data center can be assembled from a series of cabinets, on the basis of which it is easy to organize a server, micro-data center for a small company, and a mini-data center for an average organization. <br>  Since it is possible to deploy critical IT services on the basis of micro data centers, a high level of fault tolerance can be ensured, in particular, all major engineering systems (power supply, cooling) can be backed up using the N + 1 scheme (and higher).  The office complex, where micro-data centers are being deployed, may not be equipped with a backup diesel generator set, so the micro-data center must provide autonomous power in case of an accident for 10-30 minutes. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/487/76c/0c8/48776c0c837563fd007bd53094d795c0.png"></div><br>  <i><font color="#999999">A micro data center is an autonomous, secure computing system built and tested in the factory.</font></i>  <i><font color="#999999">These data centers come with all the necessary equipment for power, cooling, security and control (DCIM).</font></i> <br><br>  Micro data center developers apply different cooling technologies.  Usually they proceed from the condition of minimizing the area occupied by the cooling system, as well as reducing the total cost of ownership and increasing energy efficiency. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a66/22d/4fd/a6622d4fd3bbce998384a5d36ffb743f.png"></div><br>  <i><font color="#999999">Major global manufacturers of mini and micro data centers (according to the MarketsandMarkets agency).</font></i> <br><br>  To make the solution structurally look like a single complex, the engineering equipment of the micro data center is usually placed in the same racks as the IT systems.  It is also possible to install elements of engineering infrastructure, such as UPS, in the same racks with IT equipment.  At the same time, designers seek to minimize the space occupied by engineering systems, including UPS, battery, and cooling systems. <br><br><h2>  Advantages and disadvantages of micro and mini data center </h2><br>  The advantages of these solutions include scalability, compactness and energy efficiency, rapid deployment, simple management, security.  This is a standardized solution, an economical solution. <br><br>  An important advantage of the micro data center is the ability to deploy additional computing power in conventional offices and other sites without specialized support infrastructure.  This reduces the capital costs associated with the expansion of existing data centers. <br><br>  We list the main advantages of such solutions minuses (according to Huawei). <br><table><tbody><tr><th>  Virtues <br></th><th>  disadvantages <br></th></tr><tr><td>  Ability to install in unprepared premises <br></td><td>  The need for maintenance and upkeep <br></td></tr><tr><td>  The possibility of placing equipment in regions where the necessary data center capacity <br></td><td>  The need for IT staff <br></td></tr><tr><td>  Relatively low cost <br></td><td>  Initial costs are higher than placing in a rented commercial data center <br></td></tr><tr><td>  High deployment speed <br></td><td>  Production and installation time is longer than switching to leased data center capacity <br></td></tr><tr><td>  The ability to move to another site <br></td><td>  Limited expansion options <br></td></tr><tr><td>  Minimum footprint <br></td><td>  Less flexibility than traditional solutions <br></td></tr></tbody></table><br>  The micro data center can be delivered to the operating site with racks, UPS, power distribution, cooling and control systems pre-installed and ready for deployment. <br><br><h2>  Examples of solutions </h2><br>  Over the past decade, a number of interesting developments in the field of mini- and micro data centers have been presented on the Russian market. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/747/66c/acd/74766cacdbcc6b957a10688d0c0bff1a.png"></div><br>  <i><font color="#999999">Micro-Datacenter Russian production - the development of ETegro Technologies, "Svyaz Engineering" and "Utileks."</font></i> <br><br>  For example, the ETegro micro data center is built on the basis of the DataStone + modular solution and combines cabinets with 19-inch racks and built-in Clever Breeze air conditioning systems manufactured by Utilex.  A typical micro data center solution consists of two soundproof insulated 42U cabinets with in-line precision air conditioners located between them. <br><br>  This is an enclosed, hermetic soundproofed complex with an IP65 protection class. <br><br>  IT infrastructure - ETegro Hyperion servers, ETegro Fastor storage systems and ETegro Eos switches.  The system uses double conversion UPS for Svyaz Engineering, the battery life is 15 minutes.  The redundancy level of the system is N + 1.  This solution was announced in 2015 as an efficient and cost-effective way to create a private cloud or ready-made IT infrastructure for small enterprises, branches and representative offices of geographically distributed companies.  As the creators promised, the creation of a fully operational infrastructure at any point of Russia will require no more than 12 weeks. <br><br>  In subsequent years, based on the experience of developing this type of micro data center, <a href="http://docs.wixstatic.com/ugd/7b1f67_e1478c2889eb49229e229a2cc501ba96.pdf">Utilex</a> created a whole line of mini and micro data centers.  These are mainly modular systems with the possibility of further expansion.  Among them is DataStone Mini ‚Äúsupermicro-data center‚Äù, designed to accommodate any 19-inch IT equipment up to 27U and with a power up to 2.5 kW.  It has a protection class of IP54, noise insulation (18 dBA), and the cooling system is based on built-in fans with anti-dust filters.  There is also the possibility of installing a remote monitoring system via TCP / IP, SNMP, RS485 (Modbus RTU). <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/175/6a7/289/1756a72895e47df5bd611cb3d88c7d58.png"></div><br>  <i><font color="#999999">Applications DataStone Mini - replacement of server rooms, private cloud infrastructure.</font></i> <br><br>  The advantages of this solution, developers include savings in capital costs, short deadlines for creating a data center, high fault tolerance, the ability to move it and remote control. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d82/fbd/501/d82fbd501f5c02eb06c037228567c7ef.png"></div><br>  <i><font color="#999999">Modular Micro Data Center Utilex DataStone + is designed to accommodate and ensure the required availability of computing, network equipment, storage systems, as well as any active and passive equipment.</font></i>  <i><font color="#999999">The solution with IP65 protection class has a closed cooling system (it is possible to build a cooling system with full redundancy of 2N) and supports up to 30 kW of IT load on one cabinet.</font></i> <br><br>  RSC Tornado Mini-Datacenter also includes all the necessary structural components: 1-2 computing racks (with Intel processors, Infiniband interconnect), cooling and power supply systems, communication subsystem, control server and display system (in the adjacent cabinet there is a pumping station, station water treatment, network equipment and storage).  Such systems are deployed in Rosgidromet, MIPT.  Preparation of the room for them is not required. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/6a7/023/2b1/6a70232b1540a4d88fa48b58116e5f98.png"></div><br>  In the RSC Tornado architecture, liquid cooling is used for standard Intel server boards, originally designed for air-blown systems.  Thanks to liquid cooling, a high energy efficiency ratio (PUE) is achieved - no more than 20% of the energy consumed is spent on cooling.  Liquid cooling makes the system quieter and much more compact: the mini-data center is placed in two enclosures, occupying an area of ‚Äã‚Äãabout 2 square meters.  m. Air cooling is left only for those components where the liquid is not economically feasible.  A similar system with a slightly smaller number of RSC nodes was launched at RosHydroMet. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/aaa/2c7/8f5/aaa2c78f518a5c07e9f58acd4fcba7c7.png"></div><br>  <i><font color="#999999">RSC company produces several lines of equipment based on its RSC Tornado complex - for micro data centers (16-64 servers), mini data centers (64-256 servers) and for large data centers on hundreds of servers.</font></i> <br><br>  Chinese Huawei has developed a whole line of micro and mini data centers. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b6d/f68/aa2/b6df68aa22cf050223359dab618bbdbb.png"></div><br>  <i><font color="#999999">The convergent mini-data center Huawei FusionModule 500 includes 1‚Äì2 cabinets for equipment up to 4 kW per rack, UPS with redundancy designed for autonomous operation for 15‚Äì240 minutes, integrated monitoring and power distribution systems, and a remote system battery control.</font></i> <br><br>  For example, Huawei FusionModule 500 can be used to house equipment of small offices, organize communication nodes of remote offices, branches and representative offices, create switching centers, dispatch centers and monitoring centers, situational centers and communication centers.

As part of this project, the CUBiC mini data center was installed by the specialists of the Russian company GreenMDC, designed to install one rack with power consumption up to 5 kW.  CUBiC worked in the Center for the execution of orders as the main data center for three months.  In the initial stages of this power was enough.  Later, after the commissioning of the modular data center TelecomOutdoor NGm, auxiliary equipment is located at CUBiC, and it continues to fulfill its role as a mini-data center. <br><br><h2>  Who needs it? </h2><br>  The use of mini-data centers can be justified not only in small companies, where there are often no professional specialists, but also in government structures and large business, where information is one of the most valuable assets.  Many customers are interested in creating micro-data center projects.  The cost of design, supply and commissioning of such a data center is comparable to the organization of the data center in the existing premises.  Micro data centers can be placed in a warehouse or directly in the shop, reduce dependence on data networks from factories or from external Internet channels. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/25a/418/4d0/25a4184d0e65e13683015499ee916d97.png"></div><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e2d/1d5/228/e2d1d522853390da903f81e6ee3a1ce8.png"></div><br>  <i><font color="#999999">Applications of micro and mini data centers (according to Schneider Electric).</font></i> <br><br>  This rapidly deployable integrated solution was not destined to make a revolution in the construction of the data center: their application remained niche.  Realizations of micro and mini data centers in our country are rare.  However, digital information, the Internet of things and boundary computing, interest in modular convergent / hyperconvergent platforms and clouds - all this can give this direction new incentives for development. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/352746/">https://habr.com/ru/post/352746/</a></p>
