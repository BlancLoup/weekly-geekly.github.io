We haven‚Äôt been promoted yet, so after opening you‚Äôll find out about it first. <br>  The fact that politics has become one of the most popular topics on the network is understandable even to the backward.  It is also clear that the more we tighten the screws, the more discussions flow to the Internet.  All who feel like it, speak out, promise anything, and call themselves and others anyhow.  We thought for a long time how to structure it all, and decided to try to count all users on the traditional scale: who is left, who is right, and who is centrist. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>

    <h5>  Little clever thoughts </h5><br><br>  In political science it was customary to place political convictions on a flat scale from left to right.  Now everyone understood that a simple division into ‚Äúleft‚Äù and ‚Äúright‚Äù incorrectly reflects the actually existing diverse political spectrum. <br><br>  Many of our politicians make statements on the economy relating to the characteristic "left direction", while they call themselves "right".  With the programs of parties in general, the darkness, thank God, that almost nobody reads them except the authors.  Many suggest using the Nolan scale.  This is a ‚Äúpolitical compass‚Äù (showing, along with the axis ‚Äúleft‚Äù - ‚Äúright‚Äù, attitude to economic issues, distribution to libertarian and authoritarian sociopolitical convictions), proposed by American libertarian David Nolan in 1970. If you, Habrouzer, do not banned on wikipedia ( <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25CF%25EE%25EB%25E8%25F2%25E8%25F7%25E5%25F1%25EA%25E8%25E5_%25F3%25E1%25E5%25E6%25E4%25E5%25ED%25E8%25FF">http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%CF%EE%EB%E8%F2%E8%F7%E5%F1%EA%E8%E5_%F3%E1%E5%E6%E4 % E5% ED% E8% FF</a> ), then there you will find everything in detail. <br><br><br>  All this did not suit us, and we decided to count in each individual case.  And they came up with the following - a service of political profiles in the <a href="http://politix.ru/">politix.ru</a> network.  The site has already been created and launched.  The launch, as expected, timed to the promised end of the world on December 21, 2012, and, in fact, the beginning of a new era in politics. <br><br><h5>  How it works? </h5><br><br>  <a href="http://politix.ru/">Politix.ru</a> creates a dynamic picture of your political beliefs in the form of a beautiful chart on the left-right-center scale.  The scale is created on the basis of polls posted on the site.  Voting can be added to any material or person.  The answers to the questions are structured in such a way that one of the options (3 in all) so far reflects the political views of one of the three segments of the political spectrum.  It turns out beautiful.  By the way, then you can fumble profile in social networks and measure personal belongings with friends.  On your page in the Politprofile section contains all the information about the activity on the site: what I read, how many comments I left, in which polls I took part.  By the way, the more often you take part in polls, the more accurate the political profile diagram. <br><br>  As soon as you <a href="http://politix.ru/">enter politix.ru</a> and register or log in via FB, VK or Twi, and then take part in polls, read and comment, you start to create such a profile: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/801/7b3/3c7/8017b33c7d776755162c298b6d4a2d6b.png"><br><br>  It also tastes good with the help of the almighty, fashionable, adaptive layout, and everything looks on smartphones and tablets, so vote anywhere from any device: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/446/860/bc2/446860bc215ad4e9fa56f0e846b3dab7.png"><br><br><h5>  At the forefront of progress </h5><br><br>  Politix.ru developed a long time.  The main task was, of course, a diagram of political views.  We coped with this task.  The site is built on the principle of "objects", each of which (article, quotation, profile, survey, etc.) can be tied to another created object. <br><br>  They tried to make the design minimalistic and mega usable so that the eye was happy and the saliva was separated. <br><br><h5>  The main: <br></h5><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/b26/5f1/f5d/b265f1f5d5f744ac763eb56724c4610d.png"><br><h5>  What else? </h5><br><br>  You need to vote on the basis of something: a quote, character, material or article, so that there is something to discuss.  Therefore, on politix.ru we also post many topical articles and expert opinions.  This is taken to create surveys materials from leading news and analytical portals or articles written by us.  The team of our enthusiasts is growing.  In any case, if the article is copied or retold on our website, the original is also referred to in the photo as well. <br><h5>  Quotes </h5><br><br>  An important part of the site is the quotes of politicians who, as objects, can be ‚Äútied‚Äù to the article and fumble in social  networks.  Today‚Äôs Internet world is microblogging, so we don‚Äôt lag behind, but give all the most important things in one phrase. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/bb0/b40/73b/bb0b4073b946a1ca993ce134964de795.png"><br><br><h5>  Politicians </h5><br><br>  Well, the last thing I would like to tell you about is the base of professional politicians, the key figures of Russian and world politics.  The base is small, but assembled by hand and constantly updated.  In it, we try to maintain the most current posts and statuses of people.  And the most interesting thing is that politicians who have found their profiles with us will soon be able to confirm their ownership and communicate with people on the site, leave comments and publish quotes from themselves.  We hope it will be perky! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/930/218/130/93021813047d0cbcbbd409cf72399013.png"><br><br>  We started very recently.  Needless to say, what they did with the soul, a lot of time and money was invested.  We hope that the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãpolitical profiles will be a success. <br><br>  In general, well, Habrayuzer!  Find out who you are! <br><br>  PS <br><br>  Rays of good will not interfere with us at these addresses: <br><br>  <a href="">www.facebook.com/politix.ru</a> <br>  <a href="http://vk.com/politix_ru">vk.com/politix</a> <br>  <a href="http://twitter.com/politix_ru">twitter.com/politix</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/165979/">https://habr.com/ru/post/165979/</a></p>
