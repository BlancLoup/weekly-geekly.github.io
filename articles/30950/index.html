      Often I answer the question with a question: ‚ÄúIf you were the owner of the theater, what would be more important, hire a person who sells tickets or hire a troupe that will perform the show?‚Äù.  The question is ridiculous, since both of these posts are necessary.  Different types of people satisfy different needs, each of which must be involved so that the business can spin. <br><br>  Market segments and characters are different tools for different purposes.  If market segmentation helps us highlight our potential customers, characters help us meet the needs of these people.  When they are applied simultaneously, it gives the opportunity to crank the entire process, starting from a call to a specific need and to its satisfaction. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>  First of all, we must remember that market segmentation is intended to best direct and broadcast marketing messages that should cause some kind of need.  All potential customers are divided into groups, in accordance with their willingness to respond to various marketing channels and messages.  Such segmentation helps predict market favor and predict buying behavior. <br><br>  Since the goal is to attract the attention of the client, to justify and cause the necessary need, market segmentation has historically been based on different variables that are somehow related to the evolving need: geography, age, gender, income, education, employment and other traditional demographic characteristics, also as well as psychographic from a series of personal characteristics, lifestyle, values ‚Äã‚Äãand attitudes.  This is necessary because these attributes indicate the language in which to <i>speak</i> with different groups of people. <br><br>  On the other hand, the characters indicate exactly how people <i>will interact with you</i> .  Suppose you are creating a site dedicated to real estate and already have the data on the market segment that allow you to cause the desired need.  These segments determine exactly which marketing programs can be most successful, but they are completely useless in terms of how the site itself should work or how it should be designed.  If we know that the average age of a certain segment is 41 years old, then this does not tell us what piece of the piece should be bolted to the site.  If we know where our target audience lives, it will not tell us anything about how to navigate the site and what pictures should be on it.  In order to decide on content, structure, design and other features, we need a completely different type of segmentation, based on completely different characteristics. <br><br>  Characters are segments that are determined mainly by intention and behavior, since these indicators are most important for the decisions that are listed above.  Intention determines why people come to the site and what they are trying to do, and behavior demonstrates how they are going to make their intentions come true.  If for a site, for real estate, you have a segment whose intention is to find a home, then you already have reason to determine what kind of content and which functions should be present on the site to help this segment.  If you know the behavior and attributes of this segment (for example, if people of this segment mostly prefer personal contact and fear the very process of finding suitable housing), then you have the opportunity to make the right decision on how to structure and format the content and different chips on your site. <br><br>  And by the way, the characters are not the same as the role or title of the position.  If you simply create jobs called the ‚Äúexecutive character‚Äù (Executive persona) and the ‚Äúauxiliary character‚Äù (Administrative Assistant persona), this is unlikely to be beneficial, since not all managers have the same goals and not all act in the same way.  It would be more correct to segment by behavior and intention, since what people want to do and the way they try to do it often does not completely coincide with the name of their working position.  And finally, you should study three different types of leadership characters and not a single administrator character, since the intentions and behavior of the latter are already represented in one of the leadership characters. <br><br>  In essence, market segmentation answers the questions ‚ÄúWho?‚Äù And ‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù: Who is your target audience, what products or services does it need, what exactly would they like to buy and at what price, with what marketing programs can you successfully reach them and so on. <br><br>  Once you have determined what your product is, the characters will help you answer the question ‚ÄúWhy?‚Äù And ‚ÄúHow?‚Äù.  Why this product or service will not be indifferent to your target audience?  Why do people who are represented in this audience need it and why will they use it?  How exactly should it be structured and designed to make it convenient for people to use it exactly as they want?  How can we be sure that the site gives exactly the experience they need, and it brings exactly the business results we need? <br><br>  Both methods underlie the creation and application of a successful web strategy and both tools should be used on the principle of symbiosis.  Under the market segments are increasingly meant the goals and behavior of consumers, as soon as possible to make a full portrait of potential customers.  Characters, being a real tool for quality design, are very useful for market segmentation in conjunction with quantitative techniques, such as statistical analysis of the data. <br><br>  Market segments and characters together produce a complete understanding of our customers, including how to lure them to our doors, how to invite them inside and how to satisfy them so that they come again.  When these techniques are used together, the marketing process and the delivery itself becomes much shorter, since both of them are necessary to make a successful website. <br><br>  <b>Translation from English to:</b> <br>  <a href="http://blog.worldwebstudio.com/">blog.worldwebstudio.com</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/30950/">https://habr.com/ru/post/30950/</a></p>
