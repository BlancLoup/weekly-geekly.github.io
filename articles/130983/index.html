Yes, October 30 is already soon, and it may seem that it is too late to publish a similar topic, but, first, some of the administrators of mail systems might not have thought about the need for such actions before and they still have time to fix it. secondly, this is not the last abolition of DST in our world, and Russian-speaking people are everywhere, and thirdly, until yesterday evening, I did not have, unfortunately, all the necessary information to describe this process.  (Of course, users can remake appointments and events manually, but automated it is always better, faster and more accurate, isn‚Äôt it?) <br><br>  I do not have resource pb, so I omit the description of the process of their processing.  The original video of the Exchange team, including on.  and this issue can be viewed <a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/Blogs/joelsch/DST-How-to-Address-Daylight-Saving-Time-in-Exchange-Server-by-Using-the-Exchange-Calendar-Update-To">here</a> . <br><br>  I have not tested the applicability of this manual for Exchange 2007, only for Exchange 2003, but judging by the original Microsoft articles, there are no differences in the procedure.  Despite the fact that on the page <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/gp/cp_dst/ru">of the Help and Support Center for the transition to summer and winter time, there</a> is a promise to release a special update for the Exchange servers, it is still not there, and Microsoft support doubts that it will be released before October 30.

      I assume that the latest available service packs are installed on your Exchange servers. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  1. Update Outlook calendars (only needed if you have users who deliver mail to .pst files): <br>  1.1.  Update all client computers by <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/sysadm/130305/">updating</a> Windows time zones. <br>  1.2.  Install on all client computers with Outlook the appropriate version of the <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/931667">‚ÄúUpdate Time Zone Data Tools‚Äù for Microsoft Outlook</a> <br>  1.3.  Configure the automatic launch of ‚ÄúTools ...‚Äù when a user logs on to Windows with, for example, the ‚Äú/ quiet‚Äù command line parameter (I recommend that you check for the presence of an installed Windows update before installing / running the server).  This will update the calendar at the default mail delivery location, which can be located either in the locally located PST file or in the Exchange database.  It's okay when the server calendar is updated again with the Exchange Calendar Update Tool; each calendar item will be updated only once.  Multiple launch of "Tools ..." also does not produce any destructive actions. <br>  1.4 ‚ÄúThe Time Zone Data Update Tool‚Äù, when processing an event, will automatically send all its participants notifications about time changes.  Instruct users to accept these changes. <br><br>  2. Preparation for updating server calendars: <br>  2.1.  Please note that despite the fact that the main <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/941018/en-us">article</a> devoted to the problem of updating meetings and events in the calendars of Exchange users states that on the Exchange servers, before updating the server calendars, you need to install a time zone update for Windows, the Russian Premier support does not recommend doing so .  Instead, they offer to install the OS update on the Exchange servers at the very end.  The choice is yours.  If you have a contract for Prime support, I recommend not to read it, but to contact them. <br>  2.2.  Prepare a custom user to update calendars located on the Exchange server: <br>  2.2.1.  Create a user in your AD domain (EXAMPLE \ DSTUpdate). <br>  2.2.2.  Create a user mailbox on one of the Exchange-servers. <br>  2.2.3.  Give him Exchange View Only Administrator rights for the entire Exchange organization. <br>  2.3.  Prepare your computer to run the Exchange Calendar Update Tool (DSTPC). <br>  2.3.1.  The computer must be installed: <br>  2.3.1.1.  Any of OS: Windows Server 2003, Windows XP, Windows Vista <br>  2.3.1.2.  Microsoft Office Outlook 2003 Service Pack 2 or Microsoft Office Outlook 2007 (Better, of course, 2007 SP2) <br>  2.3.1.3.  "Time Zone Data Update Tool" for Microsoft Outlook <br>  2.3.1.4.  Microsoft .NET Framework version 2.0 <br>  2.3.2.  No Exchange management tools, such as the Exchange System Manager Console, etc. should be installed on the computer. <br>  2.3.3.  You can not prepare such a computer yourself, but use a pre-configured <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/933185">virtual machine</a> .  Of course, it will need to be included in your AD domain. <br>  2.3.4.  Add the user DSTUpdate to the local administrators group of this computer. <br>  2.3.5.  Install the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx%3FFamilyId%3D27BB0EE2-03AC-4E5B-AEC5-3E878490FCE1%26amp%3Bdisplaylang%3Den">Exchange Calendar Update Configuration Tool</a> on this computer. <br>  2.3.6.  Login to DSTPC as DSTUpdate and: <br>  2.3.6.1.  Set the value of the HKEY_CURRENT_USER \ Software \ Microsoft \ Exchange \ client \ options \ PickLogonProfile (REG_SZ) parameter to "0". <br>  2.3.6.2.  Locate and rename the% USERPROFILE% \ Local Settings \ Application Data \ Microsoft \ Outlook \ extend.dat file as you please. <br><br>  3. Unloading time zones from user accounts: <br>  3.1.  Log on to the DSTPC computer with the user DSTUpdate and run the Exchange Calendar Update Configuration Tool <br>  3.2.  Logging level leave Default.  If you see errors in the log, switch to Verbose to figure it out, but just like that - no need to trash the output. <br>  3.3.  On the Time Zone Extraction page, select the desired servers.  If you have a lot of servers, it may take several hours to go through everything. <br>  3.4.  After clicking Next, the Exchange Calendar Update Configuration Tool will try to unload users' time zones from the Exchange servers to the file output.txt, which, by the way, is RECORDED each time the application is launched and an attempt is made to upload data. <br>  3.5.  If the user, on whose behalf the application is running, does not have access to some pb, you will see the following entry in TimeZoneExtraction.log: [10/20/2011 10:26:02] [552]: HrProcessMailboxTable: Unable log grow user mailbox: Error 0x8004011D.).  To solve this problem, use p.4, then unload time zones again. <br>  3.6.  Close the application and go to step 5. <br><br>  4. Providing access to the user boxes for the DSTUpdate user: <br>  4.1.  On the computer with the Exchange management tools installed under the account belonging to the Domain Admins group and having Exchange Full Administrator rights to the Exchange organization, run the cscript script GrantMailboxPermission.vbs -Add EXAMPLE \ DSTUpdate ChangeRights.txt <br>  4.1.1.  The script is taken from the same article 941018, in the section REFERENCES. <br>  4.1.2.  The script takes the LegacyExchangeDN list from the ChangeRights.txt file and provides the EXAMPLE \ DSTUpdate user with Full Mailbox Access and Send As permissions for each mailbox specified in it. <br>  4.1.3.  The ChangeRights.txt file must be specially prepared (Microsoft Office Excel can help you): <br>  4.1.3.1.  As a blank, TimeZoneExtraction.log is taken.  It should be edited so that the resulting file contains lines containing only the LegacyExchangeDN (/ O = EXAMPLE / OU = FIRST ADMINISTRATIVE GROUP / CN = RECIPIENTS / CN = IVANOV.II) without a point at the end, one per line.  Empty lines, lines with any other content should not be.  That is, you need to cut everything in front of LegacyExchangeDN (starting with ‚Äú/‚Äù) and a period at the end. <br>  4.1.3.2.  All service mailboxes of the following type should be removed from the file: <br>  / O = EXAMPLE / OU = FIRST ADMINISTRATIVE GROUP / CN = CONFIGURATION / CN = CONNECTIONS / CN = SMTP (EXCHANGESERVER) / CN = {11111111-1111-1111-1111-11111111111111} <br>  / O = EXAMPLE / OU = FIRST ADMINISTRATIVE GROUP / CN = RECIPIENTS / CN = SYSTEMMAILBOX? 11111111-1111-1111-1111-11111111111111? <br>  / O = EXAMPLE / OU = FIRST ADMINISTRATIVE GROUP / CN = CONFIGURATION / CN = SERVERS / CN = EXCHANGESERVER / CN = MICROSOFT SYSTEM ATTENDANT <br>  4.2.  The output of the script is a set consisting of points and exclamation marks.  An exclamation mark means an error, a period - everything is OK. <br>  4.2.1.  Errors are written to the GrantMailboxPermission.err file. <br>  4.2.2.  View error <br>  ADMINISTRATIVE GROUP / CN = RECIPIENTS / CN = IVANOV.II in DC = example, DC = com. <br>  LDAP path from / O = EXAMPLE / OU = FIRST ADMINISTRATIVE GROUP / CN = RECIPIENTS / CN = IVANOV.II <br>  means that the user account in AD is not associated with the mailbox.  If everything is correct, and the user really should not be assigned to the box, feel free to ignore these errors. <br>  4.3.  You can run the script an unlimited number of times. <br>  4.4.  Permission results are recorded in the GrantMailboxPermission.log file.  Take care of it - for it then it will be necessary to cancel the granted permissions in Section 6. <br><br>  5. Processing server calendars: <br>  5.1.  It is performed using the same Exchange Calendar Update Configuration Tool.  Processing is performed on the output.txt, obtained in paragraph 3. <br>  5.1.1.  If item 3 has already been fully implemented: <br>  5.1.1.1.  On the mail server selection page, click the Skip button. <br>  5.1.1.2.  On the next screen, indicate the prepared output.txt <br>  5.2.  The output.txt should be properly prepared (an advanced text editor can help you): <br>  5.2.1.  All utility pb should be removed from the file. <br>  5.2.2.  On each line with the pb, the time zone must be indicated corresponding to the region: <br>  / O = EXAMPLE / OU = FIRST ADMINISTRATIVE GROUP / cn = Configuration / cn = Servers / cn = EXCHANGESERVER / O = EXAMPLE / OU = FIRST ADMINISTRATIVE GROUP / CN = RECIPIENTS / CN = IVANOV.II Russian Standard Time <br>  5.2.2.1.  If the time zone is not specified, you must specify it manually.  If the time zone is incorrect, exclude such users from automated processing. <br>  5.2.2.2.  The names of the time zones correspond to the names of the sections of the registry section HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE \ SOFTWARE \ Microsoft \ Windows NT \ CurrentVersion \ Time Zones \ <br>  5.3.  Further carry out all actions being guided by the simple master. <br>  5.4.  If you have a lot of client computers and not all of them have Windows update installed, you will have to update the calendars in the server pb several times, because  non-upgraded users, meanwhile, could create meetings and events. <br><br>  6. Cleaning after update. <br>  6.1.  Run the GrantMailboxPermission.vbs script with the "-remove" parameter.  Using the data from the GrantMailboxPermission.log file, the script will remove the permissions granted to the DSTUpdate user on the mailbox of users. <br>  6.2.  Cancel the Exchange View Only Administrator permission for the user DSTUpdate. <br>  6.3.  Remove the user DSTUpdate from the group of local administrators of the DSTPC computer and from AD. <br>  6.4.  If necessary, remove the DSTPC computer from AD and uninstall the OS on it. <br><br>  7. What you need to update manually: <br>  7.1 The calendars in the public folders of Outlook, although they are located on the server, are not updated as part of the above actions.  You must update them manually using the Time Zone Data Update Tool for Microsoft Outlook. <br>  7.2 Calendars in PST files that are not the default mail delivery location will also have to be updated manually.  You can instruct technical support or the users themselves how to use the ‚ÄúTime Zone Data Update Tool‚Äù. <br>  7.3 Server calendars of users with the wrong time zones.  With the help of the same "Tools ..." </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/130983/">https://habr.com/ru/post/130983/</a></p>
