The first of these, the creation of a public key, has already been completed in the first step. </li><li>  At first glance, the anti-logical action is performed - the secret key is destroyed without the possibility of recovery. </li></ol><br><a name="habracut"></a>  Using the remaining public key to encrypt data does not make sense (decryption in the absence of a secret key is considered impossible), but the public key can be used to verify electronic signatures created in the second step. <br>  This approach can be used for cryptographically reliable data binding.  In this case, the public key of the original key pair becomes the link identifier.

      A significant advantage is that the key pair used cannot be compromised otherwise than by brute force, or through the exploitation of the mathematical vulnerability of the algorithm used.  If the secret key no longer exists at all, it cannot be stolen, tricked out, or extorted. <br><br><h3>  Usage example </h3><br>  <b>Task:</b> <i>in a distributed system, participants are registered under the unique identifiers created by them.</i>  <i>It is required to make the task of ‚Äúhijacking‚Äù someone else's identifier (identity theft) as difficult as possible.</i>  <i>In the event of an identifier hijacking, ensure that the true owner can return the stolen.</i> <br><br>  Ways to solve the problem without using the technology in question: <br><br><ul><li>  <b>"Zero option."</b>  Rely on the honesty of the participants. </li><li>  <b>"Administrative prohibition."</b>  When registering participants require a passport.  Legally prohibit the use of other people's identifiers.  To bind the identifier to the phone number, use multi-factor authentication.  If you suspect, again require a passport.  Rely on the integrity and integrity of authorized reviewers.  If unlawful use is detected, fine and / or imprison the guilty. </li><li>  <b>"Public key as an identifier".</b>  Accordingly, the secret key is used as a means of authorization.  In principle, a worthy option (in particular, is used in cryptographic games), with the exception that when a secret key is lost or compromised, the participant irreversibly leaves the game. </li></ul><br>  Solving the problem using one-time secret keys: <br><br><ol><li>  The participant creates an identifying key pair [SK <sub>0</sub> , PK <sub>0</sub> ].  The public key PK <sub>0</sub> (or its hash) becomes the unique identifier of the participant. </li><li>  The participant creates an additional set of key pairs [SK <sub>1</sub> , PK <sub>1</sub> ], [SK <sub>2</sub> , PK <sub>2</sub> ] ... [SK <sub>n</sub> , PK <sub>n</sub> ], and the public key of each of them is signed with the key SK <sub>0</sub> . </li><li>  Key SK <sub>0 is</sub> destroyed.  Steps one through three are performed in a single process without writing SK0 into non-volatile memory. </li><li>  For authentication, the participant uses one of the key pairs created in the second step (for example, [SK <sub>1</sub> , PK <sub>1</sub> ]), and hides the rest, if they were created, in a safe place. </li><li>  If the key pair being used is compromised, its key (in the example, PK <sub>1</sub> ) is placed in the list of reviews, and one of the spare keys is used for authentication.  Or, another additional key is created that has a certification chain starting with PK <sub>0</sub> (for example, PK <sub>0</sub> - PK <sub>2</sub> - PK <sub>n + 1</sub> ). </li></ol><br>  Speaking specifically about cryptocurrencies, the solution of the problem described here does not make much sense (with the help of a stolen key, the attacker immediately empties the wallet), but the topic of "authentication" is far from being used in cryptocurrency. <br>  For convenience of further discussion, the following notation can be proposed for the keys used: <br>  <b>i-key</b> - identification key (identity key).  In this example, it is PK <sub>0</sub> . <br>  <b>a-key</b> - authentication key.  In this example, this is PK <sub>1</sub> or any other key, directly or indirectly signed by <i>i-key</i> . <br>  <b>hc-key</b> is one of the additional securely hidden keys (neither the fact of their existence nor their number is known to the attacker) is used to restore access in case of <i>a-key</i> compromise. <br><br>  <b>A small note</b> to the use of one-time secret keys.  The scheme is workable only if the subject who created the original key pair has no motivation to keep a secret key for himself for some separate need.  When using this technology for authentication, all needs are completely covered by a set of additional hc-keys (by the way, a riddle for those present: what does the abbreviation hc mean?).  Preserving the original key does not bring any benefits, but it creates a vulnerability that makes it possible to permanently hijack the identifier. <br><br><hr>  PS If the technology described here is suddenly original, then there is a desire to turn this publication into an article in some respected English-language publication.  For those who can help with this, I propose cooperation either for remuneration or for co-authorship. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/420095/">https://habr.com/ru/post/420095/</a></p>
