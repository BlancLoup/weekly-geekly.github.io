      The design of parasitic elements and the coordination of the antenna come from the properties of the vibrator.  The properties of a half-wave dipole are well known and widely described.  The radiation resistance is 73Œ© at the center frequency, the radiation pattern is almost circular, with a small gain of 2.15 dBi perpendicular to the axis. <br><br>  The dipole axis passes through the E-plane, i.e.  the polarization of the radiation coincides with the axis of the dipole. <br><br>  The radiation resistance decreases rapidly with decreasing frequency and increases with increasing frequency. <br>  A dipole centered at 600 MHz with a CWS = 1 per line 73Œ© will have a CWS = 2 already at frequencies 560 and 650 MHz, i.e.  retains an acceptable CWS in the range of -7% ... + 8%. <br><br>  The dipole is ideal for narrowband applications, and you can make it broadband only by compromise ways - add parasitic elements (reflectors, directors), selecting their geometry so as to equalize the characteristic impedance in different parts of the range.  With this geometry selection, the gain of a multi-element antenna will be significantly lower than with the same number of parasitic elements optimized for a narrow range.  Antenna gain is very uneven in range, and the CWS goes beyond the bounds of decency at the edges of the range. <br><br><h3>  Part I. Cone Vibrator (BowTie radiator) </h3><br>  There are also other designs of vibrators, the so-called VSS, frequency-independent.  Their radiation resistance is significantly less dependent on frequency; they can operate in a relatively wide frequency range with high efficiency and acceptable SWR. <br><br>  One of these designs is the biconical antenna: <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/083/125/ebf/083125ebffb52c93b4596768cb8ade98.jpg"></div><br><br>  Its properties are preserved if instead of volume cones to apply their projections - flat triangles in the form of a bow tie (eng. - BowTie). <br><br>  If the triangles are infinite - the antenna will work at all frequencies: <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/3e6/591/360/3e6591360d52d7bdef6487ac124db34e.gif"></div><br>  If you create triangles of finite size - they can work in some large frequency range. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/61a/dc6/10b/61adc610b87edc9cfc3089e95b380321.gif"></div><br>  Moreover, the triangle does not have to be solid. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/dd7/4bd/69b/dd74bd69b7745d05573c92b9d370cad2.gif"></div><br>  Its properties are preserved even when only two beams are left from the plane, although with jumpers, the triangle radiates a little better. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">3D view, BowTie solid, BowTie whiskers</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c94/727/f4a/c94727f4a6a7e9e1183a9f99ef990a28.png"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/114/c22/5d8/114c225d8ba6680f3545f7ab8a494e98.png"></div></div><br>  Next, we will consider only the version of the two whiskers (eng. - Whiskers) - the most simple and common. <br><br>  The center frequency for the BowTie is such a wavelength when each of the 4 whiskers has a length of ~ 0.47Œª (with a technological gap in the center of 1 "= 2.5 cm). <br><br>  This means that the BowTie vibrator is about 2 times larger than a half-wave dipole.  The full width of the dipole is ~ 0.5Œª, and the full width of the BowTie is ~ 1Œª. <br><br>  Such dimensions make it unacceptably large at frequencies below 200 MHz, so it does not apply on TV channels 1-5 and does not apply in the FM radio. <br><br>  For frequencies 200 ... 800 MHz, its dimensions are quite acceptable, which, in combination with broadband, ensured mass, and dominance in the antenna segment 10+ dBi. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Complex wave impedance, Z Œ©</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/1f0/fff/059/1f0fff0595341d2d44e00f0378f56efa.png"></div></div><br>  The radiation impedance at the center frequency (all examples will be for 600 MHz) is about 545Œ© (for a conductor diameter of 2.8 mm) and smoothly drops to 200Œ© at frequencies of 350 and 800 MHz. <br><br>  Matching the 545Œ© to the 75Œ© coaxial line is very non-standard (albeit implemented if necessary), but for working in a wide frequency band it is unnecessary and even undesirable.  Acceptable for television CWS will be if you use power from 300 to 600Œ©.  The minimum averaged in the range of 470 ... 790 MHz CWS is obtained by supplying ~ 400Œ©. <br><br>  Here is the SWR (eng. - SWR) in the frequency band 400..800 MHz with 400Œ© power supply, and a comparison with the SWR of the half-wave dipole to the 73Œ© line. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">SWR / KSV BowTie</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/4ab/9c0/804/4ab9c0804409b42fc8dcb114424b30b8.png"></div></div><br>  The graph shows options with a mustache opening angle from 20 to 60 degrees.  The angle does not greatly affect, the optimum angle is about 33 degrees.  If the classical dipole allows you to keep SWR &lt;2 in the 560 ... 650 MHz band, then the BowTie vibrator has a CWS &lt;2 in the 470 ... 690 MHz band, i.e.  covers the entire TV band of UHF (in the future, channels 49 and above will be sold for the needs of LTE-700 after SECAM ceases broadcasting), and in the frequency band up to 790 MHz it has a CWS &lt;3, which is also acceptable. <br><br>  The radiation pattern of the BowTie differs slightly from the dipole.  Up / down BowTie emits 3-4 dB weaker than forward / backward.  The side suppresses radiation much stronger than the classical dipole.  Due to this, the forward / backward gain at the center frequency of about 4.8 dBi (versus 2.15 dBi dipole), and in the 400 ... 800 MHz frequency band smoothly increases from 3.6 dBi to 6.7 dBi. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Gain, Pattern</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/25f/843/a8a/25f843a8af56f76ebe5ece1951ffe381.png"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/bab/786/9a4/bab7869a43da3246349c96e067938127.png"></div></div><br>  For matching a 75Œ© cable with a single BowTie, a 6: 1 balun (Bal-Un, Balanced-Unbalanced transformer) will be optimal, which can be made from a 4: 1 balun or by running on a 2-hole ring: <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Balun 6: 1</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c64/c77/2de/c64c772de5593015bd64bacd834ba2ec.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/971/a7c/f69/971a7cf69c046a2292496d8fa8157a86.jpg"></div></div><br>  A standard 300Œ© 4: 1 balun will also work, but the CWS will be&gt; 2. <br><br><h3>  Part Ia Cone Vibrator - All Wave? </h3><br>  Cone antenna refers in part to the PNA (frequency-independent antenna) and to UWB (Ultra-Wide Band) antenna type. <br><br>  The maximum radiation resistance of the cone vibrator has a whisker length of 0.47Œª (about 545Œ©), with a deviation of length in any direction - the resistance drops to a minimum of 84Œ© (at 0.31Œª). <br><br>  Further shortening of the wave leads again to an increase in resistance to 545Œ© with the length of the whiskers of a multiple of 0.47Œª (600, 1200, 1800, 2400 MHz), and to a cyclic fall to 84Œ© with the length of the whiskers of a multiple of 0.47Œª, but with a fixed shift of 0.24Œª (900, 1500, 2100, 2700 MHz). <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">0.47Œª@600 Mhz, Impedance in 300 .. 4000 Mhz band</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/851/818/6d2/8518186d25be41a6e3f8d9cf822ff520.png"></div></div><br>  Thus, if we have the possibility of matching the impedance in the range of 84-545Œ©, the antenna can be used in a very wide frequency range, unlike a dipole whose resistance will increase indefinitely or fall at low frequencies to zero. <br><br>  The practical benefit of this property of cone antennas can only be extracted with an active matching device installed directly next to the antenna, which will convert 84-545Œ© to 50 or 75Œ© resistance of the radio receiver and / or transmitter transmission lines. <br><br>  With passive matching via a fixed transformer, it is practically impossible to benefit from such broadband properties.  An acceptable VSWR is maintained in a relatively narrow frequency range, although it is wider than that of a conventional dipole.  If by SWR = 2 the matching range is + -8% for a dipole, then for a tapered vibrator it is + -18%. <br><br>  What is the frequency for a butterfly vibrator resonant?  To answer this question, let us return first to the definitions. <br><br>  Here is a model of any abstract antenna: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ba0/96d/7d9/ba096d7d9c46aa1e36eff028523e769f.png"><br><br>  The total (complex) radiation resistance is equal to the sum of the real part (blue) and the imaginary part (red). <br><br>  The imaginary part consists of two reactive components: inductive (with a + sign) and capacitive (with a - sign). <br><br>  When the inductive and capacitive reactivity are equal, the imaginary part is zero.  The antenna impedance is equal to the actual radiation resistance.  This frequency is called the resonant frequency of the antenna.  For a half-wave dipole, the resonance length of the dipole is 0.5Œª (taking into account the end capacitance in thick conductors - about 0.47Œª, the exact value depends on the L / D ratio), the actual resistance at the resonant frequency is 73Œ©. <br><br>  For a butterfly vibrator, there are two resonances when the inductive component is zero: these are the points of both the maximum resistance and the minimum.  Those.  for a 600 MHz vibrator, the frequencies 600, 1200, 1800 and 900, 1500, 2100, etc. will be resonant.  With a resonant length of each bore multiple of 0.47Œª (with a 33-degree opening angle and a conductor diameter of 2.8 mm), the resistance of the vibrator is maximum possible (around 600Œ©), and with a multiple of 0.47Œª * K + 0.24Œª (a quarter-wavelength shift) possible (around 85Œ©). <br><br>  The exact value of the real resistance R is very sensitive to the diameter of the conductors of which the whiskers are made.  With a very thin conductor D = 0.1 mm, the resistance R at the resonant frequency reaches 1444 Œ©, and with a 10-mm-diameter mustache it reaches only 345 Œ©.  The resonant frequency is also shifted. <br><br>  Here is a table of dependences Rmax (at the resonant frequency), Rmin (at frequencies with a shift of 1/4 from the first resonant frequency) and the corresponding whisker lengths corresponding to these frequencies, depending on the diameter of the conductor. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b3b/484/509/b3b484509012fdb240e69f34eba802fd.png"></div><br>  For a conventional dipole, the diameter of the conductor has almost no effect on the resonant resistance, and the thick dipole reduces the reactive component ‚Äî makes the impedance curve more gentle, and the dipole itself becomes more broadband. <br><br>  For a butterfly vibrator, the diameter of the conductor has a very strong influence on both the resonant and reactive, and hence on the impedance. <br><br>  Let's compare the curves of the full (complex) resistance Z for a vibrator with a 4x223 mm mustache, with a diameter of 1, 3 and 6 mm. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/8dd/7df/ee5/8dd7dfee563a7920953916c668c2942c.png"><br><br>  As you can see, the diameter significantly affects Rmax, and almost does not affect Rmin.  In addition, increasing the diameter of the whiskers reduces the resonant frequency (i.e. the whiskers can be made shorter). <br><br>  In a thicker vibrator, the slope of the slopes is less and the resistance drop in the frequency range is less.  This makes it easy to calculate matching for a wide frequency range. <br><br><h3>  Part Ib Cone Vibrator - DN in Frequency Band </h3><br>  As we know, the DN of a normal dipole is the same in the entire frequency band and does not depend on the distance from the resonant frequency.  Is that true for a butterfly vibrator? <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">DN in the 1st and near the 2nd resonant frequencies</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/468/d9e/68e/468d9e68e756dad0145ba465942526a1.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f7e/178/89b/f7e17889b6cef81c8e270e681b0ffb46.png"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/537/52d/4f3/53752d4f3e43e444a1def316f864db47.png"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f68/961/499/f68961499c7b7c625c7cb28f12d4640c.png"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/9be/0c3/1ba/9be0c31ba6ee121ff4b7b2b8c62b4fc7.png"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/535/621/00f/53562100ff598492d4610d2cfe96b456.png"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c71/18d/951/c7118d9515dc54e3fe477d93bca04b14.png"><br></div></div><br>  As we see, with increasing frequency, the diagram first narrows, and starting from about 0.62Œª, side lobes begin to grow, the intensity of which at the frequency near the second resonance reaches the intensity of the main lobe, and as the frequency grows further, the main lobe almost disappears.  With the passage of each of the next resonant frequency, the petals split into two and the radiation lobes appear upwards. <br><br>  <b>Conclusion:</b> although the butterfly vibrator is formally all-wave, the shape of the radiation pattern begins to split apart after more than 1 wavelength is placed in the total length of the vibrator (both whiskers).  Although the vibrator will emit, the direction of this radiation is unsuitable for practical applications. <br><br>  The practicable range from above is limited by the pattern of the whisker length 0.6Œª. <br><br>  From below it is limited by the fall of the radiation resistance and the growth of the CWS.  With a mustache length shorter than 0.19Œª, the R falls below 25Œ©, and the CWS rises to 4+ even with 50 / 75Œ© power. <br><br><h3>  Suitable for practical use (when deciding the issue of impedance matching) is the wavelength range from 0.2-0.6Œª, i.e.  +28% ..- 57% of the resonant frequency 0.47Œª </h3><br><br><h3>  Part II / Parasites </h3><br>  Parasitic elements are conductors that lie in the E-plane, i.e.  parallel to the vibrator and lie in the polarization of the radiation of the vibrator and electrically isolated from the vibrator. <br><br>  Metallic connection is allowed only for points with zero potential and is only constructive. <br><br>  Parasites significantly affect the dipole, and the effect depends on whether the parasite is longer or shorter than the vibrator.  If the parasite is shorter, then it has capacitive reactivity and increases the radiation towards itself, and if the parasite is longer, it has inductive reactivity and ‚Äúpushes‚Äù the radiation away from itself.  Short parasites are called directors, while long ones are called reflectors.  The more parasites and the closer they are to a dipole, the lower its radiation resistance. <br><br>  Already 1 reflector greatly reduces radiation back and forth and down and adds forward.  Radiation forward increases from 2.15 dBi + 4.7 dB = 6.9 dBi. <br><br>  If the reflector has a length of the vibrator, then it reduces the radiation only up / down, and the forward / backward radiation is equivalent. <br><br>  By reducing the length of the reflector below the length of the vibrator, it turns into a director, the radiation backwards exceeds the radiation forward.  The gain of 1V1D can reach up to 6.2 dBi (slightly less than 1V1R). <br><br>  The directors differ from the reflector in that the further addition of the number of directors leads to a further narrowing of the DN and, accordingly, an increase in the gain.  The second reflector behind the first has almost no effect on the radiation of the antenna. <br><br>  With a conical antenna, parasites behave differently.  The parasite begins to show any properties from a length of about 0.2Œª.  Its optimum distance is 0.15Œª from the vibrator. <br><br>  From 0.3 to 0.47Œª, the parasite works as a director, with a gain peak at 0.448Œª = 8.91 dBi.  At 0.47Œª, the parasite is neutral (suppresses only up / down), and from 0.48Œª and above (to infinity) behaves as a reflector, with a gain peak of 0.49Œª = 8.52 dBi (+3.71 dB against the bare cone) <br><br>  0.0Œª - 4.81 dBi (without parasite) <br>  0.1Œª - 4.83 dBi <br>  0.2Œª - 4.94 dBi <br>  0.3Œª - 5.32 dBi (works as a director) <br>  0.4Œª - 6.89 dBi (works as a director) <br>  0.449Œª - 8.92 dBi (works as a director) <br>  0.47Œª - 7.57 dBi (front / back orientation is the same) <br>  0.49Œª - 8.52 dBi (works as a reflector) <br>  0.5Œª - 8.45 dBi (works as a reflector) <br>  0.6Œª - 7.18 dBi (and further works as a reflector) <br>  0.7Œª - 6.77 dBi <br>  0.8Œª - 6.63 dBi <br>  0.9Œª - 6.57 dBi <br>  1.0Œª - 6.55 dBi <br>  1.2Œª - 6.55 dBi <br>  1.3Œª - 6.60 dBi <br>  1.4Œª - 7.04 dBi <br>  1.5Œª - 7.7 dBi <br>  1.6Œª - 7.14 dBi <br>  2.0Œª - 6.87 dBi <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">0.49Œª Reflector, pattern 3D / ARRL</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ca5/468/14f/ca546814f444ee6aae7e933447f9cff8.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/7b0/551/b3e/7b0551b3e07979240d73a3b47a4762bd.png"></div></div><br>  The radiation resistance increases strongly (the dipole slightly decreased).  So a 0.49Œª reflector raises resistance from 545 to 1150Œ©.  In addition, in a wide band, the properties of the parasite change dramatically with the passage of the point 0.47Œª.  The parasite turns from a reflector into a director and the signal is attenuated in the right direction (but the radiation of the rear hemisphere increases).  Therefore, this design does not make sense for any practical purposes. <br><br>  In order for the reflector to behave in a wide frequency band as a reflector, it is necessary to take at least 1.0Œª at ‚Äã‚Äãthe center frequency.  But the characteristics of such an antenna are very mediocre - the PDC on the front / back is very weak (zero at some frequencies), the SWR exceeds 2.6 at the edges of the range. <br><br>  <b>Conclusion</b> : parasites with the aim of creating an antenna directivity (gain gain and KZD) are very impractical and therefore not used in practice.  Parasites can be carefully used to correct the frequency response in the upper part of the range and to create a blockage of frequencies along the upper edge.  For example, if for a broadband antenna (like Polish ASP-8) for a band of 50 ... 800 MHz add a director who at a frequency of 800 MHz will have a length of &lt;0.45Œª, then at high frequencies, where its effective length is&gt; 0.3Œª it will begin to influence: <br><br>  - will raise the radiation resistance (and as we already know, it falls as we move away from the center frequency) <br>  - will raise the gain due to the focus forward <br>  - when the length begins to approach 0.47Œª, the resistance will increase sharply (and the CWS) and the director will turn into a reflector and reduce the gain forward.  The director will work as a notch filter, with a cut-off frequency F = 300 / L / 0.47 = 141 / L of its length. <br><br>  In the lower frequencies, the length of such a director will have &lt;0.3Œª and almost will not affect the operation of the antenna. <br><br><h3>  Part III / Reflector Screens </h3><br>  The screen reflector is a flat reflector.  It can be made both from a solid conductor (metal sheet, foil) or from a grid of horizontal conductors (if the position of the vibrator whiskers is horizontal).  Vertical conductors do not affect the properties of the screen.  They can only be used for design reasons to give strength to the structure. <br><br>  Like a single parasite, the properties of the screen depend on its width.  If the screen has a width of less than 0.47Œª, it works as a director: the radiation grows in the direction of such a screen.  If the screen has a width of more than 0.47Œª, it works as a reflector. <br><br>  The distance to the reflector can be any from 0.1Œª to 0.5Œª.  With a reflector 1Œª wide and 0.5Œª high (¬± 0.25Œª from the radiation axis) with a grid step of 0.025Œª, the radiation resistance and the gain of a single BowTie will be: <br><br>  0.10Œª - 1700Œ© - 9.83 dBi <br>  0.15Œª - 871Œ© - 9.63 dBi <br>  0.20Œª - 603Œ© - 9.35 dBi <br>  0.25Œª - 496Œ© - 8.94 dBi <br>  0.30Œª - 442Œ© - 8.35 dBi <br>  0.35Œª - 414Œ© - 7.48 dBi <br>  0.40Œª - 404Œ© - 6.15 dBi <br>  0.45Œª - 412Œ© - 4.04 dBi <br>  0.50Œª - 443Œ© - 0.67 dBi <br><br>  A reflector offset from 0.15Œª to 0.35Œª is practically useful.  As the screen approaches &lt;0.15Œª, resistance increases very rapidly to impractical values.  When removing&gt; 0.35Œª, the directivity decreases rapidly and at 0.42Œª it is the same as that of a bare vibrator. <br><br>  For operation at the center frequency, the optimal distance is 0.2Œª - the resistance is very convenient 600Œ©, and the directivity reaches 9.35 dBi.  For operation in a wide frequency band, it is possible to select the optimal position in the interval 0.15 ... 0.25Œª, improving the matching / gain in those parts of the range where a dip is observed. <br><br>  Consider the influence of the width of the reflector, with Offset = 0.2Œª: <br><br>  0.50Œª - 890Œ© - 08.95 dBi - 05.86 F / B <br>  0.75Œª - 657Œ© - 09.11 dBi - 10.57 F / B <br>  1.00Œª - 603Œ© - 09.35 dBi - 12.37 F / B <br>  1.25Œª - 574Œ© - 09.90 dBi - 14.46 F / B <br>  1.50Œª - 583Œ© - 10.18 dBi - 19.33 F / B <br>  1.75Œª - 586Œ© - 10.04 dBi - 19.77 F / B <br>  2.00Œª - 585Œ© - 09.96 dBi - 19.48 F / B <br><br>  With a width of less than 0.47Œª, the screen behaves like a director and concentrates the radiation in its direction. <br><br>  With a length of&gt;

Moreover, the transformation ratio to a lesser extent depends on the resistance of the transformer, and more on its length (relative to the wavelength).  Since  for different frequencies, the same transformer section is a very different length. <br><br>  To calculate this resistance, there is a formula <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/42b/42f/5bf/42b42f5bf1ca3ef575e2f1e305a42929.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d9d/cd9/c6e/d9dcd9c6ee53ff73be93724e46e715a9.jpg"><br><br>  When ZA = Z0, then Zin = Z0.  The line matched to the source does not change the resulting impedance. <br>  In other cases, Z0 is multiplied by a coefficient that depends on f * L (ie, on the wavelength) and depends on ZA and ZO <br><br>  The length of the collecting lines in the in-phase grating can theoretically be any (just to be equal, so that the signals come in-phase and fold), but from technological motives rationally perform them the shortest way, connecting the floors in a straight line.  With this approach, the line length will be set based on the optimal distance between the floors, and it is necessary to improve the matching only by varying the line resistance: by changing the diameter of the conductors or the distance between them. <br><br>  When constructing 3 or more floors, it is technologically very impractical to carry out independent lines from each next floor to the adder.  Fortunately, the signal from the adjacent floors can be added directly to the terminals of the neighbor.  Since  Since floors are placed approximately at a length of 1 / 2Œª between each other, then when passing along a collecting line 1 / 2Œª long, the phase of the signal is reversed by 180 degrees.  In order for such signals to be summed up and not mutually destroyed, it is necessary to connect the conductors in antiphase.  All floors are connected to each other only in antiphase, overlapped lines.  An exception is the power point of the grid (feeder, balun), because  it is at an equal distance from the floors (not necessarily the shortest path), then the signal on it will be in-phase when connected, not overlap, but straight. <br><br>  The shape of the radiation pattern (NAM) of an in-phase antenna array is determined by the DN of the antennas that make up the array, and the configuration of the array itself (number of rows, number of floors and the distance between them). <br><br>  With two omnidirectional antennas placed side by side on 1 / 2Œª (between the axes of the antennas), the DN in the horizontal plane looks like a figure eight, and there is no reception from side directions perpendicular to the main one.  If you increase the distance between the antennas, the width of the main lobe of the radiation pattern decreases, but side lobes appear with maxima in directions perpendicular to the principal. <br><br>  At a distance of 0.6Œª, the level of side lobes is 0.31 of the level of the main lobe, and the width of the DN at half power decreases by 1.2 times relative to the array with a distance between antennas of 2/2. <br><br>  At a distance of 0.75Œª, the level of side lobes increases to 0.71 of the main level, and the width of the DN decreases by 1.5 times.  At a distance of 1Œª, the level of side lobes reaches the level of the main lobe, but the width of the radiation pattern decreases by a factor of 2 compared with the distance between antennas in half-waves. <br><br>  This example shows that it is more expedient to choose the distances between the antennas equal to the wavelength.  This provides the greatest narrowing of the main lobe of the radiation pattern.  There is no need to fear the presence of side lobes, since when using directional antennas in the array, they are not receiving signals from directions perpendicular to the main one. <br><br>  These are general guidelines for any type of antenna.  Antennas are usually mounted this way when they are added through a coaxial cable.  Sections of flexible cable of arbitrary (if only the same) length fit arbitrarily.  Changing the distance between the antennas does not violate the alignment and summation, so you can choose any distance from 0.5 to 1Œª. <br><br>  Consider a particular bottom grille of 2 BowTie vibrators with a reflector depending on the separation between the floors. <br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">2-Bay radiation pattern for 0.4 - 1Œª vertical stack</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/4b9/be6/aee/4b9be6aeecb7826552693d26d7f803ef.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f94/fa2/8ea/f94fa28ea6846590949729ae205a76d7.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/de4/082/f3f/de4082f3fe6359349c23740e8f3ee924.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c81/380/c46/c81380c465b8a338adc7962a440e7393.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/191/acf/cd3/191acfcd3e38f34563051c354e67a3e2.png"><br></div></div><br><br>  As you can see, as the separation increases, the gain increases from 11 dBi@0.4Œª to 12.6@0.6Œª <br>  With a separation of more than 0.6Œª, the amplification of the main lobe does not grow, but it itself becomes narrower in the vertical, and due to this, two parasitic lobes grow up and down.  Although formally the antenna gain of 0.6-1Œª is the same, but a narrower lobe requires a more vain orientation of the antenna to the subscriber (usually the horizon) <br><br>  For a 2-storey grid of conical antennas, you can choose any distance from 0.4 to 1Œª.  But with an increase in the separation above 0.6Œª, the screen size and the length of the carrier beam also increase, i.e.  material consumption, weight increase and strength deteriorates, without increasing parameters. <br><br>  In addition, as we have already seen, an increase in the length of an uncoordinated collecting line significantly affects its transformation ratio.  Therefore, for practical reasons, 2-storeyed lattices are designed with a minimum separation of 0.5-0.6Œª. <br><br>  For 3 or more floors it is not rational to collect signals from individual lines (they should be between the vibrator and the reflector, away from metal objects) from each floor to the tee, and it is structurally easier to sum up the neighboring floors directly to the vibrator.  If the distance is not a multiple of 0.5Œª, then the delay of the signal in the line will not be a multiple of 180 degrees and the signals will not stack in phase.  Therefore, for a direct connection along the shortest path, a spacing of only 0.5 or 1Œª is suitable.  At 0.5Œª, the lines should overlap (to rotate the phase by 180 degrees), at 1Œª directly (without phase rotation).  For the practical reasons described for the 2-storey grid, the spacing of 1Œª is not used. <br><br><h3>  Part VI / Matching with a transformer of resistances </h3><br>  Three types of structures are used to convert the antenna impedance into the feeder impedance: <br>  1) Broadband transformers with a fixed conversion factor.  They are usually performed on ferrite cores or printed on micro-patch lines.  The transformation ratio is determined by the configuration of the straps and the ratio of the number of turns in them. <br>  2) A wide variety of shunt circuits with L and C elements. <br>  3) Transformers using wave line segments <br><br>  The disadvantage of broadband transformers is the cost of their manufacture and the difficulty of obtaining non-multiple (arbitrary) transformation ratios.  Low cost can be obtained only in mass production, and therefore on a limited range.  In fact, only 4: 1 baluns can be called affordable.  The need to produce a balun for another coefficient (6: 1, 8: 1) puts an end to both mass production and homemade homemade products. <br><br>  The disadvantage of shunt circuits is the complexity of manufacturing (as with non-standard baluns), narrowband and the need to adjust the sample on the instruments. <br><br>  Segments of wave lines do not greatly complicate the design of the vibrator (can be its constructive continuation), simplify the technological installation of the box with the balun (or the combined Balun + LNA board) due to the removal of the box beyond the break of the vibrator.  Can be calculated and made to convert almost any resistance to any selection of the length of the segment and its own resistance. <br><br>  Let us consider in more detail the fundamental formula for the transformation of resistance, given in the previous section. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/db1/86c/c78/db186cc787b5b26990d8c009e97283da.png" alt="image"><br><br>  From this formula follow a series of observations: <br><ul><li>  With a line length of 0 or a multiple of 1 / 2Œª, the resulting resistance is equal to the source resistance, the line does not make a change in the impedance, because the tangent of the multiples of 180 is zero </li><li>  When the length of the line with a shift of 1 / 4Œª from multiples of 1 / 2Œª - the resulting resistance changes as much as possible, because the tangent of angles 90 and 270 tends to infinity </li><li>  A line with a resistance equal to the source resistance (consistent) does not make a change in the resultant coincidence at any line length </li><li>  A line of fixed geometric length will behave differently in a wide frequency band when changing the wavelength.  If the line length in lambda approaches 0 or a multiple of 1 / 2Œª with a change in frequency, the line contribution decreases, if the length approaches 1 / 4Œª - the line contribution increases sharply.  This property can potentially be used to equalize the vibrator‚Äôs own impedance. </li></ul><br><br>  Create Excel to work with this formula: <a href="https://goo.gl/w8z9U2">goo.gl/w8z9U2</a> (Google Docs) <br><br>  Suppose our BowTie vibrator has Z = 750 + j0 at the frequency of the first resistance resonance. <br>  To convert 750 Ohms to 300 (for connection to a 4: 1 balun), you can use a symmetric waveguide of only 0.1Œª (5 cm for a frequency of 600 MHz) with a resistance of 231 Ohms. <br>  Using the above <b>coax_calc</b> calculator, <b>you</b> can choose a combination of wire diameter and distance between them to get 231 Ohms. <br><br><h3>  Part VII / Case Studies </h3><br>  The scope of use of cone antennas is very limited.  At frequencies below 300 MHz, such antennas have unacceptably large dimensions compared to a half-wave dipole, which has a span of 0.5Œª versus 1Œª. <br><br>  At frequencies above 800 MHz there are almost no radio technologies where high directional antennas are needed.  CDMA, GSM, GPS, LTE, WiFi are needed, or omnidirectional antennas at the subscriber, or sector antennas with a clearly predictable sector shape on the operator‚Äôs side. <br>  A small demand for highly directional antennas exists among fixed cellular subscribers.  Using BowTie radiators, it is theoretically possible to manufacture LTE-700, CDMA2000 / LTE 800 Mhz antennas, GSM / UMTS / LTE-900 and CDMA2000 / LTE 450 Mhz antennas.  The industry of such antennas did not produce, and in <b>Part VIII</b> we will try to construct such an antenna, at the same time checking how efficient and competitive such a design is. <br><br>  At frequencies above 2 GHz, cone antennas can be made only by printing (microstrip), there are no advantages in parameters or simplicity of design and manufacture compared to patch antennas at such frequencies. <br><br>  In the range between 300 and 800 MHz, only television broadcasting works: PAL / SECAM / NTSC (analog) or DVB-T / T2 / T2 HD (digital). <br><br>  It is the market of subscriber antennas of TV broadcasting that brought unbelievable popularity to conical antennas. <br><br>  In the 1960s, such antennas acquired most of the market in geographically large countries: Canada and the USA.  Large areas, predominantly flat, led to a lower density of television towers compared to Europe.  For large radii of coverage, high gain antennas were required by 10 ... 16 dB.  To achieve such a gain from single antennas, the wave channel is very problematic, and it is difficult and expensive to use common-mode arrays of 2-4 antennas compared to the simplicity of a multi-level cone antenna with a reflector. <br><br>  The widest distribution of such antennas in Eastern Europe was facilitated by the emergence of a large number of low-power TV channels in the UHF range (1-5 kW compared to 20-25 kW for the three central television channels), which require antennas with a gain of 10+ dB, as well as broadband with the capture (albeit low-gain) sections of the MV range, which eliminated the need to contain an additional antenna of the MV range, additional cables, amplifiers, adders, etc. <br><br>  We present the reader 7 antenna designs, carefully optimized (using Python scripts using NEC-engine for modeling) to maximize the average gain in the range of 470-700 MHz (21-50 UHF channels) and minimize the average SWR.  For 2017, such antennas are relevant only for DVB-T / T2 reception. <br><br>  <b>Without reflector:</b> <br><br>  1) 2-Bay: 50x55 cm, whiskers 8x279 mm <br>  2) 3-Bay: 60x50 cm, whiskers 12x241 mm <br>  3) 3-Bay (1 small): 80x65 cm, whiskers 4x276, 4x302 and 4x190 mm <br><br>  <b>With reflector / screen:</b> <br><br>  4) 1-Bay: 25x72 cm (50 + 2x12.5 cm sides), whiskers 4x222 mm (from the example in the article) <br>  5) 2-Bay: 86x57 cm, whiskers 4x254 mm <br>  6) 4-Bay: 102x86 cm <br>  7) 6-Bay: 152x84 cm <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Gain, swr</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/9c2/1a6/91e/9c21a691ef4b5dff6c35755f63088d13.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/532/d69/ddc/532d69ddc87098555fee142586242c74.png"></div></div><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/160/a57/88b/160a5788ba7193c4fe01ec27368ab4e6.png"></div><br>  The antenna gain averaged over the 470-700 MHz band is 7 to 42 times, or 8.5 to 16.3 dBi. <br>  The third column shows the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe frontal projection in m2, and in the last - the specific gain, in times per 1 m2 of the frontal area. <br><br>  For comparison, the antenna wave channel (Uda-Yagi), specially optimized for the same range, has an average gain of 10 dBi (from 8.1 to 12.1) in the 1R-5D configuration (1 reflector, 5 directors, loop vibrator, 624x293x45 mm) and 12.7 dBi in 2R-15D configuration (2 reflectors, 15 directors, loop vibrator, L = 1621 mm) <br><br>  <b>Conclusions:</b> when designing antennas with medium amplification up to 10 dBi, traditional dipole antennas wave channel is simpler, smaller, lighter, easier to manufacture (both artisanal and industrial) and more durable.  If gain&gt; 10 dBi is required, then adding directors to Uda-Yagi adds very little directivity (1R5D = 10 dBi, 2R10D = 11.5 dBi, 2R15D = 12.7 dBi), whereas even a 2-story cone antenna with a reflector gives an average gain of 13.1 dBi . <br><br>  When an average gain of 15-16 dBi is required, there are no alternatives to 4 and 6-storey conical antennas.  In the antenna segment with a gain of 10-13 dB, a 2-storey conical antenna is smaller and simpler than long wave channels for 10 or more directors). <br><br>  Here is a general view and a DN of seven antennas, in the order numbered above: <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">3D View, Pattern @ 600 MHz</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  1) 2-Bay: 50x55 cm, whiskers 8x279 mm <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e5a/fa8/8eb/e5afa88eb33d3e095f4016ff099b284b.png"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ab3/802/646/ab38026469d920d62ec77cfc37e70009.png"><br>  2) 3-Bay: 60x50 cm, whiskers 12x241 mm <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/402/dfe/64a/402dfe64a7a8825107e79d3792d2ace2.png"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/cbf/351/cdb/cbf351cdbb59a26805b23d25a344bc8d.png"><br><br>  3) 3-Bay (1 small): 80x65 cm, whiskers 4x276, 4x302 and 4x190 mm <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/254/5e5/90d/2545e590dff8eb4f24a833e98eafac22.png"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/6ea/e87/a30/6eae87a30e30904fd5b1afc65604e087.png"><br><br>  4) 1-Bay: 25x72 cm (50 + 2x12.5 cm sides), whiskers 4x222 mm (from the example in the article) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/9ce/bec/118/9cebec118cd000267b539ea4c4f69551.png"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/415/cb1/181/415cb1181e74385eb8ecddea137ed43a.png"><br><br>  5) 2-Bay: 86x57 cm, whiskers 4x254 mm <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/944/b3c/6e9/944b3c6e90201a0a8c59f65174bfc9a5.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/0ea/9f2/f3e/0ea9f2f3e9f32b86a53f1e7cc351d9bd.png"><br>  6) 4-Bay: 102x86 cm <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/77a/9f0/b06/77a9f0b06206f64b66507e4d72f26e45.png"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/4da/92f/33f/4da92f33f1c4c5b6b76ecab25e39a485.png"><br><br>  7) 6-Bay: 152x84 cm <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/871/828/c58/871828c5861cced8f315023986756312.png"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a81/22f/756/a8122f7569d7ce758c963094396d5bf9.png"><br></div></div><br>  All 7 models in the * .NEC format can be downloaded <a href="https://goo.gl/StmBJ2">here</a> and see the detailed dimensions (including creating executive drawings) using the <a href="http://www.qsl.net/4nec2/">free program 4NEC2</a> . <br><br>  <b>Disclaimer</b> : The 6 UHF-TV antennas presented were developed by <a href="http://www.digitalhome.ca/forum/186-antenna-research-development/">DigitalHome Canada</a> forum participants under the guidance of <b>holl_ands</b> and <b>mclapp users</b> . <br><br><h2>  <b>Part VIII / Industrial Antenna Analysis</b> </h2><br>  4-storey ASP-8 type antennas have gained wide popularity in the CIS. <br>  These antennas have many modifications, which differ slightly from each other (in trifles). <br>  Older antennas had longer upper-floor whiskers (and were labeled 47-860 MHz antennas). <br>  The new antennas (which are sold in 2017) have the upper floor a little shorter than the old ones, probably for better performance in the UHF, where DVB-T / DVB-T2 are now working. <br><br>  For the analysis, the sizes from such a sample cost $ 3.6 were taken (for the price -
