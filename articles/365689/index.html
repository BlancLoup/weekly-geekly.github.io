      The employee of the Belarusian cellular operator Pavel was very useful engineering education and IT-related profession.  And yet, smart homes are a little different from cellular communication, so he had to solve every task of automating his home for the first time in his life - so his project stretched out for several years, becoming a constant hobby. <br><br>  Paul: <blockquote>  ‚ÄúThe idea to automate the house came to me another year in 2010, and has since become interested in the topic.  At first, I set myself the task of adjusting the control of the lighting and the electric lock of the door from my smartphone.  I read, prepared, then bought the equipment.  I wanted to do everything on the infrared remote, but then I met Iridium and decided to work on it.  The implementation itself, installation and installation of equipment, took only a couple of days.  And then everything was added one by one. " <br></blockquote><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/528/2e5/e70/5282e5e7046245ea81d1d51a91718e3a.png"><br><br>  What was added: control of the intercom (as well as mute on the TV and computer when the intercom is ringing), TV, computer media server (XBMC), RGB LEDs, hidden ip video surveillance in the hallway and living room with remote control.  How it looks now - clearly in the video. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/-8bx9QlQ9oc%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700021,15700186,15700191,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhgXGN6QZCUNnbOls5JemBlMKih7TA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  In the video, we did not see climate control, and asked Paul about it.  It turned out that the thermostat works separately, year-round in its long-tuned and energy-saving mode, and the owners simply do not see the point of managing it. <br><br>  List of used equipment: <br><table><tbody><tr><th>  Equipment </th><th>  amount </th></tr><tr><td>  Automation System ModBus Russian manufacturer Insyte: <br>  Spyder2 Controller <br>  Relay module LDU-2400M <br>  Dimmer LD2-D400R <br>  IR transceiver LD2-IR <br>  LD2-SS Drive Control Module </td><td>  1 PC. <br>  1 PC. <br>  4 things. <br>  2 pcs. <br>  1 PC. <br>  1 PC. </td></tr><tr><td>  RGB Wifi controller - noname (China) with 5m tape </td><td>  1 PC. </td></tr><tr><td>  IP cameras - Boavision (China) </td><td>  2 pcs. </td></tr><tr><td>  motion sensor - ins-101 </td><td>  1 PC. </td></tr><tr><td>  Components for homemade chips </td><td></td></tr><tr><td>  Power supplies (for automation systems, for LEDs, for cameras) </td><td>  4 things. </td></tr><tr><td>  Wires: <br>  PCM wire (ModBus bus) <br>  Twisted pair (for cameras) </td><td>  70m <br>  25m </td></tr><tr><td>  HUB TP-Link TL-SF1008D </td><td>  1 PC. </td></tr><tr><td>  Router from internet provider </td><td>  1 PC. </td></tr><tr><td>  IRidium license for AV &amp; CustomSystems </td><td>  1 PC. </td></tr></tbody></table><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a79/07a/d69/a7907ad690df4a4280a42cb1f7c1ea0a.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d6c/24c/c89/d6c24cc8909f4d0ea80d44ce12bec580.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/5da/bab/736/5dabab7362414da1885f1ec36d69e16b.png"><br>  <i>It can be seen that such an interesting graphical interface took a lot of time.</i> <br><br>  We noted the outstanding, high-quality, smart home control interface made.  As it turned out, it was the drawing of the interface that took most of the time. <br><br>  Paul: <blockquote>  ‚ÄúI made the interface for myself, so for me personally it‚Äôs very convenient.  Drawn the location of all the buttons, changing menus, how I want it, how I see it.  Distributed among the subsystems that are interconnected: climate, perimeter, light, audio-video equipment. ‚Äù </blockquote><br>  The plans for the near future - to introduce air conditioning control, to prescribe for him scenarios with automatic regulation of the sensors from the window.  Next in line is the control of electric fire, rolshtor, satellite TV (including the display on the TV screen streaming streams and images of IP-cameras. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/326/6ca/1f0/3266ca1f0ebe4e36a18e3427df4d229b.png"><br><br>  And all this - for the equivalent of about 100 TR, and not for a few bags of money.  Of course, personal time expenses were not included in the project budget.  Of the equipment, the main costs went to the ModBus automation system from Insyte.  All the rest of the equipment (RGB Wi-fi controller, IP cameras, motion sensor, components for a homemade chip, power supplies, routers and wires) cost no more than $ 100 separately, including the <a href="http://www.iridiummobile.ru/">Iridium</a> license for the promotion for the participants of the training webinar. <br><br>  But you can not just take and automate your own home (at least for now). <br><br>  Paul: <blockquote>  ‚ÄúAt first there were difficulties, because of inattention and mistakes, we often had to re-write the scenarios, because they were in conflict with those that were laid in Iridium.  It helped time, experiments, when all the time something you try, constantly re-read the theory.  If a person wants to automate his home space, the most important thing is his desire and interest in business.  Because it actually takes a lot of time, especially the theoretical part, drawing the graphical interface, programming, setting up the equipment, mounting points, wires, and so on.  If it is interesting and enjoyable, of course, you can do everything yourself and save considerably on work and specialists.  If there is no free time or if such a hobby is not to your liking, of course, it‚Äôs better to turn to specialists. ‚Äù </blockquote><br>  <i>Self-made dream</i> <br> <a href="http://www.iridiummobile.ru/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/214/22c/54b/21422c54b5394869b047fdf5324b87b4.png"></a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/365689/">https://habr.com/ru/post/365689/</a></p>
