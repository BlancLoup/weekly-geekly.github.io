It is planned that there will be about 40 of the most noticeable phenomena.  So far 14 computer games are on the list.  Including <a href="http://www.moma.org/collection/object.php%3Fobject_id%3D152403">Tetris Alexei Pazhitnova</a> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/1e4/6e1/4ad/1e46e14ad4eb3796a72b6c8733e73d73.jpg"><br><br>  When selecting games for the collection, not only the design of the picture was taken into account.  Such things necessary for the game as gameplay, user-friendly interface, the ability of the game to engage the player and create mood were taken into account.  Interestingly, the selection of games also took into account the quality short code.  Moreover, the beauty of the code is also planned to flaunt.  The selection of games took into account the views of not only art historians, but also programmers.

      It is not very clear how the games will be displayed.  <a href="http://www.moma.org/explore/inside_out/2012/11/29/video-games-14-in-the-collection-for-starters">List of games already selected</a> : <br><br><ul><li>  Pac-Man (1980) </li><li>  Tetris (1984) </li><li>  Another World (1991) </li><li>  Myst (1993) </li><li>  SimCity 2000 (1994) </li><li>  vib-ribbon (1999) </li><li>  The Sims (2000) </li><li>  Katamari Damacy (2004) </li><li>  EVE Online (2003) </li><li>  Dwarf Fortress (2006) </li><li>  Portal (2007) </li><li>  flOw (2006) </li><li>  Passage (2008) </li><li>  Canabalt (2009) </li></ul><br><br>  It is also already known that the organizers of the future collection want to include in the museum exposition "Snake", "Space Supplies", "Zork", "Super Mario", "Grim Fandango". <br><br>  And also announced that the youngest game in the collection will be Minecraft. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Well, and a short translation of the descriptions of games on the website of the Museum of Modern Art in New York.  These are not complete translations, but only what seemed to me interesting. <br><code>&nbsp;</code><br><br><h2>  Pac-man </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/a86/8bb/68b/a868bb68bbb60e7a4ee8e13c42c9fcd3.jpg"><br><br>  At the time of the creation of this game, the most popular arcade shooters were, such as Space Invaders and Asteroids.  Game author Toru Ivatani wanted to develop a game without violence.  The idea of ‚Äã‚ÄãPacman was born in his restaurant, and inspired, of course, pizza. <br>  <a href="http://www.moma.org/collection/browse_results.php%3Fobject_id%3D164917">Original</a> <br><br><h2>  Tetris </h2><br>  In the translation of the article, I was surprised that the playing field, where the figures of Tetris, which we call ‚ÄúGlass‚Äù, are assembled, they have there called not a lot of Matrix.  And further the following words are interesting: <br><br>  This abstract puzzle, created in 1985 by Pajitnov, is highly addictive.  And when playing for a long time, it becomes almost a meditative practice.  Tetris has become the most universal of all video games, appealing to players of any age, gender and geography.  It is adapted for almost any computer system. <br>  <a href="http://www.moma.org/collection/browse_results.php%3Fobject_id%3D152403">Original</a> <br><br><h2>  Another world </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/f08/fc6/d3a/f08fc6d3adb4cda27797f27470871e62.jpg"><br><br>  The game used innovative advanced effects and sounds, as well as graphics.  The game was known for its unique atmosphere and minimalist aesthetics.  Author Eric Shahi (√âric Chahi) developed the Underworld independently, thereby retaining almost complete creative control over the game. <br>  <a href="http://www.moma.org/collection/browse_results.php%3Fobject_id%3D162458">Original</a> <br><br><h2>  Myst </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/832/908/7c5/8329087c557ae176e120bcf9d44bfa4f.jpg"><br><br>  The best-selling computer game of the 90s.  Myst introduced a new and complex sense of space and movement in computer games, using advanced graphics and 3D animation.  It was a breakthrough in video game design.  In the 90s, entire communities of fans grew around the game.  The code for the graphics of the game was so great that it was distributed on CD-ROM discs, which was very cool for that time (1993). <br>  <a href="http://www.moma.org/collection/browse_results.php%3Fobject_id%3D164918">Original</a> <br><br><h2>  SimCity 2000 </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/2e0/361/325/2e03613257eab4d89d8d081cebda1f91.jpg"><br><br>  Unlike most games, SimCity has no specific goal, except for the development of a strong and healthy city.  The game was first released in 1989 for personalk.  SimCity 2000 is similar to the original version, but has a number of improvements, such as the apparent height of the earth and underground construction.  Players can develop a city politically or strategically.  They can change the social order, or they can cause mass chaos for their own entertainment. <br>  <a href="http://www.moma.org/collection/browse_results.php%3Fobject_id%3D152406">Original</a> <br><br><h2>  Vib ribbon </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/a7b/7dc/bd8/a7b7dcbd839d550f3b78cbc46e87a74d.jpg"><br><br>  Matsuura, a designer and musician based in Tokyo, is one of the creators of this music video game.  The player can put any of his music on the computer (for example, from a CD), and the game determines the tempo of the track.  White lines on a black background form a road along which the main character moves, a rabbit named Vibri.  The player overcomes obstacles, their frequency depends on the selected audio track.  Pressing the right buttons at the right time will allow Virby to go safe and sound.  The faster the beat, the faster the player must respond.  If the game fails, Virby turns into a frog, and then into a worm.  If the game is successful, Virby will turn into a fairy princess.  At the end of each level, Virby sings a congratulatory song that is getting longer and longer. <br>  <a href="http://www.moma.org/collection/browse_results.php%3Fobject_id%3D162460">Original</a> <br><br><h2>  The sims </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/3a7/410/aa3/3a7410aa331ac183582d139a3329df40.jpg"><br><br>  As in SimCity, there is neither a specific goal, nor a universal method of achieving success, just different situations are possible, depending on the player‚Äôs creative abilities.  The Sims was designed as a building game, like SimCity, but limited to a suburban house, not the entire city.  Monitoring the behavior of family members, however, turned out to be more interesting. <br>  <a href="http://www.moma.org/collection/browse_results.php%3Fobject_id%3D162461">Original</a> <br><br><h2>  Katamari Damacy </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/d13/aef/c93/d13aefc932ef96be2c772b9bdc625823.jpg"><br><br>  I‚Äôm risking to independently translate what I understood, although I‚Äôm most likely to make a lot of mistakes in this Surrey: <br><br>  The author of the game Keita Takahashi (Keita Takahashi), was given complete creative freedom, and he did not disappoint.  The plot is something like this: the king of space flew from space to earth in order to collect all the balls here (they are nothing else).  In fact, the king of space walks and collects piles of garbage.  Surrealistic forms interact with realistic and delight! <br>  <a href="http://www.moma.org/collection/browse_results.php%3Fobject_id%3D164919">Original</a> <br><br><h2>  EVE Online </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/af0/442/975/af04429752f0c3877c0eb0b032ab6ed6.jpg"><br><br>  EVE Online is a massively multiplayer online game.  More than half a million people around the world hang out in it.  The creator of the game CCP Games has attracted not only designers and developers, as well as economists and anthropologists.  CCP Games explains that ‚Äúthe power belongs to the players.  Nothing compares to a player who gets an opportunity to influence the Universe.  We create tools for players to create content. ‚Äù <br>  <a href="http://www.moma.org/collection/browse_results.php%3Fobject_id%3D162462">Original</a> <br><br><h2>  Dwarf fortress </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/970/d2e/03c/970d2e03c6582e32442d33414f917c1f.jpg"><br><br>  The earliest computer games displayed images using ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange).  The developers of Dwarf Fortress, a single-player fantasy game, purposely neglected modern graphics by choosing retro-aesthetic.  Instead of relying on a naturalistic three-dimensional interface, the game generates its own complex world, which the player can change. <br>  <a href="http://www.moma.org/collection/browse_results.php%3Fobject_id%3D164920">Original</a> <br><br><h2>  Portal </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/aaa/77e/d0b/aaa77ed0bd005f50c3b4b46e7cbbd29c.jpg"><br><br>  Unfortunately, there is nothing interesting in the description of the awesome game on the site of contemporary art, therefore I will omit the translation. <br>  <a href="http://www.moma.org/collection/browse_results.php%3Fobject_id%3D162463">Original</a> <br><br><h2>  flOw </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/8a3/6a3/696/8a36a36963412f97e1467e5ec5a6b643.jpg"><br><br>  Again, I will resort to a free translation.  The player needs to develop a creature that floats freely in the water.  the game adjusts to each player individually.  If you develop more well, then the rhythms of the game is accelerated.  You in the game must reach the maximum stress of their intellectual abilities. <br>  <a href="http://www.moma.org/collection/browse_results.php%3Fobject_id%3D164921">Original</a> <br><br><h2>  Passage </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/de7/a36/dfd/de7a36dfdb5c0652a78569a57784d80a.jpg"><br><br>  For 5 minutes of this game in front of you will fly the whole life of your character.  Unlike other games, there are no extra lives: "You will die only once, at the very end, and you cannot prevent the inevitable loss."  Posthardrok some, in spite of the cheerful pixel design. <br>  <a href="http://www.moma.org/collection/browse_results.php%3Fobject_id%3D145533">Original</a> <br><br><h2>  Canabalt </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/34b/091/bfe/34b091bfe4bc07d1dbbafecf965a60c2.jpg"><br><br>  Canabalt is a new interpretation of the early video games, in which the character runs from left to right through dozens of screen shifts.  As in classic arcades, you must overcome obstacles, avoid falls.  The meaning of the game is clear, you just need to calculate the speed of the run and the height of the jump, but not everything is as simple as it seems.  Here it is important to take into account many factors, including sounds.  The game Saltsman was developed in just a week, (including graphics, which consists of only 6 shades of gray).  It takes a hundred kilobytes.  The remaining three megabytes of the game are music and graphics. <br>  <a href="http://www.moma.org/collection/browse_results.php%3Fobject_id%3D164922">Original</a> <br><br><h2>  Postscript </h2><br>  Discussion in the comments turned into a requirement to add to the list of favorite games of habra users.  In my opinion, this is not an entirely correct requirement.  Still, the Museum of Contemporary Art is a private organization, although one of the most reputable. <br><br> <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/171853/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/f98/093/472/f9809347257dfcea25f089ac59c776c6.png"></a> <br><br>  On the other hand, we are entitled to know which games we, the habrew users, like.  Therefore, I created a separate post in which we can create our own separate <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/171853/">rating of the best computer games of all times and peoples according to the version of the 2013 habrasoobschestva</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/171765/">https://habr.com/ru/post/171765/</a></p>
