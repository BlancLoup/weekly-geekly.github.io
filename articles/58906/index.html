      Well what to tell you?  Your enthusiasm and initiative is commendable. <br>  Another thing that gives the impression that this newsletter is entirely devoted <br>  questions of philosophy.  Of course this is not your fault - what excites you, then you and <br>  you write - and you spread it. <br>  On the other hand, candidate minimums (CM) are precisely this that basically unites graduate students, and each has its own specialization and is looking for information on it itself ... <br><br>  I, too, in the first two years of graduate school I was engaged in everything, but not <br>  science (attending classes in philosophy, English, etc. - does not count.) Therefore, <br>  You are the first and you are not the last to step on this rake. <br>  I also have two graduate students sitting next to me - they devote 80% of their time <br>  philosophy and english. <br><br>  From the height of my bell tower, I can say that philosophy is not basic and <br>  a year after passing the CM you won‚Äôt remember what the flow of philosophy is <br>  invented man.  In general, if I were you, I would research the question of passing the exams. <br>  external on all KM except English - never practice <br>  hurt ... <br><br>  But if you knock out this topic from your list, then the question may arise - what to write about ... <br>  Let's think - what else might interest young people, just <br>  graduated from university and who became graduate students ... <br>  First, why do people go to graduate school?  (By the way, you can ask such a question <br>  in the mailing list!) It is interesting to know the results ... <br><br>  My assumptions are: <br>  1. People have not yet understood what they want to achieve in life and by inertia. <br>  continue to follow the proposed training road ... (20%) <br>  2. Some practical interest (60%) <br>  - nonresident - catch and stay in the "Big City" <br>  - avoid mandatory distribution <br>  - get a deferment from the army <br>  - go abroad <br>  3. Conscious - people fascinated by science (such units) ... (1-2%) <br>  4. Something else.  (18%). <br><br>  I can say that I myself did not know what a graduate school was, <br>  what for I need it and even more so I did not expect that all my life I will <br>  to be engaged in science (though about the last and not sure now - but this is already from <br>  areas "The more I know - the less I know"). <br><br>  And according to this, according to the latest statistics of a scientific institution of the Academy of Sciences <br>  of all graduate students, 30% live to the end of the graduate school, the remaining 70% are eliminated ... <br>  I emphasize - they are not protected, but simply graduate from graduate school without presenting to the world <br>  the results of their activities !!! <br>  In universities, I think a little better situation, and then only by the fact that there <br>  talented students are plowed in for scientific purposes already from the 3rd year <br>  (I even tried the second one ...) and the requirements for my dissertation are lower there ... <br><br>  Total running a couple of years in classes (philosophy, English, etc.) and after living on one <br>  graduate scholarship - most simply die out ... Which confirms <br>  statistics ... I myself probably would have died out <br>  no coincidence - an interesting topic, the ability to introduce in <br>  practice results (and accordingly support the pants without departing from the topic), <br>  a couple of interesting business trips abroad and one more thing ... <br><br>  And then a certain turning point occurred in the mind ... The fact is that if you constantly <br>  to think about some kind of problem, your brains are physically rearranged ... <br>  This has been proven by many studies ... <br><br>  When preparing an experiment, an article, a disser, etc.  your brain all the time <br>  forced to critically evaluate the results of both others and their own ... (Here, <br>  Of course, much depends on the strictness of the requirements of your supervisor <br>  and his approach to your training) ... In short, the so-called <br>  critical mindset ... Maybe he, of course, and with age produces <br>  too, but I am more than sure that not all ... <br>  In everyday life, you also start asking yourself questions - and why is this? <br>  so and not otherwise?  What would happen if?  and so on ... This is what <br>  the main value of postgraduate studies in particular and of science in general as such.  it <br>  hard to explain.  You can illustrate with such an example - if you graduate from a university, can you <br>  explain to your classmate who after school went to the factory or <br>  to the market - what is university study and what does it really give?  (You something <br>  really feel like you grew up intellectually compared to <br>  his state at graduation).  I think it is unlikely you will succeed <br>  convincingly that he will give up everything and sit down for textbooks preparing for <br>  admission ... There is a similar situation ... <br><br>  In connection with the above, you can ask the question "If I already got into <br>  graduate school - what am I to do about it? ‚Äù <br>  My personal view on this situation is - Apply the principle formulated <br>  Dale Carnegie (I hope the name is familiar, if not recommended to read) <br>  "If you got a lemon, make lemonade out of it." <br>  ... <br><br>  So you're in graduate school - ‚ÄúYou are in army now!‚Äù ¬© Status Quo <br><br>  No matter how you came to this, it is important that you can do in this situation ... <br><br>  Usually, in the first year, graduate students do little, especially if: <br>  a) scientific leader (HP) - a great scientist and the same head.  He simply has no time for you ... <br>  This is generally the saddest case ... For here is your motto - "Saving the drowning is the work of the drowning themselves." <br>  b) you and your research manager got acquainted with the subject a couple of months before entering graduate school. <br>  It also happens.  And quite often - especially in the last post-perestroika years ... <br>  c) your head in constant travels.  Especially in long-term - from 3 months to 1 year, business trips ... <br>  d) you are an applicant, or a graduate student is a part-time student.  And besides your scientific duties, you must plow in your main job ... <br>  d) something else ... <br><br>  The opposite situation (I can even say the ideal situation) is when <br>  a) you met HP and began working on the potential topic of your dissertation for another 3 courses. <br>  b) you wrote and defended not a diploma, but a scientific work ... <br>  c) by the time of admission you already have a couple of publications and speeches at conferences <br>  d) you are once taken to the laboratory at 0.5 rates mn.s and immediately connected to a couple of projects, <br>  those.  question add.  earnings for the information of the ends you should not ... :) (sorry for the pun) <br>  e) you (you) quit (abandoned) all (all) ... girls (girls) in the world once and for all, and hormones no longer bother you <br>  (To be honest - a very sad case ... I don‚Äôt want anyone to fulfill this item) ... <br>  e) you are isolated from all your relatives and old friends ... <br>  g) and, in general, the meaning of life except in science you no longer have ... (and this is 20 years old with kopecks ... HORROR !!!!!) <br><br>  N-yes, as the saying goes, ‚Äúbegan for health, finished for the peace‚Äù ... <br><br>  * Note: If someone has at least the first three or four points from the ideal situation, then you can not read further ... <br><br>  So, the first year, two, three (as if you are not lucky) you are left to yourself ... And except in the delivery of KM there is no sense in graduate school ... <br><br>  But, in fact, graduate school has its very significant advantages ... <br><br>  1. As I said, the main plus is the change in the angle of view of the circulation of things in nature ... <br>  2. The development of the ability to express their thoughts coherently in public ... <br>  3. Developing independent work skills ... <br>  4. The possibility of relatively easy (in relation to other options) to work, to travel abroad and, accordingly, to see the world with my own eyes, and not with ‚Äúthe eyes of Senkevich‚Äù (c) G. Khazanov, or someone else's ... <br><br>  Let us dwell on the pros a bit more ... <br><br>  1. Changing the angle of view ... <br>  If this happened to you (by the way, it doesn‚Äôt have to be! Just by the fact that you went for three years for a scholarship and sat in seminars on philosophy ... In general, "no one owes anything to anyone" (c) my wife :). <br>  By the way, the opposite statement that this can happen only thanks to graduate school (or science) is not true.  There are plenty of smart people and without higher education who see how the world works and how it can be used for selfish or other (noble) purposes.  For an example, you don‚Äôt need to go far - ‚Äútell me his name?‚Äù - ‚ÄúBoo ....‚Äù, ugh, - ‚ÄúBill‚Äù, ‚ÄúGates‚Äù ... <br><br>  So, if this happened to you, then various nasty things start to torment you, you can even say thoughts that are harmful to a quiet life - ‚ÄúWhat is the meaning of my worthless (for now!) Life‚Äù and something like ‚ÄúIf I'm so smart, then why not so rich ‚Äù... <br><br>  If the first question prevails, you will not be doomed to do scientific work - to write articles, books, and if you are lucky to make major scientific discoveries, up to and including Nobel and other similar awards ... Although I suspect that real scientific geniuses do not ask this question either (like leaving their croup-shaped mark in history) does not torment them ... <br><br>  If you are more concerned with the second question - then you have a direct path to various kinds of entrepreneurs, inventors, etc.  By the way, if you look at the composition of the directorate of the current normal firms (I do not mean buy-sell firms, but at least do something-sell), then in the overwhelming majority someone at the top is a scientific degree yes it has ... By the way, it concerns the western firms weakly - they have another system of personnel training, and scientists are fed better there (their second question doesn‚Äôt torment them much), but in any case the abbreviation Ph.D.  The employee questionnaire is welcome ... <br><br>  In addition, even working at a company, you yourself can already assess your prospects up to retirement and work for one salary you are somehow uncomfortable, I want a certain percentage of the positive (hardly a side effect :) of your activity ... And in principle, you really imagine how this can be achieved.  The question whether you will be able to achieve this is from another opera, we don‚Äôt sing it here yet ... <br><br>  But in any case, by myself I can say that ‚Äúa good splinter is sitting in the ass, comrades‚Äù - I want to itch and run, run and itch with one single purpose - to improve my own moral well-being ... <br>  ‚ÄúAnd you need this?‚Äù The truth is, people say - all grief is from the mind. <br><br>  2. The development of the ability to express their thoughts coherently in public ... <br><br>  I suspect that even without the public, the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãposing a problem ... An example?  - You are welcome.  Take a tape recorder, sit in front of him in splendid isolation and tape your speech, for example, on ‚ÄúThe Influence of Object-Oriented Programming Methods on the General Rate of Progress,‚Äù or something like that ... And then prepare a written transcript of your speech on this tape ... I promise you will find out a lot of interesting things about yourself ... <br>  The topic may be different - the main thing is that you yourself seriously feel the mechanism of the formation of thoughts in your head ... In ordinary speech, this does not happen - people very rarely think before they speak, more often the opposite happens, even less often when it happens at the same time ... <br><br>  And a public performance for an unprepared (horror) and an unhardened person is a torment that ranks second after the fear of death ... <br>  Remember your diploma defense ... By the way, a couple of practical tips to overcome this fear can be found at the same Carnegie ... <br><br>  In graduate school (or after - in preparing the disser for protection) you will speak.  Get it.  And they will do it right ... For there is nothing to disgrace your colleagues at all sorts of conferences, pre-defense, and even more so - at the defense itself ... Ideally, every quarter you will be heard at scientific seminars at your institute, laboratory, group, etc.  Unfortunately, this is not always the case ... <br>  But a couple of times at conferences you will definitely speak ... And best of all, if the conference is international and you have to speak the enemy‚Äôs language ... The most difficult thing is not to speak - after all, you can always memorize, and after speaking at the discussions you can translate and understand questions and preferably not stuttering strongly give more or less a suitable answer in the allotted 5 minutes ... <br>  The closer to defense, the more speeches you will have to do ... And the calmer they begin to pass for you ... Although residual disturbance phenomena will be present, but it will be much easier for you to endure them ... <br><br>  In addition, you will understand what it means to ‚Äúanswer for your words‚Äù in the literal sense of these words ... For science does not tolerate inaccuracies, and for every incorrectly used term, either you yourself will feel like an idiot, or you will subtly hint about it ... <br>  By will, not by will, but it all develops the habit of thinking about your own words and in ordinary life ... What, in principle, is good ... <br>  The bad thing is that you automatically think about other people's words ... And your reputation automatically goes to the concept of "bore" ... <br>  "And you still need it?" (C) a certain Rabinovich. <br><br>  3. Developing independent work skills ... <br>  This is the most difficult ... Here you can talk a lot and say nothing ... <br>  In short, if you are not a big boss (which is unlikely), then no one will write a dissertation to you ... So you have to invent, set, describe an experiment, poke around in literature, and do all this without the slightest glimpse of light at the end of the tunnel ... It‚Äôs very hard make it true, if there is a genuine interest to see what will be ‚Äúif this garbage, stir in that solution and set fire to ...‚Äù then it becomes much easier to work.  But still, there is not enough of this enthusiasm for a whole dissertation ... Especially when it‚Äôs necessary not only to ‚Äúsee how the bullshit stuff goes‚Äù, but also ‚Äúrecord, describe, analyze, draw conclusions, take into account all the comments, etc., etc.‚Äù P.  .... " <br>  In short, after these torments, you very clearly understand what real scientists are, and what are those whose "hair on their ears grows, with proseleny" (c) Strugatsky brothers ... <br><br>  4. Trips around the world, including abroad ... <br><br>  Strange as it may seem, but the most loyal in the whole world are attributed precisely to scientists ... The attitude is somewhat similar to the feelings caused by a certain subject inferior in nature.  That, probably, corresponds to the true state of things, for theoretically a real scientist is not from this world, but practically - the percentage of people with various physical and mental disabilities in science as in the industry is probably one of the highest ... <br><br>  So, let's start with the fact that, by invitations to seminars, conferences, work from universities and other scientific organizations from abroad, some embassies do not charge a visa fee (for example, Germany), and the vast majority of others take several times less.  Secondly, this visa is being opened to you with minimal time and other costs ... For example, the opposite situation is applying to a young man at the embassy for a visa to hitchhiking around the country of destination ... <br><br>  There are not so many variants of various conferences on your topic, but not just a lot, but a lot ... Wherever you want, and when you want, both in the Canaries, in Hawaii, and in other resort and not so places.  There would be a desire and opportunity.  The bourgeoisie generally have a widespread practice of combining the useful with the pleasant, and during conferences the atmosphere is the most friendly and inviting ... <br><br>  If you really plowed and picked up something worthy of attention, then your work will sooner or later be appreciated.  At the same conferences you will meet with a lot of people - not very useful and useful.  Contacts will be made with someone ... But this is more likely the rule for any professional environment - specialists in one area usually do not know each other in person, then they have an exact idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe existence of competitors ... <br><br>  And then - the world at your feet.  If you want to - work in an international team on a common problem, consulting by e-mail.  If you want to - look for options for internships from a month to three.  You can enroll in Western graduate school if there is no destiny. <br><br>  After defending options to travel and work, usually more, but here there are already other factors - family, child, old parents, etc. <br><br>  Well, if you take the extreme option - leaving our dreary Homeland to quite, then you can at least ‚Äúfind your way around‚Äù, where you like more and where you are in greater demand.  At least in a global sense ... <br>  Although from my own experience I can say, the more you learn about the realities of foreign life, the less desire there will be for a long time.  In the end, a loaf of bread and butter, and even maybe with caviar (as you are lucky) is not the most important thing in life ... </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/58906/">https://habr.com/ru/post/58906/</a></p>
