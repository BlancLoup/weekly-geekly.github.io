  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Microsoft Surface. A look into the future.</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  I think there is no such person who is not aware that <a href="http://microsoft.com/">Microsoft</a> <a href="http://www.habrahabr.ru/blog/lenta/13285.html">has released a</a> device called <strong><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/surface/">Surface</a></strong> .  Today I will dream up a little on the subject of areas and methods of its application. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  This new device has very interesting features, including: <br><ul><li>  Interactive multiuse (spun something! =)). </li><li>  The device is controlled in a way that is closest to the natural. </li><li>  Recognition of various devices, beautiful from a technical point of view, interaction with them. </li></ul><br>  We will not now pay attention to the price of this device (it bites quite significantly - 5-10 thousand evergreens), but let's see what creative potential for designers and developers have invested in <strong>Surface</strong> creators.  Let's try a little imagination and suggest possible extensions and applications for <strong>MS Surface</strong> : <br><br>  <strong>External modules</strong> .  Modules are some kind of external object that can interact with <strong>Surface</strong> , being located on its surface and recognized by the magic table (RFID, Wi-Fi?).  Hardware modules look like a small stylish device (glass parallelepiped?) That does not interfere with the work (and, perhaps, participating in it), being placed on the surface.  Conceptually, this is just an external program that has a physical shell and is understandable to most users ( <strong>Put &amp; Play</strong> ?).

      Pictorial tools.  Such a platform may well be a serious tool in the hands of a designer, artist, and also a draftsman, since from their point of view it seems to be a large tablet.  =) Well, everything is clear.  Moving on. <br><br>  Transition devices.  On the presentation rollers we saw how MS interacts with phones (the comparative characteristics of the two models were shown), cameras and other equipment.  But I think no one doubts that <strong>Surface</strong> will not be able to read information directly from an SD card or directly from a SIM.  I think, over time, various devices will be implemented to help in this difficult task.  I will not give examples of pairing, here everyone will be able to come up with a couple of dozen types of devices (the emphasis should be put on user convenience and natural interaction). <br><br>  Games.  There were always games, they always moved computer technologies forward and contributed to the wild pace of distribution of PC, Mac, PDA and other devices.  It is logical to assume that such a tasty device (from the point of view of management and innovation in general), like <strong>Surface</strong> , will not bypass our favorite pastime.  Games can be contained in memory cards, can be distributed as separate modules, and also let's not forget the Internet.  What fun we can see on <strong>MS Surface</strong> : <br><ul><li>  Educational game for children.  A colorful, safety toy is placed on the <strong>Surface</strong> , the game is loaded directly, in which several children and adults can take part.  At the end of the game, records are recorded in the built-in memory (about 64-128 Mb - that's enough forever, provided that there will only be records).  By the way, this is an example of <strong>Put &amp; Play</strong> (see above). </li><li>  Strategies a la diplomacy, etc. The main feature is a set of chips or game units (army figures, for example). </li><li>  Role-playing games a la Diablo, Titan Quest, etc. will look very interesting on Surface.  Management is quite convenient for a comfortable game. </li></ul><br>  The list goes on, <strong>Surface is</strong> great for different genres of games (well, except perhaps for card games! =)).  On this I finish my short list.  If anyone can offer any other ways to use <strong>Surface</strong> and possible add-ons to it, you are welcome in the comments!  =) <br><br>  Source: <a href="http://huze.ru/">huze.ru</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/10753/">https://habr.com/ru/post/10753/</a></p>
