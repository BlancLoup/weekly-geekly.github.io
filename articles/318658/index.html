There is a need for effective debugging of applications, and this, it turns out, is a whole art!  In this article, I provide my own list of tips that I hope will help you in debugging native code. <br><p></p><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d02/462/de8/d02462de8eb04dcbb1c875a656c7ba36.png"></div><p></p><br><br>  <i>The original article was written by Bartlomiej Filipek and published on his <a href="http://www.bfilipek.com/2016/06/11-debugging-tips-that-will-save-your.html">blog</a> .</i> <br><br><h2>  Auxiliary means </h2><br>  Each programmer must know how to start the debugger, set breakpoints, resume code execution, enter and exit functions (using the keyboard!).  Here are some simple tips to make debugging easier based on basic techniques. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h3>  1. Add error location information to the debugger report (LinePos) </h3><br>  Regardless of your skill level, you will probably still use one of the basic debugging methods: track certain values ‚Äã‚Äãusing functions and macros <i>printf</i> , <i>TRACE</i> , <i>outputDebugString</i> , etc.  and check the debugger report.  In Visual Studio, you can do one interesting trick that allows you to quickly move from the output window to a specific line of code. 
      <br>

          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      To do this, you just need to set the following output format: <br><br><pre><code class="cpp hljs"><span class="hljs-string"><span class="hljs-string">"%s(%d): %s"</span></span>, file, line, message</code> </pre> <br>  However, remember that the <i>file</i> and <i>line</i> values ‚Äã‚Äãmust be taken according to their actual position in the source file, and not in the recording function, so you probably need a macro like this: <br><pre> <code class="cpp hljs"><span class="hljs-meta"><span class="hljs-meta">#</span><span class="hljs-meta-keyword"><span class="hljs-meta"><span class="hljs-meta-keyword">define</span></span></span><span class="hljs-meta"> MY_TRACE(msg, ...) MyTrace(__LINE__, __FILE__, msg, __VA_ARGS__) </span><span class="hljs-comment"><span class="hljs-meta"><span class="hljs-comment">// usage: MY_TRACE("hello world %d", 5);</span></span></span></span></code> </pre> <br>  Note that <i>__LINE__</i> and <i>__FILE__</i> are standard ANSI-compatible predefined preprocessor macros that can be recognized by the compiler.  See <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/b0084kay.aspx">Predefined Macros, MSDN</a> . <br><br>  Also, do not forget to use the <i>OutputDebugString</i> function so that the message is displayed in the output window and not in the console. <br><br>  Now, when a message appears in the VS output window, you can double-click on it with the mouse to go to the specified file and line.  In the same way, you can work with warnings or error messages during compilation.  Once I received an error message, but I could not determine its exact location in the code, which is why I lost a lot of time.  That time I had to find a string, and this is a long and laborious process.  The described way to go to the code by double-clicking allows you to do this in a matter of milliseconds. <br><br>  By the way, if you have another IDE (not Visual Studio), is there such an opportunity in it?  Post in the comments, I would be interested to know. <br><br>  And here is a simple example of code where you can try the described technique: <a href="https://github.com/fenbf/articles/tree/master/DebuggingTipsSamples">github.com/fenbf/DebuggingTipsSamples</a> . <br><br>  <b>Update:</b> as indicated by <a href="http://www.bfilipek.com/2016/06/11-debugging-tips-that-will-save-your.html">jgalowicz</a> in his commentary, if you want the file names to be displayed in abbreviated form, make the macro <i>__SHORT_FILE__</i> : for details of implementation, see the <a href="http://blog.galowicz.de/2016/02/20/short_file_macro/">note in his blog</a> .  However, in Visual Studio <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/027c4t2s.aspx">, the / FC compiler option is</a> disabled by default, so usually abbreviated file names are usually displayed (referring only to the solution directory). <br><br><h3>  2. Get a simple static variable to control one option or another. </h3><br><pre> <code class="cpp hljs"><span class="hljs-comment"><span class="hljs-comment">// change while debugging if needed static bool bEnableMyNewFeature = true;</span></span></code> </pre> <br>  The <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bcew296c.aspx">Edit And Continue</a> function <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bcew296c.aspx">in Visual studio</a> is a very powerful tool, but you can get by with a simplified, ‚Äúmanual‚Äù version of it.  It is not so elegant, but it does its job.  You just need to have a static variable, with which you will manage this or that program option.  To do this, you can use the usual Boolean flag or an integer type variable.  During debugging, the value of this variable can be changed, which allows you to examine the operation of the option without restarting or rebuilding the program. <br><br>  How to change the value during debugging?  Go to the <i>watch window</i> for variables ( <i>Watch window</i> ) or just move the cursor over a variable - an edit box should appear in which you can set the desired value. <br><br>  And do not forget to <b>disable / remove</b> this terrible variable in the final assemblies and commits! <br><br><h3>  3. Conditional test points </h3><br>  I hope you already use conditional control points, but I still want to briefly tell you about the main ways of using them.  As the name implies, the work of the debugger at these points is suspended when a certain condition is met (quite simple). <br><p></p><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b2d/b24/451/b2db244519824d5d830472ae0419b6dd.png"></div><p></p><br>  One little piece of advice: write your own reference point if you need to examine the workings of a certain section of code in more detail. <br><br>  See the list of expressions used in the conditions: <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/za56x861.aspx">msdn: Expressions in the Debugger</a> <br><br>  But that is not all. <br><br>  As you must have noticed in the screenshot, there is another useful condition for the control point: ‚ÄúHit count‚Äù.  With it, you can set the number of events after which the control point will be activated.  This option is very useful when you need to track some kind of dynamic event or multiple objects. <br><br><h3>  4. Do not enter functions that you do not want to perform. </h3><br>  How many times have you been forced to enter a string-type constructor in order to quickly get out of it then?  Or in a lot of small / library functions, before you could get to the desired method?  In most cases, it is a waste of time. <br><br>  Take a look at this example: <br><br><pre> <code class="cpp hljs"><span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">void</span></span></span><span class="hljs-function"> </span><span class="hljs-title"><span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-title">MyFunc</span></span></span><span class="hljs-params"><span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-params">(</span></span><span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-params"><span class="hljs-keyword">const</span></span></span></span><span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-params"> </span></span><span class="hljs-built_in"><span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-params"><span class="hljs-built_in">string</span></span></span></span><span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-params"> &amp;one, </span></span><span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-params"><span class="hljs-keyword">const</span></span></span></span><span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-params"> </span></span><span class="hljs-built_in"><span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-params"><span class="hljs-built_in">string</span></span></span></span><span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-params"> &amp;two)</span></span></span><span class="hljs-function"> </span></span>{ <span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">auto</span></span> res = one + two; <span class="hljs-built_in"><span class="hljs-built_in">std</span></span>::<span class="hljs-built_in"><span class="hljs-built_in">cout</span></span> &lt;&lt; res &lt;&lt; <span class="hljs-string"><span class="hljs-string">"\n"</span></span>; } .... MyFunc(<span class="hljs-string"><span class="hljs-string">"Hello "</span></span>, <span class="hljs-string"><span class="hljs-string">"World"</span></span>);</code> </pre> <br>  And now try to enter the call of the <i>MyFunc ()</i> function by pressing <i>Ctrl + F11</i> .  Where does the debugger go?  This is what happens to me: <br><br><p></p><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/912/f90/0a3/912f900a33b9401991d313ed96ede4c7.png"></div><p></p><br>  Moreover, if you exit this constructor and re-enter it ... you will enter the constructor of the second parameter.  Now imagine what happens if there are several such parameters.  You'll lose your mind until you get to the desired method! <br><br>  As a rule, it is better to filter out such undesirable methods: it is unlikely that the problem lies in the constructor <i>std :: string</i> :) <br><br>  How to filter out these basic functions?  Starting from version 2012, in VS it is enough to edit the <i>default.natstepfilter</i> file. <br><br>  For ways to filter functions in earlier versions of VS, see here: <a href="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/andypennell/2004/02/06/how-to-not-step-into-functions-using-the-visual-c-debugger/">How to Not Step Into Functions using the Visual C ++ Debugger</a> .  There will have to tinker with the registry values. <br><br>  As an additional incentive, I‚Äôll let you know that Visual Assist has the same option and is much easier to work with.  In debug mode, the <a href="http://docs.wholetomato.com/default.asp%3FW506">VA Step Filter</a> window is displayed: just tick or uncheck the appropriate method from the list of found methods.  These settings can be applied both globally and locally for this project.  Filtering settings in VA are custom and cannot be added to the <i>default.natstepfilter</i> file. <br><br><h3>  5. Add auxiliary variables for objects in debug mode </h3><br>  The more data the better!  Unwanted messages can always be filtered, but you cannot get data from nothing.  Depending on the specific goals, it may be useful to create several auxiliary variables in the objects: when debugging, these variables can provide very valuable information or simply facilitate the work process. <br><br>  For example, when working with tree structures, you will probably often need to check the <i>pNext</i> and <i>pPrev elements</i> .  These pointers are usually placed in some kind of base class like <i>TreeNode</i> , and if you are interested in <i>MyTreeNode</i> , which is three levels lower in the class hierarchy, checking <i>pNext</i> every time can be quite tiresome.  And what if I update <i>MyTreeNode</i> , adding data from <i>pNext to it</i> ?  Then it will not be necessary to pass each time through all levels of the hierarchy to check this element.  The described method, however, has one drawback: you need to somehow fix this updated state.  The value of <i>pNext</i> can easily change, so you have to implement additional logic to synchronize these changes.  However, although this is true for most cases, a less elegant and effective solution will do for debugging tasks. <br><br>  I will give an example. <br><br>  I often have to work with tree structures representing text objects.  The text object contains strings, and strings contain characters.  It was very tiring to check every time what line I am at (i.e. what text it contains), because I had to return the first character of the line, and then watch the value on the <i>pNext</i> pointer to find out the second character and based on these two characters look what kind of string.  How to simplify this process?  I just started the <i>strLine</i> variable and added it to <i>Line</i> and periodically updated it.  Let it be an imperfect source of information (data is lost if a character is added or deleted for one frame, but in the next frame it still appears), but at least I can quickly find out which line I'm at the moment.  Just like that!  And you can save a lot of time. <br><br><h3>  6. Write your own debug visualizers </h3><br>  This is an extensive topic, which I will only briefly introduce here: <br><br>  If you do not like the way objects are displayed in the debugger, try writing your own visualizers. <br><br>  <a href="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/vcblog/2015/09/28/debug-visualizers-in-visual-c-2015/">Debug Visualizers in Visual C ++ 2015</a> <br><br>  In VS2015, a new built-in template has even appeared, which can be found in the <i>Project ‚Üí Add New Item ‚Üí Visual C ++ ‚Üí Utility ‚Üí Debugger visualization file (.natvis) file</i> . <br><br><h2>  Debugging tricks </h2><br>  Based on basic debugging techniques, you can build more complex ones. <br><br><h3>  7. Have to check a lot of objects? </h3><br>  If some code is called for a set of objects, it is very problematic to go through all these objects and check them line by line.  And what if you use the unique value of some field as a hint about where to look for the error?  To do this, you can create a conditional control point in which this value will be compared with a certain range.  The smaller this range, the better. <br><br>  Example: I often had to debug code that iterates through all the characters in a document.  There was a problem with one (special) symbol.  It‚Äôs impossible to debug all the characters individually, but I knew that this particular character was different from the rest of the bounding box, so I set a conditional control point at which the <i>width</i> value was checked, so I could access this symbol (condition <i>width&gt; usual_char_width</i> ).  Only two or three elements met this condition, so I quickly figured out the error. <br><br>  Generally speaking, the already such ranges, the better: do not have to check dozens or hundreds of places. <br><br><h3>  8. Mouse events </h3><br>  Debugging mouse events is especially difficult, because most of these events disappear when the debugger is stopped! <br><br>  Debugging mouse clicks is usually easy.  For example, if you need to check which code was called by clicking on an object, you just need to create a control point at the entrance to the <i>OnClick</i> / <i>onMouseDown</i> method. <br><br>  What about dragging objects?  When the debugger is stopped, the dragging state is lost.  In such situations, you can try the following tricks: <br><br><ul><li>  Use the good old <i>trace</i> / <i>printf</i> .  When dragging, a lot of messages are displayed that will help to understand what is happening without having to interrupt the execution of the code.  This method is suitable for short-term drag and drop operations, because otherwise the output will be too much data.  With this information, you can localize the problem and return to it later. <br><br></li><li>  Install conditional test points in places that require verification.  For example, when an object rotates, it can suddenly change its position, and you need to figure out why this happens.  To do this, you create control points at the entrance to the members responsible for the position of the object, which gives you the opportunity to study them.  When you stop the debugger, the spin state is lost, but before this happens, you can determine the potential location of the problem in the code.  Another way is to use the <i>obj_rot&gt; some_meaningful_value condition.</i> <br><br></li><li>  Dragging and dropping objects often occurs while copying them.  In this case, upon completion of the copying operation, the corresponding status is assigned to the original objects.  What if you set a checkpoint at which only original objects would be checked?  Or implement a special state that signals a <i>drag and drop operation</i> ?  In this case, the debugger will stop when this operation is completed. </li></ul><br><h3>  9. Create debug visualizers and other tools. </h3><br>  This tip assumes the further development of reception with the creation of simple auxiliary variables.  If you are working with complex objects, it‚Äôs good to have tools that can more effectively track data.  A basic set of similar tools can be found in Visual Studio and any other IDE or debugger, but since all projects are different, it‚Äôs better to develop your own solutions. <br><br>  This situation, I think, is typical for games.  You can, for example, create an additional interface layer and enable it during the game to see game statistics, performance information, and memory consumption.  The amount of information displayed is limited only by your needs.  So I strongly recommend taking the time to create such tools. <br><br><h2>  Other </h2><br><h3>  10. Debugging in Release Mode </h3><br>  Release builds are faster because almost all code optimizations are already included.  However, nothing prevents debugging in this case.  How exactly can this be implemented?  You need to do the following (for VS 2013 or VS 2015): <br><br><ul><li>  Set the <i>Debug Information Format</i> option to / Z7 (C7 compatibility format) or <i>/ Zi</i> (program database format). </li><li>  Set <i>Enable Incremental Linking</i> to ‚Äúno‚Äù </li><li>  Set the <i>Generate Debug</i> <i>Info</i> option to ‚Äúyes‚Äù </li><li>  Set the <i>References</i> option to <i>/ OPT: REF</i> , and <i>Enable COMDAT Folding</i> to <i>/ OPT: ICF</i> </li></ul><br><h3>  11. Accelerate the debug build! </h3><br><ul><li>  In case of a slow debugger, check the <i>Tools ‚Üí Options ‚Üí Debugging ‚Üí General ‚Üí ‚ÄúRequirements‚Äù option</i> .  I found out about her <a href="http://www.codeproject.com/Tips/515168/Overlooked-reason-for-debug-step-slow-down-in-Visu">here</a> . <br><br></li><li>  Disable a bunch of debugs ( <i>Debug Heap</i> ) - relevant for versions earlier than VS 2015. You can read about what it is in one of my previous articles: <a href="http://www.bfilipek.com/2015/09/visual-studio-slow-debugging-and.html">Visual Studio slow debugging and _NO_DEBUG_HEAP</a> .  Fortunately, in VS2015, the debug heap is disabled by default, so you should have no problems with this. <br><br></li><li>  Limit the loading of debug symbols files.  This technique allows you to reduce the number of loaded symbol files, which will speed up the launch of the program.  See here for details: <a href="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/visualstudioalm/2015/01/05/understanding-symbol-files-and-visual-studios-symbol-settings/">Understanding symbol files and Visual Studio's symbol settings</a> </li></ul><br><h2>  Conclusion </h2><br>  In this article, I brought 11 tips to help you speed up the process of debugging programs.  Which ones are most valuable?  Perhaps these are points about conditional control points, debugging of a multitude of objects and acceleration of the debug version.  However, the rest of the tips are important too, so I find it difficult to arrange them in any particular order.  In addition, depending on the specific tasks often have to give preference to different techniques. <br><br>  Moreover, this list is clearly not complete - there are many other techniques and practices.  Perhaps you also have something to add? <br><br><ul><li>  Do you use any special techniques when debugging applications? </li><li>  Do you use custom tools? </li></ul><br><h2>  Additional resources </h2><br><ul><li>  <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Debugging-Indispensable-Software-Hardware-Problems/dp/0814474578/ref%3Das_li_ss_tl%3Fie%3DUTF8%26amp%3Bqid%3D1465539807%26amp%3Bsr%3D8-1%26amp%3Bkeywords%3Ddebugging%26amp%3BlinkCode%3Dll1%26amp%3Btag%3Dbfilipek-20%26amp%3BlinkId%3D9a5cc0c4a9bcf6950e5c7e5e164d2f76">The Most Elusive Software and Hardware Problems</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Advanced-Windows-Debugging-Mario-Hewardt/dp/0321374460/ref%3Das_li_ss_tl%3Fie%3DUTF8%26amp%3Bqid%3D1465539807%26amp%3Bsr%3D8-5%26amp%3Bkeywords%3Ddebugging%26amp%3BlinkCode%3Dll1%26amp%3Btag%3Dbfilipek-20%26amp%3BlinkId%3Dcb8e1d0d70ce2bdef5f1d77e19698a3e">Advanced windows debugging</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Debug-Repair-Prevent-Pragmatic-Programmers/dp/193435628X/ref%3Das_li_ss_tl%3Fie%3DUTF8%26amp%3BdpID%3D31xF4DWc2mL%26amp%3BdpSrc%3Dsims%26amp%3BpreST%3D_AC_UL160_SR130%252C160_%26amp%3BrefRID%3D5W3Q9Q25K21BR6D1AM5J%26amp%3BlinkCode%3Dll1%26amp%3Btag%3Dbfilipek-20%26amp%3BlinkId%3D15db49b683f9d7619977cde3c6e6d7e4">Debug It !: Find, Repair, and Prevent Bugs in Your Code</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/5557y8b4.aspx">Using Breakpoints, MSDN</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/y740d9d3.aspx">Navigating through Code with the Debugger, MSDN</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/469416/More-Visual-Studio-Debugging-Tips-for-Native-De">10 More Visual Studio Debugging Tips for Native Development,</a> <a href="http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/469416/More-Visual-Studio-Debugging-Tips-for-Native-De"><br></a>  <a href="http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/469416/More-Visual-Studio-Debugging-Tips-for-Native-De">Marius Bancila, CodeProject</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://docs.wholetomato.com/default.asp%3FW506">VA Step Filter, Visual Assist</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/vcblog/2013/03/07/guest-post-the-expression-evaluator/">VC Team Blog: The Expression Evaluator</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/visualstudioalm/archive/2015/03/03/make-debugging-faster-with-visual-studio.aspx">VC Team Blog: Make Debugging Faster with Visual Studio</a> </li></ul></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/318658/">https://habr.com/ru/post/318658/</a></p>
