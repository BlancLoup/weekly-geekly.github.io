However, I have noticed in similar articles a sufficiently large number of facts that do not completely or completely coincide with reality, but these were still trifles, in general, the pictures are not distorting.  Here one of the paragraphs turned out just a masterpiece. <br><br></h5>  I will quote it in full: <br>  <i>‚Äú... Or, let's say, you pay for your purchase through a certain online store, continues Sergey Shivalin, marketing director at Adscore.ru, who has been studying the cybercrime market for many years.</i>  <i>‚ÄúThe average hand online store is hundreds of thousands of cards.</i>  <i>If there is someone dishonest, it will be technically not very difficult for him to get the card number and expiration date, ‚Äùhe says.</i>  <i>In addition, Shivalin notes, most of the sites are thoughtlessly, a good half of them have minimal vulnerabilities: you can download some malicious software on these sites that will allow attackers to retrieve plastic card data ... ‚Äù</i>

      For those who did not follow the link, I remind you that, generally speaking, this article is written about fraud through telecom operators, and online stores have little to do with the voiced topic.  However, this is exactly the case of the author.  The trouble is different: <br><br>  <b>First:</b> ‚ÄúThe average hand online store is hundreds of thousands of cards.‚Äù  This phrase at first strained.  Then forced to reach for the calculator.  So: <a name="habracut"></a><br>  - hundreds of thousands of cards is a six-digit number; we take an average of 500,000; <br>  - the card is issued for a period in the vast majority from 1 to 3 years, we take 2 years; <br>  - i.e.  ‚ÄúMedium Hand IM‚Äù per year receives 250,000 transactions on existing cards, or approximately 700 transactions per day; <br>  - The number of payments using bank cards is now for various sources an average of 11% of the total mass of orders.  Those.  it turns out that the ‚Äúmedium hand‚Äù store performs <b>700/11 * 100 = 6,500 orders</b> per day! <br><br>  I want to upset the respected Sergey Shivalin, such shops are not only mediocre, but in general, in principle, as a class.  in Russia there is no. <br><br>  Perhaps, there were sales sites in mind, for example, air tickets, there really are such volumes there, but those cannot be attributed to online stores. <br><br>  <b>Secondly:</b> and, perhaps, in the main.  No online store, let it be written on the knee of a smoking student, and really has a lot of holes for the introduction of malicious software does not receive any from the client!  bank card data.  When a client chooses such a method of payment, the IM sends, in simple words, it to the processing company‚Äôs site, transferring there only a large number of the order and the amount to be debited from the client.  ALL data from the card is entered by the user on secure processing sites verified by banks, which in turn have received the approval of international payment systems.  And if suddenly there is a malicious code on the website of the online store, the above sites created by no means children will be at war with it. <br><br>  Again, it is possible that viruses were meant that allow you to read information entered from the keyboard, but again - online stores here stand a little on their side, because  You can get such a ‚Äúgift‚Äù on any website, and no one has canceled the general rules of hygiene on the Web. <br><br>  <b>What it is all about: such horror stories are still the lot of the press, the colors of autumn foliage, and not serious publications, to which MONEY, I think, consider themselves to be.</b>  <b>And such texts obviously do not contribute to the improvement of the literacy of the population, but they do exactly the opposite.</b>  <b>Everything is not so bad in this area in fact.</b> <habracut></habracut></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/108179/">https://habr.com/ru/post/108179/</a></p>
