  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Move anyone to Exhaust</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><h6>  karma does not allow writing anywhere else, sorry </h6><br><br>  Once Vladimir Vladimirovich ™ Putin walked along the long Kremlin corridors.  It was piercingly quiet. <br>  - Where is everyone?  - Vladimir Vladimirovich ™ muttered perplexedly, - Why is no one preparing for putting ... ugh, for rallies? <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Vladimir Vladimirovich ™ approached one of the doors, opened it slightly and looked into the office.  In an office at the computer some official sat. <br>  - Ow!  - Vladimir Vladimirovich ™ said loudly, - Bratello! <br>  The official raised his foggy eyes on Vladimir Vladimirovich ™ and said detachedly: <br>  “Here is a girl ... we have not seen her for twenty years ... and now I am in the Kremlin, and she is in Bobruisk, fat and ugly ...” <br>  And the official again buried in the screen. <br>  Vladimir Vladimirovich ™ shrugged his shoulders and closed the office door, then walked over to the next one and looked into the office again. <br>  In an office at the computer some official sat. <br>  - Bratello!  - Vladimir Vladimirovich called ™, - Ways ... ugh, meeting! <br>  The official, without looking up from the screen, said to Vladimir Vladimirovich ™ as follows: <br>  - Seryoga and Vovchik ... my sidekick, earthlings ... for a beer, for beer, we should ... remember everything ... <br>  Vladimir Vladimirovich ™ got a little worried.  He began to walk down the hall and look into all the offices.  In all the offices, some officials sat at the computers and muttered: <br>  - Che is Mishkin's car?  Yes, it can not be ... Maybach?!? <br>  - Tonya, can we meet again?  Have dinner together?  I know where I work now? <br>  - Hedgehog you mother!  Well this is my neighbor!  Well, it is necessary, as she twisted! <br>  - In the sense - my baby?  Is this my baby?  You persecute! <br>  - Mom, may I come to the New Year, come ... <br>  - Where are you now?  In Wimbildan?  Listen, do you have work there?  And then you never know what will happen here after all these elections ... <br>  - Vera Mikhailovna, all these years after school I wanted to tell you what kind of a sad person you are ... <br>  Vladimir Vladimirovich ™ became scary.  He took a government mobile phone with a golden double-headed coat of arms instead of a keyboard from the pocket of his presidential suit and pressed the single button to call the deputy head of his Administration, Vladislav Yuryevich Surkov. <br>  - Hey, bratello!  - Vladimir Vladimirovich ™ said excitedly, - Why is this happening in the Kremlin?  Everyone is sitting at the computers and talking to them!  Some neighbors they have there, school teachers, chum ... <br>  “Classmates,” answered Vladislav Yuryevich. <br>  - Classmates!  - Vladimir Vladimirovich ™ nodded, - And classmates! <br>  “Yes, no,” said Vladislav Yuryevich, “Classmates are the name.”  This site is on the Internet, where everyone writes, what school they studied, who they know, who they slept with, from whom children and all that. <br>  “I don't understand,” muttered Vladimir Vladimirovich ™, “What does it mean - everything?” <br>  “Everything,” said Vladislav Yuryevich, “You, for example, where did you go to school?” <br>  “At two hundred and eighty-one,” said Vladimir Vladimirovich ™. <br>  “So ...” muttered Vladislav Yuryevich and Vladimir Vladimirovich ™ heard the click of a keyboard, “St. Petersburg, two hundred and eighty-first ... in which year did you finish?” <br>  - In the seventieth, - Vladimir Vladimirovich ™ did not understand anything. <br>  - Here, the seventieth year of release, - Vladislav Yuryevich said rather, - Well, for example, your classmates.  Reuben Braude - remember that? <br>  - Reuben ... - Vladimir Vladimirovich ™ whispered, - Listen, but what is this - everyone can find out everything about my classmates?  But what about the secrecy mode? <br>  “You did not understand,” Vladislav Yuryevich explained. “This is exactly for the secrecy regime and this site was brought.  This is a special project of the FSB.  Genious idea!  All citizens of Russia voluntarily disclose all their connections.  Savings on operational work is enormous. <br>  “Wow,” muttered Vladimir Vladimirovich ™, “What, are they all talking about themselves?” <br>  - And with photos!  - confirmed Vladislav Yurevich, - The whole country is in full view. <br>  “Well, wow,” Vladimir Vladimirovich ™ respectfully shook his head, “And before that, everyone needed an investigator ... a lamp in his face and: who do you work for?” <br>  “And now nothing is needed,” said Vladislav Yuryevich, “Twenty-first century in the courtyard!” <br>  Vladimir Vladimirovich ™ smiled dreamily. <br><br>  via <a href="http://vladimir.vladimirovich.ru/2007-11-14/">vladimir.vladimirovich.ru</a> </div>
