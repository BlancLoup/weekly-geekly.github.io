These are the characters of the episode "Don't Blink" - the tenth episode of the third season (2007) and one of the best episodes in the history of "Doctor Who". <br><br>  From the perspective of an outside observer, the angels look like stone statues, whose eyes are often covered with their palms.  But if you blink, looking at Angel, you will immediately notice an elusive change in the position of the statue - it seems to have become closer.  And God forbid, a long look away. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/3c3/9e4/092/3c39e40928684feca87513185d1b8f96.jpg">

      If you look away, the crying angel comes close.  The fact is that these aliens move only when no one is looking at them, even if they just blink.  In a sense, they resemble the character of the Greek myths Gorgon Medusa, which forced to petrify anyone who looks at her.  Only here does this principle work the other way around. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/2bd/725/12e/2bd72512e33c41fb9e53683a6974a21b.jpg"><br>  <font color="gray">Gorgon Medusa, one of the three Gorgon sisters (picture of Caravaggio).</font>  <font color="gray">According to legend, it was a girl with beautiful hair, but the god Poseidon captured her in the temple of Athena, where an innocent beauty tried to hide from the pursuit of god.</font>  <font color="gray">In retaliation for the blasphemy in her temple, Athena turned her hair into hydra</font> <br><br>  Greek mythology and modern science fiction are surprisingly combined in the depths of secret laboratories of the CIA and MI5, where software is developed for the needs of foreign intelligence.  <a href="https://geektimes.ru/post/286768/">The CIA programmers adoring modern pop culture</a> , of course, watched Doctor Who, and that series with Weeping Angels.  That is why they gave such a name to a tab for Samsung TVs.  TVs that watch the audience - these are such small Weeping Angels, crying angels, just try to blink or blurt out too much. <br><br>  On March 7, 2017, the Wikileaks website began publishing the Vault collection of 7 secret documents from the Central Intelligence Agency.  <a href="https://geektimes.ru/post/286702/">The first part of the Year Zero collection contains 8761 files</a> , including a list of various malware, viruses, Trojans, dozens of 0day exploits and payloads for them, remote control systems and relevant documentation. <br><br>  In the published compilation there was documentation on the <a href="https://wikileaks.org/ciav7p1/cms/space_753667.html">Weeping Angel tab</a> for Samsung TVs with built-in microphones and voice recognition (voice control) enabled.  This malware was created by the CIA‚Äôs Embedded Development Branch (EDB) development unit in conjunction with the British intelligence agency MI5 / BTSS.  The program adds to the TV mode 'Fake-Off', when the TV looks off, but at the same time records conversations in the room and sends them to the CIA web server. <br><br>  On April 21, 2017, Wikileaks <a href="https://wikileaks.org/vault7/">published a</a> new information on the Weeping Angel tab - a detailed <a href="https://wikileaks.org/vault7/document/EXTENDING_User_Guide/">user guide for CIA agents</a> .  The document is dated February 28, 2014 ( <a href="https://wikileaks.org/vault7/document/EXTENDING_User_Guide/EXTENDING_User_Guide.pdf">pdf</a> ).  In technical documentation, the tool is called EXTENDING.  According to Wikileaks, this is the original version of the bookmark, created in British intelligence MI5 / BTSS and improved by the CIA.  Colleagues from the United Kingdom and the United States coordinated their work on this tool and shared their experience, organizing Joint Development Workshops ‚Äî joint development workshops. <br><br>  Three dozen pages of the user's manual set out the following: <br><br><ul><li>  key features bookmark EXTENDING; </li><li>  malware configuration: the package includes an Ubuntu 12.10 ISO image to create a Linux virtual machine, where encrypted files are generated with settings (the Oracle VM Virtual Box installer allows you to set the environment for running this Ubuntu VM virtual machine) - the configuration should be generated only protected computer disconnected from the Internet;  there is also a wlan.bat script for configuring the Hosted Network Virtual Adapter virtual adapter on a laptop; </li><li>  installation process; </li><li>  compatibility with Samsung TVs; </li><li>  installation process of a web server for receiving information from a TV set - the web server is installed using the Windows installer XAMPP, there is also the Android web server PAW Server, the bundle includes the .apk file and the configured folder PAW2; <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c41/c83/a5e/c41c83a5e0e146d29364847f244f2150.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/4ff/0b0/0f4/4ff0b00f427a42648498345448f7d31d.png"><br><br></li><li>  processing audio data recorded via the built-in microphone using the Windows program ECDLive.exe; </li><li>  the procedure for removing a bookmark from the TV (in the initial configuration, the ‚Äúdate of death‚Äù of the bookmark is set); </li><li>  testing and possible operational problems; </li><li>  known problems and bookmarking limitations; </li><li>  decoding error codes (Appendix A). </li></ul><br>  The document states that the program is designed for Samsung F Series models (firmware 1111, 1112 and 1116), and the preliminary configuration of the malware is carried out on a personal computer under Linux.  Installation on the TV by using a USB-flash drive.  The program can work in three modes: 1) permanent audio recording;  2) audio only in TV off mode;  3) audio recording only in the mode of the included TV. <br><br>  As can be seen from the documentation, the recorded audio files from the TV are not transmitted via the Internet, but via WiFi - to a laptop or Android smartphone located nearby.  Already it can be connected to the Internet, through it you can get an archive of recorded files or wiretap in real time.  Probably, this tab is best suited for installation on "public" TVs, which are located in office buildings, hotel lobbies, cafeterias, hairdressers, etc. <br><br>  The malware files from the Vault 7 archive promise to publish after checking and closing vulnerabilities on the part of manufacturers. <br><br>  PS Now the CIA and the FBI are conducting a <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/news/cia-fbi-on-manhunt-for-leaker-who-gave-top-secret-documents-to-wikileaks/">joint investigation</a> to identify the officer involved in the leak of documents.  It is surprising that for 1.5 months it was not possible to calculate it. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/403437/">https://habr.com/ru/post/403437/</a></p>
