  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Pavel Durov presented Telegraph publishing service</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/dc2/199/112/dc2199112ddd0d8968338d30cf264840.png"><br>  The founder of the social network "Vkontakte" and the Telegram messenger Pavel Durov, together with his team, presented the new publishing service <a href="http://telegra.ph/">Telegraph</a> .  The resource is radically different from other platforms for its minimalism and anonymity. <br><br>  ‚ÄúToday we are launching Telegraph - a publishing tool that allows you to create publications, reviews, insert photos and all types of embedded-code.  Also ‚Äútelegraphic‚Äù posts will look great as Telegram messages, ‚Äùthe <a href="https://telegram.org/blog/instant-view">official messenger</a> says. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Telegraph with confidence can be called a minimalist hybrid of the messenger and the platform, for example, <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medium">Medium</a> .  With a more detailed examination, in addition to the foregoing, we can notice a concept that is no longer the first ten years, namely, anonymous imageboard. <br><br>  In the new resource Durov minimalism was raised to the absolute and everything superfluous, according to the creators, thrown overboard.  The Telegraph, in contrast to even the very impersonal Telegram, does not have a registration, by analogy with the imageboards mentioned.  As it turned out, almost all UI-elements of ordinary platforms were considered redundant.  Navigation, profile, post feed preview modes, static publishing layout panel, comments on posts - in the Telegraph there is no such thing.  There are only three fields: "title", "author", "publication text" (with pop-up basic formatting buttons), followed by obtaining a unique link to the text.

        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>

      <br>
      The Telegram team led by Durov did not in the least deceive the audience, stating that the Telegraph is a publishing tool.  It has exactly and what is important, only what is needed to create a standard publication, review or article.  The only drawback is the fact that if you do not store cookies or links to pages, then after closing the Telegraph window your post will go into oblivion. <br><br>  In fact, Durov and the team created a platform whose concept has long been in the air: instead of competing with existing social networks and platforms, in an attempt to form their own audience core, they suggest parasitizing on the infrastructure already created.  Instead of the standard sites and blogospheres, we are offered only a digestible tool for writing texts of any size and format, without unnecessary ‚Äúwhistles‚Äù, buttons, profiles and advertising. <br><br>  A serious disadvantage of the project is one of its features, issued as a plus - anonymity.  In times of fake news and publications for ‚Äúfiring up‚Äù disputes and clashes on the net, the ability to subscribe to whatever name you like is potentially dangerous.  It is likely that this is why it was decided to abandon the tape of publications (and as a result of navigation, moderation and other content filters).  In fact, all these functions are transferred to the already existing ecosystems of social networks and communities, where verified user accounts will act as guarantors of authorship if they wish to fix their authorship.  Thus, the person who first provided a link to a publication in the Telegraph automatically conditionally becomes the author of the text, which is not without meaning. <br><br>  Whether Telegraph will find its audience will show time.  For the time being, he bribes with his simplicity an online editor with the possibility of obtaining a link to the text for further repost in the ‚Äúrest‚Äù of the Internet.  Its applicability to popular Telegram-channels with news, Telegram-bloggers and Twitter users, who previously had to publish in VK or FB in order to convey their thoughts in a certain format to the audience, is already visible. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/399347/">https://habr.com/ru/post/399347/</a></p>
