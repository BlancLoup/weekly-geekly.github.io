  <section class="page js-page"><h1>React and Code Splitting</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><p>  I got acquainted with code splitting a long time ago, in the year since 2008, when Yandex hung up a bit, and Yandex.Direct scripts synchronously connected on the site, just this site was killed.  In general, in those days it was the norm, if your ‚Äúscripts‚Äù are 10 files that you connect in the only correct order, which still works (with defer) just to cheer. <br>  Then I began to work actively with maps, and they still connect as external scripts, of course, lazy-load.  Later, as a member of the Yandex.Maps team, I actively used <a href="https://github.com/ymaps/modules">ymodules</a> on tree-shaking on the client, which provided just the perfect code splitting. </p><br><p> And then I went over to the <code>webpack</code> and <code>React</code> , to the country of unafraid idiots who looked at <code>require.ensure</code> as a ram at a new gate, and they still do so. </p><br><p>  Code splitting is not a "wow feature", it is a "mast hev".  Still <code>SSR</code> did not interfere ... </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/47/7y/ay/477yayld6xtgc06hmgfejbrfpxc.jpeg"></p><a name="habracut"></a><br><h3 id="malenkoe-vvedenie">  Small introduction </h3><br><p>  Nowadays, when bandles are getting stout every day, code splitting becomes more important than ever.  At the very beginning, people came out of this situation simply by creating separate entry points for each page of their application, which is generally good, but it will not work for the SPA. <br>  Then there was the <code>require.ensure</code> function, today known as <code>dynamic import</code> (simply import), through which you can simply request a module that you will later receive and receive. </p><br><p>  The first library "about this case" for React was <a href="https://github.com/jamiebuilds/react-loadable">react-loadable</a> , the hyip around which I still do not really understand, and which has already died (just ceased to like the author). </p><br><p>  Now, the less ‚Äúofficial‚Äù choice will be <code>React.lazy</code> and <a href="https://github.com/smooth-code/loadable-components/">loadable-components</a> (just <code>@loadable</code> ), and the choice between them is obvious: </p><br><ul><li>  React.lazy absolutely can not SSR (Server Side Rendering), from the word at all.  Even in the tests, it will fall without any special tambourine dances, such as "synchronous promises". </li><li>  Loadable SSR can, and at the same time supports Suspense, those are no worse than React.Lazy. </li></ul><br><p>  Including loadable, it supports beautiful wrappers over loading libraries (loadable.lib, you can take the moment.js to React renderProp), and helps webpack on the server side to collect a list of used scripts, styles and resources for a prefetch (which webpack is not very good at).  In general, read the <a href="https://www.smooth-code.com/open-source/loadable-components/docs/loadable-vs-react-lazy/">official documentation</a> . </p><br><h3 id="ssr">  SSR </h3><br><p>  In general - all the problem in the SSR.  For CSR (Client Side Render), either React.lazy or a small script of 10 lines will fit - this will definitely be enough, and it does not make sense to include a large external library.  But on the server this will not be enough.  And if you don‚Äôt need an SSR, you can stop reading.  You have no problems that need to be solved long and hard. </p><br><p>  SSR is a pain.  I am (in some way) one of the loadable-components mintainers and it‚Äôs just terrible how many bugs come out of different places.  And with each update webpack arrives even more. </p><br><h3 id="ssr--css">  SSR + CSS </h3><br><p>  An even bigger source of problems with SSR is CSS. <br>  If your Styled-components is not so painful, they come with <code>transform-stream</code> which itself will add to the final code what you need.  The main thing is that there should be one version of SC everywhere, otherwise the focus will not work - one version of SC will not be able to tell anything about itself the other, and SC likes to be fruitful (check your bundle).  I will be honest - it is because of this restriction that the focus usually <strong>does not</strong> work. </p><br><p>  C emotion is simpler - their <code>styled</code> adapter just spits out the <code>&lt;style&gt;</code> in front of the component itself, and the problem is solved.  Simple, cheap and cheerful.  In principle, very mobile-friendly, and greatly optimizes the very first-view.  But a little spoils the second.  And for me personally, conscience does not allow inline styles. </p><br><p>  With regular CSS (including various magic obtained from CSS-in-JS libraries) is still easier - information about them is in the webpack column, and which CSS is known to be included. </p><br><h3 id="poryadok-podklyucheniya">  Connection procedure </h3><br><p>  This is where the dog dug.  When should I connect? <br>  The point of SSR-friendly code splitting is that before calling <code>ReactDOM.hydrate</code> you need to download all the "components" that are already in the server response, but not the strength of the scripts downloaded to the client at the moment. </p><br><p>  Therefore, all libraries offer a callback that will be called when all-all-all that needs to be loaded, and you can start the <em>brains</em> .  This is the meaning of the work of the SSR codesplitting libraries. </p><br><p>  JS can be downloaded at any time, and usually the list is added to the end of HTML, but the CSS, so that there is no FOUC, must be added to the beginning. <br>  All libraries can do this for the old <code>renderToString</code> , and all libraries <strong>can</strong> not do this for <code>renderToNodeStream</code> . <br>  It does not matter if you only have JS (this does not happen), or SC / Emotion (which will add themselves).  But - if you have "just CSS" - everything.  Either they will be at the end, or you will have to use <code>renderToString</code> , or other buffering, which will provide a time delay for the TTFB (Time To First Byte) and decrease the meaning of this SSR altogether. </p><br><p>  And of course - all this is tied to the webpack and nothing else.  Therefore, with all due respect to Greg, the author of loadable-components - I propose to consider other options. </p><br><blockquote>  Next comes the three-part agenda, the main idea of ‚Äã‚Äãwhich is to do something that is not killed and not dependent on the bandler. </blockquote><br><h3 id="1-react-imported-component">  1. React-Imported-Component </h3><br><p>  <a href="https://github.com/theKashey/react-imported-component">React-Imported-Component</a> is not a bad "loader", with a more or less standardized interface, very similar to loadable-components, which can SSR for anything that moves. </p><br><p>  The idea is very simple. </p><br><ul><li>  source codes are scanned, all <code>import</code> s are found and <strong>copied</strong> into a separate file </li><li>  using the <code>babel plugin</code> each call to <code>import</code> turns into some sugar <br><pre> <code class="plaintext hljs">const AsyncComponent1 = imported(() =&gt; import('./MyComponent')); ///// const AsyncComponent1 = imported(() =&gt; importedWrapper("imported_18g2v0c_component", import('./MyComponent')));</code> </pre> </li><li>  When you call "import", function.toString is simply done and the magic number is pulled out.  Thus, it becomes clear what was caused.  (Yes - it imposes some restrictions on the code, but less than other loaders, which generally can not "not" import) </li><li>  on the client we have a file where all possible imports are collected, and any import can be <em>repeated</em> . </li></ul><br><p>  No need to <code>stats.json</code> , adapt to optimize webpack (concatenation, or common code) - you just need to match the "label" of one import in the key in the array and perform the import again.  How it will be executed within the framework of a specific bandler, how many files will actually be uploaded and from where it is not his problem. </p><br><p>  Minus - the start of loading "used" chunks occurs after loading the main bundle that stores the mapping, which is a little "later" than in the case of loadable-components, which will add this information directly to HTML. </p><br><p>  Yes, with CCS it does not work from the word in any way. </p><br><h3 id="2-used-styles">  2. used-styles </h3><br><p>  But <a href="https://github.com/theKashey/used-styles">used-styles</a> only works with CSS, but just like react-imported-components. </p><br><ul><li>  scans all css (in the build directory) </li><li>  remembers where which class is defined </li><li>  scans the output renderToNodeStream (or the response <code>renderToString</code> ) </li><li>  finds class = 'XXX', matches the file and spits it out at the server response. </li><li>  (well, then teleports all such styles to the head, so as not to break the hydrate).  Style Components work just as well. </li></ul><br><p>  There are no TTBT delays, there is no tethered to the bundler - a fairy tale.  Works as a watch, if the styles are normally written. </p><br><p>  Example of the work <a href="">react-import-component + used-styles + parcel</a> . </p><br><blockquote>  Not the most obvious bonus - on the server both libraries will do "everything they need" during a startup, until the express server can accept the first client, and will be completely synchronized and just on the server, and during the tests. </blockquote><br><h3 id="3-react-prerendered-component">  3. react-prerendered-component </h3><br><p>  And the library closes the top three, which makes <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2019/02/rendering-on-the-web">"partial rehydration"</a> , and does it in such a grandfather way that I amaze myself.  She really adds "divas." </p><br><ul><li>  on server: <br><ul><li>  wraps a piece of wood in a div with a "famous id" </li></ul></li><li>  on the client: <br><ul><li>  component constructor finds "your" div </li><li>  copies its innerHTML, before "React" chews it over. </li><li>  uses this HTML until the client is ready to <code>hydrate</code> </li><li>  technically it allows the use of a Hybrid SSR (Rendertron) </li></ul></li></ul><br><pre> <code class="plaintext hljs">const AsyncLoadedComponent = loadable(() =&gt; import('./deferredComponent')); const AsyncLoadedComponent = imported(() =&gt; import('./deferredComponent')); &lt;PrerenderedComponent live={AsyncLoadedComponent.preload()} // when Promise got resolve - component will go "live" &gt; &lt;AsyncLoadedComponent /&gt; // meanwhile you will see "preexisting" content &lt;/PrerenderedComponent&gt;</code> </pre> <br><p>  With loadable-components, this focus does not work, since it <a href="https://github.com/smooth-code/loadable-components/pull/226">does not return from the preload promise</a> .  This is especially important for <a href="https://github.com/stereobooster/react-snap">react-snap</a> (and other "prerenders") libraries that have "content", but have not gone through the "real" SSR. </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/av/oa/uy/avoauymgvrxzwyo18-8skc69cws.png"></p><br><p>  From the point of view of the code, it is 10 lines, plus a little more to get a <a href="https://github.com/thearnica/react-uid">stable SSR-CSR UID</a> , taking into account the random load order and code execution. </p><br><p>  Bonuses: </p><br><ul><li>  you can not wait for the "download all the script" before the start of the <em>brain</em> - the brain will run as soon as it is ready </li><li>  it <strong>is</strong> possible not to load brains <strong>at all</strong> , and leaving the SSR-ed data (if there is no SSR version, then the brains will still be loaded).  Just like in the times of jQuery. </li><li>  You can still stream <strong>caching</strong> large render blocks to implement (theoretically Suspence-compatible) - again by means of transform stream. </li><li>  and serialize / deserialize the state to / from HTML, like during jQuery </li></ul><br><p>  In principle, serialization and deserialization were the main idea of ‚Äã‚Äãcreating a library to solve the problem of state duplication (picture from an article about SSR).  Caching arrived later. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/wb/9q/ni/wb9qniykqfav6ouzmjkrtpjhy5w.png"></p><br><h3 id="itogo">  Total </h3><br><p>  Total - three approaches that can change your view on SSR and code splitting.  The first works with JS codesplitting, and does not break.  The second works with CSS codesplitting, and does not break.  The third works at the HTML level, simplifying and speeding up some processes, and again, does not break. </p><br><p>  Links to libraries: </p><br><ul><li>  <a href="https://github.com/theKashey/react-imported-component/">https://github.com/theKashey/react-imported-component/</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://github.com/theKashey/react-prerendered-component">https://github.com/theKashey/react-prerendered-component</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://github.com/theKashey/used-styles">https://github.com/theKashey/used-styles</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://github.com/smooth-code/loadable-components/">https://github.com/smooth-code/loadable-components/</a> </li><li>  (for those who are in the tank) <a href="https://reactjs.org/blog/2018/10/23/react-v-16-6.html">https://reactjs.org/blog/2018/10/23/react-v-16-6.html#reactlazy-code-splitting-with-suspense</a> </li></ul><br><p>  Articles (in English) </p><br><ul><li>  (about imported) <a href="https://hackernoon.com/react-and-code-splitting-made-easy-f118befb5168">https://hackernoon.com/react-and-code-splitting-made-easy-f118befb5168</a> </li><li>  (about prerendered) <a href="https://medium.com/%40antonkorzunov/react-server-side-code-splitting-made-again-a61f8cbbd64b">https://medium.com/@antonkorzunov/react-server-side-code-splitting-made-again-a61f8cbbd64b</a> </li><li>  (about SSR) <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2019/02/rendering-on-the-web">https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2019/02/rendering-on-the-web#partial-rehydration</a> </li></ul></div>
