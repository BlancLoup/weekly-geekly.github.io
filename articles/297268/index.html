Bern, the author of the best-selling book ‚ÄúPeople Who Play Games,‚Äù said that some people subconsciously aspire to the so-called ‚Äúdriven-away housewife‚Äù syndrome, in which permanent employment helps a person to feel his own worth.</i>  <i>If you realize that a measured schedule or complete inaction makes you less useful, then you can not read this text.</i> <br><br> <a href="http://universarium.org/course/452"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/1c5/a13/202/1c5a1320266e4b82a34c9ae31e0c858e.jpg"></a> <br><br>  Those who read these lines, of course, understand that employment efficiency.  And, importantly, your 100% workload does not guarantee the achievement of goals.  Rather, on the contrary, if you are busy all the time, then you even have no time to think about what (and whose actually) goals you are achieving. <blockquote>  ‚ÄúIt is at this moment that the understanding comes that‚Äú Time Management ‚Äùrefers not so much to work issues, as to the activity as a whole.  That is, it concerns not cases, but a person ‚Äù- the author of the‚Äú <a href="http://universarium.org/course/452">Time Management</a> ‚Äùcourse, Anton Krasnobabtsev. </blockquote><br>  How to spend less time and get the same, and maybe more results? <br><a name="habracut"></a><br> <a href="http://universarium.org/course/452"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e5d/ba2/e0b/e5dba2e0b491467fb1762822242ce217.jpg"></a>

      <b>How employment appears</b> <br>  To begin with, let's see what brings us to the situation when we are busy 24 hours a day and this is not enough for us.  Frankly, this situation has only three reasons: <br><ul><li>  all affairs are done at the last moment; </li><li>  Of all the cases available to carry out, always first take on the shortest and simplest; </li><li>  Do not spend efforts on job optimization and skill development. </li></ul><br>  It is very important to develop awareness and self-discipline so that the person fixes for himself the moment of the emergence of a new business, stops in the bustle and asks himself a simple question: ‚ÄúWhat do I want to achieve in this business?‚Äù.  Introducing time management practices into your life is a long and difficult work on yourself, but the results justify the effort! <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/YEvZUm5Mhcs%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=25657,15700022,15700186,15700191,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhi4_fO8LfRLSOvdsn-LhrZSIVqhkg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  <b>Hello pareto</b> <br>  We know that all things are extremely important.  But, believe me, from the entire list of a busy day, only 20% of efforts bring 80% of the result.  The principle is universal.  For example, if you work with clients, then you notice that among them there is a certain 20% that brings 80% of the company's total profits.  It remains only to find them and give them due attention.  In order to make it easier to figure out which of the cases / clients / employees bring the most significant results, we will give a hint: <br><ul><li>  sort of cases that help us create the right work system.  The organization of systematic work gives a huge return. </li><li>  tasks related to the prevention of difficulties encountered.  Many of the activities of life can be prevented, that is, they can not do at all, if they provide. </li></ul><br>  These things can be called more important. <br><br>  <b>Priorities</b> <br>  What do important and unimportant matters mean?  Often, people who begin to distribute their time correctly, come to a standstill: it seems to them that all things are the most important, all lead to a meaningful result.  In fact, it is not.  This is not a very realistic approach.  It is clear that all our affairs have a result, but it is important for us to single out those things that really bring 80% of the results.  In order to verify this, look at the past day?  What of all that you have done is the most effective?  It is worth asking yourself the question ‚ÄúHow will this help me in achieving my main goals?‚Äù If the answer is ‚Äúnot much help‚Äù, then you can afford to put it off with a clear conscience or sometimes even give up the job altogether, if you look at it and understand that you cannot do everything physically, you need to sacrifice something, and it‚Äôs better than this than important things. <br><br> <a href="http://universarium.org/course/452"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/117/7fb/dee/1177fbdee3dc4d9682cab95c5fca80ac.jpg"></a> <br><br>  A professional business consultant, Anton Krasnobabtsev, shared his own discoveries with Universarium: <i>‚ÄúWhen introducing the practice of time management, there is always an understanding that you will not be good for everyone, unfortunately.</i>  <i>You can't earn all the money.</i>  <i>All the possibilities of this life do not use.</i>  <i>Need to concentrate</i> .  And on our own, we will add more - and devote time to really important things.  For example, learn useful tools that will help you correctly build all your work. <br><br>  The course has started!  <a href="http://universarium.org/course/452">You will still have time</a> for the first webinar with a lecturer, which will be held on December 21.  Perhaps this is the last time when you have to chase after something. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/297268/">https://habr.com/ru/post/297268/</a></p>
