If you are still using systems a decade ago for some reason and have not yet updated Windows 2003 / XP, perhaps this post will save you time and nerves in the New Year holidays. <br><br>  So, the December update timezone kb3013410 has been released.  If it (or equivalent registry changes) is not installed on 2003 / XP with kb2998527 installed, they will continue to translate time.  The reason is incomplete support for Dynamic DST, there are values ‚Äã‚Äãin the registry, but they are not used for time-shifting actions.  Roughly speaking, only Vista and above (core 6.0) have learned to translate arrows each year in different ways.  <b>Specifically, in 2015, if nothing is done, 2003 / XP with the kb2998527 installed will switch the arrows to summer time (+1 hour) on the night of January 6 to 7, and to winter (-1 hour) on October 25.</b> <br><br>  To prevent this from happening, there is an easy way to remove the time translation checkbox in advance (it appeared again after installing kb2998527), and the correct way is to install kb3013410 (or its equivalent registry changes).  On the home computer, no additional actions are needed, I would advise the server to be restarted, because, as it turned out on October 26, some applications, as well as services (for example, IIS in Exchange) do not understand changes to the timezone before the service is restarted. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  On Windows Vista / Server 2008 and higher, installing kb3013410 right now or until the end of the year is not necessary, and they will not go anywhere.

      Registry files for XP <a href="">here</a> , if anyone should. <br><br>  <b>Theoretical justification:</b> <br><br>  Windows 2003 / XP and earlier versions of Windows operating systems do not support Dynamic DST technology for the actual time change procedure, although the corresponding registry values ‚Äã‚Äãare there (see <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/ru-ru/library">msdn.microsoft.com/ru-ru/library‚Ä¶</a> 85) .aspx Minimum supported - Windows Vista / Windows Server 2008).  This means that they are not technically capable of translating the hands of a clock in different ways in different years.  The kb2998527 patch for Russia establishes the following times, respectively, at the beginning and end of summer time: <br>  start - 00 hours of the first Wednesday of January <br>  end - 02 o'clock last sunday october <br><br>  This was done because the existing DST mechanisms do not allow for a one-time automatic transition in a different way (I tried).  Thus, in 2015 and later, if no action is taken, Windows 2003 / XP will move the clock one hour ahead to the first Wednesday of January (2015 is the night of January 6-7) and the last Sunday of October (2015 is October 25). ). <br><br>  To prevent the translation of arrows in Windows 2003 / XP to occur, you need to install the kb3013410 update (or an equivalent registry edit for XP), or, in extreme cases, uncheck the "() Automatic daylight saving time and back" checkbox.  However, to prevent problems in case of another change in the legislation, I would not recommend removing this checkbox. <br><br>  Once again, the OS with the kernel from 6.0, i.e.  2008 / Vista, fully support Dynamic DST and will not go anywhere in 2015 and beyond.  However, the changes in the old format recordings stored in HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE \ SOFTWARE \ Microsoft \ Windows NT \ CurrentVersion \ Time Zones \, such as in the screenshot below, will be changed.  In this regard, there may be problems in the software that reads and uses these values ‚Äã‚Äãdirectly for the calculation of time.  For the subsections \ Dynamic DST, which determine the time transfer in the new format, no changes are made to Russia. <br><br>  Links to Microsoft: <br>  1) <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2998527/ru">support.microsoft.com/kb/2998527/en</a> update that we installed in October 2014, section "List of known problems" <br>  (...) <br>  Incorrect summer time settings for future years on Windows Server 2003 and Windows XP Embedded <br><br>  If users install this update on Windows Server 2003 or Windows XP Embedded, their systems will continue to use daylight saving time settings for 2014 even after changing the calendar year.  This may result in incorrect display of system time. <br><br>  To solve this problem, users should install the Cumulative Update (scheduled to be released in December, 2014) December before the calendar year changes.  When installing the Russian time zone update and December cumulative updates, their systems apply the correct daylight saving time settings and continue to display the correct time at the end of 2014. <br><br>  2) <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/3013410/ru">support.microsoft.com/kb/3013410/en</a> the December update itself, which is being discussed today.  It replaces kb2981580 and all released before it, incl.  kb2998527.  Such updates are released regularly (especially at the end of the year, they prepare the system for changes in the legislation of different countries, which change the way the arrows are transferred next year), and, as a rule, are cumulative, i.e.  Replace previous obonovaniya. <br><br>  About Windows XP in MSKB does not say anything, because  she has been withdrawn from support since April 8, 2014. <br><br>  <b>UPD</b> Colleagues, do not forget that after making changes to the registry on XP to apply them, you need to re-select the timezone with your hands or with the command control.exe timedate.cpl ,, / Z Russian Standard Time (indicating your time zone), while the current timezone information from HKLM \ SOFTWARE \ Microsoft \ Windows NT \ CurrentVersion \ Time Zones is rewritten to HKLM \ SYSTEM \ CurrentControlSet \ Control \ TimeZoneInformation. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/355600/">https://habr.com/ru/post/355600/</a></p>
