  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Russian projects on Kickstarter in one post</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"> I want to share with you my lists of all domestic (Russian, Ukrainian, Belarusian ...) projects that were launched with varying degrees of success at the COP (Kickstarter).  I observed many of these projects live, I communicated with many authors, backed some projects (gave them money). <br>  I will try to provide the projects with useful comments to make it easier for you to navigate.  But, unfortunately, I found them not all, and did not correspond with all the authors. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/8cc/8df/ec2/8cc8dfec2bc05fe3fef65a867095d9da.jpg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  This list cannot be complete, since projects must be launched from a US or UK resident, so it‚Äôs difficult to keep track of domestic projects, unless the authors themselves go to contact through the media.  If you know more domestic projects - write in the comments, I will add. <br><br>  *** The maximum number of rows in the table for the post is 30, and I need 39. Therefore, I attach a link to the <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/7kzbz93n22nspxh/%25D0%259E%25D1%2582%25D0%25B5%25D1%2587%25D0%25B5%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BD%25D1%258B%25D0%25B5%2520%25D0%25BF%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BA%25D1%2582%25D1%258B%2520%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B0%2520%25D0%259A%25D0%25A1.docx">document in the dropbox</a> , a <a href="https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B7jqlbdemXgET08tY3YtT2dvNWc/edit%3Fusp%3Dsharing">document in google docs</a> and attach the table with a picture.

      <b>And now comments on the projects:</b> <br>  6. <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/968009034/coast-2-coast-indian-ocean-2013">Coast 2</a> is a very weak project.  The authors ask for a large amount, but do not explain why they need it.  And the goal itself - traveling across the ocean does not seem super interesting to the general public. <br>  7. <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1878586756/buba-the-animated-series">Buba</a> - this animated character personally caused pity to me.  His liquid hairs, strange movements.  But the project is childish, I convinced myself.  Despite the fact that the project failed - the author said that he received many good suggestions.  Do not forget that crowdfunding is also a way to express yourself! <br>  9. <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/rakudajin/peoples-omnibus-russia">People's Omnibus</a> is a sociological project telling foreigners about Russia.  It was well decorated, but the target audience was too small.  The traffic attracted good, but the backers saw that the project did not collect money and did not give money.  Here it is the Kickstarter paradox =) By the way, the project went to the COP through Sergey Khvaschuk as an intermediary. <br>  10. <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/630534739/iamthemorning-little-help-for-russian-musicians">Iamthemorning</a> - I will tell you more about this project.  We offered our children free assistance in promoting the project.  We didn‚Äôt do it very well in terms of the Western media, but there are some results, and I‚Äôll tell you about them. <br>  11. <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1098006691/jeff-lloyds-new-album-never-look-back">Jeff Lloyd</a> - no one would even think that this is a guy from Magnitogorsk =) The creator and, apparently, the ideological inspirer of the project is the boy's father.  The family has already started with a <a href="http://boomstarter.ru/projects/31675/jeff_lloyd_-_buduschee_rossii_na_mirovoy_rok-stsene">project on boomstarter</a> , but there they collected some pennies.  The project on the COP has just begun, perhaps something else will happen, the author of the project is actively improving the page.  I can only wish him good luck. <br>  13. <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1194220798/berserk-war-of-the-realms">Berserk</a> - is the output of the largest publisher of board games in Russia at Kickstarter.  I also put my hand to this project and gave small consultations on the company's course.  The effect of my consultations is known only to the authors of the project, but I tried as best I could =) By the way, the project itself is just perfectly decorated.  About him I, most likely, will write more in detail. <br>  14. <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/20five/a-deck-of-simple-playing-cards-printed-by-uspcc">Simple playing cards</a> - a deck of simple cards.  The project went to the COP through Sergey Khvaschuk as an intermediary.  Sergey is the author of his own successful project Eternal Case.  Sergey believes in the power of cross-promotion (advertising of the project in the updates of other projects), so all the projects that he leads as an intermediary can be seen on cross-promotion posts.  The cards are not the most interesting, and the COP is full of the coolest decks, so no money was collected.  It is also worth noting that Tim was the author of this project, who then successfully raised funds for project 34. <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/259704821/the-magic-wallet-slim-and-unique-design-rfid-prote">Magic wallet</a> . <br>  15. <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/woodenshark/lightpack-ambient-backlight-for-your-displays">Lightpack</a> - we saw the project only at night in Russia and many watched it with a sinking heart.  $ 100k on the first day is a phenomenon.  The authors refrain from the title of ‚Äúmarketing geniuses‚Äù, and so far do not tell the secret of their success, citing luck and a well-designed project.  In my opinion this is some kind of fantasy! <br>  16. <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/kolibrios/kolibrios-help-us-hold-our-own-summer-of-code-2013">KolibriOS</a> is a miniature OS, about which developers wrote several times on Habr√©.  In <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/180197/">this topic,</a> you can learn more about it and focus on developers =) <br>  17. <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1684781151/legends-of-eisenwald">Legends of Eisenwald</a> - this game was the first great success of the Belarusian gamedev at the COP.  The guys have an interesting game, good graphics, wonderful fees.  Alexander Dergay wrote about this <a href="http://www.pvsm.ru/startapy/11092/print/">post-mortem</a> , removed from Habr, gave a dozen interviews, and generally behaves very openly and friendly. <br>  19. <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/digitilus/skyjacker-starship-constructor">Skyjacker</a> - another crowdfunding veteran.  This is the third project of Evgeny Zhukov, which was finally crowned with success.  Eugene also gave many interviews and gave several lectures.  Now he is withdrawing projects to the COP as an intermediary and continues to work on his project. <br>  20. <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/dodogames/divine-space-sci-fi-space-arpg">Divine Space</a> - the author of the project, Anti Danilevsky, was probably the first to talk about crowdfunding to Russia.  He wrote several articles on Habr, including his <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/164077/">post-mortem,</a> and noted in an <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/russiankickstart/543046565728084/">article in Hacker magazine</a> .  On FB happy to answer questions.  But only he and Eugene and Alexander are busy people - do not ask them about what is easy to find on the Internet! <br>  21. <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1166550020/humans-must-answer-an-explosive-2d-shmup">Humans must answer</a> is a project from Stalker developers.  And even this did not become a guarantor of good fees.  Charges were sluggish, and the project barely collected the required amount. <br>  23. <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1856015320/slashear-crazy-cartoon-story">Slashear</a> is a visually beautiful game, but the voice changed in the video killed the campaign, as well as the indifference of the press to this project.  Although the creators of the project tried very hard and even made a super-bun for their backers <a href="http://www.slashear.com/bunny-backers.html">here</a> . <br>  24. <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1933897645/locamath-game-in-math-easy-way-to-teach-your-kids-0">Locamath</a> - a super project!  This is a math game for schoolchildren.  Some famous American from America wrote about her even in the tweeter: ‚ÄúBelarusian housewives went to the COP with a learning math application.  I never would have thought that someday I would say something like that. ‚Äù  The project is very well designed, but the creators did not succeed in reaching contacts with the press. <br>  25. <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1476171442/catorize">Catorize</a> is a <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1476171442/catorize">nice</a> little game about a cat, a bit outdated, but it may well still become popular in the appstore. <br>  26. <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/madsword/angry-farmer-real-time-strategy-cross-platform-soc">Angry farmer</a> - the guys were well prepared for the project, they worked hard on the company, laid out their previews for everyone to see, but trollface did not raise money in America and is not info.  reason for the foreign press. <br>  27. <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/344920253/kiddy-vs-universum">Kiddy vs Universum</a> - the brainchild grown on Kanobu.ru.  There you can track the entire life cycle of the game by the entries in the <a href="http://kanobu.ru/pub/364344/">thematic blog</a> .  It was beautifully filed at the COP, but the guys did not succeed in pushing the press.  About them just no one wrote. <br>  28. <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/ufna/doomstalker">Doomstalker</a> - meat mindless shooter, which is boring to watch even in the trailer.  It is funny that the Russian community reacted very negatively to the name of the game, although the foreign reaction did not show such a reaction.  In my opinion, he is from the creators of the project ‚Ññ21 Oceania, which was also unsuccessful. <br>  34. <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/259704821/the-magic-wallet-slim-and-unique-design-rfid-prote">Magic wallet</a> - cool wallet.  I backed it up.  The author of the project Timur is a great guy, judging by our conversations.  I even helped him a little to look for mistakes in English.  texts updates.  But he promised to send the wallet in May, and just now he started production.  This was caused by the shoals of the manufacturer‚Äôs plant, but the fact remains.  Also on this project you can see how important it is to communicate with backers after the end of the campaign.  Tim did not do this, which caused a wave of indignation. <br>  35. <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1323897061/neodrop-interactive-ferrofluid-display">Neodrop</a> is a magnetic toy.  The author of the project is a responsive moderately sociable person, he answered all my questions in due time, for which I am grateful to him.  By the way, his project took place completely without advertising, only due to the internal traffic of the COP.  Some miracle, and only =) <br>  36. <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/952731033/eternalcase-metal-case-for-flash-drive-and-other-s/">Eternal Case</a> - a flash drive in a titanium case from Sergey Khvaschuk, who after the project became a professional intermediary for entering the CS.  Hostess on the note.  The project largely raised funds thanks to 11 cross-promotion posts during the life of the company. <br>  37. <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/608696909/magic-cooking-gloves-integral-part-of-your-bbq-exp%3Fref%3Dlive">Magic cooking gloves</a> - an example of a successful project that failed.  These are stylish barbecue gloves.  They are especially cool in the coloring of "Captain America".  The only pity is that the guys spent the money and could not make gloves on them.  Now they are hiding from the backers, do not answer questions.  Soon they will probably be looking for American structures. <br>  38. <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/2046229129/sammy-icon-8-bit-socks-with-90-s-pixel-art-design">8-bit socks</a> - the project is tiny, but I collected my money.  He was openly promoted in all projects from Ukraine.  Perhaps this played a decisive role. <br>  39. <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1407194640/zephyr-clothing-with-designers-embroideries-0%3Fref%3Dhome_location">Zephyr</a> - a very weak project.  The guys from St. Petersburg could not show in their company that their T-shirts are special.  In the disputes on the FB, they also failed to prove this.  It looks as if they want to sell weak prints on t-shirts.  Although it is not prints, but embroidery.  By the way, the project went to the COP through Sergei Khvaschuk as an intermediary. <br>  40. <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/chechilusa/chechil-usa-smoked-braided-string-cheese-snack">CHECHIL USA</a> - domestic smoked cheese pigtail, which collected $ 27.205.  An unexpected project, isn't it? <br>  41. <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/cradle-of-mir/the-cradle-of-mir-at-burning-man-2013-russian-team">Cradle of MIR</a> - the first team from Russia to win the competition for the construction of an art object at the American Burning Man festival.  The team will build in the desert the Cradle of Peace - a giant pyramid (19 m base and 11 m height), inside which is a layout of the Mir space station on a scale of 1: 3.  The project is still valid. <br><br>  UPD 1. Added graphs to the table.  Thank you <a href="https://geektimes.ru/users/ave/" class="user_link">ave</a> <br>  Added a smoked cheese pigtail project and a MIR space station layout project inside the pyramid 0_o <br>  The updated table can be found <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc%3Fkey%3D0AvwEzF2T0xNwdHdMcWV3ZGdJWFhpSDFYOFF1ck1PWGc">here</a> . <br><br>  UPD 2. Added 7 more projects.  All new projects in <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc%3Fkey%3D0AvwEzF2T0xNwdHdMcWV3ZGdJWFhpSDFYOFF1ck1PWGc">this dock</a> began to make out hyperlinks. <br><br>  47.48.  <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/digitilus/al-skyjacker">SKYJACKER</a> is a project of Evgeny Zhukov, which was launched twice at the CS and did not collect the necessary amount both times.  Then Eugene launched a fundraising not for the game entirely, but for the designer of the spacecraft, which brought him a successful project, which is listed at number 19. <br><br>  I repeat once again, I have nothing to do with Sergey.  I just do not see the point of keeping silent about the information about the projects that I have at my disposal. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/185628/">https://habr.com/ru/post/185628/</a></p>
