Dilip has been an honorary lecturer at Intel (Distinguished Lecturer) for several years.  At Intel, he was instrumental in making a strategic decision to adapt AMD's x86-compatible 64-bit architecture in Intel processors and was the founder of the development of energy-efficient microprocessor cores in Intel products. <br><br>  Prior to joining Intel in 1995, Dr. Bhandarkar spent almost 18 years at Digital Equipment Corporation, where he was responsible for the architecture of processors and systems, as well as performance issues in VAX, Prism, MIPS and Alpha projects.  He also worked at the Texas Instruments research lab for 4 years, working on issues such as the creation of CMD memory, charge-coupled devices, fault-tolerant memory, and computer architecture. <br><br>  Dr. Bhandarkar received 16 US patents and is the author of more than 30 technical articles in various journals, as well as the author of the book Alpha Implementations and Architecture. <br><br>  In 1997, Dilip was elected an honorary member of the IEEE organization (IEEE Fellow) for his contribution to technological leadership in developing the principles of the RISC architecture and analyzing the performance of computer systems.  In 1998, he was recognized as an outstanding graduate of the Indian Institute of Technology in Bombay, where he received a bachelor's degree in electrical engineering in 1970.  Dilip later earned a master‚Äôs and Ph.D. in electrical engineering from Carnegie Mellon University. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/151861/">https://habr.com/ru/post/151861/</a></p>
