What is it?  What are they? </h3><br>  In general, role-playing games (RI) are a rather diverse phenomenon, and table-based role-playing is not the only (though popular) game they are. <br><br>  Usually, people who played exclusively in the computer version of the RI, it seems that the essence (and distinctive features) of role-playing games is the destruction of monsters, gaining experience, swinging the character, and buying / knocking out items.  Based on this, in my opinion, absolutely incorrect premise, computer role-playing games (CWI) began to be considered such games as Diablo II.

      In general, the role-playing game is, first of all, ‚Äúa kind of dramatic action‚Äù, quite special.  In fact, this is the theater of one or several actors playing a play without a clear script, playing for themselves.  Each player tries to get used to the role of his character, and act on the basis of the impulse of the character, not the player.  This is typical for all role-playing games. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The general classification of role-playing games is well described in the <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A0%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B0%25D1%258F_%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B3%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0">wiki</a> , so I see no reason to transfer it here. <br><br><h3>  Desktop RI </h3><br> <a href="http://www.picamatic.com/view/5117564_800px-D%26D_Game_1/"><img alt="http://www.picamatic.com/show/2009/09/18/03/50/5117564_bigthumb.jpg" src="http://www.picamatic.com/show/2009/09/18/03/50/5117564_bigthumb.jpg"></a> <br><br>  Board role-playing games are a separate layer of RI, so called because the simulation of all game situations occurs at the table.  That is, the participants do not require any active actions, except for a verbal description of the actions of the character. <br><br>  Usually one Master and several Players take part in a tabletop role-playing game (how much depends on the game itself).  The master is both the script writer and the ‚Äúserver‚Äù of the game.  He usually comes up with a scenario for the players (in general), monitors compliance with the rules, does all the calculations necessary to determine the success of certain actions of the players, and provides all the information the players need about the game world (what they see, hear, feel ...).  The player also receives under his control one character (sometimes several), and informs the master and other players how he (the character) behaves in this or that situation. <br><br>  To make it clearer, I will give an example of what the Master does and what the Players do. <br><br>  <strong>The development of the plot (Master):</strong> <br><br>  The master decides that in the kingdom (the star empire, the primitive tribe, to inscribe his own) a riot occurs.  The rebels seized the palace and the king (the emperor, the leader ... well, you understand :)) was forced to leave the capital.  He took refuge in his faithful province with a handful of fighters - staunch royalists.  The king learned that the warriors are led by warlock Vasya, and all his closest associates are vampires.  The king begins to look for people willing to help him and destroy the warlock Vasya.  These people are the characters of the Players.  He sets an appropriate task for them, but what exactly the players will do in this situation is only they who decide.  They may, instead of helping the king, go to Vasya and agree on the release of information about the king for a reward.  And so on ... <br><br>  <strong>Game situation (Master and Players):</strong> <br><br>  <em>Master:</em> You see a handful of goblins in front of you.  The largest goblin is striped and armed with a big club. <br>  <em>Player Sasha:</em> I step forward and offer them a peaceful way out (gives a speech). <br>  <em>Master:</em> Performs the necessary calculations, determines that Sasha's speech had an effect on goblins.  Says: "Goblins are very puzzled and thought about your proposal." <br>  <em>Player Masha:</em> I run ahead with a shout: ‚ÄúYou killed my husband.  Let your blood be shed for the redemption of his death! ‚ÄùAnd hack a big goblin with an ax. <br>  <em>Master:</em> Performs a calculation, and decides that Masha missed.  He says: "The big goblin dodged your blow, and, upon seeing your actions, all the other goblins took out a weapon." <br><br><h3>  Game mechanics </h3><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/6eb/950/59b/6eb95059b17e76a3454c0fee6e7f84f1.jpg"><br>  At the root of most desktop role-playing games is a fairly simple problem: how do you know if a player‚Äôs action was successful and how much?  After all, if all the actions of the players are successful, the gameplay will be uninteresting.  To solve this and derivative problems, a tool called Game Mechanics has been created.  Now I will summarize the essence. <br><br>  Usually, a random number is used to determine the success of an action and the degree of its success.  In board games, multi-faceted dice are used to generate random numbers.  In classical systems, bones with the following number of faces are used: 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 20. Obviously, bones provide random numbers within certain limits. <br><br>  But the presence of a random number is not enough - factors such as character class (if a character is a warrior, then his chances to hit the enemy with a sword are higher than that of a magician), his level (an abstract indicator of experience and character‚Äôs overall toughness), his condition the present moment (blinded, stunned, lying on the ground, badly wounded), as well as many others.  In most gaming systems, these parameters affect the number of dice rolls, the value modifiers (+5 to the dice roll) or the result to be obtained on the dice in order for the action to be considered successful.  Also, counter-rolls of the bones are sometimes used (two dice rolls, with the definition of who the result with the modifiers turned out to be higher). <br><br>  As a result, to solve these and some other problems, a lot of gaming systems were formed, adapted for different types of games.  In this issue, I would like to mention several gaming systems that are considered to be classic for desktop role-playing games. <br><br>  <strong>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</strong> <br><img src="http://blogs.eastvalleytribune.com/old_images/46/dndlogo.jpg"><br>  In fact, one of the first commercial gaming systems for desktop role-playing games.  It is adapted primarily for fantasy plots.  The first version of the rules was published back in 1974 and since then the system has seriously changed.  Currently, the latest version of the system is considered to be 4th edition, however, many people around the world play both the third and second editions. <br>  Several other systems have also grown out of this system, adapted to different styles of play and plots.  They all carry in their name "d20". <br>  The D &amp; D system is one of the most popular commercial systems around the world.  This system is used (with some modifications) in a large number of computer games.  Under it, a lot of settings have been developed (in details designed game worlds), which, in turn, have written a great many art books. <br>  <strong>GURPS (Generic Universal RolePlaying System)</strong> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/efe/c9f/75e/efec9f75ebf6077ec90d5689bcb3c67d.png"><br>  The GURPS system is 12 years younger than D &amp; D, and it has also seriously evolved compared to the first version.  It is assumed that it can be used in any game worlds and with any style of play.  The system turned out quite complicated, however, it has a lot of fans around the world. <br><br>  <strong>The Age of Aquarius</strong> <br><br><img src="http://www.picamatic.com/show/2009/09/18/04/00/5117662_bigthumb.JPG"><br>  This is a representative of a rare type of domestic gaming systems.  It came out much later than the previous two systems (when I don‚Äôt know for sure).  The system includes not only the game mechanics, but also the setting.  The system is based on a large number of hexagonal bones, there are no levels and classes in it.  In general, the system is quite simple. <br><br><h3>  What did not say? </h3><br><br>  Behind the scenes were such famous systems as Shadowrun, World of Darkness and many others.  I didn‚Äôt say a word about them, because I‚Äôm practically not familiar with them, but this does not diminish their importance. <br><br>  <em>I stated the main points, if it is still interesting - I can tell you about the main commercial settings for desktop RIs, about thumbnails for them, the main sites of fans of nastolks, and also about other types of RI.</em> <br><br></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/70041/">https://habr.com/ru/post/70041/</a></p>
