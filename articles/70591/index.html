  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Linux in schools?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Hello dear habouksoobschestvo!  Probably everyone has already heard that our government, in the image and likeness of the pioneers in such a matter - the administration of the city of Hamburg - decided to switch to free software in the public sector.  At first I did not attach much importance to such statements.  Well, we spent money on developing ‚Äúour own‚Äù Linux (who counts the budget money here?), We made some noise that the monopoly of Microsoft knows no boundaries, and perhaps it‚Äôs enough.  But no!  Russians don't give up so easily!  Because  My parents work at school, I can authoritatively assert that these were not trivial promises. <br><br>  A small digression: I myself am a user of one of the versions of this OS, but for me it is a necessity dictated by my working position.  There is everything necessary for me in this area of ‚Äã‚Äãsoftware, but no more. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  First, the money for the purchase of licensed software this year did not allocate.  At the same time, the economic background of this step is doubtful.  It is not difficult to dig out in the network that about 60 million rubles were spent on the development of a special budget operating system.  And, if you think about it, would it not have been better to buy a package of necessary software for the same money?  In addition, Microsoft has always supported the sphere of education with its discount program.  In a word, there is something dark about it ... <br><br>  Secondly, teachers are already starting to be sent to courses on the use of this very ‚Äúnew‚Äù Linux.  This destroyed in me the last hope for the sanity of those who encourage this idea.  It is no secret that now the old guard has remained in the schools.  No, you think about it!  People who are often 40-50 or even more years old will be studying Linux.  But not all of them are able to handle the mouse.  Of course, there is an omnipotent console, but this is funny, gentlemen.

      Thirdly, as an experiment, even from 2007, some schools switched to completely free software.  From the side there are even positive reviews about this event, but unfortunately I have no information from inside these institutions.  And the school administration never admits that the experiment failed ... <br><br>  Then we can talk endlessly about the fact that at home all teachers have Windows and the problem of transferring the accumulated material and programs is also relevant ... But do not forget those ‚Äúfor whom‚Äù all this porridge was brewed.  How do you think children at Linux will be at school if they have Windows at home?  Especially doubtful is the benefits of such exercises.  For an hour a week, the child will poke the mouse in the Sneakers (or any other shell), and then frantically search for similar functions in the interface of another operating system.  Even if we assume that because of the availability of the installation disk will be for everyone, not everyone will be able to supply and set up a house at home is a miracle of Russian production.  Not everyone can put themselves at home Windows.  Will a sane child voluntarily give up the abundance of all the great games !?  And not always the parents have their own computer.  Two operating systems may be the way out, but in my opinion very few students will run Linux in such conditions. <br><br>  And let's not forget about universities that have already stocked up with licenses for a long term.  It turns out all this money was also thrown to the wind. <br><br>  The idea of ‚Äã‚Äãour government is not completely clear.  With an overwhelming monopoly in the whole world, OS and software produced by Microsoft, although not very beloved, they are going to teach everyone Linux.  Personally, I see this as someone's personal benefit and nothing more.  Perhaps someone here will be able to give a sensible explanation of such actions, because otherwise you just need to do something.  I love my country, but how long will we go our own way? <br><br>  PS Why was such a budget needed to create the next Linux build?  Even on the forum of the company Armada, which ‚Äúwon‚Äù the trend for development, this question has already been raised repeatedly: <a href="http://linux.armd.ru/ru/forum/">linux.armd.ru/ru/forum</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/70591/">https://habr.com/ru/post/70591/</a></p>
