For 5 years of studying in this specialty, I realized that <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A1%25D0%25B8%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BC%25D0%25BD%25D1%258B%25D0%25B9_%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B7">system analysis</a> is the art of solving problems in almost any human activity.  No matter what you do - you create a startup, open a restaurant or organize a conference, if you initially study well the problems of the area in which you are going to make changes, then the efficiency of your activity will increase.  Not for nothing, they say that the identified problem is 50% of the solution. <br><br>  In this article I want to share one idea for a startup that emerged from life.  The fact is that I like to attend all sorts of events: concerts, festivals, open airs, etc.  And in the place where I live now, dozens of different events take place around me (a similar situation is common to all big cities).  And the following problem periodically arises in front of me: how to keep abreast of all relevant and interesting events taking place around me.  I began to study this topic and realized that at the moment there is no effective solution for searching for events on the Internet.  Moreover, I also investigated the situation on the part of the organization of events, which also showed my problem areas.  Under the cut, you can see the results of my little research. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  Participation in the event </h4><br>  I did a little research on what solutions there are currently on the Internet in the field of event search. <br><ul><li>  <b>Social networks</b> <br>  Now most people publish their events in social networks.  They can be private (private) or public (public).  Public events can be viewed through event catalogs (vkontakte, facebook).  To access private events, you must have an event organizer as a friend or be a member of one organizing group. </li><li>  <b>Regional Event Catalogs</b> <br>  - <a href="http://www.kudapoiti.info/">kudapoiti.info</a> <br>  - <a href="http://www.moscowout.ru/">moscowout.ru</a> <br>  - <a href="http://www.lookatme.ru/cities/moscow/events">lookatme.ru</a> <br>  Here, either the sites themselves collect events and some have the opportunity for the organizers to publish events themselves. </li><li>  <b>International Event Catalogs</b> <br>  - <a href="http://eventful.com/">eventful.com</a> <br>  - <a href="http://www.whatsonwhen.com/">whatsonwhen.com</a> <br>  Here the eventful site is of particular interest.  It works as follows.  Users from different countries post events.  All events are collected in a directory where location is the main reason for classification.  After that, any user can find the set of events of interest to him by specifying his location.  Or you can log in to the site through facebook and then the system itself will issue events from your habitat zone.  There's still a bunch of all sorts of features, such as the <a href="http://eventful.com/demand">demand it</a> service - the ability for fans of a performer to collectively influence the events in their habitat zone. </li><li>  <b>Thematic event catalogs</b> <br>  There is a whole galaxy of sites where events accumulate according to different criteria. <br>  - <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/events/coming/">habrahabr.ru</a> - It-events <br>  - <a href="http://events.linkedin.com/">linkedin.com</a> - business events <br>  - <a href="http://www.last.fm/events">last.fm</a> - music events <br>  - <a href="http://lanyrd.com/">lanyrd.com</a> - social conference directory <br>  - <a href="http://www.meetup.com/">meetup.com</a> - social network of local communities.  Allows you to create events within communities. <br>  - <a href="http://plancast.com/">plancast.com</a> - social service for the collective creation of events. <br>  - <a href="http://startupafisha.ru/">startupafisha.ru</a> - poster startup events. <br>  - <a href="http://theoryandpractice.ru/">theoryandpractice.ru</a> - educational events. </li><li>  <b>All sorts of communities, forums and blogs</b> <br>  A lot of events are published in different online communities, for example in the livejournal - <a href="http://www.livejournal.ru/communities/62">http://www.livejournal.ru/communities/62</a> </li><li>  <b>Search engines</b> </li></ul><br>  I intentionally did not describe here the advantages and disadvantages of each service.  But we can safely say that not one of the services described above does not provide a comprehensive solution in the field of event search.  For example, the real problem that travelers may encounter when they look for events occurring during their journey.  Imagine you are going to make a tour of three cities in Europe: Amsterdam, Berlin and Paris.  And now try to find the events that are interesting for you, passing in these cities along the way, through any of the methods described above.  A more difficult task ahead of you if you go to Japan, for example :-) <br>  Here, a solution is needed that would comprehensively satisfy the need to search for events anywhere in the world.  By this decision I mean an information system that has the following functions: <br><ul><li>  The system collects complete information about all the events taking place anywhere in the world. </li><li>  Events are conveniently organized in the event directory. </li><li>  Events have a full description depending on the type. </li><li>  The event catalog has tools for quickly finding the necessary events: search, filter, sort, group, view (list, map, calendar). </li><li>  The system is effectively integrated with a profile in one of the social networks and on the basis of it selects interesting and relevant events according to the criteria of habitat, interests, favorite music, etc. </li><li>  It is possible to engage in the process of creating events. </li><li>  Events and their organizers have ratings. </li><li>  The system should be integrated with external services (Outlook, Google Calendar, iCal) and help plan your leisure time more efficiently. </li><li>  The service is integrated with various mobile platforms through applications to receive information about events promptly both in time and location. </li></ul><br><h4>  Event organization </h4><br>  The above is related to the events of the participants.  And what happens on the part of the organizers?  I began to study this topic and came across this.  In the west, there is the term <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Event_management">event management</a> - a methodology for organizing all sorts of events: from weddings to international conferences.  Naturally, it also has its own IT solutions: <br><ul><li>  <b>Online event-management</b> <br>  - <a href="http://www.eventbrite.com/l/event-management-online">eventbrite.com</a> <br>  - <a href="http://www.artegis.com/">artegis.com</a> <br>  - <a href="http://www.cvent.com/">cvent.com</a> <br>  These systems are similar to the <a href="http://www.onlineprojects.ru/pm/">online project management system</a> , but sharpened specifically for organizing events online with such a set of tools as online registration, online ticketing service, calendar, alerts and more. </li><li>  <b>Catalogs of service providers for organizing events (vendors)</b> <br>  - <a href="http://www.eventective.com/">www.eventective.com</a> <br>  - <a href="http://www.mypartyplanner.com/">mypartyplanner.com</a> <br>  - <a href="http://www.eventvendors.com/">eventvendors.com</a> <br>  American sites are mainly represented here, as the infrastructure of event organizations is very developed there. </li><li>  <b>Online ticketing systems</b> <br>  - <a href="http://ticketbud.com/">icketbud.com</a> <br>  - <a href="http://www.ticketleap.com/">ticketleap.com</a> <br>  - <a href="http://www.etickets.to/">etickets.to</a> <br>  These systems allow you to tie the online ticketing system to the site. <br></li><li>  <b>Event promotion</b> <br>  - <a href="http://eventasaur.us/">eventasaur.us</a> </li></ul><br><br>  It does not present all the proposed solutions that exist at the moment.  But we have the same situation as with the search for events - there is no integral solution for the online organization of events.  Each of the described services represents one of the aspects of event management, but not one of them does not provide all the tools at once.  And they miss the main point: the most effective way to create a successful event is to involve potential participants in the process of creating it. <br>  In social networks, this mechanism is partially implemented, but most likely it is more focused on event marketing, rather than on collective event creation.

      To understand what I mean, consider an example of organizing a hike. <br>  Event Type: Private Event - Campaign <br>  Time: coming weekend <br>  Location: nearest mountains, forest <br>  Number of participants: 5-6 people <br><br>  What sequence of steps is necessary to go through in order to conduct such an event? <br><br>  Scheme for the implementation of the event: <br><ul><li>  <b>Event concept</b> <br>  Goals: <br>  - follow a certain route <br>  - relax in the taiga bath <br>  - make beautiful pictures <br>  - just have a good rest :-) </li><li>  <b>Event program</b> <br>  Each type of event has its own implementation program.  In this case, the program is a detailed action plan for the implementation of this event.  For this type of event as hiking, the following basic steps can be distinguished: <br>  1. Staffing the team and assigning roles. <br>  2. Development of the route and route schedule. <br>  3. Equipment, supplies, medicines <br>  4. Collecting and shipping <br>  5. Route </li><li> <b>Calculations</b> <br>  Here it is necessary to clearly define what and how much of this is necessary in order to carry out this event. <br>  - Maps <br>  - Equipment <br>  - Food and water <br>  - Medicines <br>  - Transport <br>  The final document here is the event budget, where the final amount is calculated for its implementation. </li><li>  <b>Raising the necessary funds (fund rising)</b> <br>  In this example, a simple event is presented both in type and in scale, therefore the attraction of funds here is limited to the distribution of expenses between the participants of the campaign on equal shares, that is, a charge.  But if we take, for example, a major event as a festival, then the attraction of funds can come from completely different sources: pre-sale of tickets, social investment, sponsorship, etc. </li><li>  <b>Event preparation (setting)</b> <br>  After the necessary funds have been collected, the event preparation phase begins: the purchase of necessary supplies and equipment, the collection of backpacks, the preparation of a route map, etc. </li><li>  <b>Event management</b> <br>  When an event has passed into the stage of direct implementation (in our example, this is the stage of ‚Äúcollecting and sending‚Äù), the process of operational management begins.  Here you need tools such as task management, calendar, network schedule, event status panel, etc ... In our example with a hike, operational management is limited to the distribution of roles (campfire, cook, responsible for breaking tents, etc.) and responsibilities.  The task list is a hike route, where for each check-point it is written what needs to be done. </li><li>  <b>‚ÄúPost-event activity‚Äù</b> <br>  And when the event is completed, the results are summarized in the form of collecting content (photos, videos, artifacts), discussing errors and finding their solutions, proposing ideas for new events, etc. </li></ul><br>  This scheme may well fit almost any type of event with small additions.  For example, for major events such as concerts, festivals, conferences, we can single out the ‚ÄúContracting Out‚Äù stage (Liacing), where all sorts of agreements are made with various organizations (room rental, equipment rental, contracts with performers, etc.) <br>  Now imagine if this event creation process is implemented in an online environment.  That is, it is such a system that consistently conducts the event organizer through all stages of creating the event described above, allowing people and resources to be involved in this process using different methods. <br><br><h4>  Conclusion </h4><br>  To summarize all of the above.  If we combine both aspects of the event (participation and organization), then we get a global information system that performs two main functions: <br><ul><li>  Provides tools for more efficient event management. </li><li>  Accumulates all events occurring anywhere in the world. </li></ul><br>  In this article I described the problem that currently exists in the field of participation and organization of events in the Internet environment.  I already have a solution that I want to describe in the next article.  But first, I want to understand how relevant the problem is, maybe there are already some solutions that solve it, etc.  In a word, I want to hear competent feedback. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/127500/">https://habr.com/ru/post/127500/</a></p>
