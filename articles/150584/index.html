  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Why ITIL to the usual average administrator (10-500 PCs)</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Hey.  At once I will say that the topic is applicable not only to administrators, but also to freelancers, outsourcers. <br>  I recently passed the training ‚ÄúHF421S, ITIL Foundation for IT Service Managment‚Äù, under the impression I bring <a href="http://letter.com.ua/phrase/index.php%3Fid%3D382">Prometheus fire</a> to the masses. <br>  I hope most people know what ITIL is, for the rest, an <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/ITIL">excerpt from the wiki</a> : <br><blockquote>  ITIL (pronounced ‚ÄúITIL‚Äù, English - Information Technology Infrastructure Library) is a library that describes the best practices used in practice for organizing the work of departments or companies engaged in the provision of information technology services. </blockquote><br>  There is an opinion that ITIL is serious, difficult and confusing, it is necessary only for very large companies, and the majority copes with everything ‚Äúon the knee‚Äù, keeps it in memory, and this is normal and convenient. <br>  By no means. <br>  Following ITIL principles helps, first of all, a company administrator of any size to work calmly, steadily, and planned.  It's simple. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  ITIL libraries are like they did in other IT companies the best.  The reverse is also true: IT can be done in the best possible way using ITIL recommendations. <br>  It is noteworthy that IT is the same everywhere, so everyone uses ITIL in different ways, often without knowing about its existence. <br>  In fact, if an administrator does not work with his feet, but with his head, he will come, step by step, to what is described in ITIL on the issues that concern him. <br>  I did just that. <br>  The difference between following the recommendations and independent inventions is in the cost of the experience gained (the number of erroneous experiments, time and money spent). <br>  In addition, you don‚Äôt think about many processes and solutions, because there is no need (incidents, requirements) for their modeling. <br>  From my experience, I have highlighted a few basic examples of popular administrative problems in small companies: <br><ol><li>  Working with incidents and user requests usually takes most of the work time, is least effective (time / tasks), kills any planning and brings chaos. <br></li><li>  Changes (update, installation) in the IT infrastructure entail the fall of everything, and the victorious solution of new problems by the invaluable night administrator shifts. <br></li><li>  Changing the administrator (often the only one) leads to new expenses and downtime in IT, as the new admin does not know anything, is looking for everything, reworking other uncomfortable crutches into his favorite crutches, and also does not write documentation. <br></li><li>  Risks are discussed in a rather abstract way, ‚Äúwhat if‚Äù, ‚Äúmaybe‚Äù, ‚Äúwell, I told you,‚Äù ‚Äúwell, now it works,‚Äù ‚Äúwe don't need super, just to work‚Äù ‚Äîthe main tags of such reasoning. <br></li><li>  Backup and restore procedures are subject to discussion for a maximum of a month after a serious failure, as long as the boss does not see the bill for the purchase of a SOHO collider. <br></li><li>  etc.  administrators act with a soul, conscientiously, better than anyone, but for some reason they still cannot build quality work and service services <s>and hate people more and more</s> . <br></li></ol><br>  To my great surprise, on the third day of the training, when the holistic picture gathered, I suddenly suddenly realized how easy it was to organize servicing the customer infrastructure, earn more, grow more, save time, effort, nerves, do not swear over trifles with customers and employees etc. <br>  A great surprise was caused because I did not learn anything fundamentally new, and instead of the expected mountain of bureaucratic problems I saw opportunities for excellent process optimization. <br><br>  So.  Still, why ITIL ordinary average administrator (10-500 PCs)? <br>  The ITIL briefly and clearly describes the principles, the adherence to which will help ease your work and establish the desired IT work in the company. <br>  Options for the above examples: <br><ol><li>  A simple, working <a href="http://www.otrs.com/ru/">Service Desk</a> will help solve problems with incidents and the timing of their resolution.  An analysis of incidents will provide insights into bottlenecks, which are usually quite small within small companies. <br></li><li>  Using Change Management will allow you to get rid of many problems due to trivial mistakes due to stupidity, due to carelessness or ignorance. <br></li><li>  Documenting infrastructure is not as bad as it seems at first glance.  Keeping documents up-to-date within Change Management requires little effort and saves a lot of time. <br>  And maintaining an internal knowledge base on the simplest <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/qa/4680/">wiki engine will</a> save time in solving problems, or even provide an excellent self-service opportunity for users. <br></li><li>  Understanding of risks and their correct assessment help identify critical services, optimize infrastructure, find and eliminate errors, etc., ultimately get rid of a headache through a reasoned fundraising, or complete transfer of responsibility to top management. <br></li><li>  Backups can be a simple automated procedure, because you already have everything planned, planned out, risks identified, accidental breakdowns minimized, and management has allocated money because it has already estimated the profitability of this operation and allocated the necessary funds. <br></li><li>  etc.  administrators work quietly at scheduled hours, services in perpetual uptime, the customer / employer is satisfied <s>and agrees to pay increases, resources are released, new customers are attracted, finally you can start your own business, not a routine and find time to go to the store for a new Bentley</s> . <br></li></ol></div>
