  <section class="page js-page"><h1>A good method of dealing with SMS fraud. Take the XXX rub on stamps</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Preamble - a lot of short numbers are used to distribute porn, which is a violation of the law.  Let's try to prove the involvement of operators in the distribution and trade of pornography, i.e.  to the crime under Art.  242 of the Criminal Code.  We will use this as a ‚Äúsacred cow‚Äù for the authorities. <br><br>  It can be assumed (although it is obvious) that the operator is profitable sms fraud.  After all, the operator receives a considerable part of the cost of SMS to a short number. <br><br>  I propose to consider a mechanism that, under the current legislation, will allow us to take actions to combat SMS fraud. 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"

        </script>
      <br>
      I propose to do this by means of a letter (sample below) to local regulatory organizations.  In our case, this is the prosecutor's office (region / district, etc.), the State Communications Superintendent, Department K. <br><br>  Sample letter below. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  To the prosecutor's office (region / city, etc.) <br>  the second letter is to the state communication supervisor. <br>  from (your coordinates) <br><br>  I ask you to initiate a criminal case under Article 242 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation. Article 242. Illegal distribution of pornographic materials or objects against the company ZZZ. <br><br>  I, as a user of the Internet, are increasingly confronted with the fact that numerous sites on the Internet publish images and video files of pornographic, vulgar content (if you wish, you can attach a list).  The publication of these materials is contrary to Article 242 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation. <br><br>  Many of the sites that distribute pornography offer to buy access to the content by sending a paid SMS message to the short numbers of the mobile operator.  Such numbers are very diverse, I don‚Äôt have the opportunity to list the numbers.  After sending the SMS to the numbers indicated on the sites, funds are withdrawn from the cell phone account.  It is alleged that by sending SMS to the specified numbers I can purchase pornographic materials in electronic form, or the right to view them. <br><br>  I ask you to find out whether ZZZ is involved in the sale or organization of the sale of pornography, on the basis that payment for access to pornographic material occurs with the help of ZZZ, and the company itself receives income, perhaps from 10% to 50% from the cost of SMS. <br><br>  Based on the foregoing, as well as on the basis that the actions performed by the company ZZZ are signs of a crime under Art.  242 of the Criminal Code, I ask you to initiate a criminal case against the company ZZZ. <br><br>  - end of letter <br>  <i>I believe that if you make two more copies - one to the Presidential Administration of the Russian Federation, the other to the Ministry of Communications of the Russian Federation, then there may be a little more benefit.</i> <br><br>  I suggest you, dear user, to adjust the letter to fit your needs, coordinates, district, etc., print and send by registered mail. <br>  It is possible that this letter is not entirely correct from a formal, legal point of view, but then every citizen has the right to write a letter to the authorities.  And this citizen is absolutely not obliged to know how to write letters correctly - because when you call the police to report a rowdy drunk neighbor (for example) or another violation of the law, the police do not require you to ‚Äúapply in the form prescribed by the charter‚Äù. <br><br>  I do not know how much the stamps cost, but I suppose it is inexpensive.  It seems to me that with a sufficient number of such letters throughout the country, we have every chance of forcing operators to be more careful in choosing partners and providing services on short numbers. <br><br>  Let's fight :) <br><br>  PS / I think that those who make money by selling SMS content are also extremely interested in such a letter and action.  Why - I think they will guess. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/89451/">https://habr.com/ru/post/89451/</a></p>
