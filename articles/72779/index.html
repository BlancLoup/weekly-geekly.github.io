  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Acer 5738ZG</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img src="http://tinyurl.com/yhdsmzl" align="left" alt="image">  Dear habravchane, I offer you a brief overview of the latest generation laptop from Acer.  The model of the average price category (22k ‚Äã‚Äãrubles) is positioned as a home multimedia computer and has a number of distinctive qualities, including a discrete video card. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The laptop is provided for testing <a href="http://www.becompact.ru/notebook/acer/aspire/ACER-Aspire-5738ZG-423G25Mi">becompact by</a> habrau <a href="http://geektimes.ru/users/mkoroleva/" class="user_link">mkoroleva</a> in the hope of promoting an online store in the community.  Will she do it?  Let's get a look.  The laptop is positioned by the company as a universal multimedia solution for home and ... e ... office.  As for the office checked - flash vkontakte does not lag, fun farm 3 does not slow down.  And what the manufacturer is ready to offer everyone else?  As follows from advertising, the main marketing chips of this laptop are: a 16: 9 screen for watching movies, a keyboard with a digital block on the right for bookkeeping, and a special button next to the touchpad, disabling this touchpad so that keystrokes do not pull the cursor.  Consider the laptop sequentially, by component. <br><br><h3>  Processor companions </h3><br>  The standard core2duo with 2 GHz onboard is installed in the laptop.  Everything or almost everything is known about this heroic processor, therefore I will limit myself to a screenshot of cpu-z.  The processor is enough to cope with most of the existing software and not very demanding games like lineage.  Also, 3 gigabytes of RAM is inserted into the computer (apparently out of respect for 32-bit operating systems) which can be expanded to 8. Winchester is represented by a 2.5 "sata model of 250 gigabytes. <br><img src="http://tinyurl.com/yhvvxdr" alt="image">

    <h3>  Video </h3><br>  Onboard there is a discrete graphics card nVidea G 105M, which roughly corresponds to the GeForce 9300 - the video card of the most basic level.  Of the games she draws only rather old names - warcraft 3, lineage, quake.  An attempt to launch Assasin Creed or Hellgate on it showed a slideshow even with minimal graphic settings.  King's bounty slide show does not show, but only with minimal settings.  Nevertheless, the built-in video processor allows you to seriously accelerate watching videos, and with the right player, playing full hd will be smooth and eye-catching :). <br><img src="http://tinyurl.com/yhonmlc" alt="image"><br><br><h3>  Keyboard </h3><br>  As you know, the wrong location of the manufacturers' favorite Fn key or placing Break in the blue zone of the keyboard (together with Fn) can deliver quite a few pleasant minutes when using a laptop.  As already mentioned, the laptop has a full keyboard - on the right is a full-fledged digital block that allows accountants to enter numbers with unprecedented speed.  The Ctrl key is located where it is supposed to be - in the lower left corner (shown in green).  Insert and Delete are on top (shown in red) and to the left of them are the usual Break and PrtSc.  But the Home, End, PageUp and PageDown keys have traditionally been unlucky - freeing up space for digital keyboards, the kind laptop manufacturer placed them in the upper right corner, which seriously complicated the use of a laptop with text editors other than vi and emacs.  You should also pay attention to the keys themselves - small gaps are made between them (like on macbooks), which separates the keys well and reduces the number of false positives when the finger touches the edges of adjacent keys. <br><img src="http://tinyurl.com/yzsjvpu" alt="image"><br><br><h3>  Touchpad </h3><br>  Large enough and convenient.  Right vertical "hole" for vertical scrolling.  The manufacturer claims multitouch - but only three actions are available (zoom, switching to scrolling mode without the scroll wheel and scrolling left-right) that I work very badly.  But to the right of the touchpad there is a special button by clicking on which you turn it off.  It is very convenient when used with an external mouse - random touch pad touch does not pull the cursor. <br><br><h3>  Communications </h3><br>  The laptop has wi-fi up to n (draft), a network, a modem, four usb ports (two on the left and two on the right), HDMI, d-sub and a universal card reader.  WiFi has a soft button (button on the case, but only works when the program is installed).  The presence of HDMI can not but rejoice - the connection of the laptop to the home full hd TV went without complications and I was able to play full hd video on the big screen without problems.  But what is not encouraging is the lack of an express card and bluetooth.  And if the first is not critical (either a folding mouse or a remote control usually live in it), then the lack of bluetooth is very upsetting.  Of course, the positioning of a laptop as stationary is understandable, and in most cases it will not be necessary for a wireless mouse or a presentation controller - but in itself is an unpleasant fact. <br><br><h3>  Screen </h3><br>  The 16: 9 TN matrix has a diagonal of 15.6 inches and a glossy finish.  The matrix is ‚Äã‚Äãoverclocked satisfactorily, there are no noticeable loops when moving objects around the screen.  LED backlight partially compensates for the lack of viewing angles of the TN matrix - when the vertical deviation of the colors begin to swim a little later than usual.  In general, the screen makes a favorable impression. <br><br><h3>  Sound </h3><br>  ‚ÄúDolby home theater‚Äù is modestly written on the laptop case.  I do not know what the manufacturer meant, but the sound is clearly better than in most notebooks of this class. <br><br><h3>  Battery </h3><br>  As with most ‚Äúhome‚Äù laptops, with an average screen brightness and acer advertising screensaver running (50% cpu load, hdd, camera access), we have about two and a half hours of battery life. <br><br><h3>  Ubuntu :) </h3><br>  Established normally.  I found a video card, screen, wired and wireless networks.  Unfortunately, they didn‚Äôt earn sleep, and the wifi off buttons, touchpad.  The tambourine is being repaired. <br><br><h3>  Total </h3><br>  Conclusions, of course, make you.  I can highlight what I liked and did not like in the laptop. <br><br><h4>  pros </h4><br><ul><li>  Screen 16: 9 1366x768 with LED backlight </li><li>  Full-size keyboard with separate buttons </li><li>  Discrete graphics card </li><li>  Good sound </li><li>  Touchpad off button </li><li>  Webcam </li><li>  4 usb slots </li><li>  Card reader </li></ul><br><h4>  Minuses </h4><br><ul><li>  No bluetooth </li><li>  No express card </li><li>  PgUp, PgDn, Home and End in an awkward place keyboard </li><li>  Video card is discrete, but one of the weakest in the series. </li></ul><br><br></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/72779/">https://habr.com/ru/post/72779/</a></p>
