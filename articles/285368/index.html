  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How do you rate your developer position?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  I am looking for a job in the position of Senior Developer - in this spirit begins the graph purpose in most resumes.  The point here is not only that the company is looking for a developer for this particular position, but rather that the developer, for his part, appreciated not only himself, but also other developers of the company, while he was preparing a resume.  In today's post, I would like to consider how developers and recruiters make this assessment. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  First, let's define who is who: <br><ul><li>  Junior Developer - 75% of his work should be controlled by Timlid; </li><li>  Intermediate Developer (Intermediate Developer) - Timlid controls 50% of his work; </li><li>  Senior developer - Timlid controls 25% of his work; </li><li>  Timlid - 0% of his work is controlled by Timlid (reports only to the Project Manager) </li></ul><br>  What determines the position of the developer?  Many people define this with knowledge, experience, certifications, ability to solve problems quickly and efficiently, etc.  But, just as important is the previous place of work, because the developers are trying to rise up in the career and material sense.  But there is another side - the overall level compared to other developers. <br><br>  Suppose a developer works in an Intermediate Developer position in a medium-sized company in a not-so-large city, and he has a choice: <ul><li>  Become a Timlide; </li><li>  Become a Senior Developer; </li><li>  Become a Junior Developer </li></ul><br>  The version ‚ÄúCome up with a brilliant idea, create your startup and take on the responsibilities of Timlid or the Project Manager (or all at once)‚Äù - we will not consider, since this is a topic for another conversation. <br><br>  I think you are a little surprised that Intermediate Developer can take almost any position! 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>
        <script>
          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      The scenario for Timlid may be as follows: the developer begins to work hard on his knowledge and skills.  He explores various issues, participates in various international conferences, answers on forums, maintains a professional blog, writes articles for journals, actively participates in meetings of user groups, undergoes certification, creates an open source project.  The developer becomes a famous person at the level of his country.  After that, his chance to become Timlid in a current or similar company increases substantially. <br><br>  In the case of a Senior Developer, everything is much simpler.  If the developer is not lazy, then he gradually grows to the position of Senior Developer.  It is only a matter of time and effort that the developer makes. <br><br>  We come to the most interesting part, about how an Intermediate Developer can become a Junior Developer! <br>  No, you do not need to do anything at your job!  Otherwise, you can just be fired (and then do not say that I did not warn you) ... One of the ways to return to the position of Junior Developer is to get a job in a large foreign company.  If the aforementioned developer does not live in the US, and wants to go to Microsoft, for example, to the <a href="http://haacked.com/articles/AboutHaacked.aspx">Phil Haak</a> team, then the likelihood that he will qualify for the Intermediate Developer position is very small. <br><br>  The conclusion suggests one thing: you should always correctly assess your level in relation to those developers with whom you will work. <br><br>  The obvious question is: how to assess the level of future colleagues? <br><br>  In the case of teams that create well-known products and lead an active lifestyle on the Web - this is quite simple.  For non-public teams, I recommend researching their company's website or, if possible, downloading a trial version of their product. <br><br>  So, you write a resume for a specific position.  At the moment, I am sure that you are doing it more meaningfully.  But, unfortunately, as a rule, companies interview several people for one job.  There are cases when they come to the post below the current one.  For example, the Senior Developer has reached the position of Timlid, but sends a resume to the position of Senior Developer.  And there are many reasons for this: <ul><li>  At the moment, the company does not have a Timlid position; </li><li>  The developer is afraid of responsibility in a higher position; </li><li>  The candidate clearly underestimates himself. </li></ul><br>  A bad recruiter will immediately accept a candidate for the current position.  The motivation is: <ul><li>  Ability to reduce price / quality ratio; </li><li>  Stimulates other team members to improve their knowledge; </li><li>  Eliminates the need to listen to other candidates. </li></ul><br>  A good recruiter will try to find a suitable place for this candidate.  Perhaps in another team.  Or it may even refuse a candidate for the following reasons: <br><ul><li>  The team should work as a coordinated mechanism.  And if one wheel is bigger than the others, then this may be the reason for the possible failure of the whole mechanism; </li><li>  A person intends to change his place sooner or later.  Perhaps take another place in the team.  In our case, a new project will soon open, where he can test his strength; </li><li>  It is necessary to find the best among the Senior Developers, but not Timlid among the Senior Developers. </li></ul><br>  Of course, the division into ‚Äúgood‚Äù and ‚Äúbad‚Äù recruiter is conditional and depends on the goals of the company and the current situation. <br><br>  However, most often come developers who have not yet reached the expected level.  What to do with them?  Again, take a look at this situation from different angles.  A bad recruiter simply does not hire a candidate.  Good will ask the following questions: <ul><li>  Can we train him?  Is it possible to spend time and company money on this?  (Of course, this is an option for the Younger Developer); </li><li>  Can we retrain him?  (for example, ASP.NET Intermediate Developer, decided to become Silverlight Intermediate Developer. The fact that a person already owns a lot of skills and there is no need to prepare it from scratch is important); </li><li>  Can we find someone better at this moment in time (the deadline for the project came up, without comments); </li></ul><br>  Feel the difference?  A bad recruiter solves a problem quickly and simply, a good recruiter is efficient with a look at the future. <br><br>  I hope that I convinced you that the position of the developer is not always easy to determine.  But, if you are a developer, please define it for your next job more clearly. <br><br><hr><br>  <a href="https://megamozg.ru/users/dmitry_zhariy/" class="user_link">Dmitry_Zhariy</a> says: <br>  <b>Read this text in English!</b> <br><img src="http://k.min.us/ilPp06.png" align="left">  Try to read the text of this article in English in order to improve your skills and goodness. <br>  The following link leads to a parallel (bilingual; mixed, English and Russian) version of this article.
