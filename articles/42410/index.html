IBM has <a href="http://www.informationweek.com/news/services/saas/showArticle.jhtml%3FarticleID%3D210700289%26subSection%3DEnterprise%2BApplications">announced</a> that it is moving to open beta testing of its social network resource <a href="https://bluehouse.lotus.com/front/webfront/chat">Bluehouse</a> .  Blue is the corporate color of the company, due to which it is sometimes called Big Blue, and house in the name of the resource replaces the word space that has become traditional for Web 2.0. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Another social "space", some may say.  Yes, space, but it focuses not on the mass user, but on the use in corporations, not very large companies and in any other organizations interested in using social network services to support their business processes, both internal and external.  In other words, Enterprise Web 2.0. <br><br>  Also, by and large, not so hot some news, especially for the American market.  That's the way it is, but here there are several circumstances that make it possible to consider this event as a significant one. <br><br>  Before listing, I‚Äôm noting that this is not about any other unknown startup breaking through to the market, but about the patriarch of this market, a company that, as we know, is almost never mistaken in its strategic decisions.  So‚Ä¶

      Firstly, Bluehouse is not the first and, as the IBM product in the field of business social sphere has repeatedly emphasized at its presentations, which means that <b>Enterprise Web 2.0 is considered by the company as an important IT component of this market</b> . <br><br>  Secondly, the new resource, in fact, is SaaS (on-demand / subscription) - a version of the previously released to the market social network system Lotus Connections, supplied ‚Äúin possession‚Äù (on-premise) for work on corporate servers (in Intranet).  It follows that <b>IBM considers the SaaS model of service delivery as equitable with the more traditional software delivery model</b> . <br><br>  Thirdly, both versions (Lotus Connections and Bluehouse) are oriented towards interaction with the ‚Äústandard‚Äù office programs of the Lotus system running on local computers.  So, in this regard, we can say that <b>IBM, clearly not admitting to this, professes the concept of Software + Service, previously proclaimed by Microsoft.</b> <br><br>  Fourth, Bluehouse, like any other SaaS system, can be attributed to working in ‚Äúcloud‚Äù (cloud computing), but this resource also works on a platform that is also located in the ‚Äúcloud‚Äù.  In other words, we can say that Bluehouse is a cloud computing squared, which means that <b>IBM at all times rushed into these very ‚Äúclouds‚Äù, challenging its pioneer Amazon</b> . <br><br>  And finally, I venture to say that IBM‚Äôs almost simultaneous access to Enterprise 2.0 and cloud computing is not only a sign of the times.  This, and it seems to me, is the <b>last signal, which marks the end of the second wave of start-up fever in the Internet domain and its associated ‚Äú <a href="http://www.itechbridge.com/forum/index.php%3Fshowtopic%3D123209">web-twin start-up culture</a> ‚Äù</b> (the second article on business-oriented start-ups is <a href="http://www.itechbridge.com/forum/index.php%3Fshowtopic%3D124058">here</a> ). <br><br>  A more detailed analysis of these factors with all the necessary links, plus some additional considerations on cloud computing, those interested in all these questions can be found in the <a href="http://www.itechbridge.com/forum/index.php%3Fshowtopic%3D122395">full version of this note</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/42410/">https://habr.com/ru/post/42410/</a></p>
