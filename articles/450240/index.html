  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Walmart opened the first AI-managed store.</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/nl/wo/97/nlwo97k1021ilexd_5p9k1xhdag.jpeg"><br><br><p>  Recently, the largest US supermarket chain <a href="https://news.walmart.com/2019/04/25/walmarts-new-intelligent-retail-lab-shows-a-glimpse-into-the-future-of-retail-irl">presented</a> what it calls the ‚Äústore of the future.‚Äù  A large supermarket based in Levittown, New York, uses dozens of advanced technologies.  Including - interactive displays and cameras connected to the artificial intelligence system.  Hundreds of millions of dollars - for the sake of buyers never faced with a stale product. <a name="habracut"></a></p><br><p>  New test supermarket company calls Intelligent Retail Lab (abbreviated - IRL).  Here is a very rich assortment: IRL sells 30,000 products.  The space is also quite large: 4,500 square meters, much larger than the average supermarket.  At the same time, only 100 employees work in such a mall (cashiers, security guards and shelves).  This is one of the main advantages of IRL: the human factor is minimal here. </p><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/v0/px/-b/v0px-bpdkosswwslsbcgbdtre1o.jpeg"><br><br><p>  Like the <a href="https://habr.com/ru/company/pochtoy/blog/374201/">Amazon Go Go</a> Cashless, the store is littered with a mass of cameras mounted into the ceiling.  But the area here is ten times larger, and the tasks of the store are different.  AI in the cameras is not configured to identify the goods that buyers take in their hands, but to track stocks of goods on the shelves.  The store sees it scatter like pies today, and can give a signal to send a person to fill a shelf.  Also, artificial intelligence takes into account the shelf life of goods and remembers how long he saw one or another object sitting on the shelf.  When the shelf life of the product comes to an end - again, the system lets the staff know.  And IRL can do this even for meat and vegetables, the shelf life of which is not prescribed for them. </p><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/l_/7e/wr/l_7ewrgx2hd1mhhcu2rfchfsooa.jpeg">

    <img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/n6/jh/tv/n6jhtvyo3jw1narebxm5ypnvmlo.jpeg"><br><br><p>  As a result, even a few dozen employees, receiving instructions from the AI, can maintain the entire huge supermarket in perfect condition.  They always know which shelf to go to.  Customers, according to Walmart, will appreciate the fact that the products are always fresh here, plus people can pay significantly less.  The company assures that it is also a great solution for its workforce: instead of constantly being on its feet, running between the shelves and checking what is missing, now they will know in advance what they need to carry. </p><br><p>  Machine vision in IRL can do everything the same as in Amazon Go.  The computer sees that the product is on the shelf, distinguishes its quantity, checks the speed with which it leaves, makes projections (is it enough for the rest of the day?).  Cameras and other store sensors generate 1.6 TB of data per second.  To analyze this amount of information, in the same room is a data center with 100 servers.  It is protected by glass, highlighted in blue and exposed to the public. </p><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/fj/nh/0f/fjnh0frad_fhtwvbvrwlqqzkccs.jpeg"><br><br><p>  To avoid accusations of violating the privacy of customers, Walmart says, all the video accumulated by the cameras is deleted after a week, and the system does not see any people at all (instead of them - a blur). </p><br><p>  The store also tests a host of other technologies.  Information terminals at the shelves help customers find out about the products they buy here (where they are released, what they contain, what recipes they use ...).  At the entrance to the store there are pedestals where you can read about the features of IRL and get answers to many common questions.  There is an interactive wall that shows your ‚Äúshadow‚Äù when you walk past it (in fact, it‚Äôs an AI that reads your camera image and predicts where you will go next.)  And the floor in the room is washed by special <a href="https://habr.com/ru/company/pochtoy/blog/432332/">cleaning robots</a> , also with the support of artificial intelligence. </p><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/7s/ud/ud/7sudud9-da4ddmowuq9rf8wzx78.jpeg"><br><br><p>  For several years, Walmart top management has been trying to surpass (or at least catch up) Amazon in everything.  Previously, they reworked their entire <a href="https://www.walmart.com/">online store</a> - and now in the last year it has become the third most popular in the States, after Amazon and eBay (and we also see that from Russia through us they began to order on it much more often, it is already in the top 5 ).  In India, interrupting the Amazon bid, Walmart <a href="https://habr.com/ru/company/pochtoy/blog/411947/">paid</a> $ 15 billion for Flipkart last year. Instead, AWS <a href="https://habr.com/ru/company/pochtoy/blog/417579/">signed a</a> contract with Microsoft Azure.  And now - here, instead of Amazon Go, they are trying to implement IRL stores. </p><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/pz/ck/i_/pzcki_nczcahcnao07vtg9lamam.jpeg"><br><br><p>  The success of the first test sample will determine whether they will open the same supermarkets in other cities and states.  Walmart first checks the willingness of customers to such new technologies.  If the IRL with its screens, cameras, and the ubiquitous AI scares off moms and grandmothers with carts, and shows sales lower than the same store six months before, Walmart will send its efforts and money to another place - good, ideas in its technology incubator <a href="https://www.storeno8.com/">8</a> ) enough. </p><br><p>  Mike Hanrahan, CEO of IRL stores, in his responses to journalists gives secretive podnachki Bezos and his Amazon Go, talking about their excessive ambition: </p><br><blockquote>  No need to be overly in love with the idea of ‚Äã‚ÄãAI.  If the technology is there, it is not necessary that it is suitable for your situation.  There are many unrealistic projects that can not scale, and, most importantly, will not be useful for buyers. <br><br>  We may be all the more prosaic, but you can be sure that the store will always have fresh fruit and meat, so your shopping trip is guaranteed to be successful, and it is worth a lot. <br></blockquote><br> <a href="http://bit.ly/PochtoyHABR"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/8s/l3/3d/8sl33dtn9xrykvzid2enikzqcfq.jpeg"></a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/450240/">https://habr.com/ru/post/450240/</a></p>
