  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Clip2net - very fast web posting</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  I want to tell the <a href="http://clip2net.com/">respected</a> public about <a href="http://clip2net.com/">Clip2Net</a> - a service for quick publication of images (and not only).  The purpose of this message is not so much the advertisement of the service as such, but rather the opportunity to openly discuss this project, its current status and possible development.  Brief information about this service has already run through sometime on Habr√©, but I think it will be interesting to learn some details, so to speak, from the first person. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b>Instead of the preface.</b>  <b>What is Clip2net.</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/7a5/fae/685/7a5fae6856ee2bb05760d6c7656953a7.jpg" width="217" height="215" alt="Clip2net" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="right"><br>  Clip2net is a tool for downloading information to the network with an emphasis on publishing an image from a computer screen.  The main point is speed, minimum operations, versatility of application.  At the output, the program provides a link to published information that can be used anywhere on the web - be it email / IM messages or your blog / website. <br>  The main functionality can be represented here by such a list of ‚Äúfeatures‚Äù: <br><ul><li>  Selecting a screen area for saving or publishing an image on the Internet </li><li>  Record video from the screen </li><li>  Publishing text documents / notes </li><li>  Upload images from the clipboard </li><li>  Publish arbitrary files from the clipboard </li><li>  Publish multiple files at once (published as a zip archive) </li><li>  Publish by dragging the selected files to a special drop-zone of the screen </li><li>  Preview of downloadable image / video / text / files </li><li>  Built-in visual text editor </li><li>  Automatically convert and watch downloaded videos </li><li>  View and organize downloaded data </li><li>  Publish data to public folders </li><li>  Adding comments to published data </li><li>  Publishing files from the browser (without installing the client application) </li><li>  Publish files by email </li><li>  API for ‚Äúnotification‚Äù of third-party systems about published information </li></ul><br>  The service is absolutely free, but with some restrictions. <br><ol><li>  Unregistered users can only post images. </li><li>  Registered users get 500Mb to store files </li><li>  There is a limit on the use of traffic - 500Mb / day per user. </li></ol><br>  <b>Part one.</b>  <b>I have an idea?</b>  <b>Look for a solution!</b>  <b>(or do it yourself)</b> <br>  The project is based on solving a problem, which was spent a lot of time every day - screen captures and publishing them on the Internet.  Our studio is engaged in the development of websites and the ‚Äúvisual‚Äù presentation of the subject of discussion when communicating with customers is not a sign of good service, but an urgent need.  That is why the task appeared - how to speed up / simplify the process of inserting images when working with a web-based project management system and communicating with clients through various IM-systems.  I wanted to get the link to the image from the screen as quickly as possible, without using FTP and without opening unnecessary browser windows. <br>  Maybe I was looking badly, but I did not find a solution that would completely satisfy me.  What was found, or solved only part of the problem, or was too cumbersome for my tasks. <br>  Thus, having collected the residual knowledge on the development of desktop applications, which I didn‚Äôt use for several years since I graduated from the institute, as well as using the Google search string, a prototype was made that, having a rather dumb look, solved the set the problem that it was decided to develop the idea and make the world a better, on its basis, public service.  Thus, the project was born Clip2net. <br>  <b>Part two.</b>  <b>About how we noticed.</b> <br>  At the beginning, Clip2net had a very modest functionality, but we couldn‚Äôt even talk about the appearance of the web part (heh ... ‚Äúshoemaker without shoes‚Äù - as we think).  But the idea worked and the reviews gave an additional incentive to develop this project.  I was somewhat puzzled by the release of the <a href="http://jingproject.com/">Jing</a> application, which was released a few days after we were sharing the working Clip2net prototype in a narrow circle, but self-confidently deciding that they wouldn‚Äôt stop them from competing too much, they didn‚Äôt leave their venture, all the more so because there were ideas that allowed uniqueness in our service. <br>  More or less putting in order the functionality and appearance, we decided that it was possible to show people.  Perhaps now I would say that the first premiere was too raw, but in the beginning I really wanted to get as many responses as possible in order to move in the right direction.  The service was originally made in two languages, so we decided to ask the opinion of foreign users.  How?  Well, simply by sending letters to several online publications with an invitation to get acquainted, and if they find the service interesting, we would be glad if they share the find with their readers.  Thus was received the first professional and, frankly, very flattering feedback from <a href="http://www.webware.com/8301-1_109-9777386-2.html">Webware</a> .  Since then, the project went for a walk on the web and appeared in some reputable publications and popular blogs.  I was able to make sure that the idea is still in demand, despite the abundance around the ‚Äúweb-two-full‚Äù services of a similar (but not quite that) sense. <br>  <b>Part Three</b>  <b>Startup?</b>  <b>Monetization?</b>  <b>Then what!?</b> <br>  And here I would start a discussion.  There is a service that seems to be in demand and quite unique.  Even, I would say, quite famous in a certain niche (instant-share).  There is a desire to develop it, but there is no model that could adequately support this development.  From the very beginning, the service was treated not as a commercial product, but rather as a hobby of one person, but it seemed like the service was needed by many, and even translated into several languages ‚Äã‚Äãon the initiative and with the help of the users themselves.  Therefore, sometimes you have to think - and then what?  Well, well, with my imagination, I have more or less everything is in order, new useful opportunities to invent and implement, while maintaining the philosophy of simplicity of the process, are not a problem.  Users also sometimes set up puzzles with their own unique configurations, so you don‚Äôt have to be bored.  It‚Äôs good to do cross-platform, also for the future.  It‚Äôs all in me that the developer says - the service has proven itself as an experimental platform for testing certain technological methods.  But if we talk about long-term prospects?  After all, the user base is growing, the costs of support and hosting increase accordingly. <br>  Ultimately, the goal is to find a reasonable compromise between the desire of (spoiled) users to get everything, immediately and free of charge, and the real costs that we bear on our own initiative. <br>  On this I want to complete my story.  I look forward to the comments of the community. <br>  PS traffic for images posted via Clip2net on Habr√© does not count :) <br><br></div>
