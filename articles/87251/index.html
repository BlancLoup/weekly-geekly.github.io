  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Golden Engine Award</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Less than two weeks left before the announcement of the Golden Engine Award results.  This year, it turned out that four out of eighteen applications in the nomination ‚ÄúBest Website‚Äù are projects made in our studio.  That is almost a quarter. <br>  This fact came as a surprise to us.  I will not hide, a pleasant surprise. <br>  We have never applied for a single award.  And this time for us (and even without our knowledge) our favorite clients did it. <br><br>  Now I would like to tell a little about each project, to finally popiaritsya here (this is generally the first post on Habr√©), and, perhaps, put a little pressure on the respected jury of the ‚ÄúGolden Engine‚Äù. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  First of all, I would like to note that recently (about four years already) we strongly recommend that our customers who decide to make a promotional website (in this case, a promotional website for a movie or a series), should not be limited to the standard ‚Äúactors - creators - trailer - photos - synopsis ".  If the film disposes to some kind of dialogue with the viewer, especially if it is a fiction film, then you should think about how to engage the site visitor in the site‚Äôs atmosphere (and, consequently, the film), make it spend more time on the site than the one relegated to a fluent reading of synopsis and;  accordingly, make it so that he - the site visitor - is more likely to be converted into a cinema visitor.  Usually we do this with the help of gaming services integrated into the site.  However, there are exceptions.  But, since the article is not about this, then about exceptions, if anyone is interested, I will tell in the comments. <br>  So, about the nominees. <br><br>  1. <a href="http://www.zdvizhok.ru/movie_107.html">"Love is not what it seems</a> . <a href="http://www.zdvizhok.ru/movie_107.html">"</a> <br>  Task: Make a non-standard website of the series, with the opportunity for dating and chatting. <br>  The result: a light, joyful website with the ability to upload your own video, each registered user has their own profile, with the possibility of simply rating each video, with ‚Äúleaders‚Äù and ‚Äúbeginners‚Äù.  The series has already ended, and the site is still alive.

      2. <a href="http://www.zdvizhok.ru/movie_138.html">"Love-Carrot 2"</a> . <br>  This is our pride, our love, our pain.  The customer did not ask for anything, did not set the conditions.  We ourselves offered to make a website, which in itself is one big game.  You can watch the trailer, or you can play with toys, changing places with the heroes of the film, looking at the adult world with children's eyes (in general, this is what this film seemed to us about).  At the same time, the presence of the game moment in the site does not in any way cancel the presence of the standard sections mentioned above.  For the successful completion of the game quest (a separate section for girls, a separate - for boys), a site visitor gets access to "secret materials". <br>  After the launch of the site, we received a call from a large Moscow newspaper and said that the work in the editorial office had risen.  Everyone is trying to pass the quest. <br>  Just to promote the film was made a few more games that existed independently from the site.  All games were branded and spread virally through the blogosphere and social networks. <br><br>  3. <a href="http://www.zdvizhok.ru/movie_141.html">"Unforgiven</a> . <a href="http://www.zdvizhok.ru/movie_141.html">"</a>  A great film by a young director Klim Shypenko. <br>  Objective: limited to a small budget, to come up with something that would ‚Äúcling‚Äù to the visitor. <br>  And so it happened: the site itself is simple, but ‚Äúterribly cute.‚Äù  As a "hook", it was decided to make an Easter egg, which was virally distributed throughout the blogosphere.  Here is the egg: from the heroes of the film, select Lex (bald, in a white shirt).  We click on it, and then - twice on the plate that appears with its characteristics.  And in the same design as the site, we get a first-person shooter toy.  Viral spread is not let down.  During the rental period, the site was visited by the planned number of users. <br><br>  4. <a href="http://www.zdvizhok.ru/movie_139.html">"Yulenka</a> . <a href="http://www.zdvizhok.ru/movie_139.html">"</a>  Choir from producer Renat Davletyarov. <br>  Task: make scary. <br>  We didn‚Äôt do any integrated entertainment.  Several locations from the film were made, in which the visitor ‚Äútravels‚Äù, switching between sections of the site.  We tried to immerse the future viewer into the atmosphere of the film as much as possible.  Hope we managed it.  Pay attention to the invisible hand, which ominously hangs pictures for development in a dark room with a red lamp.  Here are the advantages of the pre-digital era!  It is unlikely that we were able to draw and flush the ominous appearance of a photo from a printer or disturbing editing it in lightroom with the help of chilling presets. <br>  In addition to the site, several ‚Äúautonomous‚Äù satellite projects were created, designed to support the film and the site ‚Äî these are toys, on-line tests, and so on.  All of them were distributed through the blogosphere and social networks. <br><br>  All customers were satisfied.  Well, at least they were satisfied with the sites. <br>  I tried very hard to describe these four nominees for the title of ‚Äúbest film site‚Äù as short as possible, since I can talk for hours about each project - we all love our work here very much. <br>  And yes.  I completely forgot.  I'm PR. <br>  We are called <a href="http://www.web-soft.ru/">Web Soft LLC</a> . <br>  Otherwise, nothing is written about us on the award website. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/87251/">https://habr.com/ru/post/87251/</a></p>
