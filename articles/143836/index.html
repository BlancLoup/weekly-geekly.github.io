  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The first meeting of Microsoft .NET User Group in Gomel - the first pancake is not a lump :)</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  On April 21, the first <a href="http://vk.com/msuggomel">Microsoft .NET User Group</a> meeting was held <a href="http://vk.com/msuggomel">in Gomel</a> .  <a href="http://www.gstu.by/university">University.</a>  <a href="http://www.gstu.by/university">BY.</a>  <a href="http://www.gstu.by/university">Sukhoi was</a> cordially received within his walls by a group of like-minded people, eager to share their knowledge and learn something new themselves. <br><br>  The event was organized by the Gomel branch of Rus Wizards.  However, the speakers at the first conference were all from this company.  We could not miss the opportunity to become the first organizers of the .NET User Group meeting in Gomel :) <br><br>  We turn directly to the reports themselves.  The country needs to know its heroes, so I cannot fail to list the names of the pioneers in Gomel: <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/divermak/">Artyom Yermakov</a> , <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/iiiypik/">Alexander Mostovtsov</a> , <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/alexbel83/">Alexander Morozko</a> , Dmitry Lopunov and Alexander Kopachev.  Maria Semenkova became the technical organizer of this meeting.

    <a name="habracut"></a><br>  Topics for presentations: <br><ul><li>  - Web application development using Open Data Protocol; </li><li>  - Web application development using ASP.NET MVC3; </li><li>  - Web application development using ASP.NET WebForms; </li><li>  - What's new in .NET 4.5 for web developers; </li><li>  - Development of Windows Phone applications. </li></ul><br>  As you can see, the reports were quite diverse and affected various development technologies.  The speakers themselves prepared themselves seriously for this case: not only theory was presented to the audience, but many examples and demonstrations were shown for clarity. <br>  At the first meeting gathered about 50 people.  The bulk of the students.  In my opinion, this is a good sign: the interest of young professionals cannot but rejoice.  There were also experienced developers from other IT companies.  And this is also excellent - a constructive dialogue with people who know the specifics and pitfalls helps to understand the task much faster and answer questions that have not yet been asked. <br><br>  Between reports, a coffee break was organized, where it was possible to discuss all the issues in a relaxed atmosphere. <br><br>  The courage to be the first organizers of the .NET User Group meeting in Gomel is justified.  It is obvious that the interest in this area is large, people want to develop and improve their skills.  Immediately after the meeting, applications were received for the preparation of reports for the next meeting, moreover, from both novice developers and those already ‚Äúhardened‚Äù.  And the next meeting is just around the corner.  No less interesting reports are expected, and the number of participants will increase significantly. <br>  Well, from all this we can conclude that the first pancake did not come out lumpy.  All minor flaws were analyzed, all achievements are noted as a good example.  Many thanks to all participants, and we are waiting for all interested parties next time! <br><br>  And if those who attended the event read us at Habr√©, your feedback is welcome! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/143836/">https://habr.com/ru/post/143836/</a></p>
