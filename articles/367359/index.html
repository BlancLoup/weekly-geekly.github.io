  <section class="page js-page"><h1>"In the bent!" Or the advantages and disadvantages of curved TVs</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Three years - about as much marketing incubation was needed in order for the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãcurved TVs from the news tapes of technical publications to be embodied in the form of an autonomous product segment.  During this time, transcendental prices for curved panels have dropped to reasonable (but still considerable) amounts, and manufacturers began to promise full involvement, unprecedented realism of the picture and a flat stomach in exchange for abandoning flat-panel TVs. <br><br> <a href="http://geektimes.ru/company/mvideo/blog/251808/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/185/e0d/0d0/185e0d0d0c9e4bfab30b4feaad0dddb9.jpg"></a> <br><br>  The tendency to curvature of the screens could be called the purest evolution, such as the parallel implementation of 4K.  However, if the merits of improving resolution are extremely clear without explanation, in the case of curved displays, one often has to be guided by marketing texts only.  As part of this post, we will try to analyze how manufacturers are honest with consumers, talking about the merits of this product segment. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  <font color="#ec2028">Curved means big</font> </h2><br>  The technology of curved panels was originally presented inextricably with large diagonals, which automatically classifies this type of TVs and monitors in the entertainment niche.  In fact, the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãchanging the radius of the canvas for demonstrations was born a long time ago: first in theatrical business, and then safely moved into cinema to increase the panorama.  Now curved screens are universally used in cinemas and in IMAX in particular.

      By the way, the example of IMAX in promoting the first models of curved TVs served as an excellent starting point for explaining the merits.  Following the relationship of curvature, concave displays supposedly allow you to achieve a similar immersion in what is happening no worse than in every detail thought-out movie theater.  In fact, the curved canvas in IMAX is almost least of all responsible for the ‚Äúpresence effect‚Äù, since this form allows us to solve a number of technical nuances associated with the propagation of light and the operation of the projector.  At the same time, immersion is achieved by bending the screen together with its huge dimensions, which do not allow embracing the entire width with a look. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/200/0b9/89c/2000b989c64a40308f7a3e0a3748cb45.jpg"><br><br>  Considering all the above, immersion, similar to the well-known cinematic system, is real and at home, but taking into account the fact that the TV will literally ‚Äúembrace‚Äù the viewer.  This can be <a href="http://www.mvideo.ru/products/televizor-samsung-ultra-hd-ue78js9500t-10007815">achieved</a> by ruining a model such as the <a href="http://www.mvideo.ru/products/televizor-samsung-ultra-hd-ue78js9500t-10007815">Samsung UE78JS9500,</a> or in a more budgetary way - sit closer to the TV with a smaller diagonal. <br><br>  At the same time, there are no exact recommendations for determining the optimal distance to the TV for ‚Äúimmersion‚Äù.  Moreover, if watching a spectacular movie in high resolution, such a method, together with a curved TV model, will be partially justified, then the broadcast of news in such a format risks turning into a demonstration of panoramic figures of politicians right in the living room.  Therefore, it is better to think here about the ophthalmological ecology and the problem of perception by eyes of a curved image, discarding the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãimmersion. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/11c/017/ffe/11c017ffea3a4c28ad9c0419a264ac75.jpg"><br><br>  Scientists have been exploring the mechanisms of vision for several centuries.  Thus, the concept of ‚Äúhoropter‚Äù was introduced - a certain conditional surface in the field of view in the form of a circle, which includes a set of points of space.  These points are projected on identical points of the retina of different eyes (corresponding points) and give a complete image.  If the conditions of correspondence are violated by the perception of different points (outside the horopter), then this may cause double images.  In general, the topic is extremely interesting, difficult to understand and is somewhere at the intersection of the spheres of psychology of perception and ophthalmology.  However, it is these theories that are implied by manufacturers when it comes to the fact that the eyes perceive curved images better.  TV at the same time must be set at such a distance that the viewing angle allows you to "capture" the picture from the screen completely.  Only in this case, the side points located at the edges of the right and left parts of the screen, as well as the center point between them, will have an equal distance from the viewer's eyes.  In this case, the only correct position of the viewer for the use of such a science is exactly in the middle of the TV.  However, more on that later. <br><br>  As for the recommendations for the last example, there are many theories and methods for determining the optimal distance to the TV.  Instructions from <a href="http://www.thx.com/consumer/home-entertainment/home-theater/hdtv-set-up/">THX</a> have long become authoritative and, importantly, extremely suitable for our case.  In the network there are a huge number of different <a href="http://www.engineeringcalculator.net/home-theater-calculator.html">calculators</a> for calculating the distance, which are based on these recommendations.  In accordance with them, for comfortable viewing, the TV should occupy 36-40 degrees of viewing angle.  At the same time, which is quite logical, the distance changes depending on the resolution of the model.  For example, from 55-inch screens (as an option - <a href="http://www.mvideo.ru/products/televizor-lg-ultra-hd-55uc970v-10006736">LG Ultra HD 55UC970V</a> ) will have to retire by about 3 meters. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/2b9/282/b96/2b9282b962ae48dabbb142040d9c8cf0.jpg" align="left">  At the same time, there are prerequisites for the appearance on the market of curved monitors much less overall diagonals.  Thus, according to one <a href="http://www.researchgate.net/publication/275035987_Do_Curved_Displays_Make_for_a_More_Pleasant_Experiencecurved_displays_make_for_a_more_pleasant_experience">study</a> , different types of information on a curved screen are perceived better than on a flat one. <br><br>  First, a prototype of a monitor model was developed, the radius of curvature of which can be changed with the help of a simple design.  Instead of modern displays, however, we had to limit ourselves to a sheet of paper with interchangeable images. <br><br>  The result was a 23-inch ‚Äúmonitor‚Äù with a 16: 9 aspect ratio, on which the subjects first selected the optimal curvature radius of the web, and then alternately with a flat screen configuration, they tried to perceive different information.  The conclusions of the experience can be found with a small table, where the results of measurements of the time of reading the same text on a flat and curved display are shown.  According to them, the curved shape allows you to quickly master the material, which is quite possibly related to the theory of the horopter line described above. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/a22/fa2/e73/a22fa2e7388d4ef40cb2d0730a61a773.jpg"><br><br><h2>  <font color="#ec2028">Default condition</font> </h2><br>  Let us return to the promised theme of the correct position.  Studying the promotional materials for various curved TVs, you can see that the viewers depicted are sitting right in the middle of the TV.  Such a position, coupled with the correctly chosen distance, will allow you to get all the benefits of a curved display.  If on this TV you want to make a family viewing of the film, then many will remain deprived of technological buns.  However, this has its advantages: according to the illustrations from LG, the curved panels bring together. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/ca2/9ae/dfe/ca29aedfec83a2162428076c8f3bd643.jpg"><br><br>  Finally, the curved shape of the display, according to a marketing legend, is able to visually increase the screen area.  And in fact there is some truth in this.  Since the actual width of the panel decreases due to the radius of curvature along the entire panel, we can see more exactly as far as the display is bent in the corners.  Moreover, the visual indicator will vary depending on the distance of the viewer.  But it is worth changing the ideal position in front of the monitor, as all the magic becomes irrelevant. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/9de/c96/cd6/9dec96cd634b9e94349fb0e746bf43ea.jpg"><br><br>  A roughly similar situation arises with the view that the curved shape allows for increased contrast on the sides.  Universally answer this question will not work, if only because manufacturers use different matrices. However, even if the form compensates for blackouts, then for one viewer who will sit in the center in front of the screen.  The rest of the audience, by contrast, can observe the distortion of the picture. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#ec2028">Instead of output</font> </h2><br>  Curved panels are a relatively new phenomenon and it is still difficult to say for sure whether there is a future for them or not.  For family viewing, this may not be the best option, since the curvature implies a certain area for comfortable viewing.  But a curved monitor (such as the <a href="http://www.mvideo.ru/products/monitor-samsung-s34e790c-30021668">Samsung S34E790C</a> , which <a href="http://geektimes.ru/users/boomburum/" class="user_link">Boomburum was</a> <a href="http://geektimes.ru/company/mvideo/blog/249004/">talking</a> <a href="http://geektimes.ru/users/boomburum/" class="user_link">about</a> ), in front of which one person will be sitting in the center is another matter.
