  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Darth Vader's voice</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The most terrible villain of cinema history only in the six main films of the saga were played by 6 different people: Jake Lloyd was Anakin as a child, while Hayden Christensen portrayed the dark side of power, David Proze dragged a few kilograms of armor on the set in New Hope.  The quality of the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3D8kpHK4YIwY4">lightsaber battle in the first film</a> left much to be desired, so in the next two episodes the bodybuilder in the battle scenes was replaced by professional fencer Bob Anderson.  Finally, Vader without a mask and a helmet played Sebastian Shaw, he was the spirit of Anakin after the death of the latter.  Later, with the development of computer-mounted technologies, the head of the spirit was <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DXkDO2UxX4Lo">changed to Christensen's head looking somewhere in the direction</a> . <br><br>  But he was voiced by the two-meter Sith / Sith lord James Earl Jones, who was not distinguished by sufficient physical data, his height was only 187 cm. Why did this happen?  The fact is that Prouse had a rather fearless so-called <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2590%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B3%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B9%25D1%2581%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B9_%25D1%258F%25D0%25B7%25D1%258B%25D0%25BA_%25D0%25A3%25D1%258D%25D1%2581%25D1%2582-%25D0%259A%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BD%25D1%2582%25D1%2580%25D0%25B8">West Country native accent</a> (counties south-west of London) and a too high voice. <br><br>  It is difficult to surprise someone with this story, but not everyone knows how it sounded on the set.  In the next video you can hear the voice of an English athlete as he sounded on the set, and make sure of the miscasting.  Prose pronounces Vader's lines at 00:10 and 00:27.  James Earl Jones speaks at 1:00, after 1:30 there is a speech by Vader from the movie.

Harrison Ford even called the athlete "collective farm Vader" (Darth Farmer) for the ridiculous inconsistency. <br><br> <a href="http://http:https:"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a31/3df/154/a313df154824449ea18b908b972e267f.jpg"></a> <br>  <em>This picture has a resolution of 1920 √ó 1200 pixels, which makes it a good background image for the desktop of most monitors</em> <br><br>  Doubts about the voice of the hero arose immediately and at all.  During the shooting of the first film, Prouz still played, because he believed that his voice would fall into Star Wars, in the following, he sometimes just made fun of it and gave the intonations of his replicas a funny shade.  But when the bucket on your head is so big that it even dangles without any special refinement, it is strange to expect that your voice will fall into the soundtrack of the film. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/8b5/dee/5c6/8b5dee5c64e04cad8c03563d9c093daa.jpeg" align="right">  Vader's voice was decided to give a ‚Äúdark‚Äù - not skin color, but in the sense of timbre - a shade.  To do this, they found an actor who was born and grew up in the Mississippi River area and matured in Michigan, so that his pronunciation suited the role much better.  James Earl Jones did not play the voice of the former Anakin, but the synthesizer‚Äôs speech synthesizer; without him, Vader could only whisper.  By the way, the famous breath sound <a href="https://tsdr.uspto.gov/documentviewer%3FcaseId%3Dsn77419252%26docId%3DMRK20090309160326">is a</a> protected trademark. <br><br>  The promise was also promised that Vader without a mask would have his face and speak with his voice.  This also did not happen, probably because the athlete was only 40 with a tail.  And for good reason: David Prose is a bit like an older version of Christensen. <br><br>  Poor Prose after the premiere of The Empire Strikes Back did not even know what Darth Vader actually said at the end of the duel.  On the set there was a cover version that Obi-Wan Kenobi killed father Luke Skywalker.  Only a few people knew about the real plot twist before the premiere.  Prose himself said that if he knew, he would have played differently. <br><br>  But there was a very important reason for this: his inability to keep his mouth shut.  This is true: <a href="">in 1978 he managed to give the plot to the end of the trilogy to a crowd of fans</a> .  In the end, in 2010, Lucas <a href="http://www.digitalspy.com/movies/news/a246015/prowse-banned-from-star-wars-events.html">forbade</a> him to appear at all official Star Wars festivals. <br><br>  Even decades later, the bodybuilder manages to slander nonsense, for example, about positive discrimination, which led to the replacement of his voice - there were no black characters in the film.  Of course, this is not at all the case: in the credits of the first African-American film James Earl Jones was not at all, since he believed that the dubbing was not enough for recognition.  The general public, the real face of the main villain's voice was unknown for a long time.  Today, Jones does not even sign autographs. <br><br>  It may seem that Vader‚Äôs voice was offended: they paid the actor for ‚ÄúNew Hope‚Äù only 7 thousand dollars.  However, <a href="http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/%3Fi%3D%25247000%2Bin%2B1977%2Btoday">in view of inflation, it is $ 27,430</a> .  Darth Vader doesn‚Äôt have many replicas, especially in the first film, and in 1977 James Earl Jones spent one working day in the recording studio.  He did not even appear on the set.  To this day, the ‚Äúvoice‚Äù and the ‚Äúbody‚Äù have not seen or met each other. <br><br>  Based on <a href="http://io9.com/5684916/in-1978-darth-vaders-actor-spoiled-the-empire-strikes-backs-ending-to-a-local-newspaper/">io9</a> , <a href="http://starwars.wikia.com/">Wuki</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/">Wikipedia</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/362775/">https://habr.com/ru/post/362775/</a></p>
