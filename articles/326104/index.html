No buildings, structures - only cleared and enclosed field for our mega-project.  Then it was still difficult to imagine that in a few months everything would “boil and seethe” here, and later a beautiful, large data center would grow. </p><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/795/33b/5b7/79533b5b761144f7aaab76d798374062.jpg"><br><p>  <em>Development of a cold center pit.</em>  <em>The first bucket February 11, 2015</em> </p><br><p>  From <strong>February to March 2015,</strong> we moved closer and closer to the “center of the Earth”.

This event marked the transition to a new stage of construction - interior decoration!  Fire doors with an anti-panic system and with a design providing no threshold will be installed in the data center building.  All doors in the building are equipped with access control system. </p><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d70/f6b/361/d70f6b36144a49f79d7a23d98a6e9cf0.jpg"><br><p>  <em>In the photo: the first door installed in the data center "Avantage"</em> </p><br><h2 id="ustanovka-oborudovaniya">  Equipment installation </h2><br><p> <strong>The first type of equipment</strong> , the installation of which began <strong>in May 2016</strong> , became <strong>Tecofi butterfly valves (France)</strong> .  The cooling system of the data center involves the use of 18 dry coolers, 9 chillers and 128 precision air conditioners.  In the period from June 1 to June 3, 2016, the first batch of main process equipment was delivered to the construction site of the Avantage data center.  It consists of <strong>5 sets of diesel-rotary uninterruptible power supplies</strong> and <strong>16 ventilation units manufactured by Euroclima</strong> , designed for installation in the <strong>power</strong> center.  All equipment was installed immediately on the designated project site.  In total, according to the project, installation of 14 diesel-rotary uninterruptible power supplies with a capacity of 1,650 kVA each is provided for in the building of the power center.  They are designed to provide uninterrupted power supply of the entire data center complex. </p><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/fb5/6d0/a13/fb56d0a13b2b457b895d58533e6f72c5.jpeg"><br><p>  <em>In the photo: top left - the first butterfly valves in the cooling system of the data center, top right and bottom - delivery and installation of diesel-rotor uninterruptible power supplies</em> </p><br><p>  In <strong>July 2016,</strong> 6 plate heat exchangers manufactured by Alfa Laval Potok and 6 refrigerating machines (chillers) manufactured by Cofely (Germany) arrived at the construction site.  The devices were installed at the design sites, work was carried out on their piping.  A total of <strong>9 plate heat exchangers are</strong> installed in the data center, each of which will provide a heat sink of 1600 kW.  Plate heat exchangers are used to remove heat in free cooling mode (freecooling).  For the cold supply during the summer period, chillers of the internal installation with a liquid cooled condenser with centrifugal compressors Turbocore are used.  The total power of the excess heat given off by the data center cooling system will be 11.5 MW. </p><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/1f7/f84/bad/1f7f84badbd0410ca1f0542cb2cb6ff4.jpeg"><br><p>  <em>In the photo: installation of heat exchangers (left) and chillers (right)</em> </p><br><p>  Meanwhile, <strong>by the end of the summer,</strong> outside the data center already looks quite ready, although it can be seen that it is on the “battlefield” (photo below), and inside it is the “cutting” of IT space. </p><br><p>  Under the placement of IT equipment in Avantage, <strong>16 server rooms are</strong> allocated, located on 2 floors, with 8 server rooms per floor.  Each server room has dimensions of 13.1 x 30.2 m (S = 396 sq.m), height (from the floor to the ceiling) 5.0 m and can accommodate <strong>140 server cabinets</strong> 800x1200 mm in size.  The server rooms will be equipped with a raised floor with a height of 1000 mm to ensure the supply of cooled air.  In 13 server rooms of 16 precision air conditioners to prevent service personnel from accessing rooms with IT equipment, they will be installed outside the server rooms in dedicated, technological corridors. </p><br><p>  The air conditioning of the server rooms is designed to remove excess heat in the amount of 735 kW to the server room and maintain the temperature of the cooling air at +24 ° C.  The power supply of the server rooms will be carried out on 2-line trunk lines of 1600 A. The halls will be equipped with aspiration fire detection and gas fire extinguishing systems. </p><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/1af/e62/db9/1afe62db91bd481ab2fa01836f897992.jpeg"><br><p>  <em>In the photo: view of the data center "Avantage" outside (top) and inside while cutting IT space by the end of the summer of 2016 (bottom)</em> </p><br><p>  <strong>In early autumn</strong> , delivery and installation of <strong>10 kV switchgear equipment</strong> and <strong>power transformers manufactured by Siemens</strong> (picture below) began on the construction site.  In total, the project provides for the installation of 112 10 kV cells combined into 11 sections and the 41st 10 / 0.4 kV power transformer.  To create a 10 kV switchgear of the Avantage data center, 10 kV cells of the NXair, Simosec and 8DJH series are used.  The power supply system of the data center - 17.3 MW. </p><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/7e2/4ac/22b/7e24ac22b2eb4b2d8fbb1ea9220184fd.jpeg"><br><p>  <em>In the photo: installation of switchgear equipment and power transformers</em> </p><br><p>  In <strong>September,</strong> we had to perform a difficult operation to lift the first batch of <strong>dry coolers produced by Cabero</strong> on the roof of the data center building.  For this, a <strong>160-ton crane</strong> was called to the construction site.  Within one day, all 8 dry coolers of the first batch were installed at the project sites.  In total, the project provides for the installation of 18 dry coolers.  In the project, Cabero dry coolers are used to remove excess heat to the atmosphere.  When the outside air temperature is below + 9C, the data center cooling system goes into direct cooling mode, which does not use refrigeration compressors. </p><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/9f1/55d/386/9f155d386e404b1494cd1be9f7fd2462.jpeg"><br><p>  <em>In the photo: the rise of the first batch of dry coolers</em> </p><br><p>  In the meantime, <strong>in October 2016,</strong> outside the data center, the front of works on <strong>landscaping the data</strong> center was opened.  In total, 7,800 square meters of driveways will have to be asphalted and 10,500 square meters of lawns will be planted.  On the territory will be organized parking for 90 cars.  I can not believe it, but there will be a garden city here! </p><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/616/e38/abf/616e38abf09e44209c25932291370f5a.jpeg"><br><p>  <em>In the photo: landscaping the data center "Avantage"</em> </p><br><p>  By <strong>November 2016</strong>  <strong>Technair LV precision air conditioners</strong> arrived at the construction site and began to occupy project sites.  In total, the project provides for the installation of 128 precision air conditioners in server rooms and 4 in 2 cross rooms.  In each of the 16 server rooms installed on 8-m conditioners.  Air conditioners have a cooling capacity of 105 kW each and are reserved according to the N + 1 scheme.  As a result, each hardware room has the potential of removing excess heat of 735 kW. </p><br><p>  At the same time, cable galleries, premises and installed equipment are ready for laying 10 kV switchgear cable lines.  <strong>Cable lines of 10 kV</strong> inside the complex of data center buildings will interconnect 112 cells combined in 11 sections and 41 power transformers, organizing an uninterrupted and guaranteed 18 MW power supply source together with diesel rotary UPSs. </p><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/716/b38/ea2/716b38ea27064ce5b1a08e03b5d19a14.jpeg"><br><p>  <em>In the photo: precision air conditioners (above) and the future cable gallery (below)</em> </p><br><p>  In <strong>December 2016,</strong> the installation of raised floors began in the data center.  Total installed <strong>9300 sq.m.</strong>  <strong>raised floors</strong> .  6400 square meters - in the server rooms, the rest - in the corridors and technological rooms.  Uniflair spa Schneider Electric, Schneider Electric was chosen as the producer of raised floors.  In the server rooms, a raised floor with a height of 1 m is installed, the space under which serves to supply cooled air to the server equipment. </p><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/00b/965/958/00b9659587e24c718990387ba71304aa.jpeg"><br><p>  <em>In the photo: installation of raised floors</em> </p><br><p>  Well, in the end, this is how we already look <strong>from the satellite</strong> . </p><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/6e5/a88/d85/6e5a88d85e2041fbacd1b05037ad0cbf.JPG"><br><br><p>  At this point, we’ll interrupt, and the second part, with the remaining work, will be released by the time of the opening of the data center.  Plus, perhaps there will be an additional post in which we will highlight more interesting moments for you.  I ask questions in the comments. </p><br><p>  <a href="http://tadviser.ru/a/263997">Here</a> you can find out more details about the project itself. </p><br><p>  The material was prepared with the active participation of colleagues from LLC Avantazh. </p></div>
