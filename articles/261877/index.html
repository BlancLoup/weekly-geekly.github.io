We decided to help on our part and made a selection of the most interesting speeches from the <a href="http://2015.profsoux.ru/">ProfsoUX</a> conference held in St. Petersburg.  It was an event for UX designers and anyone interested in the topic of UX and Usability. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Participation in international conferences is always beneficial.  First of all, it is an opportunity to meet new people, share experiences with leading representatives of the industry, explore the subtleties of the workflow in other companies and come back with many new ideas that can be applied in their work. <br><br>  The format of the Trade Union Conference was very successful, it was possible to freely ask questions to the speakers and actively communicate with them outside the lecture halls. <br><br>  We tried to collect the most interesting, in our opinion, information on the conference reports.  We hope that the topics raised will help someone to reflect on the importance of such things as usability testing and designing letters;  Will give useful tips on designing UI, application icons and many other things.

    <h3>  Usability Testing for 10 000 rubles </h3><br>  ( <a href="http://2015.profsoux.ru/papers/96/">http://2015 .profsoux.ru/papers/96/</a> ) <br><br>  In his succinct report on usability testing, Ruslan Savvotin (LitRes) said that, firstly, usability testing should in principle be carried out, secondly, it is not as bad as it may seem, and, thirdly, such testing can be done at minimal cost and with the necessary equipment. <br><br>  Everyone knows about the huge expensive usability laboratories in which they test products entirely.  But what to do if the budget is only 10,000 rubles (for the payment of respondents, the necessary equipment and software)?  We'll have to conduct usability testing independently. <br><br>  Using the example of a service for students, the speaker said that in 48 hours you can complete a product test with 6 respondents using 2 chairs, a table, a computer, a camera and the necessary software (Open Broadcaster, OGAMA, Camtasia Studio).  First you need to find respondents on forums, in social networks and literally on the street - near universities and libraries.  In the process of testing, it is necessary to ask as many questions as possible (in addition to pre-prepared questionnaires, you can use the ‚Äúthinking out loud‚Äù method: ask the respondent to voice everything he thinks about the product and stipulate all his actions), fix everything on audio and video, then read , listen and view all the material.  Next, you need to divide all errors into three groups according to severity (high, medium and low).  The fourth group should include all that the respondent liked and turned out to be a good solution.  Well, then, based on the results, it is necessary to improve the product and continue to iteratively carry out tests for usability. <br><br>  What result will it give?  With the help of usability testing, spending only 6,000 rubles.  to pay respondents and 4 000 rubles.  on the necessary equipment and software, you check your solutions to their full implementation and do not fail the final product. <br><br>  For example, in all projects of our company, especially in those where analysts create interfaces from scratch, usability testing is required.  Sometimes customers spend it on their side and share the results.  But it is not difficult to conduct such testing on your own, and you can share the results with the customer, making it easier for him to make decisions. <br><br><h3>  7 moderator errors in usability testing </h3><br>  ( <a href="http://2015.profsoux.ru/papers/114/">http://2015 .profsoux.ru/papers/114/</a> ) <br><br>  The usability testing theme was continued by Daria Kulikova (Usethics), who spoke about the most common mistakes made by moderators and how to avoid them. <br><br>  The considered errors, it would seem, are obvious, but they occur quite often. <br><br><ul><li>  If you see that the user cannot step even without your comments and prompts, try to break the deadlock with leading questions: ‚ÄúWhat do you think?  Where would you go? ‚ÄùEtc.  It is important to remain calm and remember the purpose of testing. </li><li>  Do not try to impose your point of view on the user and do not instill in him what he allegedly wanted to do by pressing this or that button.  You need to get evidence, and moderator comments should not be included in the testing report. </li><li>  By asking closed questions, you will not get any useful result.  So if we asked such a question, specify, how exactly, where, what and what was done. </li><li>  Ask more about what the user is doing, so that it doesn‚Äôt work, what are you talking about different things? </li><li>  Do not rush the user, give him time to collect his thoughts and understand what he needs to do. </li><li>  However, in order for the testing session to be delayed, first give the respondent a plan and test the most important tasks. </li><li>  It is important to avoid using professional vocabulary that can frighten the respondent, speak the same language with him. </li></ul><br>  In fact, the speaker presented to the audience a checklist of what needs to be kept in mind during testing, so that the information received from respondents would be much more useful and help improve the product. <br><br>  In addition to usability testing, the presented tips will be used in our company as well during the internal sessions of the testtests. <br><br><h3>  In spite of the screen </h3><br>  ( <a href="http://2015.profsoux.ru/papers/86/">http://2015 .profsoux.ru/papers/86/</a> ) <br><br>  One of the best presentations of the conference, presented by Viktor Ivanov (KristallService), was devoted to building user interaction in conditions that are very different from the usual web-based or mobile interaction environments. <br><br>  The report is based on the experience of KristallService employees, obtained in the design of the interface of the self-service cashier.  In this interface, almost everything, from scanning to payment, is performed by the buyer himself.  The speaker focused on the fact that in order to get many answers, one had to study cognitive psychology. <br><br>  After conducting usability testing, the company decided to abandon voice prompts and videos, but decided to concentrate on: <br><br><ul><li>  creating clear images that clearly and intelligibly explain to the buyer what to do and how, </li><li>  focusing on significant points by ‚Äúpopping out‚Äù this information, </li><li>  using sound alerts for errors </li><li>  placing relevant information at the bottom of the screen.  This is due to the fact that the eyes of the buyer when working with the cash register are approximately at the level of the bottom of the screen. </li></ul><br>  As you can see, this was not without usability testing, which helped create a perfect self-checkout interface. <br><br>  For us, the speaker‚Äôs experience turned out to be very useful, since we are confronted in our work with various systems, and instead of walking on the same rake, we can adapt the proposed solutions for our projects. <br><br><h3>  Features of the UI design of large professional systems </h3><br>  ( <a href="http://2015.profsoux.ru/papers/91/">http://2015 .profsoux.ru/papers/91/</a> ) <br><br>  This report reveals the features and nuances of designing large professional systems in terms of user interaction. <br>  A common feature of large systems is that all of them are used to solve problems in areas of activity that could exist long before the appearance of the systems themselves (shipbuilding, medicine, etc.). <br><br>  The main features of professional systems: <br><br><ul><li>  High complexity of the subject area.  A solution to this problem is to develop a concept that allows you to solve first the problems of ergonomics, and then move on to a detailed modeling of business processes.  If you immediately begin to design interfaces, then you can not cover the entire system as a whole. </li><li>  The difference in the degree of motivation of users.  The main difficulty here is the integration of motivated and unmotivated users in one system.  It is important not to negatively relate to unmotivated users.  To love or not to love the system is their choice, and we must provide for them the opportunity to do their work.  The easiest way to solve this problem is to create a basic and expert modes. </li><li>  Specific usage contexts.  It is necessary to consider environmental conditions when working with the system.  For example, in car service it is dirty, noisy, inconvenient, there is no place to put.  How to take this into account?  Go beyond the mouse and screen, affect the hardware used. </li><li>  Efficiency above all.  Efficiency is much higher than clarity.  For example, it is hard to imagine an airplane cabin that is understandable to everyone.  And the pilot does not need it.  How to increase efficiency?  Increase reflectivity, standardize frequently used operations, control minor errors so that their succession does not cause serious consequences. </li></ul><br>  Conclusion: to be a good designer, you must not just design a hammer, but design its activities, otherwise you will get a hammer, it is not clear what you created. <br><br><h3>  We design letters on the same wavelength with the user. </h3><br>  ( <a href="http://2015.profsoux.ru/papers/88/">http://2015 .profsoux.ru/papers/88/</a> ) <br><br>  Separate attention deserves the report of Marina Titova (Onlinetours.com) on the design of letters.  Historically, the responsibility for this is shifted to marketers.  However, the speaker calls for consideration of this problem from the point of view of UX. <br><br>  User experience consists not only of direct work with the system.  Contact points are also letters and SMS sent to users, which clearly illustrates the use of Customer Journey Map (was discussed in detail in the article <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/nixsolutions/blog/257715/">The Most Interesting Reports from Analyst Days 2015</a> ).  That is why the design of all these types of messages must be treated as seriously as the design of other system functionality.  The report touched upon the topics of language, style, time of sending letters, balance of mailing frequency, AB-testing of various variations of mailings, comparing Open rate and Click rate when using different audience segmentations. <br><br>  For example, the following advice was given in the report: <br><br><ul><li>  never forget who you are writing the letter to; </li><li>  write letters on the basis of the role played by the site: if the site is a friend, write as a friend, if a consultant, write as a consultant; </li><li>  consider what stage of aggression (or non-aggression) your user is currently at.  This information will also be available after building the Customer journey map. </li></ul><br>  As a bonus, the speaker told a funny incident from her experience.  As a result of a mixture of human factors and technical errors, the thousands of user base received a letter with the content of the ‚Äútest test‚Äù, and after half an hour another one is the same.  Long thought to send back, and whether to send.  As a result, a letter was sent: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/62c/593/7ac/62c5937ac80a4048894ea3beb24ef9d4.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a55/af7/dce/a55af7dce5c24c74bf973b7bdc5eca16.png"><br><br>  Answers were sent to the letter, the audience woke up, which had never opened the letter before, some of the responses included requests for tours, many creative answers were received: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/5c5/70f/fa1/5c570ffa100a4eb2a5529c05ecd9d5b6.png"><br><br>  As a result, this newsletter had the highest Open rate. <br><br>  Conclusion: write letters with a soul! <br><br><h3>  How to get the truth from the user and the juice from the manager </h3><br>  ( <a href="http://2015.profsoux.ru/papers/87/">http://2015 .profsoux.ru/papers/87/</a> ) <br><br>  With this report, UX-specialist Mikhail Frolov tried to convey the need for usability testing of the application being developed. <br><br>  Often in work there are tense situations between developers, managers and designers, as each has its own view on the appearance and functional features of the product being developed. <br><br>  In the midst of disputes on the horizon, as a rule, a UX-specialist should appear, who in an accessible form will explain to the manager the need to remove or make some changes to the application.  However, in situations where the logic of the development team is very fragmented, usability testing is used, which allows you to identify the strengths and weaknesses of the application, as well as determine the degree of need for improvements. <br><br>  The test results are a report in which a psychological portrait of the user, a brief biography and understanding of the world are made.  Then in the form of tables presents a description of the functional features of the product, as well as reactions and customer reviews.  It should be understood that through such testing not all critical points can be identified.  It is necessary to take into account that the larger the target audience, the more should be the study.  In any case, we can say that usability testing can help you quickly and painlessly make the application a higher-quality and popular user audience, as well as harmonize teamwork. <br><br><h3>  Icons for mobile applications.  Let's do ugly! </h3><br>  ( <a href="http://2015.profsoux.ru/papers/79/">http://2015 .profsoux.ru/papers/79/</a> ) <br><br>  Andrash Gusti (Hippopotamus-Hippopotamus) told how to make the application icon more visible against the background of the variety available in the network. <br>  The simplicity of his recommendations will help to more correctly evaluate the UI in terms of the user's ability to focus on the icon of the application that we are developing. <br><br>  What spoils the icons: <br><br><ul><li>  The use of a large number of small elements in the design of icons can play a cruel joke with the application.  The icon will be lost against the rest, and the application risks to go unnoticed. </li><li>  Use of the logo.  The exceptions are large multi-user services (Twitter, Facebook). </li><li>  Use of photos. </li></ul><br>  What to do: <br><br><ul><li>  Use a unique form.  There is always the opportunity to diversify even the familiar characters.  For example, a flag that determines the location on the map. </li><li>  Limit the palette.  Recognizable colors can make an application recognizable by the general public.  If the Facebook icon was, for example, pink, then the logical relationship would be lost. </li><li>  Do not use prohibited characters.  Depending on the geographical location, it is also necessary to take into account the cultural characteristics of users. </li><li>  Maintain a logical connection with the application.  Icons should contain such elements that fit the theme of the application and the overall design concept. </li></ul><br>  It is worth noting that a properly designed icon will help ensure a better user response to the application and will give up to 30% conversion. <br><br>  There is a great way to check how well the icon was designed - usability testing. <br><br>  You can test on the development team, on fake ads, through advertising on social networks and mobile search engines.  Thus, observing all these simple rules and taking into account the comments, you can get the perfect application icon. <br><br><h3>  Design in numbers.  Increasing the number of activations of the mobile application </h3><br>  ( <a href="http://2015.profsoux.ru/papers/115/">http://2015 .profsoux.ru/papers/115/</a> ) <br><br>  The main problem of mobile applications is the low ability to activate.  Difficulties, pitfalls and ways to solve the problem were covered in sufficient detail in his report by Andrey Gevak (Yandex). <br><br>  The available data is very, very depressing.  According to statistics, the total number of mobile applications is more than 3,000,000; an average person uses about 27 applications per month.  The time spent on the use of mobile applications is about 127 minutes per day.  However, only a couple of applications can take more than 20% of the user's attention.  65% of users delete the application after three months of use, 20% open the application for the first and last time. <br><br>  Of course, all mobile application developers strive to increase revenue.  But, before approaching the monetization stage, the user goes through several stages: activation, recurrence, and only then monetization and profit. <br><br>  The speaker calls the activation how the user understands the purpose of the application, its ability to penetrate the product.  At this stage, those who could not figure out how to use the application are eliminated during the first session. <br><br>  With examples of the development of the application ‚ÄúYandex.  Music ‚Äùspeaker showed correct and erroneous decisions when we try to make the user understand the application from the first time, thereby increasing the return rate and conversion.  So, among the comments, there is the problem of creating instructions for using the application, to which no one, most often, pays attention. <br><br>  As ways to solve the problem, two options were proposed: <br><br><ul><li>  qualitative research.  Includes recording of comments and user survey.  It takes relatively little time, it is very useful because it allows you to quickly understand the flaws in the developed application; </li><li>  very time-intensive UX-research, which includes long-term monitoring of user reactions while working with the application.  Mostly designed for the long term use of the product. </li></ul><br>  Also, for better consideration of the wishes of the user, additional tools are used.  For example, the CJM (Customer Jorney Map) technique already mentioned in other reports allows you to record the details of the user's interaction with the service, as well as increase the conversion by monitoring the quantitative indicators of the use of the application. <br><br>  In general, according to the speaker, in order to increase conversion it is necessary to be able to correctly simplify the user's understanding of the complex, make clear navigation and interconnection between sections, and also simplify the authorization / registration function.  Then the application will be simple and clear to use, and the user is kind, happy and grateful. <br><br>  * * * <br><br>  If you ever ask yourself whether it is worth attending the next ProfsoUX conference, then we want to give one-to-one advice - definitely worth it! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/261877/">https://habr.com/ru/post/261877/</a></p>
