  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Sovereign: algorithm</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  "Sovereign" Machiavelli - one of my favorite works.  As a guide directly to the ruler, I believe that every director / director must read this book.  And although she is already outdated, I think it would be very useful to keep her advice in my head. <br><br>  But it can be hard.  Not only because of the amount of information, but also because, depending on the situation, Machiavelli gives different tips. <br><br>  ‚ÄúIt would be nice to structure it,‚Äù I thought. 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>
        <script>
          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      The result of thought was the decision-making algorithm presented in the picture below and created exclusively for the ‚ÄúSovereign‚Äù.  The remaining tips, which are not defined under any situation and which should be followed in any case, are listed below.  I am sure everyone will be able to extrapolate recommendations to the governor for the position of leader. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/624/5be/54a/6245be54aa502aa8e170ad7d95231e03.png"></a> <br><br>  On another image hosting: <a href="">link</a> <br><br>  Note: <br><ul><li>  hatching indicates options for which special attention should be paid; </li><li>  if more than one branch to the recommendations comes out of the diamond, you need to choose between these options; </li><li>  if the branchings follow to the next diamonds + to the recommendation, then the recommendation should be implemented in any case.  For example: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/8a3/9a6/b0f/8a39a6b0f8c1a1c8a0a7bef2c6767de6.png"><br><br>  Do not be hateful people need in any case. </li></ul><br><h5>  About cruelty and mercy and what is better: to inspire love or fear </h5><br><ul><li>  awe; </li><li>  disregard cruel charges; </li><li>  refrain from encroaching on the property of citizens and nationals and on their women. </li></ul><br><h5>  How sovereigns must keep their word </h5><br><ul><li>  not to remain true to your promise, if it harms your interests or if the reason that prompted to give a promise is no longer there; </li><li>  look like possessing do-gooders; </li><li>  if possible, do not move away from good, but if necessary, do not shy away from evil. </li></ul><br><h5>  How to avoid hatred and contempt </h5><br><ul><li>  affairs that are not acceptable to subjects, to impose on others, and those that are pleasing to execute themselves; </li><li>  make sure that nothing is done that could cause hatred or contempt of the subjects. </li></ul><br>  Contempt of the sovereigns excite impermanence, levity, effeminate, cowardice and indecision.  These qualities must beware of as fire, trying, on the contrary, to show generosity, courage, solidity and firmness in every action. <br><br><h5>  What should the sovereign do to be honored </h5><br><ul><li>  military enterprises; </li><li>  extraordinary actions; </li><li>  acts to create the glory of a great man, endowed with an outstanding mind; </li><li>  openly declare oneself an enemy or friend; </li><li>  avoid union with those who are stronger; </li><li>  it is necessary to reconcile in advance with the fact that every decision is doubtful; </li><li>  to occupy people with festivals and spectacles at the appropriate time. </li></ul><br><h5>  About the advisers of the sovereigns </h5><br><ul><li>  find out what a helper is worth: if a servant cares more about himself than about a sovereign, he will never be a good servant to a sovereign; </li><li>  try to keep the loyalty of his minister, giving him his due, multiplying his condition, tying him to his bonds of gratitude, sharing duties and honors with him so that he can see that the sovereign cannot do without him. </li></ul><br><h5>  How to avoid flatterers </h5><br><ul><li>  to distinguish several wise people, to give them one the right to express everything that they think, but only when and what is asked about and in no other way.  It is necessary to ask widely and about everything and listen to the answers, the decision is to be made by oneself and at one‚Äôs own discretion; </li><li>  with each of the advisers, we must behave in such a way that everyone will know that the more fearlessly they speak, the more they will please the sovereign;  but not to listen to anyone outside them, but to go straight to the intended goal and firmly stick to the decision made; </li><li>  upset anyone who wants, unsolicited, to give advice; </li><li>  worry, noticing that for some reason someone is afraid to tell the truth. </li></ul><br><h5>  What is the power of fate over people's affairs and how can you resist it </h5><br><ul><li>  persistence in the course of action; </li><li>  change the character in harmony with time. </li></ul><br><h4>  Afterword </h4><br>  Please do not blame much on the stylistic performance.  And expressing dissatisfaction is softer :) The goal was not to make it beautiful, but more or less convenient and informative. <br><br>  Of course, this scheme will not replace the book, but I think that the memo is good enough.  Because I strongly recommend reading the product. <br><br>  Thanks for attention. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/141162/">https://habr.com/ru/post/141162/</a></p>
