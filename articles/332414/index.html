Is it important or not?  Probably not.  More importantly, the language continues to actively grow and develop, despite the fact that <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DNPB34lDZj3E">someone</a> may not like the vector of development. <br><br>  Generally, doing HolyJS is always nice.  While we are in the Java world for four conferences (two Joker and two JPoint), we are <a href="https://jug.ru/2017/05/java-9-postponed-2/">waiting for the release of the new version</a> , JS continues to acquire new features and hyip frameworks, and so fast that our program committee has difficulty keeping up.  It is good that the conference program is built not so much around HYIP products as around things that are useful in life, and they are much less. <br><br> <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/p/332414/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/408/49e/0ab/40849e0ab367476299a7222e2860776a.jpg"></a>

      Passed this year HolyJS in St. Petersburg has grown to half a thousand participants and two days, and <a href="https://holyjs-moscow.ru/">read</a> about <a href="https://holyjs-moscow.ru/">HolyJS 2017 Moscow</a> , which will be held on December 10-11 at Radisson Slavyanskaya, under the cut. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  Two days </h2><br>  I can't help but do a self-replay and do not post a wonderful tweet about the two-day HolyJS for the second time, for those who missed the announcement of the St. Petersburg conference: <br><div class="oembed"><twitter-widget class="twitter-tweet twitter-tweet-rendered" id="twitter-widget-0" style="position: absolute; visibility: hidden; display: block; transform: rotate(0deg);"></twitter-widget><blockquote class="twitter-tweet twitter-tweet-error" align="center" data-twitter-extracted-i1552559803537458076="true"><p lang="ru" dir="ltr">  - The next <a href="https://twitter.com/HolyJSconf">@HolyJSconf</a> will go 2 days?  - Yes, on the 1st day, the names of the frameworks that managed to exit after the previous conference will be read out. </p>  - Kir (@ octav47) <a href="https://twitter.com/octav47/status/829635236518588420">February 9, 2017</a> </blockquote><script async="" src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div><br><br>  As you understand, we have already run in a two-day format in St. Petersburg, it turned out well.  So that you don‚Äôt try to catch me in the comments, I‚Äôll say right away: there will not be 2 times more reports, but due to the two-day format you will be able to visit more reports (most likely, 14 time slots in two days instead of 8 in one).  Moreover, we will most likely repeat the practice of the last time and make one of the two-track days in order to select the reports more strictly and more exactingly. <br><br>  Reports will be a little longer - 60 minutes per slot, and tormenting the speakers with personal and not-so-great questions in the discussion zones will be twice as long.  Finally, it will be banal to take a pause, if at some point you feel that your brain is beginning to slowly flow out of your ears. <br><br>  And for those who will not be enough for two days, there will be a third day with large workshops, but I will tell about this a little later. <br><br><h2>  <b>Conference speakers and program</b> </h2><br><img align="left" width="200" src="https://habrastorage.org/web/e70/364/668/e70364668279451b8a511ace4ee5f369.png">  <b>Douglas Crockford</b> - the praises of Douglas I sang last time and am ready to do it again.  In Petersburg, I managed to get acquainted with the legend of JS personally, to watch a couple of his reports live and to communicate not only about the fate of the YaP, but also ‚Äúfor life‚Äù.  As organizers, we never for a moment regretted having to pay for Douglas a business class from the USA and back (when I found out how much it cost, I turned gray) - so I am happy to announce that this time Douglas will be in Moscow.  Most likely, he will again have two reports: Post Javascript Apocalypse and a report on asynchronous programming. <br><br clear="left"><img align="left" width="200" src="https://habrastorage.org/web/086/350/1d5/0863501d58f646d6ada665ebaeba10cd.png">  <a href="https://twitter.com/smashingmag"><b>Vitaly Friedman</b></a> is Smashing magazine‚Äôs chief editor, web designer and developer.  While the topic of his report has not yet been selected, however, most likely it will be one of two things: <br><br><ul><li>  <b>New Adventures in Responsive Web Design</b> - a report on how to build fast, resilient, and flexible systems that enable responsive web design, based on HTTP / 2, Service Workers, Responsive Images, Flexbox, SVG, and Font Loading API; <br><br></li><li>  <b>Big Bang Redesign: Smashing Magazine's 2017 Relaunch, a Case Study</b> - a detailed analysis of the Smashing Magazine relocation to completely new technologies in 2017.  The report is planned not abstract and entertaining, except for failures and successful solutions, Vitaly will tell how they use HTTP / 2, service workers and serverless architecture for the generator of static sites.  There will be a bit of React, Firefox, CSS and a story about the GitHub-based editing process. </li></ul><br><img align="left" width="200" src="https://habrastorage.org/web/042/333/f0b/042333f0beb74835a37baf08e4896e18.jpg">  <b>Martin Splitt</b> is one of the contributors to WebVR, a frequenter of front-end and JavaScript conferences that consistently ranks among the top 3 speakers.  The theme of Martin is not clear yet, but one thing is sure: it will be not only fun and interesting, but also useful.  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3D39MiUkGSEks">Video</a> from the last conference in Moscow. <br><br clear="left"><img align="left" width="200" src="https://habrastorage.org/web/03c/b37/c0f/03cb37c0f66040aeb718f456406c62ad.jpg">  <b>Thomas Watson</b> is the meintener of a good hundred open source projects and a member of the Node.js Diagnostics Working Group.  Last time, Thomas delighted the participants with a hardcore report <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DbriH-bfleIM%26index%3D10%26list%3DPL8sJahqnzh8IDythQu3ZJPqnvuSXQF8MV">about Node.js profiling</a> .  This time there will be something new, no less hardcore and incendiary (hi, FlameGraph) <br><br clear="left"><img align="left" width="200" src="https://habrastorage.org/web/663/23c/0d5/66323c0d5e614ac6b10de47f6c8e87b7.png">  <b>Mathias Buus Madsen</b> is a big fan of P2P and open source, Mathias also pleases with hardcore reports.  Last time, he talked <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3D7tf14VpeHlE%26list%3DPL8sJahqnzh8IDythQu3ZJPqnvuSXQF8MV%26index%3D21">about creating a fully P2P implementation of the modular ‚Äúdropbox‚Äù with no limit on file size</a> , and this time it will be about P2P ‚Äúkey-value‚Äù storage, which works both in the browser and in the nodes.  It will be about how it all works, about the security model and how cool things you can do with HyperDB (this is the name of the subject). <br><br clear="left"><img align="left" width="200" src="https://habrastorage.org/web/e8e/4ae/43f/e8e4ae43f8904a308ac0ce63c712f9a6.jpg">  <b>Lea Verou</b> is the author of the book ‚ÄúCSS Secrets‚Äù and one of the CSS Working Group experts.  While someone divides people into ‚Äúdevelopers, techies,‚Äù and ‚Äúhumanities designers,‚Äù Leah is known for her love for both code and design, which she put into practice in several open source projects ( <a href="http://prismjs.com/">Prism</a> , <a href="http://dabblet.com/">Dabblet</a> and <a href="https://leaverou.github.io/prefixfree/">-prefix- free</a> ).  The topic with which Leah will speak is not yet defined, and you have the opportunity to influence this decision.  To do this, follow <a href="https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/MAvo2017HJM">the link</a> and leave your vote for one of the possible reports (only 3 options). <br><br clear="left">  These are the hottest speakers, but if we talk about the program as a whole, the following lineup is planned: 4 architectural reports;  4 language / specification reports;  3 reports on the reactor, 2 - on the angular;  Several reports will be devoted to JS runtime, a couple of reports on web components and node.js, well, something else from the area of ‚Äã‚Äãinteresting and curious. <br><br><h2>  <b>Workshop Day</b> </h2><br>  As I promised at the beginning, I will tell you a little about the third day of HolyJS 2017 Moscow.  For the first time this year we will make a dedicated day for trainings and workshops.  Each workshop is a separate event with a length of 6-8 hours, as practical as possible, where you will have the opportunity not only to listen to something new, but also time to ‚Äútouch‚Äù this matter and ask the moderator your questions.  In fact, in one day you will get enough knowledge and skills to continue to independently deal with the technology, without looking at Google every 15 minutes.  There are no detailed descriptions of the workshops, but there is a list of presenters and almost all of them have topics: <br><br><ol><li>  Vitaly Friedman - Smart UX Design Patterns; </li><li>  Denis Mishunov - workshop dedicated to performance on the web.  From all points of view: from technology to the psychology of the user; </li><li>  Mathias Buus Madsen will break the WebAssembly by bone; </li><li>  Slobodan Stojanovic - is not yet clear. </li></ol><br><h2>  <b>Call For Papers, or submit a report to us</b> </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/afb/025/a07/afb025a0793041cab289341ad6cfa443.jpg"><br><br>  If you like not only to receive knowledge, but also to share it, pay attention: now is the time <a href="https://holyjs-moscow.ru/callforpapers/"><b>to submit a report to us</b></a> !  Although our strict program committee includes only really good performances in the program, the same committee helps the speakers bring their promising developments to the appropriate level - so even if you do not have much experience in speaking, there is an interesting topic, do not be afraid to apply. <br><br>  And if you have experience, refer to the video recordings of reports that you did earlier, and this will significantly speed up the decision making by the program committee. <br><br>  The main requirement: your report should be useful to other developers.  We are interested in reports on the following topics: <br><br><ul><li>  Architecture of modern JS applications </li><li>  JS and ECMAScript specification </li><li>  Practice of using ES6 and ES7 </li><li>  Optimization and Performance Issues </li><li>  Functional JS Programming </li><li>  Node.js: best practices, performance, memory management </li><li>  Client server synchronization </li><li>  Application Testing </li><li>  Chrome devtools </li><li>  Work with graphics (WebGL, D3.js, etc.) </li><li>  Web API (Bluetooth, Network API, IndexedDB, Web Notifications, etc.) </li><li>  WebAssembly </li><li>  JS engines </li><li>  JS on devices </li><li>  Progressive web apps </li><li>  Service Workers </li><li>  Desktop apps (Electron, etc.) </li><li>  Web developer workflow </li></ul><br><h2>  <b>check in</b> </h2><br>  The conference program will gradually be replenished, and you can monitor its most current state on the <a href="https://holyjs-moscow.ru/">HolyJS 2017 Moscow</a> website.  And now <a href="https://holyjs-moscow.ru/tickets">the sale of tickets</a> is <a href="https://holyjs-moscow.ru/tickets">open</a> on this site - the early bird price is valid until the end of July.  Therefore, it is better to follow the development of the program with a ticket in your pocket :) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/332414/">https://habr.com/ru/post/332414/</a></p>
