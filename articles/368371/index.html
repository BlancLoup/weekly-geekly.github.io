      The GRE test preparation process is very laborious and time consuming.  After all, for its successful delivery you need a good store of knowledge and skills in various fields.  Today, students have the opportunity to use for the preparation of various materials for the GRE test practice.  However, the first thing you need to pay attention to is the level of English.  To understand the conditions of tasks and their quick execution, it must be at least Advanced.  Even those who consider their level of English to be good enough are recommended by experts to work on improving it.  To do this, we recommend to pay attention to the online simulator <a href="http://www.testprep.ru/ru/">TestPrep</a> . <br><br>  <b>The importance of practical training</b> <br><br>  Many make the mistake of concentrating on learning the theory, completely forgetting the GRE test practice.  If you want to get a high score during testing, you need to understand how important the practice is when preparing. <br><br>  <b>Introduction to the test</b> <br><br>  Regular implementation of practical exercises has a lot of advantages.  First, it allows to study in more detail the features of the structure of the exam and its tasks.  The GRE exam has three sections, each of which evaluates a particular skill: you need to understand the meanings of words well, be able to analyze the structure of the text, highlight the main meaning and draw concrete conclusions, analyze and interpret mathematical data, you must demonstrate the ability to present it beautifully, structured and competently thoughts in writing.  In addition, in each of the sections there is a certain set of tasks, which differ among themselves in requirements and format.  Having dealt with the subtleties of their implementation during preparation, you will be able to significantly increase your chance of getting a good grade. <br><br>  <b>Work on speed</b> <br><br>  Performing various exercises provides an opportunity to learn to feel the time.  On a real exam, it is limited: all sections need to be completed in about 4 hours.  If during the GRE test practice you do not learn how to quickly complete the tasks, then on the exam it will become a real problem, since you may not have time to complete all the sections.  Using trial tests, you can develop the skill of doing exercises quickly and determine the optimal pace that will allow you to cope with the tasks of all sections without haste and delay.  At the same time, you will also feel in what mode you will have to solve tasks on the actual exam. <br><br>  <b>Assessment of knowledge</b> <br><br>  Practical tasks are also important because they allow you to see the level of your knowledge.  In this case, you can also use the test tests, which have an automatic evaluation system.  Performing exercises, you can see the real level of their knowledge.  You will also understand which tasks present the greatest difficulty for you.  Having time to prepare, you can replenish your knowledge base, more thoroughly understand the tasks and teach them to quickly perform.  In addition, the results of such a test will assess their readiness for the upcoming exam at the end of preparation. <br><br>  <b>Preparing for GRE: Work on each section</b> <br><br>  The strategy for successful preparation for the GRE exam is to carefully study each of its sections.  Below we will give tips on successful preparation for all sections separately. <br><br><ul><li>  <b>Verbal Reasoning Section</b> </li></ul><br><br>  The most difficult for many is the verbal section (Verbal).  The main instrument of verification is a few passages of the text and 40 questions that need to be answered after reading them.  All of them are designed to assess the student‚Äôs ability to draw conclusions, use arguments, identify key points, and also understand printed text and individual words.  In order to successfully cope with all the tasks, the preparation for the GRE should include regular reading of various literature, learning new words and complex lexical structures.  In addition, the candidate must learn to quickly determine the main meaning of the read and intelligently reason using the available data. <br>  In the process of preparation, it is recommended to do an internship based on test tests and various exercises that can be easily found on the Internet. <br><br>  We recommend to pay attention to the following resources: <br><br><ol><li>  <a href="http://www.greguide.com/gre-practice-tests.html">www.greguide.com/gre-practice-tests.html</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://www.manhattanprep.com/gre/resources/practice-gre-test-full.cfm">www.manhattanprep.com/gre/resources/practice-gre-test-full.cfm</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://www.kaptest.com/gre/gre-practice/free-gre-practice-test">www.kaptest.com/gre/gre-practice/free-gre-practice-test</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://www.testprep.ru/ru/about/%3Fsl%3D73">www.testprep.ru/ru/about/?sl=73</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://www.testprepreview.com/modules/analogies1.htm">www.testprepreview.com/modules/analogies1.htm</a> </li></ol><br>  This will allow you to get acquainted with the requirements of this section in more detail and gain valuable skills in the quick execution of tasks. <br><br><ul><li>  <b>Quantitative Reasoning Section</b> </li></ul><br><br>  The math section of GRE corresponds in complexity to the high school curriculum and is based primarily on data interpretation.  It includes 40 tasks that allow assessing the candidate‚Äôs ability to analyze numerical data and use various mathematical models.  In order to successfully complete all the tasks in this section, one must learn not only to solve various problems of arithmetic, geometry or algebra, but also to analyze numerical information. <br><br>  The problems of statistics and probability theory are of particular difficulty, therefore it is important to pay special attention to them in preparation.  In addition, the preparation for the GRE should provide skills for performing various tasks.  And this can be achieved with the help of regular practice using trial tests.  Performing training exercises trial tests, such as: <br><br><ol><li>  <a href="http://www.ets.org/gre/revised_general/prepare/powerprep2/">www.ets.org/gre/revised_general/prepare/powerprep2</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://www.majortests.com/gre/problem_solving.php">www.majortests.com/gre/problem_solving.php</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://benchprep.com/gre">benchprep.com/gre</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://www.free-test-online.com/gre-general-test">www.free-test-online.com/gre-general-test</a> </li></ol><br>  Thanks to the trial tests, you will study the specifics of the tasks and their requirements in more detail, as well as gain valuable skill in solving them under conditions of limited time. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e37/835/a63/e37835a63f42439fabd23cd903920250.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Textbooks from official publications will help you in working out the tasks of the GRE test.

With its passage is required to write two essays.  One of them is an analysis of a specific argument, the second is an analysis of a voiced problem.  When checking texts, not only the level of knowledge of the language is assessed, but also the ability to argue their point of view and logically express their thoughts.
