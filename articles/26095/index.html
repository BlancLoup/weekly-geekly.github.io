(reads) ... pulled his tongue, ice on his throat, beat himself, pinched zapromyezhnosti ... yes, you certainly covered all the normal medical methods.  However, how do you beat yourself - with an open hand or fist? <br>  Patient: Open palm. <br>  House: Well, yes, that's what they teach at Harvard Medical. <br><br>  Over dinner with Stacy and her husband: <br>  Mark: You know, I thought you would be full of sarcasm because Stacey married me. <br>  House: You know, we need to do something together: drive balls or something else ... all these men's things. <br><br>  / House wants to come in to Cuddy ... / <br>  Assistant Cuddy: there can not be. <br>  House: who are you and why are you wearing a tie? <br>  Assistant: I am an assistant to Dr. Cuddy.  What is your question? <br>  House: went to find out why she has a secretary, but I don't. <br>  Assistant: I am an assistant, not a secretary - I graduated from Rudgers University. <br>  House: hm?

If she gets better, we will know that we were right.  - And if we make mistakes?  - We learn something else.  © Cameron and House <br>  Who do you need, a doctor who holds your hand while you die, or a doctor who ignores you while you get better?

I hurt them.  © Cameron and House <br>  - If we told you the truth that you correctly diagnosed without a single medical evidence, you would have decided that you are God.  And that you beat the wings.  - God does not limp.  © Wilson and House <br>  “Do you know why people sit in waiting rooms?”  - It must be because it is right.  - People believe that the closer they sit working, the more their care is shown © House and Stacy <br>  “You think I want the whole world to see you staring at your maid and criticizing my wardrobe?”  - Would it be better if I saw your wardrobe and criticized your ass?  © Cuddy and House <br>  - Okay.  I will make you a child.  But first you must write me Vicodin.  Only then will I survive the prelude © House and Cuddy <br>  It is necessary to check for parasites, viruses, bacteria, fungi, prions, radiation, toxins, chemicals, and maybe picked up from porn sites.  I'll check the internet, and you everything else.  © House <br>  - The child is gone ... - Well, you take Alpha Centauri, Forman let Tattwin check, and Cameron will get intergalactic stations.  True, if he used a hyperjunction - we will never find him.  © Chase and House <br>  Talk about the patient's diagnosis: <br>  Cameron: What about sex? <br>  House: Well, it will not be easy.  We work together, I'm older, but maybe you like it. <br>  Cameron: I meant that he may have syphilis. <br>  House: Oh.  Good excuse. <br>  House: People don't need a sick doctor. <br>  Wilson: Logical.  And I do not need healthy patients. <br>  House: There are a million sick people in the world, why should I treat this? <br>  Wilson: Because this one is in our hospital room. <br>  - Brain tumor.  She will die.  Boredom.  © House <br>  - You are an oncologist.  I'm just a pathetic specialist in infectious diseases.  - Yes, of course, just a simple village doctor.  © House and Wilson <br>  “I hired you because you look good.”  It's like keeping a piece of art in the hallway.  © House o Cameron <br>  “What are you doing here again?”  A patient?  - Not.  A prostitute.  Went to my office, not to my home.  © Cuddy and House <br>  - I think your example is incorrect.  - I think your tie is ugly.  © Foreman and House <br>  House and Wilson: <br>  “If I told Foreman,“ Nice try. ”  Great guess, but not this time. ”What do you think he would do? <br>  “I think he would be heading home without feeling like a piece of shit.” <br>  - Right. <br>  - Do you want him to feel like a piece of shit? <br>  - Not.  I don't want him going home. <br>  - Why are you interested?  - Why are you interested, why am I interested?  - Just wondering.  - Me too.  © Foreman and House <br>  House and Cameron: <br>  - And what is this garbage? <br>  - Candy canes. <br>  - Candy canes?  Are you kidding me? <br>  - Not!  After all ... after all, Christmas, and I thought ... <br>  - Relax.  It was a joke. <br>  - Sister Augustine believes in what is not.  - I thought it was a professional requirement for people like you.  © Nun and House <br>  Cuddy appears in a sweater with a deep neckline.  House: <br>  “Excellent suit, Dr. Cuddy.”  He seems to be saying: "I am a professional, but still a woman."  In fact, he just shouts the second part. <br>  - Your big cane is also quite invisible. <br>  - Actually, every time I put on a holiday cap and celebrate the fact that the Earth once again circled around the Sun.  I really thought that this time she would not succeed, but what the hell is this Planet Who Again Was able.  © House (about birthday) <br>  - I am disappointed.  I sent you in search of great new designer drugs, and you brought me tomato sauce.  © House <br>  “You experience perverse pleasure by refusing me.”  - For this I live.  © House and Cuddy <br>  - Even I don't like you!  - You know, words can hurt!  © Wilson and House <br>  - Need a lawyer!  “Have you killed someone?”  - No one.  But it's not over yet.  © House and Vogler <br>  - Hematoma caused someone.  - What a wonderful diagnosis, under it you can dance!  © Chase and House <br>  - Yes, I understand, House is just a darling.  I just want to hug him and never let go.  © Chase <br>  - Why always Me?  “Because the world hates you.”  Or because it is a diagnostic exercise.  You can choose a reason that is more popular with your ego.  © House and Cuddy <br>  - Be yourself.  Cold, indifferent and detached.  “Please don't make an idol out of me.”  © Wilson and House <br>  Cuddy: <br>  - I need to discuss something with you. <br>  House (loud): <br>  - I will not have sex with you again!  The first time was terrible! <br>  “You're an evil, cunning woman.”  This is terribly exciting.  © House Cuddy <br>  - No, there is no fine line between love and hate.  Between them, the Great Wall of China with an armed guard, exposed every 20 seconds.  © House <br>  - Cuddy considers this case idiopathic.  "Cuddy and idiop" form an important part of this sentence.  © House <br>  - I want you to do your job.  “But, as the philosopher Jagger once said,“ You can't always get what you want. ”  © Cuddy and House <br>  - You know me.  The enmity forcing me to shrink like ... [pause] I can’t think of a non-sexual metaphor.  © House <br>  - What can you add to this dispute?  - Wilson is right, Formanneprav, your shirt is too frank for an office style.  © Cuddy and Hause <br>  - What are you doing?  - Well, you're trying to be me, and I thought about trying to be you.  “You have no rounds for this.”  - But I have a more elastic ass.  © Cuddy and House <br>  “You can't raise your hand.”  - And you can not write standing.  © Cuddy and House <br>  - Pay attention to me!  “Sorry, but then it will be harder for me to ignore you.”  © Cuddy and House <br>  “You have no cancer.”  - You have no dwarfism.  - And at the expense of this you have no evidence.  © House and Cuddy <br>  - How is your prostitute?  “Oh, so nice that you asked — a funny story: she was going to be a hospital administrator, but she didn't like having people in that way.”  © Cuddy and House <br>  “Why do you have to dramatize everything?”  “Because I'm a furious little lap dog.”  Raff Ruff Raff, rarr, raff!  © Cuddy and House <br>  Cuddy: (after finding House where he was hiding) I just went for the smell of arrogance. <br>  Even babies lie.  © House <br><br>  - You attacked the patient!  “Okay, I won't do it again.”  - You will!  - Then in this dispute even less sense.  © Foreman and House <br><br>  The patient's symptom is the loss of free will.  I like.  We can call Thomas Aquinas for a consultation.  © House <br><br>  “I’m an Air Force captain and am awaiting a NASA astronaut training center appointment.”  - I discovered salt and invented FM radio.  © Patient and House <br><br>  - Merry Christmas.  - Happily go to hell.  © Tritter and House <br><br>  - This is vicodin?  - Menthol sweetie.  I thought you were going to kiss me.  © Cuddy and House <br><br>  - Are you Dr. House?  - I feel that I regret about it, but yes!  © Patient and House <br><br>  I do not work in search groups.  And yet, I can not sit, smoke, nervous and doing nothing!  © House <br><br>  - They have a secret club there.  - What's the secret?  That they are all idiots?  © Chase and House <br><br>  - This is the temple of the Lord.  They pray here.  - And so that's why there is such a good reception, and also why there is nobody here.  © Nun and House <br><br>  - The accident did not cause bleeding.  - Yes, the bleeding caused an accident, the blood got on the road was slippery.  © Cameron and House <br><br>  —You want me to treat him?  Drugs in the pharmacy, immobile patient intensive therapy.  It looks like a simple geographic problem.  © House <br><br>  —Balchik just passed the math exam, and then he suddenly felt sick and he stopped realizing where he was.  - Yes, this is how mathematics is manifested.  © Foreman and House </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/26095/">https://habr.com/ru/post/26095/</a></p>
