Only this time is the JPoint not the fourth, but the fifth, and the release was postponed not for the first time, but for the third . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/5b1/cd0/31e/5b1cd031e4224516902c67b8bfa35b74.png"><br><br>  Today I propose to talk about what awaits us on April 7-8: in the end, with this date, there will be nothing, and <b>you can be sure about it</b> .  Now we are doing everything so that at JPoint 2017 the participants could meet with Mark Reinhold or Brian Goetz, although without them we already have several new people who will come to the conference.  Who is it?  Look under the cut.

      In addition, in the text you will find links to the video of the best reports from JPoint 2016. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h3>  "Newbies" and "veterans" </h3><br>  For those who do not know: <b><a href="http://jpoint.ru/">JPoint</a></b> is the largest hardcore Java conference in Russia, which takes place once a year in Moscow. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ca7/91c/a74/ca791ca7486043588835a1df6e7b2cb3.png"><br>  For each conference, we are trying to pull up new speakers, and despite the fact that before the JPoint is almost half a year, we already have several confirmed reports from the ‚Äúnewcomers‚Äù: <br><br><ul><li>  2 reports from <b>Arun Gupta, Couchbase</b> : one is about building <a href="http://jpoint.ru/talks/full-stack-reactive-java-application-using-docker/"><b>reactive Java applications using Docker</b></a> , and the other about <a href="http://jpoint.ru/talks/package-your-java-application-using-docker-and-kubernetes/"><b>containerizing and orchestrating Java applications</b></a> using Docker and Kubernetes. </li><li>  <b>Sven Ruppert</b> with a report on <a href="http://jpoint.ru/talks/practical-proxy-pattern-deep-dive/"><b>how to properly prepare the Proxy Pattern</b></a> , how to combine it with other patterns, making the code more readable, fast and efficient; </li><li>  <a href="http://jpoint.ru/talks/services-assemble-apply-mvp-principles-to-create-cutting-edge-microservices/"><b>In his report</b></a> , <b>Mark Heckler from Pivotal</b> will demonstrate how using the correct programming patterns and open-source solutions to quickly build up his microservice architecture, migrate to it and ensure logging and testing of microservices. </li></ul><br>  However, at the conference it will be possible to meet with the "veterans" of JPoint and Joker.  Many leaders of the tops of our past conferences are already planning a trip to the JPoint 2017, but the topics of the reports are still being clarified: <br><br><ul><li>  <b>Charles Nutter</b> , lead JVM developer from Red Hat, one of the leaders of the JRuby project; </li><li>  <b>Aleksey Shipilev</b> , expert on benchmarking, program performance and optimization methodologies, author of <a href="https://youtu.be/v2XLg4SvCF8"><b>the bloodiest and hardcore reports</b></a> , who blew up more than one brain; </li><li>  <b>Sergey <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/users/walrus/" class="user_link">Walrus</a> Kuksenko</b> , Oracle engineer from the Java Performance team, an expert in program performance optimization, tuning of Garbage Collectors and microarchitecture of modern processors.  Last time I shared the <a href="https://youtu.be/A-K1F3KtPsY"><b>subtleties of setting the "iron" performance</b></a> </li><li>  <b>Yegor <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/users/yegor256/" class="user_link">yegor256</a> Bugayenko</b> , known for his unconventional and bold views on the topic of design and programming, in particular, about the correctness of the PLO ("true OOP").  In combination is the Teamed.io company CTO.  Read more about it <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/jugru/blog/315632"><b>here</b></a> . </li><li>  <b>Kirill <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/users/tolkkv/" class="user_link">Tolkkv</a> Tolkachev</b> , Lead Developer at Alpha Laboratories, an expert in containerization technologies (Docker, Kubernetes) and microservice architecture; </li><li>  Has not yet confirmed his participation (but we are really <b><a href="https://habrahabr.ru/users/lany/" class="user_link">looking</a></b> forward to this) <b>Tagir <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/users/lany/" class="user_link">lany</a> Valeev</b> , a man-stream, currently working at JetBrains.  In the last backstage conversation Tagir said that the topic of Streams in Java, he opened for himself and is now thinking about what else to tell.  Well, we look forward to it, because it will be a fire, regardless of the topic!  If you have not seen his report, I highly recommend to <b><a href="https://youtu.be/TPHMyVyktsw">look</a></b> . </li><li>  <b>Baruch <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/users/jbaruch/" class="user_link">jbaruch</a> Sadogursky</b> , Developer Advocate from JFrog, an expert on Groovy, dependency management and distribution of software components.  Baruch often performs with puzzlers or reports on project building tools, and it's <a href="https://youtu.be/6bN1HcRhse4"><b>always fun and rewarding</b></a> ! </li></ul><br><h3>  Why go at all? </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/338/767/acd/338767acddb340d1af1db3e9b8fb96c0.jpg"><br><br>  For several years, conducting conferences, we are tired of answering this question.  Therefore, we decided to give the floor to our participants, and now is a great moment to share their opinions.  In fact, conferences are needed not so much to get a specific skill (although it happens!), As to reload consciousness and understand what will happen in the Java world tomorrow!  Here are some of the feedback from participants: <br><blockquote>  It is impossible to consider the benefits of the conference directly, they say, "so I learned something and now I will go to cut it."  It is rather a "push" for further detailed study and viewing.  Still, we are already well-worn guys, it is difficult to surprise us with something. </blockquote><br><blockquote>  Today I am interested in two topics: microbench marks and problems with microservices and distributed logging.  I communicate with people, learn how to do it, get useful information and solutions for myself. <br></blockquote><br>  However, some of the most practical reports settle in the heads of developers and give their results: <br><blockquote>  At the JPoint, I once heard <a href="https://youtu.be/3A_djdEucnw%3Flist%3DPLVe-2wcL84b-Waky1nkWVSNHPg6eOQWU9">Andrei Pangin's hip-dump report</a> .  One day at work, the food went down, and I remembered the report and what was said in it, and decided everything without Google - having gained advantages in my karma and the respect of my colleagues.  A very nice bonus after the conference! </blockquote><br>  Just think, if you find something new in the reports of past conferences, how much you can learn before, just by spending a couple of days attending the conference.  However, someone uses JPoint to benchmark their team: <br><blockquote>  The conference is a place to talk and some way to break the isolation of your team.  See what's in trend, what people are doing.  See how relevant your team is right now. </blockquote><br>  In general, if you have not been to Joker / JPoint, we suggest you to watch a small clip for 8 minutes, which will help you understand the scale of the conference and the atmosphere prevailing in it: <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://player.vimeo.com/video/171911160" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><h3>  Call for Papers </h3><br>  If you want to talk about something hardcore and new Russian Java-community - <a href="http://jpoint.ru/callforpapers"><b>give us a report</b></a> ! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e24/231/ed3/e24231ed3d5a43deaacbfa828ca07e85.jpg"><br><br>  If you have already spoken somewhere and have met a warm welcome from the organizers and the audience, show us the videotape of the report - this will significantly speed up the decision making by the program committee and increase your chances of performance.  Class performances in the past is one of the important criteria that traditionally guides our program committee. <br><br>  Beginners should not be afraid either - we will definitely communicate with everyone.  Moreover, if your topic is fresh and interesting, we will do everything to hone the content of the report, the technique of performance, timings and presentation, in general, to prepare the perfect report with you, for this we even started a <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/jugru/blog/315864/"><b>special section in the blog</b></a> . <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/661/c14/45e/661c1445edbd4535885626f8336e0dcf.jpg"></div><br>  Traditionally, I remind you that we are only waiting for technical reports.  As they say, only Java, only hardcore! <br><br>  Registration for the conference is open, you can buy tickets <a href="http://jpoint.ru/registration/"><b>on the conference website</b></a> .  Until December 1, we have Early Bird prices that will gradually increase, so do not delay the purchase in the closet. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/315976/">https://habr.com/ru/post/315976/</a></p>
