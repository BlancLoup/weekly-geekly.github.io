  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Parsing: how to properly use Present Perfect in English</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"> <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/444430/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/9b/57/ec/9b57ecnvaqtsfoezg3o5fgwvoti.jpeg"></a> <br><br>  Of all the times used in English, it is Present perfect that often turns out to be one of the most difficult non-natives to understand.  Analogs of this time exist in many languages, but there are subtle differences in use.  As a result, the English version of present perfect turns out to be the source of many errors. <br><br>  The team of the Textly service has published a post on its blog with an <a href="https://textly.ai/blog/how-to-use-the-present-perfect-tense-correctly/">analysis of typical mistakes</a> when using the "perfect".  I prepared an adapted translation of this useful material.

      <i><b>Note</b></i>  <i><b>translator</b> : to understand the material you need to have a basic knowledge of the tenses in English.</i> <a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h2>  Connecting the past with the present </h2><br><blockquote>  <b>Error</b> - I am living in London for three months. * <br>  <b>True</b> - I have lived in London for three months. </blockquote><br><h3>  Explanation </h3><br>  Present perfect should always be used to describe an action that began in the past and continues in the present.  Usually, such descriptions use words like since (‚Äúsince‚Äù) or for (‚Äúthroughout‚Äù) - they are needed to emphasize how long the period of time has passed since the start of the action to the current moment. <br><br>  * In this case, the use of present continuous would lead to the fact that the phrase would sound so that you just stay in London for three months. <br><br>  ** In the case of live, work and study verbs, you can use the present perfect simple and the present perfect continuous to express the same idea. <br><br><h2>  For and Since </h2><br><blockquote>  <b>Mistake</b> - I have lived / have been living in London since three months. <br>  <b>Right</b> - I have lived for three months. </blockquote><br><h3>  Explanation </h3><br>  Since is used to describe the starting point of the action, for is used to express the time during which it lasted. <br><br><h2>  Description of certain moments in the past </h2><br><blockquote>  <b>Error</b> - I have been to Italy last year. <br>  <b>That's right</b> - I went to Italy last year. </blockquote><br><h3>  Explanation </h3><br>  Present perfect is never used in conjunction with a specific time in the past.  As soon as you see a link to a specific point in the past, this means that in this case you can only use past simple.  However, present perfect can be used to express an action in the past that emphasizes some previous impressions or to show the number of times an action has happened. <br><br>  For example: <br><br><blockquote>  I have been to Italy (experienced) or I have been to Italy three times (the number of times) </blockquote><br><h2>  Mention past actions with consequences now </h2><br><blockquote>  <b>Error</b> - Joe changed jobs. <br>  <b>That's right</b> - Joe has changed jobs (the current consequence is that he has a new job). </blockquote><br><h3>  Explanation </h3><br>  The use of the past simple time in the examples above reproduces an action that has no effect at the moment - and this is clearly not what the information is voiced for.  Also, you never need to use the present perfect to indicate the past tense; past simple is more suitable for this. <br><br>  For example: <br><br><blockquote>  Joe changed jobs last week. </blockquote><br>  Using present perfect simple and present perfect continuous <br><br><blockquote>  <b>Error</b> - It has rained. <br>  <b>That's right</b> - It has been raining. </blockquote><br><h3>  Explanation </h3><br>  Why would anyone talk about something like that?  The answer is simple - when this person wants to emphasize the consequences, in this case - that the earth around is wet.  Using present perfect simple focuses on action, not its effects. <br><br>  In addition, it is worth using present perfect continuous if you want to emphasize the period of time that the action lasted, or in order to emphasize the fact that the action has not yet ended. <br><br>  For example: <br><br><blockquote>  I have been waiting for ages or I have been watching a movie (i.e. the movie is not over yet. If you need to say that you watched the movie to the end, then it would be more correct to have I have watched a movie). </blockquote><br><h2>  Already and just </h2><br><blockquote>  <b>Error</b> - I have seen it yet. <br>  <b>That's right</b> - I have already seen it. </blockquote><br><h3>  Explanation </h3><br>  Yet is used only in negative or interrogative sentences.  Already can be used in interrogative sentences (although it is preferable to be later), but much more often it is included in affirmative sentences. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/444430/">https://habr.com/ru/post/444430/</a></p>
