Rather, let us, so that there are no references to different sources, let's call them ‚Äúlevels‚Äù.  Consider this as a lyric, since I myself am not a historian and have not dealt with the ‚Äúscientific‚Äù study of this issue.  He was not engaged in principle, so the story is material, and this question is rather of a spiritual, ephemeral nature.  By the way, if I stumble on the internet, I will find confirmation and support for my thoughts.  Therefore, it makes no sense to spend time on this useless exercise. <br><br>  So "levels."  I believe that the division of people into levels is simply necessary.  What does it mean.  This means that each person should do what he should and not look into his neighbor's mouth. <br><br>  Who should?  Who determines what I owe?

      Nature has created us the way we are.  If a person has a weak heart by nature, then he should not be engaged in weightlifting.  It `s naturally?  I think yes.  This is a caste or "level".  There are people who are higher than me in the ‚Äúheart health‚Äù parameter and I don‚Äôt dispute their ‚Äúsuperiority‚Äù, I have other advantages.  The set of these unique qualities is karma.  Let's call it a ‚Äúway‚Äù, again to avoid arguing about terminology. <br>  Some people have a way to be workers.  They are satisfied with the work from bell to bell and beer on a bench in front of the house in the evening with a neighbor.  They are good at doing their job. <br>  Other inborn traders.  They can sell all that produced the hard worker, resting for a beer, and get the maximum profit. <br>  Third - the military.  These guys do not sell anything, but guard the first two, so they can work quietly. <br>  Fourth - the rulers.  They sit in their offices and rule out questions that the military would not have had to fight, and the merchants and workers did not fight each other by chance. <br>  And the fifth - those who are now, unfortunately not left - the wise.  These comrades with a pure reason from nature, free from material wealth, are able to warn the rulers in time that they are leading their people in the wrong direction. <br>  All these are different levels of human development.  You can break into even smaller steps. <br><br>  So what's the buzz of such a society?  Yes, in that each person does what he can do best, change these levels in places, as the revolution did in its time - everything goes awry: working, unable to govern the country, he has too mundane interests of personal enrichment.  The merchant will not be able to fight, a wicked locksmith will emerge from the wise man, the official will not be able to trade in the market, and the wise advice of the military will lead the country into a bloody war. <br><br>  Here the animals understand this.  A worker ant does not want to fight (I don‚Äôt consider the cartoon of Ant‚Äôs ant), the queen bee will not fly to collect nectar, and tigers will hunt a gazelle each in its own place. <br><br>  A cow who wants to become a race horse will look pretty silly.  "People have the right to choose," many will say.  There is.  But we must understand that there is a right to choose, and there is an unwillingness to follow one‚Äôs path.  There is a choice - left or right lane on the track.  And there is a reluctance to go on my way - I don‚Äôt like this route leading to the city of N, I will go on another, no matter where it leads me. <br>  Example: there is a man and a woman - these are such mega-ways.  A man has certain qualities, and a woman has other qualities.  A woman who takes on the responsibility of earning money is a creature who does not want to go her own way.  A man who wants to deal only with himself is also a creature that has gone astray.  They are both doomed to misfortune. <br>  Girls, if you read this topic.  How do you feel about men hiding behind their women?  Nasty, right?  And now men: what sensations do you have women who traded their families for a career?  Do not excite, right?  And if these guys agreed to submit to their nature, then the husband would take care of the woman, and the wife supported the husband - there is no caste. <br><br>  So with the levels of people is the same. <br><br>  Many may argue that a humanistic society teaches that all people are equal, that now such a society and everything is healthy.  Never is this so.  The idea of ‚Äã‚Äãlevels suggests that all people are born with equal rights.  In no event will the merchant mock the worker for being lower than him.  All of them are equal, have equal rights to life and personal freedom, they simply perform every task they can. <br><br>  The idea of ‚Äã‚Äãcaste is terrible.  If I was born in a certain caste-level, then I cannot get out of it anywhere.  Let's analyze for a second, and now isn't it all around us?  We are there - the guys are so normal, we work, we work.  There are businessmen, and there is a government. <br>  Did any of you have a desire to create a second Google or Lukoil?  I am sure the ideas were.  And what's stopping you?  And an invisible caste called ‚Äúmoney‚Äù prevented you.  Yesterday there was a story about the fact that one lad was promoting his social program, which was supposed to defeat VKontakte.  As it turned out, he will not succeed, because there is no money in order to unwind. <br>  Maybe someone wanted to do politics?  Probably everyone at least once thought: how dirty streets and corruption got me, here I would be ... What prevented it?  Interfered with the caste of "connection", without them not to become an influential person. <br>  Times have changed, but the essence remains.  Only we were given the Ledinets ‚Äúdemocracy‚Äù, we suck it and think that everyone is equal.  But no, before equality, we are even further than in the days of the primitive system.  But I don‚Äôt want to talk about politics at all. <br><br>  So is the transition from level to level not possible?  From what is possible.  There was a merchant, he made pots, gave them to a merchant, then the merchant could not sell them all, and the artisan still had to deal with trade, he started doing it well, for example, he transferred his business to his son, he became engaged exclusively in trade.  Then, when enemies attacked his hometown, he showed himself heroically and entered the service, for bravery in battles he was transferred to the royal regiment, then he showed himself as a good military commander and was appointed to the post where he became an excellent administrator, and then gave the sovereign ends and he became the ruler, and when he grew old, he abdicated the throne, went into the forest and became a monk, to whom the rulers came for advice.  This is highly ideal.  But it is possible and all that is needed for this is to forget for a second about your overly exaggerated ambitions to conquer the world and begin to do a good job with your work.  If you do everything right, then both wealth and power will come to you. <br>  I really believe that.  Rather, I do not believe, but I know that this is so.  From personal experience.  I started working on the 2 course.  Once I accidentally found a local design studio, I came, at first they sent me, but then they took it, offered me some funny money, even in those far (4 years ago) times.  But I did not refuse, it was interesting to do something new.  He worked, worked, made shit designs and was happy, because there was nothing else needed and there was.  Then I accidentally turned up an order for a portal, made it, liked it, started developing this guide, quit my job, started working on information design, there were connections (albeit small ones, but the fact that I go to freelance just read blogs and comment on communities, and orders they find me, speaks about something) and money.  And what would happen if I refused to work for pennies on uninteresting projects, as I understand now, I would not achieve anything.  And now there are a lot of plans, but they should all be implemented in due time. <br><br>  To summarize: each person should do what he does best at the moment, and sincerely believe that the people who are ‚Äúabove‚Äù him are not bad bloodsuckers, but the same gears as he who help him spin himself. <br>  Here it is, utopia) <br><br>  In general, I slept just 2 hours today, so please forgive me for the confusion :) <br>  Good luck and dream come true :) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/58916/">https://habr.com/ru/post/58916/</a></p>
