      - Can I have a look? <br>  - Yes, old man, hold on. <br><br>  Yes, seemingly nothing special.  Only the code on the outer radius began with the number 11 and the letters GK.  Volokha put on glasses and switched view mode.  So it is in this range that the full-fledged keeper logo should be visible.  He switched to the visible range and gave the disk to the guy. <br><br>  - This junk is worth nothing. <br>  - Well, father, do not drive ... Give me at least twenty ... <br>  - Five ... <br><br>  Bargained for a dozen.  Volokha gave the money, carelessly threw the disk into the drawer and instead of goodbye sent the boy away.  The external camera monitoring the entrance to the store conducted the guy, and when he disappeared behind the nearest corner, Volokh pulled out a disk.  This time the analysis was more thorough.  Yes, that is right.  Six-speed protection and, most importantly, Scrooge's genetic material was at the very place where it should be. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  In 2019, hackers from [Pranksters] hacked the metakitaspotary of the gatekeepers and pulled out something more valuable than current information on the financial flows and accounts on which they settle.  From there they got the densest version of the dys - the building material of the Cybernetic Globe - which existed at that time.  The most important thing is that it was not just a dense "basalt", it was a library of basic modules, the alphabet from which dies' combinations were formed, with which you could describe any object of reality and create virtuality of any complexity.  Hackers replicated this library on miniOptic discs and began to trade. <br><br>  Covered them pretty quickly, but the information has already gone to the network.  If the mess can not be stopped, then it should be headed.  The gatekeepers made a limited edition of this library, styling the disc under the commemorative coin and providing all possible protections.  In addition, they made another provocative move - they sewed particles of genetic material from one of the financial directors of GK, known as Scrooge, under the plastic covering the carrier.  Circulation flew in a matter of days.  The total revenue that GK received from this operation amounted to several billion euros, but even the gatekeepers could not foresee the main side effect of the operation. <br><br>  ‚ÄúHard bits‚Äù became the currency, which was sometimes calculated during large transactions, the purchase of expensive material assets, changed into gold and other precious metals. <br><br>  Information has become money in the literal sense of the word. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/27195/">https://habr.com/ru/post/27195/</a></p>
