Only real examples, only dry figures, not supported by the practice of hasty conclusions. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/305/63a/c03/30563ac032a924bbeed1051cc411c32a.jpg" alt="image"><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  To begin with, as befits a real researchers, we define the terms.  Personally, I, as a person, deeply convinced that it is speech that forms our thinking, and any different interpretation of the same terms is the basis of any conflicts on earth, I always try to use only official definitions from Wikipedia.  But they arrived in time: <br><br>  <i>Creativity (from the English. Create - create, create) - the creative abilities of the individual, characterized by a willingness to accept and create fundamentally new ideas, deviating from the traditional or accepted patterns of thinking and included in the structure of talent as an independent factor ...</i>

      ‚ÄúEssentially new, deviating from traditional or accepted schemes‚Äù - this is it, the citadel of evil.  If you and I are not talking about an attempt to create a highly artistic masterpiece that has an intrinsic value as the future cultural heritage of all of humanity, but about an increase in the selling qualities of your business, then there should be no deviation from traditions and generally accepted schemes.  No matter how much you and I don't want this, any creative is more likely to harm you than to bring random success. <br><br>  <b>Argument number one</b> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/f75/128/a40/f75128a40ee1e72be1621a177de8f6fa.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The simplest and most ancient example is a basket in the upper right corner of the screen.  There is nothing more ridiculous than this decision, no one ever in real life holds a basket in the supermarket above his head, throwing up all the purchased goods up to the ceiling.  Hell, that's just stupid.  BUT, stupidity is generally accepted, and any of my attempts today to move the cart down, so that all Internet users would ‚Äúrealistically add up‚Äù rather than ‚Äúpop up‚Äù the goods - they lead to a decrease in conversion.  Checked dozens of times, alas.  People are used to, people want everything ‚Äúlike everyone else‚Äù, people are afraid of any deviations from the norm. <br><br>  Perhaps for more unique things, people-oriented, creative, subtle, refined and highly intellectual - creative has a little more value and benefit?  By no means. <br><br>  As an expert in user experience, I will not say anything without any proof, but will talk about my last experiment on the most creative and spiritually gifted people in Russia.  This is a design thinking competition that is taking place right now at: <a href="https://russiandesigncup.ru/">russiandesigncup.ru</a> <br><br>  <b>Argument number two</b> <br><br>  I purposely chose this particular tournament for the maximum clarity of the illustration of my statement that creativity is the most terrible enemy of humanity.  Well, also because I really liked the task, because nothing more detached from life (in my opinion), it was simply impossible to think: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/d34/65b/714/d3465b7144b0973f39a7c8347900a124.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  You must admit that it was impossible to find a more ideal place for experimenting on creative with the best minds of Russian design.  For the purity of the experiment, however, it was necessary to hide the goals and objectives of the experiment from all participants in the testing, but this only benefited the results. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/ed2/bde/2ec/ed2bde2ec73c73e3a5e56b5239ee59cb.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  And it was here that I tried with all my heart to make the most creative, simply prohibitively going beyond the traditional thinking patterns ‚Äî I invented Teatrooke.  Do not laugh, it was a scientific experiment.  So, what was my decision to combine tasty and healthy food with dusty bookshelves: <br><br>  <i>Suppose a cafe determines the week of Dostoevsky.</i>  <i>Individual readers, and even better teams from several people read the indicated books, taken only from the same cafe, choose the scene, assign roles, rehearse.</i>  <i>On Saturday they present their own show in the same cafe or right on the street in front of it.</i>  <i>All passers-by and occasional visitors appreciate.</i>  <i>The best scene receives a certain bonus from the institution (weekly discount of 50%).</i>  <i>Evaluate speeches can and special jury or the sole owner of the cafe.</i>  <i>These are parts for test operation.</i> <br><br>  Well, that is, I creatively reworked the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãarranging KVN parties in fashionable hipsta cafes and presented the idea in a video format, unlike standard static pictures with presentations.  This is the purest creative test 98, is not it?  And how did the highly esteemed jury react, which (in theory) it is a creative of such a level that searches for cities and villages.  Responded quite expected: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/8c9/e1e/3ff/8c9e1e3ff72e8189b22142c60acd004c.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  You can't say that people do not understand anything in creative?  However, their actions speak for themselves: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/5c4/b1a/7be/5c4b1a7be51509d800ad522bb5eaf883.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  This evaluation is not for execution, not for the quality of drawing the presentation - here it is, the creative in its purest form. <br><br>  Is the idea so bad?  Not at all monetized?  Not able to tear to shred competitors?  Yes, this is not the case, it is simply not at all familiar to the human brain.  It is truly creative, and therefore subconsciously causes rejection from any normal person, because subconsciously it is from novelty that any person feels frightened, and from stable conservatism - peace and satisfaction.  Normal psychology. <br><br>  I know, I know what you thought: <i>‚ÄúYes, you just bombed, because the winners offered even more creative and non-standard moves !!!‚Äù</i> . <br><br>  Well, here you are, and links to those works that won the competition of creatives.  Here, in the eyes of an inexperienced designer, it may seem that the most standard and even standardized thinking approaches are collected.  But the creative is precisely in a clear understanding at the expert level.  that any template is exactly what any person loves most.  I‚Äôm not going to give other people‚Äôs presentations here, so as not to violate the copyright, please follow the links: <br><br>  1st place: <a href="https://russiandesigncup.ru/solution/800/">russiandesigncup.ru/solution/800</a> <br>  A list of recommendations for reading on a tilted iPhone.  I saw this in the form of incoming development orders for web studios and freelancers exactly one million times.  And I will see as much again.  And it is precisely in this coolness - such a solution is already in everyone's head, which means that any character is ready for instant interaction with such an application. <br><br>  2 place: <a href="https://russiandesigncup.ru/solution/824/">russiandesigncup.ru/solution/824</a> <br>  Blackboard with ads.  An ordinary wooden board with pieces of paper pasted on it is an invention that, for a moment, is more than two thousand years old.  Designer creatively worked with the eternal, never go out of fashion patterns of behavior.  That is, all bus stops and garages automatically from today are the Temples of Creativity and Design thinking patterns, do you understand? <br><br>  3rd place: <a href="https://russiandesigncup.ru/solution/844/">russiandesigncup.ru/solution/844</a> <br>  Crafts covers for books (dangerous, too creative word).  Craft, Kolyan, craft!  Well, yes, and of course qr-code, without this, a creative approach to the task would be incomplete.  If the best interface is an invisible interface, then the best creative is the complete lack of creativity. <br><br>  Okay, I will stop torturing you with the pleasure of the best design solutions of 2015.  Just feel the inner level of rejection, which is now in you reading my solution to the problem.  This is your internal conservative declared creative war on unit: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/83c/d8a/211/83cd8a21149364850c80d4ed3d658bba.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  What would it all look like on the screen?  As simple as possible, in the form of ordinary, not distracting from reading the social network notifications. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/987/d08/a97/987d08a97bf60f666e844c5c1739f008.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>We summarize</b> <br><br>  So, what did this social experiment teach us?  The fact that there is nothing worse in design and business than going beyond the established boundaries and standards, and any creative approach will be as much as possible condemned by the most creative people from the most creative professions.  Advertisements on the fence, covers, search engines, search on social networks and a list of recommendations - this is the track that ideally will lead any product to increase conversions and likes. <br><br>  That is why if you are looking for a new design approach for your outdated site to noticeably improve sales, the first thing you have to do is change the packaging of the product, paste ads everywhere on the poles and be sure to launch targeted advertising on the topic: ‚Äú You might like this book and generally subscribe to new items. ‚Äù <br><br>  All that your brain generates beyond these boundaries is a way beyond the red flags, which no one of your potential customers will understand and accept. <br><br>  <b>Related Links</b> <br><br>  <a href="http://megamozg.ru/post/19790/">How people make decisions and assess the situation</a> <br><br>  <a href="https://vimeo.com/139225193">Video presentation Teatrook</a> <br><br>  <a href="https://www.iguides.ru/blogs/probityaudits/technology-getting-rid-of-fat/">We destroy the extra fat of creativity-interactivity</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/295082/">https://habr.com/ru/post/295082/</a></p>
