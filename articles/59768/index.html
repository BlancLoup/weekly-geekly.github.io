My name is Andrey Kashukov and in this post I will tell you about the main points of emigration to Cyprus, based entirely on personal experience. <br><br>  A few words about myself: 1.5 years working as a java-programmer in the city of Limassol (which is located in the Greek part of the island), I live there with my family. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>  This story began, in fact, several years ago.  Then I was a web developer (php, mysql, etc) and wanted to go abroad.  Rather, try to leave, while the years allow.  He went to the goal systematically: he moved to Moscow, found work related to php (but not the web), worked and in parallel studied java.  When I felt that I already had some experience, I began to look for another job related to java in order to gain experience in developing commercial applications and free up time that was actively spent on learning the language and everything that accompanied it plus a search for a foreign employer.

      Searches were quite long.  He looked at different countries, wrote letters, studied websites, searched for Moscow agencies that could help to leave.  After a few unsuccessful months, he compiled a mini-resume in Russian and published it on the most visited RuNet sites dedicated to finding work.  After some time I received a letter from a Moscow agency that worked with Cyprus and offered to undergo an interview.  In the process of a remote job search, I did not consider Cyprus, but at that moment I thought - why not.  Next was a matter of technology.  I had an interview at the agency, then I went to Kiev for a second interview (the representatives of the employer were at that time there and it was a good time to meet and show ourselves).  The second interview went pretty hard;  I think I will never forget him.  4 hours strictly in English, which I then had a very average, were given the last strength in the struggle for a brighter future.  But in the end he passed and began to make out the passport for himself and his wife.  December 1, 2007 was the plane Moscow-Larnaca, then pre-booked a taxi Larnaca-Limassol - and now, I'm at the hotel in Cyprus.  I will add that the employer took over all the costs associated with the flight and helped to further take the family. <br><br>  The first month in Cyprus was training, then another 2 months of training in Israel, then returning to Cyprus and the arrival of the family, then work, work, work.  Now I am in Toronto (Canada) on a two-month business trip, in a couple of weeks there will be a return flight Toronto-Frankfurt-Larnaca. <br><br><h4>  Cyprus </h4><br>  By itself, of course, I like the island.  The climate is very good, the water in the sea is clear, sunny almost the whole year.  Snow in winter is only in the mountains.  Most Cypriots are pretty nice people, sometimes naive, sometimes slow.  The atmosphere of leisure in everything and in a few months you relax yourself - where to rush, if near the rustling of the waves and the sun over your head.  It is also worth noting that we live 200 meters from the sea.  I have been running around 7-8 km along the sea for about a year now.  Many residents are engaged in sports, and the climate itself somehow pulls to recovery. <br><br>  Another big plus is that there is no crime on the island.  Rather, it is, but if we compare it with other countries, then we can say that it is not.  It has a great deal and gives confidence in the future.  In particular, you are no longer afraid to walk in unknown areas at a later time of day. <br><br>  Good attitude to the Russians.  At least I have not experienced any negativity during the whole stay.  Many Russians already live on the island (in particular, during a walk you can often meet fellow countrymen).  There are Russian shops, there is one Russian radio, a couple of newspapers and a couple of sites where many Russians live here hang out. <br><br>  In Limassol, Russian signs are everywhere, attracting Russian tourists, who are smaller in relation to the British and Germans.  But Russians often rest ‚Äúmore widely‚Äù and for this reason they become attractive customers.  It is also worth noting that tourism is the main source of income for Cyprus. <br><br>  Prices for goods are different, but comparable to Moscow.  In something lower, in something higher.  The range is worse, the stores are smaller and they themselves are smaller in size (although there are several supermarkets).  Plus, the work schedule of the stores coincides with the usual work schedule - from 9 to 18, including 2 hours of lunch.  On Saturday they work only until lunch, on Sunday they do not work in principle.  On Wednesday, they work like a Saturday - just before lunch.  Therefore, for many, the weekend is as follows: on Saturday they visit supermarkets by car, buy food for a week, then either rest or go about their business. <br><br>  <b>Transport.</b>  With public transport is tight, especially in Limassol - there are a couple of bus routes, but they rarely go and the devil knows where, so we can say that there is no public.  99% of residents acquire cars.  If necessary, there is a taxi. <br><br>  <b>Housing.</b>  With housing here is better than in Moscow, although prices are comparable.  At the same time, the apartments themselves are considered not by rooms, but by bedrooms (single, double, triple, etc.).  Not in rooms, because in any apartment there is a hall (even in one-room ones, called studios).  Therefore, a single - it is, in fact, two-bedroom.  The hall is mainly used as a hall - it is not very comfortable to sleep in it. <br><br>  We rent a double for 500 euros per month plus 50 euros - common expenses (for an elevator, territory cleaning, garbage, etc.).  But!  The apartment itself is 90 sq. M.  m. and well furnished, air conditioning in the rooms, two toilets.  Photos from the inside can be viewed in my personal blog: <a href="http://www.kashukov.com/%3Fp%3D410">http://www.kashukov.com/?p=410</a> <br><br>  Three friends rent a three-bedroom for 600 euros 120 square meters.  m. There on one of the verandas you can freely play football. <br><br>  Another subtle point: there are no special problems with the removal of apartments.  Some even rent houses.  In my case, the owner of the apartment paid the agent for finding me (!).  I did not pay the agent.  After Moscow, it was a shock.  Plus, there is no monopoly of rental agencies.  But the first shock, of course, was the size of the apartment during its initial inspection. <br><br>  In addition to the cost of renting there are costs for electricity, water and garbage.  Electricity is the most expensive - we pay differently, but on average 200-250 euros in two months.  Electricity in general for Cyprus - one of the main problems, like water.  There is no central heating on the island as a class (although it is said that it already appears in new houses) and therefore it has to be heated in winter with air conditioners that consume conspicuously.  In the summer, air conditioners are used for cooling.  Water - about 30-50 euros per two months, garbage - now I do not remember exactly, something about 70-90 euros every six months.  There is no gas supply, each apartment has a gas cylinder, which is enough for about a month if you live with your family and whose replacement costs 10 euros.  Plus 50 euros per month for ADSL Internet. <br><br>  <b>Languages</b> (my favorite topic).  99% of the population here know English and you can live your whole life talking only in it.  But the state language is Greek, and if there is a desire to communicate fully, you need to pull it up.  There is also Turkish (in the Turkish part of the island), but we live in the Greek and therefore, a few months ago, we began to master the Greek.  We go with the spouse to municipal courses once a week.  I have English every day at work, so there are no problems with it. <br><br>  I want to write about English separately.  At first, of course, there were big problems.  I flew to the island from the upper-intermediate level (as it was evaluated at the interview), but there wasn‚Äôt much speaking practice.  Two months before departure, I listened to ESL English podcasts, read textbooks, but upon arrival it turned out that this was not all that.  In order to know the language, you need to surround yourself with an atmosphere.  Eliminate Russian to the maximum and listen, watch, read only in English.  Day after day, step by step will lead to the result.  To study the language, its features and traditions of the population, but not to learn.  Teaching without practice is a waste of time. <br><br>  Well, when you communicate with carriers.  I also had to (and have to constantly) talk with the Indians.  But not only with them, of course.  Bad at first knowledge of English and a strong accent of Hindus (who spoke, he knows) was a strong blow to self-esteem.  But gradually, gradually, leveled out.  Now I understand them 100%.  He started with the use of a small vocabulary, but one that he knew for sure.  Then he began to expand the times, besides simple, he also inserted perfect conversations, for example, to memorize unfamiliar words and try to use them on occasion.  Now, after 1.5 years, I am already free to watch films in the original.  Specifically, I am watching the 5th season ‚ÄúLost‚Äù.  While I am writing this post, the next episode is swinging. <br><br>  <b>Job.</b>  In Cyprus, there are not so many places where you can get an IT person. <br>  I suppose that in times of crisis it will be even harder and companies will prefer to hire local ones, but it‚Äôs worth a try - if you have a desire to move here. <br>  At one time, I collected a list of companies where you can try your luck.  Here he is: <br><ul><li>  Amdocs (www.amdocs.com) </li><li> Primetel (www.prime-tel.com) </li><li>  CTL (www.ctl.com) </li><li>  Asbis (www.asbis.com) </li><li>  Edams (www.edams.com) </li><li>  ThunderWorx (www.thunderworx.com) </li><li>  CYTA (www.cyta.com.cy) </li></ul>  It‚Äôs not a fact that this list is complete, but I haven‚Äôt yet found other IT companies.  Who knows - write, I will expand it. <br><br>  <b>Education.</b>  I can‚Äôt say anything about higher education - as long as there was no need to study, I can only write a few words about the initial one.  The daughter is now finishing 1st grade (we wrote her down immediately upon arrival on the island).  He goes to a Russian school with an in-depth study of English and Greek.  English every day, first lesson.  For the summer we plan to give to the English summer camp.  He studies excellently, which makes us very happy.  The school is private, paid by the employer.  In a class of 15 people, all classes - one by one, without letters (1, 2, 3, etc.).  Regular tours are organized around the island. <br><br>  <b>A crisis.</b>  The crisis on the island is not felt strongly - my family (pah, pah) did not feel it.  There were layoffs in various organizations, but I would not say that this is a trend.  Summer and the influx of tourists will show whether the island will manage this year. <br><br>  I scrolled up and realized that the post was quite long.  In this case, much has not yet been told.  If you have questions - ask for what I can - I will answer.  The only thing is that I don‚Äôt have the right to tell about the work in detail (policy). <br><br>  By the way, many topics have already been disclosed in a personal blog - <a href="http://www.kashukov.com/">www.kashukov.com</a> <br>  Advertising was not there, and never will be, so on PR it pulls the stretch (if someone suddenly decided). <br>  A blog for me is another way to communicate with family, friends and acquaintances, many of whom have remained in Russia. <br>  Those who want to learn the history of relocation can look at the ‚ÄúBefore Cyprus‚Äù section or read posts for November-December 2007 (I flew away just then).  I consider the most valuable posts related to the collection of documents. <br><br>  A couple of words for last. <br>  <b>Do not be afraid to dream.</b>  Any dream can be turned into a goal and divided into components.  If, for example, Europe beckons you - look for an employer, learn (but do not learn!) English, step by step.  And everything will turn out, even during a crisis.  I'm sure. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/59768/">https://habr.com/ru/post/59768/</a></p>
