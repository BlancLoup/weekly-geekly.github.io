What the hell is he doing on Habr√©?  And in general, what is a post doing here? <br>  Probably because I consider the main link in IT all the same person, but rather his brain.  I will try to talk about one more opportunity to use my brain a little more effectively.  One of the poorly documented features that we use every day, but not always even remember about it.  Everything described was tested on me.  If I have not tried something, but it is important to talk about it especially.  No drugs, devices and mockery of themselves, only publicly available light techniques (in short, I went to bed and slept, not even getting up from the bed). <br>  And yes ... It is terribly realistic, so much so that having tried, you can not tell about it. <br><br>  In order not to have unnecessary cries in the comments, I will ask all those who are ardent supporters of any religion and denomination, as well as convinced esotericists, to immediately put a minus into karma and not read further.  There will be no philosophy and great universal secrets.  And the rest I ask for the cat - I will try to talk about my practice of overclocking the brain using built-in functions. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  All of you have dreams.  And that's fine.  How many times have you woken up how couldn‚Äôt you believe that it was a dream, it was so real?  How many times did you think you did / saw something, but in fact it never happened?  And how many times did you want to see a dream where you can meet lost people?  How comfortable would it be if someone suggested in a dream how to do / repair / fix some thing, a project, or a car in the end? <br>  As you guessed, I will talk about control of dreams, or rather, about entering a dream and receiving information and sensations.  This is the most important thing for many of us.  Why I asked not to read the post to very convinced people - they require philosophical substantiations, familiar terminology and mystical goals.  I will talk about the practice, a simple practice available to everyone.  And everyone should deal with the philosophy and the moral and ethical side of the issue by himself, well, or in special forums.

      And so: technology is available to everyone, regardless of gender, skin color, religious affiliation or mental abilities.  Problems are possible only for those whose brain is damaged or there are irregularities in its work.  Practice is also available to them, but most likely it will have other principles and a different approach (I don‚Äôt have exact data, I haven‚Äôt checked it with anyone). <br><br><h3>  How it works </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/9f0/abf/e51/9f0abfe51a3191f7cb6cf72084174cd5.jpg"><br><br>  I'm not sure that there are people who are 100% aware of how all the processes in our brain go.  But we don‚Äôt really need this knowledge.  Many people know what virtualization is.  And how can this be in our heads? <br>  When we go to sleep the brain goes through several phases of sleep, many also know this.  At the latter, which calls the Fast Sleep Phase (FBS), the processes begin, are very similar to the waking state, with one difference - the signals are closed inward.  In the normal state, the signal from the eyes enters the brain, the hand movement command is processed and issued, and then the information on the feedback circuit about the position of the hand and that the hand has felt is received.  But in a dream, the signal from the eyes, the signal from the hand and from the hand, does not extend beyond the brain.  And so that we do not jerk like cats and dogs, the brain inhibits signals from the brain to the extremities (the only ones who do not obey this eyeballs, they continue to move, and it is easy to calculate from their movement whether a person is in phase or not).  It turns out all that we perceive and send commands to the body, perceived and generated by our brain. <br>  Here is such a virtual machine of perception. <br><br>  From here comes an interesting fact that must be used - the more you feel and perceive with the virtual body, the clearer and longer your stay in the space of sleep.  (To this we will definitely return with the techniques of retention). <br><br><h3>  The most important thing is safety! </h3><br>  Everyone who has ever heard of meditation, trips to the astral (I am also enraged by this word, but it is), dream management is firmly convinced - this is very dangerous.  But then sleep is dangerous, you can see a dream and get stuck there.  When have you ever thought about this annoying match?  These are all beautiful myths.  At the stage which will be discussed, there are no such dangerous things.  The most dangerous thing is to make pants with fear or delight. <br>  All that you see in a dream is your subconscious with your cockroaches and beliefs.  Do you want enemies and monsters - get momentary, want heavenly pleasures - "get it, sign it."  When you practice yourself, you will laugh at how kicking your chest with your foot, everyone will argue that this is extremely dangerous! <br>  Even with all the safety of a technician, there are precautions: <br>  - It is not desirable to return from sleep (it is better to wait for the release). <br>  - do not bring yourself to hysterics if it does not work.  If you can not take a break for 2-3 weeks. <br>  - before performing life-threatening actions, make sure that this is a phase state.  If you are not sure, just take care of safe things.  Even if you practice any practice, do not forget to turn on the brain. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">About safety and how it is related to physiology.</b> <div class="spoiler_text"> <br>  1. Whatever happens there, wherever you are thrown, you will still be thrown out - FBS lasts a maximum of 15 minutes.  When this phase is over, you will either be thrown into wakefulness or you will simply fall asleep during your normal sleep. <br>  2. It is better not to do independent exit from the phase space, with such an outcome, you can return to the body, but the ‚Äúmotion safety‚Äù has not turned off.  In this case, you will fall into your own body, which well as it does not obey you.  It's really scary, many people even think they are dead.  But scary does not mean harmful or dangerous! <br>  3. You have already returned (well, you were terribly frightened, with whom it does not happen) and the body does not obey you, you are panicked ... Relax and just wait for the end of the phase, well, or go back to sleep.  Most likely you are inside the dream and the space can still be repaired to you. <br>  4. Beginners (like everyone) have stoppers when they are not rushing and that's it.  Scored and rested for several weeks.  Any energy and emotion behave like ordinary muscles - they sometimes get tired and need rest.  Practice should be fun even when it didn‚Äôt work.  I understand that if you try, the first thing you score will be this item.  But I think you will come back to him. <br>  5. Phase state and virtual space of this reality is very similar to reality.  To confuse reality with sleep is very easy, be on the alert, and everything will be fine with you. <br>  6. No, it‚Äôs not possible to get stuck there, several levels are also not entirely true (although you can try and need to try everything).  Without these elements, the movie Inception would simply not have turned out. </div></div><br><br>  In fact, such cases are rare and usually occur at the beginning of the experiment.  The real problem for this kind of phase travel is to stay within sleep.  From there throws out like a champagne cork.  Just any external sound, rustle, touch knock instantly.  But more about that later. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c1c/c34/8bb/c1cc348bbf0133906c0a251988792d69.jpg"><br><br><h3>  What is all this for (what can you do about it) </h3><br>  As mentioned earlier, I am convinced that using all the capabilities of the brain makes a person smarter, better.  Suppose that in a world where many smart people will be more difficult, but the world will be more interesting and more beautiful.  Philosophized and enough, go to the practical side. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">1. Entertainment</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  The sweetest part of this phenomenon. <br>  Here you can do everything: run, shoot, fly, travel, and much more, which your imagination is capable of.  Feel like a hero / heroine of love affairs - please, wanted to run with a gun and tear off a couple of heads - please fly to the moon or to Mars - just manage to choose desires. <br>  The only caveat - you have to feel this world every split second.  Relax does not work, and then knock out.  Thus, to lie on the beach in the Maldives will not work, although playing beach football, swimming, beating up the shark is quite a normal and useful time.  And you can forget about the moral and ethical side - nobody here sees you, and can never know what you were doing here.  This is your world, your paradise, your ... <br>  The item can be expanded to disgrace.  The main thing do not forget to move. <br></div></div><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">2. Getting information</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  This is the most useful, because it is always useful to get information from the depths of the subconscious.  Although at the expense of the source of knowledge is too much controversy.  Depending on your worldview, choose your favorite item (you can do everything at once): <br>  - this is the secret corners of the subconscious, and our brain is capable of processing and storing huge amounts of data, knowledge, skills, feelings and sensations; <br>  - this is a universal information bank to which the brain can connect in this state, and receive any data; <br>  - This is the <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A5%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B8_%25D0%2590%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B0%25D1%2588%25D0%25B8">Akashi Chronicles</a> ; <br>  - this is a genetic memory; <br>  - ‚ÄúA place for your idea is free‚Äù <br>  The most important thing is that the information is available.  How and from where she came to find out exactly for you, but for now let's figure out how to get it and check it. <br><br>  I. Obtaining information from living objects. <br>  This can be any acquaintance who can know the answer to a question, any famous person (although Aristotle, the main thing that could explain), an authoritative person ‚Äî a wise man, an angel or anyone else you can imagine.  When you find your object, ask him your question in the most simple and simple formulation.  Remember that your brain can come up with an answer and produce the desired result (especially when you are waiting for a specific answer), so you need a check. <br>  The test is carried out in the same way - ask a simple question: what is my name, how much is 2 +2, my first cat's nickname ... If the answers are adequate, then you can believe and answer the main question, but you should always check in real life. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">An example of a search is not health in the car.</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  Last time, miracles started with the car, it sometimes does not start.  Moreover, it is always with a half turn on the cold one, and after warming up it sometimes just does not react to the turn of the key. <br>  The forums gave clues but everyone pointed to the starter.  It was time to check, and on the weekend I was seized with silence and sleep.  The breakthrough was the simplest - I woke up and opened my eyes, saw a pale window opposite the bed, but the window to the left, which means I did not open my eyes, but was already on the verge of a phase.  I reached for the window and the feeling was as if I were reaching for it through gelatin.  At some point, suddenly the tension was over, and I was standing opposite the mirror in my room.  A regular room at 5 am, darkly dull and gray, but this is often at the exit - the phase is weak and must be made clear.  Feeling all that is around, I once again was fucking realistic (I‚Äôll probably never get used to it).  I touched, beat on everything with my hands and tried to see everything I could and the picture blossomed with all the colors of an ordinary sunny day.  I rushed to the kitchen, on the way to the window I grabbed a tomato and chewed up checking taste sensations - an ordinary tomato, with the most ordinary taste.  From the window, I saw that just opposite the nearby high-rise building was missing; that means exactly the phase.  I opened the window and jumped out the window, trying to find out where my car was parked, but plopped and couldn‚Äôt make out.  It is not, but will appear when you need it. <br>  - Arthur!  - I shouted, as loudly as possible, and represented the face of our "family mechanic." <br>  ‚ÄúYes, dear,‚Äù his voice came from behind, with an Armenian accent.  Turning around, I saw that the one I needed came out of the next door.  Without looking up from him, I put my hand on the hood of the car, with the certainty that this is mine. <br>  - Tell me what's wrong with the machine: the oil goes off and starts up badly at times. <br>  He came up and opened the hood, and showed which gaskets to replace (not yet checked, but in my opinion they really are).  (Addition: these gaskets have been replaced by a year; 99% hit) <br>  - And what about the ignition? <br>  ‚ÄúLook in the cabin, it seems there is a problem,‚Äù Arthur replied, and leaned back toward the engine. <br>  And I opened the car door, and saw a disassembled steering column with hanging wires of the ignition switch.  The task of the maximum was completed, and I missed the moment when everything swam, and I already felt like I was lying on the bed. <br>  In the morning I disassembled the steering column, and it turned out that the contact group of the lock had simply worn out.  So the problem was solved. <br></div></div><br>  Ii.  Getting information from non-material objects. <br>  As in real life - to find a book and read it.  And you can also use magazines, paintings, photos and ... google.  Why not?  But be sure to try to check everything! <br>  Iii.  Get into the event or see the plot of the event. <br>  You want to see what this or that event looked like, try to be in its epicenter or watch from the side (many would like to look at the epicenter of the explosion at the notorious nuclear power plant).  Or maybe you want to see what your finished project looks like, which is at the design stage?  Why not? <br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">An example of my friend's trip in 1986.</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  My good friend loves abandoned objects and all kinds of ‚Äúnuclear stories‚Äù.  The history of the Chernobyl accident, he knows thoroughly.  I told him many times that you could try to see what was really there, but he waved his hand and twisted his finger at his temple.  But it was not a pleasant story, and it did not work for some time, and there was a lot of free time.  And once he told me that he had seen everything at the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant, saw the moment of the explosion and stood in that room, saw how everything flew away, and what the television reporters told was not quite true, they lowered many moments or did not specifically tell.  But he is a skeptic, and refused to believe in such things until he tried. <br></div></div><br>  Iv.  Direct receipt of information directly into the mind. <br>  <i>As a child, when I tried to find out from my younger sister, how she knew about candy and who said it to her, I often heard the answer: I myself know, I know, and that's it!</i>  <i>I used to laugh, but now it's not a laugh.</i> <br>  To use this method, you just need to think that the information is already known to you and try to apply it.  It sounds absurd, but it's all a matter of practice.  This is the basis of the method, clean information "without crutches."  The 3 previous methods are simply crutches that help your mind perceive information. <br><br>  After receiving the information you need, it is advisable to wait for the release in order to wake up completely and record (fix) the result.  Often, information is simply forgotten from the huge flow of information and emotions. <br><br>  In any case, regardless of the results, turn on the head, re-check all the results.  Do not believe anything blindly! <br></div></div><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">3. Improvement</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  This topic is a little like for the subject of this site, but not to mention. <br>  Everyone understands (even if they don‚Äôt want to believe) that most of the diseases come from the ‚Äúnerves‚Äù or from the ‚Äúbad head‚Äù. <br>  ATTENTION!  THIS IS NOT A REPLACEMENT OF STANDARD PROCEDURES, THIS IS AN AUXILIARY ELEMENT.  IF THE CASE HAS BEEN REACHED TO DISEASE THE DISEASE, SIMPLE ARRANGEMENTS ARE NOT ALREADY DISAPPEARED.  FIRST NEED TO CLEAR SYMPTOMS AND SERIOUS IMPLICATIONS, AND THEN TO TREAT (can be done in parallel, but NOT instead!) <br>  Our body clearly obeys our mood.  And if protracted depression?  And if a few?  And this is not the worst.  It happens that our way of thinking and actions trigger subconscious routines that successfully destroy us.  Such a cure with drugs will not work, maximum suppress the effects.  But this is not a treatment, but a delay ... By this, the subconscious "diseases" (well, let's call them the parasites of the subconscious mind) can be treated with unconsciously-conscious mixtures.  Yes, it is the very suggestion itself, only directly, to the subconscious, because the filters of the consciousness are now weakened. <br>  Treatment in phase sleep is not much different from the usual treatment: <br>  I. Being in phase reality, you are looking for a medicine that would help you.  It does not have to be a real medicine, a blue vial with red capsules will completely disappear, on which will be written ‚ÄúExit from the Matrix‚Äù or ‚ÄúFrom heart diseases‚Äù.  Here the most important point is to feel the effect of the received medicine.  Feel the fire flare up in the stomach, as it flows to the sore spot and heals.  The more colorful the sensations, the better the effect.  The procedure will be repeated as often as possible, there will not be much effect from one time.  With repeated repetition of the subconscious takes the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe health of the body, and does everything you need. <br>  Ii.  You need to find a doctor, and as in the "Obtaining information" section, you can simply ask what medicine you need, or ask for a procedure or even an operation, right in the phase state.  Again, it is important to feel the effect.  This is much more important than the formality of procedures. <br>  Iii.  Just feel that the sore spot is recovering.  This is the basis of the previous methods.  But it does not pass with everyone, because the barriers of consciousness and subconsciousness do not always miss such a thing.  The same, only without crutches. <br>  Iv.  A separate item should be noted treatment of fears.  Unlike other points, this method is used in medicine extremely often.  Both new-minded and proven psychological centers very often teach their clients with this method, and sometimes introduce them to banal hypnosis, where they force clients to face their fears face to face.  And since in the phase it is very realistic, a person has to face and conquer fears.  A strange fact: creating a situation where a phobia manifests itself and when confronted with it in a conscious phase a person very often stops being afraid of it.  How it works, I have no idea, but my fear of height has passed (no, I don‚Äôt walk along the ledges, but I perceive fear adequately). <br></div></div><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">4. Training</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><video>  http://video.yandex.ru/users/rbgor/view/1 </video><br>  For a long time in the world practice of sports they use virtual training methods, when an athlete sleeps or simply lies and in the imagination works out the necessary movements.  The effect is colossal.  And this should be applied not only to athletes.  In the phase state, you may well work out the driving style of a car or bicycle. <br>  As an example, all represent how much a parachute jump costs.  But he is the first and the first jump, and if you need to work out that thread?  It's a lot of money.  But all this is perfectly possible to work lounging on your favorite couch.  This is despite the fact that there is not any costs.  And those who say that a real jump cannot be compared with anything - just try, then I will be ready to discuss everything with you, but not earlier. <br>  You can also try the direct acquisition of skills.  But probably this is aerobatics, I‚Äôm still not completely successful. <br></div></div><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">5. Testing.</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  You, educated people, remember such a person as Nikola Tesla.  Many even heard that he clearly knew what element of his inventions and when he would fail.  He claimed that he collected this apparatus from his virtual laboratory and all experiments corresponded to real actions.  For me a few years ago, it seemed like a fantasy and a miracle.  Now I begin to understand how this was done.  Recently I came across information that the ingenious designer Korolyov used something like that ... He walked around the unit or module for a few minutes and swung (like a trance), then showed that there was a defect in some spare part, and he could break everything, check always showed the correctness of his guesses.  Miracle?  I do not know, the fact remains <br>  And who prevents us from doing the same thing ... After all, everyone has similar tasks.  Even on Habr√© there was already a similar post, where <a href="https://geektimes.ru/users/lipa/" class="user_link">lipa</a> already uses a similar technology <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/153569/">to test the project</a> . <br></div></div><br><h3>  Types of phase dreams and various methods of entry. </h3><br>  Astral, astral projections and similar definitions often scare people who do not like to watch REN TV.  Yes, and these definitions do not have clear boundaries, and each author strives to use them according to his conviction.  If you want, use these words, want to invent your own.  I do not want to bind to the words, I need to convey the meaning of the phenomenon that has existed since humankind exists.  I asked not to read esoteric, they are infuriated by any topic, where the highest ideals and techniques available to the units, are simple everyday things.  This is someone you want to infuriate if you have spent 10 years on training and self-development, rebuilt your thinking for higher goals and practices, and came jerky and said: "Yes, I learned it in a month!".  I would go too ... <br>  And the most ridiculous thing for real practice is that sometimes even special actions are not needed - I woke up and entered the phase state.  Everything! <br><br>  And so, the methods differ: <br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">- Autonomous</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  All methods that use only the capabilities of your body and mind.  This is the easiest method and the most effective.  You do not need additional funds or devices, you and only you.  Why use anything if nature has endowed us with this skill from birth. </div></div><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">- Not autonomous</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  Non-autonomous methods include those that use external catalysts of this state, these can be cacti, narcotic substances, special diets and food (although this is more suggestion) and all kinds of devices or programs (as an example <a href="http://4pda.ru/2014/01/26/137538/">Aurora: The Dream-Enhancing Headband</a> ). <br>  The main problem is that it is ineffective.  Medicines in general can cause a bunch of side effects + addiction, complications ... Hardware tools help 1-2 times, and not always.  And then the brain just adapts to them and you can give a gadget to a friend.  Sometimes other things can act as such devices: when I bought a watch with a projection on the ceiling, I even accidentally got into a phase, I had a dream that they helped me to enter this state.  But only once.  The application on my mobile phone I have never entered into a phase.  Further I will not raise this question. <br></div></div><br>  Autonomous technology entry phase state: <br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">- Through lucid dream</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  The easiest, but difficult to call (often spontaneous) method.  I'm sure all of you, at least once you find yourself inside a dream.  This is when you go to sleep and suddenly it dawned on you - it is not real.  And you start to do what you want.  But I can say more, it happens very often, but the trouble is that we don‚Äôt remember about it.  Do not remember means not considered.  Regarding this technique, many books have been written, not all of them are truthful, not all are of high quality, but it is possible to study.  But the technique has a drawback - the preparation takes a lot of time and is not entirely simple.  Every day you have to notice everything, see, remember, wait at any second for a dirty trick from the world, because it can be a dream every second.  Paranoia you do not earn and it is not sickly pumps the brain, but the brain is constantly adapting, and dreams will be clearer and better, which means it will be more difficult to catch the dream by the tail.

For example, try them hard to push down and up, pull left and right, etc.  If nothing happens, the technique changes to another.  If suddenly there is a light or viscous real sensation of movement, it is necessary to focus attention on the technique, trying by all means to make the amplitude of movement as wide as possible.  When reaching 10 cm and more, you should immediately try to separate from the body, starting the movement of separation from the sensations received from the technique. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/65a/60d/00b/65a60d00be16a6ae71c5cf43e4072281.jpg"><br></div></div><br><h4>  About small breaks. </h4><br>  These breaks are called "power sleep", in fact, it is better described as: "Yes, it went all tries * p * n, I sleep!".  Those.  you just let go of everything and allow yourself to relax, but not for long (5-7 seconds).  At that moment, as the consciousness begins to grow cloudy and all sorts of thoughts appear, we ‚Äúfloat up‚Äù and continue to do the techniques of the cycles.  These "falling asleep" work fine and allow you to increase efficiency several times.  The same should be done when the awakening is too bright, that is, we woke up, and immediately you feel your body, everything is stable and does not even smell like a phase.  We just begin to fall asleep and simultaneously perform or sort out the techniques.  At some point, the consciousness begins to fade and the technology starts to work.  If the first round did not work out, it's okay, just persist in doing it, but keep in mind that any technique should relax you and give pleasure.  And there can be no talk about the correctness of the actions, if you are all enraged.  You can fall asleep a little, but not to wake up (this is my favorite mistake). <br><br><h4>  Reality check </h4><br>  Reality check is a very important thing in phase.  Once in phase, it will be difficult to say that this is it.  Realism can be immediately 100%, which means there is a high probability that you will appreciate it as a reality and you will fall into bed with the thought that you have failed again.  In dreams, there are always artifacts, i.e., some minor flaws in the setting, not the skin color of the crocodile Gena (who pushes a speech about Nietzsche‚Äôs philosophy in the actions of Cota in boots), and in phase the brain is completely capable of creating an environment no different real places, such as apartments.  The pain can be realistic, the walls are hard and it is impossible to pass through them, flying will not pass either.  Although attentiveness has not been canceled yet and be prepared for minor inaccuracies in the situation and what is happening around you.  And whatever happens, never turn off the brain!  This is especially important after you are knocked out of the phase - very often that knocks not into reality, but into a new phase.  It's a shame to lose experience and attempts when you are already in phase. <br>  Top-shaped totem is unlikely to help.  Although each may have their own methods, but consider the general ones: <br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">I. Exhale through the clamped nose.</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  Depending on the depth of the phase, this method may or may not work.  If the phase is 100% realistic, then exhale will not work.  If you breathe out it turned out exactly in the phase state.  Similarly, you can try to take off, fall through the floor or any unrealistic action. <br></div></div><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Ii.</b>  <b class="spoiler_title">Pinch yourself</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  This is the most common misconception.  If you pinch in the phase state, you will definitely not wake up and may even vice versa delve into the phase.  Although my pain does not manifest at all or how, that's why I assess the situation - I pinched and did not hurt, it means phase. <br></div></div><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Iii.</b>  <b class="spoiler_title">Electronic scoreboard</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  A strange feature of the phase state: a digital display of even a simple clock often shows nonsense.  It can be crocodiles, or simply unreal time (for example, in the morning at 21.50 and the Sun is at its zenith).  A couple of times such a check failed me, because the time was 6.20 am, but it was a phase.  But if you still notice a discrepancy, then most likely this is a phase. <br>  With an analog dial this does not work, you will not understand anything by it. <br></div></div><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Iv.</b>  <b class="spoiler_title">The situation is not true</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  The name of the method speaks for itself.  This is not the most effective method, as the phase can 100% reproduce the situation.  But on the other hand, it is the most useful method for the brain - it develops attention very qualitatively, well, it helps with lucid dreams. <br></div></div><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">V. Concentration (Hyperconcentration)</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  The most effective way.  It is based on another important feature of the phase - the items you look at change for a few seconds.  To check, you can use any small object next to him, it is more convenient to use a finger more often.  Just consider, if it was a phase, and you are looking at one point so intently, the phase will float and you can be thrown back.  If the picture begins to float, we use the hold techniques in order not to whistle the phase. <br></div></div><br><h4>  Detailed scheme of each attempt </h4><br>  I think it's time to consider a more detailed scheme of each attempt (the authorship is indicated, taken from the website of the author of these methods and techniques): <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f30/e67/8be/f30e678be348e33e6a3f4165f6d63fc6.jpg"><br>  And now some shocking news.  All that has been described before is just crutches that allow you to simply catch the right moment.  Why are they then?  What would you teach to walk (or rather sleep).  Or do you think that you can lie on the stove for 33 years and just go and go?  A miracle does not happen, just lose hope in yourself.  When is it time to throw crutches?  He himself will disappear, or rather, you just will not use them - you will just feel what and when to do.  Really, don't hurry!  And now I‚Äôm going to say it, and then they will say to me, they say, he said - he needs to do anything, he will come!  It is necessary to do, still as necessary. <br><br><h4>  Contraindications or how not to spoil the phase </h4><br>  I will try to briefly describe what you should not do before and during the phase: <br>  - After waking up, we don‚Äôt lose a single second of time, immediately proceed to the movements.  In this case, the brute force technician should be normal: 2-3 seconds and if there is no effect, we go to the next one, and so on in a circle. <br>  - You shouldn‚Äôt run around in a circle either.  After the first minute, the efficiency drops sharply, and further mockery of oneself can spoil the following attempts.  Just fall asleep. <br>  - Here begins something to turn out, but the technique has changed.  What for?  It works, we bring it to a victorious exit to the phase. <br>  - You shouldn't stop the same way - the equipment began to work, we do not sit and wait for the weather by the sea, we finish again to the victorious. <br>  - You should not go out (share) ahead of time - everything should be clearly and clearly.  But you can not overdo too, so you can whistle the right moment. <br>  - During the exit often want to open my eyes.  This is a very nasty mistake, destroys all actions.  So we tolerate and do not open.  Useful advice here will try to look through closed eyes.  It helps me get into the phase without much effort. <br>  - We don‚Äôt forget about muscles either - the body should roll on a bed, no body movements or even tension in the body.  From the beginning it is difficult to understand how to move a limb at all without straining the muscles.  In fact, it is not so difficult, for this on ordinary days (when you do not plan training) to lie down and practice, to work out all the techniques and attempts to exit. <br>  - You need to wake up without movement.  I also understand that it is impossible to do this, but very often it does not work - I woke up after the movement.  But this should not cause frustration and apathy, otherwise you can make some more mistakes. <br>  - We woke up on the move, upset and scored on everything.  In no case can this be done.  Immediately proceed to search the technician.  If the awakening is too bright, we leave to the minison and then proceed to the technicians. <br>  - Because of the failure to immediately enter the phase, there is a certainty that nothing will work out.  As a result (though not only because of this), apathy and passivity in the performance of the technician arise.  Never do it like this - go ahead and with the song.  Or even what's the point of doing this?  Maybe a ride? <br>  - Worry and too go too far with waiting.  No unnecessary potentials, quietly, calmly and confidently.  And in general, why be nervous, it's your innate ability.  Just need to practice <br>  - Your emotions and willpower are like muscles - they can also get tired.  For this, do not overdo it with attempts 2-3 days a week.  And also do not do evening workouts before the morning exit.  Just in the evening you profukate the full potential and in the morning the exit into the phase will be difficult. <br>  - We think too much and every second we analyze what is happening with an inner voice (My favorite mistake).  We shut up the inner voice and do it - at this stage we turn off paranoid thoughts, here we need actions.  The brain will turn on when we are in phase. <br>  - Hold your breath or do not breathe hard.  I love this mistake very much, I often come across it myself.  If breathing interferes with you, this is a sign that you are focused on the physical body.  Distract slightly, do everything as if in a fog.  No need for clear thought-out movements, everything seems to be in the water.  At the same time, stubbornness has not been canceled. <br>  - Once in the phase do not stand still.  Movement and action. <br>  - Beautiful pictures are good, but after watching it is easy to lose a phase.  It is also easy to fall asleep.  Those.  you will lose awareness and plunge into the most ordinary dream. <br>  - Clearly follow your goals, do not get distracted by the scenery of sleep: if someone fell, do not pick it up, broke it or dropped it - do not try to fix it.  It is fraught with immersion in sleep and loss of awareness. <br><br><h3>  What may disappoint you </h3><br>  You might think that there is described a panacea for all the issues in your life?  You can ask ‚ÄúThe Most Important Question of Life, the Universe and Generally‚Äù, but the answer is unlikely <br>  will it be much smarter than "42".  According to the author of the book, "we can get information exceeding our personal knowledge several thousand times."  Again disappointed?  I'm sorry I did not want ... <br>  But on the other hand, just imagine that you can get information 1000 times more than you currently possess.  Not bad?  And if you consider that you can also learn and increase all this, which means your abilities will multiply by 1000. Most likely the trouble is that if the brain knows the answer, then it does not have enough knowledge in your mind to translate The answer is available to you.  This means that just flop on the sofa and become the smartest person will not work.  You have to work, work and work on yourself. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/6d2/7d5/600/6d27d5600ed7a96038529b8369dcbb5c.jpg"><br>  Perhaps this is one of the keys to your prosperity and development, perhaps another my delusion.  But having tried time, it is impossible to forget and score. <br><br>  Another item that was remembered from the first picture to the post is group dreams.  Clearly confirmed data for or against does not exist either.  Whether the author of the script, or a very high level of practice, but you can give an answer to this question. <br><br>  About the nesting and the depth of sleep, I can say this - if you go to sleep in a dream, you will be knocked out, because the phase will not allow you to relax.  I didn‚Äôt try it with the help of sleeping pills, but I don‚Äôt see any sense, the speed of the brain in the embedded sleep is unlikely to be different, therefore the time in the embedded sleep will not flow more slowly.  Although there is some truth in the film, too, because time seems more extended there.  But this is most likely due to the subjectivity of the perception of time - usually we count it from the events that have occurred, and in a dream the 10 minute walk turns into a millisecond movement, and such dream artifacts make their adjustments to the perception of time.  And to change the space, you can without any dreams - just closed your eyes, presented and opened in a new place (you will read about this method yourself). <br><br><h3>  Instead of output </h3><br>  I couldn‚Äôt tell about everything here, so that some things were left behind the scenes: these are methods of moving in space, and some methods of obtaining information.  Direct techniques are not fully covered, because the article is not of that level.  All this you can find in the original. <br>  The main question "To believe or not to believe" - ‚Äã‚Äãdo not believe.  I don't want someone stupidly believing.  This is a practice.  She is deprived of any philosophy for this allows anyone to use it.  These techniques do not require cash infusions or group classes.  I hope no one will make this a sect.  The case is purely individual. <br>  Well, probably all.  I do not know how long the fast and my karma will last, but hardly for a long time.  But at least I tried to tell about the possibilities of our brain from the point of view of practical application. <br><br>  PS Fasting is alive, for this I accept all amendments and supplements.  Just give without philosophy. <br>  Overclock - because this state raises the frequency of the brain (about 40 Hz). <br><br>  _______ <br><br>  Additions: <br>  1. I apologize for the turbidity of thought in the definition of this state.  All that is described is part of FBS (fast sleep phase) and does not go beyond it.  Hence, safety, since PBS is a natural process and you go through it every day, several times during sleep.  Please a little more attentive about conscious dreams.  This is only part of the phenomenon, I described another component of this phenomenon - indirect sleep techniques.  It is just a method of ‚Äúentering‚Äù, or, to be more exact, is the only trick for yourself that would be to catch your consciousness inside FBS. <br>  2. My big omission about children.  I just forgot to write. <br>  In children, this phenomenon manifests itself constantly.  They even sometimes do not need to learn (this confirms the naturalness of the process and its availability).  I have a request to all of you - if your child will say something like this, please at least do not suppress it.  May you not give him lessons and explanations, at least encourage him.  Let the child explore this in himself.  This will allow him to develop better and remove the problems of "vtyuhivaniya" from books and similar to my article.  The child himself will then be able to say that in the books is bullshit, and what he was doing himself. <br>  3. Many annoying "muddy" terminology.  I tried to get rid of the usual words, so that those who came across such descriptions, looked at it from a different angle, without labels in the mind.  But it didn‚Äôt work out very well, so please forgive my attempts. <br>  4. I do not like to leave things not finished, according to this I want to collect some statistics and in a couple of months to publish the results collected from Habr users. <br>  If you can write to me in a personal in the format: <br>  - How did you learn about the phenomenon, <br>  - Was there any experience before my posting, <br>  - What's happened, <br>  - Practical benefit for you personally, <br>  - What method do you use (can be a list of references), <br>  - Your attitude to this. <br><br>  I will accept it for a long time (I will wait for those who have only found out about it and will just start using it), I am waiting for everyone, including those who have tried it and failed.  If you can more technical form (Habr does not strongly favor the esoteric). <br>  Well, if you can NOT send such things: - I have not tried anything, I consider it dangerous, you went *** and all you like.  This I have already heard enough in the comments. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/219819/">https://habr.com/ru/post/219819/</a></p>
