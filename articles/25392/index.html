  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Analytical greetings: Russian hosting market, long-year observations.</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Today, exactly a year, as we put on the site the first news.  Of course, we drink to this business.  But now is not about that.  Now about the rapidly growing market of hosting services.  Namely, about my observations, which, naturally, are extremely subjective.  I collected the observations for the last 366 days, collected them specifically, and then shared them.  It just pleases me that a certain conditional "creche" period has been passed, and it may be useful for someone. <br><br>  Observation number one.  The market is oversaturated with "govnokompaniyami."  Rather, ‚Äúpseudocompanies‚Äù.  Collections of enthusiasts work without a legal entity, without an office, without, consider, responsibility to the client, without the desire and understanding of their own development and without, of course, the proper level of services.  Sometimes without any level at all.  This is a vile, in my opinion, a trend and it really bothers me, because the level of civilization in this market is not indifferent to me and, what is there, is important. <br><br>  Observation number two.  The ‚Äúgovnokontenta‚Äù market is very, very large.  Not even "pseudo-content", namely govnokokontenta, without quotes.  There are a lot of people who order virtual hosting services for spam, phishing and other rubbish.  This is followed by the technical complications of companies with the provision of a test free period and putting on three condoms in the matter of moneyback.

      Observation number three.  Quality is more important for the customer.  There are a lot of people who are ready to overpay a little for not running into Observation number one.  The ‚Äúagreements of intent‚Äù are really important for people: a contract for services, a license to operate, an office, where you can reach with your feet, and so on.  Clients from ‚Äúobservation number two‚Äù mostly want to work with vile and vile dumping - this is very nice. <br><br>  Observation number four, the last.  ‚ÄúYaselny‚Äù hosting, that is, a young company entering the market, feels gorgeous under two main conditions.  First: flexibility and readiness for dialogue with the client.  Willingness to discuss in the field of a package of services, while not confessing nonsense from the series "the customer is always right."  Second: the ‚Äúcr√®che‚Äù fast period really points to the inertia of large companies and argues in the opinion: ‚ÄúThere are so many customers who prefer to take services not from monsters of the market, due to‚Äú observation three ‚Äù.  Why the "monsters" did not take this into account in the period of their rapid "maturation", I personally do not understand.  But we will take into account. <br><br>  As a congratulations to all our customers, I say that in such a short period in this country, nobody in this market has done this development except for IO-HOSTS.  Neither by pace, nor by unrealistically low amount of negative reviews, nor by the degree of openness of the company to its customers (which is personally crucial for me).  That's really nobody.  And if there is a similar example of work in this market, then I will gladly agree with brainy analysts - soon everyone will have their own website, and not one. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/25392/">https://habr.com/ru/post/25392/</a></p>
