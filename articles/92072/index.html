      Within the framework of the institute, it was proposed to participate in one program dedicated to the creation or modernization of an international company website. <br><br>  The essence of the project was as follows: my team of 5 people had to carry out a set of works that fully reveal the essence of such giants as <b>‚ÄúApple‚Äù</b> - our main choice and <b>‚ÄúMicrosoft‚Äù</b> - the main competitor. <br><br>  The entire project was to be completed within two weeks using products such as Microsoft Project, Visio, Word, Power Point and Photoshop.  Project, as a product, of course, is not bad, but as a project manager I was not very comfortable with it, because I had to spend quite a significant part of my time on ‚Äútaming‚Äù this program. <br><br>  After ‚ÄúProject‚Äù, the whole project had to be transferred to ‚ÄúMicrosoft Visio‚Äù with full block division (fashion trends) for each of the main processes. <br><br>  <b>A small example:</b> <br><br><img src="http://img97.imageshack.us/img97/308/61527751.jpg" alt="image"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  As a result, all assigned tasks were equally distributed among all employees.  Each person was responsible for his part and for its competent and thorough implementation. <br><br>  <b>Tasks were of the following nature:</b> <br><ul><li>  The introductory part - a description of the two companies - the purpose of creation, activity, products, etc .; </li><li>  The theoretical part is W3C principles and standards.  We have chosen about 4 criteria for our site; </li><li>  ‚ÄúSWOT - analysis‚Äù - ‚Äúswatting‚Äù of the sites ‚ÄúApple‚Äù and ‚ÄúMicrosoft‚Äù; </li><li>  Changes to the site map; </li><li>  Design is the longest and most time-consuming task for the entire project period. </li></ul>  More I want to stay at two. <br><br>  <b>Let's start in order:</b> <br><ul><li>  ‚ÄúSWOT analysis‚Äù is an analysis of strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, Threats) <br>  The point is to understand what is good, what is bad on that and on the other site (based on the criteria that were chosen in the previous tasks). <br>  It was here that I first encountered the Microsoft Project issue - two employees didn‚Äôt complete the task by the deadline, and so I had to change the data in the program itself, and since everything was already there, everything literally floated - dates, days, and so on .d., had to "reconfigure" - a very long and tedious. <br>  As a result, on the basis of two SWOT analyzes for two companies, a general conclusion was written; </li><li>  There were no tasks to create a physical site - in general, the whole project implied the system of approach to the development of the site, using the available resources and the obtained data, based on theoretical material.  Therefore, we have proposed layouts of the pages of the site of the company "Apple", or rather three sections - "Home", "iPhone", "Mac". </li></ul><br>  Below I quote the resulting design of the sections <b>"Home", "iPhone" and "Mac"</b> : <br><br><img src="http://img687.imageshack.us/img687/4111/40053737.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="http://img411.imageshack.us/img411/3884/59486708.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="http://img687.imageshack.us/img687/4111/40053737.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Design took most of the time allotted to us, and, as a result, the project received the first place among 15 others.  He played the main role.  In general, the design was done by a person who had a rough idea of ‚Äã‚Äãwhat Photoshop is.  Nevertheless, all members of the ‚Äúhigh‚Äù jury: President of the NRNU MEPhI, Dean of the Faculty, etc.  - marked it as the most interesting, beautiful and competitive. <br><br>  At the end of the work I had compiled a summary for each of the members of the working group.  The project was noted and I, as a manager, received an invitation to work at the Department No. 65 - ‚ÄúAnalysis of Competitive Systems‚Äù (NRNU MEPI). <br><br>  And in the end, I would like to wish all novice managers and everyone who is interested in this field - do not be afraid and try to show yourself, show all your best qualities and skills. <br><br>  Good luck! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/92072/">https://habr.com/ru/post/92072/</a></p>
