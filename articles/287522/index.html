However, I believe that the overall picture is approximately similar to the results I received. <br><br>  Why am I sure people do not know about this?  I can‚Äôt say with great confidence, however, people on that side sometimes didn‚Äôt understand at all what a site was, and I had to explain what www was (well, such a double Roman number is five).  In each such case, I was told that the site was given to the promotion to some optimizers.  And what's going on - they do not know. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/3f4/401/f8c/3f4401f8c8736eea79f304b61f0882d7.jpg" alt="75% of site owners do not know that they are promoted by blog spam"><br>  Having a little talk with people, I realized that in all cases people bought at a small cost of optimization and promotion.  After I left the phone, the name and address of the site, spam stopped altogether.  I can not say why, perhaps the optimizers reported this call, and they excluded my address from this spam list, and maybe someone broke off relations with them.

      <br>
      Most of all, I don‚Äôt like that people are fooled without informing the details of optimization and promotion when concluding a contract.  How they are promoted and promoted, the site owners learned from me.  Some people were shocked by this - this is understandable, no one likes spam, except spammers. <br><br>  I kept statistics for three months, when an idea occurred to me to call a person, and ask me in the forehead - what the hell is he doing.  At first, I didn‚Äôt believe in the stories about some mysterious optimizers, who muddied something there themselves - but the mass character of such excuses made me think. <br><br>  However, exactly a quarter of the owners directly answered, saying yes - spamming, and what to do.  I did not want to enter into polemics and reasoning, and did not.  Most agreed to exclude me from spam lists, and indeed, spam no longer appears.  But, in fairness it should be noted, there were also those who sent me in plain text, absolutely not embarrassed by the fact that they were caught, in fact, red-handed. <br><br>  I strongly hope that the people with whom I spoke, will no longer be in trouble with optimizers, and in the future they will not spoil in my and your blog. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/287522/">https://habr.com/ru/post/287522/</a></p>
