  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Warm tube game: Warlords Classic for iOS</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  In the distant childhood I lived in the cold Norilsk.  In the winter, in fierce frosts, the Department of Public Education allowed "not to attend classes for students of the first shift ..." (countrymen will understand ...) - this was called "aktirovka".  In general, we studied a little, and on such days we had to stay at home.  But I had the opportunity to go to my mother to work at a design institute, where I could play an IBM PC compatible computer for an hour or two (here, -40 degrees with the wind is not a hindrance).  And the favorite game was <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warlords_(game_series)">Warlords</a> ... <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/008/00c/676/00800c6764e6eeb9568b0badd9d0afdc.jpg"><br><br>  <s><i>For gift codes you can contact in a personal.</i></s>  :( ended. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Years have passed (even decades), and I, an accomplished programmer, decided to write Warlords for the iPhone (the iPad was not yet ... 2009, autumn).  Everything would be fine, but I only had a couple of months of development experience for iOS, and I still didn‚Äôt understand all of the alloc / init / retain / release / autorelease magic.  This, however, did not stop me - two months of work (in fact, I now understand that this was training), and the game was ready (80% of the original features were implemented).  Deciding not to become impudent and 100%, leaving the map and graphics resources honestly cut from the DOS version, I released it in the AppStore under the name Knights (that is, I insoled 90% of the percentage).

      It took two weeks ... and in the mailbox was found a letter from Steve Fokner - the author of the original game of 1998 release, born in Australia, born in 1968.  In the letter I was promised courts of all instances, demanded to pay a penalty and immediately remove the game from the AppStore.  It turns out that Warlords fans found my game and began to write to Steve asking them to implement the missing functionality, to screw the multiplayer game, etc.  He later said that he was very surprised. <br><br>  I had nothing to do but to remove the game from the sale.  However, I gained courage and offered to release the same game under the original name, for the deduction of part of the profits.  And, lo and behold, Steve gladly agreed.  Now the AppStore is the official port.  Everyone has forgotten about the penalty, and now I am the owner of exclusive rights to the Warlords for iOS game for the next 5 years. <br><br>  Months flew by, the game was sluggishly sold, and I forgot about it.  Moreover, it was not possible to make changes in the ‚Äúsecond-order code noodle‚Äù.  I started other projects, upgrading my iOS-dev skills. <br><br>  And so, last spring it dawned on me!  We also have an iPad - a large and convenient iPhone, which is very suitable for playing Warlords on it.  Yes, and Apple released iOS 6 with Turn Based Games support (with a timeout of the turn) in the Game Center.  So you can realize a multiplayer game with a little blood. <br><br>  It was decided to rewrite from scratch, but with an eye on several cards and the game through the Game Center.  Oddly enough, but writing from scratch with a much larger amount of experience took the same two months.  Six months later, I made a universal application from an iPad game (it runs on both iPhone and iPad), after which sales have approximately doubled. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/757/54c/ff9/75754cff918463e55eedcb2094144c27.jpg"><br><br>  Now there are three cards in the game - the classic Illuria, Hadash of Warlords 2 and, a figment of my imagination, Krylantis.  The game brings its own "penny", pleases the fans, and makes my wife angry, when I, lying in bed, make regular moves against already familiar rivals. <br><br>  With the help of a written editor, I continue to create (well ... port) maps from Warlords 2 and Warlords 2 Deluxe.  People like it.  All new cards are absolutely free, although users have written more than once that they are willing to pay.  I believe that the current price of $ 5 is quite adequate and deserves to continue work on my part without charging additional fees.  In the autumn, Erythea and Isladia are expected with graphics already from WL2 Deluxe. <br><br>  Positive feedback and an honest rating of 4.5 stars in the AppStore are very satisfying.  I get special pleasure by drawing the boards of the Russ for each new card: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/f86/a7f/125/f86a7f125f742638099946451f23bb9f.jpg"><br><br>  Join us and you: <br>  iTunes AppStore: <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/ru/app/id532024361">itunes.apple.com/ru/app/id532024361</a> <br>  Facebook: <a href="http://www.facebook.com/WarlordsGame">www.facebook.com/WarlordsGame</a> <br><br>  And finally, some information for fellow developers. <br><br>  Downloads by country are as follows (the game is fully translated into a dozen languages): <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/309/e9e/860/309e9e860c539f4eb0fb2feecaff924f.png"><br><br>  Recently, I published an article <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/171975/">Increase profits from iOS apps three times.</a>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/171975/">No progress, just a technique ...</a> , in which he ‚Äúproved‚Äù the dependence of the number of downloads of a free application (and therefore the income from conversion) on the size of the application.  Now I can say with confidence that for paid applications "this locomotive does not fly."  Reducing the size of Warlords Classic from 32 to 9 MB did not affect sales. <br><br>  I admit that the implementation for the iPhone is not very successful - everything is small and inconvenient, i.e.  ported almost "simple reduction".  However, you have the opportunity to make your move in the allotted 24 hours, even if the relatives took the iPad for a couple of days.  Perhaps I will correct the situation.  Someday. <br><br>  <s>Ps.</s>  <s>I have 50 gift codes.</s>  <s>Tell me, do not prohibit the rules Habr their distribution here?</s> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/187478/">https://habr.com/ru/post/187478/</a></p>
