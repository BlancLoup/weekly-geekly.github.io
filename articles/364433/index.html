  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The Pirate Bay may be back</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><h3>  Police raid did not scare resource operators </h3><br> <a href="http://https:"><img src="//habrastorage.org/files/602/0e9/a34/6020e9a34e334fc09d19943ec6f42727.jpg" align="left"></a>  After the cessation of the work of The Pirate Bay, the administration of the most rebellious torrent site of the galaxy retained unprecedented silence.  This is somewhat strange, given the seriousness of the situation - it was reported on the raid of the Swedish police, seizure of equipment and even arrest. <br><br>  Now, finally, there is a statement from the site operators.  Portal TorrentFreak <a href="https://torrentfreak.com/pirate-bay-crew-responds-to-the-raid-copies-and-the-future-141215/">posted a</a> message that the owners of the resource are still weighing options, but do not yet have clear plans to return. <br><br>  Comments were given by someone who called himself Mr 10100100000. If we take this sequence as a number in the binary number system and convert it into decimal, then we get 1312. It is possible that this is a hint of a date. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  A representative of Pirate Bay declared that the raid was perceived only as part of the game.  The police visit was not at all surprised by the site operators.

      Now the administration uses the resulting gap as a break.  They are trying to understand how long they should continue their activities, for what all this is done.  In addition, they were interested to see how ordinary users would react to offline care. <br><br>  There were no specific reasons for not returning to service.  Mr 10100100000 says that operators are not sure whether The Pirate Bay will resume work, but if there is a return, it will take place with fanfare. <br><br>  It is stated that the whole team of the Pirate Bay, including moderators, is 30-50 people from all over the world without a clear leader.  Obviously, they are actively discussing how to proceed. <br><br>  Recently, due to the persistence of the urgent need to download content from somewhere without having to pay for it, several copies of The Pirate Bay have appeared, and <a href="https://geektimes.ru/post/242985/">some not only mirror, but also create their own distributions</a> . <br><br>  The administration of the resource does not see anything wrong with this, although it warns about the need for careful attitude to attempts to deceive users.  Some recommendations about the preferred mirror were not given - the best is offered to the Network itself. <br><br>  If the site was bad, then hardly anyone would try to copy it.  The resource lives on the principles of copying, which makes it something more than just a bunch of data on a dusty machine in the data center. <br><br>  The Pirate Bay is the largest and most popular bittorient site, which has been an example of disobedience to the will of the right holders for over 10 years.  His whole existence is connected with constant legal persecution and political activity.  Before the raid last week, he never "lay" more than three days. <br><br>  On the morning of December 9, the <a href="https://geektimes.ru/post/242723/">site stopped working</a> .  In the evening, it became known about the raid of the Swedish police, it was reported about the seized servers and computers, as well as at least one arrest. <br><br>  Together with The Pirate Bay, EZTV, Torrage, Zoink, Istole and Suprbay.org have gone offline.  For a long time <a href="https://geektimes.ru/post/242542/">,</a> the largest tracker in the world, OpenBitTorrent, is <a href="https://geektimes.ru/post/242542/">not working</a> , perhaps all these events are interrelated. <br><br>  Co-founder of ‚ÄúPirate Bay‚Äù Peter Sunde <a href="https://geektimes.ru/post/242771/">expressed confidence</a> that it would be better if the site closes forever.  He said that the new team is not very enthusiastic, and the site has lost the value of the ideas being protected, and it is better for users to try to create something new from scratch. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/364433/">https://habr.com/ru/post/364433/</a></p>
