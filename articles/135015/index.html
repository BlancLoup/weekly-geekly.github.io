The inability to adapt the ECM system to the needs and requirements of a particular organization. <br>  2. Failure to meet the specific deadlines: the implementation of ECM solutions usually takes more time than originally thought. <br>  3. The inability to meet the framework of the planned budget. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The question arises: what are the main reasons for these failures?  What can be done to avoid them? <br>  It seems that the failures in the implementation of ECM solutions are due to eight main reasons:

      1. <i>Insufficient attention to the adaptation of the system to the specifics of a particular organization</i> .  Introducing new programs, organizations often care little about the simplicity and ease of use.  This problem has two dimensions.  On the one hand, it is necessary to make sure that most users have access to the ECM system and are able to work with it.  On the other hand, a critical mass of content should be available in the system.  If none of the above conditions are met, the system is almost impossible to adapt to the systems of a particular organization.  In addition to the number of users and the volume of hosted content, special attention should be paid to ease of use.  If the user experiences difficulties while working with the system, which he did not experience when working with paper documents, he will avoid working with this system. <br><br>  <b>Recommendation</b> : focus on increasing the number of users and increasing the amount of content stored in the system.  Try to do everything possible to ensure that work with the system is simple and convenient. <br><br>  2. <i>Choosing the wrong business scenario</i> .  Many organizations start working with ECM based on the wrong business scenario.  Only scenarios that guarantee high payback and long-term performance can serve as evidence of the benefits of an ECM system. <br><br>  <b>Recommendation</b> Rely on business scenarios that: (1) have obvious prospects;  (2) lead to significant cost savings and in which (3) ECM solutions are a key component, not just an additional tool. <br><br>  3. <i>Excess customization</i> .  Consulting company Doculabs conducted a study of more than 500 organizations that occupy a variety of activities (scientific, financial, administrative, commercial, etc.).  Very rarely, representatives of these organizations agreed that their activities were no different from the activities of their counterparts.  Much more often we hear about <i>unique</i> moments in the activities of organizations than about typical ones.  Practice shows that excessive fixation on the unique leads to failures in the implementation of ECM-solutions.  No need to strive to ensure that the ECM-system meets the requirements and wishes for 100%.  70% is enough.  This moment seems quite obvious, but at the same time very few people pay attention to it. <br><br>  <b>Recommendation</b> .  Avoid excessive customization.  The goal of ECM should rather be to simplify typical operations. <br><br>  4. <i>Erroneous understanding of the ECM implementation process</i> .  Very often, the introduction of an ECM system is considered as a one-step and long-term (on average 12 - 15 months) process.  Too long a period of time between the formation of system requirements and implementation is typical for many organizations. <br><br>  <b>Recommendation</b> .  Work on the implementation and maintenance of the system should be a continuous process. <br><br>  5. <i>Insufficiently reasoned justification for the need for ECM for business</i> .  Very often one has to deal with the fact that insufficient attention is paid to calculating the payback of ECM solutions.  Financial justifications are often deliberately optimistic (and therefore cannot be taken seriously), or are too general, and therefore cannot be analyzed with respect to a particular organization. <br>  6. <i>Insufficient attention to usability issues</i> .  Many ECM systems could be more popular if they were not so inconvenient to use. <br><br>  <b>Recommendation</b> .  Pay more attention to user experience.  When developing a system, create prototypes showing how user conditions will improve after its implementation. <br><br>  7. <i>Too narrow understanding of ECM issues</i> .  To implement and successfully use an ECM solution, it is necessary to know the theoretical and methodological foundations of working with information in the broadest sense.  Lack of strategy and inattention to methodological issues also leads to disastrous results. <br><br>  <b>Recommendation</b> .  Do not neglect the theoretical side of the issue.  In the modern era of rapidly changing technologies, it is difficult to find an effective ECM solution without being well-versed in the field of theory and methodology. <br><br>  8. <i>Insufficient attention to change management issues</i> .  ECM as a field of knowledge and practical activity has been around for a long time.  However, when implementing an ECM solution in an organization, it is necessary to take into account not only <i>what</i> is being implemented, but also <i>how</i> it is being done.  People get used to working in a certain mode and hardly switch to something new, no matter how profitable and effective it is.  If you do not prepare employees of the organization for innovation in advance, there may be numerous problems. <br><br>  <b>Recommendation</b> .  Before automating workflow and document storage, develop a clear change management strategy. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/135015/">https://habr.com/ru/post/135015/</a></p>
