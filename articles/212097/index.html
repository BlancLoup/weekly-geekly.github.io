  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Electronics manufacturing in China - what to expect?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Sooner or later, any ‚Äúelectronic‚Äù project either dies (as an option, it falls into a coma ‚Äúuntil better times‚Äù), or it matures to the ‚Äúpilot production‚Äù stage.  Those.  from the units assembled ‚Äúon the knee‚Äù it comes time to switch to the production of a hundred or two, and maybe even thousands of devices.  And here it turns out that on the territory of our immense Motherland with this all oh how difficult. <br>  What does a modern electronic device consist of?  This is one or more mounted printed circuit boards, housing and accessories (cables, antennas, etc.).  What adventures are waiting for us on this path? <br>  <b>1. It is necessary to make the circulation of printed circuit boards.</b>  There are usually two problems here: small circulation and manufacturing complexity.  With a small circulation, few people want to get involved (in fact, all roads traditionally lead to Rezonit), and the prices for such circulations are usually extremely inhumane.  But if suddenly your board falls into the category of "high-tech" (tm), i.e.  Since it is multi-layered (6 or more layers), and even with cunning micro-holes (for example, HDI), then it becomes somehow very difficult to find a performer in Russia. <br>  <b>2. It is necessary to find components in the required quantities.</b>  Well, everything is as usual here - expensive and not always available in principle.  Here, for example, we just encountered a certain shortage of white LEDs from Cree of the nominal value we need ... We collected literally 2-3 pieces in different offices. <br>  <b>3. Surface mounting</b> on the run in 100-1000 boards.  Only the cost of setting up an SMD machine (if someone really takes on such a ‚Äútrifle‚Äù) makes this process extremely non-budget. <br>  <b>4. Manufacturing of the case.</b>  The body is usually plastic - i.e.  options are available (in the usual order of increasing price per unit) printing on a 3D printer, production on a CNC machine, silicone casting or conventional casting (under pressure).  In any case - the same problems as with printed circuit boards: it is expensive and hard to find a performer for a small circulation. <br>  Like many others before us, our company in its time came close to solving all these problems.  And we began to solve them with the help of Chinese factories.  To whom this method of solving some problems and acquiring others is interesting - welcome under cat. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Cooperation with the Chinese helps to solve some problems, but at the same time adds a few others.  So let's consider them in order. <br><br><h5>  1. Search for artists. </h5><br>  Here you have three options.  Search the Internet, visit an exhibition or intermediary services.  The first two demonstrate obvious risks, of which the main ones are communication problems.  It is unlikely that you will communicate with Chinese in Chinese, Russian is practically irrelevant, and English is not native to you or to them.  So it is quite possible misunderstanding, which translates into technical errors.  Well, about the features of working with intermediaries, and so everyone knows.  By the way, if the Chinese on the other side speaks English - most likely this is the intermediary, only it carefully conceals it.  Now, if any Chinese girl speaks with you in Russian, it is likely that this is a large factory that specifically employs Russian-speaking (well, as they themselves think) staff.  In any case, you will have to pay a little extra for the pleasure of communicating in an understandable language (whether it is Russian or English), this will be taken into account in the final quota (quotation is a ‚Äúcommercial offer‚Äù that describes all the conditions on the part of the performer).

      <br>
    <h5>  2. Contract and money transfer. </h5><br>  The contract with the Chinese to conclude, in general, is not a problem.  Problems begin when the opposite side does not want to abide by it (well, or so you think so, at least).  Just think - what, in fact, can you do if the money is transferred and the goods are not delivered to you or (which is much worse in terms of judicial prospects) is delivered, but not the one that is defective, etc.?  In general, it can be said that even a competently drawn up and properly executed contract of a Russian enterprise with a Chinese one does not give any guarantees, alas. <br>  If the Chinese side is ready to accept money from you via Western Union for a private person, this is a bell.  This, of course, not guaranteed kidalovo, but the chances are great.  In addition, the WU specifically asks you in the process to confirm that the translation is non-commercial, and it is not good to deceive.  Reputable companies prefer to work according to the T / T scheme (electronic money transfer to the company account).  The bill, of course, in China, and not a ruble.  So for such a translation you at least need to have a legal entity.  the person, the currency account and a properly executed foreign trade contract.  But the legal translation carries the minimum amount of costs.  Well, just in case: if the amount of deliveries under the contract exceeds 50,000 USD, then it will be necessary to issue a ‚Äúpassport of the transaction‚Äù (no big deal, if you do not forget to do everything on time).  In general, all foreign exchange transactions should be monitored very carefully, since fines are draconian (up to 100% of the contract amount). <br><br><h5>  3. Quality control. </h5><br>  Rarely when you get it right the first time.  Immediately prepare yourself for a visual demonstration of the justice of popular wisdom "the first pancake is lumpy."  The first contract with this contractor, the first batch of goods, communication problems, the contractor‚Äôs weak interest in a small contract ‚Äî all this simply cannot but lead to serious difficulties.  There are only two options to reduce the risks: either you fly to China and control the process, or hire someone else.  In China, there is a whole industry of special "independent checkers", at exhibitions they usually have a couple of dozen stands at a minimum. <br><br><h5>  4. Delivery to Russia. </h5><br>  The usual way is by plane.  Because electronics, and even a small circulation - it is something light, compact and quite expensive.  Delivery of one kg of cargo from Shenzhen or Hong Kong to Moscow - 5-6 USD (if at least 100 kilograms will reach 100, if less - it will be more expensive, of course).  If your products are packed in cardboard boxes, you can get to the volumetric weight (relatively speaking, the carriage of a box in volume per cubic meter, but weighing 1 kg, doesn‚Äôt cost as a transport of 1 kg).  But quickly.  3-4 days - and the goods are already in Moscow.  Alternative - land or sea.  The land can also be different - by car through Kazakhstan or by rail through Vladivostok, for example.  Due to the peculiarities of Russian logistics, the railway usually turns out to be more expensive than an airplane (although it is even slower than a car).  But there is a special category of goods, for which in most cases it is necessary to use channels along the ground - these are lithium batteries. <br>  A separate line can be mentioned express delivery services.  From China to Russia, they work only with Russian legal entities.  individuals alas.  For sending samples (ie up to 5 pieces of one article and total cost, including delivery, less than 200 euros), the best option is FedEx.  Fast and inexpensive.  If a ‚Äúconsignment‚Äù is typed, i.e.  more than 5 pcs.  and / or more than 200 euros (but it is extremely desirable - not more than 1000 euros for preferential rates for brokerage services), then you will have to load the goods.  And here we must focus on DHL or UPS, which have their own brokerage services at relatively reasonable rates. <br><br><h5>  5. Customs clearance. </h5><br>  If you carry yourself on your contract, most likely you will need broker services (if your company itself is engaged in customs clearance of goods - why are you reading this article?).  The pleasure is quite expensive, especially when you consider that customs will have to be at the airport.  In Sheremetyevo, for example, the usual ‚Äútax‚Äù is from 1000 USD for one customs declaration, plus overhead costs (payment for warehouse services, etc.) and, of course, all customs payments.  Fortunately, in most cases the duty on electronics (in the form of assembled printed circuit boards with or without a housing) is zero, but there is, alas, 18% import VAT.  To customs clearance - you need to submit a bunch of documents, do not forget.  It is best to agree on a list before the shipment departs from China.  For if some piece of paper is not enough - the cargo will fall on the temporary storage warehouse (temporary storage warehouse, a very expensive pleasure), and you will get a considerable charge of vivacity.  It is especially funny if it suddenly turns out that there is a lack of a certificate of conformity with the TR CU or notification of the FSB (these papers are issued at least two weeks).  So be careful. <br>  If some express delivery service delivers the goods to you, then only one thing changes for you: a separate contract with the broker is not required.  The set of documents remains the same.  The cost will also be more or less the same in both cases (if you yourself - then cheap delivery plus expensive broker, if DHL or UPS - then expensive delivery plus cheap brokerage services). <br>  And, of course, there are <i>alternative</i> ways of delivery, in which you will not need any customs clearance efforts.  I do not recommend such methods to you (what are you, what are you, how can you?!), But just in case: the cost of delivering electronics by such channels usually varies from 12 to 30 USD / kg, and the terms vary from a week to a month.  Those who really want to - he will find. <br><br><hr><br>  Well, something so briefly.  I do not pretend to absolute truth, but my experience is very real.  He decided to post the article right now, because the Chinese (finally!) Left their New Year holidays and got to work.  Hooray! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/212097/">https://habr.com/ru/post/212097/</a></p>
