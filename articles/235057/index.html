And I want to bring to your attention the adaptation of the lecture in Habrapublication, as well as a short story about the technical aspects and software that was used in the preparation and display. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  Origins of the idea </h4><br>  If you want to go straight to the presentation materials and not read about its origin and technical aspects, <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/235057/">click here</a> . <br>  There is such a wonderful person ‚Äî <a href="http://vk.com/shaenko">Alexander Shaenko</a> ‚Äî the developer of space technology, who created the <a href="http://vk.com/your_sector_of_space">‚ÄúYour Sector of the Cosmos‚Äù</a> community and read popular science lectures on astronautics.  Initially, lectures were given in Moscow, but in the summer, Alexander had the idea to travel across Russia from Moscow to Kamchatka, giving lectures along the way.  Literally the other day, the project ‚ÄúSpace from the Sea to the Sea‚Äù was successfully completed in the village of Vulkannoye not far from Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky. <br>  I learned about this project by chance, when Alexander was already in Yekaterinburg.  Moreover, Ufa, in any case, was not in terms of movement.  It seems that one could start to get upset - lectures passed us by.  On the other hand, I had the idea to read such a lecture myself.  Still, I write non-fiction publications on Habr, and worked as a teacher for a long time, lecturing is a familiar and familiar affair.  I contacted Alexander, he not only did not object, but also offered to take as a base his lectures <a href="https://yadi.sk/d/jBOchxKIFUNvR">posted in the public domain</a> .  The first lecture should have a minimum threshold of entry, so the topic "The Beauty of the Cosmos" was very suitable.  I reworked the material quite strongly, removing quotations from science fiction works and expanding the direction of the narration - instead of moving ‚Äúfrom space to Earth‚Äù it turned out ‚Äúfrom Earth to space‚Äù. <br><br><h4>  Technical aspects </h4><br>  I have not done a presentation for a long time, so the possibility of adding a video has become for me some news.  Talking about beauty is great with video, so this was good news.

      The next was a question of reproducing the presentation.  It‚Äôs still inconvenient to imprison a trained person‚Äôs computer and command him: ‚ÄúNext slide, please‚Äù.  Ideally, the presenter should be able to independently switch to any slide in the presentation.  At the same time, it is better for the speaker to stand, so the option to sit at the computer and press buttons, controlling the presentation, is also bad.  Therefore, I spent some time exploring the possibility of managing the presentation from a smartphone, since the big screen and high performance of Galaxy Note 3 made this idea very promising. <br><br>  The first idea of ‚Äã‚Äãmanaging a presentation device directly from a smartphone was unsuccessful.  The possibility of wireless synchronization of the screens of the smartphone and the TV, promised by the manufacturer, has broken about the absence of compatible TVs with this technology.  The idea of ‚Äã‚Äãwireline communication required an HDMI adapter, not to mention the inconvenience of a wired connection for a gesticulating and moving lecturer.  The same problems concerned projectors.  The situation was aggravated by software problems - there is good software on the smartphone that supports video in the presentation (POLARIS Office Viewer, included in the basic software), which, however, could not reproduce ODP presentations.  And the attempt to export ODP presentations to PPTX caused the video to disappear. <br><br>  In the process of finding software that could cope with the task, I came across the software <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details%3Fid%3Dorg.libreoffice.impressremote">‚ÄúLibreOffice Impress Remote‚Äù</a> from the developers of LibreOffice, which makes the phone a remote control for a computer with a presentation.  This option was the best - the computer connects to the projector, and the smartphone connects via WiFi or Bluetooth to the computer and controls the presentation.  The bonus is the ability to display notes on the smartphone screen as tips for the demonstration and emulation of the pointer.  According to the results of the lecture, I am pleased with the chosen method of display. <br>  The only problem that has emerged is the high demands on computer resources.  The presentation of the video turned out to be about 500 MB, and on a weak computer, inexplicable freezes, glitches and crashes rained down.  On the more powerful computer used for the lecture, the error appeared only once, just in time to announce the break. <br><br>  I hope my experience will be useful to you when creating your presentations. <br><a name="begin"></a><br><h4>  Beauty of the cosmos </h4><br>  Cosmos is firmly established in our lives.  Satellites provide communications, TV, Internet, navigation, and Earth sounding.  On the ISS, the crew moves forward science and helps the national economy.  Automatic interplanetary stations provide us with information about what is happening on other planets.  But besides all this space is also beautiful.  Space technology is beautiful engineering excellence.  On the ISS, satellites, and AMC there are cameras that give us the opportunity to look at the cosmic beauty. <br><br><h5>  Rockets </h5><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/xI98Tz1WmBM%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700021,15700186,15700190,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhjBmWSMWycKBb0bWQp9SgAiSexH2Q" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  It seems to be the usual launch of a conventional Soyuz launch vehicle.  If you do not think that at the start, thirty-two combustion chambers synchronously operate at a temperature from which the metal is melted, and only special engineering solutions protect the engines from destruction.  The control system maintains an unstable balance for nine minutes (try to hold the pencil vertically on your finger for nine minutes!) And offline, using acceleration data and steering angles, it provides the highest accuracy (try driving your car with your eyes closed for nine minutes and go to the garage , 0.5 cm larger than your car!). <br><br>  And in the next video camera put on a rocket of the same type, for the first time in 57 years of flights of carrier rockets of the R-7 family.  The separation of the four side blocks of the first stage and the opening of the drain valve of the third stage after separation are very beautiful. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/vHWDNrrfhnI%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700021,15700186,15700190,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhgdgbjgqLmvCDlTtaCPON-OpsRwAA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  In general, in space, almost any release of liquid or gas looks very beautiful.
