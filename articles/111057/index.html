  <section class="page js-page"><h1>IT in preschool and (partially) school education</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Here many times they wrote about how things are going with the IT infrastructure in universities.  Something skipped about schools.  Nobody wrote about kindergartens.  And there, too, there are computers with which to work.  In my article, I will describe the state of information technology in kindergartens and a little school grabbing (because the topics intersect). <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  My acquaintance with this area began with the fact that I got a job as a computer engineer in the education department two years ago.  What I began to see from the first days of work put me into a deep depression, in which I have been since.  I will try to describe the points. <br><br><h4>  Iron </h4><br>  Without exaggeration, I can say that I have seen computers of all ages.  Both from the new in the boxes from the store, and those that, in my opinion, were produced before my birth.  And the last, unfortunately most.  I hope you already guessed that on these computers there are operating systems not lower than WinXP.  Accordingly, the performance of these machines each year tends to zero.  It got to the point that in one garden I managed to drink a large mug of tea and cookies while I was loading the computer.  And not only downloads.  Performing any task hung him for 5-7 minutes.  So, as you understand, I drank a lot of tea. <br>  In my practice, collecting one working computer out of two or three non-working (you feel like a necromancer), and replacing some internal parts (once even the hard drive power wires were cut, still do not know who is to blame), and the statement death "patients." <br>  This is in kindergartens.  In schools, everything is more cheerful.  Getting under many federal programs provided them with more or less new computers.  Occasionally even productive.  BUT!  Since all equipment is purchased by tender, which are often won by dubious companies, the service life of such machines is not great.  I personally wrote off half the motherboards from computer classes, which only slightly survived the warranty period. <br><br><h4>  Software </h4><br>  There is total darkness here.  Only that part of the gardens that purchased computers for the last 3-4 years has the license axes (of course, the OEM version).  Of all the rest of the software, only what was purchased at once for the whole city is licensed.  About these programs below.  Antiviruses ... oh, it would be nice if they were at least pirated - they are simply absent.  The first three months of work I had one task - to clean viruses from all computers.  CureIt almost became my brother :) I met viruses of all modifications, versions, difficulties and production dates.  By the number of my record - 2536 viruses on one machine.  What is the saddest thing is that viruses are spread not only by garden workers, but also by the RONO.  The ‚Äúcentral node‚Äù of education also shares its viruses with its ‚Äúbranches‚Äù as well. <br>  In schools, in this regard, the full buzz.  Licensed software on all computers;  offices, antiviruses, development environments (!) and so on.  The federal program, after all! <br>  Now a little more about the special programs purchased for the whole city.  This is a terrible horror and darkness!  With all due respect to any brothers, developers, well, you can not write like that !!! <br>  It has its own data management program, staff and students (including kindergarteners) of the institution, the ‚ÄúParagraph‚Äù is called.  They wrote it, if I'm not mistaken, in Belarus.  The first question: "Why not Russian development?".  The program is a maximum at the diploma level of a programmer, and even course work.  The second question: ‚ÄúWhy is everything so done?‚Äù The person responsible for filling the database once a month unloads all the data into a special file, which then sends or carries on a flash drive to the district education department.  There, all the ‚Äúbasques‚Äù from all institutions are brought together in a single database.  Moreover, if an error occurs during import, they call the kindergarten or school and ask to correct some data.  Then you need to bring again or send a special file to the area.  If an error occurs again, the steps are repeated to infinity.  And errors occur constantly, because no verification of the input data is performed on client applications.  For example: if in the field you can enter only a line of the form: ‚ÄúPre-school ‚Ññ28‚Äù, where only numbers can change, then it is quite possible to enter ‚Äú123 leg-foot # $%‚Äù there.  And no one will say anything :) <br>  After converting the bases in the area, the same thing happens at the city level.  In general, by the time the base is reduced around the city, a new month begins in kindergartens, in which it is necessary to export again, etc. <br>  There are other things.  A treasury program that requires a computer that is not connected to the Internet and with a dial-up modem.  The program for the state.  procurement, which requires a digital signature (Crypto Pro, by the way).  But the problem is, this digital signature is neither installed nor configured adequately.  And, what is most interesting, you can only put it on XP or Vista, and those who already have the seven must pay for the new version of the program from their pocket. <br>  In general, the darkness.

    <h4>  the Internet </h4><br>  Well, there's a song here.  If someone is bored with Dial-Up, then he can safely come and nostalgic.  Almost all the kindergartens still sit on it (because the tender for the Internet was won by someone who was painfully clever and greedy).  This is despite the fact that the number of letters arriving daily is at least 20 pieces (like a little, but as long as you open everything, you want someone to break through the skull).  And a small bonus, in the form of updates for programs of 5 MB in size, also sent to the post office, makes you nervous, because at any second there can be a disconnect - and start over. <br>  Heads of gardens richer buy Megaphone / MTS / Beeline modems that are paid out of their pockets.  Because  can not pay from the budget of the garden - double funding!  they already have internet!  why the second? <br>  In schools, fame Cthulhu, dedicated lines.  That's just sometimes there is a network layout, which resembles a ball of worms.  In one place I spent about a week on drawing the routing table.  There was a death of Kashcheyev in general - the router is connected to the router, one more to two, those to two more.  Somewhere could even stand a hub. <br><br><h4>  Technical Literacy </h4><br>  On this point it is expected.  Everywhere there are ‚Äúshaitan-machines‚Äù, which are ‚ÄúPip-piiip‚Äù and ‚ÄúZhuu-Zhuuu‚Äù, ‚ÄúAnd here it‚Äôs bam, and everything does not work!‚Äù.  There are some courses <s>without</s> literacy that do not help. <br>  Incidentally, I happened to lead one.  An order came from above: ‚ÄúEach garden has its own website.‚Äù  Who will do them, how, when - no one was interested.  I had to teach 12 people at least something.  A prerequisite is that the software on which the site will be made should be free (you understand that the teachers did not write websites in a notebook).  The only WYSIWYG editor that I could then find and deliver was NVU.  That somehow worked on it.  But there are more gardens than 12!  The result of the federal program: two-thirds of the sites on the People, made the same by the people's editor, most of the remaining part on Yukoz, and part on normal hosting, more or less adequate looking, made to order, but absolutely not supported, due to lack of knowledge. <br>  Well, the authorities also burn.  My immediate superior, the head of the department of informatization of education in the district, really understands much less in the application software.  So there is no special authority. <br><br><h4>  Situation for the current day </h4><br>  Now everything slowly begins to straighten out for the better.  Gardens are seeking some funds to buy new equipment, or receive grants for its purchase. <br>  Two years ago, an agreement was signed with the provider to change the Dial-Up Internet to dedicated lines.  But, as usual, there was a crisis, and the provider froze the work for an indefinite period.  So far, nothing much has changed. <br>  From January they promise to make a single supply of licensed software for the gardens (including antiviruses).  Finally, they will stop bringing all kindergarten managers under criminal liability.  But, given the situation with the Internet, I‚Äôm not very encouraging yet. <br>  <i>A few words about STR.</i>  Seeing the level of computer literacy, I look forward with horror to the day when everyone will be transferred to Linux.  I think that on the same day, I will put a letter of resignation, because I will not be able to explain every step and work in my work.  So in this case I am categorically opposed to open source software.  Better pay Uncle Billy than my psychiatrist. <br><br><h4>  Epilogue </h4><br>  And so that you will be completely scared to tell you two amazing facts: <br><ul><li>  For 36 hour working week I get 7200 rubles.  (it saves the fact that the authorities do not touch, and I can work at a convenient time for me, and for the rest work on "normal" work for "normal" money) </li><li>  I work not somewhere in the outback.  And in one of the districts of St. Petersburg. </li></ul><br>  Thanks for attention. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/111057/">https://habr.com/ru/post/111057/</a></p>
