This is a new blog platform for optimizing recruitment potok.  For about 3 years now we have been following the market for HR technologies in Russia.  We are not only watching, we are trying to change it. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/80b/dc5/a71/80bdc5a7135a4812b883ec02faa89e60.png"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  You are probably already familiar with one of our projects.  <a href="http://icanchoose.ru/">icanchoose</a> is an HR-branded platform for companies that are ready to talk about their culture and team in order to attract new employees who share their values. <br><br>  And <a href="http://potok.io/">potok</a> is a new platform for optimizing recruitment.  We came to this not by chance, watching how teams of different companies cope with the process of hiring new employees, as well as how recruitment is changing: the influence of social media, the development of mobile tools, automation, teamwork and data, data, data.

      All this is in potok'e.  But this article is not about him, but about HR-technologies, the interest in which from the side of investors and companies of the most different scale grows every year.  Indicative statistics: the total volume of investments in HR-tools in 2013 amounted to $ 659 million, and in 2015 already $ 2.4 billion (in 2016 - $ 2.295 billion).  Of course, deals are made primarily in the United States and also in China. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b72/2c1/a3a/b722c1a3a89549588ad9c644437182c2.jpg"><br><br>  The number of companies and startups involved in HR-technologies is growing in the same progression. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/0ba/37e/d7f/0ba37ed7fd9c4d4fa5e3c44d54f917bb.jpg"><br><br>  This infographic shows that each of the products is dedicated to solving one of the tasks and problems in the field of HR, or the development and digitalization of one of the existing processes.  We will talk about one of the startups in each of these categories (well, almost - some are still relevant only for the US, for example), which we follow: <br><br>  <b>// Career Development / Coaching</b> <br><br>  <a href="https://www.zugata.com/">Zugata</a> , <a href="https://www.geteverwise.com/">Everwise</a> , <a href="https://landit.com/">Landit</a> , <a href="https://latticehq.com/">Lattice</a> - all these are platforms for perfomance management. <br>  They allow companies to work with employees, creating unique development plans for them and motivating them to solve various tasks. <br><br>  <a href="https://latticehq.com/">Lattice:</a> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/73e/109/254/73e109254db64114baf9081b7c567286.png"><br><br>  Service for those who want to review their approach to performance review.  This is convenient for employees - they answer questions when they have time, using a convenient and stylish platform.  The system also helps to collect feedback from your employees on any issues - for example, you wanted to tell Fyodor that his presentation was fire !, and wrote him a message.  Even in Lattice, employees can set goals and monitor their implementation with the team.  Colleagues directly in the system conduct an individual weekly Q &amp; A session to keep in touch and always know what is troubling each individual employee.  In general, an excellent platform to engage employees and monitor their motivation. <br><br>  <b>// Workplace culture</b> <br><br>  <a href="https://www.perkbox.com/uk/">Perkbox</a> , <a href="https://anyperk.com/">Anyperk</a> , <a href="http://www.cybergrants.com/">CyberGrants</a> - services that allow you to influence the working culture in the company through the creation of certain incentive systems.  Such systems allow you to engage employees in work, as well as to use non-material motivation (some services are aimed at nurturing the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãsocial responsibility among employees). <br><br>  <a href="https://anyperk.com/">Anyperk:</a> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/5ac/ae3/0f0/5acae30f01564217a59e29c117fd7cab.png"><br><br>  Creating the right motivation system for employees is as important as finding the right candidates.  That is why AnyPerk created a service for analyzing and selecting bonuses that will be of interest to your company's employees.  The creators of the company argue that it is the reward system that can positively influence the corporate spirit and the productivity of the team.  It seems wonderful to give people choices and motivate them. <br><br>  <b>// Tech Hiring:</b> <br><br>  All these startups are designed for sourcing specialists in the field of IT, as well as screening their skills.  Such platforms still appear - they are insanely important, because the search for IT specialists is no longer just a search, but war. <br><br>  <a href="https://amazinghiring.ru/">AmazingHiring:</a> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/4d7/d79/abc/4d7d79abc962450699436325c8b5cc1a.png"><br><br>  This startup is not in infographics, but we want to tell you about it - the guys from Russia created it.  AmazingHiring searches across multiple sources and collects the profiles of IT specialists in one place: online activity, work history, GitHub profile.  The system creates ‚Äúcards‚Äù with all the candidate's data, evaluates his professionalism with the help of the algorithms embedded in the system, and also collects the data of even those candidates who are not very widely represented in social media.  In short, IT-magic. <br><br>  <b>// Hiring graduates:</b> <br><br>  Platforms for posting vacancies (and even entire internship programs) for graduates and students, and then collecting feedback.  There are not many such platforms in Russia, but in the USA, for example, a lot of attention is paid to graduates. <br><br>  One of our favorite cases: large companies, for example, <a href="http://blog.potok.io/snapchat-branding/">use</a> targeted ads on Snapchat based on geolocation, telling candidates about working at the company - as General Electric, Mailchimp, and even Goldman Sachs do.  And this means that the competition for young professionals is very high, that companies are ready to educate and grow tough professionals. <br><br>  <a href="http://debut.careers/">Debut:</a> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/84e/2f4/7ee/84e2f47ee62d48c3a718be4ab131e60d.png"><br><br>  Another service that is not in infographics, but which seems to us very curious.  This application in which graduates and students can solve tasks from the coolest employers in a playful way and receive prizes.  But this is not just a question and answer, these are real games in which you can pass levels and really play a little.  After successful completion, there is a chance to immediately get an interview without tedious waiting, or even suddenly become an intern at Google.  You can create a profile in the application in 60 seconds.  Depressive interface exactly attracts teens: D <br><br>  <b>// Manage candidate flow:</b> <br><br>  This category contains ATS (Applicant Tracking Systems) - platforms for managing the flow of candidates, allowing you to communicate with them, as well as connect a command, collect and process a response, analyze the hiring process, and so on.  Typically, ATS are accompanied by serious analytical tools and may include some of the functions of all the above tools, or vice versa, something completely unique. <br><br>  <a href="https://www.lever.co/">Lever:</a> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/fc2/13d/6d1/fc213d6d1ac94bb3a71c1375df26ad49.png"><br><br>  The guys offer to reconsider their approach to recruitment.  This platform has everything for hiring (tools for sourcing), as well as the ability to promote the employer's brand using response forms and company description pages that are created in a special constructor. <br><br>  <a href="https://potok.io/">potok:</a> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e96/0ea/513/e960ea51390445729ced1d7f14587876.png"><br><br>  A platform that allows you to optimize all processes related to recruitment.  The system will give you the opportunity to attract the best candidates (convenient response both through a posted job post on social networks, a career site and work sites), organize the process of working with them (correspondence, setting up meetings, integrating with the calendar, etc.), as well as attracting colleagues for making common solutions.  And, of course, the 5 most important analytical reports that will allow you to use the data to solve important problems and save your time and money.  The designer of career sites is attached, as well as synchronization with telephony and many other cool buns! <br><br>  <b>// Automate specific HR processes:</b> <br><br>  Services, which somehow allow to automate one of the HR-processes.  This may be the management of employee profiles, testing, reporting and adaptation of new employees.  And it is here that big changes are taking place now, because bots have become the hottest topic. <br><br>  Let's tell right away about two interesting products. <br><br>  <a href="https://recruitz.io/">Recruitz.io:</a> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f11/243/f1f/f11243f1fb94494e994883b59ee62365.png"><br><br>  Programmatic advertising is already here and its capabilities are surprising.  Translate: this is a cool new tool for creating targeted vacancy ads.  The service offers you to go beyond job boards and shows your vacancy only to those who are really interested in it.  Algorithms collect a huge amount of data (hi, Big Data): demographic factors, and interests, analyze online behavior, and so on.  This is a fully automated process of posting ads in social media (Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and so on).  We have not tried, but it sounds bombing! <br><br>  <a href="https://trymya.io/">Mya:</a> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/1ed/74c/8a6/1ed74c8a6b8a4a49b57c533af0acbeca.png"><br><br>  If someone talks about artificial intelligence in recruitment, then it‚Äôs most likely about Mya.  While it is closest to the possible implementation of the capabilities of AI.  Mya is a bot that will help you start saving time on screening candidates and conducting it through all the stages of selection, and the candidate will be able to ask all the important questions for him at any time and get an answer. <br><br>  If about Mya is still not clear, now explain.  A candidate has responded to your vacancy on a career site.  Mya writes to him, asks questions asked by the system about the requirements and so on, and then, after the end of the conversation, sends a transcript to your ATS.  Or make an appointment (because it can also be synchronized with the calendar). <br><br>  <b>// Screening:</b> <br><br>  <a href="https://www.pymetrics.com/">Pymetrics</a> , <a href="https://www.hirevue.com/">HireVue</a> - all of these platforms offer various tools for testing candidates even before they pass interviews.  Here, the creators' imagination knows no bounds: gamification and testing in a variety of ways in order to be sure that you and the employee will approach each other (only without astrology so far: D). <br><br>  <a href="https://www.pymetrics.com/">Pymetrics:</a> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/14c/b14/a5e/14cb14a5e902493ab69ccfad9f2c7710.png"><br><br>  A service that knows exactly which position will suit the candidate and which company. <br><br>  Pymetrics is a system built on the analysis of many factors of the human brain and the personal qualities of employees.  The guys introduced gamification in the not always pleasant job search process and / or a new candidate. <br><br>  If you are a candidate, you can get access to the service for free and start playing - using simple puzzles and tasks, the service will evaluate your motivation, ability to hold attention and tell you which position suits you best.  The same applies to companies - they are helped to find candidates that fit perfectly into the fabric of corporate culture. <br><br>  Different professions suggest the presence of different skills and it is not always possible to measure how suitable a person is using IQ or EI.  Yes, and SAT, GMAT, LSAT - tests that have already become boring and HR'am and candidates. <br><br>  <b>// Work sites</b> <br><br>  Platforms for posting vacancies and attracting potential candidates for closing open positions.  Gradually, the function of working sites will take on, it seems, social media.  After the appearance of the new <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/11/07/jobbook/">Facebook function for posting a job</a> and collecting the response, there is less and less doubt.  So among the coolest projects here, we would mark Facebook Jobs - take a look, it will soon become a place to look for work.  100%! <br><br>  <b>// Check background</b> <br><br>  Startups creating tools for screening a background for potential employees.  Also insanely important topic.  In Russia, as you understand, the story of the preliminary verification of the candidate is quite different. <br><br>  <b>// Salary Comparison Tools</b> <br><br>  Tools for comparing salaries for different positions, corporate culture of companies and so on.  Simple tools, quite relevant, but for the ‚Äúgray‚Äù market of Russian employers is not relevant at all. <br><br>  <b>// Planning</b> <br><br>  Services for planning, optimization, reporting on the number of staff and wages.  Also, tools to adjust the working time of employees who work remotely. <br><br>  <b>// Salary and allowances</b> <br><br>  These companies are engaged in software that allows you to monitor the payment of wages, as well as manage insurance, bonuses and so on.  Do not excel'em one, as they say. <br><br>  <b>// Flexible recruitment</b> <br>  Most of these startups create platforms for companies with remote employees, employees who work part time and freelancers.  And also help companies develop a culture of free work schedule.  Now it is becoming more relevant questions (heard about Befree? The guys were able to reduce office space = 20% save). <br><br>  Follow the changes in the world of HR-technology with us - we will see here more often.
