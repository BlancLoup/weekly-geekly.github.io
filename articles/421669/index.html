      Human rights defenders managed to defend the freedom of speech and the right to freely publish files on the Internet. <br><br>  The Second Amendment Foundation and the Defense Distributed filed a lawsuit against the US Department of State when the Obama administration in May 2013 imposed a ban on the distribution of weapons print files, citing the old Cold War law of the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR). <br><br>  In July 2018, by agreement of the parties, the ban was lifted.  In addition, the US Department of Justice agreed to pay all legal costs of the plaintiff and to additionally compensate for the $ 10,000 fee that Defense Distributed had to pay to the State Department as a result of the previous restriction. <br><br>  As a result of the agreement, the state recognized that non-automatic firearms up to a caliber of 0.50, including modern semi-automatic sporting rifles, such as the popular AR-15 rifle and similar firearms, "are not military in nature."  Human rights activists consider this not only an important victory for constitutional freedoms and the right to free speech, but also a serious blow to the "left" lobby, which is trying to prohibit citizens from wielding weapons. <br><br>  However, on July 30, twenty US states filed a request with a temporary restraining order against Defense Distributed, a federal court in Seattle, which had already opened the DEFCAD site (only for American IP) and began distributing files to print weapons.  Within hours, the court issued this order, which prohibits Defense Distributed from freely distributing gun files on the Internet. <br><br>  In a joint statement, representatives of 20 US states express the view that the agreement between the State Department and human rights defenders violates the Administrative Procedure Act, as well as the Tenth Amendment to the US Constitution, which allows each state to regulate firearms within its borders. <br><br>  But Cody Wilson found a way out.  He interpreted the ban literally: the document prohibits the <b>free</b> distribution of digital models.  To get around this limitation, he began selling flash drives with the same information.  The price of the goods is set by the buyer (Name Your Price). <br><br>  As Cody stated, ‚Äúseveral hundred‚Äù orders have now been processed: ‚ÄúAnyone who wants these files will receive them.  I'm going to sell them, I'll send them.  It started this morning, ‚ÄùWilson said in a <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2018/08/28/us/3d-printed-guns-cody-wilson-blueprint/index.html">comment to</a> CNN.  - It will never stop.  The free flow of ideas cannot be stopped. ‚Äù  He said that one guy bought files for an AR-15 rifle for $ 15, many pay $ 1, there are orders for $ 10 and $ 8.  ‚ÄúIt's very generous, people are eager to support us,‚Äù says Cody. <br><br>  The activist shared his plans to realize the sale of files also by e-mail and through a download link.  In addition, the company intends to file an appeal to cancel the aforementioned temporary restraining order. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/421669/">https://habr.com/ru/post/421669/</a></p>
