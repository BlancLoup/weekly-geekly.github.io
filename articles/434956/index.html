What to do?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  <b>Let's start with the facts.</b>  The company is engaged in the layout of projects.  PSD to HTML, PSD to Wordpress, etc.  Works on the market for 8 years.  Two offices.  40 people on staff.  About 20 to outsource.  Customers are mainly from the USA.  Layouts, programmers, QA, project managers from Ukraine \ Belarus. <br><br>  <b>What is the task</b> : the owner shows the calculations.  It can be seen that the company is growing.  The number of customers is growing, the number of orders is growing.  But along with this, costs are rising, and net profit does not increase significantly. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b>How does everything work?</b>  For 8 years of work, the backbone of regular customers has been formed.  They bring about 70% of the profits.  The remaining 30% are new customers.  New customers are led by advertising (mostly Google Adwords, occasionally guest posts on thematic sites). <br><br>  <b>What happens when you try to earn more?</b>  The company increases the advertising budget.  The graph shows that in January 2018 and March 2018 there were attempts to double and triple to increase the AdWords advertising budget.

Knows your customer.  There is a special person who optimizes keywords, bids, looks at the statistics of auctions ... <br><br>  In short, the numbers reflect the audience of the advertising channel. <br><br>  Of the 100% Google users interested in layout, in this case 77% is <br><br><ul><li>  small private companies </li><li>  individual entrepreneurs </li><li>  competitors, just curious users </li><li>  bots, click, click fraud, etc. </li></ul><br>  If someone from this audience is ready to place an order, payment for the services of the whole studio will be too expensive.  In practice, negotiations with them end in nothing.  These go and order the layout of freelancers. <br><br>  23% are representatives of the target audience: large corporate companies, design agencies \ studios.  For reliability, reputation, delivery of projects on time, the experience of these companies are willing to overpay. <br><br>  From month to month, the numbers vary slightly, but the proportions generally remain. <br><br>  <b>It turns out in order to increase the number of customers by 23% through Google, you need to expand your advertising budget by 117%</b> .  Moreover.  Of these 23%, not all will place an order.  Approximately half will not accept the working conditions, price, terms, etc.  In reality, the company will increase the number of orders by 12%. <br><br>  Next question.  Who will serve the new 12% of orders? <br><br><ul><li>  project manager loaded with work with existing clients.  We have to take an additional manager, who will work part-time or some of the employees will partially take over the functions of the project manager. </li></ul><br><ul><li>  Who will build / test new projects?  The owner does not want to take additional people to the state for salary.  Says month to month is not necessary.  In a good month we earn, in a bad they will eat what was earned in a good one. </li></ul><br>  We have to partially attract freelancers from the outside in order to have time to close projects on time.  Partially overload full-time employees with new projects, which threatens to shift the deadlines for the delivery of projects to both existing customers and new ones. <br><br>  It turns out the company seems to be developing.  The number of orders is growing.  But if you look at the situation as a whole over the year, advertising costs increased, and the staff and net profit eventually did not grow much (the owner asked not to disclose the business figures). <br><br>  It turns out the company‚Äôs development strategy for the company looks like this: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/t-/m4/oe/t-m4oejmpwni_d2h8rjdc_jqtq4.jpeg"><br><br>  The trend is that the US market is saturated.  Companies that want to earn on it is becoming more and more.  Growing competition.  Expensive click.  The cost of attracting customers is expensive.  The cost of the actual order received from the target company, etc. <br><br>  Parse orders.  They are different.  One company orders a large project for 5000, another needs minor modifications for $ 300. <br><br>  <b>We can refuse small completions?</b>  Work only with large orders, and small ones to give to outsource.  It will not work.  All large projects periodically need updates, edits, updates.  The project manager is assigned to the client, we try to build relationships.  Taking 5000 from a client, and then sending him to freelancers when he wants to change something a little is hopeless.  So you can not build a business. <br><br>  <b>Can we refuse small customers?</b>  From those who order small volumes.  We can.  But how to understand who is big and who is small?  Google ad shows on request.  And there who will click, that will click.  We would be happy to give only large.  But Google serves everyone. <br><br>  The decision suggests itself: to narrow the audience, focus only on the target segment.  Those.  do this way: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ss/qk/kz/ssqkkzvkwa95kr4nszrldu4onhc.jpeg"><br><br>  Or like this: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/xz/9t/ob/xz9tobisvbputbn6js9sdrzzthy.jpeg"><br><br>  <b>Why are we working on several options?</b>  Because it is not known in advance what will work and what does not.  We try to simulate processes, prescribe actions as carefully as possible.  And then the practice will show what works, what needs to be corrected. <br><br>  <i>For example option 1. Personal meeting.</i>  <i>How and by whom to introduce yourself.</i>  <i>What to say.</i>  <i>What should be the result.</i>  <i>What to do in this or that situation.</i> <br><br>  Strategy: to consistently work out companies one after another.  The staff is predictable to expand as contracts are signed with new design studios.  For a specific company hired specific employees. <br><br>  The first results are already there.  It will take a little more time we will systematize everything, translate it into numbers.  If the topic is interesting, let me know to write a sequel. <br><br>  <b>In general, if you are faced with a similar situation: development seems to be underway, and profits are not very good - disassemble the work of the company into separate business processes.</b>  Somewhere you will definitely see a narrow neck.  Someone is looking for customers, employee efficiency, sales.  Try to analyze, get to the bottom of the problem.  If something is not clear, try to translate everything into numbers.  Doubt even what has worked for years.  In this case, the company worked for 8 years attracting customers through Google.  But it's time to adapt. <br><br>  All success in 2019! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/434956/">https://habr.com/ru/post/434956/</a></p>
