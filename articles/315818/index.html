Its author is a core developer of Python, a Ukrainian programmer Andrei Svetlov (read more about it <a href="http://ain.ua/chelovek-kotoryj-pishet-python-kak-ukrainec-andrej-svetlov-stal-core-developerom-populyarnogo-yazyka-programmirovaniya">here</a> ).  Andrew is one of the world's leading experts in Python and the creator of the author's course.  He had never read it in Moscow before, so our event is a great chance for anyone interested in Python and asynchronous development to get new knowledge and answers to their questions directly from the creator of popular tools. <br><br>  We talked with Andrew about what questions will be addressed on the course, to whom it may be useful, and what other resources Python developers should explore to improve their level. <a name="habracut"></a>

    <h3>  Why did not you manage to read the course in Moscow before? </h3><br>  Organizing such an event is not the easiest thing.  It is necessary to choose and book a venue, provide listeners with the opportunity to have a bite to eat (still, classes take several hours and more than one day), deal with payment acceptance and bookkeeping.  In general, for me, one of the difficulties was too much, so I am grateful to the colleagues from Positive Technologies, who took upon themselves all the organizational issues.  Now I can come and read the course. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/9f3/9b2/7fe/9f39b27fec714ba0804582ca727ca204.jpg"><br><br><h3>  What is this course about and who is it for? </h3><br>  The Python language is actively developing, the so-called asynchronous programming is becoming increasingly popular.  Its support in Python is provided by the asyncio library.  In addition to working on the core of Python itself, I am one of the developers of this technology and various ‚Äúcanopies‚Äù on it (like a web server). <br><br>  Our course will be devoted on the one hand to the development of websites using this technology, in addition, we will understand more deeply how acyncio works and how to prepare it correctly.  For example, consider the mistakes that make novices and more experienced professionals.  Now there is not so much information on the topic, so this course is a good opportunity to find answers to your questions. <br><br>  As for the target audience, first of all I would advise visiting narrow specialists who are engaged in programming in Python and are interested in new technologies in this field or want to deepen their knowledge.  Of course, something useful will be found for yourself and, say, heads of development departments, but if you are one of them and you want to understand whether it is necessary to implement asyncio in yourself, two days of technically rich content will still be a bit much. <br><br><h3>  What you need to know to be the most useful course? </h3><br>  Before starting the course, knowing and knowing how to work with asyncio is not necessary, although familiarity with alternative approaches such as Twisted and Tornado will be useful.  You need to be able to program in Python and have an idea about how websites are created regardless of the framework - experience with Django and Flask will do. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/8e1/34e/16d/8e134e16ddf84c5aa13ecc4d67281b78.png"><br><br><h3>  What is the structure of the course? </h3><br>  These will not be the usual lectures.  Of course, for the most part everything will be held in the format of my monologue and demonstration of examples, but the format implies the ability to stop me at any time with a clarifying question.  We do not plan to recruit a lot of people for the course - so I can answer every listener.  And so, nothing unusual - a projector, a flipchart with markers, we will not need anything special. <br><br><h3>  Share some useful materials to prepare for the course and further study? </h3><br>  In general, this is a real problem - there are not too many sources of knowledge on the topic of asynchronous programming and Python.  There are practically no books, for the most part the most interesting things are presented in various articles from blogs (often in English, although there are some good materials on Habr√©).  It is also worth exploring the official project repositories and thematic resources: <br><br><ul><li>  <a href="http://www.snarky.ca/how-the-heck-does-async-await-work-in-python-3-5">How the heck does async / await work in Python 3.5?</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://glyph.twistedmatrix.com/2014/02/unyielding.html">Unyielding</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/post/242541/">Writing a framework on asyncio, aiohttp and thoughts about Python3</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://github.com/python/asyncio">Asyncio github repository</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/">Asyncio developer community</a> </li><li>  <a href="http">Aiohttp github repository</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/">Aiohttp developer community</a> </li><li>  Tags <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/search%3Fq%3Dpython-asyncio">python-asyncio</a> and <a href="http">aiohttp</a> on stack <a href="http">overflow</a> </li></ul><br>  <i>We can also recommend to subscribe to the <a href="http://asvetlov.blogspot.ru/">blog</a> of Andrey himself and his <a href="https://twitter.com/andrew_svetlov">Twitter</a> .</i> <br><br><h3>  How to get to the course </h3><br><ul><li>  <b>Venue of the event</b> : Positive Technologies office, Moscow, Preobrazhenskaya Ploshchad 8 (metro station Preobrazhenskaya Ploshchad), map <a href="https://www.ptsecurity.com/ru-ru/about/contacts/">here</a> . </li><li>  <b>Cost</b> : 12,000 rubles, for students - 10,000 rubles. </li><li>  <b>E-mail for operational communication</b> : <a href="">asyncio2016@ptsecurity.com</a> </li></ul><br>  The course will be held on December 17 and 18.
