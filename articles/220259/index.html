As you remember, we recently <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/tm/blog/210726/">significantly upgraded</a> our freelance exchange <a href="http://freelansim.ru/">Freelansim</a> .  Now we are in a hurry to share one more news - we did not ignore those who are looking for a permanent job (or permanent employee). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/2b1/57f/e1e/2b157fe1ec1d2186a42ebc487acb852f.png"><br><br>  Our social network for IT-specialists ‚ÄúBrainstorage‚Äù has received a great update, on which we have been working for the last months.  So, meet the "Brainstorage 2.0". <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Let's start with a little lyrical digression.  Until today, <a href="http://tmtm.ru/">TM</a> , in addition to <a href="http://www.habrahabr.ru/">Habr</a> and <a href="http://www.toster.ru/">Toaster</a> , had the following IT projects:

The service is designed to help professionals accumulate information about the acquired experience in one place (education, work experience, portfolio, professional skills, recommendations) and present it in a convenient way to friends, colleagues and all those interested in potential cooperation. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d8d/76e/948/d8d76e948c90754d4bb46bef3cc15332.png">  <b>Hantim</b> is a project where the best companies in the industry place their IT-vacancies, mostly ‚Äúoffline‚Äù.  Huntim's opportunities are enjoyed not only by young and growing companies, but also by such giants as <a href="http://brainstorage.me/companies/yandex/jobs">Yandex</a> , <a href="http://brainstorage.me/companies/mailrugroup/jobs">Mail.Ru Group</a> , <a href="http://brainstorage.me/companies/badoo/jobs">Badoo</a> , <a href="http://brainstorage.me/companies/epam/jobs">EPAM Systems</a> , HeadHunter, and others.  For a short time, the project has helped companies to close thousands of vacancies, and for users of our services - to find an interesting job. <br><br> <a href="http://freelansim.ru/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/218/84e/7de/21884e7de5f145db55011b90328f4cc3.png"></a>  <a href="http://freelansim.ru/"><b>Freelansim.ru</b></a> is a freelance exchange for IT specialists.  Recently, the second beta version of the project was launched, on which a subscription system appeared and closer integration with our other projects, including Brainstorage. <br><br><hr><br>  For a long time, our team had ideas about combining <a href="http://brainstorage.me/"><b>Brainstorage.me</b></a> and <b>Huntim</b> .  The fact is that these projects have a lot in common, both are related to job search and are designed for one audience.  Therefore, it was logical to combine projects into one: such a project is easier to maintain, and it can work much more effectively and efficiently - both for employers and for applicants. <br><br>  So, from today on Brainstorage the following innovations: <br><br><h2>  For users </h2><br>  <b>1.</b> The main page displays a list of vacancies - the same as was on the main page of Hunthim. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/579/23b/d51/57923bd51885daa347b41cf8b0e577de.png"><br><br>  <b>2.</b> Now you can respond to your favorite job with your profile on Brainstorage.  Earlier, for responses, email had to be used (which could sometimes get lost somewhere along the way), but now a private form is used to talk with the employer - its principle of operation has already been worked out for Freelansim and, as our statistics say, many like it. <br><br>  Now you don‚Äôt need to tell everything about yourself in the letter - just write a response (according to the instructions in the job), attach your work from the portfolio and wait: the employer will see all the necessary information in your profile.  The more information you have indicated about yourself, the higher your chances of finding a job offer. <br><br>  <b>3.</b> Nothing more.  As before, Brainstorage remained a simple ad-free website, where you don‚Äôt have to pay for a visual portfolio, recommendations, etc. <br><br><h2>  For companies </h2><br>  <b>1.</b> All vacancies go to the main page of Brainstorage, whose attendance is higher than the main page of Hunthim.  If before all the vacancies were not ignored, now you can close the vacancy even faster. <br><br>  <b>2.</b> All responses from experts come in a convenient form, immediately below the text of the vacancy.  Now you do not need to add the applicant to Skype, write to the mail or call him: you can start a conversation directly from the job page, and if necessary, go to personal correspondence with him (which will remain even when the vacancy is closed). <br><br>  <b>3. The</b> responses will not clutter up the mail - they will all be in the same place, and for their processing there appeared tools similar to those on Freelance: sorting to interesting or archival. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e88/d0c/a7a/e88d0ca7aa1219d1e7ba2d80f3c54a9f.png"><br>  <font color="#a5a5a5"><i>Response off topic or you invited the user and he did not fit you?</i></font>  <font color="#a5a5a5"><i>Move it to the archive.</i></font>  <font color="#a5a5a5"><i>Did someone from the experts?</i></font>  <font color="#a5a5a5"><i>One click and it is already in the marked folder.</i></font> <br><br>  <b>4.</b> No need to wait for someone to respond to the vacancy: the site will automatically offer 20 suitable candidates from Brainstorage, based on the skills, city and openness of the specialists to the proposals indicated in the vacancy.  Immediately after the vacancy is posted, you can start searching for the required specialist - if 20 candidates are not enough, you can subscribe to the " <a href="http://brainstorage.me/info/service">Access the Resume Database</a> " service and get more tools to search through the entire user base, as well as the ability to create <a href="http://brainstorage.me/info/help">tracking lists</a> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/4a2/fc4/bf2/4a2fc4bf26ed8064796c1a4a1cd250b6.png"><br>  <font color="#a5a5a5"><i>Tracking lists are a handy tool for monitoring people of interest to you.</i></font>  <font color="#a5a5a5"><i>Create an unlimited number of lists, for example, ‚ÄúDesigners‚Äù, ‚ÄúProgrammers‚Äù, ‚ÄúProject Managers‚Äù, ‚ÄúKey Employees of Competitors‚Äù - and you will be the first to know that someone in the list is ready to change jobs or is considering proposals.</i></font> <br><br>  <b>5.</b> Any user can start several companies and switch between them in a couple of clicks. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/9c2/e42/139/9c2e421392797ae39427610a294942f0.png"><br><br>  In each company, you can assign up to 7 HR employees, each of whom will have access to vacancies, billing, tracking lists and company card administration. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/1ae/a88/8c6/1aea888c6bcff3f29630a3e50b9e4b26.png"><br><br>  When creating a vacancy, you can specify which of the employees will be responsible for this vacancy - these people will receive all notifications. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/61f/95b/ef1/61f95bef1aa38a5026641172f45fb4f3.png"><br><br>  <b>6.</b> The company's card has become even more functional, there are more opportunities for branding. <br><br>  <b>7.</b> New billing from Yandex.Money, which made it even easier to top up the balance.  By the way, the domestic currency, the ‚Äúpatron‚Äù (so liked by the metaphor with the hunt), is now called ‚Äúcandy wrapper‚Äù, as in Freelance. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/663/8ca/4b9/6638ca4b936c4a3fb29dad006a7f16d9.png"><br><br>  <b>8.</b> Authorization via <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/tm/blog/201946/">TM ID</a> : one account allows you to use all <a href="http://tmtm.ru/">TM</a> projects. <br><br>  Please note that all vacancies and company cards previously created at Huntim have not gone away - now they are at a new address and overgrown with new functions. <br><br>  We hope innovations will help professionals find an interesting job, and companies - to effectively solve personnel problems. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/220259/">https://habr.com/ru/post/220259/</a></p>
