      <b>Why software from Microsoft takes the lion‚Äôs share of the market worldwide despite its cost?</b> <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  The most significant benefits of Microsoft business software are standardization and mutual integration.  This, in turn, causes a high interchangeability of its staff, i.e.  IT specialists.  Plus, thanks to the profits from sales, Microsoft is constantly developing an affiliate network that earns not only on product support, but also on sales.  This is an important factor, because  Microsoft software is ACTIVE in the market. <br><br>  Free software has no initial cost (read - product prices) for the user, which is his main advantage.  Especially for Russian business;) But in the process of integrating free software and using it, problems arise that are inherent in Microsoft software (I will list the ones I encountered myself): <br>  - it is more difficult to find a sufficiently qualified specialist (Windows specialists are much more: ‚ÄúI am a specialist, I reinstalled the Windows two times!‚Äù;) <br>  - Each specialist comes to the monastery with its own charter.  Software integration schemes and methods are different for each of them.  As actually preferred software.  Therefore, there are cases when it is necessary to indulge gradually around the person in order to avoid the situation ‚Äúwe start all over again‚Äù; <br>  - it also happens that some developers simply bother to support and develop their distributions.  ‚ÄúWe start all over again‚Äù; <br>  - it is necessary to retrain users who, by an incredible coincidence, are accustomed to Windows and others like it; <br>  - there are real compatibility issues.  Many partners and clients of the business use Microsoft products anyway. <br><br>  <b>We combine OpenSource with Copyright.</b> <br><br>  How can free software increase market share and win the hearts of ordinary users? <br><br>  Here are my thoughts on this: <br>  1. <i>Standardization and integration.</i>  Maybe scattered free software teams should come together?  Or create a body that will develop and approve common standards and schemes for software interaction with each other, interfaces, etc.  Or a separate group of developers who will solve the problems of integrating various software. <br>  2. <i>Yes Wizards are famous!</i>  Have you seen wizards in Windows Server 2008?  In my opinion even a first-year student with their help will lift a bunch of services on a sideboard.  In short, you give a total simplification in * nix, and step-by-step helpers for everything and everything !!!  No need to scare off from school by complexity and incomprehensibility.  And for the gurus and just curious - Shell will not go anywhere. <br>  3. <i>Compatibility!</i>  This is a task for specialists - tear it up the ass, but make full compatibility with the Word and Excel!  In my practice, this is the main argument against deploying workstations on * nixes. <br>  4. <i>Does the business need a complete freebie?</i>  I understand that free software is developed by enthusiasts.  Maybe it's worth their enthusiasm to send in the right direction, and even warm up with money?  Suppose that software with functionality similar in characteristics to Microsoft's software, and compatible with it in formats, will cost three times less than the latter - it will be a bomb in the software market.  And do not think that this will kill the very idea of ‚Äã‚Äãfree software.  A business does not buy a code, but a ready-made solution that is capable of solving its tasks as effectively as possible at minimum cost.  A businessman (manager) doesn‚Äôt care if it‚Äôs open or not.  He is concerned with the totality of expenses for the purchase, introduction and maintenance of a product, and the totality of the benefits and incomes that this product will bring.  Sell ‚Äã‚Äãnot software, but ready-made solutions for business!  Well, unique solutions are not a sin and protect against copy-paste. <br><br>  <b>Total:</b> <br><br>  Gentlemen of the open source, feel free to tyrit good ideas from copyright tycoons!  The same Microsoft many times took good ideas, reworked and focused them on the convenience for the end user and <s>made money on it</s> raised its popularity.  I do not call to copy a tape of tools from the last office.  I‚Äôm talking about common models for building and interacting software products: simple interface, mutual integration, easy setup and management, compatibility, ready (assembled) solutions for specific tasks.  And most importantly - standardization. <br>  And if the ‚ÄúFree Software - Money‚Äù connection is repugnant to someone, then invest in training specialists.  For they really miss them. <br><br>  <b>PS</b> Actually the answer to the topic header (in terms of business, as a software consumer): <br>  Open source software pleases with its ‚Äúlow cost‚Äù, which helps not to strangle a small business at the very beginning. <br>  And software from Microsoft (Apple, Orakl ... - who is closer) - clear, convenient, easier to maintain. <br><br>  Something like this.  In my opinion it turned out somewhat messy.  I promise to grow in oratory. <br>  Now judge strictly. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/89749/">https://habr.com/ru/post/89749/</a></p>
