You can not pick up, leave.  Many colleagues faced the question of returning usernames identical to a registered trademark.  We take the bull by the horns - it is not always necessary to do this, we advise not all our customers to return user names.  Moreover, there is a clear bad example of how to do it ‚Äî Nokia‚Äôs actions on the VKontakte group.  The company has made a lot of bad karma in its address. <br><br>  We have a completely different case.  The users whose names we were interested in were either inactive or unpopular, or kept accounts in violation of the rules.  It was decided to return.  So let's go ... <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>  <b>It is given</b> .  A trademark registered in three countries: United Kingdom, Germany and Ukraine, using the WIPO-ROMARIN system. 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>
        <script>
          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      <b>Required</b> .  Return user names in four social networks: VKontakte, Facebook, Twitter and Youtube. <br><br>  <b>Very fast Twitter</b> .  The easiest and fastest way was to return the name to Twitter.  Twitter has a fairly simple, intuitive form for such requests: <a href="http://support.twitter.com/forms/">http://support.twitter.com/forms/</a> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/48/b3/48b3f03b4b6f19a1db4f5dc57b3e36ce.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/19/6b/196b1a11c7094105c71ce7d0d9de4483.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Since we were authorized by the owner of the brand, we chose the second item.  But in fact, there is no difference between the first two points in the form.  But the third point, when you want to "convey" to someone, is not accepted.  Twitter does not even want to consider such requests from ‚Äúwell-wishers‚Äù. <br><br>  The form is simple and straightforward.  The most important thing is to know the trademark registration number and the system by which it was registered.  After that you filled out the form to the specified email address immediately receives a letter of notification that the application has been accepted into the work. <br><br>  A day later, a letter arrived that our request was satisfied and we were offered a choice - you can transfer the user name to an existing account or create a new one. <br><br>  The transfer does not occur immediately.  At first, we were even a little scared - at the old address, microblogging was no longer available, and the new one was not yet available.  Account ‚Äúoverflow‚Äù lasted for about 6 hours.  Apparently it all depends on the servers on which there were microblogging, as well as on the volume of one or another microblog. <br>  Deadline for two days. <br><br>  <b>Not complete Facebook.</b>  Facebook does not have a special form for user names and trademarks.  We used the standard form of copyright infringement.  <a href="http://www.facebook.com/legal/copyright.php%3Fcopyright_notice%3D1">http://www.facebook.com/legal/copyright.php?copyright_notice=1</a> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/ac/e4/ace4cec32e688dba5b585cfd4649750c.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Everything is not so simple and clear as on Twitter, but the form can be filled out in Russian. <br><br>  Answers from the support service also come in Russian.  The username was returned, but the old name of the page was changed to a new one in the administration in a very veiled form.  The administration simply did not answer the question about this, sending as a response the last of its letter with a part of the ‚Äúhelp‚Äù for registering pages. <br><br>  Deadline - two days. <br><br>  <b>Strange Vkontakte</b> .  The strangest collaboration was with VKontakte.  The name was not taken ... but not available for registration.  And when both we and the client tried to register it, an error simply occurred that the browser could not register this page. <br><br>  There is nothing about trademarks and their protection in the VKontakte documentation. <br><br>  At a conference, the spokesperson for the social network Vlad Tsyplukhin announced the address of partners [gav] corp.vk.com, where you can write about copyright protection of trademarks.  This address is not indicated on the tech support page on the VKontakte site, but at least help comes from it. <br>  The name of the group was added after 2 weeks of correspondence. <br><br>  <b>Very weird and very fast YouTube</b> .  At first, we thought that nothing would come out of YouTube, since the position that was clearly voiced in the certificate did not imply any discrepancies - <a href="http://www.google.com/support/youtube/bin/answer.py%3Fhlrm%3Den-GB%26answer%3D151655">http://www.google.com/support/youtube/bin/answer.py?hlr==en-GB&amp;answer= 151655</a> "The use of another's trademark in the user name itself may not be illegal." <br><br>  If the user‚Äôs name does not violate the law, YouTube asks users to solve this problem themselves by contacting via a personal message form: ‚ÄúYouTube cannot act as an intermediary in resolving trademark disputes between users and trademark owners.  Therefore, we strongly recommend trademark owners to resolve disputes directly with the owner of the user name.  Trademark owners can connect with users through YouTube‚Äôs private messaging feature. ‚Äù <br><br>  The user whose account we were interested in did not respond to the letter, judging by the profile he was in China and was not on his profile page for more than 1 year.  In such cases, YouTube offers to resolve the issue by contacting the site administration directly.  To do this, you must fill out the form of a message on legal issues  The link to the form is available in the help, however it leads ... not to the form, but to the YouTube Contact Service <a href="http://www.google.com/support/youtube/bin/request.py%3Fcontact_type%3Dlegal2">http://www.google.com/support/youtube/bin/request.py?contact_type=legal2</a> and to the question and answer forums. <br><br>  Before getting on the forum itself, YouTube suggests choosing a language convenient for us.  Choose "Russian" and get on the ... English-speaking forum.  Next - more interesting.  Choose ‚Äúcreate a question‚Äù to finally ask someone about our situation.  And we are confronted with the fact that for us there is no corresponding category: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/87/10/8710bf92fea72e54b6fb39bc3d3f17c6.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  As a result, select the category "Accounts" and ask the question in it.  A day later, a response comes from one of the YouTube volunteers with a link to the help page from where we started. <br><br>  Once in the loop, but not completely entangled in it, we decide to continue our journey.  We return to the original trademark reference page, but we are already choosing any English language. <br><br>  The text already speaks not only about the form of notification of legal problems, but specifically about the Trademark complaint form.  Going through the appropriate link, we really see the request for trademarks: <a href="http://www.google.com/support/youtube/bin/request.py%3Fcontact_type%3Dlegal2%26hl%3Den">http://www.google.com/support/youtube/bin/request.py?contact_type=legal2&amp;hl=en</a> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/fe/be/febeb62d1b442fc04b77cb3913613a9d.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Select the first option - ‚Äútrademark is used in the user name‚Äù.  And we get into a form similar to other American social networks: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/ec/0e/ec0e10517c1c96acb95acb4f420d0095.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The answer to the request came in 20 (!) Minutes.  The YouTube administration reported that due to the inactivity of the specified user, our request was satisfied.  They promised to contact us with the service email box within an hour and provide access to the account. <br><br>  A letter from the service mailbox arrived 15 (!) Minutes after the first letter.  The letter indicated that to access the site under the desired account, we need to use the email address and temporary password provided earlier in the form.  What is interesting - YouTube did not just reset the channel, it deleted the information of the old user, deleted the email box attached to the account, but did not delete the user statistics.  That is, we received a channel without video but with views and registered in 2009. <br><br>  <b>Conclusions</b> .  Returning usernames to registered trademarks is not at all as scary as it may seem at first glance.  Once again we pay attention that this procedure is not always necessary and, moreover, is not always useful.  One such operation can bring a lot of problems with the audience involved if you do it thoughtlessly. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/119856/">https://habr.com/ru/post/119856/</a></p>
