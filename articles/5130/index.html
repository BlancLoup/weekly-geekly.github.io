This name appeared in those times when the overwhelming majority considered only church marriages to be legal.  And a civil marriage was something, let's say, of a lower order.  Since then, crowned marriages have become significantly smaller, and civilian in everyday life is called marriage, in which the relations of the spouses are not formed at all.  Simply put, cohabitation.  But cohabitants, and even just friends, and same-sex couples want to live somewhere.  And if several years ago the mortgage loan option was not available to them, now it has become part of our reality.  Although not the most common. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>

      <b>Through hardship to the stars</b> <br><br>  For a long time, most banks limited the number of borrowers to the official family.  Arguments in defense of this position were the most simple.  ‚ÄúEither there is a marriage with all the ensuing legal consequences, or there is none.  Our bank does not provide mortgage loans to civilian spouses, taking the view that buying an apartment on credit is no less important a question than marriage, and in financial terms, perhaps even more responsible.  Civilian spouses need to sort out their personal relationships, and then take out a loan, which will have to be returned for a very long time, ‚Äùsays Anna Pankratova, director of the marketing department of Nomos-Bank's retail business. <br><br>  However, the market is different from any other structure in that it is extremely sensitive and responsive to any customer needs.  And although buying an apartment on equal footing with someone who is not related to you, is not the most common thing, but, nevertheless, there were volunteers for this service.  So, the market is not slow to make offers. <br><br>  One of the first such proposal was followed by Absolut Bank.  ‚ÄúAs a rule, most banks provide an opportunity to become co-borrowers only to members of one family: spouses, relatives.  One of the advantages of the Absolut Bank mortgage loan is that co-borrowers, according to the terms of our program, can be any persons, for example, civilian spouses, friends.  At the same time, when making a decision on issuing a loan, the bank will take into account the total incomes of the co-borrowers, ‚Äùcommented Sergey Dankov, head of the Absolut Bank mortgage lending center. <br><br>  Later in the same format, banks involved in the AHML program began to work.  Then they were joined by several more banks.  Since 2006, the DeltaCredit Mortgage Bank has been issuing loans to borrowers who may not only be married, but also be just friends, neighbors, work colleagues.  Today, the bank considers the total income of up to 4 co-borrowers (i.e., 1 borrower and 3 co-borrowers).  The bank explains this decision by saying that the rise in real estate prices in Moscow and throughout Russia has led to a situation where many people cannot afford to buy an apartment on a mortgage only for their salary and the salary of a spouse.  Thoughts appear to ‚Äúattract‚Äù to consider applications for loans and money from parents or children, and sometimes friends and colleagues, distant relatives.  ‚ÄúIn addition, it is important to take into account the reality in which the bank does business;  It is known that the majority of young people (at least in million-plus cities) do not seek to get a stamp in their passports as soon as possible, although they may live together in a civil marriage for several years, there is no reason not to consider their income as cumulative, ‚Äùexplains DeltaCredit Bank Marketing. <br><br>  Kirill Suslov, the Director General of the mortgage broker LightCredit, is no less optimistic about the situation.  ‚ÄúFor a year and a half, I see absolutely nothing special about mortgage loans for non-relatives.  There are not so many banks issuing loans to ‚Äúfriends‚Äù, civilian couples or groups of comrades in general, but there is no problem finding a particular one.  For example, these are banks operating under the AHML program, or Absolut Bank.  And we, of course, have such an opportunity, and our clients have been acquiring apartments for a very long time, being in a civil marriage, ‚Äùsays Suslov. <br><br>  <b>Lending terms</b> <br><br>  In order to talk about the conditions of lending, you must first determine the terminology.  So, the co-borrower is a person who becomes a co-owner of the acquired property and, together with the main borrower, is responsible to the lender for the repayment and servicing of the loan.  As for the co-borrower's income accounting when calculating a loan, strictly speaking, it is not necessary to take them into account (and confirm) if the borrower's own income is sufficient.  If the purchase is made in half, then the income of the co-borrower is confirmed in the same way as the income of the main borrower.  In principle, a co-borrower can be any adult working person who has official incomes sufficient for lending.  Co-borrower's income is taken into account when calculating the loan amount.  For example, when making an educational loan, co-borrowers are the legal representatives of students, applicants or students - parents, guardians, adoptive parents. <br><br>  When making a housing loan co-borrower, as a rule, becomes a co-owner of the acquired property.  The apartment is issued in the share ownership, and each of the borrowers receive their share.  In this case, the acquired property can be framed in the property of only one of the borrowers.  However, such an approach may subsequently cause problems for borrowers that lie on the same plane as any difficulties associated with an unregistered marriage.  ‚ÄúIf both were paid, and the apartment was registered as the property of only one, then after the loan was paid, in case of a couple‚Äôs separation, it would be difficult to divide the apartment, if not impossible.  And under the same situation, but with a registered marriage - regardless of who the apartment would have been decorated in, in the absence of a marriage contract, the property would be divided, ‚Äùexplains Kiril Suslov. <br><br>  In the case of buying an apartment in shared ownership, the ‚Äúdivorce model‚Äù looks different.  If people break up, they still remain the owners of their shares and are jointly and severally liable for their obligations.  Having paid the loan, they can simply sell their shares to each other or to a third party. <br><br>  Those who attract a co-borrower not to buy an apartment together, but just to present the bank with a source of necessary finances, it is important to know one more thing: when buying an apartment with a co-borrower, the bank has the right to apply to the co-borrowers regardless of the one on whom the property is registered  That is, if you delay the payment, your co-borrower will be jerking.  And from this, even the most friendly relations can be upset.  Therefore, choosing a candidate for such an adventure, weigh the situation more than once. <br><br>  In principle, with regard to the conditions and requirements of banks, then, according to Kirill Suslov, co-borrowers who are not related to each other, are no more difficult to get a loan than relatives or a single borrower.  However, in some banks there may be problems if a loan is taken not by two, but by three or four, but this can also be solved. <br><br>  In all banks, both borrowers are joint borrowers, i.e. they have equal repayment obligations.  From a bank to a bank, only the approach to property registration may differ: some require that all co-borrowers be co-owners, while others are completely satisfied with the ‚Äútwo pay - one owner‚Äù scheme.  This view is shared, for example, by Sergey Dankov.  According to him, the lack of kinship between the co-borrowers does not affect the decision to issue a loan, or the rate, or other conditions.  ‚ÄúAll our co-borrowers are credited on the standard terms of the bank‚Äôs program.  At the same time, all persons whose income was considered participate in the loan agreement as joint borrowers, that is, they are jointly and severally liable for obligations, ‚Äùexplains Dankov. <br><br>  The author: Galina Evdokimova <br>  Source: <a href="http://sob.ru/issue1208.html">Journal Owner</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/5130/">https://habr.com/ru/post/5130/</a></p>
