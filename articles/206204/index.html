Many thanks to its authors! <br>  Now let's go directly to the process. <br><br><h4>  2. Tuts-tuts-tuts or hydrogen drummer </h4><br>  The drummer was not originally from the band - it was immediately decided to perform the soundtracks made on the <i><a href="http://www.hydrogen-music.org/">Hydrogen</a></i> drum machine ( <a href="http://t-hydrogen.ru/">Russian-language website</a> ).  The best of the default libraries (in my opinion) <i>UltraAcoustick</i> .  However, we used the <i>BigMono</i> library from <i>Analogue Drums</i> . <br><br><h5>  2.1.  Description of the <i>BigMono</i> library from <i>Analogue Drums</i> </h5><br>  <b>Pros:</b> <br><ul><li>  significantly exceeds the default libraries in sound; </li><li>  is free. </li></ul><br>  <b>Minuses:</b> <br><ul><li>  weighs 15-20 times more (185 mb); </li><li>  not free; </li><li>  not configured (have to adjust the volume and pan). </li></ul><br>  Under the license, you can download it only from <a href="http://www.analoguedrums.com/details-bm.php">this page</a> (there is no version for <i>Hydrogen</i> ), it is prohibited to upload it to other resources.  Therefore, I do not have the right to post here a link to our assembly.  And I will not advise you to search the library on the website <i>hydrogen-music.org</i> in the <i>Downloads</i> section.  Modifying is also prohibited, so I didn‚Äôt tell you about the <i>ride side</i> and the crashes from the <i>UltraAcoustick</i> .  And do not try to ask me through the mail <i>rtnsl@yandex.ru</i> ready library instructions (&gt;: |).  But I can share our settings. <br><br><h5>  2.2.  Our library settings </h5><br>  You can <a href="https://github.com/gruppa-gruppa-nsk/sources/tree/master/our-BigMono-settings">download the drumkits.xml file</a> and <a href="https://github.com/gruppa-gruppa-nsk/sources/tree/master/our-BigMono-settings">drop</a> it into the ... / drumkits / Big Mono folder (with <a href="http://www.analoguedrums.com/details-bm.php">Wave</a> ) or customize it in the images: <br><br> <a href="http://fotki.yandex.ru/users/utkorose/view/903290/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/72e/996/af9/72e996af9eeda866df0cec41fe54f17b.png" width="500" height="225"></a> <br> <a href="http://fotki.yandex.ru/users/utkorose/view/903289/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/40c/735/67b/40c73567b2768931edc66769af5c179c.png" width="500" height="254"></a> <br><br>  The order of the <i>HiHat</i> tools (not visible in the image): <br><ol><li>  <i>HiHat Closed (LH)</i> </li><li>  <i>HiHat Closed (RH)</i> </li><li>  <i>Hihat open</i> </li><li>  <i>HiHat Semi-Open</i> </li><li>  <i>Hihat pedalled</i> </li></ol><br>  Closed hatches did not seem to us to be closed enough, so their volume is adjusted given that we lower the force of each strike on them by one division (on average). <br>  The overall loudness in the mixer was always set to maximum (even so it was rather quiet). <br><br>  Take the missing samples in the UltraAcoustick library. <br><br><h4>  3. Bassist is to blame </h4><br>  We don't have a bass player either, so we used <a href="http://www.hammersound.com/cgi-bin/soundlink.pl%3Faction%3Dview_download_page%3BID%3D701%3BSoundFont_Location_Selected%3DDownload%2520USA%3BSoundFont_Filename_Selected%3Dnaturally_decaying_b_guitars.rar"><i>Naturally Decaying Bass Guitars</i></a> in <i>SF2</i> format. <br>  <i>SF2 Player</i> is included in <i><a href="http://lmms.sourceforge.net/">LMMS</a></i> as a tool.  In the properties of <i>SF2 Player</i> you need to specify the bass guitar file and select <i>Naturally Finger Bass</i> in the <i>Patch</i> property.  Support for the <i>JACK</i> server is still poorly implemented in <i>LMMS</i> , so the bass line was added to <i>Ardour as</i> standard via export / import wave.  Effects were processed only in <i>Ardour</i> . <br><br><h4>  4. Now for the record. </h4><br>  Mixed by the guitarist group.  He does not plan to start an account on Habr√©, because he just wrote me the main points of his work on the single. <br>  It was originally planned to use <i>Ubuntu Stidio 12.04 (LTS)</i> , which was installed and worked out of the box with only minor problems.  But then the vocal needed an ex-sayter (it allows you to add harmonics to the vocal, making the sound better), but this plug-in is only present in the current version of <i>Calf</i> .  Which because of dependences was not put on 12.04.  With a heavy heart decided to put 13.10.  Experience is not deceived.  We returned to the warm lamp drops of <i>Ardour</i> , <i>JACK</i> and other software, but we got <i>Ardour 3</i> and the desired exceiter. <br><br><h5>  4.1.  <i>JACK</i> server setup </h5><br>  <i>The JACK Audio Connection Kit (JACK)</i> is a daemon-based audio server that allows low-latency interconnection of audio programs that support this technology.  It is required for the work of <i>Ardour</i> . <br>  <i>Ubuntu Studio</i> comes with a graphical <i>qjackctl</i> utility.  Well the whole setup process is <a href="http://michael-bridge.blogspot.ru/2011/03/ardour-linux.html">described here</a> . <br>  After starting <i>qjackctl</i> , select the parameters and put a tick (if it isn‚Äôt) in front of the ‚Äú <i>Realtime</i> ‚Äù item ( <i>Realtime</i> ).  Once a powerful computer has been used, the sampling frequency is 96000, periods per buffer 3. The ‚Äúinterface‚Äù parameter is responsible for selecting the audio unit.  Sound ( <i>Audio</i> ) - duplex. <br>  There were problems with the <i>Frames / Period</i> selections.  With a value above 1024, <i>Ardor</i> refused to export, so 1024 and left.  You can use a lower value. <br><br><h5>  4.2.  <i>Ardour 3.5.74</i> </h5><br>  Unlike <i>Ubuntu 12.04</i> , <i>Ardour 3 is</i> present in the <i>Ubuntu 13.10</i> repositories.  Our guitar player decided to synchronize the faders and other midi-keyboard twists with the <i>Ardor</i> track settings.  I found that the <i>Mackie</i> interface does not work correctly (only <i>Master Volume</i> moves) and reassembled <i>Ardour</i> from source.  To work correctly, <i>Mackie</i> had to be corrected in the source ( <i>/libs/surfaces/mackie/surface.cc</i> ), in the constructor of the class <i>‚ÄúSurface :: Surface (MackieControlProtocol &amp; mcp, const std :: string &amp; device_name, uint32_t number, surface_type_t stype)‚Äù</i> .  <i>", _active (false)"</i> should be replaced by <i>", _active (true)"</i> . <br>  After the first launch of <i>Ardour,</i> you need to specify the project name and folder (home by default).  He connected to the <i>JACK</i> server himself.  If you want to enable synchronization with a jack, find the <i>Internal</i> button between the transport control buttons and the timecode.  After clicking, its value will change to <i>JACK</i> : <i>Ardour</i> and <i>JACK</i> sync is on. <br>  We were pleased with the wide possibilities (considering the gratuity).  Also in the plus effects before the fader (very often in the programs they are after). <br><br><h5>  4.3.  Effects </h5><br>  <i>Calf</i> plug-ins have already been called in Habr√© the best of <i>LADSPA</i> .  We will add to them the <i>TAP Reverberator</i> ( <i>TAP Reverberator</i> ).  However, this was not without problems and the search for a solution.  Most of the effects of <i>TAP</i> and some others had to be eliminated.  For example, <i>Calf Equalizer * Band</i> added wheezing to the bass, especially to the bottom.  And <i>Pitch Shifter</i> is just awful.  If there is a big impulse at the beginning / end of the track, a crash on the tracks or other similar problems, then the shutdown of some effect will most likely help.  Fortunately, the main types of effects are provided in several versions. <br>  For guitar, there is a separate set of <i>Guitarix</i> plugins.  The overload from this set is the best among <i>LADSPA</i> in our opinion.  However, in this case, it was not needed, as the overdrive of the combos and pedals were used. <br><br><h5>  4.4.  Drumming </h5><br>  Pleased with the presence of tires - objects in which you can connect multiple tracks to use the same effects.  While mixing, the drums were processed in Ardour with effects as follows: <br><ul><li>  the batch of each instrument was exported to <i>wave</i> ; </li><li>  all of these tracks were added to <i>Ardour</i> ; </li><li>  for each compressor was hung; </li><li>  4 tires were created: big drum, snare drum, toms, and cymbals; </li><li>  an equalizer was attached to each tire; </li><li>  tires were added ‚Äúbig drum + snare drum‚Äù, ‚Äúeverything‚Äù, and <i>Master</i> ; </li><li>  these tires were processed according to the recommendations of the album. rf / mixing / drums-and-bass. </li></ul><br>  <i>Hydrogen</i> supports exporting the composition to several audio files (separate for each instrument).  It can also be connected directly to <i>Ardour</i> via <i>JACK</i> .  But to save computer resources, it is better to use standard wave export / import. <br><br><h4>  5. Preparation of a single for publication. </h4><br>  For export to <i>flac</i> and <i>mp3</i> formats, <i>soundconverter was</i> used.  <i>EasyTag</i> and <i>Kid3-Qt were</i> used to add tags.  The cover was drawn in <i>Gimp</i> familiar designer.  The font for the cover borrowed from <i>webfont.ru</i> .  Presentation versions of the songs (first verse + chorus) were created using <i>Audacity</i> . <br><br><h4>  6. Results </h4><br>  People with <i>thin and sensitive ear</i> (sic!) Independently made an unequivocal verdict: one feels that it was recorded casually (on a cheap microphone and a maximum of the third take), but the mix is ‚Äã‚Äãgood and the final recording is a demo of tolerable quality.  The task is completed, and in the future we will continue to use the same software.  We hope that <i>Ubuntu Studio 14.04 (LTS)</i> will work as stable as 12.04.  This is exactly what the current version of the distribution kit is missing. <br>  After a while, I would like a professional sound producer to publish his experience on <i>Ubuntu Studio</i> with studio equipment. <br><br>  <b><i>UPD:</i></b> <br>  Did not include useful links to very useful, even if old reviews of music software from under <i>Linux</i> - 7 articles: <br>  <a href="http://wiki.linuxformat.ru/index.php/LXF87-88:%25D0%259C%25D1%2583%25D0%25B7%25D1%258B%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BB%25D1%258C%25D0%25BD%25D1%258B%25D0%25B9_Linux">Overview of all software (2008)</a> <br>  <a href="http://wiki.linuxformat.ru/index.php/LXF102:Ardour">Pro <i>Ardour</i> and <i>JACK</i> (2009)</a> <br><br>  For those who want a newer <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/149477/">overview on Habr√© (2012)</a> <br><br>  Once again I will mention the <a href="http://t-hydrogen.ru/">Hydrogen tutorial book</a> - I would put it between 3 and 4 average on a five-point scale, but someone can help to gain a base. <br><br>  Also <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/klukonin/" class="user_link">Klukonin</a> user <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/206204/">shared his experience</a> : <br><br><blockquote>  1) If you use ubuntu, you can pay attention to the KXstudio repositories. <br>  There you will find the latest Ardour3 builds For ubuntu 12.04 LTS and there are such useful things as the freshest versions, for example, the Calf plugin suite directly from the repository.  They are tagged with -git.  There you will find a patched kernel for low latency (Jack can work with delays of less than 1 ms). <br>  <a href="http://kxstudio.sourceforge.net/">http://kxstudio.sourceforge.net/</a> <br><br>  I strongly recommend not using the Ubuntu Studio build. <br>  I settled on Kubuntu 12.04 LTS.  At the moment, this is the best thing for multimedia. <br><br>  2) There is a very cool host for plug-ins - Carla.  It has a built-in convenient panel for connecting by virtual postings. <br>  And you can control it over the network via the OSC protocol.  There is a ready-made client, but under the x86 architecture. <br><br>  3) On the KXStudio website you can find instructions on tuning the system to achieve stability when recording <br>  <a href="http://wiki.linuxaudio.org/wiki/kxstudio_manual">http://wiki.linuxaudio.org/wiki/kxstudio_manual</a> <br><br>  4) Fine tuning <br>  <a href="http://wiki.linuxaudio.org/wiki/system_configuration">wiki.linuxaudio.org/wiki/system_configuration#solve_irq_conflict_by_unbinding_devices</a> <br><br>  Well, the processor frequency is better to set the maximum and prohibit the shift. <br>  Because precious time is wasted on perestroika, and this causes jitter. </blockquote><br>  I completely forgot! <br><br>  The repository <a href="https://github.com/organizations/gruppa-gruppa-nsk">is ours</a> .
