      - I have my own version.  - quietly said John.  - It seems it was in a scram. <br><br>  - Yes, it was in the scram.  - Bob nodded, still looking out the window.  - And I, honestly, can‚Äôt hear about him anymore.  I do not want to say lofty words, but you have deceived me. <br><br>  - I?  Asked John, puzzled. <br><br>  - You and scrum.  Your scrum  Your initiative.  - Bob turned and stared at John.  Which will cost me a project.  And heaps of money. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  John looked down at the floor.  He understood what the director was driving at. <br><br>  ‚ÄúI ... I understand what you're talking about.‚Äù  - uncertainly mumbled John. <br><br>  ‚ÄúHere ... You're doing great, Johnny, you understand.‚Äù  - on Bob's face there was a displeased grimace.  - What should I do?  I would love to kick you out right now!  Do you understand this? <br><br>  - Yes.  - Without looking up, John said softly. <br><br>  - But my hands are tied!  This project is simply no one to pass!  All teams are loaded to capacity, and before the deadline - just a month.  Month, John!  - Bob began to blush, which is not surprising when his body build - weight under three hundred pounds, shortness of breath, heart problems. <br><br>  - We will try to make an effort.  - John never raised his head. <br><br>  - How?  Well, explain to me?  What else will you think of?  Scrum you already invented, now what?  Kanban?  Devops?  Feather ostrich put in the ass?  - Bob burned more and more. <br><br>  - We will work seven days a week, six days a day.  - continued to mumble John. <br><br>  - What for?  To the team burned?  To someone started to faint fall? <br><br>  - It is necessary - it means it is necessary, we are ready to lay out all the forces on this project ... <br><br>  ‚ÄúIt's you ready, John!‚Äù  - Bob pointed to John, and he had to raise his head so as not to be impolite. <br><br>  - The guys are ready too.  - John, as he could, gave confidence to the voice.  - I talked to them, everyone understands how important this is, and that our destiny ... <br><br>  - Your fate, John!  - shouted Bob.  - Only you are to blame for the failure of the project!  The team is nothing to do with, they are just developers, they do what you say!  How do you drive a herd, so it goes, you know, John? <br><br>  ‚ÄúI understand ...‚Äù John said contritely and bowed his head again. <br><br>  - You were a great developer, and I never thought about making you a team leader.  - continued Bob on raised voices.  - This is an alphabet, an axiom: a good developer is not a good team leader.  But you ... No, I did not deceive me - I just powdered my brain with my scrum, and I decided - here, here it is, the team leader of a new generation!  Initiative, thoughtful, searching, not closed in stereotypes!  The one I need!  How wrong I was! <br><br>  John was silent, not knowing what to say.  The sense of hopelessness was so comprehensive, Bob was so right in everything that John had no idea how to defend himself, or at least turn the conversation to some other channel. <br><br>  - I'm tired, John.  - Bob's anger suddenly subsided.  - I do not know what to do.  You baffled me. <br>  John just nodded his head like a guilty child who is scolded at the school board for the window broken in the classroom. <br><br>  - I, probably, in some sense even understand you.  - Bob stared out the window again.  - I, too, believed in this crap.  I'm talking about scrum.  I also thought that he would help us to do projects faster.  Devil take it, it‚Äôs written on the cover of this damn book!  Four times faster! <br><br>  ‚ÄúThey have different interpretations ...‚Äù John finally mumbled.  ‚ÄúWe worked by manifesto, and ...‚Äù <br><br>  - Yes, I know.  - Bob waved his hand.  - But you are a developer, a pure developer, although you work as a team leader.  Are you interested in the scram? <br><br>  - Well, the process there seems to be correct, I tried this framework on our team, and ... <br><br>  - Exactly.  - Bob nodded and turned back to John and even smiled.  - I say - developed.  For you, the main thing is the process that is inside.  Technology, api, abstract.  Well, how are these your holivars eternal, Reak or Angular, Java or Phn, at the front or on the back.  And what is important to me, you know? <br><br>  - Not.  - John shook his head. <br><br>  - And what is important to the customer, you know?  - with a weary smile continued Bob. <br><br>  - Well, probably the project to be delivered on time. <br><br>  - Exactly.  - Bob raised his finger up.  - And to him, by and large, except in rare cases, it makes no difference what kind of funds you used.  Moreover, it is about the frameworks on which the service operates, and about the technologies that managed the project.  There are wonderful projects that we did in the reactor.  There are wonderful, highly profitable services that we wrote down on the angular.  And there are - failures, devouring a lot of money crafts, for which no one paid - and on the reactor, and on the angular.  Do you understand? <br><br>  - Yes.  - John nodded readily.  - I understand that the matter is not in technology and not in technology. <br><br>  - Well, not quite.  - Bob grimaced.  - Technology, after all, is important.  At least, technology management development, and the project as a whole.  Here, now we know that from the scram, as from the technology of project management, little sense.  I agree? <br><br>  ‚ÄúWell ...‚Äù John pulled.  - Still, I would not ... <br><br>  - Yeah, that's it.  - Bob frowned.  - You do not understand something, or what, Johnny?  I explain poorly? <br><br>  ‚ÄúYes, I understand, just ...‚Äù began John. <br><br>  - Listen, hear and remember: I'll fire you to hell!  - moved Bob to scream.  - I can not lose so much money!  Don just throw me out myself, do you understand that?  We are not on the best score anyway, all we needed was just one more country project! <br><br>  John sighed heavily and stared at Bob.  His gaze was not pleading - what could there be to beg.  Just a minute ago, some kind of hope was warming up - that the conversation would turn into the mainstream of technologies and methods of work, and when, like this, right in the forehead, like cold water from a bucket, what can you say about it.  We must accept fate as it is. <br><br>  - If you think that we have an experimental laboratory here, or a university where you can study, try, make mistakes and try again - then you have mixed up something!  - continued Bob.  - I admit these your researches, tests of new technologies, but only in one case - if it will be useful for business!  Any experiment has a beginning, middle, and end, you know?  Your experiment - the end!  My experiment - the end!  You are my failed experiment.  And scrum - my bad experiment! <br><br>  - Perhaps we made a mistake somewhere using the methods of scram.  - John, realizing that there was nothing to lose, began to speak more boldly.  - It can not be that he did not give any visible result.  You liked the fact that we have become more and more stable to make releases.  And the customer was sort of pleased. <br><br>  - Of course I am satisfied!  Because before that, he did not get anything at all!  - with a vicious grimace on his face continued Bob.  - And now you feed him with these releases, like cookies!  And he wants meat!  Do you understand?  Huge, delicious steak - that's what he needs!  That's what he ordered!  And not cookies, sauces, snacks and beer! <br><br>  - Well, transparency has increased, you yourself said how comfortable it was to evaluate the remainder of the project.  - as if nothing had happened, continued John.  - I'm talking about storypoints. <br><br>  - I'm talking about storypoints.  - mocked Bob, then returned to a more serious tone.  - Of course, the benefits of the joint venture is, and I would like to leave them, even when we throw scrum. <br><br>  - Exactly throw out?  Asked John, frowning.  ‚ÄúAfter all, there is so much benefit from it, for example ...‚Äù <br><br>  - Right, John.  - Bob nodded.  - Scrum is dead.  And we, and in general.  There is no benefit from it.  It was a dummy. <br><br>  - It seems to me that it is early to draw conclusions, at least, only on the basis of the work of my team.  - answered John. <br><br>  - And I'm not just judging by your team.  - shrug Bob.  - Do you remember the consultants? <br><br>  - Yes. <br><br>  - They stuck with us for three months, and in the end they said that we had the right scrum.  - smiled Bob.  - But, no matter how much I talk to them, they could not answer me exactly, how could I do projects faster, after all?  Do you understand?  They have behind them - years of working with this methodology, hundreds of projects and teams, some kind of certificates are issued, but what's the point? <br><br>  It seems that these are some sectarians, and moreover - at the level of a kindergarten.  With you, developers, they are great at talking - you‚Äôll hang your ears, open your mouth, and listen to tales of how you‚Äôll have fun, fun, and fun. <br><br>  And when serious people, like me, talk with these sectarians and the topic of conversation is money, and not ephemeral projects, services, products and construction points, they immediately get lost, dodge, almost run off. <br><br>  - Yes, I understand.  - John nodded. <br><br>  - He understands.  - grinned Bob.  - I also went to the seminar - well, where they gather businessmen and directors, like me, and treat me on how good scrum is, how it will increase profitability, the speed of project closure, how we will drive everyone to the coffin.  And you know what? <br><br>  - What? <br><br>  ‚ÄúAh ... nothing.‚Äù  - raised his eyebrows Bob.  - There, of course, a lot of people were new, this is their favorite audience, they can cram their crazy ideas into their heads. <br><br>  But there were people like me.  Do you know how to distinguish such?  By sight, by a mixture of hope and despair.  We come to such events to find!  Anything to find, you know?  Find what we missed.  Find those who succeeded in something - not your boards with stickers to hang out, but in business, you earned more money! <br><br>  Find yourself, yourself, an excuse in the end!  Well, I can not be such an idiot, who gave a lot of money for hell, understand that, I did not get anything useful in return, except for another toy for developers and team leaders!  Do you understand?  This is a very painful, oppressive, unpleasant feeling, and it is impossible to hide it. <br><br>  Someone, of course, continues to zombie himself - hey, I'm fine!  I have a scram!  But it is up to the first booze.  I went, then, after the seminar, to the bar, hooked up to one - which are also a eggey, and what would you think?  After two bottles of whiskey, everything fell into place.  The same problem, the same uncomprehending look, almost tears, understand?  Everyone understands that he bought a cat in a bag, spent the money of the owner, and now he is ashamed to look into his eyes. <br><br>  And the nastiest thing - no one has enough courage to throw this cat away and drown it, along with the bag!  And these creatures, psychologists are crap, they understand this!  Even as they understand!  That's why more and more money is being rowed, all the while pushing the horizon away - do not be afraid, hey, everything will be fine!  Scrum develops!  Does not work?  Nothing wrong!  Here, try this method!  It goes well with Scum!  Here, just sign here ... And we are waiting for the prepayment. <br><br>  - And you, it turns out, have enough courage?  - smiled John. <br><br>  - I have enough common sense.  - shrug Bob.  - I am the same employee as you.  If you healed me, I won‚Äôt be able to heal Don, I won‚Äôt even try.  Not the right person.  Too ... Normal.  Simple, straightforward.  And can count money.  Plus - we are not his only business.  The rest, as you know, are not related to the IT and the web. <br><br>  - I see.  - John nodded.  - So what is the result? <br><br>  - Do not you understand?  - raised his eyebrows Bob. <br><br>  - Got it, but I want to hear from you.  - shrugged John.  - And then again I do not understand.  Scrum - everything? <br><br>  - Scrum is dead.  For us.  - with a serious look said Bob.  ‚ÄúI don't want to hear anything more about him.‚Äù  To the evening there were no boards on the walls. <br><br>  - How to work?  - John frowned. <br><br>  - Simply.  Fine.  Work.  - chasing every word, said Bob. <br><br>  - I see.  - John nodded.  - Everything? <br><br>  - Everything. <br><br>  John got up from his chair and walked toward the exit.  When he reached the door, he stopped because he heard Bob's voice. <br><br>  - Think with your head, John. <br><br>  PS Do you need a continuation? </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/425411/">https://habr.com/ru/post/425411/</a></p>
