It was in our country that state of emergency became so normal that it took a special ministry. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Started a wave of accidents.  Bridges will fall, train derailment, buildings collapse, weapons depots, etc., explode.  The safety margin specified in the USSR ends.

      In Moscow, it is not as noticeable as in provincial cities.  Yes, they are building new shops, houses for the rich, but bridges, railways (many branches are simply dismantled for scrap), ordinary houses - everything is becoming unusable. <br><br>  And provincial hospitals are terrible!  I wish you never get there.  If you had an accident and you have no relatives to buy blood, plasma and drugs, then you are a corpse.  I saw it with my own eyes. <br><br>  I am writing because of grief.  It's hard to watch this.  We are not pawns.  An idea becomes omnipotent if it masters the masses. <br><br>  Naturally, all this trouble because of the government, which instead of investing money in improving the country's infrastructure, invests them <br><br>  1. in the purchase of pieces of paper (dollars and euros) <br>  2. the economy of foreign countries (buying stocks) <br>  3. in the pockets of the oligarchs <br>  4. corrupt officials (approximately 30% of the budget of the Russian Federation goes to kickbacks, which receive officials) <br><br>  Officials are justified by the fact that if you sell dollars and do something for rubles, there will be a big dollar inflation.  But many of the money is still still stored in dollars. <br><br>  I think that not many in general have substantial savings, especially in dollars.  Just in this way, the government saves its own money and fulfills the will of the American comrades, fearing to go into conflict with them. <br><br>  The justification is: if dollars are cheaper, then our exports will become more expensive and will be less purchased.  Russia's main exports are oil and other natural resources. <br><br>  What is becoming less and less can only become cheaper if forced democratization is conducted (as was done with Iraq).  In the meantime, the Soviet Union‚Äôs weapons didn‚Äôt fall apart. <br><br>  I have a principle that criticism should be constructive, i.e.  carry options and possible solutions to the problem. <br><br>  My suggestion about the stabilization fund is (I‚Äôll not talk about oligarchs yet): you need to buy equipment for hospitals, build (even if with Turkish hands) roads, carry gas to villages, conduct Internet everywhere, buy computers for schools. <br></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/5594/">https://habr.com/ru/post/5594/</a></p>
