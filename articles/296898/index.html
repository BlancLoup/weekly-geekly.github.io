      For the article, thanks to the authors of the blog about system Internet marketing <a href="http://kirgorshkov.pro/">Kirgorshkov.pro</a> .  This blog is a project of <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kirgorshkov/ru">Kira Gorshkov</a> , an expert in building system-based internet marketing for business. <br><br><h4>  Battle for attention </h4><br><br>  The inhabitant of the civilized world is surrounded by such an amount of advertising that he has long learned to ignore it.  Well, except from boredom, when for some reason you can not stick to your smartphone on the way to work or home.  Informational satiety in highly competitive markets forces companies to strive for the attention of every potential customer.  Who was able to emerge from the muddy river monotonous advertising and, flashing an interesting idea or form of presentation in the sun, to catch the eye of the consumer, he won.  The same fully applies to advertising on the Internet. <br><br>  The text is no longer read, but ‚Äúscanned‚Äù.  Your potential client (and maybe you are now), putting his chin in his hand, lazily scrolls the page.  His gaze wanders across the screen, tracing the F-pattern.  Sigh, click ... the page is closed.  This does not always mean that the page had a bad text, an outdated design or a curved layout.  The person simply did not concentrate, did not direct his attention in the direction you need.  This happens all the time.  How to cope with such a problem? <br><br>  <i>Article in the topic - <a href="http://boosta.ru/content-marketing/prokachaj-kontent-marketing-16-rabochix-sposobov-chast-1/">Upgrade content marketing: 16 working methods.</a></i>  <i><a href="http://boosta.ru/content-marketing/prokachaj-kontent-marketing-16-rabochix-sposobov-chast-1/">Part 1</a></i> <br><br>  One of the most effective ways to get visitor attention is to use video.  After all, it is able to possess the attention of a person more effectively than text or static graphics.  The reasons are rooted in our physiology.  When watching a video, information passes through two channels: visual and auditory.  Accordingly, a person willy-nilly has to include attention in order to understand the meaning of what is happening.  In addition, the contemplation of a moving image requires more concentration than a static picture. <br><br>  According <a href="http://www.prweb.com/releases/2012/9/prweb9890824.htm">to the agency MediaMind</a> , CTR online video exceeds the CTR advertising banners in 27.5 times. <br><br>  Another advantage of video content lies in the fact that when watching a movie a person is not under stress.  Information is transmitted to him as if by itself, without conscious effort on his part.  To read the text a person needs to strain.  He can be relaxed to watch the video.  For this reason, after seeing the video embedded in the page, a person is likely to click on it.  He knows that watching a movie is effortless.  A good way to get distracted.  In addition, what if an interesting video? <br><br>  A strong effect is achieved if you play on the contrast: embed in the page clip, which is stylistically different from the rest of the content on the site.  This is the trick we did with the <a href="http://lp.altis-lift.com/%3Futm_source%3Dboosta.ru%2520guest%2520article%26utm_medium%3Dboosta.ru%2520guest%2520article%26utm_term%3Dboosta.ru%2520guest%2520article%26utm_content%3Dboosta.ru%2520guest%2520article%26utm_campaign%3Dboosta.ru%2520guest%2520article">landing page of the company Altis-Lift</a> , which is engaged in the sale of elevator equipment and related services.  We posted on the page mounted from the animated series Happy Tree Friends video.  This is a black humor cartoon about the misadventures of cute forest animals.  The plot is unpretentious - everyday situations entail getting into terrible alterations.  In our case, this situation was the banal use of the elevator. <br><br>  ‚ÄúWant to save money by ordering a cheap elevator model?  That's what can happen in this case, ‚Äù- says the inscription above the roller.  Its primary task is to break the template that a visitor has formed after viewing dozens of strict B2B sites. <br><br><br><br>  The fact is that Altis-Lift work in a B2B niche with a long sales cycle and the high cost of a single transaction.  Lifts do not order interest for the sake of or out of boredom.  They are ordered because a business has such a need.  Her satisfaction is work, not entertainment.  Accordingly, the person viewing the page was at work.  Sipping corporate coffee, he scrolls the next page with elevators.  The face is serious, maybe bored. <br><br>  And here, quite suddenly, next to the numbers, characteristics and quality guarantees, an entertaining video appears about the near-beasts and the elevator that has flown from its coils.  What happens in this case?  The person unknowingly distinguishes this site against the background of competitors who have taken adjacent tabs.  Without knowing it, he remembers this page, even if the memory is based on the phrase ‚Äúmoose and elevator‚Äù.  This option is also suitable for us, and soon we will tell you why. <br><br><h4>  Explain to me how it works. </h4><br><br>  Or here's another option.  Suppose a visitor has come to your site who suits your service.  Right here is your potential customer who is a sin to miss.  But the problem is that the service is complicated.  You perfectly understand her, you can make out to the screw, but the client has no idea about this device.  How to convey to him the necessary knowledge and, most importantly, how to explain that the service will be useful to him.  You can paint the service point by point, in the hope that the person will not give up on the middle and with the words ‚ÄúOh well, it's all too complicated, too dull‚Äù will not close the page.  And you can place an explanatory video. <br><br>  In video marketing, such content is called an expliner.  Its purpose is to analyze a complex sentence in order to make it understandable or to increase its value in the eyes of the consumer.  Video copes with this purpose best of all, because it owns the attention of the consumer and can show him in detail the device of the product and the benefits that this product guarantees to him. <br><br>  <i>Article in topic - <a href="http://kirgorshkov.pro/mainmarketologwanted/%3Futm_source%3Dboosta.ru%2520guest%2520article%26utm_medium%3Dboosta.ru%2520guest%2520article%26utm_term%3Dboosta.ru%2520guest%2520article%26utm_content%3Dboosta.ru%2520guest%2520article%26utm_campaign%3Dboosta.ru%2520guest%2520article">How to hire a key internet marketer</a></i> <br><br>  That's exactly what Dropbox did.  In the first year of its existence, she made the landing page, where there was only a button ‚ÄúDownload Dropbox‚Äù and a 120-second video, announcing the principle of the service. <br><br><br><br>  <b>Result?</b> <br><br>  The number of conversions and registrations in Dropbox increased by 10%. <br><br>  (By the way, there is a way to increase the volume of Dropbox storage for free and legally. We told about it in the article ‚ÄúHow we downloaded Dropbox‚Äù) <br><br>  <b>Another plus of the expliner is that it can be combined with other techniques.</b>  <b>For example, with personification:</b> <br><br><br><br>  In this video made by our division <a href="http://www.infovideo.pro/%3Futm_source%3Dboosta.ru%2520guest%2520article%26utm_medium%3Dboosta.ru%2520guest%2520article%26utm_term%3Dboosta.ru%2520guest%2520article%26utm_content%3Dboosta.ru%2520guest%2520article%26utm_campaign%3Dboosta.ru%2520guest%2520article">infovideo.pro</a> , we explained how the product works and what advantages it gives to a specific user.  For this, we used the collective image of such a user and modeled a specific problem that the product would help solve.  Everything is done so that the potential client, having watched the video, snapping his fingers, said, ‚ÄúGosh, this is about us!‚Äù. <br><br>  <b>Let's summarize.</b> <br><br><ul><li>  Video captures the visitor's attention better than text or pictures. </li><li>  For the perception of the video does not need to make an effort. </li><li>  Video can easily and simply explain how the product and or service is arranged. </li><li>  The consumer can identify himself with the characters of the video, thereby understanding what his need will satisfy a particular product. </li></ul><br><br>  <i>Article in the topic - <a href="http://boosta.ru/growth-hacking/a-vy-znaete-chto-takoe-growth-hacking-11-kejsov-vnutri/">Do you know what Growth Hacking is?</a></i>  <i><a href="http://boosta.ru/growth-hacking/a-vy-znaete-chto-takoe-growth-hacking-11-kejsov-vnutri/">11 cases inside</a></i> <br><br><h4>  <b>Search Engines Love Videos</b> </h4><br><br>  Video can demonstrate even greater efficiency if properly optimized for search engines.  After all, a movie is not an isolated object embedded in the foundation of the page.  No, this is a separate content element that is seen and analyzed by search engine robots Google and Yandex.  Therefore, the keywords placed in the annotation to the video, in its title and description significantly increase the likelihood that search engines will notice and love it. <br><br>  Do not forget about the subtitles - they are also indexed.  Fortunately, creating subtitles for video is now much simpler than before.  This is because today in YouTube there is a function for automatically creating subtitles - the service ‚Äúlistens‚Äù to the audio track and forms subtitles with correctly arranged timings on its basis.  The accuracy of transcription is usually lame (especially in Russian), but errors can be corrected manually. <br><br>  There is a theory that Google can independently ‚Äúscan‚Äù an audio track to a video on YouTube.  It is impossible to say exactly what he does or not, because Google does not disclose its search secrets.  But the fact that the service has such a function and it can use it is certain for certain.  So do not forget to add keywords to the video, even if you do not plan to do subtitles. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/9f9/747/5df/9f97475dfecf457f88fd001e370e8ce9.jpg"><br><br>  But back to our sheep, or rather, to the elk with an elevator.  After watching this video, the associative row of the landing page visitor has slightly changed.  Next to the concept of ‚Äúordering elevators,‚Äù a new one has appeared, which can sound either like ‚Äúelevator Happy Tree Friends‚Äù or ‚Äúelk and elevator‚Äù.  This is important for a specific reason, which follows from the <a href="http://kirgorshkov.pro/b2b_klienti_v_internete/%3Futm_source%3Dboosta.ru%2520guest%2520article%26utm_medium%3Dboosta.ru%2520guest%2520article%26utm_term%3Dboosta.ru%2520guest%2520article%26utm_content%3Dboosta.ru%2520guest%2520article%26utm_campaign%3Dboosta.ru%2520guest%2520article">specifics of the B2B market</a> .  Impulsive purchases are not made on it.  The purchasing department or technical director will not order the elevators on the first site that came to hand.  Instead, a process will follow, during which dozens of options will be reviewed, and the decision process will take more than one week.  The client will not place an order for 50 thousand USD.  just because I saw a funny video on the company's website that raised his spirits.  This video does not even pursue such a goal. <br><br>  But this video helps to distinguish the company from the competition.  She will have a chip, a peculiarity, an emotional element - that which her rivals are deprived of.  In addition, the video will simplify the search when you need to once again consider the proposals.  The name Altis-Lift is easy to forget.  A funny video is not so easy. <br><br>  Therefore, we called our video ‚ÄúAltis-lift (Elevator and moose from Happy Tree Friends)‚Äù, placing a link to the Altis-Lift website in the description, and at the same time one of the key requests. <br><br>  As the analyst shows, this technique worked.  The block with the video on the site turned out to be one of the most viewed.  He perfectly complemented the rest of the content on the page, which, by the way, led the customer to 74 lead.  And this is in a narrow B2B niche with a long sales cycle and an average check of 50 thousand USD. <br><br>  <b>Summing up:</b> <br><br><ul><li>  When posting videos on YouTube, type keywords in the title, annotations, and descriptions. </li><li>  It is advisable to include keywords in the text of the video and add subtitles. </li><li>  The user may not remember the name of the company or brand, but can remember the video associated with them. </li></ul><br><br>  <i>Article in the topic - <a href="http://boosta.ru/web-analytics/oni-pomogut-najti-vsex-ubijc-konversii-10-otchyotov-v-google-analytics/">They will help you find all the "killers" of conversion - 10 reports in Google Analytics</a></i> <br><br><h4>  <b>Do not forget about Facebook</b> </h4><br><br>  Speaking of ‚Äúvideo on the Internet‚Äù, many mean only ‚Äúvideo on YouTube‚Äù, forgetting about the serious competitor of this service - Facebook.  Tubular's statistics <a href="http://www.reelseo.com/facebook-video-day-one-youtube-long-term/">show</a> that in June 2015 alone, 8.5 thousand videos were posted on Facebook, giving a total of 28.3 billion views.  The YouTube rate for the same period of time is slightly less than 6 thousand videos that have been viewed 14.2 billion times. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/1b8/225/60a/1b822560acab42fa930343db363c3a20.png"><br><br>  Thus, Facebook is even ahead of YouTube in the number of video views.  This was achieved thanks to the autoplay feature, which is enabled by default in Facebook.  This is one of the reasons why 50% of all videos posted on Facebook are viewed on the very first day.  For YouTube, this figure is only 20%. <br><br>  Such indicators also have a downside: the life cycle of videos on Facebook is less than on YouTube - a sharp surge in views at the start is followed by a no less dramatic drop in popularity, down to complete oblivion.  This is due to the fact that YouTube has an arsenal of tools for extending the video life cycle (sections with watched and ‚Äúclicked‚Äù videos, reminders to watch again, subscriptions, and so on).  At the same time, Facebook does not yet have such capabilities. <br><br>  That is why short, maximally rich videos are perfect for Facebook.  For example, for this you can use the mounted fragments of the main video posted on YouTube from which all the ‚Äúextra‚Äù was thrown out.  Creating videos specifically for Facebook, while ignoring YouTube is a bad idea. <br><br>  See what video for the social network makes one of our clients (Coca-Cola).  The video on the company‚Äôs Facebook page is mostly short (less than 30 seconds).  Some videos are collected from frames of advertising that the company created for TV or YouTube.  For example, the famous video with ‚ÄúChristmas trucks‚Äù. <br><br>  <b>Summarizing all of the above, let's say that there are no secrets of effective promotion through video marketing as such.</b>  <b>But there are clear rules:</b> <br><br><ul><li>  Make or order high-quality and interesting video content for your target audience. </li><li>  Optimize video for search engines. </li><li>  Stay tuned for new features that YouTube and Facebook are embedding.  And use these features. </li><li>  Following these points, you will achieve the maximum return from the video, which will positively affect the attendance and the number of leads left on the pages of your company or brand.  As a result, it will increase the number of orders and company profits. </li></ul><br><br>  More information about video marketing in particular and about Internet marketing in general, you can find on the blog pages and in the <a href="http://kirgorshkov.pro/download/%3Futm_source%3Dboosta.ru%2520guest%2520article%26utm_medium%3Dboosta.ru%2520guest%2520article%26utm_term%3Dboosta.ru%2520guest%2520article%26utm_content%3Dboosta.ru%2520guest%2520article%26utm_campaign%3Dboosta.ru%2520guest%2520article">section</a> for downloading materials. <br><br>  If you have a need to develop video, please contact our video department <a href="http://www.infovideo.pro/">infovideo.pro</a> . <br><br>  Read also our other popular articles: <br><br>  1. <a href="http://megamozg.ru/company/changeagain/blog/19126/">They will help you find all the conversion killers - 10 reports in Google Analytics</a> (6000+ views) <br>  2. <a href="http://megamozg.ru/company/changeagain/blog/19542/">100 ideas for A / B testing.</a>  <a href="http://megamozg.ru/company/changeagain/blog/19542/">Part One</a> (2500+ views) <br>  3. <a href="http://megamozg.ru/company/changeagain/blog/19548/">100 ideas for A / B testing: Part Two</a> (1500+ views) <br>  4. <a href="http://megamozg.ru/company/changeagain/blog/19686/">How to find an idea for an A / B test: heat maps and polls</a> (1000+ views) <br>  5. <a href="http://megamozg.ru/company/changeagain/blog/20258/">Get to know your target audience or die: 34 vital questions</a> (2000+ views) <br>  6.
