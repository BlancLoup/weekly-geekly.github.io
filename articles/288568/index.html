In addition to the sad news that Fellini and Chaplin, unfortunately, have died. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Our mega-monster portal again <a href="http://content.tut.by/">holds a competition for</a> Belarusian content projects.  Do I have to tell you that if you have a blog or a site with interesting content, then you simply must participate in it?  At the moment, this is generally the only contest remaining in Bynet.  And since we are busy here with interesting sites, then you have every chance to win.  Somewhere I read the opinion that it is considered normal for us to invest 2-3 thousand dollars in the development of the site and $ 0 in its content.  That's why we have beautiful, but empty sites.  And in general, participation in contests stimulates, tones and invigorates.  It's a pity that the rewards are not very big.

      Want to find your friends on the social networks, but do not want to view each from cover to cover?  We will help you!  <a href="http://upscoop.com/">upscoop.com</a> is a cool free service that searches for your friends in all significant social networks!  You just need to enter your e-mail - and upscoop will search by e-mail from your address book.  Well, if this is not enough for you, you can enter the addresses to search manually. <br><br>  "Yandex" seriously took up blogs.  First, it earned a <a href="http://pda.blogs.yandex.ru/">version of the search for blogs on mobile devices</a> .  That is, the owners of the CCP will be able to learn about the most interesting in the blogosphere, wherever they are.  Secondly, a <a href="http://yaca.blogs.yandex.ru/yca">diary directory has</a> opened, sorted by blog topics and similar in structure to Yandex.Catalog.  By what principle and who sorted blogs in the directory is not very clear, in any case, I did not find such information.  Is it possible to manually? <br><br>  I am glad that social networks began to be created in our homeland.  And they do not copy successful Western ideas, such as social bookmarks, but embody their own.  The social network <a href="http://cream.by/">Cream.By</a> announced the start of a public testing relying press release.  We are informed that this social network is created to unite people who like to have a good time.  Users of the system will be able to plan joint holidays, discuss events in the cultural and entertainment life of Minsk, invite each other to restaurants and cinema.  Well, it will be possible to talk about the results in a month, but for now let's test! <br><br>  For a long time I did not refer to the stand alone blogs in my reviews.  Meanwhile, our old friend Yury Shilyaev has published two very interesting and, most importantly, controversial articles on his blog over the past week.  First, ‚Äú <a href="http://yuri.shilyaev.com/archives/2007/03/06/353/kuda-zh-ponyat-barinu.html">Where can I understand the master!</a> ‚Äù - that we do not know how to negotiate with the employer.  I do not agree with some theses in this article, because it was written from the position of the employer, but the text still leads to certain reflections.  Perhaps it is worth something to change in their behavior.  Secondly, ‚Äú <a href="http://yuri.shilyaev.com/archives/2007/03/12/354/rabotat-%25C2%25ABna-dyadyu%25C2%25BB-ah-kak-eto-uzhasno.html">To work‚Äú for an uncle</a> . ‚ÄùOh, how terrible it is!‚Äù Is, in fact, a continuation of the theme of the relationship between workers and employers.  Only in this case, Yuri washes the bones of freelancers.  The conclusion of the article, again, is pleasant for the employer: ‚ÄúBut many, going into freelancing, freeze in the middle of this path.  And their enterprises do not know how to organize, and they do not want to work for anyone.  Money is in your pocket, but there is no clear idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe future.  Knowledge is there, but adjacent experience is not growing.  It takes about two years, and this rebel is hired back.  To "uncle". " <br><br>  They ask me in letters how I manage to find so much interesting in the blogosphere.  It's very simple - I am a sick person, conducting on the Internet about 22 hours a day.  So actually I still find very little.  But I have a ‚Äú <a href="http://mr-pif.livejournal.com/99481.html">How to search for treasures</a> ‚Äù tutorial for you.  Article-recommendation for those who want to find in blogs more interesting and useful information and less grafomansky garbage.  No thanks, transfer money to my account in the Zhlobin branch of Belarusbank. <br><br>  Which of us sometimes doesn‚Äôt run a game on your computer?  Do you remember how in childhood we couldn‚Äôt be torn away from a computer and a TV with a prefix?  When they gave me a computer, I spent a day behind it, thankfully, it was a weekend and my parents left somewhere.  And from the gaming press read the cult "Game.EXE".  And even earlier, at the dawn of prefixation, there was such a wonderful magazine ‚ÄúDendy New Reality‚Äù.  And there was in it a column of letters from grateful readers, called ‚ÄúI am writing to you ...‚Äù.  Selected pearls from this rubric, almost a whole hundred of the best master lamarasms, are <a href="http://enuckon.livejournal.com/6337.html">now available to the</a> general public!  For example: " <em>I want to ask. Does the Sega CD-X prefix exist, by inserting a video tape and a laser disk into it, after a couple of minutes the disc will contain a game based on the movie that was on the video tape? Anton Chernyavsky, Krasnoyarsk Territory</em> ". <br><br>  ‚ÄúAll professions are important!‚Äù - the farmer and taxidermist will chant and take care of their professional duties.  But Old Kamrad proudly declares: ‚Äú <a href="http://neman-grodno.livejournal.com/827.html">I am a Tester!</a> ‚Äù And he not only declares, but calmly, point by point, makes himself respected: ‚ÄúThis is work.  Like any other, it is stupidly monotonous, and sometimes - it delays with the head and other parts of the body.  You may not even know what a tester drive is!  Funny  In vain. <br><br>  Well, for all men who survived the four weekends, which began with the terrible March 8th, the last two links in this review.  First, the famous TV and radio host Sergey Stillavin talks <a href="http://stillavinsergei.livejournal.com/15750.html">about the call on the eve of women's day</a> .  The message provoked a heated discussion - only six pages of comments.  The main theme is the loneliness of the bitches: " <em>Stillavin, this is me - Stasya! Now you will congratulate me on the 8th of March, because everyone else wants me, but you do not want me! Well, congratulations soon!</em> ".  And then Evgeny Smirnov mens onli publishes " <a href="http://e-smirnov.livejournal.com/517345.html">Instructions for the celebration of March 8</a> ".  Perhaps it is worth printing and saving until the next holiday, and then strictly follow the instructions.  " <em>As soon as you, waking up in the morning and carefully looking at the woman, realized that you like, you can consider yourself vengeful. You received a gift that costs more than all the colors, plush toys and restaurants</em> ." <br><br>  Do you like going to interviews?  And how employers like to listen to those who came for an interview!  An entire series of " <a href="http://ru-dailywtf.livejournal.com/40213.html">Tales from the interviews</a> " on The Daily WTF blog in Russian.  Someone laughs, but someone this link will help to behave at the interview correctly.  By the way, please pay close attention to this whole blog.  It publishes translations into Russian of humorous articles about programs, programmers and technologies from the website <a href="http://worsethanfailure.com/">worsethanfailure.com</a> .  So pleasant reading you provided. <br><br>  The Bender robot from the American animated series ‚ÄúFuturama‚Äù became the hero of our time, and its sacramental ‚ÄúKill all humans!‚Äù Is the motto.  The following link is dedicated to all the well-deserved paranoids and lovers of the world conspiracy.  Lapinuar talks <a href="http://community.livejournal.com/agitplakat/907665.html">about a bot program</a> that can independently create blog posts and respond to comments adequately.  The author's conclusion is: " <em>As the customer said then," other programs will be created, "like this, so if the behavior of some LJ-ista seems strange to you, then maybe you are dealing with a bot. I recommend to stop communicating with Immediately, since it‚Äôs a waste of time - do not repeat my mistakes!</em> " <br><br>  Many major blogs have grown into social resources.  Open access to adding content, integration (borrowing) from YouTube, Flickr and Wiki.  The scheme is simple - a blog (splog) for 3-4 months is brought to 6-7 unique visits, then plug-ins are put in, allowing users to post content, and after a few months, we have a full social link.  This simple truth is revealed to us by the <a href="http://adne.info/evolyutsiya-blogov-%25E2%2580%2593-web-20-nastupaet">ADNE</a> blog.  Who will adopt?  Report your experience later. <br><br>  The <a href="http://adblogs.ru/">AdBlogs.ru</a> project began its work, designed to help advertisers and bloggers find each other.  Without demanding any compensation from the authors, the administration of the service promises them anonymity, pricing advice and fee-based transactions (whatever that means).  The creators of AdBlogs also took care of the conscience of bloggers.  The service FAQ on the ‚Äúmoral side of the question‚Äù states the following: ‚ÄúYes, you are paid for it - and so what?  If your friend recommends buying something in a store where he works and receives a salary, is this necessarily a hoax? ‚Äù  With regard to the rules of blogging sites, the "implicit" advertising restrictions, according to AdBlogs, do not apply. <br><br>  And another contest in which every blogger should participate!  The name, however, the organizers stole from this review, but I forgive them.  The literary award " <a href="http://www.blogbaster.ru/">Blogbuster</a> " will be awarded for works created on blogs and on websites.  The creators consider it the first Russian premium in this area.  In a press release on the occasion of the opening of "Blogbuster" it is said that this competition will become a domestic analogue of the bourgeois Bluker Prize.  The creative must be published on a blog or website, must be at least 20 thousand characters, but not more than 400 thousand characters, as well as be a complete prose work.  I will definitely declare some story for the award, and then I will tell you about the results. <br><br>  Let's see what is happening in our Palestine.  And here Vsevolod Volkov <a href="http://vsevolod-volkov.livejournal.com/251293.html">talks</a> about a new round of the Belarusian oligarchy.  The essence of the conflict is that several months ago, Webcom studio made a new design for the Date.By website.  The design, by some estimates, turned out to be suspiciously similar to the design of the site TUT.BY.  Then offended TUT.BY removed Webcom from the results of its search.  But now Webcom was offended ... Vsevolod mixed an article, comments of opponents and banners-assaults in one post.  Actually, the next fight in our local sandbox, and we look and have fun. <br><br>  The following link will be interesting to those who like to write in their LiveJournal "under lock and key", and to those who want to <a href="http://my-xcalibur.livejournal.com/16874.html">read</a> it <a href="http://my-xcalibur.livejournal.com/16874.html">under lock and key</a> .  Castle in LJ - stupid thing.  You know, friends, everything that you write under the lock, you can safely read.  The castle is suitable for posting stupid flash mobs that are aimed at people you really know in real life.  If you, of course, have a group of friends a la "I know personally".  Learn to be hackers and Yandex to help us! <br><br>  <a href="http://anton.livejournal.com/83754.html">And the last news</a> that was secretly told to me in my blog by the Blog Search Manager from Yandex Anton Volnukhin: ‚Äú <em>In the LiveJournal, finally, robots that are massively adding as friends have ended. Now you can add no more than a few friends to the day a hundred people</em> . "  And it does not matter that for the majority of Russian users of LJ the problem of bots is associated with the toster account, which turned out to be an optimization project of Anton Volnukhin himself, who unwound in a couple of months before being included in the top 20 most read users in LJ.  Later, he expanded the list of friends with his account toster_star.  As a result, the word ‚Äútoaster‚Äù has become a household name, and in the <a href="http://community.livejournal.com/ru_antitoster">Order of the Toaster Destroyers</a> community, links to a growing army of bots are regularly published. <br><br>  <b>Blogographer Lyaksey Khaletsky-Bangalore</b> <br><br>  <a href="http://kv.by/index2007120601.htm">Published in "Computer News" (‚Ññ12, 2007)</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/288568/">https://habr.com/ru/post/288568/</a></p>
