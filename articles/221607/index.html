  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Imagine Cup 2014. How it was</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Dear Habrahabr, hello! <br>  The Russian final of the Imagine Cup 2014 has just recently ended. I would like to share with you my impressions of this competition, as well as tell about our project.  Since Habr is a technical community, I decided to divide the article into two parts: a short history of our team and a technical story about our project and the idea itself. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Geek.Three team in brief</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  Our team consists of 3 Siberian graduate students, the team was formed in the 3rd year of university, and during this time we participated each year in the competition for ImCup software projects, as well as in many other competitions.  During this time we took prizes in some competitions, the scope of our projects is approximately as follows: <br><ol><li>  A software project for auditing an enterprise‚Äôs information security within the framework of the Federal Law 152 ‚ÄúOn the protection of personal data‚Äù; </li><li>  SaveFood - reading the barcode of the goods in the supermarket using the phone and getting to know the composition of the product with simple words - ‚ÄúHow harmful are these components of the product?‚Äù; </li><li>  NotAlone - a project for lonely people, to find friends by interests; </li><li>  Katrina is a cross-platform application for monitoring teen suicidal activity on social networks and instantly notifying their parents about it. </li></ol><br>  There were many other projects and freelancing, but I tried to tell the reader only those projects for which a lot of time was spent. <br>  In February 2014 we took the second place at the regional finals of ImCup in Tomsk, and could not count on participating in the Russian finals.  But shortly before the final we received a message from <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/shwars/" class="user_link">shwars</a> with the subject ‚ÄúImagine Cup Russian Finals‚Äù.  Preparations for the finals began, because after the regional finals in the near future we did not plan to participate in other competitions, the work on the project was a little faded, but after the good news, we had to put a huge amount of energy to make up for lost time. <br></div></div><br><h5>  About the project. </h5><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/70f/fbd/5bd/70ffbd5bdbc2785d91782bed85f943c5.png"><br><br>  The main idea is to implement a cross-platform application to monitor the suicidal activity of adolescents in social networks and immediately notify their parents about this.  Parents, due to the large employment at work, do not always have the opportunity to independently monitor the activity of their children.  Our application allows you to constantly monitor public information (statuses, posts) and check for words related to suicidal activity. <br>  Then such posts are sent to parents as Push-notifications, and parents already decide what to do next.  In the implementation plans, add functionality that, in case of danger, would offer the nearest psychological centers to which you can ask for qualified help in such situations. <br>  The following platforms were used to implement the idea: <br><ul><li>  Windows phone </li><li>  Windows 8 </li><li>  Windows Azure </li><li>  Sentimental Analysis </li></ul><br>  Under Windows Phone, we are programming from the release of the very first public SDK and already have sufficient experience with this platform.  There was also extensive experience with the Windows Azure platform, since it was almost impossible to use it in Russia.  Windows Azure is used as a backend for our application, and initially the task was to consolidate received posts from the social network, as well as storing the thesaurus of keywords, checking posts, authenticating and sending Push notifications.  With the analysis of tonality - more difficult, none of us have previously used similar algorithms, and therefore, much work is needed in the future to study it. <br>  At the first stage of implementation, we decided to focus on the social network Vkontakte, since a huge number of teenagers use this social network, but also prepared the functionality for connecting other APIs such as Twitter, Facebook, Tumblr and Odnoklassniki, in order to connect additional functionality to the project was not so painful. <br>  Initially, the project used its thesaurus to check for keywords from posts received from the social network, which informed the user that a negative word was used.  Subsequently, a flat classification was used and, in the event of a coincidence, a push message was sent to the keywords that installed the application with a post classification: positive, negative, neutral. <br>  In the future, it was decided to send a Push-notification only if the color of the message becomes ‚Äúnegative‚Äù in order not to bomb with spam, since  Teens often have a lot of information on their pages in the social.  networks.  You can view all messages, for example, per day by opening the application and viewing the status of the social network icon. <br>  After we were informed about the participation in the Russian final, we had to urgently refine the functionality.  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/shwars/" class="user_link">shwars</a> advised to create a test account in the social network in order to visually demonstrate the operation of the application, at the same time it was decided to shift the burden of responsibility for determining the color of the text on tonality analysis algorithms (an excellent article on this topic is <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/149605/">here</a> ).  Since we had no time left to implement and test such algorithms, it was decided to use a ready-made solution, AlchemyAPI was involved in this capacity, and during testing it was she who gave the best results.  The only problem at the time was that this API did not work with the Russian language, and for the demonstration we had to use posts written in English.

    <h5>  What's next </h5><br>  Despite the fact that in the Russian final we did not succeed in winning a top place, we are ready to continue working on this project with the children, in the near future we plan to open our Github repository for public access and hope that we can involve the community in the joint development of this project .  After the competition, we received a proposal to implement the project under the Windows-desktop, and therefore in the near future we will work in this direction. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Conclusion and thanks</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  In conclusion, I would like to thank Microsoft for holding such a competition and the opportunity to participate, as well as <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/shwars/" class="user_link">shwars</a> for their support and advice.  In fact, we believe that ImCup is a great opportunity not only to express yourself and demonstrate your project, but also a great opportunity to communicate with students and graduate students all over Russia, communicating at similar contests with participants, you realize that everything is not so bad as it seems at first glance! <br>  Special thanks to my colleagues and, in particular, <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/kozt/" class="user_link">kozt</a> for understanding and support! <br></div></div></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/221607/">https://habr.com/ru/post/221607/</a></p>
