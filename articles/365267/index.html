    <a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  ‚ÄúSandwiches must be made in the morning, because there will be nothing at lunch‚Äù </h2><br>  People's stories about what they overheard at the IT conference, and then really used in practice - indecent total post-factum (b).  In my humble preconceived experience, at best, the respondents (and I among the rest) reported on the class atmosphere and suggested that the conference was professionally useful to someone (front-end, smart, more), but not to them personally, to the respondents. <br><br>  As for me, something needs to be done about it.  And that's what is being proposed. <br><br><h2>  Everything is a project </h2><br>  We want for ourselves the maximum benefit from the conference - recorded.  What tools to extract his cherished, maximum benefits, we already know?  For example, to the best of their IT competencies. <br><br>  Bingo: tools from the magic toolbox "Project Approach".  All sorts of scrum, ling and other agyle.  Once all this wisdom came to us from non-italian branches of life and leisure (bow to Mr. Deming, Goldratt and their friends).  Why not put these things outside of IT again? <br><br>  So here.  What is in any self-respecting project?  The UFO flew in [s] and blew away a boring piece of text about the goal / objectives / plan / log / retrospective / improvement.  Let us proceed immediately to adjusting the project approach to our approach to the conference. <br><br>  So, declared in the title life hacking. <br><br><h2>  (1) Prepare </h2><br>  When we go to write code or test, or [enter your IT activity], we have at least some plan.  Right?  Not just a general idea that our product may create a cool atmosphere or be useful to someone else, but not to our customers (smart?).  We have a couple of specific tasks.  Let it be so with the conference. <br><br>  By default, the event will be reports and people.  Let's work with them. <br><br>  1a) <strong>Make a list of reports</strong> that you want to go the most. <br><br>  It will save much time and karma, than if you improvise, inventing a half-random route directly on the spot.  Thus, we minimize the number of reports to which we have arrived, and those by -. <br><br>  1b) <strong>Make a list of questions</strong> for each report. <br><br>  The question, or even better, the qualified answer to it, is a sure way to adapt the new information as comfortable as possible to the storage conditions in your head. <br><br>  Plus, as the Captain suggests, to ask questions on the subject of the report, not necessarily there, in the report, be present in person.  You can meet the speaker on the sidelines and accomplish on him what he craves most - spreading with passion. <br><br>  Thus, we increase the coverage of those reports with ourselves: for some, we go personally (and ask questions), learn about some from the speakers in a face-to-face conversation in the corridors (and ask questions). <br><br>  Why list?  As one famous Jedi says, the head is to think;  You can remember using other tools. <br><br>  1c) <strong>Make a list of people</strong> with whom to cross. <br><br>  People are the source of information about technologies (with which they worked), companies (in which they worked) and in general (with whatever they worked there). <br><br>  Think about what you use in your practice and what you could / would like to use.  Compare with the list of participants and speakers.  Intersect?  Fine!  Generating an artifact based on this intersection - we make a list of topics that would be useful or just interesting to discuss.  Why the list (‚ÄúI remember everything‚Äù)?  For the same as in the previous paragraph. <br><br>  Interests and people clearly do not overlap?  Then we head straight to the next life hack. <br><br><h2>  (2) Find like-minded people. </h2><br>  It just so happened that in some projects it is possible to achieve more decent results, if you are not doing business alone, but together with a group of interested people.  Especially if these people believe in the same things as you. <br><br>  Want to know more about that technology?  You're not the only one at the conference.  Want to learn about the benefits of this idea?  And again not one.  But how do you know who else is thinking about similar things? <br><br>  2a) <strong>Communicate</strong> .  With everyone you meet.  In the next chair in the hall with the reports, in the room between the reports, in the queue for sandwiches (preferably before lunch).  You never know where a useful idea can come from and who will bring it. <br><br>  2b) <strong>Share contacts</strong> .  Links to accounts in networks, numbers, email addresses.  Conferences are held, but people remain.  And with them, people, the easiest way to communicate when there is a channel for communication. <br><br>  2c) <strong>Tell the world about your ideas</strong> .  Send tweets with themed hashtags (‚ÄúWe‚Äôll start to do this on my project or I will take off my hat #continuousdelivery # of the conference name‚Äù), post to my friend (‚ÄúWe discussed it with the dudes at the Phalcon conference. I wondered‚Äù).  The more people will hear you, the more likely to meet like-minded people among them. <br><br>  This recipe works in the opposite direction.  Spying on stories and impressions online from other conference participants and within the bounds of decency to break into such stories with comments in a friendly way is also an opportunity to find like-minded people. <br><br>  And now my favorite item. <br><br><h2>  (3) to do </h2><br>  Preparation and communication with like-minded people - cool stuff.  But without another item, they will not give a complete combat kit, or even not shoot at all. <br><br>  In order to maximize profit, you need to do. <br><br>  Exchanged contacts with an interesting interlocutor?  Write to him.  Keep the conversation online (or even offline). <br><br>  An idea to try a new tool?  Write down this thought and try the tool.  The sooner, the better. <br><br>  The more time passes between the idea and the real attempt to implement it, the less if not chances for success, then at least the fuse.  Doing cool things on the enthusiasm that a proper conference charges is fun, drive and profit in its purest form. <br><br>  I‚Äôll put a semicolon on this life hacking. <br><br><h2>  Next step </h2><br>  Beware of correspondence curses from N. Taleb about "his own skin", I am going to personally carry the life hacks described above to the conference and put them to work there.  Just by the way, <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/2gis/blog/253375/">CodeFest 2015</a> is scheduled from day to day. <br><br>  There is a decisive intention to test the described tricks not only on their own experience, but also to pull the idea to the masses.  Take checklists with them, prepared by them in advance, hand them to different people somewhere closer to the beginning, and then collect them somewhere closer to the final.  Throw a life hack call from the barricade (2).  In general, in every possible way to evangelize, using all available means. <br><br>  About what came of it - I will tell you on occasion.  I'm going to check my list of tasks for the next event.  What and you want. <br><br>  Successful IT conferences! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/365267/">https://habr.com/ru/post/365267/</a></p>
