  <section class="page js-page"><h1>On the other side of the browser: How to connect accept payments</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Hello! <br><br>  Summer is hot and I don‚Äôt want to write about accounting at all.  Therefore, we decided to start a series of articles describing the work of our SAAS service from the inside.  We will write about both purely technical things (payment processing, security, technical support), and how we have grown from a promising start-up to a self-sustaining business - about money, about people, about the problems of any young business and how to overcome them.  If you are interested in something else - write in the comments or in a personal. <br><br><h4>  Payment processing </h4><br>  So, at some point you understand that you want to start accepting money from the user for your services and start thinking how you would do it better.  Below I will describe the systems with which we started working and on which we finally stopped.  Everything given in the article is only our experience, in no case is advertising and reflects only our opinion.  Perhaps, somewhere, we simply had no luck, but somewhere, on the contrary, luck contributed. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  Direct connection to Yandex Money </h4><br>  About a week soared brains in the end did not connect.  Initially, we looked for official excuses for refusing, then when all the requirements were met, they stupidly wrote that they did not want to work with new services until they reached a permanent profit.  Typical vicious circle - to connect the poison you need to have to turn on the poison.  Now, when we went to the necessary poison, I don‚Äôt see any reason to leave the aggregator.

    <h4>  Direct connection to Web Money </h4><br>  They think long enough, but they allow you to connect directly to services with any turnover.  We did not connect directly, because by the time WM had matured, they were already working with the aggregator and it was too lazy to change anything. <br><br><h4>  Aggregators </h4><br>  Here it is very important not to make a mistake with the choice.  We initially made a big mistake by choosing SpryPay as an aggregator.  There are a lot of aggregators that are similar to spriteas - all of them are characterized by the fact that depending on the payment method a different amount is taken from the user and payment is made through such an ass that even if the user is not ohrenel from changing the amount from the payment method, then he is surely fucked up by the process . <br><br>  With this aggregator there were 72% of failures (the user started the payment, but did not finish).  This is simply a catastrophic big figure. <br><br>  Most of these aggregators are their characteristics. <br><ul><li>  Different amount of payment depending on the method of payment </li><li>  Processing cards using LiqPay or similar services that require registration </li><li>  There are no clear data about the commissions on the site of the system, or rather they are, but they are either hidden or written so that it is impossible to understand anything. </li></ul><br>  It is better to work for free than to work with such an aggregator.  At that time, those support was simply torn apart due to constant problems and misunderstandings with payments. <br><br>  The only adequate aggregator that we managed to find and that works with start-up businesses was Robokassa ( <a href="http://www.robokassa.ru/">www.robokassa.ru</a> ).  There is a convenient payment on VISA / MASTERCARD cards, a single price for the buyer and a single commission (5%) regardless of the method of payment.  Money is transferred to your current account + you can request all documents.  In general, it is very good if it were not for the work of those support - the site has all the documentation, but if a question suddenly arises - then they answer very slowly.  One of our requests was answered in 5 days. <br><br><h4>  Accepting card payments </h4><br>  Sooner or later there is a question about the direct connection to the card processing.  The main advantage in comparison with aggregators is the ability to cancel any transaction on the card so that it returns to the buyer.  This is sometimes necessary when the client mistakenly paid a large amount, or connected to a more expensive tariff.  Well, the second plus is that the money immediately falls on the current account for each transaction, and not once a month as when working with an aggregator. <br><br>  Here you need to tune in to the fact that the process of direct connection of cards is very long with a lot of papers and takes an average of one month.  And they can refuse at any time. <br><br>  It is very important that the user can make payment without registering on the processing server - therefore, we immediately discard liqpay and oceanbank and in fact remain a rather small list.  <a href="http://assist.ru/">Assist.ru</a> refused immediately because of low revolutions at the start, <a href="http://chronopay.ru/">Chronopay.ru</a> refused three weeks after the start of the connection without even explaining what.  Relations with <a href="http://rbkmoney.ru/">RBC</a> were not at all for various reasons. <br><br>  We already wanted to spit on a direct connection to plastic, but the managers from <a href="http://payonline.ru/">Payonline.ru</a> contacted us.  And further communication with these guys was very pleasantly surprised. In my opinion, this is an example of how managers should work in the payment system. <br>  By the time we started the connection, we were so exhausted with this business that we ourselves slowed down with filling out the documents and grumbled very little by little.  So, the manager of Peyonline called us himself, helped by telephone with the paperwork, constantly kept in touch with how the process was going on their side, solved all the problems from the technical side - after talking with all the other processings, it was just heaven and earth.  There are a lot of formalities like everyone else, but firstly they work with the business at the start, secondly they help a lot with filling out this whole bundle of documents, thirdly they have very good technical support. <br><br><h4>  SMS </h4><br>  Here everything is decided by technical support and API for work.  In general, the conditions for SMS differ little.  We work with <a href="http://avisosms.ru/">www.avisosms.ru</a> and are completely satisfied.  At the connection stage, their support responded <b>on Sunday</b> 20 minutes after the request and didn‚Äôt just answer, but sent a ready written piece of code for integration.  After that, we loved them and did not even look aside :) Inside, everything is convenient and accessible.  API mine the strongest on the market.  I will not write about others, just because of the terrible work of those who support all those we have addressed. <br><br><h4>  Summary </h4><br><ul><li>  Start the process of connecting your service to payment at least one month before you plan to start accepting payment. </li><li>  Be sure to follow the failure of payments.  If the failure rate is above 15%, this is an indicator of the problem. </li><li>  Crappy processing can reduce your revenues by 2/3 </li><li>  Check that the payment amount for the user in all payment methods is no different. </li><li>  Be sure to make some real payments for your service for each payment method to make sure that there are no hidden registrations and payment will not be a problem for the user. </li><li>  Heat, damn it, zadolbala! </li></ul><br><br>  Successes! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/92202/">https://habr.com/ru/post/92202/</a></p>
