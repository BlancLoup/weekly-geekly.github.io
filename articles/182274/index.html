Despite the accusation that was sensational in the media at the time, no information was available on the Internet about what happened to those arrested further. <br><br>  Then I tried to contact one of the participants of the group, as their names, age and place of residence were indicated in the same indictment.  To my surprise, he very quickly answered in a very friendly tone, with emoticons, and asked what I would like to know. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  It turned out that it was not possible to get off with fines.  The investigation lasted a long time.  First, a trial of the "gang leader" was to be held.  But the years went on, the international search did not give success, and therefore the trial of the other participants was still appointed.  Specifically, the person with whom I spoke, was convicted recently, in 2011 - for 5 years conditionally.  As one would expect, it seems the court was unable to prove that the group received any profit from its activities, although it was one of the most famous teams on the scene.

      Of course, I immediately asked if he would agree to give an interview to the largest IT community in Russia.  I will collect questions from everyone, translate and send to him. <br><br>  Learning that this was a public interview, he said (and the words were chosen very carefully) that he would be happy to answer our questions, and this is not prohibited by law.  But according to the terms of his conviction, he is obliged to report to the authorities once a month, including whether he was not involved in criminal activities or whether he had to come into contact with persons currently involved in criminal activities. .  And since he would not want to complicate his position, it is better if I write to him after 2016. <br><br>  The hint is obvious.  In Russia, all pirates. <br><br>  I decided to google how serious the situation in the US is with those sentenced to a suspended sentence for copyright violations.  The prisontalk.com forum found several branches on this topic.  The main sections there are ‚Äúfor relatives‚Äù, ‚Äúfor criminals‚Äù.  Inside the latter are such sub-forums as ‚Äúfor those who are going to sit down,‚Äù ‚Äúfor former prisoners,‚Äù and others, including ‚Äúfor conditional‚Äù.  It turned out that pirates are observed under the same program as other easy crimes, and usually the conditions are not to have weapons and drugs at home, and of course not to commit new crimes and not to start questionable acquaintances. <br><br>  For example, one girl writes that her boyfriend, who has been serving a suspended sentence for domestic violence for 5 years (apparently beat her or his ex), was caught violating a copyright (probably downloading something).  And now he was sentenced to 9 months in prison.  She writes that this is not fair, because she thought that he would be put in prison only if he beat someone else, but not for copyright. <br><br>  The author of another topic, warned that tomorrow the officer who oversees him as a conditional conviction for copyright will make his first visit to his home, worried that he should undertake, since he had never violated anything before, had not even been fined for over speed.  He wondered if he should destroy all the alcohol that was in the house.  He was very nervous, cleaned the apartment all day, and even cleaned the carpets with shampoo. <br><br>  Approximately in such a situation is now the person with whom I spoke.  What do you think, is it worth trying to persuade him?  In the end, find a foreign colleague who would conduct an interview. <br><br>  The main thing that I would like to know from the results of this post is whether it would be interesting for the user to have such an interview with this person or another scener?  Are there any questions you would like to ask? <br><br>  <b>upd:</b> it was decided by the majority not to disturb the person.  But I think we will have other opportunities to talk with the sceners. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/182274/">https://habr.com/ru/post/182274/</a></p>
