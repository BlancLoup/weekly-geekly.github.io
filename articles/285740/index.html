If earlier you didn‚Äôt pay enough attention to the mobile promotion strategy, then it‚Äôs time to focus on <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259C%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B1%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BB%25D1%258C%25D0%25BD%25D1%258B%25D0%25B9_%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B0%25D1%2580%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B5%25D1%2582%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B3">this</a> area of ‚Äã‚Äãmarketing so that your target audience will not pass by you next time. <br><br><h4>  Use the right keywords </h4><br>  It may seem a bit old-fashioned, but proper use of keywords is just as important for mobile marketing as it is for content marketing.  The main difference is that customers are looking for something using mobile devices, most likely already in place.  Therefore, you must include location in keyword optimization.  Also, keep in mind that due to the small size of mobile devices, most users will type no more than three keywords.  Use a specialized keyword planner. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  For desktop systems, the first ten requests most often become the goal of promotion;  The consumer is lazy and does not want to scroll through the entire search page until he finds the one he needs.  Yes, and if your competitor is higher in the search, the buyer will probably go to him. <br><br><h4>  Do not forget the contact information </h4><br>  Having the correct contact information will simplify the usual search for buyers in your area.  Make contact information and map data easily accessible (how to get to, how to get to).  Do not forget to register your business in all local business catalogs and map services. <br>  Practice shows that many people are looking for products (services) through maps (Yandex, Google, 2gis).  So the registration of their company in them is far from a recommendation.

    <h4>  Contact customers </h4><br>  One of the advantages of mobile marketing is that it is much easier to contact target consumers compared to traditional search engine marketing. <br><br>  Make mobile marketing a priority in your overall strategy to get this advantage.  If you have new offers or products, make sure that they first appear in the mobile version of the site, because first of all customers will look there.  Make it possible for users to receive alerts on new offers. <br><br><h4>  Experiment with your site </h4><br>  Do not be afraid to move away from proven tools when it comes to the design of your mobile website.  If there is a place where you can feel freer, be more creative, then this is it. <br><br><h4>  Watch for compatibility </h4><br>  Make sure your mobile marketing materials and website are compatible with all mobile devices.  This is especially important when a new version of a popular device appears, such as, for example, another iPhone.  It is completely unacceptable to miss clients because of the banal incompatibility. <br><br><h4>  Use hyperlocalized marketing tools </h4><br>  Hyperlocalization is a powerful tool for improving mobile marketing.  Statistics show that most purchases occur within a radius of 10 kilometers from the client‚Äôs home.  Using <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/search/%3Fq%3D%255B%25D0%25B3%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BB%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B0%25D1%2586%25D0%25B8%25D1%258F%255D%26target_type%3Dposts" title="Habr√© articles on geolocation tag">IP geolocation</a> technology and big data analysis tools, marketers will be able to instantly get location data, allowing them to operate with highly targeted, personalized and relevant offers, such as discount coupons and point mobile banner ads, in real time.  Done correctly, these personalized ads are only welcomed by consumers, who take them for a true attempt to fully meet their needs. <br><br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperlocal" title="Hyperlocal">Hyper-</a> localized marketing ( <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperlocal" title="Hyperlocal">Hyper-Local Marketing</a> ) is a term used to describe precision marketing based on a specific geographic area or location.  Local marketing operates with values ‚Äã‚Äãof the oblast and city level, while hyperlocalized focuses on more specific geographic data within this region (city).  GPS, Glonass, WiFi and IMEI numbers are used to determine the location. <br><br><h4>  Mobile applications </h4><br>  Do not forget that modern mobile devices have many different functions, enhanced by the capabilities of applications.  For example, using a camera and an application, the device acquires the functions of a <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/QR-%25D0%25BA%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B4" title="What is the QR code?">QR</a> matrix scanner, with which it is possible to place additional information, etc.  If you creatively approach the application of this technology, you can significantly expand its applicability.  Although redundancy of use can only scare the customer. <br><blockquote>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/206924/" title="Criticism of the widespread use of QR code">What is wrong with QR codes?</a> </blockquote><br><h4>  Be ethical </h4><br>  Do not forget that the main goal of marketing is still to attract a customer.  Therefore, mobile marketing works only when it operates under legal conditions and offers recipients only relevant information and allows you to purchase the necessary goods and services on attractive terms. <br><br>  A mobile device is an intimate enough thing for the user, so that the thoughtless use of marketing opportunities will only scare the consumer away, and an illegal one can be <a href="http://www.rbcdaily.ru/world/562949979473251" title="In the US, a former marketer declared war on spam.">punished</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/285740/">https://habr.com/ru/post/285740/</a></p>
