  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Ctrl + DREAM (control sleep using gadgets)</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  I read quite a few articles on Habr√© on the topic ‚Äúgo to bed and get up on time and stay awake all day‚Äù, most of all I liked the article ‚Äú <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/arbeit/82641/">To sleep little, but rightly</a> ‚Äù. <br><br>  Since the topic is topical for me, I immediately wanted to find some kind of gadget that could wake me up in the ‚Äúright sleep phase‚Äù.  What is the sleep phase is written in the article at the link above. <br>  Googling found a few three options, each of which promised to wake me up just when I could do it without any extra effort and headache, and then all day feeling fine. <br><br>  Here they are: <a name="habracut"></a><br><h3>  Option 1: Sleeptracker </h3><br><img src="http://www.sleeptracker.com/images/SleeptrackerElite1.jpg" alt="image"><br>  Made in the form of watches that could be worn on the hand, if not for their appearance. <br>  The principle of the clock is simple, you set the time when you want to wake up, for example, at 7 o'clock, set the ‚Äútime window‚Äù "- 30 minutes. In the period from 6:30 to 7:00 the clock will determine when you have a fast sleep phase and wake you up. But even if during this time you don‚Äôt have this phase, they wake you up in no later than 7.00

      How do they determine when you have the "right phase" of sleep? <br>  At first, I thought that they measure the pulse, maybe body temperature and draw conclusions based on this data, but it turned out to be much easier, the clock has a built-in accelerometer that captures our movements. <br>  During the phase of deep sleep, we move a little, and during fast sleep, we turn, adjust the pillow, and by the intensity of our movement, we can determine what phase we are in. <br><br>  Price: 179 ye. <br><h6>  Pros: </h6><br>  - you can take with you and use not only at home <br>  - waterproof <br>  - accuracy of determining the phase of sleep 90% <br>  - there is a vibration mode if you want to get up without waking the rest <br><br><h6>  Minuses: </h6><br>  - ugly design, personally, I would not wear them every day <br>  - no self-study <br><br><h3>  Option 2: Axbo </h3><br><img src="http://www.axbo.com/axbo/CustomUpload/374O357O340O370O356O369O350O352O375O353O366O/4010_Shop_Peise_weckerplus_re.gif" alt="image"><br>  The principle of operation is the same as in the previous watch, but if the previous ones were wrist watches, then Axbo is a table clock. <br>  But how do they define movement? <br>  The motion sensor is inserted into the strap, which is worn on the hand and supports wireless communication with the clock. <br>  The basic model is designed for two people and is completed with two straps.  But the big drawback of this scheme is that the one who wakes up later will always lose, since he will have to wake up twice, for himself and for the one who used to be. <br><br>  Price: 360 ye for two persons, but a modelka for one for 179 ye already appeared on sale <br><h6>  Pros: </h6><br>  - nice design, ala "apple" <br>  - can work for two people at once <br>  - they learn by analyzing the intensity of your movements (in men, they are more intense during the fast phase), thereby increasing the accuracy of recognition. <br><br><h6>  Minuses: </h6><br>  - wake up two people at once <br>  - inconvenient to take on the road <br>  - no vibro mode <br><br><h3>  Option 3: Easywakeup </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/15f/594/297/15f594297cabb40d1e6bc88514072045.jpg" alt="image"><br>  Especially for those who already have an Iphone, because it is not a separate clock, but a program that works with an accelerometer built into the Iphone. <br><br>  Price: from 1 to 15 ye <br><h6>  Pros: </h6><br>  - price from 1 to 15 dollars <br>  - no need to buy additional accessories <br><br><h6>  Minuses: </h6><br>  - only for iphone owners <br>  - if you are very heavy and in a dream waving your hands a lot there is a chance to break your beloved Iphone, because you need to put it next to it. <br><br><h3>  Option 4: Smart Alarm Clock </h3><br>  Everything is true for this alarm as for the previous one, except that this softphone is made for the Android platform and so far it is distributed for free. <br><br><h3>  Option 5: HappyWakeUp </h3><br>  Also a pure software solution for Nokia and Iphone.  There is a fundamental difference from previous programs, in that this does not require an accelerometer in the phone / smartphone, but tries to determine your sleep phase by sounds. <br>  Not sure how this is possible :) <br><br>  PS I don‚Äôt specifically provide links to websites, you can easily find them, there is a lot of laudatory information there, but after talking with friends I found out, some actually use such things and they really help.  Of course not always accurately determine the time of awakening, but in most cases correct. <br>  A little later I want to check the effect of such devices on myself. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/84799/">https://habr.com/ru/post/84799/</a></p>
