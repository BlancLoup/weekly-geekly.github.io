I spent the new year in the city of Zurich, where I talked with several employees of the Evil Corporation, and walked around their office. <br><br>  In my post I will try to describe more of the social features of working at Google in Switzerland, but I cannot hide the interior of your office from you, it is gorgeous :) <br><br>  All information received from employees of the company in words, so perhaps something may not be accurate or not at all correspond to reality.

      So, in Zurich is the central office of Google in Europe. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/486/566/f2a/486566f2a6fd31094c3406dc4de7d954.jpg"><br><br>  It employs about 1,500 employees, of which about 60 are Russian speakers.  Hunt them both from other offices (for example, many people move from the Moscow office of Google), and directly. <br><br>  UPD.  My numerous requests in the comments made a separate topic for questions regarding work in the Google office in Zurich: <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/google/138980/">habrahabr.ru/blogs/google/138980</a> <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  In Zurich, the locals speak Swiss (which is very similar to German), but Google all speak English. <br><br>  When moving Google pays employee: <br>  ‚Ä¢ renting an apartment for 1 month: you should not be soared about what and where to rent.  Start to settle, and then, if you don‚Äôt like this apartment, you will find something more interesting for yourself.  After receiving the first wage, if you please, pay yourself. <br>  ‚Ä¢ car rental for 2 weeks - What would you be convenient to buy all the necessary household items and furniture, as well as see the surroundings. <br>  ‚Ä¢ Courses in Swiss, German and English (optional) <br>  ‚Ä¢ Fitness and various sports activities. <br>  ‚Ä¢ Internet in a new apartment, so that you can work from home. <br><br>  If I understand correctly, when transferring from another Google office, points 1 and 2 are not implemented. <br><br>  About wages - it is classified information, and I was asked not to disclose it.  But, if we compare it with the Moscow office of Google, the salary in Zurich is approximately 1.5‚Äì1.8 times higher. <br>  The cost of living in Zurich is also 1.5-2 times higher than in Moscow.  For example, renting a 1-room studio not in the historical center will cost about 50-60 thousand rubles. <br>  Food in supermarkets is slightly more expensive than Moscow, in restaurants more expensive than 2 times. <br>  Travel by public transport is more expensive, but it is well organized. <br><br>  As in all countries, the concept of google offices is a focus on comfort and autonomy.  Employees do not need to go to cafes / restaurants - there is an excellent dining room and a huge variety of coffee areas.  All food and drinks are free. <br><br>  A typical day for a company employee in Zurich is as follows: ascent, small fees, walk to the office (Zurich is a small city itself, so you can walk from any district. In extreme cases, by bicycle).  Breakfast in the office, work, lunch in the office, work, dinner in the office. <br><br>  Now about the interior. <br><br>  Canteen: <br><br>  There is a great machine that makes orange juice fresh on you: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/d3b/9f7/bd0/d3b9f7bd072c044372a8ee890594a27d.jpg"><br><br>  You can choose from European food (schnitzel, fried potatoes), or Japanese <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/f9e/6c6/792/f9e6c679201bb13259a8d150c96c63ae.jpg"><br><br>  For dessert, for tea, you can take cakes or croissants ... <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/95c/4ec/d5d/95c4ecd5d2af84659bfc6109ebdf4a75.jpg"><br><br>  On each floor there are 2-3 kitchens where you can drink tea or coffee, eat snacks or cookies and talk with colleagues about work. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/d02/943/a9f/d02943a9ff73feac64b5ea528a32e526.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/cc6/6b2/52c/cc66b252c5d174490dc82aae5b7d61f3.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/4e2/f08/986/4e2f08986147704769bb805a306e82c9.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/6b1/d3b/8bb/6b1d3b8bbdb71c10eda6ab9d851f799a.jpg"><br><br>  Presentation room.  In the evenings, it is used as a cinema. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/9e4/4e8/220/9e44e82209fea21af0bab8996de780f4.jpg"><br><br>  There are local meeting rooms that are designed either for meetings with a small number of people, or for telephone conversations. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/a00/d11/e6b/a00d11e6b9c7496e3e9f9d10dc160c06.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/d0f/bc3/fca/d0fbc3fca38571a421ffdee9dff8298c.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/53c/25f/f3f/53c25ff3fd8d1ed6a2a22d0305bb0f83.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/d5a/7b6/9b5/d5a7b69b51050bad6094ccb17d2e975c.jpg"><br><br>  If suddenly the employee is tired - you can always lie down and sleep in the recreation area.  It is not recommended to photograph her (the corresponding announcement hangs), so as not to interfere with the rest for the rest. <br><br>  If you suddenly become bored, you can always go to the game room and play with your colleagues.  In addition to the games themselves, there is an equipped stage on which musical groups perform. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/f1a/638/bea/f1a638bea1e3b5659d37527080f300d9.jpg"><br><br>  I also didn‚Äôt recommend taking photographs, as there may be pieces of a service code on the screens that will enslave the world in the future. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/32c/b7f/db2/32cb7fdb2818394ee741db38ce017e03.jpg"><br><br>  But in general, there is nothing special to photograph there - jobs are quite ordinary.  Spacious, each 1-2 large monitor.  As a rule, they are connected to system units or MacBook Air. <br><br>  If you suddenly get tired of sitting in your place and you want to change the situation - you can always transfer to a special room and work separately from your team on your project. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/be4/479/842/be447984281327277a7173600d08a831.jpg"><br><br>  Also in the office there is a library, decorated in a classic style.  It's nice to sit in such a situation and discuss start-ups. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/5e4/298/5d6/5e42985d6752ec79986cd51463d59e40.jpg"><br><br>  The impression from the building is not the office, but the club.  Some employees go with children, some with dogs.  All chasing teas and talking about life in the kitchens ... The work process is not felt at all. <br><br>  This is probably the most employee-oriented office I've ever seen in my life. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/138694/">https://habr.com/ru/post/138694/</a></p>
