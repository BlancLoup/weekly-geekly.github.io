Of course, control is needed, because there is no way to prevent it.  China is less scrupulous to the opinion of society, they evaluated the threat and limited the Internet.  Now they have no such problems, ‚ÄùKlimenko said at the lecture‚Äú Information Security of Russia ‚Äù, held in the framework of the course‚Äú Army and Society, ‚ÄùInterfax reports. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Klimenko expressed dissatisfaction with the low level of communication between foreign companies and Russian law enforcement agencies.

      ‚ÄúWe are in a strange position when there is a foreign company in the territory of the Russian Federation, it makes money, nevertheless, it does not respond to a single request from law enforcement agencies.  Unfortunately, we cannot write to the What's app and ask to disable encryption, ‚Äùhe said. <br><br>  An immediate reaction followed the words of Klimenko both in the media and among other, more scrupulous in choosing the words of the officials.  So, Internet ombudsman Dmitry Marinichev called the Chinese model of restriction a ‚Äúcatastrophe‚Äù. <br><br>  ‚ÄúThis is some kind of catastrophe.  First, I am a categorical adversary ( <i>Internet restrictions, approx</i> ).  Secondly, to fight with technologies in this way is, of course, about nothing.  This is a counter-trend that will not lead to any decision, but vice versa.  Because in this case, it will be necessary to start fighting with its citizens, ‚Äùsaid Marinichev. <br><br>  Marinichev points out that at the current level of Internet development in Russia, it is impossible to implement the Chinese model.  The ombudsman also believes that the concept of ‚Äúinformation security‚Äù can be used to put in any convenient meaning, which is extremely dangerous. <br><br>  ‚ÄúAnd what knowledge is dangerous?  For example, the knowledge that man descended from a monkey is dangerous knowledge for the citizens of our country?  And imagine that someone decides for you that it is dangerous.  What does this mean?  The fact that we are actually moving to the zone of dogmas and definitions, and this is not true, this does not lead to technological development.  It conserves and makes thinking backward.  So how can you speak for it?  It is impossible in any way, ‚Äùadded Marinichev. <br><br>  Almost immediately, the chairman of the Human Rights Council under the President of the Russian Federation, Mikhail Fedotov, responded to the scandalous statement of Klimenko.  He made a very accurate and accessible analogy between the World Ocean and the Internet: <br><br>  ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not sure that Internet security in the Chinese version will be effective.  The Internet is the ocean.  It is pointless to build dams in the ocean, ships, drilling platforms, artificial islands need to be built in the ocean, and building fences there is an empty matter and it is completely unpromising, ‚Äùsaid Fedotov. <br><br>  According to the counselor, it is necessary to solve the problems arising from the use of the network within society, and not through access restriction. <br><br>  ‚ÄúWe can even disconnect our country from the Internet, but it hardly makes sense.  Then others will live in the era of Zuckerberg, and we will return to the era of <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2593%25D1%2583%25D1%2582%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B1%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580%25D0%25B3,_%25D0%2598%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B3%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BD">Gutenberg</a> (the <i>German pioneer printer, it is believed that it was from his activities that the mass printing of books and other printed products came into use, note</i> ).  I will give an analogy with the human body.  A person is constantly being attacked by viruses, bacteria, other microorganisms, but the person does not walk in a spacesuit.  For protection there are internal mechanisms, immunity.  So we need to develop immunity in society against any Internet contagion, ‚Äùexplained Fedotov. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/356102/">https://habr.com/ru/post/356102/</a></p>
