  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Murat Urtembaev - the first Soviet hacker</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The first Soviet hacker was a graduate of Moscow State University Murat Urtembayev.  In 1983 he hacked the AvtoVAZ software system, as a result of which the work of the conveyor stopped for three days.  And this is one of the first "cyber attacks" in the USSR, which was discovered. <br><br>  The young specialist was predicted to have brilliant prospects in mathematics, but he did not go to science and by distribution got to AvtoVAZ.  In the Office of the automatic system for the supply of mechanical components to the conveyor worked programmers involved in software and ordinary technicians who serviced the system and had no relation to the software. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/7ad/702/f64/7ad702f64d7548e29805d3b20ef21c53.png">

    <a name="habracut"></a>  The work was carried out according to the following scheme: if necessary, the programmer could make changes to the software, without writing about his actions in writing.  That is, it was possible to change the system and go unnoticed. <br><br>  This was also used by the programmer Urtembaev, who is engaged in the maintenance of computers.  Using a regular floppy (pre-tested), he made his edits to the program that controls the delivery of parts to the conveyor.  In fact, Urtembayev developed a patch for the main counter program, which measures the feed cycles of the nodes on the conveyor line.  As a result, the counter rhythm was lost and the specified part entered the conveyor with a delay.  Given that the process was calculated to seconds, the delay was simply unacceptable. <br><br>  According to Murat‚Äôs plan, the ‚Äúvirus‚Äù was supposed to start at a certain hour.  And to protect himself, the programmer took care of the alibi - he appointed the start of the patch on the day of his exit from vacation.  By calculation, Urtembaeva had to go to work, detect a failure and eliminate it, heroically saving the conveyor.  But the plan failed, as the program started up independently a few days earlier ... <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/784/a85/afe/784a85afefc246eda856dad286f6d5b2.jpg"><br><br>  When the patch is self-activated, the automatics seem to be mad.  Parts continued to regularly arrive on the conveyor, but only at the wrong time and not those that were required.  The production cycle got off track, nobody understood anything, there was real mechanical and logical chaos around.  As a result of thorough verification by the best specialists of all computer equipment, no technical faults were found.  But found a faulty piece of code.  Restarting the work program did not help, failures continued.  It took about three days to normalize the workflow.  Failure in the system caused serious material damage to the enterprise, since hundreds of cars did not get off the assembly line. <br><br>  Murat himself confessed to the crime.  After checking and investigating the incident, it turned out that he was not the only one hacking the system.  There were other programmers who deliberately created failures on the pipeline, after which they themselves eliminated them, receiving for this bonuses, rewards and surcharges. <br><br>  The case went to court.  But with the punishment there was a collapse.  Under the law, the committed action did not fall under the category of crime and did not provide for criminal punishment.  Therefore, the first hacker was convicted of hooliganism and was given a year and a half conditionally with a written undertaking not to leave the place.  Of course, Urtenbaev was dismissed from his post as a programmer, but was obliged to compensate for the damage caused.  He worked out his punishment as a locksmith on the main assembly line. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/916/306/388/9163063880d24307b2908f35fb9bd727.jpg"><br><br>  The incident has become known to the entire Union and has caused many disputes at the expense of the act of Urtenbayev.  The newspapers wrote that the system programmer at the Volzhsky Automobile Plant modified the software for the automated process control system of the main conveyor, as a result of which the work was stopped for three days.  Two hundred cars did not leave the assembly line of VAZ while the programmers were looking for the source of failures.  The damage amounted to millions of rubles. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/277487/">https://habr.com/ru/post/277487/</a></p>
