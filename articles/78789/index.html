Your editorial staff are absolutely any people - from schoolchildren to academicians (and there are 10,000 per person without a higher education per academician).  Moreover, it is impossible to find out who is an academician, and who is a schoolboy.  An academician may turn out to be a mechanic, a schoolchild calmly communicate and edit articles on thermodynamics as part of a technical college course, a mechanic can write articles about favorite helicopters from all countries of the world, as if he personally participated in assembling each of them. <br>  And here's the problem - you notice that the following articles appear in your encyclopedia (the list is current): <br><ul><li>  <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259E%25D0%25BF%25D0%25BF%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BB%25D1%258C%25D0%25BD-%25D0%2591%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BA%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2%25D1%2581%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B9,_%25D0%2593%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BD_%25D1%2584%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BD">Oppeln-Bronikovsky, Hermann von</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2594%25D0%2592%25D0%2593%25D0%259C%25D0%25A3">DVMU</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2593%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B7%25D0%25B0_(%25D0%2592%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BB%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BD-5)">Eyes (Babylon 5)</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A2%25D1%2580%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B4%25D1%2586%25D0%25B0%25D1%2582%25D1%258B%25D0%25B9">Thirtieth</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259F%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D1%2584%25D0%25B5%25D1%2581%25D1%2581%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B3%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B0_%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B2%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B0%25D1%2582">Professiograma lawyer</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259F%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D1%2584%25D0%25B5%25D1%2581%25D1%2581%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B3%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BC%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B0_%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B2%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B0%25D1%2582%25D0%25B0">Lawyer's professiogram</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A6%25D0%25B8%25D1%2584%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2%25D1%258B%25D0%25B5_%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B2%25D1%2582%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B0%25D1%2582%25D1%258B">Digital machines</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/LongGong">Longgong</a> </li></ul><br>  (this is in 15 minutes. upd .: this was a list of articles created in 15 minutes by unregistered users, or by users without an automated flag (= most often - freshly registered)) <br><br>  Now the challenge.  How to separate the wheat from the chaff?  How to choose what should remain in your <i>encyclopedia</i> , claiming to be a <i>quality one</i> , and what should be thrown out or transferred to other projects?  What focus the work of editors, administrators, <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  Possible selection criteria </h4><br>  Selection criteria can be many.  For example: <br><ol><li>  The object of the article should please the author of the article (= no criteria, take everything) </li><li>  The object of the article should please the moderator (as the left heel wants, aka "administrative arbitrariness") </li><li>  The number of pages about the object of the article in Google / Yandex should be more than 1000 (‚ÄúGoogle-test‚Äù) </li><li>  About the object of the article should be reviews on forums and blogs </li><li>  About the object of the article should be reviews in independent journals and publications </li><li>  The object of the article should be a scientific publication. </li><li>  About the object of the article should be a scientific publication with a citation index of at least 5. </li><li>  On the object of the article should be published monograph of Doctor of Sciences, which is available in the state library </li></ol><br>  As you can see, there are many possible criteria.  But which one to choose for your encyclopedia?  You need to set the conditions: <br><ul><li>  They should not be tied to the subjective assessment of a particular person - it‚Äôs not convenient for you to sit in the editorial office for 24 hours, and articles appear and appear </li><li>  Most editors should agree with them. </li><li>  The criterion, if possible, should be such that most editors can test it. </li><li>  They must meet your goals. </li></ul><br><h4>  The solution to this problem in Wikipedia </h4><br>  Wikipedia is governed by the following rules, which are called <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2592%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BF%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B8%25D1%258F:5%25D0%25A1">5 pillars</a> : <br><ol><li>  Wikipedia is an encyclopedia (and not a dump of information) </li><li>  Wikipedia is neutral </li><li>  Wikipedia materials are free to use. </li><li>  Wikipedia has a code of conduct </li><li>  Wikipedia has no strict rules. </li></ol><br>  To select the desired criterion, we take the first, second and fourth pillars.  This is quite enough: <br><ul><li>  "Should like the author" - does not satisfy the first pillar </li><li>  "Should like moderator" - does not satisfy the fourth pillar </li><li>  "Google test", "reviews on forums and blogs" - does not satisfy the second pillar.  There may be many publications, but if they are all written by one person, then the presentation of the material will not be neutral.  Plus, not everything that is written on the forums (= fences) should be significant for the encyclopedia (first stop). </li></ul><br>  Thus, there are options: <br><ul><li>  About the object of the article should be reviews in independent journals and publications </li><li>  The object of the article should be a scientific publication. </li><li>  About the object of the article should be a scientific publication with a citation index of at least 5. </li><li>  On the object of the article should be published monograph of Doctor of Sciences, which is available in the state library </li></ul><br>  They are sorted in ascending order of "hardness".  So, in Wikipedia adopted the softest version of all valid.  <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2592%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BF%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B8%25D1%258F:%25D0%259A%25D0%2597">Namely</a> :

      <b>The subject or topic is supposedly significant if they are covered in sufficient detail in independent authoritative sources.</b> <br><br>  Authoritative, most often, means sources that have an author (to check for neutrality and authority) and, often, an editor, for example, a publishing editor of a popular or scientific journal.  Or even an online newspaper, but anyway - there is an author and editor. <br><br><h4>  Exceptions and clarifications </h4><br>  Unfortunately, this rule is somewhere too hard, somewhere too incomprehensible.  For example, is it worth using the Lebedev blog as a proof of the significance of the topic of road signs design?  And the interview, for example, of the academician of the RAS about the fact that we have 4 different Ivan the Terrible?
