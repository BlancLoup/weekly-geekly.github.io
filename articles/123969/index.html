  <section class="page js-page"><h1>PlayStation Plus: an additional service category must have</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Starting from the 4th generation of consoles, the manufacturers of the main gaming platforms seriously competed with each other, trying to attract the consumer not only with exclusive games, but with original additional features, the importance of which, at times, was difficult to overestimate.  For example, the strength of the PlayStation consoles of all three generations was the use of media of the most technologically advanced format of their time: CD, DVD or Blue-Ray, which allowed users to significantly save on the purchase of the corresponding player and use the console as a media center.  Note that in the technological aspect of the advantage of the PlayStation is still undeniable.  This is felt not only when watching a video in the Blue-Ray format on the console, but also when using the console for its intended purpose: while the xbox 360 owners have to change as many as 3 DVDs during, say, LA Noir, the PlayStation followers are spared from such inconvenience.  Favorable features of Sony in terms of console architecture, its greater potential and convenience for game developers will be one of the following topics on our blog, and today we will talk in detail about the PS3 network service - PlayStation Plus and its advantages over its main competitors. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/2e2/dde/9eb/2e2dde9eb2e8e775be7d353929c6ddf0.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  At the dawn of the 7th generation era, the console services of both mainstream consoles ‚Äî the PlayStation Network and Xbox Live ‚Äî were only a pale shadow of what they are now, although their main function is to enable online gaming, they performed regularly.  However, already in this aspect, Sony and Microsoft are distinguished diametrically in approaches to monetizing the service: Microsoft, in fact, did not leave any choice to the players, voluntarily-compulsively ‚Äúurging‚Äù to buy a Gold subscription, which gives a pass to the multiplayer.  And people were forced to shell out: in spite of how widely advertised additional ‚Äúbuns‚Äù Live were tasty, for most players they were always just a free application to the opportunity to kick a couple of overseas enemy asses with a friend on the net.  For Sony, the free network mode has always been a sacred concept, and even the most fierce Japanese marketer would never have thought of charging for what is rightfully owned by users.  Gamers gratefully accepted the position of the company, and the free PlayStation multiplayer for many of them became the main argument in choosing the console. <br><br>  However, as time went on, the number of users for whom the network service was only a means of accessing online was steadily decreasing every year.  Players have become more demanding of the range of services provided and this has forced the consoles market giants to continue the battle for the consumer on a new front.  Sony made a strategic decision - to divide its service into 2 parts: PlayStaion Network continued to work in the old mode, retaining its main distinguishing feature - free multiplayer, and the new paid network service PlayStation Plus in addition to the full functionality of PS Network now offers its users access to content , which competitors have no analogues.

      1. Testing full games.  The opportunity to get acquainted with a full-fledged game before its direct purchase is difficult to overestimate.  This is not a polished demo, which gives a very weak idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe plot and gameplay.  A vivid example is the game Dragon Age II.  Most gamers (in particular, fans of Dragon Age: Origins), who played the sequel demo, put a disappointing diagnosis on Bioware's brainchild - KG and flatly refused to buy the second part.  And only a few of those who nevertheless decided to buy, were surprised to find that they were in a hurry with the conclusions, trusting in an amusingly tailored and fairly crumpled demo. <br><br>  As a rule, one hour is enough to get a complete picture of the product.  At the same time, all the progress and trophies obtained during the trial play are taken into account when launching a full-fledged game, which saves at least an hour of time and eliminates the repetition routine. <br><br>  2. Free games.  During the entire subscription validity period, users get free access to four full versions of PS3 games, PlayStation Network arcades, and retro hits PS 1 and PS 2. Anticipating possible objections from skeptics from the series ‚ÄúWell, what can a normal person give for free! .. ‚Äùor‚Äú Well, yes, one game from the list will be normal, and the rest will be thrash! ‚Äù, We answer: the games in the shortlist of each month will appear not at all trash, but having an average rating in the world gaming media not less than 7 points from 10, and this, you see, is an indicator. <br><br>  3. Online storage.  With the help of XMB (XrossMediaBar) service, users can save their games and resume them from the point at which the game was interrupted.  Access to the saved games will be available from any PS3 console when logging in to the PlayStation Network under your account.  Thus, the risk of data loss when replacing the console ‚Äúfirmware‚Äù is completely eliminated.  This is a blow below the belt for Xbox 360 adepts, who are constantly faced with problems when transferring content from console to console, replacing HD or limited saves when playing on a version with a small hard disk drive.  Network storage of game progress completely insures the user against losing it when the console is lost. <br><br>  4. Discounts.  PlayStation Plus customers are offered exclusive discounts on PS3 and PSP (PlayStation Portable) games.  The list of games at special prices in the online store PlayStation Store will be updated monthly.  And again, the discount shortlist will not fall into thrash.  Perhaps not the exclusives, the release of which took place a week ago, but quite a good AAA six months ago. <br><br>  5. Special content.  Avatars and custom themes, many of which are exclusive, will be available to users of the PlayStation Plus service, also completely free for the entire subscription period.  The importance of this innovation is somewhat dimming compared to the main four, but do not underestimate the number and role of users who live in the PS Network active virtual avatar life.  For many of them, this is truly an event. <br><br>  6. Demos.  Subscribers get the right before other users to get acquainted with the beta and demo versions of games, as well as see the promotional videos before their official publication.  If the opportunity to play a demo or watch a promo video of an upcoming blockbuster is anyway present on Xbox live, then the possibility of early beta access for subscribers to the service (and not the buyers of one of the previous games of the developer) is an absolute exclusive PlayStation Plus. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/299/956/e19/299956e19d7530169065dc609da7b7d6.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Here is such a new service from Playstation.  Must have?  Must have!  Moreover, the price for it does not bite at all: only 80 dead raccoons per year.  Strongly recommended to all users of PS 3, who live a full virtual life, and does not go online from time to time. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/123969/">https://habr.com/ru/post/123969/</a></p>
