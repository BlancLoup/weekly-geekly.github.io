      If you don‚Äôt devote even a little time to this moment, your time will get lost in the vacuum of your more and more crowded life.  You will understand this when you find yourself already tired, withered old man and you will ask yourself more than once: ‚ÄúI wonder, where did my time go?‚Äù <br><br>  Professor Harold Hill said: <br><blockquote>  ‚ÄúYou constantly save up‚Äú tomorrow, ‚Äùand find that you are left with nothing today, because too many empty days were‚Äú yesterday ‚Äù.‚Äù </blockquote><br>  This article challenges you to finally <em>rethink the rhythm of your life</em> , in order to bring you back to the simple truths of our being. <br><br>  Unfortunately, for most people, life to the brim is filled with "non-existent" problems, which he constantly decides that ultimately has no worthwhile value. <br><br>  All these people are in survival mode.  Are you in survival mode? <br><br>  Like Bilbo, most of us are a small piece of butter that they try to spread over a large piece of bread.  And then, the bread is not ours, but someone else's.  Few take fate into their own hands. <br><br>  <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259F%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BA%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B5_Y">Generation Y is</a> well aware of what it is about, because it was the only worldview that we were taught to live by someone else‚Äôs rules. <br><br>  Nevertheless, the younger generation thinks, <i>working at 110%</i> and having an infinite number of intentions, <strong>it is possible</strong> to live every moment on its own rules. <br><br>  <strong>You are the creator of your destiny.</strong> <br><br>  You are responsible for what surrounds you. <br><br>  You are decisive.  You have to decide everything yourself, because if you do not make decisions, then someone else will take it for you. <br><br>  With this everyday morning routine, let's quickly change your life. <br><br>  This may seem like a big list, but in fact it‚Äôs pretty simple stuff: <br><ul><li>  Get enough sleep </li><li>  Enter "your zone" </li><li>  Make your body move </li><li>  Eat right </li><li>  be ready </li><li>  Be inspired </li><li>  Keep a plan for the future in your head </li><li>  Do something that will move you closer to your dream. </li></ul><br>  Let's start: <br><br><h2>  Healthy sleep is at least 7 hours </h2><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/bfb/1b0/b6a/bfb1b0b6a0c84fbdbb733461ad3f849b.jpg"><br><br>  Let's face it;  sleep is also important as nutrition and water intake. <br><br>  Despite this, millions of people do not sleep in sufficient quantities, and therefore experience various problems. <br><br>  The National Sleep Foundation (NSF) conducted surveys that showed that over <strong>40 million Americans suffer from almost 70 different sleep disorders</strong> .  But that's not all, <strong>60% of adults</strong> and <strong>69% of children</strong> experience one or more problems with sleep during the week. <br><br>  In addition, more than <strong>40% of adults</strong> experience daytime sleepiness, which seriously interferes with daily activities for more than a few days every month, and <strong>20% of them experience drowsiness for several days</strong> a week or more. <br><br>  Healthy sleep, on the contrary, contributes to the following things: <br><ul><li>  Increases memory performance </li><li>  Your life extends </li><li>  Irritability decreases </li><li>  Increasing creativity </li><li>  Focuses attention </li><li>  Reduced weight and increased muscle mass from training </li><li>  Stress decreases </li><li>  Decreases dependence on energy stimulants, such as coffee. </li><li>  Reduces the risk of getting into an accident </li><li>  Reduced risk of depression </li><li>  And much more‚Ä¶ </li></ul><br>  Continuing to read the article is <strong>pointless</strong> unless you put sleep into priorities.  <em>Why do you need it if you get up at 5 am, taking only 3 hours to sleep?</em> <br><br>  So you will not last long. <br><br>  You can resort to stimulants to compensate for this.  But with this in the present, <strong>in the future, your health can be seriously compromised</strong> .  Long-term stability is necessary to achieve a big goal. <br><br><h2>  Prayer and meditation contribute to your clarity and abundance. </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/603/f4a/856/603f4a85676341b0837d3d640b3b2bef.jpg"><br><br>  After you have received a sound amount of sleep, <em>prayer and meditation will be crucial for your attitude</em> to positive thinking.  What you focus on is what you get. <br><br>  Prayer and meditation contribute to the development of <em>genuine gratitude</em> for all that you have.  Gratitude affects the versatility of thinking.  When you think multifaceted - the whole world, in full view.  <em>Your possibilities are endless.</em> <br><br>  People are like magnets.  When you are grateful for all that you have, you will attract more positive and good.  Gratitude is contagious. <br><br>  Gratitude can be the main key to success.  No wonder they call her the " <strong>mother</strong> " of all virtues. <br><br>  If you begin your morning plunging into a space of gratitude and clarity, you attract the best that the world can offer you, just don't get distracted. <br><br><h2>  Persistent physical training </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/48c/6a5/f92/48c6a5f923db4586b2eadc2ca2d2bcab.jpg"><br><br>  According to the <i>US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</i> , despite the infinite amount of evidence on the benefits of physical education, <strong>only one-third of Americans between the ages of 25 and 64</strong> practice physical exercise regularly. <br><br>  If you want to stand in the same ranks with healthy, happy, productive people all over the world - get into the habit of exercising regularly.  Many people now go to sports halls, forcing their body to move.  Recently, I have noticed that, by ennobling my yard in the wee hours, an intense influx of inspiration and clarity comes to me. <br><blockquote>  Regardless of your preferences - make your body move. </blockquote><br>  Physical exercises have an impact in <em>reducing the chance of depression, anxiety, stress</em> .  Physical activity also influences a lot of success in your career. <br><br>  If you do not care about your body, then any other aspect of your life will suffer.  <strong>People are holistic creatures</strong> . <br><br><h2>  Consume 30 grams of protein </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/3b4/44f/a73/3b444fa739434325a50e93379c9b5227.jpg"><br><br>  Donald Lyman, an honorary professor of nutrition at the University of Illinois, recommends eating at least 30 grams of protein for breakfast.  In turn, Timothy Ferriss, the author of the book ‚ÄúThe Body in 4 hours,‚Äù also recommends eating 30 grams of protein within 30 minutes after waking up. <br><br>  According to Timothy, his father did it and lost <strong>over 8.5 pounds in a month</strong> in weight <strong>.</strong> <br><br>  Foods enriched with protein retain a feeling of satiety longer than all the others, because they are digested longer.  And also, proteins support the level of sugar in the blood, which is necessary for containing spikes of hunger. <br><br>  Eating protein firstly reduces the ‚Äúthirst‚Äù of white carbohydrates.  White carbohydrates are a type of carbohydrate that <em>is deposited in fat</em> .  Remember donuts, toasts, and donuts. <br><br>  Timothy, gives 4 tips for eating protein per morning: <br><ul><li>  Spend at least 40% of your breakfast on protein </li><li>  Do this with 2-3 eggs (each of which approximately contains 6 grams of protein) </li><li>  If you do not like eggs, eat something like Turkish bacon, organic bacon or sausage, or homemade cheese </li><li>  Or you can always mix synthetic protein with water. </li></ul><br>  For people who do not consume dairy products, meat and eggs, there is an excellent alternative - products of plant origin.  Legumes, greens, nuts and seeds are all rich in protein. <br><br><h2>  Take a cold shower </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a7b/14a/9a3/a7b14a9a3c7e4643a0cd47958f9bb4c7.jpg"><br><br>  Anthony Robbins begins his morning by jumping into a <em>13-degree</em> pool. <br><br>  Why does he need it? <br><br>  Immersion in cold water dramatically contributes to the <em>physical and psychological attitude</em> .  By practicing this exercise regularly, a person ensures long-term <em>changes in his immune, lymphatic, circulatory and digestive systems of the body</em> , which in turn improve our quality of life.  This exercise also contributes to the process of weight loss, because it increases your metabolism. <br><br>  Studies in 2007 showed that <strong>cold showers contribute to a better way to treat depression</strong> than medication.  This is due to the fact that cold water irritates receptors, causing a wave of chemical reactions of neurochemical substances that make you feel happy. <br><br>  Of course, first there is the fear of taking a cold shower.  No doubt, if you have ever tried, you will find yourself at a distance by being a person, afraid to even think about entering the booth. <br><br>  You can say to yourself: " <em>Come on tomorrow, old man,</em> " turning the hot water lamb. <br><br>  Or maybe quickly jump into the icy water and the rhinestone will translate it into hot. <br><br>  What helps me to think of it as a cold water pool.  It is slow agonizing <del>  death </del>  that sneaks up on you <em>while you hesitate to enter it</em> .  You just need not to go and jump into the pool.  After <strong>20 seconds</strong> - you are already arriving in perfect order. <br><br>  Similarly with a cold shower.  At first, your heart beats in a crazy rhythm, but after 20 seconds it's all right. <br><br>  For me, this activity raises willpower, <strong>raises the level of my inspiration and increases creativity</strong> .  Standing under cold water, I train slow, measured breathing to restore restraint and calm.  After I cool down I feel endlessly happy and inspired.  Many ideas start to visit me and this has become my way of being motivated to achieve my goals. <br><br>  Plus the fact that this morning <em>freak is</em> <strong>very healthy</strong> .  Do this and you will feel alive;  set the tone, leaving the comfort zone surrounding you! <br><br><h2>  Listen / Read educational books </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/6d7/a76/14b/6d7a7614b668456c9feb82829d781aa5.jpg"><br><br>  Most people prefer <em>entertaining</em> literature, but <strong>extraordinary individuals consciously choose learning and educational materials</strong> .  For most successful people all over the world, <em>reading at least one book per week</em> is considered normal.  These people do not stop the learning process. <br><br>  For example, I can safely listen to one audiobook per week, devoting very little time to this activity: while I get to the institute, and walking around campus. <br><br>  <em>By diverting 15-30 minutes each morning to read cognitive material, you will feel noticeable changes</em> .  This will serve as a good starting point for achieving your goals. <br><br>  For quite a long time such an approach <strong>on your account will be more than one hundred books read</strong> .  Your knowledge will not be limited to any one narrow sphere.  You will think and see the world differently.  In the end, you can calmly link several topics together. <br><br><h2>  Rethink your life vision </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/951/42b/646/95142b6469ba4564833b3ac725a4ba78.jpg"><br><br>  Your goals recorded anywhere have their own specific type - <strong>long-term</strong> and <em>short-term</em> .  By setting aside only a few minutes each day to read this list, you give yourself a promising set-up for the day. <br><br>  If you run long-term goals through yourself every day, you will think about them constantly.  If you think about them all the time, you will do the work to achieve your installations, and the latter will be realized. <br><br>  Achieving this goal is a <em>science</em> .  There is no confusion or ambiguity.  If you follow a simple rule, you can achieve any goals, <em>no matter how big they are</em> . <br><br>  The fundamental aspect of the recorded goals is to drive them through each day. <br><br><h2>  Do at least one thing that brings you closer to your long-term goal. </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/56c/2cf/95b/56c2cf95b62c4acea6507efbe8cdba3e.jpg"><br><br>  <strong>Willpower as a muscle</strong> is depleted from regular downloads.  Likewise, the ability to make high-quality decisions gradually conceals.  The more decisions you make, the more they lose in their quality, <em>the weaker your will power</em> . <br><br>  Consequently, the <strong>first thing in the morning is to perform only complex cases</strong> .  It is important! <br><br>  If you don‚Äôt do it right away, they will remain unfinished.  Because by the end of the working day you get tired and you have no strength left for them.  You boil.  There is a million and one reason to postpone this business for tomorrow.  And tomorrow you postpone the day after tomorrow.  <em>In this case, important things will never be fulfilled.</em> <br><br>  Thus, the following becomes your mantra: " <em>Unimportant matters are solved first, pushing the more important ones for later, which may simply not be enough time. And tomorrow it will be repeated again.</em> " <br><br>  If you are not scattered, and take into account only one big goal every day, you will understand that <strong>these goals are not too far away</strong> . <br><br><h2>  Finally </h2><br>  After you do this, no matter what matters until the end of the day, you solve important tasks first.  You get on the road to success, and gradually approach your dream. <br><br>  By adhering to such a plan, you will notice how your life is changing for the better.  Your results at work will be better.  Your relationships with loved ones will improve.  You will become happier.  You will become more confident.  You will become more courageous and resolute.  You will more clearly perceive the environment. <br><br>  Your life will start to change little by little. <br><br>  You will forget what it means if you got up in the morning.  These things will just leave your life forever. <br><br>  You will quickly find an occupation at work that will entice you. <br><br>  Your relationship will become more vibrant and deep.  This is great! <br><br>  You will be free and grateful. <br><br>  The world and the universe will begin to smile at you! <br><br><hr><br><br>  Original: <a href="https://medium.com/%40benjaminhardy/8-things-every-person-should-do-before-8-a-m-cc0233e15c8d">8 Things Every Person Should Be Before 8 AM</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/294192/">https://habr.com/ru/post/294192/</a></p>
