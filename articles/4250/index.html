  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Six potential YouTube buyers</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  All the hype that has recently risen around <a href="http://www.youtube.com/">YouTube</a> shows one thing: there is a cover-up fight.  Almost certainly one of the six companies listed below will buy YouTube shortly. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The presence of backstage trading is evidenced by the fact that various unofficial estimates of the market value of YouTube are constantly appearing in the press.  According to independent experts, it can reach $ 1 billion. <br><br>  It is unlikely that YouTube will be able to maintain independence in such conditions.  A private company was founded just a year and a half ago.  She has several ways of future development: to remain a private company, issue shares (IPO), or sell out to a large corporation.  Any of these three outcomes is possible, but the last is most likely.  Most likely, some of the large companies will buy YouTube.  Who will be the buyer?  There are at least <a href="http://blogs.zdnet.com/ip-telephony/%3Fp%3D1201">six options</a> . <br><br>  If you start the listing with the least likely candidate, then this is Adobe.  This corporation has created a Flash format that is used in most videos on YouTube.  Buying a video portal can turn it into a fantastically popular platform for promoting Flash, as well as specialized video editing and special effects programs, which are released by Adobe.

      Another candidate is Time Warner Corporation.  She is interested in promoting her content via the Internet. <br><br>  For the same reason, the buyer may be Sony, which also owns its own film studio and is interested in promoting its content via the Internet.  In addition, Sony is a manufacturer of equipment for shooting, processing and storage of video. <br><br>  Of course, the largest Internet corporations, which, in principle, can buy absolutely any Internet startup, are automatically included in the number of potential buyers.  For example, Google is showing an obvious interest in this sector of the market and even opened its own service for publishing <a href="http://video.google.com/">Google Video</a> videos.  This service is more serious in its focus: it is focused on long-term storage of large-volume films, while YouTube is a youth entertainment portal with short video clips.  It turns out that these two services complement each other quite well. <br><br>  Another possible candidate is News Corp.  Such a deal would look quite logical.  Indeed, last year News Corp.  bought a social network Myspace and it was a good deal.  In fact, Myspace and YouTube have a very similar audience of users.  Both sites belong to the generation of Web 2.0 and are designed for broadband communication channels.  We can say that they complement each other perfectly. <br><br>  But if YouTube really considers a lot of offers, then among buyers there may be one that looks most preferable: Yahoo.  This is the most likely candidate for the purchase for one reason: not so long ago, the company bought almost the same site, only for photo sharing ( <a href="http://flickr.com/">Flickr</a> ).  It‚Äôs safe to say that the Flickr audience and YouTube overlap very much.  Anyone who uploads photos on the Internet can also shoot short video clips on the same digital camera and also upload them online.  In fact, Flickr and YouTube are two of the same type of service for owners of digital cameras. <br><br>  Of course, the circle of applicants for YouTube is not limited to the six companies listed above.  Other potential buyers may be, for example, Microsoft (it is rumored that it is an analogue of YouTube) or Apple (as an addition to the iTunes digital music store). </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/4250/">https://habr.com/ru/post/4250/</a></p>
