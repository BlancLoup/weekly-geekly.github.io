  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The most spacious flash drive in the world! Kingston DataTraveler Ultimate GT Review with 2 TB of Memory</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  <b>Hi% username%!</b>  In the fight of the projectile and armor, that is, drives and a typical amount of data, something went wrong.  Instead of unusually capacious and tiny drives for USB 3.0, we got cloud storages with snooping and slippery usage rules, and archaic external hard drives that do not even reveal the potential of a nine-year SATA-III interface.  Today we are testing a happy exception to the rule - an ultramodern, most capacious flash drive with a capacity of as much as 2 TB.  How fast is it, what is the catch of ‚Äúrecord holders‚Äù flash drives and why do we even need 2000 ‚Äúhectares‚Äù in a lipstick-sized housing? <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/85d/cc4/5bb/85dcc45bb83245159793a5d27a4ce48a.jpg"><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  With technology, it happens sometimes - they conceived one thing, it turned out another, and time turned an innovation into something third.  The fact that more practical flash drives have replaced CDs and cassettes is gratifying, but these data are <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/kingston_technology/blog/275984/">getting fatter</a> from year to year, flash memory is being improved, but running capacious drives are still almost always mechanical, fragile and slow.  You won't send them inside laptops anymore, it's not very convenient to use them on the road.  Therefore, many do not use, and download their own files from the cloud at the cost of spending traffic on a smartphone (or even additional payments for tethering), or with the help of the public, you see, Wi-Fi.

      But for some reason, flash drives are stuck in strange roles: even relatively capacious (128-256 GB) models often transfer files between computers in cases when they are ‚Äútoo lazy to raise LAN.‚Äù  Because really solid flash drives with a reserve of capacity are vanishingly small.  And almost all of them are made by Kingston: in 2013, the world's <a href="http://www.tomshardware.com/news/Kingston-Flash-Drive-1TB,20247.html">first</a> terabyte USB flash drive with a capacity of 1 TB saw the light, and three years later the DataTraveler Ultimate GT appeared with 2 TB on board.  And that's all we know from the news, so it's time to dig deeper.  That is, to figure out whether the record-breaking capacitive drive will be really fast, for which such titans are needed and whether the flash king is different in appearance or in operation from just flash drives. <br><br><h2>  Angular and brutal </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/3da/77b/41b/3da77b41b7964472bd0b3230a85ab973.jpg"><br>  <i><s>Let's smoke, comrade, one by one</s></i> <br><br>  Morning, as you know, does not start with coffee, but unpacking the flash drive does not begin with the flash drive itself - the drive is located inside the metal case.  The case looks very armylike, although its peaceful purpose is to keep a flash drive, a carrying bag, and an extension cable.  The cable is needed in order to connect 2 terabytes even turned out to computers and TVs, in which the ports are closely adjacent to each other. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/08a/fc0/79a/08afc079a39049eeb44919dff8f8f8e7.jpg"><br>  <i>Package Kingston DataTraveler Ultimate GT</i> <br><br>  The drive has hardly changed outwardly since the terabyte predecessor, but it is so good.  Beautiful galvanized metal with durable paint, rectangular body without a hint of advanced aerodynamics and gaming flirting.  The case looks expensive and durable, unless you decide to open it purposefully.  And you still shouldn‚Äôt disassemble DataTraveler Ultimate GT, because only half of the case can be removed without serious consequences.  If you continue to be zealous, there is a risk of damaging the PCB and memory chips, losing the five-year warranty and getting a lot of sadness as a result of the manipulations.  Do not try this at home! <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/a51/367/a9d/a51367a9d652499e8db6cc1c54254063.jpg"><br>  By the design of the flash drive - slider, clicks when nominating the halves in the manner of vintage <a href="https://geektimes.ru/post/16125/">Finnish mobiles</a> (vintage, yep - feel old).  The connection standard is USB 3.1 Gen 1, that is, <a href="https://www.kingston.com/ru/usb/usb_30">USB 3.0</a> .  Universal Serial Bus developers love to add confusion to their designs. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/69d/0d3/efd/69d0d3efd0f84d5bbd1f04e756fc3a32.jpg"><br>  <i>The cable comes in handy when you need to connect the flash drive to a computer with an inconvenient USB location.</i> <br><br><h2>  <a href="http://www.kingston.com/datasheets/DTUGT_ru.pdf">Specifications</a> </h2><br>  ‚Ä¢ <b>Interface</b> USB 3.1 Gen 1 (USB 3.0) <br>  ‚Ä¢ <b>Capacity</b> 2 TB <br>  ‚Ä¢ USB 3.1 <b>speed</b> : 300 MB / s (read), 200 MB / s (write) <br><br>  Gigabyte, as it turned out recently, is a <a href="https://secretmag.ru/news/top-menedzher-megafona-suditsya-s-apple-iz-za-razmera-gigabajta-14-04-2017.htm">relative</a> concept, but according to the global standard, the actual capacity is 1,979,958,951,936 bytes, that is, we get approximately 1.79TB in terms of conversion.  The familiar MLC-memory is supplemented by the powerful <b>Phison PS2308</b> controller - it is, by the way, used in the fastest <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/kingston_technology/blog/266432/">HyperX Savage</a> .  Kingston promises up to 300 MB / s in sequential reading, and up to 200 MB / s in sequential write.  We check how things are in practice. <br><br><h2>  Testing </h2><br><h3>  Test stand </h3><br>  ‚Ä¢ <b>Processor:</b> Intel Core i7-7700K <br>  ‚Ä¢ <b>Motherboard:</b> ASUS Maximus IX Hero, Socket 1151 <br>  ‚Ä¢ <b>RAM:</b> <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/kingston_technology/blog/278986/">HyperX Predator DDR4-3000</a> 8 Gb (2 * 4 Gb) <br>  ‚Ä¢ <b>System SSD:</b> <a href="http://geektimes.ru/company/kingston_technology/blog/248898/">HyperX Predator PCI-E SSD 480 Gb</a> <br>  ‚Ä¢ <b>Video card:</b> AMD Fury X <br>  ‚Ä¢ <b>Power supply:</b> Corsair AX1200i, 1200W <br>  ‚Ä¢ <b>Operating system:</b> Windows 10 Professional (64-bit) <br><br><h2>  Test application: </h2><br>  <b>Crystal Disk Mark 5.2.0</b> <br><br>  A well-known test, which, probably, is not necessary to submit to the public, but for the protocol: <br><br>  An application that tests drive operation in four modes: linear read / write, read / write 4K blocks and linear read / write at a queue depth of 32 commands, read / write 4K blocks at a queue depth of 32 commands.  The unspoken standard in the disputes "my flash drive is steeper than yours!". <br><br>  <b>NTFS</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/f43/f23/bf9/f43f23bf9e764c3d9d4c7fb9cc7e9af9.jpg"><br><br>  <b>exFAT</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/af0/814/d07/af0814d074e848479654605d76beaa26.jpg"><br><br>  From the configuration of the computer, motherboard and other factors depends on the variation of numbers in the results, but our flash drive speed, almost identical to that promised by the manufacturer.  And, as you can see, in sequential operations it is several times faster than a hard disk, and by the standards SSD is very good.  For USB flash drives, this parameter is important, because you need such large flash drives to read and write data in gigabytes, but as soon as possible.  Videos, photos in RAW, music in lossless and similar pleasures that are scary to even ‚Äútry on‚Äù to 256 GB of ultrabook drive.  This is the element of fast capacious flash drives.  You can fill two terabytes to the outset in 3.5 hours (very quickly, taking into account how much and what specific stuff you can write to such a drive).  It is more efficient to use the ‚Äúthreshing‚Äù of small files, anyway, on the SSD - it‚Äôs written by them to interact correctly with arrays of service files of operating systems and programs. <br><br><h2>  How much? </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/89d/bd7/4e4/89dbd74e48834af8b55be25baaf4781d.jpg"><br><br>  "Stotyoshch!".  That is exactly 100 thousand rubles worth the most capacious flash drive with a five-year warranty.  Not cheap, let's be frank, but, like any other record holder, such a flash drive could not be available the first time after the start of production.  For example, the <a href="https://www.ferra.ru/ru/notebooks/news/2017/01/13/acer-curved-predator-21-x/">very best</a> laptop or server <a href="https://servernews.ru/947346">processor is</a> also not available.  But it's nice that the beginning has already been made, the price will decrease after the technology leaves the rank of exotic, and most importantly, you will not be left without fast capacious drives.  Kingston warrants! <br><br>  And if your mind is not disturbed by memory in flash drives, but by a super-fast ‚ÄúRAM‚Äù, do not miss the HyperX promotion for everyone: we <a href="http://hyperx.gg/GeektimesDDR4">give <b>a</b></a> <b>10%</b> <a href="http://hyperx.gg/GeektimesDDR4"><b>discount</b></a> on HyperX Fury DDR4 modules (in any color).
