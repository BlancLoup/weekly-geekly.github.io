      As a rule, for the good idea alone, "carpets do not lead the way" yet. <br>  It is important to state this idea, test, protect, materialize and implement. <br><br>  And between these 5 requirements, you can also insert a bunch of detailed additional requirements, most of which are related to finance and so on. <br><br>  Here and hundreds and thousands of our inventors languish in lack of knowledge. <br>  After all, even to start paying for a patent, not only a beginner can find an opportunity, and this is where everything can stop. <br>  To open an idea to a ‚Äúrich uncle‚Äù who, at best, will sponsor, but will require his equal rights to a startup, and at worst, will intercept the idea, and send it to you ‚Äúnext time‚Äù or ‚Äúcall back‚Äù ... <br><br>  So how to be?  After all, there are ideas, but how to implement them 100% and, of course, not to lose copyright? <br><br>  Of course, to begin with, it would be better to reserve somehow the date of the presence of this idea from you.  The fact that a notary is a witness is and yes and no ... After all, a noturius may ask for confirmation of your authorship, that he will not be assured of plagiarism.  And for this you need to submit a patent or an approved application to the Patent Office.  If such documents are notaries and not needed for nothing. <br>  A vicious circle is obtained. <br><br>  The best option for assuring the date of having an idea with you is to send the printed out (detailed idea with all the designs) to yourself to your home or work postal address.  Yes Yes!  Exactly. <br>  And you should send a registered letter with all the seals and receipts (it is desirable that the seal fell on the glued joint of the envelope for greater reliability).  A letter to send yourself with neobbhodimosti receipts.  Do not open the envelope, but stick all your receipts to it and hide it in a safe or so on. <br><br>  Well, the first part of the case is done.  But this is only the beginning. <br>  Before discovering the essence of your idea to any ‚Äúuncle‚Äù, make an agreement with him about the non-disclosure of the Submitted Information.  In America, such a contract is called NDA (Non Disclosure Agreement). <br>  In the contract, you must make a clear description of the topic, which you will share with another person. <br><br>  If it is not possible to sign such a contract in the presence of a notary, then it is worthwhile to attract witnesses (1 from each side). <br><br>  If in your opinion your idea has great potential in the future, then try to secure it as best you can.  If the prospective partner starts ‚Äúlaughing‚Äù with you and convincing you of ‚Äúchildish nonsense‚Äù about any contract, then perhaps malicious intentions may hide behind this.  I mean, that person can plan to take a ‚Äúcopy‚Äù of your idea and not take any responsibility for it. <br>  A decent investor partner, who is REALLY INTERINED in finding a new encouraging startup, will sign a confidentiality agreement and thereby prove his honesty towards you! <br><br>  To risk to open ideas without such a contract is tantamount to fermentation on infected sites without antivirus :-). <br><br>  Well, let's say you all signed and got closer to the point ... Try to explain the essence of the idea in a simpler and more understandable language.  Do not rush into technical terminology.  Your investor may turn out to be from a number of ‚Äúwild investors‚Äù (who have no idea about the nuances and subtleties of your business, but do their financial part well).  Do not be afraid of leading or criticizing questions.  Sincerity multiplied by optimism can more convince investors to cooperate with you than a 100% positive colorful picture of development.  Remember, investors have already eaten the ‚Äúdog‚Äù in the financial sphere and perfectly and soberly understand that they are still at risk. <br><br>  Well, if you have a well-planned business plan, a true, energetic team and finance, all subsequent problems are solved easily.  But most importantly, as soon as money appears, patent and copy your idea.  Do not wait for someone to do it for you :-) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/9698/">https://habr.com/ru/post/9698/</a></p>
