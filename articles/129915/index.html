Headache is enough for everyone - both designers and customers.  A lot of time is spent on routine - phoned, e-mail correspondence, sending back and forth file previews. <br><br>  In order to get rid of all the annoying delays and make working with media content easy, pleasant and efficient, there are specialized media resource management systems (Media Asset Management, abbreviated as MAM systems). <br><br>  We bring to your attention a story about such a system on the example of the BrandMaker Media Resources module.  Moreover, it is one of the key modules of BrandMaker, around which all the others are built on.  It provides centralized work with documents, images, multimedia data.

    <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Any MAM system rests on three "whales": <br><br>  <b>1. Central storage of media objects of any format</b> <br><br>  The core of the MAM system is the central base of advertising materials, which serves as a storage place for media objects of any format and type, such as individual graphic images, brochures, booklets, banners, as well as video and audio files - everything that can be attributed to advertising resources. <br>  Employees of the company can independently download the necessary advertising resources from the system via a local network or the Internet to use them in presentations or other advertising projects. <br>  The client company itself can customize which advertising resources can be used under a certain license and for certain purposes, as well as which employees will have access to topics or promotional materials.  Additionally, you can set the expiration date of the image or document. <br>  All these tools provide the best protection against the illegal use of marketing materials, make it impossible to use uncoordinated or outdated versions, violation of corporate style requirements. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/49e2b368/121ab900/3ed9963f/30106b1f.jpg">  " <br><br>  <b>2. Processing the source material before loading.</b> <br><br>  This may include a convenient document preview function - when you hover the cursor over the file name, a preview is displayed with basic information about the document. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/5e1a2365/b9b50c07/acb6bca3/c9e06fa7.jpg">  " <br><br>  When you click on a file, a preview window opens with more detailed information and the ability to page by page the contents of the document without opening it. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/82a5f34b/05cbc126/fdd3c96e/1193ae31.jpg">  " <br><br>  And finally, there is an enhanced preview function, with which you can, without unloading a document from the system, view it in detail.  And the previews are created on the server, without affecting the productive capacity of the computer of the end user.  Accordingly, the manager can view files, for example, the .indd format, without installing InDesign.  And even edit it, if there is a Web-to-Print module, which <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/BrandMaker/blog/129243/">we have already written about</a> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/e0cc8ae3/b3a78273/7657a673/db7a5737.jpg">  " <br><br>  Another useful feature for users is the automatic conversion of files to the desired format before they are directly uploaded. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/4fb8a0a4/9f91d58d/dbc9593a/cda41236.jpg">  " <br><br><br>  Here, of course, everything is within reason, and it will not work to <a href="http://bash.org.ru/quote/412587">convert .txt to .avi</a> .  :) <br><br>  Well, finally, I note two more useful features of the module. <br><br>  First of all, the module does not delete earlier versions of images and documents when consistently reworking a file (for example, an advertising layout).  So at any time, you can track the history of changes, go back to one of the previous stages. <br><br>  Secondly, the search function is particularly convenient, acting on the principle of Google, when the search result is displayed after entering one or more keywords.  The user can reduce the number of search results and make it more accurate, this will help him search by criteria: the amount of information, the format of data or images, as well as data access, etc.  The functions of sequential search by several tags (‚Äúin the found‚Äù), or by several tags at the same time are implemented. <br><br>  In addition, the data structure itself, individually developed for each client, helps to quickly navigate the information and simplifies the search for thematic and specialized material.  Thus, the search for the necessary media objects is significantly accelerated. <br><br>  <b>3. Integration with other modules and the creation of a complete system</b> <br><br>  MRM-system BrandMaker covers all marketing processes: from planning and budgeting marketing projects, creating advertising materials, to generating reports and analyzing results. <br><br>  "Media Resources", being a module for storing information, serves as a starting point for all activities in the framework of creating promotional materials.  To create advertising objects, both for print and electronic media, MAM-system offers all the necessary advertising projects that correspond to the company's corporate style and are stored in the central multimedia content database. <br><br>  Individualization of certain printed materials (advertisements, brochures or business materials) is carried out using the Web-to-Print module, and electronic materials for the Internet using the Web-to-Web module. <br><br>  When creating a new advertising material, the Task Manager module will help you - the main module for creating and managing tasks and workflows in the field of marketing.  At the end of the work materials are stored in the ‚ÄúMedia Resources‚Äù for later use. <br><br>  The Marketing Planning module helps in general activities in the creation of advertising resources: planning, budgeting, information sharing and the use of the developments of previous advertising campaigns and projects. <br><br>  Thus, being integrated into the MRM system, the BrandMaker Media Resources advertising storage facility provides a wide range of capabilities that go far beyond simple storage, management and preparation of media data. <br><br>  Thanks for attention!  Ready to answer your questions. <br><br>  BrandMaker Russia <a href="http://www.brandmaker.com/ru/">http://www.brandmaker.com/ru/</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/129915/">https://habr.com/ru/post/129915/</a></p>
