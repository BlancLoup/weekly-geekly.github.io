  <section class="page js-page"><h1>March 8 on the moon</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  44 years ago on March 8, 1971, the crew of Lunokhod-1 drew a figure-eight on the surface of the moon in two simple turns.  Beautifully designed pictures of the G8 were presented to female colleagues at the end of the working day with the signatures of desperate guys.  Having learned about the picture, the management of the administration and the state commission, scolded the crew for their self-will, and asked for pictures for their wives. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/ebd/f48/6fa/ebdf486fa0ea7d615f0e0ffb2a58be61.jpg" alt="image"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The driver of the moon rover V. Dovgan was the head of the crew‚Äôs party group.  At the end of March, the 24th CPSU Congress was to open.  V.Dovganu got the idea to mark this important event by drawing on the ground of the Moon the Roman number XXIV.  He turned to Boris Nepoklonov, the head of the operational research group of the USSR Academy of Sciences.  He was engaged in the most important work - navigation on the surface of the moon and worked with navigators, laying routes. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/364/49e/39b/36449e39bf224adf9ba4d074f7713b2d.jpg"><br>  <i>The photo is Boris Nepoklonov, sitting crew members Lunokhod.</i>

      The route was laid, but after ‚ÄúXX‚Äù they stalled to ‚ÄúI‚Äù because  with traces of approaches / wastes of Lunokhod to the inscription ‚Äúthe ending did not work out very well‚Äù, so they did not photograph the panorama - so that the embarrassment would not be known. <br><br>  On the morning of March 8, the fourth lunar day began.  At 3 o'clock in the morning across Moscow the solar panel was open.  At 11.30 pm the Lunokhod movement began and ended on March 9 at 1:39.  Before the session, the crew decided to congratulate the female colleagues on the holiday.  The idea and its solution were born spontaneously.  Eight made just - turned 360 degrees on the spot, moved aside so that the left side was on the trail and made another turn on the spot.  "Eight" turned out to be 4 meters.  The width of the Lunokhod is just over 2 meters.  The wheel is 23 cm wide. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/ebd/f48/6fa/ebdf486fa0ea7d615f0e0ffb2a58be61.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  After detecting moon rovers in the LRO photographs and even their traces on the lunar soil, the following image appeared: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/b76/a99/e1d/b76a99e1d5a98eeac2b03a2c353a4581.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  For me personally, the mystery that it is.  The size of the "eight" is much larger than 4 meters, and it is only twice the width of the Lunokhod and its gauge. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/5a2/de1/14e/5a2de114efb1b3349f372e16975ef6ad.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <i>Lunokhod picture LRO.</i> <br><br>  In 1973, by March 8, they prepared themselves more carefully - navigator Konstantin Davidovskiy had previously calculated the route for the driver. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/262/133/4be/2621334be34c443cc0e9922252196a4f.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  It is alleged that this panorama corresponds to the tracks photographed by LRO.  I doubt again because of the size. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/664/e13/69c/664e1369c31d6c967148462d11ec3c9a.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Those interested can search for the originals of the panoramas of the Lunokhod in the <a href="http://planetology.ru/panoramas/">Archives of the Laboratory of Comparative Planetology</a> . <br><br>  And finally, another story about women and Lunokhod.  There were two floors in the laboratory building, the Lunokhod control point was located on the second, and the conference hall was on the first one.  About 5 years ago, the building was demolished by Ukrainians for building materials (as well as the entire legendary center of space communications), so the appearance can be seen in the screenshot - the building in the background.  These windows on the second floor, behind Dovgan, were the control point of the Lunokhod. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/dc7/c13/dc4/dc7c13dc45a84e6aa582006cd8fd3640.jpg"><br>  <i><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DJueR-TIZBWw">Secret drivers of "unearthly technology"</a></i> <br><br>  On the ground floor, in one of the rooms, there was a conference room, and in the basement was a computer. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/521/13f/fc6/52113ffc62e44c8d8fdf55d8de29ebf3.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ebd/31e/cac/ebd31ecaccca46c79171f706e6208ec5.jpg"><br><br>  In addition to the participants of the Lunokhod program (about 150 personnel), other specialists also worked, for example, equipment that assembled and interfaced with a computer for the Almaz orbital station.  After <a href="https://rumlin.wordpress.com/2013/03/25/lunoxod-1-trudnyj-krater/">arriving at the crater</a> in December 1970, when outsiders in the pool room interfered with the crew, access to the second floor was restricted.  A duty attendant was put at the staircase, only passing by passes to the second floor. <br><br>  This staircase, or rather what was left of it, shortly before the building was finally demolished.  Screenshot from video. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d28/dfe/8c6/d28dfe8c671f41488e55f7e0acfb6607.jpg"><br>  <i><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3D9F4cYWBHyxs">abandoned nip-10.</a></i>  <i><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3D9F4cYWBHyxs">12.IV.2009.</a></i>  <i><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3D9F4cYWBHyxs">Part 2 of 2.</a></i> <br><br>  But all women on duty passed freely to the second floor.  The explanation is simple - on the second floor there was a female toilet. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/377253/">https://habr.com/ru/post/377253/</a></p>
