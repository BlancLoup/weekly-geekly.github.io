Someone does not see the prospects for professional development at home, someone just wants to change the situation and get to know a different culture, and someone is looking for a way to move for personal reasons.  EPAM Systems provides a unique opportunity for IT-specialists from neighboring countries to learn such a close, but at the same time unknown Belarus, and build a career in one of the largest IT-companies in the CIS. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f0d/5e1/440/f0d5e14401c24eeeaa1cb7352526f10f.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The relocation program has been in EPAM since May 2013.  During this time, more than 500 employees took the opportunity to change their place of residence and continue their professional development. Now the possibility of relocation appeared among IT specialists from neighboring countries who had not previously worked for the company. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b>Why precisely Belarus?</b>

      Belarus is a developed country with European values ‚Äã‚Äãand close mentality.  Here are friendly and hospitable people, always ready to help.  There is no religious hatred in Belarus, it is known for its tolerance.  In the ranking of countries in terms of life, published in the UN Human Development Report for 2013, Belarus has become a recognized leader among all CIS countries: a high standard of living, and at the same time - housing, education and cultural expenses are lower than in most Western countries and Eastern Europe. <br><br>  The mild climate, natural products, beautiful nature, a developed education and healthcare system, diverse cultural life and a dynamic IT environment make Belarus one of the most comfortable countries to live in the former USSR. <br><br>  <b>Why EPAM Belarus?</b> <br><br>  EPAM is the largest provider of project (custom) software development and solutions in Central and Eastern Europe.  Today the company has offices in 19 countries.  It was the office in Belarus, in Minsk, that became the first EPAM Development Center - the history of the company began with it.  Today, the Belarusian office is the largest division of the company in terms of the number of specialists employed. <br><br>  For each employee there is a project in accordance with his knowledge, professional and personal interests.  EPAM uses a whole range of technologies - both modern and well-known: Java, .NET, ASP.NET, BI, C / C ++, JavaScript, PHP, SharePoint, Oracle and many others. <br><br>  The company provides all the opportunities for professional and career growth.  The employee chooses how to develop - ‚Äúdeep‚Äù or ‚Äúwide.‚Äù  We promote freedom and flexibility in building a career - you can try yourself in different roles, move from direction to direction, learn new things, look for ‚Äúyour own‚Äù.  <a href="http://www.epam.by/relocation/benefits.html">An extensive social package is</a> also one of the advantages of working in a company. <br><br>  <b>How to get to EPAM?</b> <br><br>  The path to EPAM Belarus begins with <a href="http://www.epam.by/relocation/resume.html">sending a resume</a> to our recruiting service.  Resume processing usually takes several days;  After that, a recruiter will contact you by phone, Skype or email.  The task of such communication is to clarify your professional skills, technologies and methodologies that you used at previous places of work, as well as the reasons for changing your place of work and residence.  Even if you have an interesting work experience, but at the moment there is no suitable position for you, our recruiters will certainly continue the conversation in order to understand which of the projects you can apply for. <br><br>  <b>Moving to Belarus is easy</b> <br><br>  EPAM Systems provides legal, logistic and material assistance when moving.  If an employee needs visa support, it will be provided.  Transportation costs, including payment of baggage, are fully covered, both for the new employee and his family members.  In the first month of stay in the country, the company provides free living space.  The new employee and his family can enjoy all the bonuses from the company's social package, including free medical care at all medical centers working with EPAM. <br><br>  <b>You get used to good quickly</b> <br><br>  Sergey Malykhin, Senior Software Testing Engineer, moved to Belarus from Simferopol, works in one of the Minsk EPAM offices: <br><br>  ‚Äú <i>In native Simferopol, the IT market is narrow.</i>  <i>I didn‚Äôt see my career prospects there, so I began to look for other options.</i>  <i>I wanted to work in a large company.</i>  <i>At one time I seriously considered the Kiev office of EPAM, but then, due to the unstable situation in my country, I paid attention to the option of moving to Minsk and working in the Belarusian division of EPAM.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>Here I absolutely do not feel like a stranger, as if I had not moved.</i>  <i>Everyone is constantly wondering how things are, how I feel.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>The company really liked.</i>  <i>This can come as an experienced specialist, as well as a beginner.</i>  <i>EPAM provides everyone with a lot of opportunities to grow professionally.</i>  <i>And if a person wants to achieve something, there is every chance for that</i> . ‚Äù <br><br>  Interviews with Dmitry Lesny, a UX developer who moved to Voronezh from Minsk, can be read <a href="http://dev.by/lenta/epam-systems/dmitriy-lesnoy-k-horoshemu-privykaesh-bystro-ili-osobennosti-relokatsii">here</a> .  Relocation experience first hand! <br><br>  <b>And finally ...</b> <br><br>  Only in the period from August to December 2014, 26 employees relocated from the external market (Russia, Ukraine, USA, Moldova).  It‚Äôs a lot or a little to judge you, but these people decided to change their lives drastically and didn‚Äôt lose.  Therefore, as Dmitry Lesnoy said in his interview, ‚Äúif the inner voice prompts you to change the situation, you should listen to him.‚Äù <br><br>  You can read more about the relocation program, as well as fill out your resume <a href="http://www.epam.by/relocation.html">here</a> .  Good luck! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/249333/">https://habr.com/ru/post/249333/</a></p>
