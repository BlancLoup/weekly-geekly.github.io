According to some rumors, when you start the application, there appears only the ‚Äúrich man's mantra‚Äù, which you must definitely repeat every morning before breakfast. <br><br>  But like everything in this world, what can be created, broken and pressed - it will, in this particular case, be pressed.  What clearly demonstrates this screenshot.  And even in spite of the fact that he may turn out to be another fake, skillfully executed in Photoshop, I still want to believe in its truth.

      For people who do not speak the language of Byron and London (of which, I hope, every day less and less), I translate: <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><blockquote>  It is not joke.  I need someone from Apple to help me with this deception.  I saw this application with several friends and we, for the sake of a joke, clicked on ‚Äúbuy‚Äù, thinking that it was all a joke and decided to check what would happen.  I forgot that my wife activated iclick (if I'm not mistaken, this is transferring money from a bank card to an Apple Store account) to buy a laptop and the application was actually purchased for $ 999.  I called Visa and they confirmed to me that $ 999.99 had been requested from the card and now they are awaiting confirmation of the transaction from the store.  I explained that this was a mistake, but the bank insisted on having to talk to the store to check the sale before they could cancel it. <br>  This is the problem ... no one can contact Armin Heinrich (the author of the application) or Apple to help me.  Now I'm stuck between the two ends awaiting confirmation of the purchase transaction.  THIS IS NOT A JOKE ... DON'T BUY THIS APP AND, APPLE, PLEASE REMOVE THE APP FROM APPLE STORE ... APPLE MUST SHOULD START THESE FALSE APPS AND DECEPTIONS.  People get the benefits of buying in the App Store ... it will not end well ... BEWARE !!! <br></blockquote><br>  (the author's spelling is preserved, the translation is almost literal) <br><br>  What can be said about this ... the guy who pressed the "BUY" button with the thought that she is a joke, of course, is no victim of circumstances, but a complete idiot. <br><br>  Nevertheless, the moral of this fable is quite clear.  After the assurances that Apple will allow only high-quality applications to be sold, the online store, in fact, was filled with frank crap with zero functionality, 13th century design and, God forgive me, with ugly icons.  The latter should just make all Mac lovers furious. <br><br>  And the acclaimed I Am Rich application was promptly removed from the virtual store shelf.  Maybe in vain - would science be different jokers, like Lee5279xx. <br><br>  <a href="http://dvice.ru/blogs/techfun/598">Dvice</a> delivers. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/30792/">https://habr.com/ru/post/30792/</a></p>
