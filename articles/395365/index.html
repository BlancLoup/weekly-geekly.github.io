June 16 in the United States approved for use by the device to compensate for the effects of obesity, which is a simple but effective drainage system that is connected directly to the stomach of the "user".  The task of the gadget is to rid the stomach of an obese person from excessively absorbed food, and as a result, from those extra pounds. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/c23/98f/289/c2398f289ef2ae7db880d00d7a1b0ddb.jpg" alt="image"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Permission to use such a non-standard way of solving the problem was adopted on June 16 at the level of the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA), as was reported in an official <a href="http://www.fda.gov/NewsEvents/Newsroom/PressAnnouncements/ucm506625.htm">press release</a> . <br><br>  AspireAssist - the so-called device is a flexible tube that is endoscopically inserted into the stomach and fixed on the discoid valve to the surface of the abdominal wall.  After 20‚Äì30 minutes after a meal, the patient needs to connect an external tube to the valve and in about 5‚Äì10 minutes to remove the excess eaten.

In the vacated space is poured water.  Thus, the gadget solves two key problems of excess weight at once in the company Aspire Bariatrics, which created AspireAssist: a person gets rid of extra calories and controls body weight without having to sit on long, exhausting and not always safe diets. <br><br>  The patient using AspireAssist has to pay for regular visits to the attending physician to adjust the length of the drainage tube for the ability to maintain a familiar diet.  The fact is that by reducing the volume of adipose tissue and body weight without a corresponding correction, the tube can weaken the contact of the valve with the skin. <br><br>  AspireAssist registers the number of connections to external drainage and automatically stops serving the patient after 115 cycles (about five to six weeks of treatment), reminding the person of the need to see a doctor.  If the therapy needs to be continued, the replacement cycle limiter is replaced with a new one. <br><br>  The duration of the ‚Äúinstallation‚Äù of AspireAssist, according to the <a href="http://www.aspirebariatrics.com/about-the-aspireassist/">Aspire Bariatrics</a> website, takes no more than 15 minutes, takes place against a background of minor rehabilitation and does not require general anesthesia (the same methods of so-called ‚Äútwilight‚Äù anesthesia are used as in dental prosthetics).  Within an hour or two after such a mini-operation, the patient can safely go home. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/fioJ80dKa2I%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=25657,15700021,15700186,15700191,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhizsJm-STj7krLT_02aBX6bMnkdJw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  Remove AspireAssist also in laboratory conditions, which takes, again, 10-15 minutes.  The manufacturer emphasizes that due to the simplicity of the installation and manufacturing of the system, it costs an order of magnitude cheaper than the operation to reduce the stomach, which requires, in addition, many days of rehabilitation. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/nC6FkP5JZVk%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=25657,15700021,15700186,15700191,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhhAA-yTBo4LOJjz05izMahu976QxQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  The target audience of AspireAssist is people not younger than 22 years old with a body mass index ( <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2598%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BA%25D1%2581_%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B0%25D1%2581%25D1%2581%25D1%258B_%25D1%2582%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B0">BMI</a> ) of 35‚Äì55 kg / sq. M. Who cannot cope with the problem of obesity and are not able to maintain normal weight with non-surgical methods. <br><br>  The reason for the FDA decision was, on the one hand, the disappointing data of national statistics, on the other - the results of clinical trials in which 176 patients participated.  The entire experimental group received help with diet and a healthy lifestyle, and 111 participants in the experiment agreed to additionally install AspireAssist.  After a year of wearing the device, they lost, on average, 12.1 percent of body weight versus 3.6 percent of the rest of the control group, and some of the patients managed to completely say goodbye to extra pounds.  It can not be said that treatment in all 100% of patients was rosy.  Of course, there were also transient side effects: dyspepsia, nausea, vomiting, constipation and diarrhea, as well as a short-term feeling of local discomfort after surgery. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/5af/fb0/74f/5affb074fe3e5a304fb5b9d1195c32ff.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The need to develop surgical methods for treating obesity became apparent after it became clear that diet, exercise and drug therapy could not solve the global problem of the obesity epidemic, which reached the level of a national problem.  The most radical types of interventions offer stomach reduction operations (gastroplasty).  At the same time, operations are quite complex and traumatic and are not suitable for all patients.  An impressive amount of contraindications is the method of imposing intestinal anastomosis, which helps to turn off part of the stomach from the digestive process. <br><br>  Compared with the above-mentioned methods associated with surgical intervention, endoscopic operations are much better tolerated and, which is important, are reversible.  In this way, for example, gastric balloons are set, by inflating which it is possible to regulate the volume available for the food to be absorbed.  Aspiration, which provides AspireAssist is also quite simple and low-impact, but has a number of inconveniences, unaesthetic and is associated with the need to empty the stomach. <br><br><hr><br>  That's all, with you there was a simple service for choosing sophisticated <a href="https://dronk.ru/">Dronk.Ru</a> equipment.
