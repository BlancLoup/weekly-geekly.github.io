  <section class="page js-page"><h1>First commercial experience in the development of games on Unity 3D</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  We want to talk about our first experience in developing games on Unity 3D.  It was necessary to create a national theme game for the social site <a href="http://el.kz/">El.kz.</a>  We have long wanted to create games and were pleased with this news and wanted to try something new.  We looked forward to the victory, because the games were not so difficult, but at least some experience in creating games we had.  4 mini-games had to be done in three months, according to our calculations, we would have done it in two.  But as often happens the ship called ‚ÄúWaiting‚Äù collides with the iceberg ‚ÄúReality‚Äù and goes to the bottom, the same happened to us.  The customer said that he wanted games on flash, but as we didn‚Äôt explain to him that very few people use this technology now, and they are gradually abandoning it.  But he did not care, and even if he did, he could not do anything, since the order was state-owned and the flash games were written in the order drawn up a year ago.  We didn‚Äôt have a choice, either we create games or they are looking for other developers, but the desire to create games and make money overpowered us and we set to work. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  While there were negotiations on the subject of games, we developers thought about how we should be.  We had two choices: the first was to learn the language of Action Script and create games on it, the second to make the same games on Unity 3D, because it was cross-platform and we wanted to create games on it.  But the trouble is the flash technology is not supported by Unity as we thought, and the engine creators refused it.  At that time, all our games were made on the free version of Unity 3D and there was no flash platform.  And they began to search on the forums about the engine and flash.  Everywhere it was written that games on flash are not relevant, but we stumbled upon one post where it was written that in the paid version of the engine it is possible to convert to flash.  We decided to check if this was true and downloaded the crack version of Unity, and luck was that we found what we were looking for.  Writing games on Unity and converting them to flash, fortunately for us, there was no limit and we started to work. <br><br>  Everything went well. After a month, we made two games and proceeded to the third.  There was no game design and we began to ask what happened to him when the drawings were ready, but it turns out that the designer, besides us, worked for others and did not have time.  He threw off not a complete design for the first game, but customers did not like it.  In the meantime, we were finishing the third game and began to think about the fourth one, because it was a bit problematic.  You ask what about the fourth, the fact is that this game is a continuation of the existing game on the site ( <a href="http://el.kz/games/509">here</a> ) and for many years, we did not receive the source code of this game because it is ancient and there are no contacts of the people who developed it.  I had to decompile the flash game.  A couple of hours and we pulled out all the resources that were required for the second version of the third game, and then invented bicycles on a crutch, so that the second version ( <a href="http://el.kz/games/31106">here</a> ) was no different from the first.  All games were ready, except for one, as always there was not enough design, because it is not ready yet.  And here's a miracle, the mountain gave birth to a mouse, the long-awaited design of the game was ready, and we did not slowly start work after the rest. So the summer passed, which we didn‚Äôt really remember as hard work, making bicycles and crutches. <br><br>  We started classes at the university, so we had to find time to work, we spent whole days after the couples in the library finishing the games, because the customers did not like what they wanted last month.  One programmer had to take on the work of the artist and draw the missing elements of the games and at the same time finish the games, another instruct on the introduction of these games and on their documentation.  As for the source code, it is written in C # and there is no Action Script there, in this form we presented them to the customer.  So it took four months to create games and launch them instead of the planned three.

      During this time, we paid attention to such things as: technical task, time management and copyright laws that we violated.  About Unity 3D, we warned them to get a paid version of the game engine.  At the end of September, we received money for our work and this hell stopped, after we hear the word state order, we remember this hellish summer, which taught us to dodge and invent clever plans.  Link to one of the games, the design of which we have been waiting for ( <a href="http://el.kz/games/31108">here</a> ). <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/31e/bc9/7bf/31ebc97bf45b40e8bf6ccf417defe5de.png"><br></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/292808/">https://habr.com/ru/post/292808/</a></p>
