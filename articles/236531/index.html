The post describes in more detail what the ‚ÄúDark web‚Äù is. <br><br><h4>  What is "Dark web" </h4><br>  The dark web, sometimes referred to as ‚ÄúDarknet‚Äù (dark Internet) or ‚ÄúDeep Web‚Äù (deep web) is part of the online shadow market.  Dark web is a specialized group of sites where the identity of each user is hidden from the authorities, trackers and law enforcement agencies.  Regular search engines and standard web browsers cannot see the Dark web pages.  In essence, this is a private virtual space where people act anonymously to achieve their goals. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/94f/56c/e21/94f56ce21e0b481f9e7ffa7a5b92c950.jpg">

    <a name="habracut"></a><h4>  The purpose of the "Dark Internet" </h4><br>  The goal of Dark web is to provide complete anonymity online with a security guarantee, where users can virtually interact with each other and not be afraid of the law.  The dark web contains forums, informer blogs, pimping services, online markets, documentation resources, etc. <br><br>  Positive: if you look, the Dark web serves as a haven for democracy and anti-corruption.  Here informers can report corporate and government misconduct to the press, without fear of persecution, declassify corrupt practices that are hidden from the public.  This network reigns complete freedom of speech and information.  Dark web is also a place where people from despotic countries or repressive religions can find like-minded people and even get help.  And of course, the Dark web is a haven for journalists and people with a very unusual way of life, to communicate on the network and not fear reprisals. <br><br>  Negative: Dark web has a dark side.  It acts as a black market, where you can buy or sell anything, any smuggling, a stolen item or illegally obtained information.  Drugs, weapons, stolen credit card numbers, various pornography, money laundering services and even hiring killers are all on the Dark web. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/717/15c/614/71715c614d7d45cba306c30e04097299.jpg"><br><br><h4>  How Dark Web Works </h4><br>  To work in Dark web requires the installation and use of special software.  For this you need to be quite an experienced user.  There are two options: I2P (Invisible Internet Project) protocol and TOR (The Onion Router) protocol.  These are two different technologies that make work anonymous. <br><br>  TOR is a system of proxy servers that allow you to establish an anonymous network connection, protected from eavesdropping.  TOR sites use the .onion domain name.  Dark Internet Surfing is usually faster with TOR. <br><br>  An I2P network is overlayed, resilient (disabling a node will not affect network operation) and anonymous.  When transferring data between network nodes, encryption is used.  In terms of speed, it is inferior to TOR, but I2P is more stable in front of law enforcement. <br><br>  In both cases, Dark web works using sophisticated mathematical encryption to encrypt the identity, network, and location of the participant.  All network traffic jumps from server to server around the world, which makes tracking impossible.  The exchange of messages is carried out using pseudonyms not related to the real person.  Most cash transactions use bitcoins and third-party deposit services to protect the buyer and seller from unfair trade. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/8a3/a88/ffa/8a3a88ffa7d74588af2a2ea263f11a68.png"><br><br>  To participate in I2P or TOR, you need to install specialized encryption software, a special web browser.  In the case of making purchases, you need to buy Bitcoins and install a Bitcoin wallet. <br><br><h4>  Payment for goods and services in the Dark Web </h4><br>  Since PayPal or credit card payments provide personal information, Dark Web prefers bitcoins.  In many cases, the third-party deposit service will act on behalf of both the buyer and the seller‚Äôs name, acting as a trusted intermediary in exchange for commission. <br><br>  Bitcoin exchanges are carried out using anonymous account numbers (as well as Swiss bank accounts, but with more disguise).  These anonymous accounts are called ‚Äúbitcoin wallet‚Äù.  It is important to remember that bitcoin is not a regulated currency.  Therefore, in the case of fraud or dishonest financial transactions will not work to contact the bank for a refund. <br><br><h4>  Deposit Mediation </h4><br>  Deposit services provide the intermediary with the opportunity to act as a trustee.  The intermediary checks whether the buyer really has money to pay.  Further notifies the seller that everything is in order.  Before transferring funds to the seller, the intermediary waits for confirmation of the shipment of goods to the buyer. <br><br>  Deposit services are sometimes provided by the darknet market itself (for example, the Nucleus website promises deposit and dispute resolution services for all of its customers). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/76c/f68/7cc/76cf687cc2994fb182b328e64b1c87a6.jpg"><br><br><h4>  Smuggling supply </h4><br>  Just like parcels from Amazon, the Dark Web smuggled goods are shipped by regular mail or courier service.  The risk of buying on the Dark Web depends on the actions of law enforcement.  Indeed, in different countries their own laws that relate to the verification and opening of the parcels. <br><br>  In the US, mail and delivery services use x-ray, dogs and visual inspection to detect smuggling.  If smuggling, drugs, weapons and everything that seriously violates the law are found in the package, the government can appoint an undercover agent to deliver to its addressee.  And with the help of tricks to pull out from the recipient the recognition that he knows about the contents of the parcel. <br><br>  <a href="http://netforbeginners.about.com/od/weirdwebculture/tp/What-Is-the-Dark-Web.htm">Original article</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/236531/">https://habr.com/ru/post/236531/</a></p>
