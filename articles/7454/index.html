  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Online dating</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Phew)) <br>  Here is such a relevant topic for today) <br>  So ... let's start! <br><br>  Communication is simply necessary for a person - therefore, it is quite natural that a person is looking for this communication.  And besides life, such a wonderful thing as the Internet can serve as a real source of communication and new acquaintances.  Fortunately for the Internet, there is no such thing as distance - thus there are no boundaries for communication and dating.  Therefore, it is not at all surprising that there is such a wonderful thing on the Internet as dating sites, where all conditions are created for communication and dating.  And if they are, why not use them? <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  It is impossible to unequivocally answer, good or bad, such communication has its drawbacks and its advantages.  The downside, of course, is that virtual communication is still not real life.  Often, the Internet knocks a person out of reality, and he loses the skills of interacting with people in a normal environment. 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>

        </script>
      <br>
      However, the Internet helps shy people to overcome their lack of complexes and the fear of communicating with the opposite sex.  It is with the experience that a person gets when communicating virtually that both shyness and awkwardness in communication disappear. <br><br>  Another disadvantage of virtual dating is that people get frustrated with each other when they meet in real life.  Indeed, often, a person builds the image of a virtual partner at his own discretion and according to his imagination, only based on his description of himself.  In addition, the description is not always true - many often embellish themselves and exaggerate their merits.  However, virtual dating is convenient because, strictly speaking, they do not oblige to anything.  You can always break the conversation, if a person is not pleased with something, has not approached or just disliked.  Acquaintance on the Internet is usually with several specific goals: communication, flirting, sex, marriage / marriage.  When filling out the questionnaire on dating sites, you should immediately indicate why you want to communicate, so that there is no misunderstanding. <br><br>  The dangerous moment of online dating is that no one guarantees the accuracy of the questionnaires, including photos.  After all, the photo can be edited, corrected, or even send someone else's.  Here one should be careful not to rush into the pool of passions, but try to get to know a person better and meet him. <br><br>  Quite often, people search on the Internet just for communication - in fact, it‚Äôs just interesting to communicate with new people from other cities and even countries.  Especially for them there are dating sites, which have all the conditions for full and interesting communication.  As a rule, such acquaintances do not have any serious or even serious consequences - but the friendship may well turn out from this. <br><br>  Our life dictates its own conditions - and for such a wonderful thing as an easy and non-binding flirt there is not much time left.  The Internet is very suitable for such entertainment - among other things, there is a great opportunity to communicate with several people at once.  Again, quite a few people have just such a goal.  Therefore, dating sites that are focused on a playful and frivolous flirting are not worth getting around with your attention.  Again, this can go into a very serious relationship. <br><br>  However, there are often people who have quite serious intentions.  In the end, the communication in the network allows you to get to know the interlocutor well - however, it gives you the opportunity to interrupt the communication at any time when you want it.  That, you see, is not always easy in reality.  And, of course, there are online dating sites, whose visitors are mainly focused on serious relationships.  And, believe me - not a few weddings and many happy ones became the result of dating on the corresponding site. <br><br>  Well, absolutely inevitably popular sites for dating with foreigners.  Russian brides abroad are popular - and this is due to no vulgarity at all, just our girls are not spoiled so much by feminism and other emancipations.  A man still needs to feel like a man - and next to an emancipated feminist who perceives a proposal to help carry a heavy bag as a personal insult is somewhat problematic. <br><br>  The disadvantage of such acquaintance with foreign citizens is that girls often respond readily to an invitation to come, while no one guarantees the responsibility of a person on the other end of the earth, where the "bride" will not have anyone to ask for help.  Therefore, if you still decide to go abroad to the potential groom, stay with friends, relatives or in a hotel.  Still, it is better to invite a man to come to you - with high probability it can be argued that the scammer will not go to Russia.  And you will feel much more confident at home. <br><br>  Even if your relationship is developing rapidly, and he has already offered a hand, heart, home in Malta and a snow-white yacht, do not rush.  Do not hesitate to ask to take a look at his passport and find out if he really is the one for whom he accepts himself, because you are going to go with him to a completely unfamiliar country where no one except him can help you. <br><br>  When meeting, try to be natural, this is what foreigners in Russian women value.  After all, it will prevent you from properly assessing your chances of success in living together, and often very little time is given to it. <br><br>  Of course, the means of communication are very limited - in fact a lot of information is transmitted by intonation of speech, facial expressions, gestures, and this is not available on the Internet.  But this is just a reason to show imagination and creatively approach the process of dating and socializing. <br><br>  Most importantly, perhaps the advantage of finding a couple on the Internet is a huge choice.  Hundreds of girls and guys, men and women leave profiles on sites.  In this case, using the search for certain parameters, you can easily find the perfect partner. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/7454/">https://habr.com/ru/post/7454/</a></p>
