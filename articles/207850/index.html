You will say that this is strange, because the person who played the game should already know about its disadvantages.  But, to my regret, I often see that the players complain about the shortcomings of the game.  But at the same time, they are dumped on the enemy, then on the players from their team, then simply on the fate and on the excess of cosmic rays.  That is, the shortcomings of the game are visible, but not everyone has enough experience to associate these shortcomings with the game itself. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h2>  Why should I expose the flaws of the game Tanki Online </h2><br>  I have been watching this game for more than 3 years.  And I see in it players who have stayed in it much more than mine.  I noticed such a tendency that the game literally educates people, instills in them their values.  This is natural, because in order to reach the rank of generalissimo you need to play more than one year and not two.  What I saw is that people in this game lose the meaning of the notions of ‚Äúcommand actions‚Äù, ‚Äúcohesion‚Äù, ‚Äúhonor‚Äù and ‚Äúcultural communication‚Äù.  In any battle, even if it is a team, the interaction of players in your team and players from different teams is like a stir in a hen house.  No self-organization, just sheer rudeness in both words and deeds.  I sincerely fear to see such behavior of compatriots at the sight of a common danger in the real world.

    <h2>  A little bit about the game itself and its advantages </h2><br>  The game is the first of browser-based three-dimensional action movies.  That is, the client part of the game is the browser itself and you do not need to download and install anything.  This is very attractive.  Because it is enough to open the Internet browser and you are already in the game. <br><br>  This game with a rather attractive theme is tanks.  Armament is also pleasantly diverse. <br><br>  The game has collected a multimillion mass of the people and you will find a rival in it on any day and at any time of the night. <br><br>  In general, this is where the advantages of the game end. <br><br><h2>  About disadvantages </h2><br><h5>  Flash </h5><br>  The first and still just annoying, rather than a tragic minus: the game is made on the technology of Adobe Flash.  This technology is rapidly becoming obsolete and is already deprived of browser support everywhere.  Even Adobe himself has already indicated that he understands the inappropriate further support of this product and is going to focus on other projects.  This means that the game in the popular Ubuntu operating system today will give you much less pleasure due to the more problematic installation of the Flash plug-in, due to much worse graphics, due to much bigger brakes and problems with switching the keyboard layout. (You can drive a tank only on the English layout, and you need to write games to chat in Russian, otherwise they will not understand). <br><br><h5>  Consumables </h5><br>  One of the biggest disadvantages is that the monetization of the game is aimed at selling off consumables that are used in the battle.  Since this is a free to play game, it is logical to assume that by playing without making real money in the game and relying only on your skills, you can have every chance of winning. <br><br>  However, this game is not so: <br><ol><li>  Daily prizes at the entrance to the game in the form of a small set of consumables for often not enough for 10 minutes of the game.  The rest of the mass of consumables has to be purchased for game currency, which, and so only in the butt is enough to pump a tank.  And consumables cost a lot. </li><li>  If you want to play in a battle in which no one will use consumables, then this option is available.  However, for entering such a game you will have to pay in game currency.  That is, you still have to pay.  But besides, even if a player went into such a battle, 4-5 people would be able to keep him company.  That is, the game will not take place. </li><li>  When using the consumables, the player receives a ‚ÄúGod mode‚Äù for one minute.  At this time, the player is twice as fast, twice as tenacious, his shots are twice as powerful and, in addition to everything, having a critical level of health, you can once again restore lives to 100%. <br><br>  The formula is simple: <br>  ‚ÄúNormal player‚Äù * 2 (speed) * 2 (reservation) * 2 (destructive power) * 2 (ability to restore lives to 100%) / 2 (human factor and randomness factor) = 16. <br><br>  That is, the effectiveness of the tank increases by one minute 16 times.  Often you had to watch as a player in a heavy tank "Mammoth" using consumables from a cannon with a high-explosive projectile "Thunder" alone shot the entire enemy team (12 players) in a team game.  Further, to use the next batch of consumables you need to wait only half a minute or self-destruct.  The use of consumables is limited only by their number, that is, with a huge supply of consumables, you can use the ‚ÄúGod Mode‚Äù almost continuously.  This suggests that if a player does not have consumables, and the enemy has them, then there is no chance of winning.  Except when your opponent has not mastered the basics of the game. </li></ol><br><br>  <b>We summarize</b> : No self-respecting free to play game allows the player to be God at the expense of paid consumables throughout the game, as this automatically makes the game literally <b>paid</b> . <br><br><h5>  Earnings in battles and the distribution of the game fund at the end of the battle </h5><br>  Earnings in battles is the only way to replenish the reserves of game currency without resorting to making real money in the game.  However, he thought so that the opinion about the game becomes much worse, even against the background of the policy of imposing consumables.  This minus is not so obvious in the "all against all" game mode.  But in the other three game modes, which are commanding, this minus simply catches the eye. <br><br>  Let's say two teams are playing.  The game often lasts 5 hours.  Each of the players knocked out at least a hundred enemy tanks and earned a lot of game points.  Someone in the team is more active, more cunning and more agile.  Plus, he also uses consumables.  So the sum of his points is at least twice as much as the sum of points of those who at least did not use consumables, but still possess the same skills.  It turns out the following table of players of the winning team at the end of the game: <br><br><table><tbody><tr><th>  Players </th><th>  Points by the end of the game </th><th>  Prize </th></tr><tr><td>  Player 1 </td><td>  7643 </td><td>  12276 </td></tr><tr><td>  Player 2 </td><td>  3633 </td><td>  2764 </td></tr><tr><td>  Player 3 </td><td>  2045 </td><td>  876 </td></tr><tr><td>  Player 4 </td><td>  2021 </td><td>  854 </td></tr><tr><td>  Player 5 </td><td>  1050 </td><td>  236 </td></tr><tr><td>  Player 6 </td><td>  986 </td><td>  204 </td></tr><tr><td>  Player 7 </td><td>  811 </td><td>  136 </td></tr><tr><td>  Player 8 </td><td>  377 </td><td>  24 </td></tr></tbody></table><br><br>  Total prize fund for the whole winning team: 17370. <br>  The total amount of points earned by the team: 18566. <br>  The table shows that the first player having 41% of the total mass of points received 70.8% of the fund as a prize. <br><br>  This player was lucky, because he beat not only the opposing team, but his entire team.  All players, even in the winning team except the first player, received only a modest consolation prize.  It turns out that each player gets in a geometrical progression a smaller prize than the one who is higher in the rating at the end of the game.  It is not only that it undermines the team spirit of the game, it generally makes the word ‚Äúteam‚Äù not applicable to this game, since no player will give all the best, knowing that at the end of the game only one player from the whole team will receive the prize. . <br><br>  What entails the appearance in the team player quickly gaining points: <br><ol><li>  It undermines team spirit. </li><li>  Players start leaving the game without waiting for it to end even in the winning team. </li><li>  New players, even if they enter the game, are not with the goal of supporting the team, but with the goal of just having an idle time (picking up drops, catching gold, etc.) </li><li>  The remaining players are not laid out in full when playing with the opponent, do not try to change the course of the game playing for the losing team and do not try to consolidate the advantage in the winning team.  Most often, they are boringly fighting off the enemy while collecting crystals (drops) falling from the sky - small particles of game currency, which literally sabotage the positive dynamics of the game and the team often loses. </li></ol><br><br>  <b>We summarize:</b> instead of joy, this policy of distributing the prize fund only brings disappointment to everyone except the player who has scored the maximum points in the winning team, and sometimes this leads to a change in the course of the game only because the players lose the sense to play further. <br>  Why not make a formula for calculating the prize: for each player: (fund) * (number of points) = (prize).  Let the fund be not such a big number, but the prize will please everyone and will correspond to the efforts of the player. <br><br><h5>  Pumping system </h5><br>  It does not please the pumping system in the game.  Since the game is free to play, we will consider the option of pumping without making real money in the game. <br><br>  The game has several options for guns, hulls and a wide variety of colors.  Recently, micro-pumping has also become available.  These four aspects are the key and only aspects of pumping.  The choice of hull determines the speed, maneuverability, tensile strength and size of the tank.  The choice of the gun determines the style of attack.  The choice of paint causes a set of resists (protection from the attack of certain types of guns).  At this stage, everything seems quite acceptable.  But there is one aspect: the hulls and guns have modifications (levels of steepness).  You can modify the body and the gun 3 times.  The first modification is zero.  Each of the next three takes the weapon to a new level.  And each level of improvement becomes available only after reaching a certain rank.  That is, you need to pump a rank of approximately 1/50 of the maximum in order to acquire the second modification, then the next level becomes available approximately at the rank of ¬Ω of the maximum rank and, eventually, having almost or even directly the maximum rank Bleed the weapon and body to the maximum.  Modifications of the gun are incomparably more expensive than the gun itself, and each subsequent modification is also incomparably more expensive than the previous one.  Thus, playing without making real money, the player will be able to timely buy guns and body modifications for only one gun and for one body.  In rare cases, it will be possible to pump three things in a timely manner, for example, one body and two guns. <br><br>  If, having reached the title, on which it is possible to acquire a new modification of the cannon or corps, the player does not acquire this modification, then he will become easy prey in the battle for all the players of his title, but already acquired this modification.  And the players of his rank with a modification already purchased will be many.  This becomes logical based on the fact that every battle in the game has a limitation on the ranks of players who can get into it and it turns out that once a player enters the battle, they will necessarily meet opponents with a title at least not less than their own. <br><br>  <b>We summarize:</b> The player in the process of the game saves the game currency not to become steeper in the game, but in order not to be the only weakling. <br><br><h2>  Why, despite all the flaws, do people play this game? </h2><br>  Firstly, this is all the same attractiveness of a browser action movie.  Secondly, this is a huge number of players who are already in the game - they will not be lonely.  In the third, the most important point is that on the initial titles the game is very generous to the player and the above described cons almost do not make themselves felt.  All these disadvantages appear only after a week of the game, when the player has already sucked. <br><br><h2>  Afterword </h2><br>  I hope I was able to convey to you the glaring flaws of one of the most popular games created in the CIS.  I also hope that people who read the article will think before they get back to this game.  If you have something to add to the list of cons of the game with aspects unnoticed by me, then write in the comments.  As soon as I get out of the sandbox, I will immediately supplement the article with your opinions. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/207850/">https://habr.com/ru/post/207850/</a></p>
