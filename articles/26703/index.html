  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Why i use linux</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  I wonder why when people like or dislike something, they want to make everyone share their opinions.  I don‚Äôt like Java - they write that only bylolockers are programming on it, the operating system wasn‚Äôt like it - they write that the OS is not suitable for any normal person. <br><br>  I will not point fingers at Leonid Kaganov, as an example of how disgusting personal opinion may sound if you try to summarize it at all.  I just want to describe why Linux has been living on my home computer for the last five years, and why I‚Äôm not going to change it in the near future. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  1. The first and most important reason is HABIT.  Double-edged reason, because of habits, many will never be able to change the wasps.  They will pay money, fight viruses, save money for upgrade.  Only when once did WinXP spontaneously download ServicePack2 from me, and thus unexpectedly making work on an old laptop impossible, I more than once jumped to Linux on a regular basis.

      <br>
      2. The second, important reason - RELIABILITY.  Computer problems are inevitable.  Playful pens, viruses, problems with iron.  I always want to be able to quickly continue my work. <br><br>  After experimenting with alternative axes, I had a loader flying.  I loaded from cd, did chroot and continued to work in my native system. My motherboard burned, I took the hard drive, inserted it into a new computer and continued to work as if nothing had happened. <br>  There is no registry, which means that it is not a problem to urgently reinstall with saving all the settings.  The migration of 32-64 bits for me was absolutely painless. <br><br>  3. The reason for which it is difficult for me to work under the systems manufactured by Microsoft - UZABILITY.  Yes, I like Gnome.  I cannot, without negative emotions, use Vista, mainly because the size of many dialogues cannot be increased.  And I like it so much that in text configurations I can comment out something, try it and, if anything, return everything as it was.  Snapping windows, which appeared back in Winamp, is a very convenient thing, especially when working with a toolbox.  Compiz-plugin displaying non-overlapping reduced copies of all windows - so much more convenient than poor switches on Alt-Tab, that I even refused from the taskbar. <br><br>  4. No viruses.  Yes, maybe they are not, because Linux writers are not interested.  So that's great.  Now I can not care about which antivirus to choose and how to set up this damned firewall.  Already, the gksudo and policy kit only bother me when necessary.  And now, anyone can compare the complexity of the procedure of removing a shortcut from the system menu under Gnome and Vista, and see where the distinction between privileges works better. <br><br>  5. Well, and this, perhaps a strange reason - MONEY.  Linux is free, most programs are free, and all I may need from commercial software is no more expensive than Vist'a + Office.  The Photoshop Elements that I got with the camera works fine under wine, it suits me, and I don‚Äôt need its completely new version for XXX bucks. <br><br>  6. And finally - INSTALLATION OF PROGRAMS WITH ONE CLICK.  A true user friendly approach.  No one will ever convince me that the ability to poke the next button five times is absolutely necessary when installing software. <br><br>  Habit, convenience, sensation of reliability and predictability.  What else do you need to ask from the operating system?  Pick up the iron for the operating system and live in peace.  To hell with all these holivars. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/26703/">https://habr.com/ru/post/26703/</a></p>
