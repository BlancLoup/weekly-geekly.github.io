She specializes in serving the IT infrastructure of customers (IT outsourcing) and works under the <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maykor">Maykor</a> brand.  A source close to the negotiations clarifies: this is not about buying the company as a whole, but only shares in it - an additional issue of shares.  Rostelecom expects that it will be more than 50%, a source close to it adds. <br><br>  The interlocutors of "Vedomosti" claim that Maykor sells the package because of its financial problems.  One of its subsidiaries, <a href="http://maykor.com/">MDG Service</a> , won in a closed auction of the Ministry of Internal Affairs and received an advance of 2.1 billion rubles.  The company placed the funds received in the Russian Credit Bank.  However, the representatives of the Ministry of Internal Affairs were not satisfied with the work done by the ‚ÄúMDG-service‚Äù and demanded that the advance be returned.  But the "Russian loan" by that time went bankrupt and it was not possible to withdraw funds from there. <br><br>  Rostelecom promises to pay off MDG debts just for the amount in which the acquired package is valued: the transaction may turn out to be practically cashless, an employee of one of the competitors, Maykor, believes. <a name="habracut"></a>  The amount received from Rostelecom will be used to pay off the debt, <a href="http://www.vedomosti.ru/technology/articles/2015/11/25/618253-rostelekom-mozhet-kupit-lidera-rossiiskogo-it-autsorsinga">transfer</a> to Vedomosti with reference to the participant in the negotiations.

      Maykor provides services for computers and corporate networks, provides data storage systems, and also undertakes the maintenance of accounting and tax records of client companies.  In addition, it installs business applications on clients 'computers, manages the engineering infrastructure, and serves customers' office equipment.  The company was founded in 2010.  Maykor has 5200 employees, 83 branches and more than 400 service units in Russia.  In 2014, Maykor's revenue amounted to 10.89 billion rubles, which is 17.4% higher than the previous year. <br><br>  "SPARK-Interfax" calls the owner of the Service Holding Company Cypriot "Macor Outsourcing Services".  In 2013, the Russian Direct Investment Fund ( <a href="http://www.rdif.ru/">RDIF</a> ), the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development ( <a href="http://www.ebrd.com/ru/home.html">EBRD</a> ) and the <a href="http://ifcext.ifc.org/ifcext/spiwebsite1.nsf/ProjectDisplay/SII32117">Capman Russia II</a> Foundation became co-owners of Maykor.  Then they called Maykor the leader of IT outsourcing in Russia.  Sources of "Vedomosti" told that by investing $ 100 million, investors received "20-25%."  Analysts of Sberbank CIB then estimated Maykor at $ 300-400 million excluding debt. <br><br>  Since then, the assessment is unlikely to change, given the pace of development of the IT sector, says analyst of Otkritie FC Alexander Vengranovich: "Such companies survive only through government contracts."  Gazprombank analyst Sergey Vasin believes that Maykor‚Äôs rough estimate is about 15 billion rubles. <br><br>  Rostelecom and Maykor already have common projects, people who are close to the operator say.  In early September, it became known that Rostelecom Retail Systems, which is responsible for the development of Rostelecom‚Äôs retail network, on the basis of tenders, concluded contracts with MAYKOR for the cash register service in sales and service centers in the Far East, the Urals, the Volga region, and in the Central District and in Moscow. <br><br>  Maykor provides technical support for cash registers in more than 500 network offices.  Among the tasks to be solved are registration of CCV in tax authorities, commissioning, replacement of EKLZ, repair and advisory support of users. <br><br>  ‚ÄúToday the retail network of Rostelecom is at the stage of reforming, the goal of which is to create an effective diversified company with high standards of sales and service organization and developed remote services.  The transfer of auxiliary tasks, such as technical support of equipment, to outsourcing allows us to concentrate our own resources on the implementation of this key goal, ‚Äùcommented Margaret Kucherenko, general director of Rostelecom Retail Systems, on the conclusion of service contracts. <br><br>  Since last year, the outsourcer has been implementing a long-term contract for printing service and technical support of automated workplaces at the offices of Rostelecom in the Volga region, servicing customer‚Äôs office equipment in the divisions of St. Petersburg and the Leningrad Region, as well as carrying out a number of communication infrastructure maintenance projects. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/296716/">https://habr.com/ru/post/296716/</a></p>
