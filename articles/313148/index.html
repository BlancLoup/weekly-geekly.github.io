This year - <a href="https://tadhack.voximplant.ru/">for the first time</a> in Moscow. <br>  We are pleased to all participants who have survived and presented their prototypes.  And we want everyone to know about the most impressive projects! <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h3>  <b>TADHack winners in Voximplant nomination</b> </h3><br>  In total, 18 teams participated in the Voximplant nomination, including 9 from Moscow and 9 from other locations.  The jury from Voximplant tried to be as impartial as possible and divided the prize pool of $ 3,000 as follows: <br><br><blockquote>  ID4T, Moscow - $ 1 000 <br>  Smartis, Moscow - $ 500 <br>  Virtual Healthcare Triage, Ny York - $ 500 <br>  Hack 2, Stockholm - $ 300 <br>  News hub, Moscow - $ 300 <br>  Vcall_bot, Moscow - $ 200 <br>  Instavid, Boston - $ 200 </blockquote><br>  And now about each project in more detail.

      The main local prize, which was fought for in Moscow, is the Voximplant nomination.  The ID4T (Ideas for tomorrow) team won the $ 1,000 prize.  The guys presented a project that connects the owners of smart homes and emergency services responsible for smart solutions.  In case of suspicious situations, the ‚Äúsmart system‚Äù notifies the homeowner and the emergency service.  If one of them is not connected to the Internet, a request is sent to the Voximplant cloud, and the call is sent to the cell phone. <br><br>  The ID4T team chose the Voximplant platform because it works with Russian numbers, can recognize voice and has a user-friendly interface for the developer. <br><br>  ‚¨ù <a href="https://youtu.be/rgcLfJp5Z8Y%3Ft%3D1h40m5s">Link to Youtube ‚Üí</a> <br><br>  The SMARTIS team made a simultaneous voice translator between people talking on the phone via GSM without an internet connection.  Prototype made based on Google API and Voximplant. <br><br>  ‚¨ù <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DrgcLfJp5Z8Y%26feature%3Dyoutu.be%3D2h8m30s">Link to Youtube ‚Üí</a> <br><br>  From Ny-York, the guys presented the VirtualHealthCareTriage project.  According to the University of California, 40-50% of visits to hospitals can be completely transferred to a virtual environment.  This would save 11 million dollars.  The Triage application has several levels - chat bot, voice call, video call, and at the last - an invitation to a personal meeting with the doctor. <br><br>  ‚¨ù <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3Dp54IvwefCl4%26feature%3Dyoutu.be">Link to Youtube ‚Üí</a> <br><br>  A team from Sweden made a communication service for social workers. <br><br>  ‚¨ù <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DhCgFE9R_OqA">Link to Youtube ‚Üí</a> <br><br>  Especially for publishers, the News Hub team presented a platform for working with video bloggers and civilian journalists.  As is known, exclusive content is especially valuable for publishers.  Using this platform, according to the response from the publisher, video streaming is possible, as well as video recording. <br><br>  ‚¨ù <a href="https://youtu.be/rgcLfJp5Z8Y%3Ft%3D1h20m48s">Link to Youtube ‚Üí</a> <br><br>  If you are not satisfied that Telegram does not know how to call, it means that you are not the only one!  The vcall_bot team presented a video chat for Telegram. <br><br>  ‚¨ù <a href="https://youtu.be/rgcLfJp5Z8Y%3Ft%3D2h12m19s">Link to Youtube ‚Üí</a> <br><br>  From Boston, the inSTAvid teams made a service that can stream, that is, online broadcasting, onto a recorded video. <br><br>  ‚¨ù <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3D_lvkDZhc-yE%26feature%3Dyoutu.be">Link to Youtube ‚Üí</a> <br><br><h3>  <b>And more projects in the nomination Voximplant</b> </h3><br>  Unfortunately, it is impossible to give out prizes to everyone, otherwise the contest will lose all meaning.  But we really liked all the projects, and therefore we want to talk about other teams that fought for the prize in the Voximplant nomination. <br><br>  Opensoul presented a service for online interviews.  The applicant receives a list of questions and records the answers using the service.  Then he can choose - send or not send video.  One of the creators of the service was faced with the fact that he attended many interviews and did not fit for various reasons.  In his opinion, many issues can be solved remotely and not waste time as a recruiter, and the applicant. <br><br>  ‚¨ù <a href="https://youtu.be/rgcLfJp5Z8Y%3Ft%3D26m47s">Link to Youtube ‚Üí</a> <br><br>  The Minisol team made an assistant who recognized the voice.  The meaning of such an assistant can be assessed, for example, by the support service specialists.  During the conversation, say, with the client, the assistant recognizes the voice, translates it into text, finds the stop words, and gives them hints for them.  The assistant can be integrated with a search engine or with a knowledge base for a specific subject. <br><br>  ‚¨ù <a href="https://youtu.be/rgcLfJp5Z8Y%3Ft%3D58m11s">Link to Youtube ‚Üí</a> <br><br>  TheVillage presented a bot for voice calls in Telegram. <br><br>  ‚¨ù <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DMOhWwFXS5Ao%26list%3DPLtqT7syZpCVLZgoqakFrp2uhufu7hcizG%26index%3D2">Link to Youtube ‚Üí</a> <br><br>  Pin brain - made a prototype of a smart corporate database.  API can be integrated into Telegram, can quickly find data and access to communication services.  For example, he can find an employee‚Äôs phone and immediately connect using Voximplant. <br><br>  ‚¨ù <a href="https://youtu.be/rgcLfJp5Z8Y%3Ft%3D2h57s">Link to Youtube ‚Üí</a> <br><br>  And, of course, not without VR.  The multiparty VR conf team with Voximplant did a video conference.  If the two are at a short distance from each other, the mute function is turned off, and they can see each other. <br><br>  ‚¨ù <a href="https://youtu.be/rgcLfJp5Z8Y%3Ft%3D2h24m23s">Link to Youtube ‚Üí</a> <br><br>  At this Moscow teams in the nomination Voximplant ended. <br><br><h3>  <b>Moscow telecom projects in the nomination Carrefour</b> </h3><br>  The team with the cutest name, "Kitties", showed the project in the Carrefour nomination.  The assistant integrated with Messenger can tell you: 1) what products you buy with what you have already chosen, 2) food recipes - and give out the shopping list that is needed for these recipes. <br><br>  ‚¨ù <a href="https://youtu.be/rgcLfJp5Z8Y%3Ft%3D1h49m22s">Link to Youtube ‚Üí</a> <br><br>  In the same nomination team Grocery Shopper.
