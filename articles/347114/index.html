This year we went further and decided to arrange a two-day music festival Positive Hard Days.  We invite music bands from technology companies in Russia and the CIS to participate. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  The idea to hold a music festival on PHDays has long been in our heads.  We performed the first approach to the projectile in 2016, when we organized a mini-festival IT Music Fest, in which musical groups from ABBYY, Kaspersky Lab, Mail.Ru, and Positive Technologies participated.  The experience turned out to be successful, and we decided to scale the festival and invite famous musicians and experts to the jury, and groups of major technology companies as participants.

      We want Positive Hard Days to become not just a festival, but a grand celebration on which colleagues in the workshop will be able to perform on the same stage in front of a large audience of the forum, and all those involved in information security and IT - from the very heart come off. <br><br><h2>  The terms of participation </h2><br>  Musical groups consisting of three to eight people performing music in the genres of rock, pop-rock, and rock-and-roll can become participants of the festival.  A prerequisite: at least one of the group members must be an employee of an IT or IT company. <br><br>  To participate you must send an application to the address: <a href="">music@phdays.com</a> .  In the application in free form, you need to specify the name of the team and the number of participants, attach a short story about the group with a photo in good quality, as well as 2 songs (links to video or audio) - one of your own compositions and a cover version of the famous group's hit rock, pop rock or rock and roll. <br><br>  Applications are considered by the jury of the festival, which includes famous performers, producers, editors and journalists of music publications, television channels, as well as representatives of IB and IT companies. <br><br><h2>  Selection stages </h2><br><ul><li>  Applications are accepted until April 2. </li><li>  The selected groups will be invited to the semi-final auditions, which will be held on the PHDays forum on May 15 and 16, 2018 in the Moscow International Trade Center.  Each group will perform with a 20-minute set before the jury and participants of the PHDays forum. </li><li>  Announcement of the winners - May 16. </li></ul><br><h2>  Prizes </h2><br>  The author's tracks of the festival finalists will be included in the music collection and published on the CD-ROM, as well as posted on Yandex.Music and iTunes.
