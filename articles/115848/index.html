Ie, anyone can make a request ‚ÄúI am going ...‚Äù then indicates the address, and those who want to earn some money as a private carrier do not monitor whether this wonderful passenger is located next to them.

    <a name="habracut"></a><br>  Next, we will describe step by step what actions were taken to search for investment in our startup project. <br>  1. Undoubtedly a prototype project was prepared.  You shouldn't go to the investor with your bare hands. <br>  2. Sent applications for participation in all offline start-up events (harvest, start-uppoint and others).  I must say at such events it is more likely to look for a team, investors in the hall 1-2 people for whom more than 30-50 people gather.  In principle, we managed to find an excellent developer at one of these ‚Äúgatherings‚Äù, but whether it is worth visiting them to search for investments is an individual question and depends on the specifics of your project. <br>  3. Walked through old acquaintances and friends, received in response only "guys, money from the air - the occupation is not interesting." <br><br>  As it seemed to us, the problem is most likely in our idea and we seriously thought about whether it is worthwhile to continue the search for investments and the actual development of the project itself.  Before everything is put on the back burner, I decided once again to google, as a result of which I came across several sites related to the subject of search for investments. <br><br>  1. <a href="http://www.napartner.ru/">Napartner.ru</a> - start-up projects exchange <br>  2. <a href="http://www.biznessbomba.ru/">Business bomb</a> - a portal for entrepreneurs <br>  3. Finatica - business portal <br><br>  It seemed to me that all the sites were good and we added our project to all of the above, suddenly lucky.  It has been less than a week since the posting of information about our project as we began to receive questions from potential investors regarding the concept of our idea.  Applications came mainly from Napartner, having studied their investor base a little, we realized that waiting for a clear sky over your head can be infinite (investors rather wait for offers from startups, rather than vice versa) and started a manual search mode for an investor, you can read their catalog here ... <a href="http://www.napartner.ru/catalog/investor/0">www. napartner.ru/catalog/investor/0</a> <br><br>  Every day I believed that the next investor would be ready to provide the required amount.  And one fine morning we received a long-awaited message from Dmitry Ch. ‚ÄúHello, do you have an executive summary?  Where can we meet to discuss your idea? ".  Fortunately, these metrics and executive summaries were ready, we collected all the most necessary things and moved to Moscow in the Novokosino area.  The conversation took place, as we later learned, with quite influential personalities in the ‚Äútax business‚Äù area, we briefly spoke about the investment attractiveness of our project, partly touched upon the issue of monetization and other points.  Of course, it was worth waiting for the answer ‚ÄúWe will think,‚Äù however, a few days after our meeting, Dmitry Ch. Called us and told us the good news about attracting the necessary amount of investment. <br><br>  After all that has been experienced, I want to say that the future of your ideas is in your hands, but finding a investor today is a very sensitive issue, I hope my story will help you. <habracut></habracut></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/115848/">https://habr.com/ru/post/115848/</a></p>
