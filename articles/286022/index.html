  <section class="page js-page"><h1>About self-education in IT</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  It is not a secret for anyone that in the modern world the rhythm of life is such that due to the heavy work schedule we have very little time for family, home and education.  Lack of sufficient time for the latter makes it impossible for us to study and work at the same time. <br><br>  However, there is a way out - self-education, which we will now discuss. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  What is self-education </h4><br>  According to the definition from <a href="http://ru.wiktionary.org/wiki/%25D1%2581%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BC%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B1%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B7%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B5">Wiktionary</a> , self-education is the acquisition of knowledge through self-study, outside the school and without the help of teachers.  If in more detail, then we can say that self-education is a type of education in which a person expands and deepens, and also improves his knowledge of something. <br><br>  A person faces self-education throughout life: starting from childhood, when a child tries to master something and ending at a mature age, when it replaces the second higher education.

      Now consider the pros and cons. <br><br><h4>  pros </h4><br><ul><li>  <b>Opportunity to study anytime, anywhere.</b>  In self-education, the student chooses when it is convenient for him to study.  He can also study anywhere: at home, traveling, in general, wherever there is Internet.  But it is not necessary for training, as there is specialized literature on sale devoted to the subject of IT. </li><li>  <b>The ability to learn only what you need at the moment.</b>  When a person studies at a university, he, as a rule, studies everything, even if the majority of the university program has already been mastered.  In the case of self-education, you can choose to study only what we have forgotten. </li></ul><br><h4>  Minuses </h4><br>  In addition to the pros, there are always disadvantages: <br><ul><li>  <b>Price.</b>  It may seem that self-education is free.  This is not true.  As in the case of ordinary education, self-education must be paid.  In this case, we pay for software or hardware, for Internet traffic, which is generated by downloading software, we also pay for specialized books and magazines that may be needed during training. </li><li>  <b>Ability to distract.</b>  When we are studying at a university or at a training center, nothing distracts us from the passage of this or that material.  At home we can be distracted, forgetting that we have to go.  Therefore, a person undergoing self-education needs discipline and endurance </li></ul><br><br><h4>  Conclusion </h4><br>  Self-education or the second higher education is a personal choice of everyone, but if you chose the first, then you must remember that a person has certain qualities in order to successfully pass through self-education.  First, it is discipline and perseverance, which were discussed in the section on the disadvantages of this type of training.  Secondly, a person must be able to choose the information that is needed when studying exactly the topic he is passing through, otherwise the result will be different. <br><br>  Good luck in your knowledge!  And remember that knowledge is power, without which you cannot be a good IT specialist. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/286022/">https://habr.com/ru/post/286022/</a></p>
