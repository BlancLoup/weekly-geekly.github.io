We prepared for it and performed quite decently, taking the second place.  For the project, the Galileo board and the Arduino programming environment with modules in Python were used.  Our team consisted of four people. <br><br>  I learned about the <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/article/259239/">second hackathon in St. Petersburg by</a> chance, in just two weeks.  There was no time to prepare, so the project came up with a simple one - AMP (Autonomous Mobile Platform - Autonomous Mobile Platform), somewhat apart from Intel's IoT, but in the subject of mobile robots, which I know very well. <br><br><img src="http://./img/44/01.jpg" alt="image">

      <b>Project goal:</b> Development of mobile robot management software, which is independent of the hardware chassis. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b>Plans:</b> Bring a couple of your platforms to the event from other projects.  On the hackathon, switch control to Edison and write control software. <br><br>  <b>Life:</b> It so happened that he left Moscow only with a glue gun in his backpack, no one could go from the team either. <br><br>  <b>Hackathon Timing (time plus minus):</b> <br><br>  08:50 - Stood in the queue.  Everything is as usual: Intel forces the atmosphere, saying that the development kits are only the first to arrive. <br><br>  09:20 - Received the package and was surprised at the content: a notebook, pen and PSU for Edison!  And where is the fee ?! <br><br>  10:30 - Presentations started.  Introduction to Edison, Intel IoT Cloud Analytics, IoT and Microsoft Azure. <br>  Here, the progress was fully manifested - the speaker led the presentation of Microsoft on Skype!  Representatives of iGo3D started working with 2 3D printers, offering participants printing of any stl-files. <br><br><img src="http://./img/44/29.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  13:00 - Announced dinner and began to distribute fees and sensors.  They were not given out at the entrance, probably because those who came for a freebie would also listen to the presentations first, enrich themselves, so to speak, with knowledge.  As soon as the boards were distributed, some of the tables were freed and the very hungry ate at the second lunch box. <br><br><img src="http://./img/44/57.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  13:30 - A series of pitch sessions.  The meaning of this session is that in one minute you need to present the project and designate who you need in the team.  I needed two people in the team: a node.js specialist and someone who would prepare the presentation.  And they were found, thanks to the guys Alexey and Oleg for their help!  Basically, the participating teams were already completed, and this is a good indicator, which suggests that the people were preparing. <br><br>  14:00 - Unpacked the boards and started to run Edison and install the XDK.  And then the Internet died ... <br>  It is not surprising - more than a hundred participants are more than a hundred sets of ‚Äúlaptop + phone / tablet + Edison‚Äù, and the grid in class C space is only 254 addresses. <br><br>  14:30 - Compiled a list of additional details, for which I had to stand in line again.  We were pleased with the participants who tried to find out from the girl who kept records of the issued details, what would they take this for their project.  So, received: motor controller, motors, voltage divider and PIR.  It is clear that from this mobile robot you will not collect.  Need a platform and power.  And the internet was still lying ... <br><br>  15:00 - Switched to the mobile Internet.  Alexey continued to pump the IoT Kit, and I rushed over to the shops and bought 2S LiPo 1000ma, a return terminal, charging to the LiPo, electrical tape, wire, arduino power connector, wheels and wooden rulers. <br><br>  17:00 - Returned to the hackathon.  Alexey, meanwhile, put the XDK and dealt with the voltage divider.  On Skype, I asked the team designer for 2-part designs for printing, a hub-adapter for motors for wheels and a thruster for the third point.  He literally did it in 10 minutes and sent it, thanks, Pasha!  I gave the stl-files to the guys from iGo3D to print and began assembling the robot. <br><br>  18:00 - The organizers have deployed several more WiFi points.  The people began to slowly disperse and the Internet came to life. <br><br>  19:00 - Again, well fed. <br><br>  19:30 - Assembly finished, with the exception of printed parts.  Made a three-point chassis from rulers, thermal glue and blue electrical tape.  Boards and sensors fixed on the glue, motors - on the glue and electrical tape.  We are trying to start an engine driver with Alexey - and he is in no way. <br><br>  20:00 - Intel consultants recruited for help, they advised to update the libraries, and the driver started.  Alex went home to sleep. <br><br>  21:00 - Printed details.  The assembly finished, fixing these details on the glue. <br>  There is a robot!  Now it's up to the software.  Since several pieces are ready, the battery is removed from the battery and the motors spin, there is still a little bit to complete the program at least - writing to the cloud, managing via the web and mixing it all into one program. <br><br>  I started with the cloud, found 6 examples and began to understand. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/fb8/e67/398/fb8e67398b46478cb3e0783a5c6907df.jpg"><br><br>  00:00 - Pizza and beer.  Thank you, it was on time!  The brain was already boiling.  There were fewer and fewer people, but those who remained worked hard. <br><br>  04:00 - All examples worked without errors, but they did not write to the cloud.  At around four o'clock in the morning, already in Kamatoz, he blinded his version and the recording went. <br><br>  04:35 - Stretched his legs.  I went to bed, on the ottoman, on the stage.  How good!  There were no problems with the ottomans, those who wanted were occupied by two.  The most persistent continued to work. <br><br>  08:30 - Embarked.  Washed. <br><br>  09:00 - Woke up.  I had breakfast.  And again for the code.  Now for the control system. <br><br>  11:00 - People are gradually pulling up and the Internet starts to lag again. <br>  Alexey says that he will not come and gives advice on Skype. <br><br>  12:30 - Lunch.  In addition to the participants, spectators and judges begin to catch up. <br><br>  13:00 - the Internet is dead.  He died all.  Switching on points gave nothing. <br>  The version is ready, but check it out without the Internet in any way!  It is hard, difficult to develop Internet things without the Internet.  I sit in Skype on my mobile, swear on the Internet, and they ask me how I am on Skype without the Internet? <br><br>  14:00 - Oleg sends a presentation of 9 slides, starting to remake.  It turns out 11, of which 6 are taken from the original. <br><br>  15:00 - Begin to collect presentations.  I rent one of the first.  Already I want to quickly speak. <br>  Those who made the project are turned off.  Those who did not, partially leave.  The organizers are asking to turn off the Internet to everyone who does not use.  And at this moment it is possible to reach the board and check the code.  EVERYTHING works for us! <br><br>  16:00 - Start of presentations.  Many, many things - smart homes, augmented reality, universal things, neuro-interfaces.  Horror, how interesting! <br><br>  My presentation went well, I showed the whole presentation, but I could not demonstrate the work - the presentation camera did not want to change to the light.  So, neither the laptop screen with graphics from the cloud, nor the control buttons, which were shown, were visible. <br><br>  Upon my return home, I took a short ‚Äúinterview‚Äù with my son, who is my main tester of robots. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/BCJQYE03Jok%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700023,15700186,15700190,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhgNFykLZEfyoXLPtXDgvj5ynlH4rQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> <br><br>  20:00 - Rewarding. <br>  1st place - Heat radiation detector - deserved, a brilliant solution, success for the guys! <br>  2nd place - the project SensoDrive - the guys came with good home-made blanks and showed themselves to high quality. <br>  3rd place - the project Maestro - I was not impressed.  High-quality and beautiful homework from the video, site and presentation, and a poor, ridiculous prototype.  On the demonstration of the prototype, it remains unclear whether he earned in the end, or not. <br><br>  After all this, there was a raffle for all sorts of activities - selfies, tweets, completed questionnaires and a description of the project.  Prizes were mainly played by a random generator, and I was lucky to become the happy owner of the BASIS watch. <br><br>  <b>Summary:</b> In general, I was pleased with the hackathon.  He himself showed me that I can assemble a mobile robot from scratch on an unfamiliar hardware and in an unfamiliar programming environment and make it work.  It is a pity for the time and nerves spent fighting the Internet, perhaps, without this, the result would have been more significant. <br><br><h4>  Few links </h4><br>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/intel/blog/239801/">First hackathon Intel IoT Roadshow</a> <br>  <a href="http://geektimes.ru/company/intel/blog/242208/">Intel report on the first hackathon</a> <br>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/article/259239/">The second hackathon Intel IoT Roadshow</a> <br>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/intel/blog/261747/">Intel report on the second hackathon</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/262253/">https://habr.com/ru/post/262253/</a></p>
