And for more than 60 years, the world has been ecstatically reading books and watching films about the adventures of the brave Brit in the service of Her Majesty. <br><br>  An important component of the success of the works of Fleming was that Bond uses all sorts of high-tech gadgets.  This attracted the interest of the widest segments of the population, including technogists.  Over time, all these high-tech toys, dangerous and not too, became the business card of Agent 007. And on the birthday of Ian Fleming, we decided to recall the most interesting gadgets that James Bond used. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h1>  Dr. No, 1962 </h1><br>  <b>Dosimeter based on Geiger counter</b>

    <img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/04b/cdb/824/04bcdb8246a2451abd7daae31e85e41f.jpg"><br><br>  The first gadget that appeared in the films of Bond.  Although this box generally hardly fits the concept of "gadget".  But make a discount, this is the beginning of the 1960s, the element base was very, very different.  But the design of the controls of this unit is made just in the spirit of the fashion of the time, which gives a special charm. <br><br><h1>  From Russia with love (From Russia with love), 1963 </h1><br>  <b>Wristwatch-noose</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/11c/c4c/555/11cc4c5555b846e6b9b036ff808a5350.jpg"><br><br>  Interesting idea.  On the one hand, it is possible without any suspicion to have on hand a noose that can be very quickly reached.  But there are some doubts about the usability.  It is anatomically unnatural for us to use the wrist of one hand and the wrist of the other at the same time.  But everything is decided by training. <br><br>  <b>Pager</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ab8/fb6/688/ab8fb6688c3e4ac684eb314ca721cf6d.jpg"><br><br>  For the year 1963 - a bad thing.  But the modern youth did not find the massive use of pagers.  True, the Bond unit had only the function of a sound signal, about which display and display of the text of speech did not go then. <br><br>  <b>Car-based mobile phone</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/faf/eda/10d/fafeda10d96643609f8e0c3fe3593e5b.jpg"><br><br>  The pager immediately fades in the background of this device.  Your phone in the car!  Incredibly cool!  Many more years will pass before the mobile phones installed in the car become available to wealthy customers. <br><br>  <b>Detector telephone bugs</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/7cf/64b/a45/7cf64ba45a0f42119fcf6117860580ba.jpg"><br><br>  A simple device designed to detect wiretaps installed in the phone.  Design all in the same style of the sixties. <br><br>  <b>Camera with built-in voice recorder</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/601/0ed/1f7/6010ed1f79254ce7b3dcffd0aa4be3ec.jpg"><br><br>  Recorder "a la 60s" was, by modern standards, completely non-pocket-sized tape recorder.  Although at that time it was a miracle of minimalism, given the built-in tape recorder in the body of a full-fledged camera. <br><br>  <b>Poison thorn in boot</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/67c/448/973/67c4489731c544b0bc4b3be5ea003248.jpg"><br><br>  It is unlikely that this could be called a gadget, perhaps it would be more correct to say ‚Äúinstrument‚Äù.  If you click on the heels, then from the toe of the right shoe pops up a steel spike with poison applied.  When a poison enters the skin or in the blood of the victim, she has only 12 seconds of life left. <br><br>  <b>Decoder LEKTOR</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/039/bcf/648/039bcf648a6549cf93a7c58391a46b6a.jpg"><br><br>  The decryptor that Bond hunts.  It looks like a typewriter and is equipped with 24 character and 16 code keys.  In the story, LEKTOR is able to decrypt top-secret Soviet broadcasts. <br><br><h1>  Goldfinger, 1964 </h1><br>  <b>Lighthouses for location tracking</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/436/1cc/957/4361cc957a394e1e93ccabc00bdc1466.jpg"><br><br>  There were two devices.  The fact that the larger, allowed Bond to pursue the villain's car, focusing on the display, hidden in his own Aston Martin DB5.  Despite the fact that the development of GPS will be initiated only after 9 years, the Big Lighthouse has a range of 240 km.  The Little Lighthouse has a more modest "combat radius." <br><br><h1>  Thunderball, 1965 </h1><br>  <b>Infrared camera</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e64/c02/a0e/e64c02a0eedf48c981d143fd08aa47af.jpg"><br><br>  In those days, it was possible to fix the image of the surrounding world only on a film with a photosensitive layer.  Films existed a great many, negative color and black and white, reversible (slide) and special.  The latter also included films with enhanced sensitivity in the red part of the spectrum.  When using special filters, they allowed photographing in the infrared range, which gave a specific image.  By the way, Soviet children had an urban myth that if you take a picture of a person on an X-ray film, you‚Äôll get naked in the picture without clothes.  Oh, if it were true ... So, Bond had a camera that allowed him to shoot in complete darkness on an infrared film, in batches of up to 8 shots. <br><br>  <b>Jetpack</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/99d/1e7/ab2/99d1e7ab28d84e9fa95eb76bed503f84.jpg"><br><br>  The coolest thing, even in modern times.  In the film, this device is capable of carrying a person for 600 meters or hanging in the air for 4 minutes. <br><br>  <b>Pocket device for underwater breathing</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/dea/ebd/1f0/deaebd1f0e724ef7aa198ce56bae89a9.jpg"><br><br>  Enough to hold the mouthpiece with your teeth, and you can briefly introduce yourself Ichthyander.  Or the Little Mermaid, as you like.  Thanks to two gas cartridges a breathing mixture is formed, which lasts for 4 minutes. <br><br>  <b>Radioactive "beacon" to track the location</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/3a0/59b/e9f/3a059be9f93043e09ca6e37bb0deeaff.jpg"><br><br>  Unlike the gadgets from the previous film, this weakly radioactive capsule could be swallowed, and then you could be tracked with the help of a certain scanner.  Let us leave aside the questions regarding the required radiation power, the distances of paths in the atmosphere and human tissues of alpha, beta and gamma particles, as well as the mysterious design of the scanner. <br><br>  <b>Underwater propulsion</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f82/a89/5ef/f82a895ef213464ba3f6df637af41ff9.jpg"><br><br>  Although it is not a gadget in the classical sense, but it is impossible to pass by it, as well as by the knapsack.  Structurally, the propulsion unit was an aqualung with an additional massive balloon with compressed air.  When the valve was opened and the air was blown out of the nozzle, a reactive effect arose, which allowed Agent 007 to move rather quickly under water.  The speed and duration of the work is unknown. <br><br><h1>  You only live twice, 1967 </h1><br>  <b>Device to determine the combination of safe locks</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ef0/cc9/3d3/ef0cc93d3b2346bfb4bf03b10c17004e.jpg"><br><br>  The dream of a bear cub.  When you rotate the dial, the lights on the device light up.  If you click on them, the device gives the corresponding numeric combination.  Of course, it would be better to immediately give the necessary numbers, without an intermediate stage with light bulbs, but that would be too easy and not so cool. <br><br><h1>  Diamonds are forever, 1971 </h1><br>  <b>Voice changer</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/3e0/9ce/589/3e09ce589473442488cfdb2924142f64.jpg"><br><br>  This tape recorder with additional features allowed you to modify the sound of the voice so that it becomes like the voice of another person.  Pay attention to this touching font on the block of light bulbs. <br><br>  <b>Floating balloon</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/255/a9f/f94/255a9ff94af940ba9d0c4e033aee1026.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/5fe/bcf/89e/5febcf89ee6c4247aebb1e8a57ca7e5f.jpg"><br><br>  The basis of this device is an interesting idea.  Bond was dropped inside this ball from an airplane near the oil rig, where the sneaky enemy sat down, and then ... walked inside the ball through the water, like a dry land.  When he reached the place, he unzipped the zipper, got out and won all. <br><br><h1>  Live and let die (Live and let die), 1973 </h1><br>  <b>Electronic wrist watches</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/32f/690/274/32f690274fcd47e4bae61b74366d09e4.jpg"><br><br>  Now ordinary electronic watches look like a primitive device, and more than 40 years ago it was an accessory for those who are at the forefront of technological progress. <br><br>  <b>Electromagnetic Wrist Watch</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/931/c55/b62/931c55b62a1144279a77722bd1135d4a.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/344/3b3/a0d/3443b3a0dd33415eb5be11084aaeddc0.jpg"><br><br>  Rolex has once again appeared on Bond's hand.  This time, the clock was a mega-gadget: when the button was pressed, such a strong electromagnetic field was generated that they could repel flying bullets.  Or attract steel objects to yourself.  But this was not enough for the authors: the clock could also be turned into a small circular saw! <br><br>  <b>Cigarette lighter radio transmitter</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/95b/5e8/b2b/95b5e8b2b680417ca2fb5f4a01986f4d.jpg"><br><br>  In Bond's car, a radio transmitter was hidden under the guise of an innocuous cigarette lighter.  Details history is silent. <br><br>  <b>Bug Detector</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/87a/334/937/87a334937d3d45f79395088b8bf47adc.jpg"><br><br>  New detector model "bugs", this time to search for them in the whole room.  The design has undergone significant changes compared with the previous detector. <br><br>  <b>Radio transmitter</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/3a3/935/944/3a39359447464e1992f794fd35225736.jpg"><br><br>  Another fancy idea: a small radio transmitter was built into the hairbrush.  It looks pretty ridiculous, especially in combination with the cigarette lighter. <br><br>  <b>Pistol shooting compressed air bullets</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/bde/768/a0e/bde768a0e6b6454f98f7b95ea78f5134.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c36/067/c0d/c36067c0d13748e599c5d2176b4295db.jpg"><br><br>  Initially, this device was designed to fight sharks, while Bond gets to the destination.  However, then Agent 007 completely wildly kills the villain during an underwater struggle: he forces him to swallow a bullet with compressed air, due to which he swells up (!) And bursts (!!).  What then will Bond say: "He always had a swollen conceit."  Good black humor. <br><br><h1>  The man with the golden gun, 1974 </h1><br>  <b>Sunlight converter (Solex agitator)</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/cfc/dde/230/cfcdde230fe54c468d800ff0f566f4b4.jpg"><br><br>  This device was necessary for the process of converting sunlight into electricity.  Do not ask how.  The technology was developed by a British scientist (s). <br><br><h1>  The spy who loved me (The spy who loved me), 1977 </h1><br>  <b>Clock with integrated telegraph</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e24/215/a0a/e24215a0aea04c8abcf9d5412e321b1e.jpg"><br><br>  It was impossible to surprise the viewer with an electronic clock.  It required something new, unusual.  As a result, Bond's new watch was equipped with a device that prints text messages received via radio. <br><br>  <b>The device for viewing microfilm</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/dd8/df3/abe/dd8df3abe6fa4f388dda96723dba112d.jpg"><br><br>  In the past century, microfilms were very popular in the espionage environment.  They were a fine-grained film, which was filmed with special cameras with a very small frame size.  This made it possible to accommodate a large amount of visual information per unit of film area.  Naturally, to view tiny frames, you had to use a magnifying glass.  Bond just turned out to be a similar adaptation, assembled from a cigarette pack and a lighter. <br><br><h1>  Moonraker, 1979 </h1><br>  <b>Mini Drot Shooting Device</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c33/3fb/ab3/c333fbab3e6947049b168fdf04f6fe4b.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/dac/58f/a39/dac58fa3955c4b8c85fd04c9710e8b9c.jpg"><br><br>  It was worn like a wrist watch.  A shot was made thanks to the registration of nerve impulses, when Bond bent his arm in the wrist.  There were two kinds of darts: ordinary and with cyanide.  Very cute gadget. <br><br>  <b>Exploding wrist watch</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/006/59e/c9f/00659ec9f6e441b39ecad640fbd74056.jpg"><br><br>  Simple and straightforward: the lower part contains compressed explosive disc.  If you really need, you can blow up something small. <br><br>  <b>Mini-camera</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/499/c5e/268/499c5e2681fb4c92b17313c42ec96c8c.jpg"><br><br>  A tiny camera that shoots on a narrow film. <br><br>  <b>Another device for determining combinations of safe locks</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/bd1/5d5/3c7/bd15d53c7e644c95a927e0fb34fe9fcb.jpg"><br><br>  More advanced and compact model that fits in a pack of cigarettes.  The device uses X-rays to scan the safe lock. <br><br><h1>  For your eyes only, 1981 </h1><br>  <b>3D ID (3D Identigraph)</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/2a9/107/f20/2a9107f20a23481a90332163ea9bfe15.jpg"><br><br>  According to the plot, this is an experimental device in which you can add signs of the right person, but it is looking for coincidences in the databases of the special services of several countries of the world.  When it finds it, it prints the ‚Äúportrait‚Äù of the wanted person.  The richness of the graphics and the potential effectiveness of the device can be estimated from the screenshot. <br><br>  <b>Hybrid Clock Radio</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/14d/6a0/328/14d6a0328aa94e74b516f05bbfe03de1.jpg"><br><br>  This watch displayed the time both by the hands and on the luminous LCD display.  But the trick was different: a radio transmitter for voice communication was built into the gadget.  This is already quite a modern approach to compactness. <br><br><h1>  Octopussy, 1983 </h1><br>  <b>Watch with tracker</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c7d/40f/889/c7d40f88995341e395c29bb87cd598e8.jpg"><br><br>  This time, a tracker was built into the electronic clock of an unusual design that allows you to track the movement of "beacons".  Great progress, but earlier for this, the device had to be built into the panel of the car.  By the way, the "lighthouses" themselves also greatly decreased in size, now they have to be installed using tweezers. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/def/fee/99e/deffee99e610437a8f0b970e28016032.jpg"><br><br>  <b>Acid handle</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c4c/210/9d0/c4c2109d04b140ecbad28121e3cb26a9.jpg"><br><br>  Fountain pen with gold pen, filled not with ink, but with a mixture of concentrated nitric and hydrochloric acids.  This hellish gadget was intended for dissolving metal objects.  For example, to escape from captivity. <br><br>  <b>Watch with color LCD screen</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/69b/be6/9fd/69bbe69fd6ae4fc6a173629ca0b90d63.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/56e/426/6f8/56e4266f88384255b8a4c4bab4f3374c.jpg"><br><br>  This is already a conversation, this is a real breakthrough!  It is a modern approach to miniaturization (and the choice of content).  The image of miniature cameras was transmitted to Bond on this watch. <br><br><h1>  Kind view (A view to a kill), 1985 </h1><br>  <b>Microchip detector</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a94/475/249/a944752495b340d980fa5a5b629093dc.jpg"><br><br>  The gadget was used to search for a microchip buried under snow.  The principle of operation of the device was based on the fact that microchips have an increased electrical resistance. <br><br>  <b>Electric Shaver Detector</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f64/d17/5a9/f64d175a99c84d4ba6e6451203f23e48.jpg"><br><br>  From the point of view of miniature - step back.  Could at least put a detector in the lighter, after the color TV in the clock. <br><br>  <b>Polarized Sunglasses</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/bcb/c9b/694/bcbc9b6941984289958967abc4eb6e7a.jpg"><br><br>  Thanks to the rotation of the filters embedded in the glasses, Bond was able to see what was happening behind the tinted glass in the window of the house.  Very doubtful in terms of optics solution. <br><br>  <b>Ring Camera</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/414/31e/899/41431e8998b2439f82dda5302ff8791c.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e92/300/da5/e92300da505f49419f26356fcd59cb70.jpg"><br><br>  Here is such a superminiature spy gadget.  It would be interesting to see the process of charging the film. <br><br>  <b>Robot observer</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e96/1ad/e15/e961ade15a5948d9920824481a120532.jpg"><br><br>  The radio-controlled car equipped with a video camera and rotary "head".  The design is very similar to the humanoid robots, what they saw in the sixties. <br><br><h1>  Sparks from the eyes (The living daylights), 1987 </h1><br>  <b>Multifunctional Keychain</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/6ba/e2e/5bd/6bae2e5bd3d94e4d88ab61451a098c3e.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/431/f48/79b/431f4879bc7f4d7dafe1e472ac85422f.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e71/eeb/dab/e71eebdab267428d86373b2c47fa6917.jpg"><br><br>  First, if the key combination of sounds were whistled at the keyring, it could release a portion of the gas that had disoriented the breathing person for half a minute.  Also on the key fob was a super-lump, which opens 90% of the locks in the world.  As a result, Bond hitched a key chain to the statue on a magnet, howled like a wolf, and the key ring exploded. <br><br><h1>  License to kill (License to kill), 1989 </h1><br>  <b>Laser camera</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/cc9/9b4/e30/cc99b4e30c1c47cc8fe0f9c651d40d9c.jpg"><br><br>  This gadget was not used by Bond, but it is impossible not to tell about it.  This is a modified Polaroid camera with built-in combat laser.  At that time there were no laser pointers available to everyone, so the idea was fresh and closely echoed the fantastic blasters. <br><br><h1>  Golden Eye, 1995 </h1><br>  <b>Ratchet Gun with Laser Module</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/9d3/b1d/df1/9d3b1ddf159848f598048e4f763086ea.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/0de/f2c/e97/0def2ce97717411ab0e9abe1ec171cab.jpg"><br><br>  Behind such a long and ornate definition is a device that allows you to shoot with force a small hook anchor with a rope, thereby driving it into stone and concrete.  Then you could safely go down a steep wall.  And in which case, cut a hole in the right place with a laser beam.  But it would seem that already in the year of 1995 ... <br><br>  <b>Device for breaking combination locks</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e83/07c/4f3/e8307c4f3ecd4097943391cdd2040efc.jpg"><br><br>  It was very simple to use it: it is enough to place it on top of a combination lock, as in a few seconds it gives the necessary opening code.  Ideally, unlike the gadget for opening safes. <br><br>  <b>Miniature camera with wireless communication module</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e98/435/97b/e9843597bed84765b4f2195e5db34132.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/05d/631/cdd/05d631cddcaf45389bed4e5b97795ac2.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/8ce/3b2/be9/8ce3b2be9da14d6586b6b225dac74473.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/7c4/f4b/c42/7c4f4bc42d1040aabf5925c30caf5aa8.jpg"><br><br>  This small digital camera was equipped with a zoom and made it possible to send the captured images using the wireless module.  By the way, the car stereo could print these photos with explanatory information.  And at a frequency of 87.5 FM analysts broadcast to Bond their comments on the content of photos. <br><br>  <b>Dulfer belt</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/cfc/8c4/393/cfc8c4393cb246f49b0497a980ee9010.jpg"><br><br>  The thinnest line-rope and hook, which could be shot at the ceiling and go down on the belt, were built into the usual belt.  We hardly ever know about the wonderful way to shoot and drive tiny hooks into concrete and stone, as well as about the technology of creating the finest ropes that can withstand a healthy twitching peasant. <br><br><h1>  Tomorrow never dies, 1997 </h1><br>  <b>Miniature wireless camera</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ee8/2ca/fd7/ee82cafd722d4a839f71642a2493ab4d.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c8b/017/51a/c8b01751ab5b43bba72aee83aca27197.jpg"><br><br>  This small camera could transmit video directly to MI-6 headquarters.  In 1997, when wide sections of the population used pagers with might and main, it was a cool technology. <br><br>  <b>Super Advanced Cell Phone</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/4ad/a3e/5c6/4ada3e5c6bb64eaba315c39fd11638ba.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/430/057/8df/4300578df540464fb406fb48019f2b75.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/9ff/0be/510/9ff0be51084d4977872f174e027ad2dc.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/284/1fd/cf8/2841fdcf80a9479b8cec19dd0bb5a203.jpg"><br><br>  Well, right not mobile, but a Swiss knife in the world of electronics.  Yes, and with this design.  It had a built-in fingerprint scanner that allows you to fool security systems.  Even Bond could manage his car right from the phone.  In addition, the phone could be used to break locks.  And finally, it had a built-in stun gun that gave out 2000 volts.  And all this beauty in 1997. <br><br>  <b>GPS module</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/4de/d43/7d7/4ded437d74ce46e58796b28266282954.jpg"><br><br>  This is now a GPS smartphone in every pocket.  And then it was a top-secret device capable of transmitting and receiving signals from GPS satellites to control the ships. <br><br>  <b>Duplex bracelet</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/386/d60/e18/386d60e1840342768509fc5191ec2143.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/22c/fe3/7a2/22cfe37a2b484493be6ee7b7a782662e.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/760/5cb/10b/7605cb10b79746878f4e6832df13ebb1.jpg"><br><br>  A rather simple device, acting in the same way as the other gadgets mentioned for the rappelling: the hook is shot at a suitable object, driven into it - and it‚Äôs ready, you can go down on the rope, uiiiiii! <br><br><h1>  And the world is not enough (The world is not enough), 1999 </h1><br>  <b>X-ray glasses</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a88/9bd/4b0/a889bd4b0d634dd7a85a0c066da993c6.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b84/582/47c/b8458247cfd4493e96a812f65c595e25.jpg"><br><br>  But not only Soviet children dreamed of unrealizable!  The kids grew up and realized their dreams at a new technological level.  In this film, Bond got X-ray glasses that let you see what people have under their clothes. <br><br>  <b>Inflatable Jacket Sphere</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/bc2/ec9/a23/bc2ec9a236874faf80c0d9c0b1193273.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/cc1/76e/216/cc176e2165fa437ea4f6e3683c61747f.jpg"><br><br>  A plain-looking jacket can instantly inflate and turn into a sphere protecting Bond from the miseries of the outside world. <br><br>  <b>Credit card pick</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/31e/6a6/ed4/31e6a6ed40a942a1a9823f514635d23b.jpg"><br><br>  This is also a tool rather than a gadget.  Now you can easily buy sets of master keys, laser-cut in a steel plate the size of a credit card.  But the point here is that the master key is hidden inside the credit card.  Although the conspicuous junction of parts of the card ruins the whole idea of ‚Äã‚Äãa secret tool. <br><br><h1>  Die, but not now (Die another day), 2002 </h1><br>  <b>Knife with integrated satellite beacon</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/0fe/709/cc1/0fe709cc14e64a1885341d025e91dd8d.jpg"><br><br>  A miniature folding antenna and a transmitter capable of finishing off to a GPS satellite were built into the handle of an ordinary military knife.  Low power for such a narrow signal. <br><br>  <b>Virtual reality simulator</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/5d3/478/d40/5d3478d40ace4906ba563c88b9255857.jpg"><br><br>  Although not a gadget, but a large stationary installation, but it is impossible not to mention this.  Still, a virtual reality simulator, this is not going down the line.  By the way, the simulator was used to trap the villains who believed in the reality of what they see. <br><br>  <b>Sound ring</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e6a/d03/fbd/e6ad03fbdc4b4a7fa6e36255ea6fcf24.jpg"><br><br>  A wonderful gadget that allows you to break even bulletproof glass with a powerful ultrasound pulse.  Let it be so, but the question is different: why doesn‚Äôt it tear apart the carrier of the ring itself? <br><br>  <b>Invisible Machine</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/acf/846/ec5/acf846ec5b864e6987f497d56c6c09c7.jpg"><br><br>  Car covered with so-called adaptive camouflage.    ,    ,       . ,    ? <br><br><h1>   (Casino Royale), 2006 </h1><br> <b>   </b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d33/77b/337/d3377b337b7845edaf657594d700f49f.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/bc0/593/40f/bc059340fb8c432682a790087c6921b8.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d9d/c63/393/d9dc63393b194f9db0a373669679c573.jpg"><br><br>          ,    :  , ,  ,   ..  ,         ,       .        . <br><br><h1>   (Quantum of solace), 2008 </h1><br> <b>     </b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/827/2dc/44e/8272dc44edb3492699a82b401a7d4967.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/55b/0b0/e80/55b0b0e8035545849505be304b5f2f0a.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ee6/470/911/ee64709110314740b6142e9308b3e624.jpg"><br><br>        .   ,     ,          ‚Äî    ,    : ¬´¬ª ,  ,      .. <br><br> <b> </b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/778/b1c/e92/778b1ce920044657b1465d81cb3b2e47.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/6ae/e66/353/6aee663532e94bcdbdbeb0beaa537149.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/cc8/9b0/c71/cc89b0c71bd0404e8d8f6a8c25fa8645.jpg"><br><br>    ,   .        ,                  .           . <br><br>  * * * <br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">This concludes our review, which turned out to be extremely voluminous. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Here we have included the overwhelming majority of gadgets used by Agent 007.
