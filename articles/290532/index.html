  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How we blogged on 5 platforms and what we got from it</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Hi, Megamind!  For more than a month now, we have been running our blog on Megamind, a little earlier, we also led it on other platforms.  Today we would like to share the information received and see if it was worth it.  Well, at the same time find out where the most effective start-up companies to keep your blog. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/6fd/9a1/351/6fd9a13517254a7eb5fdbc1f79220016.jpg" alt="image"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  Blog on RusBase </h4><br>  Now RusBase is completely changed, so the <a href="http://rusbase.vc/blogs/">‚ÄúBlogs‚Äù</a> section gives out 404, although the old materials remained in place.  In general, the functionality of adding and editing articles or describing a company was not the most convenient there, it remains so to this day.  It is not known whether blogs will appear in the future.  Attendance of the relevant section also left much to be desired.  In general, RusBase at one time gave us 22 transitions. <br><br><h4>  Cossa blog </h4><br>  As you may know, Cossa allows you to run your blog, from where all the articles fall into the sandbox.  No pre-moderation - articles immediately appear on the site.  From the pros: on the main side there is a block with the latest materials from the sandbox, so all visitors see the headlines.  Sometimes popular articles are placed on the main tape, which gives additional traffic.  This has not happened to us.  Of the minuses: a completely uncomfortable admin panel and it takes a long time to fill in and format everything as it should.  Attendance section leaves much to be desired.  Cossa gave us 3 months 101 transition:

For 3 months (from February 1 to May 1), the blog gave 141 visits.  Not as much as we would like, but we didn‚Äôt advertise it anywhere, and published all valuable content on third-party resources.  That was the content strategy.  We didn‚Äôt have viral materials, maybe for this reason, the blog didn‚Äôt make much headway - no matter what we published, people just didn‚Äôt know about the existence of a blog, and therefore there was some useful information there.  Now we are trying to gradually attract people there. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/5f5/308/6e8/5f53086e841946b697eeda2b07dd1209.jpg" alt="image"></div><br><br><h4>  Spark.ru blog </h4><br>  Spark.ru is the third project of the ‚ÄúCommittee‚Äù after ‚ÄúZuckerberg Call‚Äù and TJ.  We have already written about him here.  Gave us 815 transitions.  Of the benefits: a comfortable admin, good traffic.  Of the minuses: the dominance of bots and materials of the BuzzFead format and Adme like ‚Äú10 gifs that will change your life‚Äù, ‚Äú25 secrets to make successful success‚Äù.  An incomprehensible rating calculation system and, more recently, an even more incomprehensible policy of the appearance of materials in the tape.  For 3 months Spark gave us 815 transitions. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/831/0c7/ac3/8310c7ac34f8497d980abc5dba0791c8.jpg" alt="image"></div><br><br><h4>  Megamozg Blog </h4><br>  Well, the most delicious.  We have to admit that for a long time they did not dare to go here, because they were afraid of being mined - the Habr audience is known as the most sophisticated, and therefore it was necessary to carefully prepare the content so as not to lose face.  We probably studied the materials from the ‚ÄúBest‚Äù section for a month in order to understand how to write for the Megamind.  It turned out or not - difficult to understand.  Anyway, in just 1 month, Megamind gave us more than 1,300 clicks to the site, i.e.  more than all other platforms combined in 3 months: <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b57/fe9/fec/b57fe9fec611421f869a490eec6eb3be.jpg" alt="image"></div><br><br><h4>  Did not take off </h4><br>  We once tried to blog at Megaindex, Delovoymir, CNews, Shopolog, Salesman.ru and Sostav.  But it turned out that, firstly, there is an uncomfortable admin panel, secondly, long pre-moderation, thirdly, low attendance in the ‚ÄúBlogs‚Äù section, fourthly, we just didn‚Äôt decide what to write there.  Together, they gave us about 100 transitions and about 10 registrations.  We decided to leave work with them until better times. <br><br><h4>  From personal observations </h4><br>  A blog as a tool to attract traffic is very useful for any project, whether it is a startup or not.  This is especially necessary when the project was just born and no one yet knows about it.  We here with the help of blogs were able to attract the first traffic and declare themselves.  Often the blog brings more transitions to the site than the same direct.  We have, for example, all that way.  Another question is what percentage of these visits comes to pay or at least leads.  We manually calculated the number of registrations from each platform. <br><br><blockquote>  Most registrations in 1 month gave us Megamind - 122. Of these, 67 turned into payments. </blockquote><br>  PS Soon we will go to Habr, where we will publish a completely different content, more related to the technical component.  So far, we are also preparing content and looking around, so that we are not showered with tomatoes immediately from the threshold. <br><br>  We have it all. <br>  Thank you for reading us! <br>  Subscribe to our <a href="http://megamozg.ru/company/rocketcallback/">blog</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/290532/">https://habr.com/ru/post/290532/</a></p>
