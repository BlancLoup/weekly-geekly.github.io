Included in the top 50 contributors Ruby on Rails, maintainer Sprockets.  The creator of the libraries Wicked and Derailed Benchmarks, works on Heroku and is engaged in the service codetriage.co, which helps people start their journey into the world of open source. <br><br>  <b>Threads Aren't Evil</b> <br><br>  Okay, so threads are pretty evil.  But they are not necessary to work with.  In this talk we‚Äôll look at some real world Ruby libraries where threads were applied to otherwise otherwise impossible tasks.  We will look for support for parallelism by the flow of threads for performance gains.  If you are not comfortable with the "" T "" <br><br>  <b>Piotr Solnica</b> , a developer from Poland, works as a technical company in Icelab.  Author rom-rb and dry-rb, active OSS contributor.  The report will be about <b>Rom-rb 4.0</b> , while we are clarifying the details! <br><br><br>  <b>Nick Sutterer</b> by Trailblazer!  Wherever there is a serious and deep debate about the architecture of software in open source, if there is a free beer there, Nick Satterer is most likely somewhere nearby.  Say hi to him, he loves people. <br><br>  <b>Ruby is dead</b> <br><br>  Having a simple programming language.  Give them those!  We can have some nice things in Ruby. <br><br>  <b>Luca Guidi</b> , family man, independent OSS developer, author of the Hanami framework.  Topic: <b>Functional web with Ruby</b> , details will tell later. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/2d6/8e4/791/2d68e47912c945f91aa01614b35bd18e.png" alt="image"><br>  <b>Kir Shatrov</b> , Production Engineer from Shopify. <br><br>  <b>Background Tasks Framework Architecture</b> <br><br>  Probably every Ruby developer used a task queue and Sidekiq.  However, in a complex project, background tasks are much more than just a queue: these are priority lines, limited resources, ‚Äúunique‚Äù tasks and batching into task groups. <br><br>  How to ensure a ‚Äúfair‚Äù queue on the occasion when one client added a million tasks and another just one?  What happens to tasks when we want to stop the worker after rolling out a new version of the application?  What to do with tasks that go through all the records in the database and take a week?  The report will talk about what is hidden under the hood of all these features - and how some of them are implemented by Sidekiq (Pro).  After listening to the report, these features will cease to be magic for you and become ordinary data structures. <br><br>  <b>Anton Davydov</b> , developer, enthusiast of Open source, Hanami core. <br><br>  <b>What we should build an ecosystem</b> <br><br>  Two years ago, while working on Hanami, I did not realize how important the ecosystem was for the project.  Every day in our work we use the most modern technologies: languages, frameworks, plug-ins and other products.  We do not think about how much time we save thanks to a developed ecosystem and ready-made solutions to common problems. <br><br>  For example, many people like Rails for the opportunity to create MVP as soon as possible.  This is not only the merit of the framework: there is a whole system of gems around Rails, and the solutions of most tasks have already been described.  Therefore, a developed ecosystem is important for a product that will be easy and comfortable to use. <br><br>  I will share the Hanami ecosystem creation experience.  I will tell you how technology develops thanks to its environment, what rake we stepped on in the process, and why would I start developing an ecosystem if I returned 2 years ago. <br><br><br>  <b>Andrey Molchanov</b> , Software Developer in Evrone. <br><br>  <b>Ruby's Virtual Machine</b> <br><br>  Consider what place a virtual machine takes in the compilation of a program and what is it for.  We find out what the virtual machine was in its first version, analyze its shortcomings as the reasons for further changes. <br><br>  Taking into account the current implementation, we will go the way of compiling the program to the machine code, having examined in detail what is happening inside it. <br><br>  In conclusion, we will discuss where this project is moving, what it wants to improve and in what way. <br><br>  <b>Vladimir Dementiev</b> , a developer in Evil Martians, a mathematician, an open source developer <br><br>  <b>Tests should be quick too.</b> <br><br>  Tests occupy an important part of development, especially on Ruby and Rails.  As a rule, we pay little attention to the organization of test code and their optimization.  Until we notice that we spend too much time to see the green color at the end of the tunnel. <br><br>  I want to talk about how to detect problem areas in tests, show ways to eliminate them, and also introduce a new tool that will help you with this - TestProf. <br><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/18d/620/160/18d6201606f6cdb22891337c5281266b.png" alt="image"><br>  <b>Anna Shcherbinina</b> , leader in the Artec3D web department. <br><br>  <b>Tale of synchronous and asynchronous paradigms</b> <br><br>  Web is based on communication: interaction between services, servers, utilities, classes in the application.  Initially, two polarities stand out, synchronous interaction between components and asynchronous.  Obviously, synchronous interaction is indispensable when the reaction is directly related to the response received to the request.  With asynchronous requests is also quite simple, it doesn‚Äôt matter to us when they are executed, as long as they are executed. <br><br>  Later, hybrids appeared that are semantically synchronous, and asynchronous in the implementation.  As an example - the well-known long-pulling.  For asynchronous, the time over which they should work is often indicated.  It happens that you need to answer several clients, instead of one. <br><br>  Each of the types has its own characteristics, strengths and weaknesses, which we consider. <br>  But what if you look at synchronicity and asynchrony from a different angle? <br><br>  <b>Nikita Shilnikov</b> , Dry-rb and Rom-rb Core developer. <br><br>  <b>We solve problems like</b> <br><br>  Ruby is a dynamically typed language, but this does not mean that there are types in it.  Sometimes we want more predictability and evidence from the code, but we do not have the tools for this in the language itself.  It will be about dry-types gem - one of the main dependencies of dry-validation and ROM. <br><br><br>  <b>Nikita Sobolev</b> , wemake.services, organizer elixir-lang.moscow and ambassador Auth0 <br><br>  <b>Elixir is not Ruby, but rather</b> <br><br>  One of the creators of Rails, Jose Valim, created his own programming language.  So different, but so familiar!  Of course, he was inspired by Ruby when he created it.  And many began to consider the language Elixir - new Ruby.  And there was a problem.  Languages ‚Äã‚Äãare fundamentally different.  And a lack of understanding of the differences in approaches and principles has destroyed more than one project.  I propose to understand what kind of new ideas we are offered?  What is the philosophy of Elixir and "Phoenix-way"? <br><br>  That's not all, we will publish the rest of the program very soon!  And if you have something to tell the community, it‚Äôs not too late to write to elena@evrone.ru with the topic ‚ÄúI want to speak‚Äù. <br><br>  While we are all waiting for the conference, you can watch videos from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist%3Flist%3DPLiWUIs1hSNeOXZhotgDX7Y7qBsr24cu7o">RailsClub 2016</a> and the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3D5CiC0MJbAGg%26list%3DPLiWUIs1hSNeOA6D8CynSFIAk6YJpEJSH5">summer Ruby-mitap</a> .
