The project was launched with the support of a partner, a non-profit organization Innovate Finance.  The goal of the project is to explore the additional capabilities of the blockchain technology using significant computational and analytical capabilities of the company.

      Now the partners are already quite far advanced in the project, so it was decided to launch the first services based on this technology.  It is worth recalling here that <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A6%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BF%25D0%25BE%25D1%2587%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B0_%25D0%25B1%25D0%25BB%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BA%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2_%25D1%2582%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B7%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BA%25D1%2586%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B9">blockchain networks</a> are based on the concept of decentralized control, however some cloud environments retain a vulnerability that allows for hacking of information systems and unauthorized access.  The IBM team, consisting of information security experts, cryptographers, hardware experts and researchers, has created groundbreaking cloud services for robust, trusted networks based on blockchain technology. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Services of this type help create and manage blockchain networks.  This is necessary to ensure reliable operation of the new class of distributed financial applications.  Now developers can create digital assets and corresponding business logic, which will open up the possibility for a more secure and confidential transfer of assets between participants of the blockchain test network with limited and protected access rights.  Using new services from IBM, available on Bluemix, developers can use fully integrated DevOps tools to create, deploy, run and monitor blockchain applications on the IBM Cloud.  Applications of this type can also be deployed on <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/ibm/blog/279571/">IBM z Systems</a> , providing an additional level of security for especially valuable data.  Blockchain applications can access existing systems on <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/ibm/blog/279571/">Z Systems</a> distributed servers and computers through an API, thus supporting new types of payment, transaction, procurement and business management procedures. <br><br>  Among other features, we will highlight the connection of IoT data to the blockchain.  Using the Watson IoT Platform, IBM allows you to use such types of information as device positioning coordinates using radio modules, readable bar codes, or device data.  In the near future, IoT gadgets will be able to work with distributed blockchain logs to update and view contact data.  For example, the location and temperature of the package using this technology will be automatically recorded and recorded in the blockchain.  At the same time, all parties related to the package will be able to receive an update of its status. <br><br>  In order to introduce developers to the new product, our company conducts the so-called IBM Garages for blockchain developers.  What it is?  <b>IBM Garages</b> , one might say, is a service station that is already open or will be implemented in major cities in the near future.  IBM Global Business Services also plans to extend blockchain counseling services to clients in the financial and banking sectors, plus logistics.  It is planned to start working with IBM Interactive Experience (IBM iX) in the development of implementation options for the blockchain in more than 25 IBM studios around the world (IBM Studios). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ad1/ea0/a80/ad1ea0a80e739eb32338ff1ae3fd48c4.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Creating new services, the company pays a lot of attention to the security of both these services and users.  ‚ÄúOur customers consider security issues as one of the factors that slows down the implementation of the blockchain.  Today, there is a general understanding of the need for rapid implementation of the blockchain technology in enterprises.  At the same time, many organizations need help in choosing the perfect cloud environment that will allow you to safely manage the blockchain in the cloud, ‚Äùsaid Jerry Cuomo, vice president of IBM Blockchain. <br><br>  In this area, solving the problem of information security is provided in several ways.  They include cloud services that meet the highest standards in this area (FIPS 140-2 and EAL), which provides support for the blockchain in the healthcare, public and financial sectors.  Recall that we passed about 44,000 lines of code to the open <a href="https://www.hyperledger.org/">project Hyperledger of</a> the Linux Foundation consortium.  In addition, the source code is also posted on <a href="https://github.com/openblockchain">GitHub</a> .  This made it possible to simplify the use of IBM Hyperledger project code by the Linux Foundation consortium in any environment.  In addition to this, our company offers services based on Bluemix - a cloud platform that helps developers to quickly create applications. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/IgNfoQQ5Reg%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700019,15700186,15700190,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhgrtCqPvCBUl3BpgG5yWbHBqJarTA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  Thanks to the IBM Garage opened in April in New York, the company actively collaborates with customers such as BNY Mellon to accelerate the design and development of a unique application for securities loans using blockchain for selling and transferring assets. <br><br>  <b>Choosing a security scheme for a blockchain in the cloud</b> <br><br>  The IBM Cloud enables enterprises to quickly create secure, crack-resistant networks with thousands of users.  The cloud platform will help you create and deploy a blockchain in minutes, using registered, certified and verified Docker images along with a dashboard, analytics and support. <br><br>  The new cloud services have been optimized for blockchains located in the cloud network, thanks to a verifiable operating environment with comprehensive registration data that complies with technical expertise and regulatory requirements.  Hacking-resistant cipher key storage and full security of the cryptographic module allow detecting and responding to unauthorized physical access attempts.  In addition, IBM Cloud services allow blockchain partners to operate in a secure environment that prevents information leaks from shared storage devices and hardware. <br><br>  ‚ÄúBlockchain is an incredibly innovative and promising technology.  However, there are still many challenges that businesses need to resolve, ‚Äùsaid Agey Yuki, director and executive vice president of NTT DATA.  - IBM's new cloud blockchain service is just trying to resolve such issues.  We believe that it will help accelerate the emergence of blockchain technology. ‚Äù <br><br>  <b>IBM Blockchain for Hyperledger is now available on DockerHub</b> <br><br>  For organizations that need the flexibility to run blockchain environments on different cloud servers or devices, a signed and certified distribution of IBM code for the DockerHub Hyperledger project has become available.  Current updates will provide new features, such as dashboards, analytic services, online chat support and exclusive networking services. <br><br>  <b>IBM Blockchain services for the Bluemix platform offer developers more flexibility</b> <br><br>  For application developers who want to instantly launch and run the blockchain environment and start building applications, IBM Blockchain beta services on the Bluemix platform will provide access to the latest version of Linux Hyperledger code with current updates.  Regardless of the platform, DockerHub or IBM Cloud, IBM Blockchain supports many usage scenarios for a wide variety of tasks and industries. <br><br>  <b>How to take part in the project?</b> <br><br>  Our projects are open to new members!  <a href="http://www.ibm.com/blockchain">You can get acquainted</a> with the latest blockchain technologies in the framework of the hackathon Consensus Building Blocks Hackathon 2016, where developers using IBM Blockchain services will create innovative applications on the Bluemix platform using IBM Watson, IBM Internet of Things technologies, Weather Channel data, etc. Elections , risk management, finance, healthcare, insurance, the supply system and the Internet of things are examples of areas that are already ready for transformation by introducing blockchain networks. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/302222/">https://habr.com/ru/post/302222/</a></p>
