The proliferation of online consulting systems is approaching a state of dynamic equilibrium.  Every day there are several hundreds of new sites that are starting to use an online consultant, but about the same number of sites with already established chat disappears.  In this case, the main reason is not that business owners have become disillusioned with this method of communication with customers, but that companies no longer see themselves on the Internet market and cease to exist. <br><br><br clear="all"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/137/7bf/62f/1377bf62ff7c4501bb0c6a915bd9db28.png"><br>  <i>Growth chart for paid clients of the RedHelper online consultant</i> <a name="habracut"></a>

      Previously, we predicted that the rapid spread of online consultants will last 2.5 - 3 years, i.e.  until about the middle of 2017. But already at the beginning of the year, this area of ‚Äã‚Äãbusiness reached the ‚Äúplateau‚Äù.  At the same time - about a year ago - during the growing crisis, callback systems became popular.  It turned out that a simple button labeled ‚ÄúCall back in 30 seconds‚Äù is really able to add new customers.  And even large companies, regardless of their clumsiness and bureaucracy, were able to quickly navigate and turn on these systems. <br><br>  Throughout this tough year, callback systems are actively capturing the market at ever increasing speed.  Despite its modest size, this small business area is growing rapidly even in difficult times. <br><br>  And now not everyone understands what tool is better and in what conditions it should be used. <br><br><h2>  What will the client choose - chat or call? </h2><br>  A very frequent question from our customers - which is better?  Chat or call? <br><br>  Having broken the sites of our clients into categories and reviewing the statistics, a very interesting pattern became apparent. <br><br>  On sites where customers in most cases can accurately formulate their question (and you can answer it just as clearly and quickly), chat will be more popular.  If the client has difficulty in formulating the question, or does not even know what specifically to ask, then the call is more effective. <br><br>  A few examples.  Take the financial business - brokerage services, credit histories, trading.  In these areas, the client is never completely sure that he asked all the necessary questions - he needs extensive advice, which is very difficult to provide through the chat.  So, to convince a visitor to become a client in this area is much easier by phone. <br><br>  At the same time, if an entrepreneur deals with goods of regular demand (for example, a flower shop), chat will be more effective.  Most likely, customers will be interested in two or three small details - delivery schedule, payment terms, bouquet size, etc.  All these questions can be answered quickly in the chat, especially since the operator can use pre-prepared phrases (so-called ‚Äúquick answers‚Äù). <br><br>  In general, the probability of buying through an online consultant is somewhat higher, since  when contacting the chat client knows exactly what he wants - and only clarifies some points.  For comparison with a real store, you can imagine those customers who immediately go to the shelf, take the goods and go to the checkout as chat users.  And those who agree to the dialogue after the phrase ‚ÄúCan I help you with anything?‚Äù Are more likely to prefer a call. <br><br>  This, of course, is a very rough generalization, and exceptions to this rule are not uncommon.  In the end, a lot depends on your Internet site and its specificity. <br><br>  I can not fail to notice that in reality there are no websites where there is only one category of clients.  The whole point in their relationship.  There will always be those who can not clearly formulate a question, even if we are talking about an ordinary shovel, and they will need advice by phone.  On the other hand, a client who is well versed in the product can always come to your website, who only needs to know whether it is in stock or, for example, the color of the goods ‚Äî this is more convenient to do via chat. <br><br>  At the same time, there is a whole category of ‚Äúborder zone‚Äù sites, where the ratio of visitors is about the same ‚Äî for example, the auto business or real estate. <br><br><h2>  Development of communication tools in the near future. </h2><br>  If we take the whole market of goods and services, the number of users who have the opportunity to formulate their own question, and the number of customers who have difficulty in understanding what they want is about the same.  Therefore, we predict that the callback market will reach the equivalent online distribution consultancy system throughout the year.  As for the chat rooms themselves, it is now difficult to expect their growth, most likely this market will be in stagnation over the next 18-24 months. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/297662/">https://habr.com/ru/post/297662/</a></p>
