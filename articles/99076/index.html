My name is Alexander Lozhechkin, I work as the head of the department of strategic technologies in the Russian representation of Microsoft.  We call the Department of Strategic Technologies in Russian what is originally in English called the Department of Developers &amp; Platform Evangelism. <br><br>  I came to Microsoft a little more than six years ago, starting work in the same department, which at that time consisted of only eight people, an evangelist (or an expert on software development technologies, as was written on the business card).  Now we have more than 40 (the exact number depends on the method of counting).  Before Microsoft, I worked at <a href="http://www.docsvision.com/">DocsVision</a> , where I managed the development of this product.  And I started my professional career in IT at <a href="http://digdes.ru/">Digital Design as</a> a software developer.  Until now, I consider programming the most interesting activity in life, although I haven‚Äôt been doing it professionally for a long time. <br><br>  I, like my colleagues, found my other vocation: to make all developers, IT specialists, architects, technical students, in general, all technical specialists in Russia, more successful and happy.  And this is really the goal that big Microsoft sets for our department, without any embellishment.  And plans to enslave the world and the task of "be evil" really are not on our agenda. <a name="habracut"></a>

      The mission of our unit is: <br>  It is a clear concept of the Microsoft platform. <br><br>  Or, translated into Russian: <br>  Increase the number of people and companies in Russia who succeed by creating software and helping others to realize their potential using the Microsoft platform, technologies and tools. <br><br>  Now in Russia, the entire software industry brings in only 0.22% of GDP.  In the USA, for example, this share is 3%, and in Israel - as much as 4%.  I believe that our country, in which so many talented software developers live, deserves better than simply supplying oil and gas to the rest of the world.  That's why my colleagues and I are here. <br><br>  And Microsoft technologies are secondary here: we are here because we know and believe that using these technologies you can create applications and build information systems that can successfully interact with technologies and products from other manufacturers.  Microsoft spent $ 9.5 billion on R &amp; D last year.  Let us together make this money benefit our country and our technical experts! <br><br>  If Habr's readers have an interest, I will be ready to tell you more about what our department at Microsoft is doing.  In the meantime, I would like to introduce my colleagues who work with us and who are already writing or going to write on Habr√©. <br><br>  Let's get acquainted: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/87/ff/87ffc700e8b687508f87cf5c2bc8b7fe.jpg" alt="image" align="left">  <b>Roman Zdebsky</b> (full name - Romuald) coordinates the work of technical experts (evangelists) on software development and information infrastructure management.
