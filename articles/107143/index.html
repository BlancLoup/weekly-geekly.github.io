Today was another webcast with the results of Microsoft for the last quarter.  Unlike Apple and Google, Microsoft has already started 2011 fiscal year (July) - respectively, now is the time to sum up the results of the first quarter. <br><br>  Microsoft managed to set new records, exceeding the forecasts of experts.  <a href="http://www.shareholder.com/visitors/event/build2/MediaPresentation.cfm%3FMediaID%3D44364%26amp%3BMediaUserID%3D0%26amp%3Bplayer%3D1">Audio recording of the</a> speech, <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/Investor/EarningsAndFinancials/Earnings/PressReleaseAndWebcast/FY11/Q1/default.aspx">press release</a> and <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/investor/Downloads/Earnings%2520and%2520Financials/Earnings%2520Releases/PressRelease/FY11/Q1/Q1-FY11Slides.pptx">slides</a> with all the details are available to everyone.

      If you go to the figures, the revenue (revenue) for FY11Q1 was <strong>$ 16.2 billion</strong> , which is <strong>25%</strong> higher than last year.  Net income for the reporting period was <strong>$ 5.41 billion,</strong> which is <strong>51%</strong> higher than last year. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Microsoft traditionally reviews performance and products across all business segments - results showed growth in all areas over the past year, including a 15 percent increase at the start of sales of Office 2010, sales of Xbox 360 consoles increased by 38% overall, and in the US for the fourth month in a row maximum results compared to all competitors.  The next quarter there is an increase in the market share of the search engine Bing, which is accompanied by the continuation of cooperation with Yahoo - Bing is already on the issue in the United States and Canada.  Despite the growth in revenue compared with a year earlier, the online division of the Online Services Division continues to be unprofitable, and the volume of investment is not declining.  It is worth noting that Entertainment and Devices has been unprofitable for many years, but over the past quarters it has steadily turned out to be a plus.  Now, revenue only from the launch of the game Halo: Reach was $ 350 million. Windows Phone 7 is launched in Europe and the United States these days, and Kinect sales will start in early November. <br><br>  Much attention is paid to the most successful operating system in the history of the company, Windows 7, which turned out to be exactly a year before, its sales exceeded 240 million licenses.  The revenue of the Windows-division grew by 66% to $ 4.8 billion. <br><br>  Today at the <a href="http://microsoftpdc.com/">PDC</a> conference a series of announcements was made on the Windows Azure cloud platform, the number of subscriptions of which increased by 40%.  Business products Sharepoint, Lync (formerly Communication Server), Dynamics CRM and Exchange are showing two-digit growth. <br><br>  From the point of view of the personal computer market, it was noted that in the reporting quarter it grew by 9-11%, in emerging markets the growth is much higher than in developed ones.  The company does not see the departure of users from low-power computers (netbooks) on the tablets.  Instead, it was stated that the market for low-end computers continues to grow, and people buy more different devices, including tablets.  The latter are good opportunities for business growth in the future. <br><br>  It should be noted that the session of questions and answers was fairly calm and businesslike - in contrast to the more strategic and emotional reports in Google and Apple.  Perhaps this is due to the fact that Microsoft is now the beginning of the year, and not its end.  In addition, the call was not Steve Ballmer (usually the CEO does not participate in webcasts), the lead was the CFO Peter Kline. <br><br>  Most of the questions concerned the financial details of the figures, the analysis of the growth of the new first products in comparison with the previous ones and the immediate prospects. <br><br>  The beginning of the year for Microsoft was very successful, despite the record ending of the previous one.  Apple has exceeded revenue figures for the last months, however, Microsoft‚Äôs net profit is still ahead.  Google continues to grow, but remains behind. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/107143/">https://habr.com/ru/post/107143/</a></p>
