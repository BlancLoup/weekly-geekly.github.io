    </i>  <i>To be honest, we were a little puzzled by this situation, and we decided to see what the "fathers" founders think about censorship on the Internet.</i>  <i>The following is a translation of the <a href="http://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2014-02/06/tim-berners-lee-reclaim-the-web">conversation of the</a> publication Wired with Tim Berners-Lee.</i> <i><br></i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c9a/758/c2c/c9a758c2c9a8528a941b2c87e3c10d13.jpg" align="left" width="450"><br><br>  "I want to see an open Internet that works great internationally and is independent of countries," Berners-Lee told the audience.  He also gave one opposite example: ‚Äú <a href="http://finance.yahoo.com/news/rousseff-wants-servers-housed-brazil-223154730.html">I don‚Äôt want an Internet in which the Brazilian government stores all the social media data on servers in Brazil</a> .  Now it's even easier to substitute people. ‚Äù <br><br>  Twenty-five years after the creation of the Internet, its creator called on the public to return to the original device of the network: to the decentralized Internet, which, in fact, remains open to all, and said that although such openness has something to do with control over commercial Internet monopolies, for example, search engines and social networks, the greatest danger lies in the emergence of fragmented ("balkanized") Internet. <br><br>  Governments, startups and journalists should bring this topic to the fore, he added, because the pace of change is not slowing down - on the contrary, everything happens very quickly.  For his part, Berners-Lee raises this issue not only in his speeches at the Open Data Institute, the World Wide Web Consortium and the World Wide Web Foundation, but also as part of his work as a professor at MIT, whose students are ‚Äúbuilding new architectures for a decentralized web.‚Äù .  Concerning the monopolies, Berners-Lee noted that he was confused by ‚Äúdependence on large companies and one big server,‚Äù because they inhibit innovation, but competition has historically solved these issues and will continue to do so. <br><br><blockquote>  ‚ÄúIt is important for the geek community to remember its responsibility and think about what it can do.‚Äù </blockquote>  - Tim Berners-Lee <br><br>  The view of the ‚ÄúBalkanized‚Äù Network, which, in his opinion, is characteristic of Brazil and its home servers or the <a href="http://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2012-08/07/iran-offline">internal network</a> appearing in Iran, is partly based on statements about mass surveillance of the NSA and DSP.  The mistrust that they have caused at all levels, ranging from politicians and pumping ordinary citizens to possible self-censorship, threatens an open network more than <a href="http://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2013-11/22/web-index-2013">ordinary censorship</a> .  The fact that the NSA is <a href="http://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2014-01/03/nsa-quantum-computer">capable of hacking into commercial types of encryption</a> can lead to the emergence of networks like the Great China Firewall, which are designed to ‚Äúprotect‚Äù citizens.  Therefore, we should limit the work of official bodies a little, says Berners-Lee. <br><br>  He reiterated the need to <a href="http://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2013-11/07/tim-berners-lee-nsa">protect informers</a> , for example, Edward Snowden, who only merge information in extreme circumstances, "because they feel their role in society."  But even more, he noted the importance of hackers. <br><br>  ‚ÄúThis is a very special culture, it is important that the geeks community remember their responsibility and think about what it can do.  We need new voices that can stand up to the government. ‚Äù <br><br>  Even with the political and social concerns around him, this person has changed the ways of communication, education, protests and much more.  Until now, he has been devoting himself in so many ways to the struggle for the Internet based on freedom and openness.  But when asked what he would do differently, there was a simple answer.  ‚ÄúI would get rid of the two slashes after the colon.  They are not needed.  Just a long time ago they seemed like a good idea. ‚Äù <br></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/212105/">https://habr.com/ru/post/212105/</a></p>
