  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Actual OS for old PC or netbook</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/n7/rv/zi/n7rvzimddxhi7oau4v5wy1sfyqw.jpeg" alt="image"></div><br><p>  Surely, many of you are gathering dust somewhere in an old computer / laptop / netbook, which cannot be upgraded anymore, it is impossible to sell, and it is a pity to throw it out.  Indeed, you should not hurry with this, because it may well be useful to someone.  Maybe even you. </p><br><p>  While I was thinking about what to do with my old stuff (and the Samsung NC10 and Asus U5F were lying around), I caught this <a href="https://mashtips.com/lightweight-os/">text</a> on the web.  Understand English thought, I hope, is clear.  But for the rest, a completely obvious idea is to replace the old PC with a less demanding operating system, but it is quite relevant.  Then this computer can be given to children for simple toys, grandma for Skype, mother for surfing the web, or even use it yourself. </p><a name="habracut"></a><br><p>  If you take the squeeze and develop the idea, you should pay attention to: </p><br><p>  1) <a href="https://lubuntu.net/">Lubuntu</a> - here is a full-fledged OS for a computer, with the ability to install various programs like the Firefox or Chrome browser, the LibreOffice office suite (similar to Microsoft Office), and the usual file saving on a local disk.  Promises to be brisk on the old iron.  It‚Äôs still good with its relative popularity and support (read for a long time), but it‚Äôs not quite clear if this usefulness is necessary to an ordinary user of a weak netbook?  Of the minuses - because  this is a distinctive Linux, there is almost no compatibility with Windows programs.  But for me, depending on the tasks, this is quite possible for a regular Windows user to live.  The benefit of browsers and messengers are the same, and you can not be afraid of viruses.  By the way, this is true for all other systems in the list below.  It is quite possible to make an impression about the system on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3D24iMnpAQQNo">this video</a> , even if it is not about the latest version (it‚Äôs better to watch video 1.5 times faster). </p><br><p>  2) <a href="https://zorinos.com/download/lite/">Zorin OS Lite</a> is an excellent and most important modern version of Linux, which at the same time looks like Windows and right out of the box provides support for running some Windows programs.  Lite version promises to work normally even on very old hardware.  Available immediately a lot of useful programs including.  the same LibreOffice, support for the Russian language and modern software, available for popular Linux systems such as the famous Ubuntu.  Here you can quickly see what ZorinOS is.  In my opinion it looks pretty. </p><br><p>  3) <a href="http://www.phoenixos.com/download_x86">Phoenix OS</a> is an interesting thing - in fact, this is modern Android, like in any smartphone, but which can be installed on a regular computer and enjoy all the benefits of this truly most popular system.  Phoenix is ‚Äã‚Äãactively <a href="https://4pda.ru/forum/index.php%3Fshowtopic%3D719317">discussed on the forums</a> .  They say that even on an old netbook everything works smartly.  It is hard to believe, but you can easily check;) Of the minuses - since most of the programs available in GooglePlay are created taking into account that they will be used on a smartphone or tablet, they may look a bit strange on a laptop.  In other matters, the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DwoCokcWfjFo">official demo</a> clearly shows that the developers have taken care of everything to be as convenient as possible, the browser and instant messengers will work fine, but with the editing of documents there can be problems characteristic of Android.  On the other hand, there will be an up-to-date modern software and an environment familiar to owners of smartphones and tablets, and this favorably distinguishes this option from ordinary Linux systems. </p><br><p>  4) <a href="https://www.neverware.com/freedownload">CloudReady: Home Edition</a> from Neverware - the current free version of the cloudy <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromium_OS">Chromium OS</a> , very close to <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chrome_OS">Google's Chrome OS</a> .  In practice, this is only a browser and all Web applications run inside it.  Nothing extra.  Created specifically for netbooks.  This <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DYUkmZskPnE8">video</a> allows you to make an impression about the system.  Of the minuses - without the Internet, this is almost a useless thing, but when connected to the network, the whole palette of cloud services is at your service.  No installation, settings, updates, antiviruses and other nonsense - all online.  No ordinary applications work (except that you can run programs for Android in a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DFEXtce3des8">tricky way</a> ).  <a href="https://guide.neverware.com/critical-requirements/">It</a> is <a href="https://guide.neverware.com/critical-requirements/">installed</a> very <a href="https://neverware.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/227876668-Create-an-alternate-CloudReady-installer-on-Windows-using-Rufus-">simply</a> , no red-eyed dances with a tambourine to you - launched, connected to the network and everything is ready for work. </p><br><p>  Think, maybe before you stupidly get rid of rubbish with an old woman of Windows XP, you should try to revive it a little at least programmatically, since it does not give in to a hardware upgrade?  To help make the final choice in favor of only one of the options is quite difficult for me, because  I don‚Äôt know all your tasks and requirements, but for some reason it seems to me that the list has been formed in order of increasing preference for an ordinary inexperienced user.  If nothing except the browser is needed, and web applications are enough, then option 4 is an obvious choice, at the same time the question of backing up data is practically eliminated, since  Everything is synchronized to Google Drive.  If a person has a positive experience with an Android smartphone or tablet, then, if you have the same Google account, the third option also looks quite good.  If you really need something specific to Windows or absolutely no willingness to face something new, unknown and unlike Windows, then this is the second option.  Well, if a person is open to everything new and requires maximum opportunity, reliability, flexibility and support, then this is the first option.  On Habr√© was translated <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/ua-hosting/blog/342826/">article</a> , which can help choose the most suitable of these. </p><br><p>  And it is better to send to the dump zomboyaschik and cooled fast food. </p><br><p>  <strong>Ps.</strong>  Please send comments on spelling, punctuation and so on.  in lichku.  Everything will be promptly corrected. </p></div>
