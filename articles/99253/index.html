  <section class="page js-page"><h1>HTC Desire - transition from WM to Android</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Somehow, unexpectedly, I got HTC Desire, now I'm trying to move it from HTC Max 4G.  If anyone is too lazy to read, then I will immediately write a conclusion: the device itself is very pleasant, the OS is decent and promising, though without a normal stylus (personally I) is bad.  But with the application software is still a problem, sometimes you have to shaman.  Although in the end, more or less tolerable replacements used to pick up the software failed. <br><br><img src="http://i9.fastpic.ru/big/2010/0813/69/337cdfc731c7592a356a6ee89a9d6169.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  After buying Desire, it turned out that there are only free applications in the market, and the paid ones must either be tried to download from the developer sites, or get cracked.  Therefore, we had to attend to getting the root - only for the sake of access to the paid market (although in the end a couple of nice buns were added, such as the ability to make a complete dump of the phone‚Äôs memory or disable ads in applications).  The native firmware with the root did not normally stand up, I patched the <a href="http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php%3Fp%3D6371315">Pays-ROM</a> .  The choice, of course, is not the most correct, for good it was worth taking <a href="http://android.modaco.com/content/htc-desire-desire-modaco-com/307881/27-may-r3-1-modaco-custom-rom-for-htc-desire-with-online-kitchen/">MoDaCo</a> - it is closer to the original one, but the Pays-ROM was downloaded earlier.  :) A few days after I installed the firmware, the official 2.2 was released.  I wandered around for a long time in circles in meditations or not, then I saw a sensible whatsnew, read it and decided.  At first I tried Pays-ROM based on 2.2, but did not like it, rolled back.  And the version from MoDaCo (r7) completely arranged for me - based on the original 2.2, some unnecessary programs were removed, a root was added.  And that's all.  Stotyaschk additional programs are not installed - then add myself.

      I like the attitude of Google to programs that require root - in the market they are present on a common basis.  Also in the market there is a very convenient feature - a refund for the program during the day.  In the Apple store, it is greatly lacking. <br><br>  Tasks: <br>  1. Reading fb2, fb2.zip, txt, html, doc directly from the file system.  In WM <a href="http://alreader.com/">alreader</a> coped with this.  Explanatory substitutions have not yet found.  Now there are three pieces. <br><br>  <a href="http://apps.doubletwist.com/FBReader/5420964508807930135">fbreader</a> does not read txt, doc and html, does not work directly with the file system, but scans the flash drive for the presence of supported files.  But reads fb2. <br>  <a href="http://apps.doubletwist.com/iReader-%2528Free-version%2529/-5471743637364635619">ireader (free)</a> long opens large html-files, does not store them in history, does not remember the position.  There is no normal hyphenation - Russian spells, English - just weird.  Problems with the definition of cp1251 - considers it different versions of Unicode.  Sometimes crashes.  There is no special reason to buy a paid one, unless you need DRM support. <br>  <a href="http://4pda.ru/forum/index.php%3Fshowtopic%3D115283">conreader</a> reads only txt, and Russian and English spells, works faster than ireader, until it crashes.  But the open file dialog is inconvenient, there is no text search. <br><br>  So, all that remains is to switch between different readers and hope that Alan is still porting the alreader - he said, <i>‚ÄúI can promise to carry out such a port during 2010 if the device is available.‚Äù</i>  The device was bought for him, now we are waiting for the end of the year.  :) <br><br>  2. File manager.  In WM, I used Resco Explorer.  Then liked <a href="http://apps.doubletwist.com/EStrongs-File-Explorer/-8748423688071500065">EStrongs File Explorer</a> .  Many people advised <a href="http://apps.doubletwist.com/ASTRO-File-Manager/3521322703668947709">ASTRO File Manager</a> , but this scrolling stripe with buttons seemed uncomfortable.  To unpack the archives, I installed <a href="http://apps.doubletwist.com/AndroZip-File-Manager/2584190422861019238">AndroZip</a> (although you can use it as a file manager). <br><br>  3. Calculator.  In WM - <a href="http://4pda.ru/forum/index.php%3Fshowtopic%3D19747">igcalc</a> .  We need a minimum - large buttons, two lines (in one expression that can be edited, in the second result), percentages, memory.  But all this is not found in one calculator.  Either the buttons are small, or there are no percentages, or there is no memory ... I looked through a dozen or two, so far I stopped at <a href="http://apps.doubletwist.com/RealCalc-Scientific-Calculator/-6967133214380642542">RealCalc</a> (there is everything but two lines). <br><br>  4. Navigation.  I mainly use <a href="http://apps.doubletwist.com/Yandex.Maps/8941344824806913660">Yandex.karty</a> (I do not need car navigation).  Everything is fine here, in terms of functionality it is not inferior to the version for WM, it significantly surpasses the speed of operation (I didn‚Äôt try to run the cards on HD2, then I don‚Äôt know from the processor this speed or from the android).  For raster maps I use <a href="http://apps.doubletwist.com/yozi/7461801659651853892">Yozi</a> , which understands maps in Ozi formats.  The functionality is minimal, but enough for me. <br><br>  5. Program for notes and reminders.  In WM there was <a href="http://www.apsoftsystems.com/apmemo/">apmemo</a> - a stylus sketched the text, in two clicks set the reminder time.  So far, nothing interesting found.  The absence of the stylus is fine, but in all the programs that I have tried, too many gestures must be done to create a note and set a reminder.  I want to be able to enter the text of the note at the start, and not to press "the menu - create a note". <br><br>  6. <a href="http://www.popcap.com/games/free/bejeweled2">Bejeweled2</a> - unfortunately, not found.  There are first bejeweled, there are all sorts of jewels, but no joy from them.  :) Put <a href="http://apps.doubletwist.com/Jewellust/8464035915476416274">Jewellust</a> , its 3 bucks it cost, but it ended too quickly.  Now, as a Bejeweled2, earns additionally <a href="http://apps.doubletwist.com/Sweep/3235878804901582106">Sweep</a> .  :) <br><br>  7. <a href="http://www.isotope244.com/atomic_cannon_pocket.html">Atomic cannon</a> - an excellent implementation of Scorched earth for WM.  I found barrage and goobers vs boogers, but both games look pale, and the graphics and management are so-so.  There is also Armored Strike Online, but it is online, which is not always convenient.  Although recently ran the news that soon the Angry birds on the android will be.  I am waiting. <br><br>  8. View and edit unprecedented Excel files.  <a href="http://apps.doubletwist.com/Documents-To-Go-2.0-Main-App/2978032577393184508">Documents to Go</a> .  $ 15, free version - view only.  At the same time another part of the first paragraph is solved - view doc. <br><br>  9. ICQ.  <a href="http://apps.doubletwist.com/IM%252B/3189056662416862666">IM +</a> , but maybe I'll pay it sometime.  It seemed cute Meego, but there are constantly climbing advertising messages from AOL at the entrance annoying.  Fring strongly advised, but his interface is too coarse, in my opinion. <br><br>  10. Metro map of Moscow and St. Petersburg.  It was yandex.metro.  The choice is <a href="http://apps.doubletwist.com/Ru.Metro/-431307469681885723">Ru.Metro</a> and <a href="http://4pda.ru/forum/index.php%3Fshowtopic%3D171437">aMetro</a> .  The first is put from the market, the second is put from the forum w3bsit3-dns.com, then the cards are loaded separately.  I stopped at aMetro, I like it, although I would like to finish something on the little things. <br><br>  11. Remote control. <br>  RDP and VNC - <a href="http://apps.doubletwist.com/Wyse-PocketCloud-RDP-VNC--BETA/-9189561320025136143">Wyse PocketCloud</a> .  While beta, until August 31 is free, but when it becomes paid, I will pay for it, a convenient program. <br>  SSH - not yet picked up.  ConnectBot doesn‚Äôt take long keystrokes, enters both characters (I want to enter ‚Äú-‚Äù, press and hold ‚Äún‚Äù, and finally get ‚Äún-.‚Äù If anyone knows how to win, I will say thank you. <br><br>  13. Any multimedia. <br>  View images.  <a href="http://apps.doubletwist.com/JustPictures!/6810252484513974039">Justpictures</a> . <br>  For music (for now) I have enough of my own player, I don‚Äôt watch movies on the phone. <br><br>  In minuses: reader, reminders, ssh-client, stylus. <br>  In the pros: the browser (although I had to put <a href="http://apps.doubletwist.com/Dolphin-Browser-HD/-303506664310424543">Dolphin Browser HD</a> ), the overall speed of the device.  For these two points is ready to endure the cons and wait for their elimination. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/99253/">https://habr.com/ru/post/99253/</a></p>
