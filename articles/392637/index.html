  <section class="page js-page"><h1>All IKEA LED bulbs</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  IKEA LED lamps are deservedly considered by many to be the best that can be bought in Russia.  First of all, many IKEA Ledare lamps have a very high (91.1-96.1) color rendering index (CRI) and it should be noted that these are actually the only lamps with a CRI&gt; 90 available in our country.  Many IKEA lamps are cheaper than competitors with better parameters.  In IKEA, more than half of the lamps support brightness control (dimming). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/a13/9d7/9b0/a139d79b0b04574633d4307297f11df3.jpg"><br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Of course, there are problems.  Some earlier IKEA lamps had a high level of light pulsation.  For those lamps that are sold now, the ripple level does not exceed 20%, which is even lower than the ripple of incandescent light.  Dimmable lamps buzz when adjusting the brightness, and the volume of this sound depends on the type of dimmer used.  Some dimmable lamps have too high a minimum of dimming, which does not allow the twilight to achieve when adjusting their brightness.

      Now in the assortment of stores IKEA 31 LED lamp.  Many lamps appeared recently, in February 2016.  29 lamps have a color temperature of 2700K, exactly corresponding to the color of the illumination of incandescent lamps and only two lamps have a color temperature of 4000K. <br><br>  I bought and tested 28 bulbs.  Three lamps from those that are on the site, was not on sale.  This is a 200 Lm candle with transparent openwork glass, a G45 400 Lm E14 bulb and a GX53 400 Lm spot with lenses.  Spot GU10 200 Lm was sold at a reduced price of 79 rubles and it is possible that it can no longer be bought - it is not on the site. <br><br>  I measured the parameters of the lamps using the instruments <a href="http://ammo1.livejournal.com/470834.html">Viso LightSpion</a> and <a href="http://ammo1.livejournal.com/621744.html">Lupine</a> .  To measure the minimum dimming level, the Rainbow EcoDim digital dimmer was used in the cut-off mode of the sine wave front. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/3ba/31f/0d1/3ba31f0d195d83217f0ee956139e3699.png"><br><br>  Most lamps work correctly with switches that have an indicator and only 9 lamps flash when such a switch is turned off. <br><br>  16 lamps support brightness control (dimming).  With a digital dimmer, the lower dimming threshold is 3-17%, with conventional dimmers, for most lamps, the lower threshold is 18-23%.  For example, a pear lamp 600 Lm allows you to adjust the brightness in the range of 5-100% using a digital dimmer, and with the IKEA dimmer, the adjustment range was only 19-100%. <br>  When dimming, all the lamps emit a sound, the volume of which depends on the model of dimmer used.  In most cases, the sound is quite quiet and at a distance of two meters is not audible.  The pulsation of light during dimming does not increase. <br><br>  The level of light pulsation in all lamps is from 1 to 20%.  Let me remind you that the pulsation of the light of ordinary incandescent bulbs is 8-32%, so that there is nothing terrible in the pulsation of 20% - the human eye does not perceive the pulsation below 40%. <br><br>  All new IKEA lamps do not indicate the equivalent of an incandescent lamp - buyers are taught to designate lamp brightness in lumens.  And it is right.  On the IKEA website there is such a sign. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/830/cee/c21/830ceec21a117eeb9fa18f63ee10e88a.png"><br><br>  The measured luminous flux of 13 lamps corresponds to the stated or even exceeds it.  In 8 lamps the luminous flux is 1-5% lower than stated, in 5 lamps by 6-9%, in two lamps by 11% and only in one lamp by 13%. <br><br>  The color temperature is close to the stated one and only for RYET lamps it is close to 2800K, and not to the declared 2700K.  Light bulbs are very similar to ordinary incandescent bulbs. <br><br>  Most lamps have a very high color rendering index (CRI, Ra), which is not found in any other lamps available on the Russian market.  The most popular lamps have a CRI of about 92. <br><br>  The table of color transmission of the ‚ÄúPear 600 Lm‚Äù lamp 303.059.76 LED1466G9. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/fe4/f62/fdd/fe4f62fdd15dc3ec71f7b6d6d4f0a4dc.png"><br><br>  The cheap RYET series has a CRI of about 83, so we can safely say that even RYET lamps are better than most other brands of lamps on the Russian market, because they have an honest value of the luminous flux, low ripple, quite decent CRI value, and most importantly, low price. . <br><br>  Color transmission table for the Pear 600 Lm RYET lamp 503.220.22 LED1512G8. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/f44/bed/853/f44bed8531c6ccb13d620852873df285.png"><br><br>  Photos of two disassembled RYET lamps can be viewed here in this review: <a href="http://testlamp.ru/testirovanie-lamp-serii-riet-5-5vt-i-3vt-torgovoy-marki-ikea/">link</a> . <br><br>  All IKEA lamps can be recommended for residential lighting. <br><br>  Most of the IKEA lamps are produced in one factory in China - the bar code of the lamps made in this factory ends at 21,633. Several lamps are made at the second Chinese factory (the bar code ends at 19972), several lamps at the third (22,237), and only one lamp is made in Germany (barcode ends at 22858). <br><br>  All IKEA lamps have a service life of 25,000 hours and a 2 year warranty (although this is not indicated anywhere).  During the year, any lamp can be returned without explanation, even if the package has been opened. <br><br>  IKEA lamps are really one of the best LED lamps that can be bought in Russia for the following reasons: <br>  ‚Ä¢ Very high color rendering index of most Ledare lamps; <br>  ‚Ä¢ Compliance with the declared luminous flux; <br>  ‚Ä¢ The color temperature is 2700K (and not 3000K, like most competitors have), exactly corresponding to the color temperature of incandescent lamps; <br>  ‚Ä¢ The ability to adjust the brightness of most lamps; <br>  ‚Ä¢ 2 year warranty and trouble free exchange under warranty; <br>  ‚Ä¢ Ability to return the lamp throughout the year. <br><br>  All the parameters of the tested lamps, as well as all the other results of my tests of LED lamps, look at <a href="http://lamptest.ru/">lamptest.ru</a> . <br><br>  2016, Alexey Nadyozhin </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/392637/">https://habr.com/ru/post/392637/</a></p>
