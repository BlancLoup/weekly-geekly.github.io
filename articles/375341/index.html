My story began with the fact that I just wanted to buy a reliable and powerful electric bike, by the way, I never managed to do this. <br><br>  Do not share invaluable experience in achieving the goal - means to commit a crime against humanity, interested in electric cars.  But first things first. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  For the first time on the street I saw an electric bike, being in a traffic jam in Moscow on Leninsky Avenue.  Someone was driving, it seemed, on an ordinary mountain bike, rapidly overcoming a long climb without any effort on the pedals at a speed of about 30 km per hour.  He moved silently and looked unusually, but on the trunk was fixed as if a box of shoes - well, of course, it's his battery there, for sure - it's great with an electric motor, I immediately determined.  I also wanted to rush uphill like that, bypassing kilometer traffic jams, and not in straining to take care of the ecology of the city.  This is a real buzz. <br><br>  Googled and realized that today the Internet is teeming with proposals for cycling hybrids for every taste, mainly from China and not only.  The stores sell men and women, folding, children and adults, steep serial and good alterations from high quality into a hybrid.  Now there is even an exclusive elektrokastombike and three-wheeled handmade electric trays.  You can find cheap and super expensive hybrids with weak, powerful and very powerful electric motors and the same different batteries.

      I do not impose my personal observations on anyone, I just wanted to buy a beautiful, powerful and durable bicycle hybrid, I looked at a dozen different models, I was disappointed in many of them, and then I changed my mind about buying something and decided to make my own electric bike on my own frame, hoping to get powerful and durable electric bike, saving a lot of money, but more on that later. <br><br>  I know what I need, I want to ride an electric bike in winter and summer, every day for short and long distances, on different roads, fall and, if health allows, go on it further, overcome deep snow and go further, get under the pouring rain, and also go further.  To pay only for worn out brake pads and for the spent electricity, to charge the hybrid for two hours and not to think about breakdowns.  If I want just such an electric bike, in this case, I have to fork out for a lump sum, well, let it be, I want just such an electric bike! <br><br>  Expensive, so cute - cheap, but rotten.  But a very expensive bike does not mean powerful yet.  Of course, you need to look again, compare and choose.  I especially want to mention models from Europe, Australia and America.  Among the very expensive and powerful electric cars, there are even copies from Ukraine and Russia.  I saw and felt many, but, specifically, I will tell only one thing, because because of him I made the final decision to produce my own powerful and durable bicycle hybrid. <br><br>  What are very expensive hybrids for me?  - This model is priced at 120 thousand rubles and above.  Believe there are offers for 200 thousand, 300, 500 and so on.  The main thing is that the price matches the quality.  On the road, good and powerful bike, I was ready to spend 250 thousand rubles. <br><br>  For a long time I chose my powerful hybrid. There are a lot of offers, but really I only liked one and it cost me like my car.  So, the lip is not a fool, I chose the coolest and most beautiful, for my taste, bicycle hybrid from Australia Stealth B. - a great option, a deadly price.  Today, dealers offer this cross hybrid for any roads from 400 thousand rubles.  Very expensive and the most popular in the whole world, high-quality bike, is presented in three different versions. <br><br>  After a personal acquaintance, despite the sickly price, I was seized with a fanatical desire to purchase this particular electric bike.  Fell in love with him, as in childhood in the "Kama".  No other hybrids interested me anymore. I didn‚Äôt want to look anymore, everything in the Australian, at first glance, was perfect, everything except the price.  High-tech frame, cool expensive components, motor wheel 3500 W, modern design - I dreamed only of him.  The speed develops up to 70 km per hour, the range of up to 60 km distance and even pedals can be driven :), but perhaps, for the sake of sight, the bike's weight is 52 kg.  By the way, the "Australian" battery charge time is 2 hours. <br><br>  Heavy hybrid, but it was the most desirable unit in my whole life.  I dreamed of forgetting about the traffic jams for six months a year and becoming a super fashionable electric biker.  Take the first rows of "green" and ride around the city without polluting the environment.  And, most importantly, keep up everywhere.  Unfortunately, I was delirious, the dealer price of the ‚ÄúAustralian‚Äù was impossible for me to master at once, except to sell the car.  I was upset, of course, and then he cheered up after analyzing controversial comments about this bike hybrid.  Well, firstly for such money - a very weak battery. <br><br>  Secondly - even though it looks cool, but the ‚Äúholey‚Äù heavy frame is not intended for pokatushek in the rain.  Thirdly, on the American forums, they fiercely discussed the difficulties of warranty service, especially if the owner doesn‚Äôt fumble in electronics and has read a lot of gossip about the inevitable minor breakdowns, but everything is cured. Do manufacturers, dealers and owners ‚Äúreally write on the Internet about controversial pros and cons?‚Äù Australian ", I do not know - maybe all articles are generally custom.  If he were cheaper two times, he would have bought for sure, and you can't jump over your head, I calmed myself. <br><br>  Having retired Stealth, some time later, on one of the profile forums, I found a bicycle hybrid from Europe that was close in spirit to me, and in its technical characteristics and design to my Australian dream, but it also upset me - with its price of 340 thousand rubles.  I counted on 250 thousand no more.  I also searched, found on the Internet two affordable and very strange-looking domestic cycle hybrid.  Out of curiosity, I went and got acquainted with them personally. <br><br>  Components and attachments were of tolerable quality, even the max controller stood on the frames like a glove - almost as powerful as an Australian, the price was 180 and 200 thousand rubles.  It would be possible to choose one of the two and buy.  But I did not like the fact that their steel frames looked disproportionate, too high and wide, the weight of one was 12 kg, the second was 14 kg, both of them were confused by ‚Äúlittered‚Äù forks.  As it turned out, both electric bicycles are not commercially produced in Moscow. <br><br>  According to reviews, one of the models is generally welded incorrectly and after a fall under load - it can change geometrically.  And the load of a truly powerful electric drill is as follows: the average weight of the steel frame is 10 kg, the attachment and accessories are 5k g, the motor wheel is about 13 kg, the battery is 15-25 kg and the driver, for example, 75 kg.  That is, a powerful high-speed bicycle hybrid can weigh from 43 to 53 kg and even more depending on the battery. <br><br>  I remember the words of the seller of these bikes - if the frame does not stand, then the crack can be boiled, buy, do not worry, while no one complained.  In general, this is also not my option.  I feel sorry for this money.  Although many people buy these and other suspicious hybrids, chase them, and say - they do not know the evils.  By the way, I could purchase a frame separately from the components and assemble the bike in my own way.  But I didn‚Äôt like any of the frames, as well as the hybrids collected on the same frames.  The preference is only ‚ÄúAustralian‚Äù, but its frame is not sold separately.  Well, and if they were sold, then for 200 thousand rubles, probably. <br><br>  And if I did not make my own powerful electric two-wheeled vehicle.  Buy steel, weld the frame, stuff it with good components and voila!  This is a bike with a motor. Well, what is so complicated here, it seemed to me at that time, how wrong I was. <br><br>  I understood that I could not cope alone and I clearly needed a like-minded person.  Now I pulled my friend into my dream - now there were two of us and together we really wanted to make our own lightweight, powerful electric bike. <br><br>  We watched a dozen videos, read hundreds of articles and comments on the creation and assembly of electric jets.  After examining other people's achievements and mistakes in the ‚Äúinvention of electric bicycles‚Äù, we began to paint the ‚Äúskeleton‚Äù, that is, the double-hanging frame of our future hybrid.  Inspiration drew from the "Australian." <br><br>  We backed up our engineering ambitions with a special program that allows you to correctly draw the frame, measure the space for the battery you need, calculate the angle of the fork glass so that the fork works correctly, calculate the load and geometry of the pendulum, the angle of the rear monoamortizer, calculate the load and weight of the frame as a whole and t .d <br><br>  In the process of developing the frame, we did a project cost estimate; we did not take into account the assembly of the cycle hybrid.  Taking into account the manufacture of the steel frame, taking into account the quality and powerful filling of the hybrid, the turnkey project began to cost 324500 rubles.  For such a sum it was already possible to buy a serial cool electric bike, but, not as powerful and durable as we will be - we reassured each other.  There is no way back - he took the ball - n ... dich. <br><br>  We decided to pre-order the most expensive and difficult to build a powerful hybrid in Russia from metropolitan electric dealers - this is a good, repeatable, good and reliable powerful battery, powerful high-quality motor wheel, good controller with lots of opportunities - the choice fell on the max controller made, you won‚Äôt believe , in the Moscow office, and bms-ku ordered there as well - it expanded the capabilities of the max controller and the high voltage converter to 12 volts, DC-DC, in common DiSishka, to connect the dimensions, headlight, stop signal, sound  signal, etc. <br><br>  Ordered a good "foot" under the accelerator and under the electromagnetic brake.  Only these gadgets cost us a total of 193,500 rubles.  Not sickly, huh?  Such are the prices - google - see for yourself.  In more detail, I painted the prices of purchased components at the end of the article.  It was possible, of course, to save money and buy a battery and an engine without intermediaries, to order spare parts directly from the country of origin.  But we never did this ourselves and, honestly, did not want to risk such big money, you never know.  So, they bought everything they wanted without problems and from trusted people. <br><br>  When creating the frame, we encountered a whole bunch of technical nuances, which delayed the birth of the completed sketch and drawings for 2 months.  That space for the desired number of batteries did not work, the frame itself loomed incorrectly, the mechanism of the pendulum somehow did not get up on the frame, then one or the other. <br><br>  In the end, the frame was drawn and we really liked it.  There remained one unresolved question - this, as it seemed to us, is the heavy weight of the steel frame.  And let's weld it out of titanium - said my friend.  Come on - I agreed, knowing that titan would make our project so expensive that even more expensive.  But, if it works out, then we will become the owners of a very durable, lightweight bicycle hybrid in a very short time and ‚Äúfast money‚Äù.  And, perhaps, we will be the first to assemble a powerful high-speed electric bike on titanium. <br><br>  In general, we decided to take a chance.  And rushed. I had to look for the right low-cost titanium and modern offices to implement our ideas.  A few days later we barely found the only company in which we were offered to buy a cheap titanium 3-meter cylinder for a carriage and a glass for a fork, we did not sell a smaller length.  Three sheets of the best titanium for our frame with a thickness of 2.4 mm, cut metal into our drawing with a laser and, finally, within a month, weld the frame.  Our project now began to cost 386100 rubles without assembly.  I see a purpose, but I do not see obstacles. <br><br>  After we bought titanium, in the office for unprecedented reasons, they refused to cooperate with us, citing the lack of time, the complexity of the task and the receipt of some urgent state.  order.  This is a BRAIN!  We plunged titanium into a gazelle and drove away.  But whatever is done is for the best ... <br><habracut><br>  According to the results in the near future, none of the new offices found by us, did not want to undertake the manufacture of a titanium frame.  A month later, we accidentally went to a research institute for repair of aircraft engines.  What a luck - the head of this company really liked the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãan environmentally friendly high-speed cycle hybrid and he decided to help us - and we were satisfied with the deadlines, and the bill for laser cutting and welding of titanium was not more than in the previous office.  In the process of reviewing our project by a local engineer, it became clear to us that the drawing should be redrawn a bit.  Otherwise, the frame may not work because of some features of titanium. <br><br>  The engineer gave us some tips - how best to change the design of the pendulum and make a different gain, how to strengthen the glass under the fork, and also suggested to us the most correct geometry of the frame itself for better welding.  After finalizing the drawings, we got a completely different bicycle hybrid.  The frame has become more brutal and angular, but the electric bike will be light and on a very solid basis, we rejoiced.  The definition of titanium from Wikipedia was warming the soul - Titanium is corrosion resistant due to an oxide film.  Titanium is the most important structural material in aircraft and rocket production, in shipbuilding.  Titanium alloy is 12 times harder than aluminum and 4 times stronger and almost 2 times lighter than steel. <br><br>  The day came H. Ramu cooked - everything turned out.  The total weight of the frame, or rather, the weight of the pendulum, the box with the lid for the battery, the assemblies and amplifiers was 7 kg 450 grams - not bad enough considering the high strength of titanium.  All the parts for the assembly of the cycle hybrid have already been purchased and we started the assembly of the ‚Äúcross-over‚Äù.  They decided not to paint Rama, only a couple of structural elements were ‚Äúcovered‚Äù with gold.  In the process of not easy assembly, on this topic I will write an article separately, we came up with a name for our brainchild - Storm Titan. <br><br>  It is a little about the main accessories of our frame and their cost. <br>  The power part - the cost in rubles: <br>  - MAX-E controller - 25 000 <br>  - Battery (battery) 3500 W \ h (LiIon, 320 elements) 86 volts - 120 000 <br>  - battery protection board - MAX-BMS - 3,500 <br>  - DC to 12 volt voltage converter - 5 000 <br>  - 4-piston hydraulic front disc brake - Avid - 8,000 <br>  - Electromagnetic rear brake appeared, thanks to the settings of the wonderful controller <br>  - rear motoobod DID Japan 19'- 9 000 <br>  - and motocross tires - 5500 <br>  a reliable 3500 W electric motor - 40,000 (in combination with a battery and a controller, in peak began to give out 9000W, the motor was spit on US 4.5 mm motorcycles) <br>  - front wheel 26 'for downhill assembly -10 000 <br>  - rear mono shock HONDA 650 LBS - 9 000 <br>  - front fork - VOLCANO - 20,000 <br><br>  I will not write about the rest of the attachments, there is nothing special or important in it - I will say one thing - they put only high-quality components.  I almost forgot about the purchase of charging for our hybrid with a capacity of 2 kilowatts, which allows you to charge the battery in 2 hours - 10,000 rubles. <br><br>  Without taking into account the cost of assembling a hybrid, but taking into account the cost of small consumables and the attachment equipment not indicated in the list, along with the production of the frame, our first bicycle hybrid ‚Äúfor dry‚Äù cost 386,100 rubles.  But we do not regret it at all - because, thanks to the excellent filling and the titanium frame, we got a powerful electric bike with a total weight of 37 kg - with a maximum speed of 105 km / h and a range of 140 km with an average speed of 50 km / h. <br><br>  Then there were all sorts of tests and tests for breaking the welds of the frame - and the strength of the bike as a whole - everything went well - there are no complaints.  Then we collected three more cyclists and sold them to Kazakhstan under our name Storm Titan. <br><br>  Few earned money and covered the expense and overrun in the manufacture of "firstborn".  It is absolutely clear that our electric bike is not cheap, but rather super expensive, but people who are interested in our bike are not simple, interested in powerful and durable cyclo-hybrids made in Russia. <br><br>  Friends offered us to designate ourselves somehow and we decided to create a company.  Created a site.  Several dynamic amateur videos about the capabilities of our e-bike were filmed on GOPRO, it‚Äôs a pity that they were only recently uploaded to Youtube. <br><br>  At the moment we are working on the creation of an exclusively road electric bicycles, capable of driving up to 400 kilometers without recharging at a speed of 80 km / h, only now, I am afraid, very few people can withstand such a load on the ass.  I hope you were interested in reading my article.  Thank you very much for your attention.  We are for environmentally friendly transport. <br><br>  Cranks, pedals and a chain are temporarily dismantled, replaced with pegs from bmx, you can return everything to its place if necessary, but now it is winter, it is hard to pedal. <br><br><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/52b/7b8/426/52b7b8426d714bd7939c3501b840e456.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/bde/704/a2a/bde704a2a4bf4b58a616dcb002533fe2.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f4c/88f/332/f4c88f3321d0429db45449f2cb417507.jpeg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/284/f2c/ac6/284f2cac622142ed9b7b177a64ef66e6.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/386/bf6/83d/386bf683dc5c40909c6a2b5ef722e5e3.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/652/7a2/d03/6527a2d03fb846108334986ed915790e.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/4f2/6e1/8e0/4f26e18e08594efeba9f26a75d7b38be.JPG"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d38/876/1d7/d388761d78d94ccba6c67c911459891a.jpeg"></habracut></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/375341/">https://habr.com/ru/post/375341/</a></p>
