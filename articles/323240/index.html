Moreover, simultaneously with HostingCon Global there will be a Data Center World Global conference in the same building.

Nevertheless, the situation on the hosting services market is forcing many ‚Äúcompetitors‚Äù to play an unfair game in our address, they are annoyed by the fact that despite the ‚Äúcrisis‚Äù - customers come to us, not only individuals, but large companies and people in Most of them are satisfied with the quality of services they receive, and when they are not satisfied, we do our best to satisfy their demands.  It is well known that customers themselves write positive reviews rarely, only negative ones.  And since we do not ask our customers to write reviews and do not buy these reviews (this is contrary to our moral principles), as some of the ‚Äúcompetitors‚Äù do, receiving dozens of reviews in advertising topics during the month, our competitors use this ‚Äúweakness‚Äù with the purpose is to blacken our reputation in the event of the slightest misunderstanding with a client, or simply try to diminish our merits, put them in a bad light. <br><br>  <b>As a result, our advertising topics have often turned into ‚Äúdiscussions‚Äù, where the arguments of ‚Äúopponents‚Äù bordered on common sense.</b>  Since most of the clients didn‚Äôt even complain, but people who didn‚Äôt use our services at all.  However, we should also recognize that no one is perfect, everyone has mistakes in their work, we are not an exception, but attitude is much more important.  We never avoided responsibility and paid for our mistakes, where we were guilty - we recognized them, made compensations, even if they were not placed under an offer agreement.  We have never bought reviews and will not buy, have earned a sufficient amount of funds on other projects and our goal is not to ‚Äúsell something and no matter what, just to sell‚Äù, we work in order to always find magic solutions.  We are open to constructive criticism, but criticism must be constructive. <br><br>  That is why we want to draw attention to reviews from people with a reputation, and not bots and clones that are used by competitors.  Since, in particular, thanks to them, for many years now, competitors cannot undermine the credibility of us, because any ‚Äúarguments‚Äù completely dry up as soon as a comment is given by some of our clients, especially with a reputation of hundreds of thousands. <br><br>  <b>FEEDBACK FROM CUSTOMERS WITH REPUTATION</b> <br><br>  <a href="http://searchengines.guru/showthread.php%3Fp%3D14865377">http://searchengines.guru/showthread.php?p=14865377#post14865377</a> <br>  <a href="http://searchengines.guru/showthread.php%3Fp%3D14874718">http://searchengines.guru/showthread.php?p=14874718#post14874718</a> <br>  <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/ua-hosting/blog/317282/">https://habrahabr.ru/company/ua-hosting/blog/317282/#comment_9983586</a> <br>  <a href="http://searchengines.guru/showthread.php%3Fp%3D14900495">http://searchengines.guru/showthread.php?p=14900495#post14900495</a> <br>  <a href="http://searchengines.guru/showthread.php%3Fp%3D14908492">http://searchengines.guru/showthread.php?p=14908492#post14908492</a> <br>  <a href="http://searchengines.guru/showthread.php%3Fp%3D14957194">http://searchengines.guru/showthread.php?p=14957194#post14957194</a> <br><br>  So far we have not received a single critical response from customers who have used our new product - a <b>virtual server with dedicated drives, a full-fledged analogue of a dedicated server</b> , and hundreds of virtual machines are currently busy.
