Part 2</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Here is a continuation of the article <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/218435">"Why employees commit stupid acts and what to do about it."</a> <br>  <b>Brief background: there</b> was a difficult project, there were a lot of mistakes and inconsistent actions of employees on it.  After several trials and errors, two documents came into being that describe the work expectations of both employees and managers.  Read more <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/218435/">here</a> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/17e/769/873/17e7698736e1f749b808b24b32e5dcf2.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  I confess, I have long been afraid to lay out the second document.  In the first article I already received a few critical comments, ranging from the fact that this is micromanagement and bureaucracy to the fact that "I would not want to work for you."

      But now I expect a flurry of emotions over comments and comparisons with various characters, even Goebbels.  I hope all the same this will not happen.  So, "Company Standards" IT companies. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  A small digression before you read "Company Standards": <br><ol><li>  All the proposed documents - this is not the dictatorship of one leader in the company.  Certainly the initiative was from him.  But all employees took part in the discussion.  If this initiative met with fierce rejection, then the document would go to the basket.  By the way, some of the points were dropped. </li><li>  This is not a sect, this is not the hymns in the morning sellers of Kirby vacuum cleaners, or propaganda.  This is the mutual obligations of adults and smart people fixed on paper.  Some form of collective agreement and all, including the head, adhere to these norms. </li><li>  This is by no means a ‚Äúsilver bullet‚Äù or a panacea.  This is just one of the approaches that worked in specific conditions. </li><li>  If you think that this will be useful in your work - use it (for non-commercial purposes, do not need to do this training and webinars).  One request - if possible, shares the results.  It is possible through lichku, or in the comments. </li><li>  Separately, stop on the observation that such documents limit creativity.  In my opinion it is not.  Any structure, whether it is unwritten rules or regulations, on the one hand limits us, on the other hand allows us to use our strong systemic qualities to achieve a result.  This is called the "paradox of structure."  These are not my thoughts, I rely on the materials of the course ‚ÄúCreativity, Innovation, and Change‚Äù (week 2) on Coursera.  If there is interest, then I can write a more detailed article on this. </li></ol><br><h2>  Company standards </h2><br>  <i>Retreat:</i> <i><br></i>  <i>I honestly copied a part of the principles below, a part was written by my employees, a part was written by me.</i>  <i>I don't remember where they came from.</i>  <i>If you find your thoughts, let me put the links below.</i> <br><br>  <b>Annotation:</b> <br>  During operation, you may encounter difficult situations when you need to make decisions that are not described in the instructions.  The company hopes that you will commit an act in such a situation and will follow the following corporate standards.  They are followed by everyone in our company, they form the basis of our corporate culture and therefore are called corporate standards. <br><br>  We know that following general agreements protects and develops our business, unites our company into one large family and enables our present families to become richer and we ourselves enjoy work. <br>  Violation of general agreements deprives us of this. <br><h3>  Principles </h3><br>  All of the following company standards are reduced to 4 simple principles: <br><ul><li>  Principle I. Everything is good, which leads to simplification. (Of course, without sacrificing quality.) So, it‚Äôs one thing ‚Äúto save the file,‚Äù and another ‚Äúto save the file so that a colleague can find it.‚Äù  If you simplify (work for a colleague, purchase for a Client, etc.), you are right. </li><li>  Principle II.  If in solving complex issues you calmly follow the procedures and company standards, and not emotions and resentment - you are right. </li><li>  Principle III.  If what you do protects the company - you are right. </li><li>  Principle IV.  If you do more than what was expected of you - you are right. </li></ul><br>  All company standards are set out in the first person, and if you agree with this, you must sign this, and if you do not agree, offer a reasonable improvement or leave the company. <br><br><h3>  Corporate standard 1 </h3><br>  I find it indecent to complicate the work.  I do everything to make the work of my colleagues easier. <br>  I do everything to make any function more technological and doable.  I know that the deliberate complication of well-known and simple functions will cause a sense of psychological discomfort and suspicion among colleagues.  And this is unacceptable. <br>  In a situation of uncertainty, I make a decision that simplifies the work of my colleagues as much as possible. <br>  I hope that my colleagues do the same. <br><br><h3>  Corporate standard 2 </h3><br>  I try to make my work transmitted, and the result of my work is reproducible in my absence.  If this does not happen, then this means that the work is done poorly.  Either the work is not finished yet. <br>  In a situation of uncertainty, I make such a decision, which makes possible the reproducibility of the result in my absence. <br>  I hope that my colleagues do the same. <br><br><h3>  Corporate standard 3 </h3><br>  I know that any errands are made ‚Äúday to day.‚Äù  If this is not possible, then I should call my colleague, manager or client in advance and inform him that they remember him. <br>  I am sure that my colleagues do the same. <br><br><h3>  Corporate standard 4 </h3><br>  When I work in a team, I understand that, for example, 10:00 = 10:00, and not 10:15 and not 11:00.  I understand that the general agreement organizes not only my time, but also the time of my colleagues, and the violation of my agreement disorganizes not only me, but also colleagues who are not to blame for this.  In the case of various overlays, I always call and warn colleagues in advance. <br>  I hope that my colleagues do the same. <br><br><h3>  Corporate standard 5 </h3><br>  I always plan my work and coordinate my plans with colleagues.  And I always schedule and announce in advance the interim results of my work.  I always show interim results on time. <br>  I hope that my colleagues do the same. <br><br><h3>  Corporate standard 6 </h3><br>  I know what imitation activity is.  This is when instead of what should be done, I do what I want.  Either instead of what is needed, I am doing another, psychologically more pleasant and lazy job. <br>  For example: <br><ul><li>  instead of communicating with the Client, in a thousand the first time I drag the box; </li><li>  instead of developing an information system, talking about the advantages / disadvantages of other systems; </li><li>  instead of developing a difficult project, ‚Äúcommunicating with partners‚Äù; </li><li>  instead of writing an article, I format it; </li><li>  instead of calling Customers, I draw a beautiful chart in the report ... etc.  etc. </li></ul><br>  I am able to distinguish activity from its imitation and I will not shy away from really productive work. <br>  I hope that my colleagues do the same. <br><br><h3>  Corporate standard 7 </h3><br>  I know that the question: ‚ÄúWill it be done or not?‚Äù To answer: ‚ÄúI will try‚Äù is indecent.  I never answer that way.  To such questions, I answer either "Yes" or "No."  I also know that the expressions listed below are prohibited to use, and accordingly I do not use them: <br>  "The first time I've heard". <br>  "Called, did not get through." <br>  "I came, but you (him, her, their ...) were not there." <br>  "I searched, but did not find." <br>  "And I thought ...". ‚Äù <br>  ‚ÄúThis is the fault of colleagues (Clients, administration, incorrect / missing documents, government bodies, etc.)‚Äù. <br>  "It was even before that (before me, then ...)". <br>  "And I said (warned, did ...)". <br>  "And nobody told me." <br>  "Why me?". <br>  "I have not heard." <br>  "I do not know". <br>  "Did not pass." <br>  "This is not for me, this is in the department ...‚Äù. <br>  "I wanted to, but it didn't work out." <br>  "I said, but he (she) did not." <br>  "I was not at this time, it seems that I was sick (I was on vacation, drunk, etc.)." <br>  I hope that my colleagues do the same. <br><br><h3>  Corporate standard 8 </h3><br>  I consider it indecent to discuss, hush up and conceal problems (interpersonal, organizational, etc.) or discuss them on the sly (including with colleagues), and not to pronounce them specifically and out loud.  All problems cannot be solved, but any of them can be turned into a task - a source of new ideas. <br><br>  I work according to the principle: problem - pro-contract - task - solution.  I know that a different way of dealing with problems ‚Äî regardless of my will ‚Äî is evolving into gossip.  Therefore, I consider it improper to treat my colleagues in a different way. <br>  I hope that my colleagues do the same. <br><br><h3>  Corporate standard 9 </h3><br>  I will never say anything bad about my company to strangers, but I will discuss the problem with the manager. <br>  I hope that my colleagues do the same. <br><br><h3>  Corporate standard 10 </h3><br>  I know about the three dangers that await every person: envy, jealousy, and laziness.  To protect myself from them, I constantly communicate with my colleagues, work with them and bear responsibility if I let them down.  I am open to communication and regularly share the results. <br>  I hope that my colleagues do the same. <br><br><h3>  Corporate standard 11 </h3><br>  Before making a complaint to someone, I first ask myself three control questions: <br><ol><li>  What is the VALID essence of the claim-problem? </li><li>  What did I not do to solve the problem? </li><li>  What is really and who is invited to do to solve the problem? </li></ol><br>  Then I will answer the questions in writing and postpone the answers for two days.  Before notifying others, carefully read the paragraph "a".  If the claim does not disappear, I will fulfill everything that depends on me according to paragraph ‚Äúb‚Äù;  if the complaint does not disappear again, I will rewrite paragraph ‚Äúc‚Äù in the form of a list of tasks and proposed solutions, as well as an understandable implementation plan. <br>  I know that there is no other way to complain to the company, and I hope that my colleagues do the same. <br><br><h3>  Corporate standard 12 </h3><br>  The best thing I can do for colleagues in difficult situations is to help, without reproach.  The best thing I can do when I get into a difficult situation is to ask my colleagues for help, without reproaching for refusing. <br>  I hope that my colleagues do the same. <br><br><h3>  Corporate standard 13 </h3><br>  I understand that any communication with the outside world is an advertisement of the company.  For advertising and the image of the company are all responsible.  With this in mind, I try to turn every actual and potential Client into a free advertising agent. <br><br><h3>  Corporate standard 14 </h3><br>  I boldly take on a new and unfamiliar business and I am not afraid to appear weak and incompetent.  I know that I can always ask for help from my colleagues. <br>  I hope that my colleagues do the same. <br><br><h3>  Corporate standard 15 </h3><br>  I understand that I do not have the right to enter into business negotiations on business issues that are not within my area of ‚Äã‚Äãcompetence, with anyone else (including acquaintances), without first informing my supervisor.  The word "pre" in this standard is key!  If I receive an offer from the outside and I am not able to pre-report on the upcoming contact, I will inform about the offer on the same day when I received it. <br>  I hope that my colleagues do the same. <br><br><h3>  Corporate standard 16 </h3><br>  In the case of a proposal to me personally, commission from any organization or private person, I immediately politely stop the relevant negotiations and report the received proposal to my manager.  Thus, the responsibility for further contacts with the relevant organization and / or private person is transferred by me to the management, who can take appropriate measures. <br><br>  If I find out that this standard is not fulfilled by my subordinates, I will take steps to dismiss this subordinate (without justification). <br><br>  I understand that my supervisor has the same rights regarding me. <br>  I hope that all colleagues do the same. <br><br><h3>  Corporate standard 17 </h3><br>  If any representative of any state organization appears in the office (phone call) with any question, I immediately politely send (switch) the corresponding representative to my supervisor, I do not conduct any conversations with him and answer all questions: ‚ÄúPlease, this is to my leadership. <br>  I hope that my colleagues do the same. <br><br><h3>  Corporate standard 18 </h3><br>  I know that the company standards listed here can be changed (canceled, improved ...) no more than once a year.  At the same time, the corresponding changes (justifications) must be prepared in writing by their initiator. <br><br><h3>  Corporate standard 19 </h3><br>  If I know about the existence of production problems, even those that are not within my competence, then I will definitely report them to my supervisor. <br>  I hope that my colleagues do the same. <br><br><h3>  Corporate standard 20 </h3><br>  If I figure out a way to break these standards without breaking them, the Company has the right to ask me: ‚ÄúWhy did you look for such a way?‚Äù <br><br><h2>  What it all led to </h2><br>  The reaction of the team to these documents, to put it mildly, was ambiguous.  I can immediately say that there was not a single person who, after the first reading, came and said, ‚ÄúThis is what you need!  Thank.  Now I will always carry your photo in my wallet, next to my daughter and wife. ‚Äù  Even my director said: ‚ÄúYes, this is a bust!‚Äù. <br><br>  People gathered in groups, discussed something, waved their hands.  The document could be discussed both anonymously (it was posted on the wiki) and through email feedback.  The people raged.  Employees who were more active and represented certain companies of colleagues and friends came to me several times.  We got together and discussed point by point. A part of the points was thrown away, part was reformulated. <br><br>  After more or less there was a version that suited everyone I sent to everyone by mail and offered to follow these rules.  We did not begin to subscribe to the ‚ÄúFirm Standards‚Äù document and did not dismiss anyone for refusing to sign. <br><br>  After that, the persecution of the manual went on, checking for lice.  do they themselves believe in what they have written or not?  It was especially popular to publicly catch the boss on anything that was not consistent with the ‚ÄúFirm Standards‚Äù.  But gradually, all these jokes somehow became spread to other employees.  I am not a psychologist and I can not give a mark on it correctly or not.  But it worked.  Not immediately, of course, but it worked. <br><br>  After about a month, the total number of jambs on the project and conflicts decreased.  I can not say how much it is in%, I remember only that I began to appear at home earlier and get less tired.  The relationship between employees also changed for the better, shifting each other problems and shoals became less. <br><br>  Perhaps all of this played time - we just worked together, maybe some part was contributed by joint work on these documents, or the documents themselves ‚Äî I don‚Äôt know. <br><br>  In fairness it should be noted that the documents appeared with a certain temporary gap.  First, ‚ÄúFirm Standards‚Äù, then ‚ÄúPrinciples of Management‚Äù. <br><br><h2>  findings </h2><br>  What conclusions did I draw for myself: <br><br>  <b>The most important conclusion:</b> If you yourself are not ready to adhere to these standards, do not start.  You should not listen to the subordinate only once, dismiss the problem and that's it - your trust in you will be lost.  As with all your initiatives. <br><br>  1. If you enter any standards of behavior in the company, then all without exception must adhere to them. <br>  2. All standards of conduct should be discussed jointly and jointly adopted. <br>  3. Your expectations and the expectations of your employees are better voiced than biting your elbows, that you did not understand each other. <br>  4. If a team is already solid, works with each other for several years and shows results, then there is no need to impose external standards of behavior unless absolutely necessary.  Do not break what works. <br><br>  I would appreciate if you leave your opinion or just share your experience. <br><br>  PS He promised to give links to the finished files.  They now have a lot of different corporate paraphernalia - I still lack motivation to clean it all up.  The meaning is identical with the text of the articles. Take from there.  No offense, okay? </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/218857/">https://habr.com/ru/post/218857/</a></p>
