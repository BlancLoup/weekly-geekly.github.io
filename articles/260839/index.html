It was fun! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/99a/95f/fb8/99a95ffb8cf74b3a87e707ccda9d217b.jpg"><br><br>  This time we visited all 7 pavilions, and therefore one part, along with gifs, weighs almost 50 megabytes. <br>  Comrade!  Be careful with the traffic going under the cat!

      This is the second part of the article.  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/madrobots/blog/259261/">Read the first part here.</a> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  So, we continue. <br>  In the process of metal processing, waste arises - metal shavings and spent coolant.  And for this and for the other, there are solutions - compactors for chips: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/be8/374/fef/be8374fefb394e1c9eadfc47b0477baf.jpg"><br>  Which make it such nice metal pills: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e9c/a4b/a49/e9ca4ba49e914f0db1b20dc7a453e058.jpg"><br>  And liquid cleaning stations that allow you to reuse water from anything, rather than waste it: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b64/464/c47/b64464c475724ad495de19501feb5867.jpg"><br>  You can also reduce the amount of waste - for example, using an airborne lubricant: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e59/05f/c9d/e5905fc9d92c4858a2987952bd54bb59.jpg"><br>  This automatic machine mixes oil with air and, under pressure, supplies it to the processing site, seriously reducing oil consumption and improves cooling. <br>  But a fun simple mechanism that serves to collect oil films from the emulsion surface: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/076/688/135/0766881358424e349dc41a89dba44061.jpg"><br>  It is based on the fact that a cloth glued into a ring, slightly wetted with water, but well - with oil, is continuously pulled through the emulsion.  When the canvas passes through the layer of oil, it sticks to the surface, and at the top it collects from it with a sharp edge and flows by gravity into the oil compartment.  Simple and elegant. <br><br>  Now let's talk not about cutting, but about the connection of metal.  For example, about welding.  Here, for example, automatic machine for pipe welding: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e62/b4b/8a0/e62b4b8a097541e288af4ae8f5ed9b0e.jpg"><br>  How to cut the pipe, I already showed you.  And this is how they are welded: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/387/0f4/a8c/3870f4a8c50c4e42a2a632d11c3bfe5f.jpg"><br><br>  If the pipe is so large that there is no possibility to locate the machine around it, or if it is not a pipe, but just a curved part, then the Sunrise automatic welding kit comes to the rescue: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/0a7/00e/b8f/0a700eb8fb224fffb7d4114fefd6735b.jpg"><br>  It is attached to the surface with magnets (or with the help of vacuum suction pads for non-magnetic materials): <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b2d/bd0/7a5/b2dbd07a5b304dd2905bb7654302dfe5.jpg"><br>  And absolutely automatically (including transverse movement along the seam and axial oscillations of the burner) welds two parts: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/295/fa9/15f/295fa915fce049368c4667e0f070403e.jpg"><br>  It turns out such a beautiful seam: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/2a8/c7c/70d/2a8c7c70df364a6993f32d7d3561faed.jpg"><br><br>  Of course, automatic welding machines were also shown: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/090/00b/38b/09000b38beec441c959a78ca71907693.jpg"><br>  For example, these can boil almost any metal in any gas mixture: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/9f1/80a/176/9f180a176fcb4db881f8d220c1f436fb.jpg"><br>  And this welder can weld bolts and nuts to metal surfaces: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/48b/f3b/232/48bf3b23257041bca491cfe41a7e72b4.jpg"><br>  A special bolt is inserted into the working head (it is distinguished by an almost total absence of a cap and some kind of special coating): <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/77e/c90/3ce/77ec903ce7e347f9967f2511a52534c9.jpg"><br>  The tool is pressed against the metal sheet and the button is pressed: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/25e/b71/a22/25eb71a22acb4eb1b83a47247f33ccae.gif"><br>  Here you can see what happened as a result: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/6b9/56f/5a5/6b956f5a50f2429a8c2a75f20fdc38c8.jpg"><br><br>  This is a device for proper sharpening of electrodes for argon-arc welding: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/4ed/30a/22f/4ed30a22f73b4414a9c46f50d2849a68.jpg"><br>  If amateurs get along with a screwdriver and a Dremel, then professionals use special devices in which the electrode is always sharpened at the right angle. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/4b5/fca/bd3/4b5fcabd33e74ae596d6d3d233641037.jpg"><br><br>  If a part is really a complex shape, then automatic welding is performed using one or several manipulators: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/394/7c3/e52/3947c3e52bf5409b84fd380aefddbb9e.gif"><br>  In general, manipulators can do a variety of things.  Turn over parts: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/7d4/7e9/29d/7d47e929d7674a849f2a3e91799c7c14.gif"><br>  Serve them: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/255/15d/c46/25515dc46b1b45809a49953a58d72b8c.gif"><br>  Download to machine: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/3ec/21e/d73/3ec21ed7321d4e1e8871266b9636d964.gif"><br>  To mill complex shapes: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/7fa/99d/ed5/7fa99ded5df441fd8a4f8690cd994e95.gif"><br>  To play air hockey: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/1c3/500/271/1c350027180d4c838d30232421ee77be.gif"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b8c/f5b/aa0/b8cf5baa03b5402195e5b4cab39ec2da.gif"><br>  Pretend mime (you can watch the video <a href="https://instagram.com/p/3RaQ73MU7z/">here</a> (by the way, <a href="https://instagram.com/vvz_vlad/">subscribe</a> ): <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/623/526/12d/62352612dc1c4c0690aa9c2c98ec8b68.gif"><br>  And even sort the details: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b88/4a3/ebd/b884a3ebdf914e06b190e2ef86ad25ac.gif"><br>  Here is the thing that puffs red - the camera, with the help of which the robot understands which side has the part turned to it, and depending on it puts it on one or the other side.  Another camera with a special laser illuminator is located at the top - it is needed to determine the position of the piled parts, so that the robot can grab it correctly. <br><br>  Another very interesting development of the same company is ‚ÄúHigh-speed robotic cell for sorting by color‚Äù: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/7a4/140/a67/7a4140a67ae64b2c9174433d45dc704b.jpg"><br>  It represents such a cute yellow machine that can automatically automatically identify objects of different colors on the working field and sort them according to color, and do it at a speed inaccessible to humans: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/91f/722/3c6/91f7223c60b84212a41a2afa356a903c.jpg"><br>  Once, once, once and ready: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ade/7f9/691/ade7f969195f44df8cc71ae62c267d0e.gif"><br>  In fact, he does it faster than on the gif.  The real speed can be seen <a href="https://instagram.com/p/3O31c8sU57/">here</a> (by the way, <a href="https://instagram.com/vvz_vlad/">subscribe</a> ). <br>  It clings and carries objects with vacuum suction cups: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a9d/05b/943/a9d05b94312b4a5fb25a231ab7a8c71b.jpg"><br>  After all three colors are sorted by jars, the robot overturns them back to the working field and everything starts anew: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/865/0d7/60f/8650d760fbf846aaa654cc22373a5a73.gif"><br>  You can watch forever. <br><br>  KUKA brought a friendly roboruku, around which there are no signs forbidding to approach it: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/986/431/047/986431047abd4e67b8c1a351e29055e6.jpg"><br>  And the thing is that she somehow knows how to determine what is being prevented from working and stopping her movement.  It looks pretty impressive - the dude comes up to the hand moving at full speed, it bumps into his shoulder and ... nothing happens - the push turns out to be sensitive, but not even knocking him down: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/15f/f72/d72/15ff72d7220f4dd889912edef24236ec.jpg"><br><br>  Some companies did not bring their machines at all. They did not bring them to the exhibition: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/187/258/c3d/187258c3d39249ebba19fa5b22a5c913.jpg"><br>  Why all?  Because only the products of these machines fit the stand, and the machines themselves would have to be left outside: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/88a/4cb/c1f/88a4cbc1fe674127b2bf8d67c15d4489.jpg"><br><br>  At other companies, the products still got on the stand, albeit with a small creak: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c69/3f0/e93/c693f0e938634d028c34efe32b5cf99f.jpg"><br>  I believe that they had to shorten the name and call the car "Sarapulka": <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f00/851/7c2/f008517c25724961866f58d8d080899e.jpg"><br><br>  Many exhibits were intended for post-processing of metal parts.  For example, such a tricky abrasive joke for grinding teeth with very high accuracy: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/0cc/007/7d3/0cc0077d343d44dc8a0a60ab1e8d6250.jpg"><br>  The whole trick is that the entire surface of the spiral passes through each section being processed, and the abrasive also wears from the very beginning, and the last sections (and especially the final section consisting of a thinner abrasive) retain their geometry much longer, providing the same correct geometry of the workpiece. <br>  Or here is such a nice brush for steel pipes, cleaning the burrs and traces of processing: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/59b/b5b/22b/59bb5b22be414344bc9a33a21331d17f.jpg"><br>  With such a serious booklet telling about him so much that I want to buy it right here at the exhibition. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/4aa/26c/9b0/4aa26c9b07834be9b4e9b604ee7d2dbb.jpg"><br>  But some companies are creative in displaying their product range: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/4a4/9ef/6ae/4a49ef6ae84b45d2904decfa2d4cc7e5.jpg"><br>  But enough about the colors.  Quite a common task - the processing of metal parts with a complex surface to shine.  Or not to shine, but simply remove the burrs and dirt.  Of course, you can put a person with GOI paste and a toothbrush (or a file) next to it, but this is a rather expensive method that you can seriously apply, perhaps, only in the army and prison.  Correct posony use <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2593%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BB%25D1%2582%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B0">tumbling</a> .  The part is loaded into a special drum full of abrasive particles, after which the engine is turned on, which mixes this mass with vibration: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b5c/d28/e5a/b5cd28e5ad0e468fbd2d809437ffd184.gif"><br>  Absolutely sticky sight.  The abrasives themselves (they are called tumbling bodies) come in completely different shapes and sizes ‚Äî the choice depends on the desired degree of processing, the surface and material of the part, and many other factors: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/2d4/611/0c2/2d46110c288a4e3c9399d11741e4f46c.jpg"><br>  Large sizes are used to smooth the surface, small - for finer polishing: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/810/7e3/9fa/8107e39fa5a44ef9b0b63356e6d701ec.jpg"><br>  For example, like this: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e49/2cb/402/e492cb402d924329bb3d9ca335373d48.gif"><br>  Here you can see the difference between the parts before and after processing (in the center is the intermediate stage): <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/429/d3b/c75/429d3bc75ab645e982625ceb40f26637.jpg"><br><br>  Returning to the topic of lasers, one can say that they are capable of not only cutting metal, but also making more subtle work.  For example, a relief that is difficult to achieve by milling: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/7e4/761/d19/7e4761d191bb4f4ea9028a6672c4e091.jpg"><br>  This machine does this: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/287/490/7bc/2874907bceb44d5e87a2eb2c7856944f.jpg"><br>  Another, similar, can quickly apply labels: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/518/383/d55/518383d55d294c1790a7a2885a8887ab.jpg"><br>  Once and plaque marked: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/fc4/c8a/f7a/fc4c8af7afb5413b9d858090b4ff43e3.gif"><br>  Or not a plate, but the back cover of the phone: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a7e/c1a/375/a7ec1a3753914e939fbd6c673a46ff5a.jpg"><br>  Or do not waste your time on vulgar drawing on the phones, but do something more useful, such as stents for vascular surgery.  Pay attention to the match for the scale and estimate the size of this piece: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/553/ac5/448/553ac544881f463bbc81c8a43c85ab15.jpg"><br>  Separately, I would like to note ‚ÄúMinimarker‚Äù: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/2ac/e59/895/2ace59895f654ee1a31500276cea940d.jpg"><br>  Due to cunning technology, they are able to form a color image on the metal (though not at all): <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ef8/39e/d54/ef839ed541364afe9523e3e0d15c6eb8.jpg"><br>  And the mobile version (such a red gun in the center of the frame) is intended for marking with code or inscriptions of large parts in production: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/36b/ea3/ce2/36bea3ce25ea498090076ca4cb18de72.jpg"><br>  It looks like this: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/fb1/312/bde/fb1312bdeb754f7fa5406038eae02e0f.jpg"><br>  Unlike other types of marking, this method does not require consumables, it is very fast and very durable. <br><br>  Another way of marking is cheaper - shock-point marking, which, by the principle of operation, resembles a dot-matrix printer, only beats with needles not on the painting ribbon, but on the part itself or on the type plate.  The very ‚Äúneedle‚Äù looks like this: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/988/c5a/3ce/988c5a3ce34844a98e7e6c20cb99d9db.jpg"><br>  This is how the marker itself: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/235/b6b/48c/235b6b48c47942a08a74bbccaca2848c.jpg"><br>  And so the control panel for him: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/09a/dd1/7fe/09add17feca34de183bc9a9aa2250e3b.jpg"><br>  Using the control panel, enter the desired text, the marker is pressed against the details ... <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/bf6/1a0/560/bf61a0560de94d0ca2fd28c8e373051e.gif"><br>  Done: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ded/d2d/120/dedd2d12074f4a3794d00c48b820699e.jpg"><br>  Head drive - pneumatic or electromagnetic.  Pneumatic is more powerful, but requires a compressor in the immediate vicinity. <br><br>  Another interesting technology is the spraying of metal powder using its acceleration to very high speeds with the help of such a thing (also, by the way, our production): <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/098/c21/7ee/098c217eee2b484d81b99f1700776d4c.jpg"><br>  Take a metal plate: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/8d2/1ef/3c1/8d21ef3c1b3d4df4ac4adf5f66b835b6.jpg"><br>  A nozzle is sent to it, and the button is pressed: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/bca/005/7cc/bca0057cc414462b9004ebf2f7753ce7.gif"><br>  And oops, in a few seconds a hillock of metal grows: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/6b5/a03/06c/6b5a0306cdee4a3db40acd7a15079f67.jpg"><br>  Of course, the hardness of the metal applied in this way is much lower than that of, for example, welded metal, but this method is simple, fast, does not require post-processing, and provides tightness, which is often sufficient. <br>  A big plus is that you do not necessarily need a metal substrate - metal particles accelerate to such a speed that they stick to anything - from glass to plastic.  Here, for example, conductive tires on glass: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d9f/6c5/11a/d9f6c511a8e04f70b6628c8be84f9d89.jpg"><br>  Moreover, two-component - the first coating with aluminum, and the second - with copper.  Specifically, in this case, they are needed to connect to a transparent coating on glass, to which it is quite difficult to ensure good contact by conventional means ‚Äî one has to use long pressure contacts or conductive glue.  And you can simply solder to a copper coating or cuddle at one point - the low resistance of the metal allows. <br><br>  Another Russian company produces a compact spectrometer to determine the composition of the metal.  And it is really small - it fits easily on a small trolley: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/98e/e9e/2ec/98ee9e2ec718495b93adc1bacdcd4d86.jpg"><br>  I did not even regret the blade of my multitool (Leatherman Squirt ES4) to look at the process.  It looks like this.  First, the sample is cleaned with sandpaper: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/076/8c8/274/0768c8274df74392b86bf8cac447cd07.jpg"><br>  Then tightly pressed against the working chamber: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/cf6/a98/ce0/cf6a98ce0e7e4532981b6562ad220c61.jpg"><br>  Due to the small width of the blade I had to go for some tricks: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/cdf/3d5/8c1/cdf3d58c1d1c420a8e3d2a488d7e9061.jpg"><br>  Turns on the gas supply: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/fdd/411/e82/fdd411e8206c43499de1f097b2c09399.jpg"><br>  And the magic happens: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/2d7/bf7/3a8/2d7bf73a8de3419f8592d6d5af62a7aa.gif"><br>  Just kidding  In fact, the magic does not occur - solid physics.  The electrode in the working chamber hammer the sample with pulses, creating an arc that tears off the metal particles, causing them to evaporate, and the metal atoms to become excited.  In such a state, they cannot stay for a long time, after a short time turning into a normal state, but emitting photons, which are recorded by the CCD.  The energy of the emitted photons for each metal is different, which means that you can see how many samples a particular metal has by how many photons each wavelength is caught by the matrix.  The spectrum graphically looks like this: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/cfe/c61/432/cfec61432501e826eeb905d074420e0d.png" alt="image"><br>  You can read more, for example <a href="http://www.iskroline.ru/articles/atomic-emission-spectroscopy-principles/">here</a> . <br>  And here are the results of the analysis of the alloy from which the blade is made: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/6a8/aed/ed0/6a8aeded0b194d6890753ee98a37372e.jpg"><br>  0.4% carbon, 13% chromium, silicon, nickel, tungsten, molybdenum ... The program automatically tries to choose the most suitable steel grade, in this case it is 4013 according to the Russian classification: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/5f8/195/674/5f8195674af0486aa5dd244c0c25e45b.jpg"><br><br>  Finally, I'll show you some interesting devices.  For example, a scanner that can accurately determine the dimensions of a part: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d0b/8d6/f0e/d0b8d6f0e63144029c7c869bd263a4f5.jpg"><br>  It is enough to put it on the desktop: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/9da/3d1/594/9da3d1594a7b41cc80d5586b27871021.jpg"><br>  Or profile meter, which with great accuracy determines the amount of roughness of the part: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/9da/3d1/594/9da3d1594a7b41cc80d5586b27871021.jpg"><br>  And displays a graph similar to a cardiogram: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f74/a17/d1f/f74a17d1fd2a46629d7a3791f789128c.jpg"><br><br>  That's all.  Good luck in the metalwork, see you next year! <br><br> <a href="https://twitter.com/MadrobotsRu"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ac1/fc6/d2a/ac1fc6d2a19948c59791b0da6ab659df.gif"></a> <a href="http://vk.com/madrobots"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/933/ac3/0b6/933ac30b6fd24ffd82218148c2fb0917.gif"></a> <a href="http://instagram.com/madrobotsru"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/464/a82/e04/464a82e045a34bae81406fd0b640cf08.gif"></a> <a href="http://facebook.com/madrobotsrussia"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/0b5/542/136/0b55421365064901acdf0ed58cc4a111.gif"></a> <br> <a href="http://madrobots.ru/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/63d/405/78e/63d40578ecbf48f28c62f57705c73eb6.gif"></a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/260839/">https://habr.com/ru/post/260839/</a></p>
