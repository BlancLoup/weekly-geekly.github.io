As necessary and not necessary</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  During my short professional career I had to deal with various equipment and various networks.  And what sometimes had to be seen, plunged into silent horror.  Installation is often carried out by anyone and how horrible in violation of all possible standards and regulations.  I am glad that in most cases it is still not the case and the Jamshut montage does not roll. <br>  The article will be interesting to installers (although I think there are no irresponsible people at Habr√©, or at least their number is minimal), people leading this process, accepting work and generally those who are not indifferent to the realities of Russian telecom (generally speaking, this applies not only to to telecom). <br>  Under the cut a voluminous article, a lot of photos of how it is not necessary and a bit of how it should be. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  I thought for a long time whether such an article is needed on Habr√© ‚Äî everyone decides for himself what standards to adhere to, and if he doesn‚Äôt decide, then decide for him and he will have to redo it.  That is, I assume the consciousness of customers and performers.  But in fact, you can see for yourself in what condition the modern networks can be. <br><br>  Remembering my <a href="http://eucariot.habrahabr.ru/blog/78357/">promise to</a> try to improve at least something in my environment, I decided to accumulate here some tips and examples. <br><br><h4>  Let's start with the bad </h4><br>
<h5>  This is how the grounding of the feeder of one of the OpSoSov was done: </h5><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/a9e/30a/500/a9e30a500a8eb08547afd5cbd2b9c641.jpg"></a>

      It is possible, of course, that the cable is so attached, just so that it does not hang out.  But this is not an excuse - you need to remove the excess. <br><br><h5>  At 10 meters from this picture: </h5><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/c9f/d58/5d1/c9fd585d1a9b216e23eebfd63468fdb3.jpg"></a> <br><br>  In general, the mess and chaos, on the right hangs a skein of trimmed feeder.  Similarly: it turned out to be unnecessary: ‚Äã‚Äãcut off and thrown. <br><br><h5>  This is also the case with grounding: </h5><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/ca5/541/ea3/ca5541ea3f54e6f9176e46d9a298f7a0.jpg"></a> <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/443/d77/98c/443d7798cf38dec616693daa3922c1b2.jpg"></a> <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/ee6/55a/3f2/ee655a3f24494ab274d0b9bcea76410d.jpg"></a> <br><br>  Rings on the ground cable are undesirable.  The fact is that in this case a primitive electromagnetic coil is obtained.  Since I am not an electrician, I will not be able to elaborate on this issue.  If there are specialists among the readers, I will add information on this issue. <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/a99/182/4ff/a991824ff9c148ce656a12082c8e6069.jpg"></a> <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/0b2/13c/426/0b213c4267c290d456b04a88a38dea0a.jpg"></a> <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/a50/b37/a94/a50b37a949946da149ccc96e09b1f0de.jpg"></a> <br><br>  One grounding bolt is designed to fix a single grounding cable.  Often you have to deal with situations when several cables are mounted on one bolt.  It is not clear whether this is done in order to save money or because of the laziness of the contractor, but this should not be allowed. <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/ffb/e1b/39f/ffbe1b39fbe66a714bb6cade410691fd.jpg"></a> <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/84a/106/7c2/84a1067c20cead73d5d6c9d79b3a0822.jpg"></a> <br><br>  What is the use of such grounding?  If even now there is an electrical connection between the two parts, then its preservation cannot be guaranteed in the future: rain, temperature drops, fogs do not benefit such compounds. <br><br><h5>  Examples of the lack of a sense of beauty in installers: </h5><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/ed5/86d/380/ed586d3807b49a2d52b16baf54861e46.jpg"></a> <br><br>  Uncut strap  The work looks vulgar and directly indicates the level of professionalism of installers.  Often there is also a situation when strepy are trimmed carelessly and at the end of a sharp edge sticks out, which is very easy to cut. <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/6b1/03d/618/6b103d618b912e11b6c84b8b0bb4db2d.jpg"></a> <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/822/c63/844/822c638445cae299bcc3ad47b8cfc031.jpg"></a> <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/058/df5/19c/058df519c0d0853ddb412fad35d91b3f.jpg"></a> <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/858/cf5/ee9/858cf5ee92ce97f084d023c0f84f8eae.jpg"></a> <br><br>  If possible, all cables should be bent at right angles.  They should be laid on lederam (cable, cable routes) or in the box.  Simply attaching the cable to the wall is not kosher. <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/00d/821/2bf/00d8212bf0b655aef28c149d2bfa2181.jpg"></a> <br><br>  A very common drawback: the lack of heat shrinkable rubber in the field of cable crimping.  Nothing critical, but it's a move. <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/94c/2b0/b48/94c2b0b48a4beba4995b490a8d88890d.jpg"></a> <br><br>  The general style of work in Russia: I did mine, and the rest is not my concern.  Such broken walls, splinter plaster often remains after the work done.  As well as heaps of construction debris, pieces of cables, insulation, damaged terminals, trimming strepes.  Contractor should be forced to clean it after work.  This concerns, of course, not only telecommunications. <br><br><h5>  This is the result of dishonest contractor work. </h5><br>  Poor Leder paint: <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/22e/ee1/cce/22eee1cce88f4ace524af138ab010793.jpg"></a> <br><br>  After a few months, the paint peels off, corrosion appears.  Especially in the field of welding.  Unfortunately, it is difficult to verify this at acceptance. <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/535/1c8/64d/5351c864d27ca7ada29dd67f456ec881.jpg"></a> <br><br>  Or the use of Vtormet for the manufacture of metal structures.  Such pipes can have thin walls and, accordingly, can not withstand the load. <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/026/4d5/7bb/0264d57bb553d69e323ff161b010309e.jpg"></a> <br><br>  Often, when dismantling, workers go easy, such as cutting the feeder and leaving residues as is.  Firstly, it makes further installation difficult for others, and secondly, from such trifles there is a general mess in everything. <br><br><h6>  Unauthorized nuts </h6><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/fae/854/e8b/fae854e8bd04f35f32cfa417f6258dab.jpg"></a> <br><br>  This is generally a terrible evil.  Just imagine that this bolt holds a four hundred kilogram construction.  If it falls, then serious responsibility will fall on many.  Twice in my practice I have met with similar shortcomings. <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/f44/b33/326/f44b333265cf51a9e16475df1c555b1e.jpg"></a> <br><br>  In this photo, an implicit error, which in the spring can lead to sad consequences.  Pay attention to the metal box under the leder - this is also the cable route, it is protected from external influences.  And now pay attention to the visor on the building.  A falling icicle will easily kill the optics and greatly add hassle. <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/847/46c/5c6/84746c5c68a5a2d326b21dcba2e50403.jpg"></a> <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/067/5ef/71c/0675ef71c7d793d7bfe7ce509325bba4.jpg"></a> <br><br>  Not sealed areas of the feeder.  Moisture (rain, condensate) can get inside, and during frost, freezing, damage the core and the insulation. <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/6ce/b34/00b/6ceb3400b1bc8a964e20947e855ae836.jpg"></a> <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/cce/741/df1/cce741df1c69676a40ca1c9c6498bc8d.jpg"></a> <br><br>  The first photo shows the result of a poor development plan: the roof visor was not taken into account and the initial platform of the tower had to be increased, which could not have a positive impact on the strength of the structure. <br><br>  The second photo is an example of an erroneous calculation of the bearing capacity of the tower.  At the moment she is in disrepair. <br><br><h5>  And this is the twisted pair of the largest home provider of our city: </h5><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/e82/f27/38b/e82f2738b400b1ef57a3af99de85f3f7.jpg"></a> <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/af0/c96/928/af0c9692834bf1dd5b45e29cb774a83f.jpg"></a> <br><br>  And this is not the most successful shots.  And until recently, this situation was everywhere.  Up to the houses, there was a twisted pair length of several hundred meters, uncontrollable switches for 5 rubles per bundle, 100 subscribers per 10 megabit channel.  Fortunately, they now took up the aesthetics of their network, improved those.  support <br><br><h5>  Base station of one operator: </h5><br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/28e/548/7ee/28e5487ee9bc2edc2346b8886739a96a.jpg"></a> <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/82e/597/38a/82e59738a71a49d6825abd582086faae.jpg"></a> <br><br>  Focus on the plinths on the left and cable chaos in the rack. <br><br>  You can often see how on the switches, in the closets, on the walls they made a snake wedding.  Examples of this mass. <br><br>  Save for negative examples. <br><br><h4>  Now tips </h4><br>  To many, they seem obvious or strained, but remember for yourself how often you have to deal with their violation.  So, as it should be: <br><br>  1) Aesthetics.  Whatever you say, it is very important.  Of course, you only need to do this if everything else is in order.  This can also include cleanliness in the rooms. <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/7d2/548/f70/7d2548f70f3344ed6b15773a7562c559.jpg"></a> <br><br>  2) Stock.  The golden rule: do 25% of the stock for everything.  Do you make the SCS, do you pull the power cable, order the box and anything else - count the required amount and multiply by 1.25.  Even if you have your own company, no need to skimp, forget already the "economy should be economical."  It's a shame when you need to move the outlet, and the twisted pair is already stretched (by the way, no cables should go into tension) or when pulling power and not enough one and a half centimeters. <br>  It is not difficult to leave such a ring here, but if you move the pipe racks or raise the antenna, it will play a good service.  Or put the stock of the twisted pair in the box. <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/fac/fd2/3f8/facfd23f85c5b0303cef19a5c515823d.jpg"></a> <br><br>  3) Cables should not just go along the wall, hang, hang out.  They should be carried along the cable route one by one, fastening together with straps (ties).  Avoid crossing electrical signal and power cables. <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/481/982/18b/48198218b72294cec6ff69a335cedd07.jpg" alt="image"></a> <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/0d1/85e/d55/0d185ed55018ccf6e3d9413a41fecebe.jpg" alt="image"></a> <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/bf2/677/3cd/bf26773cd1a5aa30aafd55aa8114fa78.jpg" alt="image"></a> <br><br>  The company, where the photos were taken, is being renovated: beautiful flat walls of plasterboard, armstrong to the ceiling, lamps, fire alarms.  And what about the ceiling?  That's right, the same thing - why put it in order, if you still can not see. <br><br>  4) All cables, feeders, machines must be signed. <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/bd3/239/3cc/bd32393cc35f67c6b2fb4caa526ba500.jpg"></a> <br><br>  5) For patch panels and crosses, I advise you to have a table that should always be up to date.  For SCS, there must be a network diagram.  This and the previous paragraph will allow, in which case, quickly and unequivocally restore everything as it was.  For example, if you want to move the switch one unit up. <br><br>  6) <b>UPD:</b> Made-Fix (as prompted in the comments).  Do not leave at the end of the day / week / reporting period changes in all documents and journals, because it is forgotten. <br><br>  7) On important nodes (server, switch, base stations) you need to do emergency lighting from batteries and regularly check its performance.  If possible, the batteries must also be connected to a computer to control equipment in an emergency. <br><br>  8) Technical premises should at least be equipped with motion and fire sensors.  If there are dry contacts on the equipment and the monitoring system, it is better to connect the fire alarm outputs (POS) to it.  In our monitoring center we can see the opening of the door or an accident by temperature.  PIC pins are connected to the dry contacts of the Huawei BS. <br><br>  9) If you have equipment that requires maintenance, there should be a periodic maintenance schedule.  And it should be followed so that it does not work like this: <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/a36/7c4/a63/a367c4a63e1b5927ed7d0928e90c6570.jpg"></a> <br><br>  10) If you are a contractor, or accept work from him, if your work is related to installation, take photos of everything.  All the flaws, deficiencies, everything that was done wrong, everything needs to be photographed.  Firstly, you can visually show where the shoals are, or prove that you did everything qualitatively, and secondly, this will help avoid controversial issues: ‚ÄúThis was not the case.  It was so. ‚Äù  Photos need to be stored, then to show how to or should not be done.  We are our new installers or contractors, for example, we always drive around the objects and show what we will require of them. <br><br>  11) Before you begin serious work, you must have a plan of action, and everything is prepared for the beginning. <br><br>  12) 15 minutes before the end of the working day you need to start cleaning the room and workplace.  Sometimes it is better not to finish the work today, but to have time to put everything in order. <br><br>  13) "Nothing is more permanent than temporary."  In doing any work, do not think that it is for a while - do it right away well. <br><br>  14) Well, in general, treat your work responsibly, and find fault with those who do this work, because in the end you will have to exploit it later. <br><br>  Toward the close of a photo of almost perfect technical premises and installation: <br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/bc4/a26/5c6/bc4a265c603e73fff12d91b6b2e04c9a.jpg"></a> <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/c33/875/29d/c3387529d1513c20b16b34fbcc2da705.jpg"></a> <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/397/9a0/d22/3979a0d22f845d81b1b2e37ef7364286.jpg" alt="image"></a> <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/2a9/138/eb3/2a9138eb3119cabda6d403b36b20e289.jpg"></a> <br><br>  Photo mounting BS in China. <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/689/622/d56/689622d56662367f086193f7c6cfc77b.jpg"></a> <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/633/9e1/b4d/6339e1b4d802407cc6e3b77815cac327.jpg"></a> <br><br>  I can not change the situation with roads in our country, with education, bribes, the police.  But I can do my job qualitatively (it‚Äôs good for pleasure) and demand it from others. <br><br>  &lt;An article similar to this was some time ago published by me on <a href="http://www.nag.ru/">nag.ru.</a>  But since I want the essence of the article to become known to as many people as possible, supplemented and somewhat modified, I publish it here. <br>  Unfortunately, I understand that the topic will probably cause some discussion, approval, but in fact it is unlikely that it will change anything: the responsible will read and agree, the irresponsible will read and will forget&gt; </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/83364/">https://habr.com/ru/post/83364/</a></p>
