I'm bored to just work and just live.  I want to understand all the laws by which a person exists.  How and why he acts, is lazy, works, lies on the sofa, wants more, wants a beer or a cigarette, achieves success, leads people, etc. <br><br>  To understand this, I constantly experiment every day.  Over yourself, above colleagues, above you.  And then I draw conclusions. <br><br>  Although I am a biorobot, my memory is human, so I forget my own conclusions.  And if I have checked in practice on improving work efficiency and recognized several dozens of methods as successful, then there are a lot more of them on personal effectiveness.  But I forget them.

      <br>
      So I decided to write.  Inspired by the example of the samurai - if you read Hagakure, you will understand what I mean.  And if not read, then I will explain. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  In the days of the samurai, no one particularly wrote books, there was no such business.  But there were clans.  And in these clans there were clever people - people who achieved significant results.  These clever men, when they became old men, wrote down their wisdom on paper ‚Äî they produced some messages for the clan.  There was no Internet and no comments at that time, so there was no place to write ‚Äúfu, what the hell‚Äù, no one, no reason. <br><br>  I thought for a long time, what for whom I am writing this down.  After all, I am used to writing texts for people and trying to take their interests into account.  But there is one nuisance - no one, including me, digests the moralizing by.  No matter how useful the proposed method is, reception or observation, it will be rejected only because it came from outside. <br><br>  So I decided very simply - I will write it down for myself.  I will give advice to myself.  And learn from yourself.  And you are just a spectator, who stands aside and watches as one teaches the other.  Father son, brother brother, each other.  No matter.  It is important that you just stand and watch.  Nobody tells you anything.  Nobody asks you anything.  Nobody advises you anything.  Your opinion no one asks. <br><br>  You just stand and listen.  And what to do next - decide for yourself. <br><br>  Well, a warning. <br><br>  <i>Be careful - in this text I talk to myself.</i>  <i>Not with you!</i> <i><br></i>  <i>I am me.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>You are me in the past.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>He is me in the future.</i>  <i>Well, you too.</i> <i><br></i> <br><br><h4>  Probabilities </h4><br>  Let's talk a bit about probabilities? <br><br>  Do you think it will snow tomorrow?  The Internet says that the probability is 50%.  Is it snowing in summer?  During your short life the snow fell in the summer several times.  One day in late April, it piled so hard that you had a tummy car sitting in a snowdrift in the middle of a parking lot, and you had to leave it ‚Äî there were no shovels. <br><br>  You don't really care if it will snow tomorrow.  Does lung cancer bother you?  You do smoke, I know.  Periodically you hear about the terrible diseases that smoking brings with you.  After all, you realize that, sooner or later, these diseases will affect you, if you do not quit in time?  What thought goes through your head when you think about these diseases? <br><br>  I know which one: <i>I will be in time</i> .  I will have time to quit before the irreversible changes come.  Reduce the probability to zero. <br><br>  Well, in general, there are many stories about how people have smoked all their life, haven't been sick of anything, and have died from causes not related to addiction.  Again, it turns out, the probability? <br><br>  You continue to smoke, because there is a <i>non-zero probability</i> that the consequences will not affect you.  And there is a <i>significant likelihood</i> that you have time to quit. <br><br>  And you will become rich sometime?  Not flat-car-vacation, but really?  What do you think? <br><br>  <i>The probability is</i> .  Russian and fairy tales about Emelya say that always, at any moment in time, some kind of miracle can happen that will take you upstairs. <br><br>  Or not, you decide, there is nothing to hope for, it‚Äôs necessary to work hard!  Not necessarily like a damn, but something needs to be done!  And on the main work, and new directions to search and try!  To <i>increase the likelihood</i> .  You don‚Äôt know a clear-cut algorithm for achieving success? <br><br>  Will you ever be happy?  Or are you already happy?  Or were you happy? <br><br>  We have nothing to argue about and justify with you.  With happiness, everything is very simple.  At any time you understand three things. <br><br>  First: you were happy before, although you did not understand it. <br>  Second: you are not happy now. <br>  Third: you will <i>probably</i> be happy in the future. <br><br>  Again, the probability.  Wherever you spit, everywhere she is.  Any event, one way or another, is subject to assessment of the probability of its occurrence. <br><br>  You do not prepare for bad things, you do not reduce risks, because you hope that <i>probability does not work</i> , and muck will not happen.  How did Confucius speak there?  Even if you need a sword once in a lifetime, you need to carry it. <br><br>  You don‚Äôt really work on the good, because you understand - the probability of its occurrence is not that great.  What then try hard? <br><br>  <i>Your whole life is riddled with probability</i> .  You do not think about it consciously, but in the subcortex, the probability estimate is very solid. <br><br>  And now think that <i>it is not subject to an assessment of probability</i> .  What in your life will happen <i>necessarily</i> , that is, with one hundred percent probability? <br><br>  What is there to think something ... Death will happen.  Required. <br><br>  Feel the difference.  There is death, there is everything else.  Death will happen.  Everything else is not a fact. <br><br>  There is nothing in this world but death that is bound to happen. <br><br>  Aliens can fly.  Roads can be made so that it is not necessary to repair.  AvtoVAZ will start producing decent cars.  In Chelyabinsk, stink will stop.  The officials will cease to strive.  Indian films will become more popular than Hollywood.  The money will disappear.  Atomic warfare will happen.  Grass out of the snow will grow.  Internet will be disconnected all over the world. <br><br>  Everything <i>is likely</i> to happen.  And death will happen for sure.  The probability is 100%. <br><br>  Think on this for now.  I already thought, invented and changed something.  For example, approaches to personal effectiveness. <br><br>  Here is your schedule.  No one but you will understand him, but that is not important.  At that moment, when the usual methods raised my personal effectiveness 4 times, it seemed that the limit was reached. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/z-/-8/ly/z--8ly_pybi436f0a6upin4tppa.jpeg"><br><br>  But ‚ÄúKelvin Point‚Äù appeared, and personal efficiency grew 1.5 times more.  The Kelvin point spawned Flowcon, which almost doubled the bar. <br><br>  Can you imagine that?  I herachu 10 times more effective than you.  And I know for sure that this is not the limit.  I'm not even close to the limit. <br><br>  But I will teach you everything.  We have nothing to share with you.  About death do not forget to think. <br><br><h4>  What to do at work? </h4><br>  When you come to work, every time you ask yourself a simple question - what am I pinned here?  Especially in the morning, when the brain is still more or less fresh and not clouded by current tasks, relationships with colleagues and other insanely important heresies. <br><br>  You sit, you drink your morning coffee, you look at your colleagues and you don‚Äôt understand - what‚Äôs wrong?  Why should I go here?  Why do I need this? <br><br>  It happens that you have a long, interesting task that you have been doing for several days.  Yesterday I spent the whole day without noticing how it was time to go home.  Today I woke up before the alarm clock, jumped off and immediately walked around the house, thinking about this task.  On such days, strange questions never come to mind. <br><br>  And it happens the other way around.  At work - either a boring routine, from which he has already turned back, or tasks set by someone - that is, not yours, you are not in them, you are just a performer.  On such days, it happens that you wonder about the purpose of your arrival at work all day. <br><br>  Do you think I'll tell you now that you need to stop doing the routine and look only for interesting tasks?  Nifiga <br><br>  What exactly do at work - without any difference.  The main thing - <i>to do</i> . <br><br>  Understand one simple thing.  You came to work at 8-00, and leave at 17-00.  It's 9 o'clock.  Half your day.  And you especially have no options.  You should come at 8-00 and leave at 17-00.  Catch already?  Come on, come on. <br><br>  You cannot control the size of this length of time, but its <i>content</i> , or quality, is completely in your hands.  And I don‚Äôt need to tell me that you are being given foolish tasks that you shouldn‚Äôt do.  It would be better to do!  Sit and do!  Try your best  Make this dumbest, most senseless task the best!  Make it so that the boss ran away from you, not wanting to hear anymore how cool you solved this problem! <br><br>  Manage the <i>quality of</i> your work day.  You know why you have to do it yourself.  Because to all people of this planet, by and large, you, your work, and the quality of your life are completely indifferent. <br><br>  And you - no.  It must be no.  And, I know you - you really do not care. <br><br>  <i>Cuddle - work</i> .  Everything. <br><br>  It is like a vacation.  After all, when you come to the sea, do not sleep all day in the room?  I know not.  You try to use the time to the maximum, because you paid for it. <br><br>  Consider that you pay money for being at work.  You, such a mediocre, lazy and ugly valenok admitted to a decent company.  There are a lot of smart people sitting there who are ready to share their experience with you, help you grow, throw up interesting tasks and sometimes even trust you a little responsibility.  Damn, you still pay for it! <br><br>  So what are you chewing snot?  No need to deliver on the topic of bad bosses, vile directors and nouveau riche-owners.  <i>You pinned yourself</i> .  And most importantly - you pinned <i>for yourself</i> .  So take it all. <br><br>  Why do you consider only the salary as an exhaust from work?  Yes, the salary, especially at first - generally spit and grind, compared with the experience and knowledge that you can get!  And you sit and chew snot. <br><br>  You take away only the salary, because they lend it to you.  Or transferred to the card.  And experience, knowledge, skills, reputation - all those fuckingly useful values ‚Äã‚Äãthat lie under your feet - you bypass.  Thinking that the salary, which you have prozhresh for a month and procure, is much more valuable.  The month will end, nothing will be left.  The result of your life in a month is a bunch of shit, forgive me. <br><br>  Come on, get your head out of your ass already.  <i>Take a maximum of work</i> .  This is a great opportunity, believe me - I live more years. <br><br><h4>  XOR in life </h4><br>  I do not know if you are aware or not, but there is such a logical operation as ‚Äúexclusive or‚Äù, better known as XOR.  And you constantly apply it in life, from which you lose infinitely many. <br><br>  XOR is when you have to choose only one.  Although I write wrong - you should not do anything.  But you still choose only one.  What are you doing with the rest? <br><br>  <i>You oppose</i> .  Yes, by the way, most people do this, imperceptibly.  Especially in the comments on the Internet. <br><br>  Here are some examples of judgments using XOR. <br><br>  It is better to listen not hard, but punk. <br>  To lose weight, you need to do fitness, and not invent their own ways. <br>  It is necessary to program javascript, not 1C. <br>  It is necessary not to write stories, but to solve problems. <br>  We have to go to the factory to work, and not to try to engage in business. <br>  You better sit quietly, and do not hang out. <br><br>  Well, etc., to infinity.  The formula is simple: <br><br><ol><li>  There is a certain statement, a hypothesis, experience, a technique, practice, the decision, etc .; </li><li>  Someone reads it, hears it, or it sees and compares it with its own ideas; </li><li>  And performs the <i>opposition of</i> his and others. </li></ol><br>  This is the XOR.  One opinion is opposed to another, and from two it is necessary to choose one of them.  One experience is contrary to the other, so it pulls you to call one of them a profanation. <br><br>  There are many reasons for applying XOR, but one of the root causes is the protection of one‚Äôs own importance.  It may seem that a person, for example, defends his experience when he waters shit on someone else.  But, in most cases, a person does not have any real experience, and he <i>pours slop just like that</i> . <br><br>  Let them do as they wish, so they do.  And you stop using XOR.  Replace it with OR - logical OR.  Although it is called a disjunction, which is translated from Latin as ‚Äúdissociation‚Äù, but in fact it is more like a sum. <br><br>  Simply put, OR is "that, and the other, and the third, and all at once."  Suits - in the sense of the result.  The result is important, not srach on the Internet.  To you at least. <br><br>  No need to oppose hard and punk.  Listen to the one and the other.  Everywhere there are cool songs, everywhere there is crap. <br><br>  Millions of ways are suitable for losing weight.  Try a few, and decide what gives you personally the maximum result. <br><br>  Program on what the soul and the task are asking.  On js zadolbatsya accounting system to write.  On 1C - the web application.  To each his own.  But we need both, because the tasks are different. <br><br>  You can solve problems and write stories.  At the same time solve more problems than those who do not write stories.  And write better than the one who only writes.  Believe me. <br><br>  The plant is great.  There definitely need to work, at least once in a lifetime, in order to understand this very life.  And business needs to work out, then your understanding of life will drastically improve.  What for to oppose something? <br><br>  And why, in fact, no need to stick out?  And why sit quietly why is it bad?  Maybe sit quietly in the morning, and in the evening - to stick out?  Or vice versa?  Or sit quietly so that it seemed that you leaned out? <br><br>  XOR is the input filter that you put for some reason.  Something new comes - it doesn't matter what it is - and you act on one of two scenarios.  Or you sweep aside the new, because yours won the XOR.  Or you throw out yours, because the new one has turned out to be more XOR. <br><br>  And you can leave both the old and the new.  There will be two.  All have one, and you have two.  Then three, four, five hundred, a million, and so on. <br><br><h4>  A special case </h4><br>  Here you decided, let's say, to quit smoking.  Or go for a run every day.  Or lose a dozen kilograms.  Or eat an apple every day, such as  You keep the day, another, maybe even the third, and then ... What then? <br><br>  Then you have a special case.  It doesn‚Äôt matter what exactly happened - bad or good - but you immediately recognize this case as Special, and leave the chosen path of change.  Any little thing is able to put you out of yourself, knock out a rut, make you stop, so what?  Somehow this special case is noted.  And you mark it in such a way that contradicts your change strategy. <br><br>  If you quit smoking, you will mark a special case with a cigarette. <br>  If you wanted to lose weight, then buy yourself a cake or a hefty hamburger, and even a liter of cola. <br>  If you wanted to work a lot and qualitatively, then you will spend half a day on YouTube. <br>  If you wanted to go jogging, then as a reward or consolation you choose not to go jogging. <br><br>  What is interesting is that if you simply live, do not change anything and do not strive for anything, there will be very few special cases and you will not celebrate them.  But as soon as you conceived something, led yourself out of the comfort zone, began to form the necessary habit, immediately Special cases begin to crumble like from a horn of plenty. <br><br>  You will begin to interpret even the most ordinary situations, events and states as Special.  Someone on the street looked askance at you - everything, life is shit.  The client did not respond to the letter - well, he does not want to work with me.  He wanted to lose a kilogram, but instead gained 100 grams - well, fuck her, this diet. <br><br>  Here I am writing this text, and in my head there is a special case - today the child broke a thermometer, and I laundered the floors with potassium permanganate.  It would seem that the case is really special?  I have never broken a thermometer, and have not seen how this happens.  It's time to drop all your plans and read endless articles on the Internet about how harmful mercury is and what needs to be done in order not to die. <br><br>  But no, figushki.  I sit and write this text because I was going to write it.  Yes, the case with a thermometer corrected my plans - I had to leave work earlier, spend less time on programming and almost never do music.  But this shitty text I'll write. <br><br>  Because there is nothing special in this, as in most other cases is not.  Special - this is the assessment that you give yourself.  Do you understand?  This is not a deterministic property of the case, independent of you, like, I do not know ... The color of milk. <br><br>  You yourself paint a situation, event or condition in some color.  Sad, frightening, cheerful, encouraging, long-awaited, etc.  And you strengthen the assessment, calling the event Special. <br><br>  Just stop doing it.  Make a list of really special cases for yourself, and be guided by it.  Then they will become not Special, but Planned.  New year, birthdays, holidays, saturday, etc.  - how do you decide.  A kind of strategy element. <br><br>  In all other cases, just react as much as required.  Flat tire?  Pump up and go to the tire.  When repaired - act further according to plan, taking into account the loss of time.  Is the child sick?  Stay at home, do everything you need and follow the plan.  Or change the plan - create a new one, and follow it. <br><br>  The main thing - do not declare a special case, even in thought.  Then he will not knock you out of a rut. <br><br>  The special one is the excuse you seek for yourself.  You want to go back to the comfort zone, where you just lie on the couch, or you go on the Internet, or play Dark Messiah of Might and Magic.  But you do not want this from life? </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/441732/">https://habr.com/ru/post/441732/</a></p>
