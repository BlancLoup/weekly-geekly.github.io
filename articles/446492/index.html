Prepare for entrance tests </h4><br><p>  The courses of the center will not suit absolutely beginners: we need basic knowledge of mathematics and programming even for the very first courses.  Look at the program for admission to the center and try to solve the variants of tests and exams of past years in order to prepare and feel more confident. </p><br><h4 id="4-zapolnite-anketuhttpscompscicenterruapplication-na-postuplenie-do-13-aprelya-i-reshite-zadaniya-onlayn-testa">  4. <a href="https://compscicenter.ru/application/">Fill out the application form</a> before April 13 and solve the tasks of the online test </h4><br><p>  Details about the test in the letter after filling out the form on the site. </p><br><h4 id="5-uchastvuyte-v-ekzamene">  5.

Students choose a direction or specialization in the learning process, but now it is worth having an idea about what you want to do and what to learn. </p><br><p>  <strong>Does the training program include practice?</strong>  <strong>How does this happen?</strong> <br>  <a href="https://compscicenter.ru/pages/projects/">Practicing</a> for CS center students is working on a real task under the guidance of an experienced and enthusiastic employee of Yandex, JetBrains or another IT company. </p><br><p>  <strong>I want to do science - where should I go?</strong> <br>  Apply for full-time study in St. Petersburg and choose the direction of Computer Science.  Students in this field are working on <a href="https://compscicenter.ru/pages/projects/">a research project</a> - this is a great opportunity to start a scientific career. </p><br><p>  <strong>I live in St. Petersburg or Novosibirsk, can I come in absentia?</strong> <br>  Yes it is possible.  If you think that correspondence education is the most suitable for you now, go there. </p><br><p>  <strong>How to understand which form of training suits me best?</strong>  <strong>How are the requirements for admission?</strong> <br>  We recommend to apply for full-time study if it is in your city - you will get access to a greater number of courses, to face-to-face activities and personal interaction with teachers, curators and other students.  The stages of recruitment, entrance tests and <a href="https://compscicenter.ru/enrollment/program/">training requirements are the</a> same for full-time and part-time. </p><br><h3 id="postuplenie">  Receipt </h3><br><p>  <strong>Are there any restrictions on education or age?</strong> <br>  Not.  The main thing is interest in studying, motivation, the opportunity to study at least 15 hours a week and knowledge that will help start. </p><br><p>  <strong>All applicants go through all three stages: online test, exam, interview?</strong> <br>  Not.  At the end of each stage, we are forced to refuse any number of those who want to do. </p><br><p>  <strong>Is it possible to apply for full-time and part-time studies simultaneously?</strong> <br>  No, you only need to select one branch in the questionnaire. </p><br><p>  <strong>How to prepare for the exam?</strong> <br>  Look at <a href="https://yadi.sk/d/PMdV1XwxUwNqGQ">past options</a> and <a href="https://compscicenter.ru/enrollment/program/">admission program</a> .  If the exam is written, then bring a pen, and if online - make yourself comfortable in a place where there is stable access to the Internet. </p><br><p>  <strong>How to prepare for an interview?</strong> <br>  See the program for admission, relax before the interview, think in advance why you should study at the CS Center and why you need enough motivation to graduate.  Read the information on our site, make a list of questions to the interviewees, if something remains unclear. </p><br><p>  <strong>What to do if you could not do?</strong> <br>  Try again a year later, come to open lectures and <a href="https://compsciclub.ru/">CS club</a> courses in St. Petersburg, take online courses. </p><br><p>  <strong>Do you take into account certificates for Stepik?</strong> <br>  Not.

At the same time there are certain rules that we ask you to follow.  We tell about them to first-year students at the first meeting. </p><br><p>  <strong>How long are the classes?</strong>  <strong>How many classes to attend per week?</strong> <br>  Classes are held in the evening, usually two in a row.  The duration of one and a half hours.  Students choose their own courses for the semester, so you can choose the optimal schedule.  Usually you need to come in person 2-3 times a week.  The rest of the time is spent on homework. </p><br><p>  <strong>Is it possible to combine training in the CS center with work?</strong> <br>  Cases when it succeeds, there is.  But we recommend that you focus on your studies and get the most out of it before you go head to head into work. </p><br><p>  <strong>Will there be classes during student sessions?</strong> <br>  We try to plan semesters so that at the end of December, January, the end of May and in June there will be no classes.  It is possible that at this time there will be presentations of the practice or retake, but the main burden falls on the period before the session at the university. </p><br><p>  <strong>What you need to bring to class?</strong> <br>  Notebooks and pens are almost always needed.  In some classes, a laptop is useful - teachers warn about this in advance. </p><br><p>  <strong>How much does it cost to study at CS center?</strong> <br>  Full-time tuition is free.  In absentia - 40 000 rubles.  per semester. </p><br><p>  <strong>Can I recount the university courses of the same name?</strong> <br>  Not.
