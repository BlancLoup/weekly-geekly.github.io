  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Ticket to LANIT. Be in the game</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Who did you dream to be in childhood?  Is it a programmer, developer, analyst or tester?  Hardly.  And not because these professions at that time were not yet in the top.  It‚Äôs just hard for a child to imagine what kind of professions they are, because they don‚Äôt face them in everyday life.  And for parents, even if they themselves are IT specialists to the bone, it is difficult to explain what is so important and interesting they do at work.  We decided to correct this situation and invite the children of our employees, partners and clients to our central office for the space-based guidance game for teenagers from 10 to 15 years old ‚ÄúTicket to LANIT‚Äù.  On the eve of Children's Day, we will tell you more about this project in our blog. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d21/703/aee/d21703aee1e4944b9a211d9a80305d80.jpg"></div><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  The key to start </h2><br>  On one of Saturdays, from 60 to 100 teenagers are going to the office early in the morning.  It is impossible to accept more for technical reasons - otherwise the event will be delayed until late at night. <br><br>  Children register, receive badges and backpacks with a cosmic breakfast in tubes, and are distributed among teams.  Each should be no more than 10-12 people, preferably one and the same age.  If this rule is not followed, then working at master classes will be very difficult.  Each team has its own captain - a volunteer from among the company's employees.  The captain is both a Pioneer leader, a nurse, and Mr. "I solve all questions."

They, by the way, are going almost more than children.  For parents there is a separate program: tours of the building, screening of documentary films from our partners of the Documentary Film Festival DOKer (we already wrote about our cooperation <a href="https://habr.com/ru/company/lanit/blog/444158/">here</a> ). <br><br>  Each team of teenagers receives a routing list - a schedule of those activities that they have to go through during the game. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/911/f1c/f4e/911f1cf4e79e3e8558568dfbedfb7fe1.jpg" width="500"></div><br>  These are five master classes from the divisions of our group, a tour of the building calling at the demo data center, an ATM repair area and many other interesting places where not all of the company's employees visited.  In order to take a break and have a rest from everything seen and heard, there is a relaxation area with interactive entertainment and a free buffet under the conditional name Cosmopit.  True, in the buffet there are quite earthly cookies, pies and tea.  But it‚Äôs impossible without them, the brains of the game participants should work six hours in a row - a whole school day. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/7ea/4f0/e8f/7ea4f0e8fc4819ede9d974c45644e640.jpg"></div>  <i>Earth food for space game and ...</i> <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/819/18f/f4a/81918ff4a839027142c24398b0881827.jpg"></div>  <i>... and as a souvenir food for real astronauts</i> <br><br><h2>  I would go to the programmers - let them teach me </h2><br>  What master classes do we offer to game participants?  Of course, space - because the main theme of our game "Who will I become in the future."  And what is the future without space?  Master class from the company " <a href="https://www.in-systems.ru/">INSISTEMS</a> " - a real hit.  A model of the Vostochny cosmodrome, in the construction of which the INSISTEMS team took part, the stages of assembling a real rocket and, finally, experiments with liquid fuel.  First, a live rose is thrown into liquid nitrogen, and then the master of the master class puts a hand in it.  Children just freeze in horror and delight: ‚ÄúNo, do not need a hand, please!‚Äù - ‚ÄúWow!  Nothing happened.  Why?".  Do you know what happened to the rose and why the hand was not damaged?  But our children now know. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/3a3/19c/08d/3a319c08dda4f8f34983c89b64263c34.jpg"></div>  <i>Lethal number (do not repeat!) - the master of the master class puts its hand in liquid nitrogen.</i>  <i>How will this experiment end?</i> <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/2dc/7a3/a6b/2dc7a3a6be4d6b0d25b740c8fe117cd5.jpg"></div>  <i>How does a real rocket work?</i>  <i>Learn and repeat the assembly steps</i> <br><br>  No less successful is the master class from the department of CAD "Digital Twin" - flying on an aircraft simulator.  Take off and try to land on a huge Boeing - this adventure does not happen every day!  The master of the master class with the participation of almost the entire male part of the department‚Äôs team on the eve of the whole evening set up a flight simulator.  Well, we ourselves have steered a little - in fact, swayed and dizzy.  So entertainment is not for the faint of heart.  And the guys coped perfectly: they "flew" in pairs - one lifted the plane into the air, the second was responsible for a soft landing. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b3b/33d/397/b3b33d397e664c38e07496b1f62b4b2a.jpg"></div>  <i>The course of accelerated pilot training "Takeoff-landing".</i>  <i>Not just entertainment - the first acquaintance with the work of computer-aided design systems.</i> <br><br>  At the master class from LANIT Digital ‚ÄúWe're shooting video content‚Äù, real miracles were happening - in 30 minutes they managed to create a real film crew from each team and make a cool video.  That's what it means - professionals in creating video content.  If you also need watchable video content, do not hesitate to contact us. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wyf59Y7ahBs" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  At the master class of the company <a href="http://treolan.ru/">Treolan</a> "Using alternative interfaces to interact with the computer," his host came in a superhero T-shirt to create the right mood.  But the participants of the game felt like real superheroes - shooting meteorites with one glance and replaying Alice herself into the cities - this requires superpowers.  And the guys showed them. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/862/4b0/acb/8624b0acb2f51682595518902d280af5.jpg"></div>  <i>In LANIT, real superheroes are working that can, on their day off, show the younger generation new ways of interacting with interfaces.</i> <br><br>  The master class of the Department of Corporate Systems LANIT "Find a mistake on the remote control spacecraft" most of all liked those who are already trying themselves in programming and testing.  Some teenagers were so advanced that they could be recruited even tomorrow ‚Äî they instantly hacked into the site of the leading master class. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/17d/5b1/4aa/17d5b14aa38694643646f9ccc667dcf1.jpg"></div>  <i>The master of the master class is pleased: ‚ÄúA good change of testers is growing up!‚Äù</i> <br><br>  ‚ÄúIs the planet on which we landed suitable for life?‚Äù - a meteorological master class from <a href="https://itlanit.ru/">LANIT-Integration</a> began with this question.  Why did we choose such a topic?  Because one of the teams of LANIT-Integration was engaged in the re-equipment of meteorological observation stations of Roshydromet.  So we have real experts in the field of weather observation.  It turns out that boring columns of weather data can tell so much interesting about the world around.  Well, to make samples of water for fitness to drink they wanted absolutely everything.  It is a pity that there were only two weather probes.  Yes, and water tanks too.  You can write a separate story about how we searched for these huge vases on all the back streets of the LANIT building. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ff7/5bf/c40/ff75bfc402508b897c9977479b937ab2.jpg"></div>  <i>LANIT has it all - even real meteorological equipment.</i>  <i>Do you know how to predict the weather?</i> <br><br>  Training center " <a href="https://academy.ru/">Network Academy LANIT</a> " presented not only a master class on encryption "Information security.  Data protection logbook ", but also an interactive game" <a href="https://www.lanit.ru/press/archive/17390/%3Fsphrase_id%3D29556">Battle of Golems</a> "for the relax zone.  This is one of the best board games about IT, it allows you to develop algorithmic thinking.  Playing it is not only interesting, but also very useful.  But here it is time to tell what kind of relax-zone. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/8eb/db2/ae3/8ebdb2ae3b8ab0f523d1767f843c5c11.png"></div><br><h2>  How to make vacation interactive </h2><br>  What besides gadgets can take children during the rest?  Our partners and subsidiaries provided a lot of useful and high-tech entertainment. <br>  Robust football from LANIT-Integration partners, Exam Tekhnolab company, made a worthy competition to the game from ‚ÄúNetwork Academy‚Äù in the relax zone.  To drive robots around the field with a ball and everyone, both children and adults, especially dads, wanted to root for their player actively. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/5ec/cde/41c/5eccde41c38f7f4ee50d864b9c2778f2.jpg"></div>  <i>Robot-football: a decisive match for the Galaxy Cup</i> <br><br>  You could also try to control the drone or compose your own arrangement of your favorite melody at the DJ console.  This entertainment was provided by our subsidiary <a href="https://di-house.ru/">diHouse</a> , which also deals with the distribution of digital DJ consoles.  Virtual reality glasses are familiar to many today, but they also caused a storm of emotions among the participants in the game.  All thanks to the author's content <a href="https://fibrum.com/">Fibrum</a> , a startup in which he invested LANIT.  This company was one of the first in the Russian market to release its own virtual reality glasses, and now it has focused on creating interesting content for working with them.  By the way, all these things can be bought, if not for family leisure, then, for example, for school recreation areas or for summer teenage camps.  The benefits are much greater than the twenty-four-hour sitting in social networks. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f19/ba4/b51/f19ba4b51b08ea874f6f7afcf3918c35.jpg"></div>  <i>‚ÄúEverybody is dancing!‚Äù - the future star of club parties at the DJ console.</i> <br><br>  By the way, the relax-zone was not the only pleasant surprise for our guests.  At all the master classes, the guys received prizes for completing assignments and just pleasant souvenirs from various departments of the company.  This is where the backpacks with the space breakfast came in handy - at the end of the event it was full of various useful trifles, such as pop-sockets, magnets, notebooks and stickers. <br><br><h2>  LANIT - wait for us! </h2><br>  What is the effect we got from the game "Ticket to LANIT"?  First, they showed how interesting it is to work in our company.  And they even gave out to all the participants of the game the certificates ‚ÄúTicket to LANIT‚Äù - a document that allows you to apply for any internship vacancies of LANIT when you reach 18 years of age.  We are sure that some of the guys will come to us really soon.  By the way, in the feedback questionnaires that all participants filled out in the final of the game, there was also such a significant statement for us ‚ÄúWait for me to LANIT in 10-15 years‚Äù. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/531/afc/ed4/531afced4c4aa475524f863bb650113c.jpg" width="500"></div><br>  Secondly, we have shown how many interesting professions, subject areas and opportunities exist for those who are 10-15 years old today.  And they themselves saw those who really come to replace us.  For our young employees, and among the game volunteers, there were most of them, it was very useful and in many ways unexpected. <br><br>  And, finally, we got acquainted with many of the company's employees.  After all, with so many people who work with us, it is sometimes impossible to know even those whom you see every day.  On ‚ÄúTicket to LANIT‚Äù we once again saw what excellent people we work with.  By the way, one of our adult guests asked if he could send a resume, he liked our company so much. <br><br>  We plan to hold the next ‚ÄúTicket to LANIT‚Äù in the fall for teenagers from our sponsored orphanages and boarding schools.  Although we already have applications from our employees, some of them want to bring their children for the second and even third time). <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VHrFXBtQOQI" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/1dc/9fb/c0a/1dc9fbc0ac8552ea67c7fea86a9297ff.jpg"></div></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/453844/">https://habr.com/ru/post/453844/</a></p>
