After all, buckwheat with macaroni will soon be eaten, but you can earn new grubs by investing time in self-education.  You understand that in difficult times it is beneficial to be universal, unpretentious and not ill.  We may talk about the last two qualities separately, but now let's discuss the range of the most interesting literature on information security and programming, published in 2014. <br><br><h1>  Security </h1><br><h4>  <b>Hacker Tactics: A Practical Guide to Penetration Testing (The Hacker Playbook: A Practical Guide To Penetration Testing)</b> </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/091/3f4/f88/0913f4f88dba40ce887cfcbdf3c5b7f9.jpg"><br><br>  The book is written in the style of planning a football game.  Here, the problems and difficulties that security experts face while testing protection systems are described in detail and step by step.  In particular, attacks on various types of networks, bypassing antiviruses and hacking security systems are considered.  The author of the book is Peter Kim, IT security specialist with many years of experience, the CEO of Secure Planet. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  <b>The Art of Memory Analysis: Detecting Malware and Threats in Windows, Linux, and Mac (Detection of Malware and Threats in Windows, Linux and Mac)</b> </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/227/0ec/f84/2270ecf84fdd42fba4950bca8e80f2ac.jpg">

      As it is not difficult to guess, the book is devoted to the analysis of RAM in order to prevent and investigate cybercrime.  The text is based on the program of the 5-day master class, which is taught by the authors.  And this is one of the few books dedicated to this subject.  Here are the following topics: <br><ul><li>  How analysis of volatile memory contributes to cybercrime investigation </li><li>  Procedure for detecting hidden malware and integrated threats </li><li>  Using opensource-tools for detection and analysis </li><li>  How to protect computer memory from potential threats </li></ul><br><h4>  <b>Instructions for responding to cyber threats (Blue Team Handbook: Incident Responder: A condensed field guide)</b> </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/869/dc3/883/869dc3883ad0406ab69904ee11642a35.jpg"><br><br>  The book is a collection of instructions and recommendations for responding to information security-related incidents.  It describes common attack methods, software tools, network analysis methodology, examples of using tcpdump and Snort IDS, as well as many other issues.  Basically, the content of the book reflects the experience of authors with teaching and working experience in the field of network security. <br><br><h4>  <b>Cybersecurity Practices Guide for Executives (Cybersecurity for Executives: A Practical Guide)</b> </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ae2/529/ae7/ae2529ae79034211a9b1cbb808cb249a.jpg"><br><br>  This book will help business owners and managers to make well-informed decisions to ensure the information security of their business.  Here is available and briefly described how to recognize, understand, evaluate and mitigate the risks associated with information security.  The book also touches upon such topics as planning measures for restoring and developing a business in the event of an attack; recommendations are given to integrate security measures into the company's development strategy and to change the management system of the company and personnel.  Also describes the most effective ways to ensure the safety of important information available to management, in the office and at home. <br><br><h4>  <b>Social Engineering: Human Factors and Security (Unmasking the Social Engineer: The Human Element of Security)</b> </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f5b/371/78f/f5b37178fba14905929c1a1fd8a5fad2.jpg"><br><br>  This edition is devoted to the scientific approach to non-verbal communication in social engineering, which helps to recognize fraudsters and crooks who are trying to get into trust and build closer relations in order to circumvent the existing security systems.  It describes how to build such attacks and how to recognize them.  Visual analogies for the communication of non-verbal communication with social engineering and fraud have been made.  Various "dirty" tricks used by fraudsters are described, recommendations are given that you should pay attention to first. <br><br><h4>  <b>Bulletproof SSL and TLS: Deploying SSL / TLS and PKI on servers and in web applications (Bulletproof SSL and TLS: Understanding and Deploying SSL / TLS and Secure Servers and Web Applications)</b> </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/1c9/849/0ce/1c98490ce1e24d5aad5dbed3fad58e9b.jpg"><br><br>  It details how to encrypt SSL and TLS, used on servers and in various web projects.  In fact, this is a comprehensive guide to ensure that your systems are protected from information interception and attacks under the guise of an authorized user.

The book tells about the features of reverse engineering in x86, x64 and ARM architectures.  The technologies for protecting virtual machines, as well as the use of rootkits and step-by-step analysis of the Windows kernel drivers are considered.  The last question, by the way, is rarely covered in the literature.  The book is valuable for its systematic presentation of the material, with a large number of practical examples and independent tasks.  The bonus chapter also discusses tools for reversing. <br><br><h4>  <b>Java Battleship: Building Secure Web Applications (Iron-Clad Java: Building Secure Web Applications)</b> </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e2d/8d3/0e2/e2d8d30e266b4c40a1918bc4ec23f9d6.jpg"><br><br>  The book addresses such issues as: <br><ul><li>  secure authentication and session management </li><li>  creating a system of tight access control in multi-user web applications, </li><li>  counteraction to cross-site scripting, cross-site request forgery and clickjacking </li><li>  protection of important data during storage and shipment, </li><li>  prevention of attacks using code injection, including SQL, </li><li>  securing file I / O operations and loading </li><li>  logging, error handling, intrusion detection methods </li></ul><br><h4>  <b>Creating a security infrastructure for a cloud project (Building the Infrastructure for Cloud Security: A Solutions View (Expert‚Äôs Voice in Internet Security))</b> </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c0d/2c5/a09/c0d2c5a095084854bec20dc38f999e0a.jpg"><br><br>  The cloud services boom brought with it numerous problems with ensuring their security.
