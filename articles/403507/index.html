The office announced the Target Neuroplasticity Training (TNT) program in March 2016 and is now starting work on finding the safest and most effective ways to activate a natural process called synaptic plasticity. <br><br>  Plasticity is the ability of the brain to strengthen or weaken neural connections in order to adapt to changes in the environment.  TNT Program Manager Dr. Doug Werber associates synaptic plasticity with learning.

      The TNT study focuses on a specific type of learning - cognitive skills.  People use cognitive skills to focus attention, process information, divide attention into several tasks at the same time, identify and understand patterns, memorize instructions, organize information, and more.  The US Department of Defense expects that TNT will reduce the cost and shorten the duration of training for foreign language specialists, intelligence analysts, cryptographers and others. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  The TNT research team is trying to determine the physiological mechanisms that could enable them to improve natural learning by electrostimulating peripheral nerves - those that connect neurons in the brain and spinal cord with organs, skin and muscles - so that the brain perceives new knowledge more quickly during key learning points. . <br><br>  Scientists still do not fully understand what mechanisms underlie this improvement, but they believe that neurostimulation promotes the release of <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259D%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B9%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B0%25D1%2582%25D0%25BE%25D1%2580">neurotransmitters</a> : <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2590%25D1%2586%25D0%25B5%25D1%2582%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BB%25D1%2585%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BD">acetylcholine</a> , which performs neuromuscular transmission, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norepinephrine">norepinephrine</a> ‚Äî the ‚Äúcheerfulness mediator‚Äù ‚Äîand others that play an important role in modulating cognitive processes, related to learning. <br><br>  The main goal of TNT is to activate various mechanisms to understand the links between neurostimulation, neurotransmitter release and the resulting changes in plasticity. <br><br>  To activate peripheral nerves, researchers will compare non-invasive electrostimulation through the skin with an invasive ‚Äî using an implanted device ‚Äî and then draw conclusions that are more effective. <br><br>  Werber plans to go even further and create a device that activates plasticity, using electricity to stimulate peripheral nerves through the skin.  He noted that already on the market there are devices designed to stimulate the brain and peripheral nerves.  ‚ÄúYou can go online right now and buy a device for $ 50, which manufacturers claim stimulates your brain and causes it to do all sorts of things,‚Äù said Weber.  Such companies make technology available without any guarantee that it is safe or even effective. <br><br>  In the first part of TNT research, scientists will work on defining the mechanisms that underlie how nerve stimulation affects brain plasticity.  They are also trying to detect physiological indicators that show that stimulation is working, and to identify and minimize the side effects of nerve stimulation, if any. <br><br>  In the second half of the program, researchers will use neurostimulation technology in various types of training exercises to measure improvements in speed and degree of learning.  At the same time, some research teams will work with military intelligence analysts and foreign language experts to understand how the learning process is going now.  The goal of cooperation is to turn the middle squad into unsurpassed linguists much faster than is possible today.  The TNT platform can be customized to meet their needs. <br><br>  In partnership with the University of Arizona, the team will work with staff at the Air Force Research Laboratory to study how the brain reacts during reconnaissance, shooting, and observation. <br><br>  DARPA approaches the study of synaptic plasticity from several perspectives to determine if there are safe and effective ways to improve learning and speed up the acquisition of skills related to US national security missions.  The TNT program will help compensate for the cuts in staff for each military service <br><br>  TNT is part of the more extensive DARPA <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BRAIN_Initiative">BRAIN</a> project supported by the White House.  This initiative was announced by the administration of Barack Obama in 2013.  It supports the development of innovative neurotechnologies that can create a dynamic picture of brain functions - how individual cells and complex neural circuits interact in time and space.  BRAIN also explores brain disorders such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson‚Äôs diseases, depression and head injuries. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/403507/">https://habr.com/ru/post/403507/</a></p>
