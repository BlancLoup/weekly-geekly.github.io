And the desire of the media is clear to learn new information before, to publish first.  Unfortunately, the investigation into the appearance of a hole in the Soyuz MS-09 ship on August 30 caused a stream of publications that not only confused the mysterious accident, but also in places literally made it cling to the head. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ol/gz/r_/olgzr_ixl51w-fq_awuez6j2t7k.jpeg"></div>  <i>Briefly about the coverage of the accident</i> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  Brief background </h2><br>  On the night of August 30, an air leak from the ISS was detected.  There was no danger, the astronauts and astronauts did not even wake up in alarm.  In the morning, the leak was installed and sealed with a plaster soaked in a special epoxy.  Leak eliminated.  But when it was discovered that the hole looked like a drilled hole, the original version of the micrometeorite hit was discarded.  And wrap it all up ... <br><br><h2>  A riot of news </h2><br>  Unfortunately, after more than two years after the accident Progress MS-04, the coverage of which I <a href="https://habr.com/post/399849/">criticized</a> , the situation has not improved.  The shaft of anonymous "sources in the industry" again fell upon us.

      <br>
      Already on Monday, a certain ‚Äúinterlocutor of the agency,‚Äù RIA Novosti <a href="https://ria.ru/space/20180903/1527705864.html">claimed</a> that, allegedly, the cause of the accident was negligence, and ‚Äúthe person responsible for it was already installed.‚Äù  A few days later, however, they <a href="https://www.newsru.com/russia/06sep2018/mks.html">wrote</a> that they had suspected a recently retired employee, and he was acquitted.  So the ‚Äúsource‚Äù, as usual, provided inaccurate information. <br><br>  In the same article there was a version that the hole was sealed with some kind of glue, which was then ‚Äúsqueezed out‚Äù.  There were no traces of glue on the published photographs (there are also questions for them, about this in the next chapter). <br><br>  Tuesday confidently broke through the new bottom and brought the situation to a new level of absurdity - news agencies <a href="https://www.gazeta.ru/science/news/2018/09/04/n_11990893.shtml">delivered</a> headlines like "A mentally unstable cosmonaut could drill a hole in the Soyuz spacecraft on the ISS."  RIA Novosti <a href="https://ria.ru/science/20180904/1527795798.html">asked the</a> former cosmonaut Maxim Suraev, and it seems that he took the answer out of context to the question ‚ÄúCould cosmonauts have already drilled a hole in space?‚Äù.  In any case, they did not publish the original question of the journalist, and Suraev‚Äôs sensible appeal to not accuse anyone until the end of the investigation was placed after the most succinct replicas.  Then it began to diverge in waves, more and more yellowing in the process.  And the <a href="https://360tv.ru/news/tekst/durachkov-net/">comments of</a> other astronauts that this is nonsense, were lost in the Internet scribble. <br><br>  Wednesday also "pleased" us with new blunders.  <a href="https://ria.ru/science/20180905/1527834825.html">According to</a> another source (again, by the way, RIA Novosti), the turner performs work in the industry inside the Union, and <i>‚ÄúTurn the turner inside and leave for everyone - this cannot be in principle‚Äù</i> .  We have the answer - the <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A2%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B0%25D1%2580%25D1%258C">turner</a> launched into the ship is not one, but with the right lathe. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/t3/2s/hr/t32shrkw_joutltuifwcjvrrtio.jpeg"><br>  <i>Turner works for the machine, photo Wikimedia Commons</i> <br><br>  Well, yesterday, on Thursday, the news agencies pleased us with controversial reports again of anonymous "sources" that, allegedly, "Soyuz" was <a href="https://tass.ru/kosmos/5528667">drilled</a> when it was already fully assembled, and at the same time, the commission <a href="https://ria.ru/science/20180906/1527915418.html">allegedly rejected the</a> version that it was done in the general assembly shop.  And so that no trash is left unattended, they are now <a href="https://ria.ru/science/20180906/1527919966.html">broadcasting the</a> idea of ‚Äã‚Äãintentional damage to the hull. <br><br>  As a result, the media before the end of Roskosmos, that on Wednesday he made a <a href="https://www.roscosmos.ru/25477/">request to</a> stop disseminating unverified information, but, alas, judging by the Thursday news, he was ignored. <br><br><blockquote>  <i>Roscosmos asks media representatives to refrain from publishing unverified information received from anonymous sources on the results of the work of the commission to investigate the abnormal situation that occurred onboard the Soyuz MS-09 manned spacecraft in the International Space Station.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>The commission‚Äôs work will be completed in mid-September, its findings will be submitted to the Roscosmos State Corporation, and then measures will be determined to prevent such situations.</i>  <i>Roscosmos stresses that references to so-called ‚Äúsources in the rocket and space industry‚Äù reporting various ‚Äúversions‚Äù of the investigation are a way to manipulate information and influence the work of representatives of the commission.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>Roscosmos recommends that Russian and foreign media refrain from publishing various versions with reference to anonymous sources until the commission‚Äôs work is completed.</i> <br></blockquote><h2>  Facts and Versions </h2><br>  Alas, we, people who have access only to public information, found themselves in a situation of lack of reliable facts.  Even the renowned photo of the hole is taken from a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3D4F5mK6sktrk">remote</a> NASA video and there is no one hundred percent guarantee that it really applies to this story. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/_l/t8/6s/_lt86sqsckoydcaiqw4wsjb539e.jpeg"><br>  <i>That photo</i> <br><br>  A <a href="http://kosmolenta.com/index.php/1286-2018-09-04-iss-air-leak">decoding of the</a> negotiations <a href="http://kosmolenta.com/index.php/1286-2018-09-04-iss-air-leak">appeared</a> on the site of Kosmolent, from which, alas, there is no unambiguous understanding of even the shape of the hole - whether it was drilled through or whether there was an almost drilled case with a broken hole of a different diameter. <br><br><blockquote>  <i>13:00 Oleg Artemyev: It seems that someone drilled a hole through this hole.</i>  <i>No, this is not a hole.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>Alexander Gerst: There is metal under the hole, so it is not through.</i>  <i>I put a centimeter in there somewhere, and found metal under the hole (Note: the wall thickness is even with a frame less than 1 cm; perhaps the stop fell into the sheet of anti-meteorite protection?)</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>Sergei Prokopiev: take photos with a ruler.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>13:10 We see tissue in the hole (with a hole?), And a hole with a cloth is not responsible for leaking.</i>  <i>They do not match by location.</i>  <i>The fabric is at an angle of 90 degrees, and a hole in it [is] for some reason.</i>  <i>Just Alex [Gerst] tore off this fabric, and the second hole on the surface ??</i>  <i>on metal, for some reason, a hole in the fabric.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>13:13 Sergey Prokopiev: This is a round hole.</i>  <i>The fact is that if you look inside this hole, it is not completely.</i>  <i>It was not done to the end.</i>  <i>And when you look inside, you see metal at the bottom of this hole.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>Oleg Artemyev: Depth is about 1.5-2 cm.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>MCC-M: There [behind the outer surface of the BO] there is an ETI and anti-meteoritic protection.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>Oleg Artemyev: Well, it turns out that this is micrometeorite protection.</i> </blockquote>  Information also appeared that in the assembly of the ship there were no tasks for drilling anything, there were no rivets either, but contact welding was used, and the pressure drop from the hole increased gradually.  In general, the main mystery of this incident is that reasonable versions do not correlate with the facts known to the general public. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/df/wr/q7/dfwrq7guqlvdwx9unhqxysid21w.jpeg"><br>  <i>Installation of meteorite protection on the household compartment</i> <br><br>  The version of the <b>micrometeorite</b> does not correlate with the photograph and impressions of the astronauts and has already been discarded. <br><br>  The hypothesis of a <b>hole drilled in space is</b> not combined with rumors that in the place where it was discovered, it is not that inconvenient, or it is impossible to drill, and the motive of such actions is completely absent. <br><br>  Versions of a <b>hole drilled and sealed during assembly are</b> contradicted by the absence of glue marks on the photo, and it‚Äôs necessary to explain why the sealed hole, having experienced vibrations and jerks of start, lost tightness only after three months, when even temperature drops should not be strong - the metal of the ship is under thermal insulation . <br>  The idea that the <b>hole was drilled partially and opened only now</b> is experiencing the same problems as the previous one. <br><br>  The hypothesis of <b>sabotage</b> does not have a motive - now that Dragon V2 and Starliner are almost ready, there is no point in spoiling the Soyuz.  Further, we need the ability of magical accuracy to the hole survived the test and opened up already in space.  And the danger of such a small hole did not represent any. <br><br>  Even a potentially interesting version of the <b>error when installing the on-board camera</b> , which gave hope that for the first time installing the camera on the ship, someone could be mistaken, breaks about the fact that it is far from the hole (photo with explanations from the forum of Cosmonautics News "). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ys/9y/ct/ys9yctth7knpy-ro3f16ol3gkp0.jpeg"><br>  <i>Camera location</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/eo/mq/nw/eomqnw-syujyeubb8ers45wtmmi.jpeg"><br>  <i>The hole was near the toilet, he is here</i> <br><br>  Just yesterday, I joked that with all the delusional version of a lunar <b>astronaut with a drill</b> at least explains why the hole appeared at night, and is consistent with the lack of a drill motive, but even now it contradicts rumors about problems of access to this place and the gradual increase in leakage. <br><br>  In general, the only thing left for us is to wait for the results of the work of the emergency commission, it does not remain for long.  And since there is no rational food for the brain, nothing better than collecting folklore that this accident has already generated, I cannot offer. <br><br><h2>  Memasiki </h2><br>  First of all, the incident made us remember the classics, the film ‚ÄúTaming of the fire‚Äù with the phrase ‚ÄúI was strictly forbidden to drill on the assembly!‚Äù <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://coub.com/embed/1dwh9p" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  The event has already spawned poems <br><br><blockquote>  <i>Flew space ship</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Through all the limits.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>And only in the side of his hole</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Whistled slightly.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>But unraveled on Earth,</i> <i><br></i>  <i>What was it.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>The drill slid in the ship,</i> <i><br></i>  <i>The drill bit slid.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>Slip traces drill</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Very noticeable.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Here, in an instant, the scale increased</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Holes budget.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>And on Rogozin forehead</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Shadows lay down.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Some problems brought</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Drill slip.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>Now the answer is to keep in the Kremlin,</i> <i><br></i>  <i>And this pitchfork.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>The drill slid in the ship,</i> <i><br></i>  <i>The drill bit slid ...</i> <br>  The author is an ATOM moderator from the forum <a href="http://allboxing.ru/">allboxing.ru</a> </blockquote><br><blockquote>  <i>Beautiful ISS at the end of April</i> <i><br></i>  <i>And in the summer, too, was nothing,</i> <i><br></i>  <i>And in August we were able to find it.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Traces of sabotage drills.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>As long as the astronauts slept peacefully,</i> <i><br></i>  <i>The grass near the house was seen in a dream</i> <i><br></i>  <i>They sent a US saboteur into space</i> <i><br></i>  <i>To them to drill a hole in the wall.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>Through the hole Russian secrets</i> <i><br></i>  <i>I would like to suck America.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>She has no life without secrets,</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Without their missiles, they do not collect.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>The enemy was treacherous in the CIA trained,</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Although the drilling part was weak,</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Our Russian locksmith made a hole b better</i> <i><br></i>  <i>A Pindos drills clear as: tyap-lyap.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>Besides, before him, strong and formidable,</i> <i><br></i>  <i>And alert, like a hundred Karatsup,</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Steel wall Dmitry rose Rogozin,</i> <i><br></i>  <i>On Pindos long had a tooth.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>Hole in the wall with secret glue</i> <i><br></i>  <i>And the ISS managed to extend life</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Ready to continue pindosskie venture</i> <i><br></i>  <i>In any hole Rogozin to find.</i> <br>  Posted by: Zyniker </blockquote><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/mb/h6/6h/mbh66h4k8rv4qwempdxdvmhxmdi.jpeg"><br><br>  Folk fantasy has already produced wonderful versions of the accident - that the drill was punched by a drill that had been lost in space in Soviet times, or a microscopic black hole, quickly evaporated by Hawking radiation, caused the hole. <br><br>  And it‚Äôs great that they remembered astronaut Mike Mullein's wonderful memoirs (although, having mixed up the name, he is not Robert, but Richard Michael). <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">16+</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/xy/wh/uy/xywhuywbnmv1umidpuekh1akdfu.jpeg"><br></div></div></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/422541/">https://habr.com/ru/post/422541/</a></p>
