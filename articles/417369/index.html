But this is only possible in theory or in an ideal world.  Experience, knowledge or managerial acumen may not be enough.  Then, universal and specialized tools and services come to the rescue, which facilitate PM tasks, increase process efficiency and make the product competitive.  What tools are necessary for the product manager to feel confident in the current market conditions? <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b80/852/1b7/b808521b7b1e0a431a0d3ddb6432ec16.jpg" alt="image"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Not so much time has passed since then, when product managers did not have ample opportunity to use intelligent platforms.  In fact, they had at their disposal only spreadsheets, PowerPoint, or the most primitive software for managing projects and products.  Today, everyone is chasing innovations, although for some, for example, it is still more convenient <a href="https://habr.com/company/hygger/blog/415271/">to build Gantt charts</a> for a product on plain paper or a blackboard. <br><br>  Currently, each product manager can choose among a variety of free and paid services and tools.  Modern software for product management helps in various areas:

This is not an ideal set, but a list of possible services and platforms, which can be easily supplemented or revised depending on the needs of the product, the target audience, market factors or other conditions. <br><br><h2>  15 strategic tools for a product manager </h2><br><h3>  Jira </h3><br>  Let's start with the classics.  Often, product teams need multifunctional services for complex, including technical solutions.  In this case, <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira">JIRA</a> is a classic management service.  Recently, however, many teams have abandoned this tool precisely because of its complexity and technicality.  Many marketers, designers or product managers will agree with this. <br><br>  JIRA is a popular platform for developers, managers and teams, helping to manage projects and products, setting and moving tasks, and communication in a team. <br>  Product launch can be a major challenge for any team.  JIRA does an excellent job of automating workflows, optimizing the most time-consuming tasks and helping to focus on the value of the product. <br><br>  Using JIRA, product managers can timely identify issues that matter most to their customers, view details and descriptions of the problems they encounter, comment or send emails directly when they need more detailed information. <br><br>  The service includes various functions that allow you to define a product vision and tasks related to building a roadmap, <a href="https://habr.com/company/hygger/blog/358080/">manage ideas in the backlog</a> , determine priorities and involve the team in writing a spec. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/3a5/0a5/c46/3a50a5c4612afc4c9bc147623e7a5251.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h3>  Confluence </h3><br>  <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/software/confluence">Confluence is</a> also a very popular software product designed to help teams effectively collaborate and share information. <br><br>  Confluence allows you to create pages and blogs that you can comment and edit to all team members who have access.  Here you can also attach files and display them on the page for more convenience. <br><br>  Many people need to develop, view, edit, comment and publish content as part of collaboration.  Confluence was designed to integrate with JIRA, and they have many points of contact. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/76f/b4d/a5d/76fb4da5d4169181a6f465e66f3af9ee.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h3>  Hygger </h3><br>  Product management, first of all, means making decisions about what you do with the product, and only then their implementation. <br><br>  <a href="https://hygger.io/%3Futm_source%3Dhabrahabr%26utm_medium%3Darticle%26utm_campaign%3DtoolsforPM">Hygger.io</a> is a quality alternative to JIRA for product technical and non-technical teams.  This is a universal management platform for fast-growing companies. <br><br>  The service helps <a href="https://habr.com/company/hygger/blog/354168/">to manage backlog</a> , create and fumble comfortable roadmaps, correctly apply feature <a href="https://habr.com/company/hygger/blog/359208/">prioritization</a> .
