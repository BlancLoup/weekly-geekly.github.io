  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Neurobiology innovations: mysterious giant neurons, laughter neurobiology and LSD potential</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Let's start with the news from everyone's favorite area of ‚Äã‚Äãpsychedelic research.  Scientists believe that they were able to decipher the <a href="http://www.cell.com/fulltext/S0092-8674(16)31749-4(16)31749-4">secret of the power of LSD</a> .  This substance can change your mind for a period of up to 18 hours, unlike, for example, DMT ( <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2594%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B5%25D1%2582%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BB%25D1%2582%25D1%2580%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BF%25D1%2582%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BD">dimethyltryptamine</a> ), another quite powerful psychedelic substance that can turn off the brain for only 15 minutes.  To understand the background, the researchers decided to analyze the behavior of LSD at the molecular level.  At first they waited for the LSD molecule to connect to the brain's serotonin receptor, and then they froze it in the form of a crystal.  After that, they built a three-dimensional image of the structure using x-rays.  It was there that they saw something unusual: typical drugs (and other molecules) enter and leave the receptors in much the same way as cars enter and leave the garage.  However, when LSD connected to the receptor, it covered one part of it like a lid.  This cap retained the molecule inside the receptor, thanks to which it was able to work on psychedelic sensations without interruption.  Protein receptors constantly fidget around it, so in the end, this cap opens and releases the molecule.  When scientists created a mutated receptor with a lid that opened much easier, they saw how LSD connected and disconnected much faster, and such a short-term connection caused other changes in the signals in the neuron.  Psychedelics have a promising potential for treating anxiety, depression, and addictions, so solving the LSD action method can help us correct them so as to get all the positive effects, and not send people to the <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucy_in_the_Sky_with_Diamonds">sky with diamonds</a> , as well as develop improved medicines and correct existing ones. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/b2e/929/d0b/b2e929d0bee527978e825fbb09dae464.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <i>An LSD molecule linked to a receptor.</i>  <i>Orange stick in the center - holding it "cover"</i> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  To other news.  Scientists have recently discovered something unusual in the brain.  Like ivy winding around a tree, the mouse brain <a href="http://www.nature.com/news/a-giant-neuron-found-wrapped-around-entire-mouse-brain-1.21539">hugged a giant neuron</a> .  It was connected to almost all sites in both hemispheres, and resembled the electrical network that supplies the city with electricity.  Moreover, two more giant neurons, actively branching out in the brain, took their origin in the same area as the first one. <br><br>  They started from a site called " <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259E%25D0%25B3%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B0_(%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B0%25D1%2582%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B8%25D1%258F)">fence</a> ", or "claustum" - a thin sheet of cells, and one of the sites with the most connections in the brain.  He helps us use cognitive functions such as long-term planning.  It has already been shown that claustrum is somehow related to consciousness (stimulation by electricity <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24967698">caused abrupt on and off consciousness</a> , and its damage correlated with the <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26186439">duration of loss of consciousness</a> ).  One of the authors of the work in question previously assumed that claustrum works like a conductor in an orchestra, combining all internal and external sensations into a complex perception.  If so, then these giant neurons can be considered proof of the role that claustum plays in consciousness.  The researchers plan to continue marking the neurons emanating from the claustrum to see if they all extend to the whole brain, or whether they are different in different areas.  And, although it was very interesting to find neurons, which, perhaps, serve as a powerful switch for conscious behavior, it is worthwhile to hold the horses and not produce sensations like ‚ÄúFOUNDED LOCATION OF CONSCIOUSNESS KINDLY !! 1‚Äù.  It will take a lot of time before these discoveries can be transferred to people, and decipher the mechanism behind such a miracle as our consciousness.

Found exactly how good comedians differ from your drunken uncle, telling jokes about the Chukchi (and me, writing this post).  <a href="http://journal.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fnhum.2016.00597/full">Researchers compared</a> experienced comedians improvisers with beginners to see where the brain contains creativity associated with humor.  To do this, the researchers scanned the subjects, while they came up with funny captions to the cartoons from the New Yorker.  It was found that in this process, two brain regions are active - the medial <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259F%25D1%2580%25D0%25B5%25D1%2584%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BD%25D1%2582%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BB%25D1%258C%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B0%25D1%258F_%25D0%25BA%25D0%25BE%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0_%25D0%25B3%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BB%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B3%25D0%25BE_%25D0%25BC%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B7%25D0%25B3%25D0%25B0">prefrontal cortex</a> (SEC) and portions of the temporal associative memory.  But the level of their activation depended on the experience of the comedian.  Experienced pranksters activated the part of associative memory much more actively, participating in the work of memory, semantic knowledge, combining information into complex context associations and recognizing language and visible objects.  Beginners relied more on SEC, the area responsible for decision making and planning.  It seemed that experience allows jokers to let go of control and allow free and spontaneous associations to behave, rather than trying to give a joke.  The rating of jokes was also higher, the more the memory area was activated.  I tried to invent a final joke, but my temporary associative memory let me down. <br><br>  And finally, futuristic news.  Scientists have managed to grow the brain out of discarded skin!  Nearly.  In fact, they <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28142205">turned skin cells</a> into neural stem cells from which neurons could grow.  And, unlike previous similar experiments, all this was done without genetic manipulation.  This is important because it means that this technology can help fight neurodegenerative diseases (like, ‚Äútake a little skin and replace all the cells that died because of Parkinson‚Äôs‚Äù), and that we can now study genetic diseases of the nervous system in vitro ‚Äî skin cells turning into neurons will carry the same genetic mutation, which leads to the disease, so real neurons in humans do not have to take. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/373373/">https://habr.com/ru/post/373373/</a></p>
