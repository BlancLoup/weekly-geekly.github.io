In winter, I visited Riga, where a German arrived from Germany and gave a lecture on Twitter.  Most of all, he didn‚Äôt want someone to think that he was somehow connected with Twitter, and simply repeated that, they say, ‚ÄúI love Twitter‚Äù.  Here it is, by the way: <br><br><img src="http://roiber.ru/html/resource/images/articles/16/1.jpg"><br><br>  Let's see what is the reason for the popularity of this service and what makes people spend time on its development and use, increasingly baring their personal life.

      Here's what they say about Twitter "Internet stuff": <br><blockquote>  If you are a very sociable person and online communication does not pretend to replace the living, then the Twitter service is what you need, and also if it becomes harder and harder for you to keep track of what your comrades are doing, being online or beyond. <br>  Twitter is a service that helps you keep your own news feed on the Internet, a mini-blog, if you like, which does not cancel, but only complements the ‚Äúbig brother‚Äù.  You can either send your life events yourself or use the automatic system built into Twitter, which will ask you ‚Äúwhat are you doing at the moment?‚Äù, And you will only have to answer ‚ÄúI eat sushi, I drink sake‚Äù. <br><br></blockquote><br>  Those.  All that makes this service - notifies your friends about the status that you send to the service Twitter.  By the way, the length of each message should be no more than 140 characters.  Anyone who calls your friends and watches your updates will see your new status almost instantly.  You can reply to messages and send private messages to all your recipients.  You can consider this group "ICQ".  EVERYTHING!  At this basic functionality of the service ends :) <br>  The whole power of Twitter lies in its versatility, as well as in the simplicity of its API.  Posting to Twitter you can: <br><ul><li>  From Twitter.com. </li><li>  By SMS.  Updates of your chosen friends will come directly to your phone, and you will be able to send your status as an SMS message, only to a British number, which does not always equal the local tariff to which you are accustomed - beware of this.  By the way, you can send no more than 250 SMS per month. </li><li>  From any messenger: ICQ, Google Talk, MSN, Jabber, Yahoo!  Messenger and others. </li><li>  From a multitude of clients written specifically for Twitter enthusiasts.  Usually the best clients appear under the Adobe AIR launch environment, but there are also native applications for all popular operating systems.  By the way, the most popular clients - Twhirl, Spaz, Snitter, Alert Thingy - work under AIR, and it is for Windows, MacOSX and Linux. </li><li>  With a special browser plugin, for example, the plugin for Firefox MySocial 24x7, and the Flock browser supports Twitter out of the box. </li><li>  From web services that interact with the Twitter API and implement all of its functionality, but in a more convenient interface.  The most striking such service is Hahlo.com, which can be used both on the local machine and on smartphones.  It is especially good on the Apple iPhone. </li></ul><br>  In fact, it is impossible to list all the services and programs, but you can learn about them directly on the Twitter website. <br>  Mashups are those services that actively use the powers of other services in their work, interacting with them according to a specially created set of commands and instructions, which are commonly called APIs.  So, thousands of mashups were created for Twitter.  Only some of them can be found <a href="http://internetno.net/2007/10/04/twitter-tools/">here</a> . <br>  In addition, great visualizations are available to Twitter users who can build graphs of your activity in the service, show the globe and tweets of users with reference to countries, build the frequency of mentioning a particular company, and <a href="http://internetno.net/2008/03/17/luchshie-vizualizatsii-dlya-twitter/">much more</a> . <br><br><img src="http://roiber.ru/html/resource/images/articles/16/2.jpg"><br><br>  Another ‚Äútrick‚Äù of Twitter can be considered bots - special automatic ‚Äúusers‚Äù who inform you of information of interest in response to a structured request to them.  For example, add events to your Google Calendar in one line, get weather reports for your region, search for recipes for the entered ingredients, view the status of shipments by DHL, FedEX, and <a href="http://internetno.net/2008/04/16/twitter-bots/">more</a> .  Bots, by the way, are also the work of enthusiasts. <br>  If you read a lot of blogs, then it makes sense to add announcements of popular blogs to your friends list on Twitter, and you will be the first to read the news.  Such cross-posters have TechCrunch, ZDNet, Mashable, CNN and many others.  Just take a look;) <br>  Twitter can also &lt;a href = " <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2008/04/16/twitter-saves-man-from-egyptian-justice/">www.techcrunch.com/2008/04/16/twitter-saves-man-from-egyptian-justice</a> " <br>  target = "_ blank"&gt; save you from an Egyptian prison.  The man simply sent a message that he was arrested, and in his friends there was someone who pulled him out. <br><br><img src="http://roiber.ru/html/resource/images/articles/16/3.jpg"><br><br>  In conclusion, we note that Twitter is flourishing and growing wildly.  A certain community of highly motivated developers and grateful users built around him, who immediately tweet the most interesting things that happen to them in life.  Look for such people too: among them there are characters who have never been reached before in real life. <br><br>  Vyacheslav Baransky <br>  <strong>Source: <u><a href="http://roiber.ru/articles/">Royber PC</a></u></strong> <br></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/29451/">https://habr.com/ru/post/29451/</a></p>
