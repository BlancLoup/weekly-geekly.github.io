  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The Chinese are so Chinese</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  This post was inspired by an unexpected for me habranaleniya <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/mosigra/blog/113876/">post to the</a> distinguished <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/milfgard/" class="user_link">Milfgard</a> from Mosigra about production in China.  The fact is that one of my interests in the production of batteries is <a href="http://www.denaq.com/">Denaq</a> .  And the production is located well, of course, in China.  I will not talk about the organization of production, there are some great tricks there.  I'll tell you exactly about ordering something for yourself and buying all kinds of wholesale.  Something like an algorithm adorned with real stories from personal experience.  All this will be about electronics, as I myself am engaged in it.  Stories and illustrations I will italicize.  Who is bored to read general conclusions - read only them. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h5>  Common words. </h5><br><h6>  What makes sense to order in China </h6><br>  <i>What would be better understood: In the city of Shenzhen, which is directly opposite Hong Kong, a subway is being built.</i>  <i>Hands</i>  <i>A pile of working shovels depicts a mining combine, and a pile with wheelbarrows - a conveyor that pulls away the soil.</i>  <i>Because the harvester is expensive.</i>  <i>And the Chinese for 70 bucks a month are also happy that there is work.</i>  <i>And there are 1.2 billion of them.</i> <br>  To order there is a sense of a product with a high proportion of manual labor in value.  These are small-scale production or when the assortment of assembly operations is huge.  Say toys - a great example.  They are all different, for each typewriter wheels cling to a slightly different place, respectively, a cheap Chinese worker is much more affordable than an automatic line.  For a person does not need to reconfigure when changing products, but the line is necessary.  Goods with a high proportion of operations requiring machine precision, on the contrary, do not need to order in China.  For there it is expensive and they will always try to replace the expensive car with cheap Chinese.  It is better to take Japanese or Korean cells in my batteries - for good cells are made in clean production with more than 85% mechanization.  But it is already better to assemble cells into batteries in China, since there are many different batteries and it is necessary to arrange cells in them in different ways. <br><br><h6>  China is a poor country, and therefore disciplined. </h6><br>  <i>I once drove a car between Shenzhen and Foshan.</i>  <i>I watch a naked man walking along the side of the road.</i>  <i>Well, not completely naked, on it something like an old, old bag from under the potato is taut, but the gaps there are such that his ass could be seen in every detail.</i>  <i>Here he goes, sparkling rolls.</i>  <i>At first I thought it was not enough, the local madman can.</i>  <i>Fortunately, the climate allows Golyak to run all year round.</i>  <i>I marveled at the local erotica, and then looked around.</i>  <i>And around the fields people in the same outfits.</i>  <i>Unwashed Teles sparkle temptingly through the gaps.</i> <br>  About 70% of the population lives in this state.  Shanghai, Shenzhen - this is all for 30% only.  Another thing is that these 30% of the 1.2 billion people are equal to the population of the United States and twice the size of Russia.  But on the whole, there is iron order in the production there precisely because of the place of any worker there is a queue of almost a billion volunteers.  Let him just squeak or try to go to work drunk.

    <h6>  China is an uneducated country </h6><br>  <i>Communicating with Russians living in China, I noticed that they all speak fluent Chinese even by telephone.</i>  <i>However, they are not able to read a single inscription.</i>  <i>This surprised me, especially when I learned that even people who have lived in China for some three months speak fluently.</i> <br>  If you get into the reference books, then there are two Chinese languages ‚Äã‚Äãmentioned: cantonis and mandarin.  So actually there are three languages.  There is also the so-called "simplified Chinese."  Those bare workers in the fields speak it.  It is very easy to learn, since there are literally a few hundred vocabulary there, and all the sentences are no more difficult than ‚Äúmommy washed the frame‚Äù.  The average Chinese, that is the average in the country, dressed in a bag, does not understand Chinese television.  But this is not a problem, since he still does not have a TV.  As a result, sometimes the Chinese give the impression of unusually stupid people who do not understand the obvious things.  This is not a cultural difference.  You ran into a native from the fields.  He's really stupid. <br><br>  We finish with verbiage and get down to business. <br><br><h5>  The course of the order.  Initial search for a manufacturer. </h5><br><h6>  Alibaba.com </h6><br>  First of all, you go to the mecca of the Chinese industry - alibaba.com.  There are a huge number of manufacturers ... schaz!  Dreaming.  Almost all represented there are dealers.  And small.  These are college boys who have learned English and are trying to build their way into life.  Factories belong to older people, they don't speak English.  In factories, there are even such open office spaces equipped with a computer and an IP phone, where they are allowed to such boys to come and spud clients.  They all sit on the percentage of transactions.  And they carry a hidden risk.  Vaughn, in <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/mosigra/blog/113876/">comments</a> comrade <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/rednaxi/" class="user_link">rednaxi</a> tells a story about cylinders.  How it turned out in reality.  The boy ordered these simulators for him at the factory.  They were delivered with cheap cylinders.  The boy persuaded the manufacturer to then send expensive cylinders promising either payment or a greater flow of orders, but broke off.  And so, later the problem got out. <br><br><h6>  Exhibitions </h6><br>  Several times a year in China, or rather in Hong Kong, two major electronics exhibitions are held.  <a href="http://www.hktdc.com/fair/hkelectronicsfairse-en/HKTDC-Hong-Kong-Electronics-Fair-Spring-Edition.html">Here</a> it <a href="http://tradeshow.globalsources.com/TRADESHOW/HONGKONG-ELECTRONICS.HTM">is</a> .  One passes right near the airport (it is convenient to settle in Regal, at the airport), the second in the center.  Free buses run from the airport to the one in the center.  Exhibitions compete and are always held almost simultaneously.  It is impossible to miss, right at the airport you are met by girls in branded shirts with banners.  It is better to register in advance.  You need to take a bunch of business cards with you and remember - in China it is decent to serve a business card with two hands!  One is ostentatious neglect.  Exhibitions are much better now, there are no boys there, but second-hand dealers are there.  However, more solid.  Manufacturers are also present.  Preparing for the exhibition do not be lazy to see last year's participants.  Small beginner dealers have this year, but they are not in the past. <br>  Immediately after the exhibition, you can move to China by car.  There is a bridge, the road is about 45 minutes.  Just get to Shenzhen.  Behind the airport, in Bao'an, the vast majority of factories are located.  They need to inspect. <br><br><h6>  Production check </h6><br>  So, you have chosen potential partners from the exhibition or on alibabe.  Now is the time to conduct a production inspection.  You can inspect yourself, or you can send a special person for some two hundred dollars.  <a href="http://asiainspection.com/">Asiainspection.com</a> provides a similar service.  So, if you have serious intentions, do not even think about it!  The inspector from asiainspection is a small-headed man on a small salary who does not care about the result.  And if he shoved a hundred bucks into his paw, then he writes in a report that he himself is interested in reading - which, however, my production is good.  You need to check yourself.  However, you still need to understand what you are checking. <br>  <i>The batteries have temperature sensors.</i>  <i>They should kill the battery with signs of overheating.</i>  <i>In cheap models sold in ibey they are not.</i>  <i>I once talked in a factory in a beautiful meeting room and asked: ‚Äúdo you have temperature sensors in batteries?‚Äù.</i>  <i>"Oh yes yes!</i>  <i>Of course have!".</i>  <i>But then a Chinese girl ran.</i>  <i>I know what they look like and in front of her eyes I broke one battery on my knee, examined the board and what did you think?</i> <br>  In general, during the inspection, the Chinese use your ignorance of the language and lie desperately.  To begin with, you can be shown a factory with the words ‚ÄúOh!  This is my factory!  I'm the commercial director here! ‚ÄùA boy from Alibaba.  The owners are allowed to deceive naive laovai by showing them the fields of the Marquis of Karabas. <br>  <i>Once I had to visit two factories.</i>  <i>After visiting one in the evening in the hotel, I received a call from the second person.</i>  <i>He was hysterically trying to explain that I had already seen the factory, that in fact she was not of that first guy, but of him.</i>  <i>In fact, the factory generally belonged to the third.</i> <br>  The Chinese are conspiring as you would rather lie right in front of you.  Why not?  Anyway, you don‚Äôt understand anything.  This is a very big minus.  If you went to work and learned a little Chinese, then in no case do not show it.  Hear a lot of interesting things.  The main thing is to watch the face, so as not to give yourself. <br>  <i>Once, when I had to go around a bunch of factories, I hired a Russian girl living in China who was married to a Chinese and who also spoke a little English.</i>  <i>And we went to Fariki with her.</i>  <i>Now we have had the advantage of linguistic.</i>  <i>I strictly forbade her to demonstrate knowledge of the language.</i>  <i>We came to the factory, I spoke in English, she burkala Hello and silently followed me playing the role of a secretary tagging everything said in a notebook.</i>  <i>Only she marked not what we spoke with the representative of the factory in English, but the fact that they spoke Chinese in between.</i>  <i>In critical cases, when the situation demanded an immediate response, she gave me news in Russian.</i>  <i>This was especially ironic, as the Chinese thought that she did say something in English, just quickly and they did not understand.</i>  <i>We naturally did not warn them that we speak a third language.</i>  <i>Oh, how many interesting things I learned on that trip.</i> <br>  We must also understand the production, which you inspect.  You can build a whole Potemkin village and pass it off for just what you are looking for. <br>  <i>Once I was in production, which I was given for the production of batteries.</i>  <i>We come, everyone is sitting with smart mugs, collect batteries.</i>  <i>On the tables are batteries.</i>  <i>Only they are in stock.</i>  <i>But the equipment looked unbalanced.</i>  <i>There stood two soldering machines to roll up the boards and just one machine for sealing the cases.</i>  <i>In batteries, the handkerchiefs are tiny.</i>  <i>Only large factories can afford their own soldering equipment for it is expensive and its performance is measured in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe boards.</i>  <i>On one soldering station should be about ten sealing machines.</i>  <i>Well, I see this and ask, as they say so, why?</i>  <i>The Chinese shu-shu among themselves and answer that they say just on the cheap from a bankrupt enterprise bought and therefore two immediately took.</i>  <i>For the future, they say.</i>  <i>And this was the case with the Russian girl.</i>  <i>She gives me their shu-shu and translates.</i>  <i>In fact, the Chinese expressed surprise that they were not the usual nicheta who did not understand the dibil came and were glad that all the TV tuners had been hidden in boxes on the upper shelves.</i>  <i>Should I say that I immediately brazenly climbed up the racks, fished out a couple of boards and asked me to clarify what semi-assembled tuners are doing in the production of batteries.</i> <br>  Generally proceed from the fact that you always lie in China.  Everything.  Is always.  You are in a hostile territory and they want to fuck you.  Use the entire arsenal of spies from movies.  In addition to blatant lies in the forehead, there may be industrial fakes.  About fake Rolex here everyone probably knows?  And about fake battery cells? <br>  <i>Once, at a battery factory, I was offered surprisingly good prices for batteries with Japanese cells.</i>  <i>The explanation was simple: the owner of the factory had been 10 years in the cell business and knows all the moves and exits.</i>  <i>Well, during the inspection of the factory, I went to piss (ladies, sorry for physiological similarity, but you know the word from the song).</i>  <i>Nobody piddled me in the toilet, politely showed that the pier was at the end of the cordier.</i>  <i>And leaving the toilet I ‚Äúgot lost‚Äù having escaped from the attendants and began to cut circles in the factory.</i>  <i>And what would you think?</i>  <i>Cells from different manufacturers are dressed in plastic in different colors.</i>  <i>At a hidden corner, I found naked Chinese cells that put them on plastic machines and pink plastic deposits ‚Äî the color of Samsung.</i>  <i>This bastard took the cheapest Chinese cells and disguised them then giving out for the Samsung.</i> <br>  If you have a very bad preparation process, then take a camera and a voice recorder with you.  Recorder hid in your pocket and write everything you say.  This is nothing that you do not understand a word.  Then give it to the translator, he will translate to you.  You take out the camera and honestly ask for permission to shoot the production.  But make a significant part of the frame by pointing the lens at the labels, signs and markings.  Especially in stock.  Then give them to the translator too.  So you can find out that the XiaoBiao factory, which was shown to you and on whose behalf they billed, is actually LiaoMiao at all, as signboards and address stickers say on incoming goods.  What a good price you have been given is only the result of a planned fraud, when the promised Texas Instrument chips will be replaced with something much cheaper. <br><br>  So I summarize: study your subject and the process of its production.  Do not skimp on translators and use imagination.  Do not relax loaves and remember - you are from the country which gave the world to Stierlitz. <br><br><h5>  Equipment </h5><br>  <i>Once we ordered furniture.</i>  <i>On the whole building at once.</i>  <i>She came, we unpack the first cabinet, and there are no fasteners.</i>  <i>We unpack the second - no.</i>  <i>It turns out the good Chinese put all the accessories in a single box.</i>  <i>We had to pull apart all the boxes into rooms and unpack them there, hoping to finally find the damn box with screws and pens.</i>  <i>In the same cargo were bedside tables.</i>  <i>Drawer rails for drawers lay separately.</i>  <i>Bedside tables were not even marked out.</i>  <i>Here you sit and customize as you wish.</i> <br>  Here we must understand the difference between them and our worldview.  In the USA, where the furniture has gone, the work of a person capable of marking all these bedside tables without errors costs several hundred a day.  There the work was for three days, count 1000 dollars.  For three days a Chinese worker costs only $ 5‚Äì10 for a host.  Accordingly, when you are trying to swear about such cases, your Chinese counterparty is genuinely perplexed: have you just paid $ 20,000 and are now calling you because of working for a couple of bucks? <br>  This is especially true of things that your buyers will have to collect at home.  Do not trust the design of such a Chinese.  Personally do the assembly instructions.  Otherwise, you will rummage. <br>  <i>Once, two centimeters caused large losses.</i>  <i>People ordered cabinets from three sections in China.</i>  <i>Here it is necessary to <a href="">look</a> at the <a href="">picture</a> .</i>  <i>As you can see the cabinet is completely symmetrical.</i>  <i>Sidewalls are different in that they have holes under the keys for the shelves on one side only.</i>  <i>But the two middle vertical posts are almost symmetrical.</i>  <i>It is almost - for the holes for the shelves they have at different heights inside and outside.</i>  <i>Can you see the bottom view?</i>  <i>In Europe, civilized Germans simply cut these holes for mounting racks to the base and to the cover in different ways.</i>  <i>From above, the distance between the holes, say 15 centimeters, and below - 16. And the holes themselves are not located symmetrically, but are shifted to some kind of edge.</i>  <i>As a result, turn this rack and assemble the cabinet with it turned upside down - it becomes physically impossible.</i>  <i>And the Chinese brothers drilled holes on Feng Shui, equally and symetrically.</i>  <i>Now it became possible to stick each rack in four ways.</i>  <i>Two racks.</i>  <i>1/4 * 1/4 = 1/16 - that is exactly how many chances the layman had to assemble the cabinet without error.</i>  <i>A special Jesuit was that in such an overturned cabinet the shelves so fell into place, but at a slight angle.</i>  <i>Created the full impression of marriage.</i>  <i>Spoiled American buyers in large quantities returned goods as defective.</i>  <i>Can you imagine what share in the furniture trade is the cost of shipping it?</i> <br><br><h5>  intellectual property </h5><br>  Well, in short, it's just not there.  And it's not even that they steal from you.  The Chinese do not even consider it a theft.  They stole from you and do not consider it necessary to hide it from you.  In their understanding, this is like a joke to retell a good one.  We‚Äôre not offended when the listener tells you a joke after 5 minutes to tell someone else.  Well, they have it all. <br>  <i>Once I designed a very special package.</i>  <i>Himself sat, vymeryal, drew.</i>  <i>We ordered something at an outside factory, everything went spinning, deliveries went and during one of the visits the factory employee promises me to send samples of everything new that they will produce.</i>  <i>As free samples.</i>  <i>And then he takes me to a couple of samples in the boxes of my design.</i>  <i>She is not confused, not pierced.</i>  <i>She shows me my boxes already with their labels and so directly into my face and says that they liked my design so much that they decided to respect me and send the samples to all their customers in the packaging of my design.</i> <br><br>  W-FF.  It happened a long time.  Well, if anything, ask questions.  I'll tell you what I know. <br><br><h5>  Glossary of terms: </h5><br>  <a href="http://www.denaq.com/">Denaq</a> - make batteries and adapters for laptops. <br>  Cell - there they are <a href="http://www.google.com/images%3Fq%3D18650">on google</a> .  From them going to a laptop battery.  Pink is samsung, simny is Pray.  Well, or fake them. <br>  Battery - meaning a laptop battery. <br>  Why is there a temperature sensor in the battery - <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DQJCZ4ayioCU">that's why</a> .  Whatever this was. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/114014/">https://habr.com/ru/post/114014/</a></p>
