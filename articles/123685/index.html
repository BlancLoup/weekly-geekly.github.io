  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Hold me now</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Greetings to you, habrazhiteli! <br>  Any owner of a plastic card and an active user of the Internet bank at least once observed in his account statement the column ‚ÄúReserved funds‚Äù and the n-th sum of money opposite to it.  If at the same time you are in a panic, thinking: ‚ÄúWhat is this money?  Why, by whom and - most importantly - for what are they reserved ??? ‚Äù, it means that you have never heard of holding.  Or heard, but did not know "what it is and what it is eaten with."  Calm  You have us, and now we will tell you everything.  <s>Chip and Dale</s> SMP Bank to the rescue! <a name="habracut"></a><br>  Holding is a procedure in which the bank ‚Äúfreezes‚Äù the amount of money you spent on the card at the time of cashless payment, and it becomes unavailable for use.  Full cancellation occurs only after some time: As a rule, the next day, but the maximum period is 30-35 days (depending on the bank, whose POS-terminal is installed in a shop, hairdresser, hotel, etc.). acquirer).  That is, during this period, the amount "hangs" in your account: you can not use it, and the company does not receive it immediately. <br>  The holding process accompanies virtually any payment card transaction.  With rare exceptions: there are so-called unauthorized operations without holding (for example, on board an aircraft).  The withdrawal of funds does not occur immediately.  After the cashier passes your card through the POS terminal, your bank receives information about the transaction and blocks the purchase amount, which is marked in the statement as ‚ÄúReserved funds‚Äù.  If in the process of shopping you have found a more suitable thing or just decided to return the goods, the money will be unblocked as soon as the cashier cancels the transaction, provided that you returned the goods on the same day, and the acquiring bank has not yet received information about the transaction). <br>  If you have ever booked a hotel over the Internet, you are also faced with holding.  By clicking on the cherished button "Reserve", with one click of the mouse you give the hotel the opportunity to block a certain amount on your card.  However, at the entrance you should remind the girl (or boy) at the reception, so that the full amount of the stay is deducted from the card taking into account the hold - otherwise you can remain without the ‚Äúfrozen‚Äù amount for 30-35 days until the reservation is canceled .  If you didn‚Äôt take care of it, and you need money right away, you will have to contact the bank for help with documents from the hotel or car rental company: an invoice from the hotel indicating the dates of entry and exit, or an agreement for renting a car with an imprint of your card and specifying the amount of payment, invoices issued for services and checks confirming their payment.  If you keep these documents, it is likely that the bank will be able to ‚Äúrelease‚Äù your money, and you will again be able to freely dispose of them. <br>  If you often travel around Europe, it makes sense to open a card with a currency account, because if the currency of your account is rubles, the blocked money will be written off at the rate of the debit date and the change in the exchange rate may not be in your favor. <br>  Booked a hotel or car and decided to cancel the reservation?  If in this case the company itself has not unblocked the amount, and you do not want to wait 30-35 days for your money, you can contact the bank with a letter confirming the cancellation of the reservation.  Did not receive?  We'll have to somehow request it from the company - for example, by e-mail. <br>  Holding is a rather complicated and multi-step process.  It happens like this: The client gave the cashier a card to pay for the goods or services =&gt; When the cashier passes the card through the POS terminal, the terminal sends the card data to his bank (acquirer) =&gt; The acquiring bank (who installed the POS terminal) sends the request to the payment the system, in turn, sends it to the issuing bank (the bank that issued your card) =&gt; The issuing bank verifies the card's solvency and permits payment (authorizes) =&gt; <u>The funds are being deposited</u> =&gt; The issuing bank sends approval information operations in the payment si  The system that sends it to the acquiring bank is, in turn, sent to the point of sale =&gt; A check is formed at the POS terminal - the operation has been approved. <br>  We hope that now the phrase ‚ÄúReserved funds‚Äù will stop plunging you into shock.  "Read" statement - be an advanced user.  Next time we will continue the topic of ‚Äúdecrypting‚Äù the account statement. </div>
