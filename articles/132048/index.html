      <i>The first embodiment of the device (hardware-software).</i> <br><br>  ‚ÄúRadioAska‚Äù (‚ÄúGeoAska‚Äù) is an electronic digital wireless device, the main purpose of which is to provide convenient exchange of information within a specified range.  The main difference from the existing mobile wireless communications devices is that they communicate on the same principle as ICQ, regardless of the availability of the Internet within the range of RadioAskie.  The second main feature is the ability to contact any interlocutor with the same device that is in range. <br><br>  <i>The second embodiment of the device (software).</i> <br><br>  The operation of the device using existing platforms - GPS + 3G (EDGE, Internet) + software protocol and client that implements the required interactions, as well as the user interface.  It is necessary to develop the RadioAsski software server here, since information about the location of clients, authentication and message transfer will be centralized.  Then the hardware base of the device can be any mobile phone (smartphone), PC, laptop or other device, including the platforms listed above and the RadioAskki client software.  For this option, the range is unlimited. <br><br>  In the absence of an automatic user location module (GPS), it is possible to manually or semi-automatically (by IP address) determine (refine, confirm) the coordinates of the RadioAski client, for example, using Google or Yandex maps when the client is initialized. <br><br>  <b>Problem</b> <br><br>  Existing communication tools for the most part allow you to communicate with interlocutors whose unique identifier we need to know in advance - for example, a mobile phone number, a number or a nickname in ICQ-like protocols, an e-mail in an e-mail and, as a rule, without reference to the subscriber‚Äôs changing geographic location .  The only exception is communication in chat rooms, where the opportunity to write to an unfamiliar interlocutor was originally laid.  On the one hand, the presence of such a mandatory identifier is not a particular problem and has many advantages, but on the other hand it hinders communication. <br><br>  The second nuance of the use of existing mobile communications is tightly tied to the means of data transmission and the platforms providing them.  For example, if two owners of mobile phones are in the zone where the base station is broken or there is no coverage, they will not be able to communicate with each other via mobile communication.  If two people with computers are sitting in the neighboring rooms in a building without communication lines, then in this case their computers cease to be means of communication. <br><br>  The third disadvantage of existing competing systems (SMS, ICQ, etc.) - does not use information about the changing geographic location of users, which in many cases would significantly expand the functionality of the platforms and protocols used for communication and dating at a distance, bringing even more social component. <br><br>  <b>Decision</b> <br><br>  The correct operation of the first embodiment of RadioAskie depends only on the availability of power, on the health of the device itself and naturally on the absence of interference in the radio broadcast of a given range.  It is possible to find out everything (or almost everything, since the possibility of ‚Äúinvisibility‚Äù and blocking spam are built into the operation of the device) unique identifiers of potential interlocutors in a given radius of action and only then decide whether to use them or not.  Independence from existing communication platforms for the first embodiment of the device, broadcasting and linking to a changing geographic location for both implementation options are the main features of RadioAsska, designed to be an alternative to existing mobile tools and communications programs. <br><br>  <b>How does it work and looks?</b> <br><br>  The essence of the device is a convenient exchange of text messages, "smiles", media files, and also voice messages with interlocutors who have the same device (and / or) software client.  The first implementation of RadioAski has a limited range (no more than 1 km), and limited power that does not violate international standards and operates in the ‚Äúfree‚Äù (not requiring licensing) radio range.  The main difference from SMS technology in mobile communication is the ability to send messages to any interlocutor (and receive messages from any interlocutor) within range of the device.  The peculiarity of this device is its broadcasting, and hence, as a result, the ability to block individual interlocutors who abuse this property, for example by spam, and intrusive advertising. <br><br>  Like any device, ‚ÄúRadioAska‚Äù has its own set of interfaces for interacting with the outside world - with the user, and with other devices.  Externally, ‚ÄúRadioAska‚Äù may resemble a smartphone - the presence of a display (information output) and information input means (keyboard, touchscreen, etc.) is required.  The virtual (software) user interaction interface is the manager of all (!) Contacts currently in range of the device with the ability to write a text message with smiles, send a media file or make a call.  At the request of the user, the history of correspondence and the archive of contacts is saved. <br><br>  For the second implementation of the device, the software client will combine the functions of an ICQ-like protocol with displaying all already familiar interlocutors on-line regardless of the distance to them, plus displaying information about new potential interlocutors within a given radius with a center at the point corresponding to the actual or future location of the subscriber. <br>  Opportunities provided by geo-referencing interlocutors should be used most fully for both implementation options of RadioAski.  For example, displaying information about the location of all contacts located on-line, automatic calculation of the approximate distance to each of the interlocutors, showing the closest interlocutors and calculating the direction to them, etc., etc. <br><br>  <b>Market</b> <br><br>  Anyone who likes to chat and meet at a distance and not very distance.  Fans of other options for game communication can also be attributed here. <br><br>  <b>Business model</b> <br><br>  1. The release of the software implementation of the device.  Development of the transfer protocol, software, rights protection, marketing, sales of software options for the implementation of the device.  Two client options are free with restrictions.  Paid - with full functionality.  Sales licenses. <br>  2. Transition to the hardware and software implementation of the device.  Design, broadcast protocol, software, rights protection, prototyping, marketing, sales. <br><br>  <b>Competitors</b> <br><br>  Existing mobile telecommunications. <br><br>  <b>Budget and benchmarks</b> <br><br>  There should be a table with the size of the required investment for each of the control points of the project, showing also that they will represent the product and business at the specified time. <br><br>  Self-sufficiency of the project comes in 2.5 - 3 years <br><br>  <b>Team</b> <br><br>  Ivan Ivanov, the author of the project. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/132048/">https://habr.com/ru/post/132048/</a></p>
