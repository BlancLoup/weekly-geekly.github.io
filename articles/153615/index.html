  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Nokia Plan B (take 2)?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Recently, the Finnish startup Jolla, made up of former employees of Nokia‚Äôs Maemo &amp; MeeGo division, announced this summer, sent out an official press release informing the media that the young company was able to attract 200 million euros to develop MeeGo-based operating system and production of smartphones under its control.  Interest in the Finnish startup showed Hong Kong IT-cluster Cyberport.  The operating system was called Sailfish, which means Sailfish in the reload (the name of the company itself, I recall, is translated as Boat).  Smartphones promise in the spring of 2013. And literally it just became known that on November 21-22, the interface of the new OS will be presented in Helsinki and the SDK toolkit for application development will be available. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/94d/9b1/239/94d9b12398eb8c0770c0a028fc4ee0dc.jpg" alt="image">

      Parallel to this information, another, indirectly related to Nokia, appeared: allegedly Microsoft is going to release its own smartphones running WP8.  At Nokia, Microsoft doesn‚Äôt know anything about these plans.  Nevertheless, all the same profile media again spoke about the fact that Microsoft once again wants to substitute Nokia.  Let me remind you that such conversations took place at the end of June and the beginning of July of this year, when, after the presentation of WP8, it turned out that the previously released Nokia smartphones on WP7.5 would not receive a full upgrade to WP8.  It was then that rumors about some Plan B, which Nokia allegedly has, in case Microsoft is not the most friendly partner, or something goes wrong with WP8. <br><br>  It was absolutely obvious to me that Nokia‚Äôs Linux development, though not massive, but cult in certain circles, could become the basis of such a Plan B.  Mass, is a profitable business, where it is more important that authority is the basis for this mass character.  Steve Jobs, too, is not from scratch built the current popularity of Apple.  It is unlikely that he would have succeeded if Apple had no fan cores, a fan community.  It was this fan community (whose members were, among others, very influential people) who popularized the new Apple products. <br><br>  Proceeding from this confidence, I wrote a <a href="http://www.nomobile.ru/opinion/166554.html">column on Nomobile.ru</a> about what this notorious Plan B Nokia could be, the column is not so much a journalistic as a conspiracy, but on the other hand, conspiracy is only a dramatic technique, but journalism - one of the varieties of drama.  And so, literally a day after the release of this column, events began to occur, which can be viewed as Plan B as well, but it is possible - exactly the opposite: as a complete collapse of my conspiracy conclusions.  Anyway, already a week later on the IT-horizon an unknown company appeared (although it was formed at the end of 2011) by the company Jolla.  At some point, it even turned out that Nokia had transferred Jolla all the necessary patents to support Maemo &amp; MeeGo devices released by the Finnish IT giant, but by the evening this rumor had been refuted: no one gave anything to anyone, Nokia said. <br><br>  Puzzled by everything that happened, I wrote <a href="http://www.nomobile.ru/opinion/167442.html">another column on Nomobile.ru</a> , in which I tried to bring rational-pragmatic intonation into the events, they say, and why would Nokia not really hand over the necessary rights to Jolla to support Maemo5 and MeeGo Harmattan (N900 smartphones, N950, N9), but not at no cost (with what, in fact, why?), But on a completely commercial one.  Let Nokia and develop, thus, bring profit.  But, of course, there was no reaction to my admonitions.  But, after some time, Nokia sold Qt, which it acquired in 2008, and sold it to the Finnish company Digia.  By the way, the first 10 million euros for which Jolla was formed were also of Finnish origin. <br><br>  On the eve of the joint presentation of WP8-smartphones by Nokia and Microsoft, photos of a qwerty-smartphone on MeeGo called Lauta suddenly appeared on the network - allegedly it was ready for release along with the N9 and N950.  Why this, I thought.  Will Nokia present a smartphone on MeeGo at a joint presentation with Microsoft?  And in general, what is really Jolla: the project of Nokia itself, or the team of separatists who separated from the empire?  And why from the very beginning of Jolla CEO Jussi Hurmola insisted that the startup under his leadership would not support N9?  And why, then, despite these statements, does Jolla make extensive use of Nokia products on Maemo and MeeGo in their advertisements?  And Nokia is silent, as if everything is as it should be? <br><br>  Here, for example, video released by Jolla: <br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/zjwrg_UToRc%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700023,15700186,15700190,15700253,15700255,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhhfG2Hc2vYBOs0cAt1WUgsUq9UKWg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  On September 5, Nokia introduced two of the coolest smartphones on WP8.  This amount of innovation in the products was not a single one for a very long time.  Naturally, not a word was said about the smartphone on MeeGo.  And on September 8, was scheduled some presentation Jolla.  Have you already made a prototype?  - I thought it was.  But no, the presentation actually turned out to be more like a conference or a seminar where the future of the MerProject project was discussed, the developments of which are planned to be used in the new OS, now called Sailfish.  And this is despite the fact that MerProject is far from the only project developing on the basis of smartphones released by Nokia with pre-installed Linux operating systems.  In the Maemo.org repositories, for example, there <a href="http://repository.maemo.org/meego/Nemo/0.20120517.1.NEMO.2012-05-21.1/images/">is a Nemo Linux distribution kit</a> , intended for installation on the N900 and N950. <br><br>  In general, the devil himself will break his leg, as they say.  Not really understand anything. <br>  Jussi Hurmola from the outset stated that the new OS from Jolla will support applications from PlayMarket for Android.  However, in this regard, it is interesting to recall another statement, this time already the CEO of Nokia Stephen Elop.  Once, after the release of the N9, he said that MeeGo is the operating system of the future, this is what mobile devices will look like in the future. <br><br>  Honestly, watching how actively the base of applications for N9 is developing, what applications appear in ovi.store for N9, I somehow believe him.  No other platform has such multifunctional clients Twetter, YouTube, SoundCloud, etc. Compared to them, similar applications for Android and iOS really seem like a past century. <br><br>  Perhaps by the end of the year there will be some clarity in all this intricate history.  Personally, I still would very much like Jolla to preserve the continuity of Nokia's Linux devices, and Nokia, in turn, helped her in this, on mutually beneficial conditions, of course.  The Maemo &amp; MeeGo project has always been a kind of autonomy, a laboratory as part of Nokia.  Or Nokia plans to release its smartphone on MeeGo Harmattan? </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/153615/">https://habr.com/ru/post/153615/</a></p>
