  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Problems of degradation of modern higher education</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The article focuses on the value of the bachelor‚Äôs and master‚Äôs degrees, the goals of modern students, as well as the dilemmas faced by teachers in average institutions of higher education today. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  The gray mass of students-survivors </h4><br>  There is such a situation that, due to the fact that funding for a university directly depends on the number of students, students are <u>not expelled</u> , the dean's office is frightened with loud statements and threats from year to year, but in fact only the most lagging behind are expelled and, naturally, students Understand quickly, and the bulk begins to survive, and not learn.  They go to lectures to play smartphones and read books just for the ‚Äúwas‚Äù mark.  Again, it has a special effect that teachers need to introduce a point system so that a student with any knowledge can earn his poor three at least somehow.  The situation for those who really want to get an education starts to deteriorate and the temptation to ‚Äúscore‚Äù increases. <br><br>  So, in the audience at the lecture sits 3 groups, about 60-70 people.  The teacher understands that, for good, half of them must be dismissed, and then, the program can be safely given in full, without fear that almost everyone will not ‚Äúpull‚Äù, and it will be easier to teach when it is seen that people are drawn to knowledge and they do not care.  In fact, on the contrary, it is necessary to tune the program to the main mass, and to think of ways to reach everyone, which is why many teachers fall into anguish and lose interest in teaching.  Naturally in such a situation, the quality of teaching falls. <br><br><h4>  Undergraduate = PTU? </h4><br>  As I see it, the undergraduate system should work like this: if a person receives a bachelor's degree, it is assumed that he became an engineer who is able to solve engineering problems, and if he wants to solve research problems, he goes to magistracy.  In fact, due to the degradation of the general level of education (the average level of students), the bachelor graduated to the level of vocational school.  And, many who consider the knowledge gained as insufficient for further work, it remains only to go to the master's program.

    <h4>  Graduate - Pros and Cons </h4><br>  From my point of view, the magistracy is great.  Since those very survivors are eliminated there (they received their diplomas and happily left for their ‚Äúhappy‚Äù future), who have ruined the lives of students and teachers for 4 years, and here both teachers and students can work for 100% of their lives. forces and skills, in consequence of which the quality of education is increased by orders of magnitude. <br>  The disadvantages of graduate studies can be attributed, perhaps, to the extra 2 years of study, because at the end of the 4th year, the student is 21-22 years old, and at this time many no longer want to learn, but want to <s>get married to</s> work full-time work and, perhaps, build a family .  Often, there is nothing bad in it, there are people who come after the bachelor‚Äôs program just as worthy engineers and successfully build their careers with the knowledge gained. <br><br>  However, whether it all comes to the fact that a person will spend half his life on study, and there is not much time left for immediate actions. <br><br>  Separately, I want to note that all of the above is more typical for engineering departments of secondary universities (in universities like MIPT, for sure, everything is completely wrong) for the same programmers, it seems to me, everything is different, so experience is very important there . However, about it and so much was written on Habr√©. <br><br><h4>  Results </h4><br>  If you are a first-year student, try to think about what you need from the university. <br><br>  If you need only a diploma and a military ID from the department, then, for God's sake, since you most likely will not be expelled, respect your teachers and fellow students.  Remember that not everyone has the same goals.  But keep in mind that when applying for a job your diploma will not help you if you don‚Äôt know basic things, and they taught you to you, so it‚Äôs better to rethink why you are here, and remember that if you want, you can always start learning . <br><br>  If you know that you want to study the chosen specialty, then personally I advise you to go to the magistracy, because if you have a decent department, then during these 2 years you will receive a large stock of important knowledge, not only in the specialty, but also the knowledge that will help manage the <s>world</s> department or company in the future.  Also, you can consider the option of admission to the master's program at another university, maybe even in another city. <br><br>  If you are a teacher, I can only wish patience and more successful students.  Special thanks to those who do not give up, but try to drive knowledge to all of their students, since I was also a survivor once, but then I finally came to my senses, and successfully switched to the side of good, which I don‚Äôt regret. <br><br>  And finally, the advice to all applicants and their parents, do not be lazy to conduct a detailed study of the departments (namely, not faculties) that you are going to enter, the more options you consider, the more likely you will guess the future profession and work in the future will be fun, but not torment. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/200334/">https://habr.com/ru/post/200334/</a></p>
