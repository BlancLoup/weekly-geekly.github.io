I don‚Äôt think that someone from the local audience genuinely adheres to such a conviction, but I‚Äôm sure everyone will have an acquaintance who believes it is patriotic to question any reports about NASA‚Äôs success.  Here, in order to reassure such opponents, I prepared this material. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage3/b33/b5b/e55/b33b5be5535250475d3ddd7404a80538.jpg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Reports of falsifying the landing of Curiosity on Mars appeared almost immediately after this triumphant event.  Now such statements have faded away, but at first such things did not disdain to declare on television. <br><br><iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/37_-bJfizMM%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700021,15700043,15700186,15700190,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhhwj6Uc-ziPhdEevobIo03tsMsf8A" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

      If you do not consider the idea of ‚Äã‚Äã"like the Mojave," then the first replicas in favor of Arizona appeared on the third day of the mission, when Curiosity received the first color panorama.  On one of the mountain slopes in the distance you can see serpentine, in which some immediately recognized the country road. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage3/5c0/dd0/7e0/5c0dd07e0568605f16232067d57a7452.jpg"><br><br>  Of course, such things as the distance to this ‚Äúroad‚Äù they did not take into account.  They were not embarrassed by the fact that at such a distance the width of the road should be several hundred meters.  Also, I was not embarrassed by the fact that such an oversight on the part of the global organization of the conspirators looks like an indicator of the extreme lack of professionalism of these conspirators. <br><br>  In fact, this serpentine is not an optical illusion, and it really exists - it is the river bed that arose when the water flow broke from the outside into the Gale crater. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage3/3ec/f77/f8a/3ecf77f8a38e8186f1f7a41febe2a112.jpg"><br><br>  Just look at the satellite image to see this.  The white point indicates the location of the rover at the time of landing, blue - the current position. <br><br>  In general, the best way to make sure that Curiosity is exactly where its creators report is to compare the landscapes it sees from the surface and satellite imagery data. <br><br>  Periodically, I make such comparisons on a large scale: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage3/0d5/fdb/6c3/0d5fdb6c36c29fef390be0a92500b94f.jpg"><br><br>  And at close distances: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage3/af9/e89/422/af9e89422cdda46833d781339c98373b.jpg"><br><br>  As long as everything converges.  If someone doubts, then the whole of Google Earth is at his disposal and he can search for the corresponding landscapes in the American deserts. <br><br>  True, one flaw on the NASA JPL website was nevertheless revealed by vigilant conspiracy therapists.  Is there a <a href="http://mars.jpl.nasa.gov/explore/galecrater/">3D map of Gale's crater</a> , and there are signs of Ctrl + C Ctrl + V in it: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage3/db6/01a/c08/db601ac084db0e833d656c659e105f5a.jpg"><br><br>  In anticipation of the imminent fall of NASA‚Äôs tyranny on Youtube, a wave of exposing videos has passed.  But it quickly faded away, as most didn‚Äôt care, and those who were interested in the question simply checked the satellite images.  There were no signs of falsification: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage3/8f7/d4b/0ce/8f7d4b0ce99b087c7ea33e6e2f6770cf.jpg"><br><br>  Apparently, the NASA contractors, who made the application for the site, could not completely stretch a photograph of the surface onto the relief, and the gaps had to be smeared. <br><br>  The next reason for activating the conspirators was given by the rover when it made its own self-portrait. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage3/43c/409/13d/43c40913db2dacb490767ddfd50ca4f9.jpg"><br><br>  The question ‚ÄúHow did he take a picture of himself?‚Äù Is on the same level of tediousness next to the statement ‚Äú <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/160621/">Mars is not red</a> ‚Äù and jokes about oil and democracy. <br><br>  How many have explained, and NASA: <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/06Zf5Ug75-w%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700021,15700043,15700186,15700190,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhjSBEJ7PS-ENkxqZlEJ3A4uK9uAyQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  And enthusiasts <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/168551/">from Habr</a> : <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage3/20c/33a/5b3/20c33a5b33fa12bf24b117258762a1f5.jpg"><br><br>  But all the same, those who think that you cannot take a photo of yourself are saved, even if you have a hand with two elbows that can rotate 360 ‚Äã‚Äãdegrees. <br><br>  In the first portrait there is another detail that attracts the attention of those who want to look everywhere for revelations: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage3/cd3/904/276/cd39042768f7596c44d99313b5e28e6a.jpg"><br><br>  What it is?  Did the photographer‚Äôs traces, which the conspirators forgot to sweep before the shooting, didn‚Äôt notice during the shooting, were ignored during the pasting of the panorama and laid out in open access? <br><br>  Of course this is not a trace.  More precisely traces, but not the legs, and the bucket of the rover, which he used to collect soil for <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/156771/">research</a> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage3/337/40c/eda/33740ceda6bd78da0c1b4d8972227dca.jpg"><br><br>  Okay.  Having dealt with the "suspicious" photos, we will think: how else could you check that Curiosity is on Mars. <br><br>  You can look at the sky.  There is no moon, but Phobos and Deimos are moving: <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/7abQLDeD0xM%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700021,15700043,15700186,15700190,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhji0HCEd25brpah1im0YpwiPK0gxg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  Solar eclipses can be observed almost every year from the same point: <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/eQMcppy7PdM%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700021,15700043,15700186,15700190,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhjQy-hlSK9Y97Tip-wV6LXg3OBLgA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  And, as we can see, it is not the Moon that passes before the sun. <br><br>  You can complicate the task.  Let's look at this animation of Deimos transit through the Sun. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage3/0eb/0a6/bf9/0eb0a6bf95c0865426a2d6ff9d980fd2.gif"><br><br>  This picture is also interesting because we can see not only the satellite, but also sunspots. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage3/d3a/d09/f7f/d3ad09f7fa2663fb34a360a9b5fd583f.jpg"><br><br>  This animation was received exactly a year ago on September 18th.  If you look at the appearance of the Sun, which was visible from Earth on this day, the picture did not match.  At the time of the shooting, Mars was located about 100 degrees in the course of the rotation of the Sun from the Earth.  The speed of the axial rotation of the Sun is 14.5 degrees per day, so we can only see how the sunspots observed by Curiosity gradually come up on the side visible from Earth. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage3/a26/9ce/e9f/a269cee9ff67f543ec1833421acdf417.gif"><br><br>  Because of the location of the rover on the surface of Mars, and the inclination of the axis of rotation of the planet, we see sunspots not at the angle that the SDO satellite observes, therefore, to determine the conformity of the spots, the Curiosity image must be rotated. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage3/fc3/e94/2a7/fc3e942a7e46de779b3b458802aecd8b.jpg"><br><br>  If you think about why to falsify a flight to Mars at all, when it can be carried out in reality, then money will be called as the motivation of the conspirators.  Domestic conspiracy therapists, brought up on the covenants of the rollback and the cut, believe that the rover did not fly anywhere, and the nasovtsy ‚Äúdrank‚Äù $ 2.5 billion.  And now they are misleading the whole world: they take the rover around the nearest desert and draw photos in a 3D editor. <br><br>  This whole imaginary picture crumbles if you recall one simple fact - the Curiosity is not an American rover.  More precisely, he is American, but not only Americans work with him.  Who else?  Well, for example, Russian. <br><br><iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/f1CLTtdAR8s%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700021,15700043,15700186,15700190,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhiwz2gUoIwHiqX-f-mO8BJbEXzz7Q" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  <a href="http://l503.iki.rssi.ru/DAN.html">DAN device</a> : Space Research Institute of RAS, Space Gamma Spectroscopy Laboratory. <br><br>  And Canadians. <br>  <a href="http://www.asc-csa.gc.ca/eng/astronomy/mars/apxs.asp">APXS Spectrometer</a> : Canadian Space Agency, University of New Brunswick and University of Western Ontario. <br><br>  Spaniards. <br>  <a href="http://cab.inta-csic.es/rems/en/team/institutions-and-organizations/">REMS climate station</a> : Center for Astrobiology, National Institute of Aerospace Technology, National Research Council, Center for Industrial and Technological Development, Ministry of Defense of Spain, Ministry of Economics and Competitiveness, University of Catalonia. <br><br>  French people. <br>  <a href="http://www.msl-chemcam.com/index.php%3Fmenu%3Dinstitutions%26rubrique%3D61%26contact_page%3Dinstitutions%26titre_url%3DTeam%2520-%2520Institutions">Spectrometer ChemCam</a> : Research Institute of Astrophysics and Planetology, National Center for Space Research of France. <br><br>  Signals are transmitted from Mars not only to NASA's Far East space communications station in Goldstone, USA, but also to receiving stations in <a href="http://www.mdscc.org/">Spain</a> and <a href="http://www.cdscc.nasa.gov/">Australia</a> . <br>  The Finnish Meteorological Institute and the Australian National University are also involved in scientific activities. <br><br>  If everyone is paying extra for silence, then no billions will be enough.  One could even suspect something if the Americans did not allow anyone to work with the rover, and were in no hurry to share the materials it receives.  Meanwhile, NASA even offered to join the Martian mission.  It happened, for example, with the Russian device DAN.  Our devices, operating on a similar physical principle, are and bring valuable scientific information on one Mars and one lunar NASA orbiter.  Therefore, the Americans suggested that our scientists participate in a land project on a neighboring planet. <br><br>  But that's not all.  In the Martian orbit, not only NASA vehicles fly, but also ESA.  The automatic interplanetary station Mars Express was assembled by Europe and launched by Russia more than 10 years ago.  Since then, she has been successfully <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/183294/">working</a> in the orbit of the Red Planet: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/26a/e5a/4be/26ae5a4be2591982b1047c2a15035453.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  When Curiosity sat down, Mars Express helped in data transfer.  And once he had the opportunity to send several photos received by the rover.  The rover itself, with the help of American orbiters, has already transferred more than 80 thousand images.  But the ESA, having transferred several files, proudly wrote a <a href="http://spaceinimages.esa.int/Images/2012/11/Rocknest_32">press release</a> on how it helps the curious Martian wanderer. <br><br>  Speaking of 3D.  There is such an enthusiast of Mars artist Nick Sotiriadis who created the complete photorealistic <a href="http://www.nicksotiriadis.gr/mars-rover-project/">model Opportunity</a> .  How hard and time-consuming the process is, and how it is not easy to make "fake" Martian photos can be understood from his description of his work: <br><br>  " <i>After 5 years in the making of a cup of coffee, the project is about to be finished</i> ." <br><br>  And in the thread on the Planetary Community forum, on more than 30 pages, the <a href="http://www.unmannedspaceflight.com/index.php%3Fshowtopic%3D3143">discussion</a> going on from 2006 to 2012, you can see how the time-consuming process of creating one single photo took place: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b1e/842/47c/b1e84247cca6a2eadde26d23f066d8a3.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  In sum, all factors allow you to be sure that Curiosity is exactly where it should be.  His work continues, Mars reveals its secrets, and gives rise to new mysteries. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/cb0/9c4/cd0/cb09c4cd0552ea8d2919b62391a2ccf7.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <a href="https://vk.com/wall-41633702_38244">On the desktop</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/194254/">https://habr.com/ru/post/194254/</a></p>
