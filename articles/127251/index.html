How it was</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Hi habrup! <br><br>  This weekend, i.e.  August 27-28, <a href="http://rudeveloper.blogspot.com/2011/08/chrome-gtug-google.html">Chrome Hackathon was held in Russia and the CIS</a> .  Upon learning of this, I began to look for where in my city (Novosibirsk) this event will take place.  And what was my surprise when I learned that we do not have a local GTUG group, and I have to go.  After reading all the references, I chose the city of Omsk: it was where it would stop, and rather close to Novosibirsk. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>

      The first day.  On this day, <a href="http://mikewest.org/">Mike West</a> was scheduled to perform (presentation of the presentation: <a href="http://mkw.st/20110827/">mkw.st/20110827</a> ). <br><img src="http://static.mikewest.org/20100307/mikewest.jpg" alt="image"><br>  The presentation was written using html 5 and looked very impressive.  Mike talked about the basic principles of work and the development of add-ons.  The only thing that, in my opinion, was missing after Mike‚Äôs speech was that the local expert in each city showed how to start developing add-ons.  Still, not everyone has English - this is their native language.  The rest of the day was spent exploring user requests and developing an add-on framework.  I chose a difficult addition: an imglikeopera analogue for chrome. <br>  Photos from day one: <br>  Coding session in St. Petersburg (It seems that Mike also has an addition, and he will win :)): <br> <a href="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-haP-QHLyR7M/TlkYhpAmrqI/AAAAAAAAA70/zKY2y8h1dsE/s640/11%252B-%252B1"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/0bf/f77/bc3/0bff77bc305eade52cb9504006be631c.jpg" alt="image"></a> <br>  Alexey (the organizer of Omsk GTUG) spoke about what awaits us in these 2 days: <br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/e21/9bd/fd8/e219bdfd804074894216b51b0bf2bd78.jpg" alt="image"></a> <br>  To the video broadcast ready: <br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/e2e/28d/339/e2e28d339fa7f82ed0dbb9d4addb86b0.jpg" alt="image"></a> <br>  Participants are preparing to actively code, and some seem to have already done half: <br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/b26/58d/03a/b2658d03aea5d6ecf89670747f121424.jpg" alt="image"></a> <br>  Participants received icons with a browser emblem: <br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/c03/227/244/c03227244d7d756f06677e3337e4496b.jpg" alt="image"></a> <br><br>  As soon as my addition will be ready, I will draw up an article about it.  But it will be ready only after google translates the API I need into stable.  So far, if someone wants to help me in testing, leave your emails in a personal, and as soon as there is something to test, I'll write to you. <br><br>  According to statistics, 30 people arrived on the first day in Omsk.  This is the second result for all cities.  I think here we need to thank the organizers separately. <br><br>  Second day.  On this day, 2 reports were planned: Mike West (the report described how to debug his writings, and, as far as I remember, the experimental functions of adding his functionality to devtools were shown, Alexei Shelestenko (the report was about the Web Store, how to make money on their applications).  At the end of the second day there was a demo fest at which all participants told what they managed to do, how they managed to do it and what will be done in the future.  Unfortunately, the train was leaving before the event ended, so I had to leave the city of Omsk. <br>  Photo of the second day: <br>  Mike tells the report: <br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/53c/b01/d50/53cb01d503664ac58a85b32b719ab229.jpg" alt="image"></a> <br>  Google Hangout in action (screen capture from Mike‚Äôs monitor to show examples): <br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/a96/d84/8e8/a96d848e80ef51a2286ae6c11de353d9.jpg" alt="image"></a> <br>  I was highlighted when I talked about something: <br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/d52/5ff/29a/d525ff29a1e97f5db14b66670bf42351.jpg" alt="image"></a> <br>  Rest between coding sessions: <br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/246/861/c8e/246861c8e8d9344a1ffe020e30fe53d0.jpg" alt="image"></a> <br>  Someone managed to take the "bread" place: <br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/0c2/a3d/88e/0c2a3d88e49bb4cce9b20cfd989cc0b5.jpg" alt="image"></a> <br><br>  The best addition in Omsk was the addition of Pixel Perfect (as soon as the guys put it in the public domain, add a link) <br><br>  It is worth noting that the video broadcast was organized perfectly, the only thing that was bad, the participants asking questions were hardly heard.  I think this moment will be taken into account by the organizers in the future. <br><br>  Lunches in the form of pizza and juice were organized on both days.  Cookies and tea were available throughout.  I did not have to starve :) <br><br>  I would like to thank <a href="http://omsk.gtugs.org/">Omsk and the organizers</a> : Alexey Korovyansky, Jacob Lilo and Egor Nepomnyashchikh, a tremendous human thanks to you.
