However, by and large, if we leave aside jokes such as <a href="https://lurkmore.to/%25D0%259A%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BF%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BF%25D0%25B0%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D0%25B0:%25D0%2592%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BD%25D1%258B%25D0%25B9_%25D0%25BA%25D1%2583%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580">overclocking the monitor diagonal</a> , there are not so many devices in the computer to which an inquiring overclocker's mind can be attached.  In September last year, Intel stirred up the interested public by announcing plans to add SSDs to the list of devices ready for overclocking and even demonstrated how it would look. <br>  However, everything turned out a little differently as a result, and now we are pleased to present the new Intel 730 series - the first SSDs that were maximally overclocked by the factory method. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Why did Intel remain unfulfilled plans for the release of SSD with a user interface for overclocking?  After all, the first samples were to appear on the shelves at the beginning of this year.  According to a company representative, the problem is that Intel cannot provide a full 5-year warranty for the product, the performance and reliability characteristics of which can be changed by the user.  Well, to limit in any way a guarantee is, as they say, not our method.  We had to find another one - and it was found.  So there was a 730 series - SSD, overclocked already at the factory. <br><br>  Surely, it is not a secret to anyone that the SSD controller, like all other controllers, is not operating at full capacity in its normal mode and has a frequency margin, first of all, to ensure reliability.  However, the more advanced the production technologies of chips become, the smaller stock remains really necessary - in principle, it can be reduced to zero, as the Intel 730 series demonstrates. Compared to the 530 series, the controller frequency is increased by 50% (from 400 to 600 MHz), and the speed of the NAND memory bus - by 20% (from 83 to 100 MHz).  These are the maximum parameters that can be squeezed out of this system, while extending the standard Intel warranty to it. <br><br>  The speed of the new drive will be 550 MB / s with sequential reading and 450 MB / s with sequential writing, which is not much different from the characteristics of SSD 530 series, however, it is noted that the new product has a more uniform performance and lower latency.  Thus, the read latency is about 50 ¬µs with a performance of 89,000 IOPs (random read).  Intel especially recommends using new SSDs to create high-performance RAID arrays - the speed increase can be seen in the diagram below.

Extreme gamers trying to get the most out of their PC.  Specialists in design and video editing, working with high and ultra high definition content.  Well, and other perfectionists and lovers of skulls on the body of the device.  By the way, both the 730 series controller and 10-channel NAND memory were previously used by Intel only in professional SSDs for data centers <br><br>  As part of the 730 series will be released drives with a capacity of 240 and 480 GB.  Their exact cost has not yet been announced, but it is known that the price of a gigabyte will be a little less than $ 1.  The start of sales is scheduled already this month. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/214705/">https://habr.com/ru/post/214705/</a></p>
