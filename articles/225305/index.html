And how often do they send you tickets to solve a problem in the application, although in fact the problem is in the incompatibility of versions of different applications?  And how long do you have to wait for the virtual machine when there are not enough local machine resources to launch the new version of the application?  For us, these issues were quite sick, and we broke thousands of copies in disputes, trying to solve them.  Practice shows that Vagrant can become one of the options for solving these problems. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Vagrant is something like a wrapper over a virtualization system or, if you like, DSL.  VirtualBox is most often used, but there are drivers for VmWare and even for Amazon EC2.  More information, as well as how to install it and get started, can be found on the official website - <a href="http://www.vagrantup.com/">www.vagrantup.com</a> <br><br><h4>  Vagrant and environment testing </h4><br>  We have several proprietary applications that communicate with each other via the RabbitMQ bus and use things like MongoDB and MySQL.  Testing of individual applications launched in a synthetic environment that is far from the real environment did not show us the behavior of a bundle of applications in a real environment when updating a single element.  And the changes in the environment did not show anything at all, because the QA and staging environments were far from real.  Of course, this does not save us from the need to conduct unit testing.

      <br>
      Let's try to solve this problem with the help of Vagrant. <br><br>  For clarity, I will show this scheme: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d5c/a16/7ce/d5ca167ce99068a49ebe29cfec43c516.png"><br><br>  Description of flow: <br><ul><li>  The developer makes any changes to the environment in the repository and sends the code for review to other developers; </li><li>  TeamCity picks up the changes, runs the unit tests; </li><li>  TeamCity runs Vagrant on BuildAgent, which initiates the launch of several virtual machines and the launch of the Puppet agent; </li><li>  The modified environment and stable versions of the tested applications rolls onto virtual machines; </li><li>  Tests run, or QA checks the operation of the application; </li></ul><br>  This can help check before sending changes to the Product environment: new versions of third-party applications work, Puppet manifests, custom scripts, loss of application connectivity, service crashes, business process emulation, and so on.  And we will definitely not get the situation in the style of ‚Äúaaa, we forgot to put the package on the server‚Äù or ‚Äúpancake, the API was changed, and now the applications with each other do not work‚Äù.  Well, you should pay attention that in this scheme Puppet Master is used instead of Puppet Standalone, just to repeat the real environment. <br><br>  In our case, the complication of the problem is that Amazon EC2, Openstack or even VmWare ESXi can be used, which again does not help to catch the bugs and situations associated with them.  The only way out in this situation, I see the use of all this bundle, but with a provider other than VirtualBox.  And from this there is a small drawback - forcing Vagrant to work with other providers is not always a trivial task.  Well and still, there is not always a machine for the building agent that will pull on itself N virtual locks with applications that need a lot of resources for work. <br><br>  And the beauty lies in the fact that we have a project in the repository, which has a history of changes, which pass the review and all changes, including the installation of the VIM, are tested before getting into production.  Well, no one bothers us in the same way to check and external resources, update the database, bus and all frontends on node.js.  It all depends on the imagination and desire. <br><br>  Further in the article will be described how to use Vagrant to implement the above scheme. <br><br><h4>  Starting a simple service </h4><br>  Normal usecase for Vagrant: raise the service and the environment and see how my code works in this environment.  Especially if you want to see some kind of platform-dependent thing.  Well, plus, Vagrant allows not to plant a zoo on a working machine, not to hold simultaneously packs of software and services of different versions for different needs and projects. <br><br>  One of the most pleasant features for me is Puppet support, both in master and in standalone modes.  Of course, Vagrant is able and Chef, but we in our company use Puppet, therefore for me the choice is obvious.  I will use Puppet Standalone, or simply puppet apply. <br><br>  First of all, go to the project directory and do a vagrant init, as a result we get the Vagrantfile file, which contains the description of our virtual locks.  I prefer to use the once configured file and copy it from the project to the project, changing the necessary sections and configs.  In the file below Vagrantfile one VM.  For example, configure RabbitMQ and install Oracle Java. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Vagrantfile:</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><pre><code class="ruby hljs"><span class="hljs-comment"><span class="hljs-comment"># -*- mode: ruby -*- # vi: set ft=ruby : # Vagrantfile API/syntax version.

But I‚Äôm a lazy person, and I don‚Äôt want to install and configure software on a virtual machine every time, but I don‚Äôt want to waste time and immediately start chasing the code or doing any tests. <br><br>  Add a section to the Vagrantfile description: <br><br><pre> <code class="ruby hljs">rmq.vm.provision <span class="hljs-symbol"><span class="hljs-symbol">:puppet</span></span> <span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">do</span></span> <span class="hljs-params"><span class="hljs-params">|puppet|</span></span> puppet.manifests_path = <span class="hljs-string"><span class="hljs-string">"./vagrant.d/manifests"</span></span> puppet.manifest_file = <span class="hljs-string"><span class="hljs-string">"site-rmq.pp"</span></span> puppet.module_path = <span class="hljs-string"><span class="hljs-string">"./vagrant.d/modules"</span></span> puppet.options = <span class="hljs-string"><span class="hljs-string">"--fileserver=/vagrant/vagrant.d/fileserver.conf --verbose --debug"</span></span> <span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">end</span></span></code> </pre><br><br>  And, accordingly, we need to create ./vagrant.d/modules, ./vagrant.d/manifests, ./vagrant.d/files and ./vagrant.d/manifests/site-rmq.pp "and ./vagrant.d/fileserver.conf. <br><br>  The modules directory contains module files that we will use;  The manifests directory contains the manifest of site-rmq.pp Puppet of our virtual machine;  files - directory with files that are controlled by fileserver;  fileserver.conf is a file for using fileserver and putting some specific files into our virtual machine. <br><br>  But if we want to use third-party modules for Puppet, then they need to be installed before running puppet apply.  For this, I did not invent anything better than to use the script;  if there are craftsmen who will tell me how to put the modules, and then use them in manifests with just one Puppet, I will be grateful.  =) <br><br>  Add a section for virtualka provisioning with a shell script: <br><br><pre> <code class="ruby hljs"><span class="hljs-comment"><span class="hljs-comment"># Enable shell provisioning config.vm.provision "shell", path: "./vagrant.d/pre-puppet.sh"</span></span></code> </pre><br><br>  And create a script in the directory ./vagrant.d: <br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">pre-puppet.sh:</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><pre> <code class="bash hljs"><span class="hljs-comment"><span class="hljs-comment">#!/bin/bash # This script installs modules for puppet standalone echo "[Info] Running pre-puppet.sh for install modules" if [ "x$(dpkg -l | grep -E '^ii\s+git\s')" == "x" ] then echo "[Info] Installing git" apt-get -y install git || (echo "[Error] Cant install git" &amp;&amp; exit 0) else echo "[Info] git already is installed, skipping" fi if [ "x$(gem list librarian-puppet|grep -v LOCAL)" == "x" ] then echo "[Info] Installing librarian-puppet" gem install librarian-puppet || (echo "[Error] Cant install librarian-puppet" &amp;&amp; exit 0) else echo "[Info] librarian-puppet already is installed, skipping" fi if [ ! -e Puppetfile ] then cat &gt; Puppetfile &lt;&lt; EOF #!/usr/bin/env ruby #^syntax detection # Warning! # Do not edit this file, check pre-puppet.sh script! # forge "http://forge.puppetlabs.com" # use dependencies defined in Modulefile #modulefile mod 'puppetlabs/rabbitmq' mod 'saz/timezone' mod 'saz/locales' mod 'jpuppet/java-git', :git =&gt; "git://github.com/jpuppet/java.git" mod 'jfryman/nginx' EOF fi mkdir -p /vagrant/vagrant.d/modules echo "[Info] Installing puppet modules" librarian-puppet install --path=/vagrant/vagrant.d/modules/ || (echo "[Error] Cant install modules" &amp;&amp; exit) rm Puppetfile* # Ugly hack for java cp -r /vagrant/vagrant.d/modules/java-git/modules/java /vagrant/vagrant.d/modules exit 0</span></span></code> </pre><br></div></div><br>  In the script from the repository, git and librarian-puppet are installed and then the modules we need are installed using librarian-puppet.
