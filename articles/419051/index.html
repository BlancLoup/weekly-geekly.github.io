I will share our experience in this area in the new material. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/wl/fn/9l/wlfn9lyudm4opj6bbcnsx41iqws.jpeg"></div><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  Getting to work and the first ~ three months </h2><br>  If everything has grown together - the employee goes to work.  We give him corporate equipment - DevOps-engineers, for example, a working laptop and a headset tested for quality and compatibility with the desired hardware.  All this is sent home using the delivery service. <br><br>  The necessary software is installed on the laptop (including integration with internal services) and mandatory security measures (for example, data encryption) are provided.  All engineers have Ubuntu.  Sources of integration with our services are open to employees.

      We generally love <b>open source software</b> : the source code of all internal projects is available to any engineer.  And on any of them you can see, for example, the following: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/8w/ly/qd/8wlyqd5fm-w5vf558358sl8b00q.png"><br><br>  By clicking on the commit number, you go to it in the internal GitLab.  Do not like something?  Want to fix it?  Read the code, edit, send the merge request - we are engineers in the end! <br><br>  <i><b>Note</b> : Our love for Open Source, however, extends even further.</i>  <i>We opened a number of our developments to the community on <a href="http://github.com/flant">GitHub</a> , and before using it, approximately since 2009, we did it with the help of other resources.</i>  <i>And we <a href="https://habr.com/company/flant/blog/333682/">continue</a> to <a href="https://habr.com/company/flant/blog/341386/">open as</a> much as possible (hint: we have another project on the way, the sources of which are already publicly available ... follow the announcements on our blog!).</i>  <i>In addition, we <a href="https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/merge_requests/6201">invest</a> in projects close to us (like <a href="https://github.com/helm/helm/pull/3540">Helm</a> and <a href="https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/merge_requests/6201">GitLab</a> ) and <a href="https://github.com/flant/flunch">sometimes indulge</a> .</i> <br><br><h3>  Flexible methodologies like code </h3><br>  ‚ÄúFlant‚Äù works according to flexible methodologies, but instead of holivars about the correctness of the wording in the Agile-manifest, we implement methodologies in code.  Internal services for tracking tasks, time, projects and other things are <b>well integrated with each other</b> and deprive us of a huge amount of headaches.  How? <br><br>  For example, we have our own system of accounting "cards" and time per day, made using two web services: Nixon and Ford (by the names of American presidents). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/dq/ri/3o/dqri3oflgikfgkjbzom8n4iw_yo.png" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/wt/jd/ix/wtjdix8ic8quoox77roqg8fbtfw.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Why not Trello?  Because our Nixon and Ford, among other things, are able to: <br><br><ul><li>  understand that a person can solve problems in different teams during the day (and he needs to do it comfortably!); </li><li>  with a single click, create tasks from a card in Redmine, as well as integrate with GitLab and GitHub; </li><li>  divide cards by priorities, postpone them for a date or backlog; </li><li>  organize simple workflow with confirmation; </li><li>  filter, search and provide a lot of relevant hotkey. </li></ul><br>  Simply put - these services are maximally optimized for our specific requests, which change over time, as well as complemented by extensive feedback from direct users (engineers). <br><br>  To handle incidents, the engineers on duty have Polk (yes, there was such a <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259F%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BB%25D0%25BA,_%25D0%2594%25D0%25B6%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B9%25D0%25BC%25D1%2581_%25D0%259D%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BA%25D1%2581">president</a> ) - he, too, is integrated with all that is possible.  Quick task creation (if the incident is not urgent and requires a lot of work), collecting incoming alerts from several types of monitoring, direct communication with clients via Slackbot and many other necessary functions ... We don‚Äôt imagine effective work otherwise. <br><br>  Or, for example, project management.  There is a Bush service that remembers everything about clients, their projects, employees and teams.  Are you creating a project in the internal GitLab?  Just beat the necessary information in Bush - he will create all the settings, provide all access and create a repository. <br><br><h3>  Adaptation </h3><br>  First of all, the newcomer takes the course of a young fighter in a specialized team engaged in the dissemination of knowledge.  We teach him the necessary minimum, with which he can immediately go into his team, having an understanding of what is happening and understand the specifics of client projects.  This takes the first 3-4 days, after which the engineer, under the sensitive attention of the team leader and engineers of the knowledge dissemination team, begins to sink into real combat missions. <br><br>  In order for the newcomer to orient himself safely in the stream of new knowledge, we formulate for him a <b>list of achievements</b> - ‚Äúachivok‚Äù.  The first time is very scary and cool at the same time, and we put a lot of effort to ‚Äúcool‚Äù to prevail. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/9e/rq/6r/9erq6rkczvd0rgvj9uyxoecraki.jpeg"><br><br>  Later, when the engineer passes the probationary period (by default it is 3 months, but sometimes less depending on various criteria - see note below), the list of achievements per quarter will be formed individually, but at first we seize the initiative and give it <b>key points</b> like: <br><br><ul><li>  A do-it-yourself Kubernetes cluster.  Possible occasional help from colleagues.  Maximum - 2 working days. </li><li>  Fully self-deployed Ceph in Kubernetes. </li><li>  Accepted MR or created Issue in any documentation project. </li><li>  Closed day, filled with correctly issued cards with correct timers. </li><li>  ... </li></ul><br>  <i><b>Note</b> : By the way, one of the additional incentives for completing a trial period (during its length, employees receive a fix) are the very bonuses that come in our payment system immediately after it.</i> <br><br>  Key tasks we gradually wrap up in internal courses and guides in the knowledge base. <br><br>  Such achievements help the team to choose the right performer for the tasks.  There is always a temptation to throw tasks on those who will deal with them quickly, ignoring those who need to improve skills.  We are successfully fighting this. <br><br>  The key point to which the novice is keen to come is to go on duty in his team.  Each engineer on the team spends one of his working days in turn on duty on the team‚Äôs projects: promptly answering customer questions and responding to accidents.  Of course, he does not remain alone: ‚Äã‚Äãthe simplest questions close the first and second lines of support, the more complex ones go to more experienced teams.  And the team itself is always in the wings, the duty officer, if necessary, can call the right engineers for help. <br><br>  This helps all team members to keep abreast of all projects, and also gives them a real picture of the problems that can be eliminated in the bud, and because of this start to get more money. <br><br><h2>  Salary and bonuses </h2><br>  We strive to achieve results with the help of our brains, and not monstrous investments of effort and time.  Therefore, the more projects a team takes without loss of efficiency, the more money the employees receive.  We have developed a rather clever and rare payment system, which is surprising to some.  I'll try to explain. <br><br>  We lived all our lives on the hourly basis, but rested on the fact that the people are gradually burning out and not solving problems systematically.  Over time, we switched to a new approach, which implies a sum of: a flat rate + some part depending on the hours spent, + bonuses for the effectiveness of the team.  The transition demanded courage from engineers, but as a result everyone was satisfied, they began to receive a large salary and it was better to get enough sleep. <br><br>  The team has received money that the team received in excess of the minimum required to cover salaries, based on agreements with its team.  Most often, the carcass of the extracted bear is divided on the basis of the hours spent and the level of wages. <br><br>  To understand the general level: the salary of our engineer in the regions is approximately from 90 to 150 thousand rubles per month (on hand).  Of course, this is ‚Äúthe average temperature in a hospital,‚Äù because it is always an area of ‚Äã‚Äãpersonal agreement and a combination of many different factors. <br><br>  All the employees of our company work from the first day ‚Äúin white‚Äù, officially, under an indefinite labor contract and in accordance with the Labor Code of the Russian Federation.  A completely white salary (paid in two parts on fixed dates of the month) implies that taxes are paid on it and contributions made to all necessary funds.  As a result, the entire income of our employees is displayed in the 2NDFL certificates and there are no problems when applying for loans. <br><br>  In addition, "Flant", of course, pays the full amount of sick leave and leave.  By the way, we have two types of vacations: annual (28 calendar days) and additional, three more paid days per year.  Time off or days off without pay is also possible, but it is important to warn the team, coordinate the issue with the team leader and make sure that the absence of an employee does not lead to critical consequences.  Understanding that there are cases of urgent need, we try to find ways to release the employee in such situations, despite the legal restrictions (the Labor Code requires warning of their leave and time off in advance). <br><br><h2>  Growth in the company </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/jo/-v/dy/jo-vdy6hkhn4ohshl-fhcq6tkie.jpeg"><br><br>  Let this is not quite the topic of the article, I can not ignore the fact that growth in the company is not an empty marketing campaign for us.  We really strive to provide all opportunities for long-term relationships with employees and participate in their development (in accordance with predispositions and preferences).  Moreover, thanks to the existing scale of the company and the diversity of clients and related activities (including our internal processes), we really have something to offer. <br><br>  Of course, there is a ‚Äúdefault path‚Äù L1 ‚Üí L2 ‚Üí DevOps engineer (including performing L3 functions) ‚Üí lead engineer, team leader, PM ... But more complex moves happen, which depend not only on human abilities, but also on actual ones company needs.  So, for example, once we had the position of a ‚Äúdirector of service‚Äù, to which one of the on-duty (L1 / L2) engineers had grown, and it suffices to recall that we have special teams, such as R &amp; D. <br><br>  If readers have an interest (write in the comments!) - we will tell you about what stories of growth and development in the company really happened to our employees and appear now. <br><br><h2>  Instead of conclusion </h2><br>  Adaptation processes have become more relevant than ever as the company grows.  In our case, the turning point - the stage at which we felt that a qualitative shift in working with new engineers was critical for business - occurred in the area of ‚Äã‚Äã50 employees.  However, in many respects this is only the beginning of the path - our approach to adaptation is actively developing right now.  We build the processes of internal recruitment and exchange of experience, develop tools for everyday work and develop a knowledge base.  However, this is a completely different story ... <br><br><h2>  PS </h2><br>  I express my gratitude to my colleagues: HR-director Anna and <a href="https://habr.com/users/shurup/" class="user_link">shurup</a> - for their help in preparing both parts of this article.  We are happy to share our experience in other issues related to this ‚Äúinternal kitchen‚Äù of our company, according to your requests. <br><br><h2>  Pps </h2><br>  Read also in our blog: <br><br><ul><li>  ‚Äú <a href="https://habr.com/company/flant/blog/417725/">How Flant hires employees</a> ‚Äù; </li><li>  ‚Äú <a href="https://habr.com/company/flant/blog/342590/">7 habits of successful Site Reliability Engineers (according to New Relic)</a> ‚Äù. </li></ul></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/419051/">https://habr.com/ru/post/419051/</a></p>
