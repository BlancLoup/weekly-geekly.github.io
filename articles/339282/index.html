      2. We live in 2017 and having 4-8GB of RAM is considered a reasonable minimum for the user, if a person uses Nokia 3310, then it‚Äôs stupid to complain about the inoperability of Yandex maps. <br><br>  3. 90 - 95% of tasks in our market, these are primitive applications by type: <br><br><ul><li>  To get data </li><li>  Submit data </li><li>  Edit data </li><li>  Visualize the data. </li><li>  Count data </li></ul><br>  4. The ultimate goal of a business is money, remember that we write code not for ourselves, but for solving business problems. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  Why is C # developers no longer needed in 2018? </h2><br><ol><li>  Applications are not cross-platform, the employer needs to hire additional personnel in order to be able to compete at least somehow in the application market.  If you do not do this, your competitor will do it. </li><li>  You can not make a beautiful application that can be sold in 2018. </li><li>  The visual part of C # WPF suffers when you need to do something that goes beyond the set of standard components, something adaptive and interactive starts full horror with the deadlines in the month when the web developer solves this problem for a couple of days, if not hours, absolutely any design deadlines. </li></ol><br><h2>  What do I offer to managers? </h2><br>  I want to offer you to forget about old-fashioned NET Developers, I want to remind you that you are not Google and most likely you are solving simple tasks.  You don't need a genius for optimization, we live in 2017. <br><br>  It‚Äôs not the one who writes the code occupying 10 Mb of RAM that‚Äôs beneficial for you, the person who will bring more money to your business and write this code faster than the C # developer, you can sometimes donate 10% of RAM, but get + 20,000,000 in pocket. <br><br><h2>  Who will solve this problem? </h2><br>  This task will be solved by a JavaScript developer, maybe he doesn‚Äôt know how to write 200kb servers that fit on the microcontroller, but he can make money and make the product work quickly, beautifully, reliably and most importantly on <b>all platforms</b> . <br><br>  Already today, you can write applications in JavaScript and, at the output, receive iOS + Android + Unix + Window applications at no extra cost.  Of course, you will not be able to write 3D games, but you will be able to solve the problems of 95% of the market described above without problems. <br><br><h2>  Answer popular questions </h2><br>  Q: <b>JS is a curve, it is bad without wrappers</b> <br><br>  Answer: Curve, we make money, but we do not argue with someone as the variable is declared, this dispute will be endless, a ‚Äúwrapper‚Äù solves this problem, the setup takes 5 minutes, in a few years it will all be available from the box. <br><br>  Question: <b>You do not have architecture and you can not build large-scale projects</b> <br><br>  Answer: You can, how to do it - is known to the web developer. <br><br>  Question: <b>JS is slow, it is difficult to make any calculations on it.</b> <br><br>  Answer: Yes, but your business is not engaged in the development of a 3D editor?  Let me remind you that you need to earn money, and not to brag about how many lines of code your product takes.  Even if you have to solve complex problems, you can always connect the C ++ programmer‚Äôs module via WASM. <br><br>  Question: <b>I hired a JS specialist for 50,000 rubles, and he doesn‚Äôt know anything</b> <br><br>  Answer: It was not a specialist, it was Junior. <br><br>  Question: <b>JS will die in 5 years, followed by Node.js and Electron</b> <br><br>  Answer: in order to overthrow JS from the throne, you need to completely change the entire Internet, you need to rewrite Google, you need to create completely new protocols, you need to change all people and all technologies and only then you can create an alternative to JS.  WASM, for which everyone prays, will give a huge increase in JS in a couple of years and JS can be used in that 5% business share that JS Developer hasn‚Äôt gone before, for example web photoshop, but my post is not about these tasks. <br><br>  Question: <b>what about WASM, it will kill javascript</b> <br><br>  Answer: This is not a replacement for JS, it‚Äôs just an improvement, many people are bored that they cannot create products like Photoshop in the browser and created WASM, let me remind you that PHP can integrate C ++ libraries to solve critical tasks requiring high speed. in js. <br><br>  Let's imagine for a moment that C ++ C # will create a framework that will compete with React and Angular, just fantasizing. <br><br><ol><li>  And why only C ++ and C #, other languages ‚Äã‚Äãwill want to do this too, even PHP. </li><li>  What is bad React and Angular?  Speed?  Who forbids react and angular to rewrite critical parts of the code on wasm? </li><li>  Each language will have 2-4 frameworks, a community in them will be very weak, I think you understand what this will lead to and who will still occupy a leading position. </li><li>  Few people will want to understand the intricacies of the web, think with ++ programmers will run to create forms for sites? </li><li>  Nobody wants to learn JS and CSS, but you have to learn. </li><li>  ‚ÄúTo write websites in any language‚Äù is possible today, in many languages ‚Äã‚Äãyou can generate JS code using your favorite language, but for some reason nobody needs it and nobody uses it. </li></ol></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/339282/">https://habr.com/ru/post/339282/</a></p>
