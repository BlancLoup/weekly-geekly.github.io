More precisely - by and large everything is in order with it: we have business angels, accelerators, business incubators and venture capital funds of various sizes, and even investment banks - and all this works more or less well, but there are 2 important ones points that create problems in the model architecture. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  <b>The most difficult part is to pass the entry threshold</b> (up to a million dollars), where 90% of normal projects fall off.  The second in complexity is to do the sowing later (where very large marketing resources are needed).  Bureaucrats in this model have advantages, and large.  And as we know from the history of management (and not only), where there is such a model, the appearance of a flexible decentralized system, initially working with the ‚Äúlong tail‚Äù of projects, and then with basic things, is logical.

      Well, to the heap - in our country now such a situation, when everyone already understood that it is time to tear the ass off the chair and do the real things, and not to cut money.  People are willing to support good things.  This is only planned, but it is already clear that any thing that leads to a specific, even if simple, result is perceived well. <br><br><h4>  Kickstarter </h4><br>  The first sign was Kickstarter, which allowed him to literally turn his eyes on game-devs.  Just think: hardly any of the big publishers decided to re-release Fallout 2 - after all, for all its legendaryness, it showed disgusting sales results - but at the same time Wasteland 2 will live, and the project became successful even before the start. <br><br>  But Kikstarter can‚Äôt get away with something that requires more serious investments (like, ‚Äúlet's build a normal bank‚Äù or serious infrastructure like ‚Äúlet's release a new piece of metal and sell it everywhere‚Äù).  There are no major players who could provide this, you can not go there for the support of a large company.  Another problem is that projects are not insured against failure, that is, you never know if there will be something concrete, where you have given 10 bucks, successful.  But this is 10 bucks, right?  It burns - and to hell with it, you still have a lot of papers left. <br><br>  After analyzing this situation, at some point I decided to create a service that fully utilizes the new model of the economy, which is characteristic for, however pathetic it may sound, our new information society.  The beauty is that, thanks to my work in the stock and banking segment, I clearly understood the whole bureaucracy (and I was sick of its surplus) - and at the same time I knew that there are a lot of people with money (often large) who are just waiting for the opportunity to invest in something worthwhile, not just an air lock on paper. <br><br>  <b>So, the future ecosystem for the projects should have the following qualities:</b> <br><ul><li>  <b>Must be able to attract large investments</b> .  This is really important for many iron development projects, a business with a long-term payback period, research projects and other things that do not have goals like ‚Äúto raise money quickly and withdraw before nobody understood anything‚Äù. </li><li>  <b>There should be a system for evaluating projects prior to the start of investment</b> , that is, a certain threshold that eliminates inadequate, so that the system does not turn into a bunch of losers.  It is necessary to select only good projects that will help to make something important and necessary.  And the selection should be dealt with not by one person with a developed intuition, but by a number of experts who are ready to present rational and personal arguments.  By the way, this, in particular, means that the road will be opened to projects without special investment attractiveness, but interesting in terms of progress - only they will be marked that "money will not be soon." </li><li>  <b>Two types of investors are needed: large companies, attracted by the analogue of IPO</b> , as well as many micro-investors working on the crowd principle.  Even more specifically: if, for example, you make a piece of metal, then there will be one company that will receive a 20% stake (and build at its plant) and N people who will receive shares for a fraction of percent for their small deposits.  Attracting big investors opens the way to big finances, attracting a lot of people - it gives them very unchallenged bonuses to them personally - and immediately a quick start for the project.  My practice shows that 650 shareholders are able to talk about a project to 150 thousand people in a day, thanks to social networks.  This factor is one of the most important in the new model in general. </li></ul><br><br>  Such an ecosystem also has new risks: for example, if something does not take off from the first two or three projects, it will affect everything else because of the same social effect.  Therefore, the first selection will have to do some hard. <br><br>  We have already received funding from one venture fund, and in the first half of 2013 we are launching the Smartmarket.  While there are a lot of legal difficulties, but this is all solved.  I really want this to be a platform where those whose project because of courage, some kind of madness and fear of unusual new things could not be accepted by ‚Äúdinosaurs‚Äù can go - and where there will really be something that at least a little but will change the world. <br><br>  If you're interested, I can tell you in detail why it seems to me that microinvestment is generally the next generation of our country's economy, and how it can be used specifically for your crazy idea.  But it is a bit later. <br><br>  And now, please tell us what exactly can prevent you from getting investments for your project, or what prevents you from investing in someone else's projects. <br><br>  Please write at all any arguments ranging from ‚ÄúI do not trust all those who use foreign words in speech‚Äù or ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt understand where to go with the money so they don‚Äôt throw it‚Äù to ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt think that it was possible.‚Äù  Thank you in advance. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/164231/">https://habr.com/ru/post/164231/</a></p>
