No, not so, better ... <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  According to our observation, people are divided into two categories: some open an apartment to everyone who calls, others - to anyone, if not notified in advance by phone, mail, or something else.  The latter can sometimes surrender after half an hour of hooting in the corridor: you often have to see someone poke a certificate into the peephole, spell his reputation in the door chink.  Hospitality - frankly ... <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e7c/c9b/801/e7cc9b8013334d1cb036529508b4c1ac.jpg">

      Unfortunately, the latter do a little bit wiser, but only a little, because the professionals in their field know how to get you to open the door.  Only honest people will explain for a long time that they are not horses.  Therefore, it is better to open to strangers boldly - at least it will not be insulting for human dignity.  Or deep inside shaking in fears?  From the explanation of the victim: ‚ÄúOf course, I had bad feelings about when the doorbell rang so late.  But I thought: I'm a healthy man, and how will I shiver behind the door in front of my children and wife?  Well, I discovered ... ". <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/989/7fd/853/9897fd8532c746ec821989ff42f5c703.jpg"><br><br>  In fact, nothing would have changed if not opened.  But not because such a rock is from above or, perhaps, reduced - where does rock come from at all?  Your children, relatives, acquaintances can be exposed by a bait, which you will see through the peephole of the video intercom camera.  Naturally, under the threat of an attached ‚Äúpiece of iron‚Äù to the side, no one will say a word about the danger of opening the door.  "Horse" - so fake victim is affectionately called in criminal jargon.  And urkoganam ancient history is not alien! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/9b2/62d/38d/9b262d38d0d34db1b7e4af7df2e93934.jpg"><br><br>  Everything!  Those who do not like the problem can no longer read, because there will be no more immersion in it.  For those who do not want to tremble every time when you open the door to a stranger or even to a loved one ... Tpru, we will not deceive, our own people are rarely used, sorry that they scared at the beginning, just laid down beautifully on the text.  Well, this can often be seen in TV shows - just like that, just through one on NTV.  The fact is that horror is easy to read in the eyes of loved ones.  Writers and directors, apparently, do not know.  In 90% of cases, according to our employees, who served in the criminal police for a long time (do not laugh, there is such a police - criminal, some do not know and will post error messages on the forum, such as "how can it be that we have police - completely criminal? "), yet the crimes of this nature are" on trust. "  They like to correct their native language here, so we will immediately explain that we have put quotes to reflect the professional term.  On the trust work really professionals, often with experience.  Just as you master the specialty of a programmer, they long learn to attract people to themselves.  They seem to be plumbers, doctors, social workers, even pregnant women - they ask for some water to drink or to take birth ... The last was - no joke.  In general, the whole sentence is better to remember, then we will say why. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/44c/237/901/44c237901fb74de383c3c3874ffce5f8.jpg"><br><br>  If you are allowed into an intruder‚Äôs house, it doesn‚Äôt mean that he will cut you down.  Most dashing people - the humble charm of crime.  These are the darlings who come to listen to your problems, drink a seagull and help with the increase of the pension or with the free connection of the water meter.  And they can even offer a government award - for the fact that you worked selflessly in your youth.  Well, somewhere there - where you worked. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f04/be9/3f2/f04be93f28094236a4185e25f9d26c0e.jpg"><br><br>  It is clear that with their departure you, most likely, will not count the number of stashes in the kitchen or some small, but expensive thing, everything is clear.  But we asked you to remember one important sentence that was said above.  According to our colleagues, the degree of danger of strangers is directly proportional to the idiocy of the reasons for their visit, which you hang on your ears (in translation: explain). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/3f6/078/340/3f607834099d40c1ac791197e38850a7.jpg"><br><br>  That's just a difficult task - to explain to us an explanation of idiocy, I'm sorry, it seems, the mind went to smoke for the mind.  Let's make it easier: if for the first time in your life you see a long-legged, blue-eyed beauty in a short skirt in front of the door of your apartment (yes, YOUR!) Is not a natural dream that you think about all the time, this is a setup!  Moreover, with craniocerebral 100%. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/558/ce2/170/558ce21705eb43f488aba54ce5ecb7a1.jpg"><br><br>  Not to help a woman, of course, sin is a sinful sin!  But do not rush to open a pregnant woman who decided to give birth in front of your door!  Oh, what are we spreading sinful teachings?  Better yet, open, otherwise it is a sin.  We are not joking, it is better to go to the next world without sin, than to repent all your life.  Although there is another option, for the sake of which we are writing this article ... So, let's finish the last thought.  The most dangerous visitors to trust are those who knock with a very unusual request.  If you open a simple ‚Äúsocial worker‚Äù or ‚Äúplumber‚Äù, in most cases you risk only property.  But, if this is a dying sexy beauty in front of your house, then this is the last thing you remember when you wake up in the hospital.  Of course, we do not in any way rule out the theoretical possibility that she just came to meet you, because she saw you on the subway and now cannot live without you.  Such cases also occur, although much less frequently, perhaps one in a billion. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/2fd/543/64a/2fd54364aef3487abc40631ffa244e55.jpg"><br><br>  How difficult it is to be a techie practitioner: if you want to talk about an interesting technology, your thoughts fly all the time to yesterday's robbing a cottage with a fatal outcome.  Judging by the cameras closest observation, two chela drove on something like a snowmobile.  Represent the owner's amazement!  This is in the month of May near Moscow.  Naturally, he did not take them for robbers, opened the door without a back thought.  Here on such effects you can enter any home.  Although it is now difficult to say how the matter really was, it is only known that the door was not broken. <br>  And yet about technology, here we come with them and leave with them.  Thanks to our readers, many give practical advice, confirm or refute our vision of such an everyday matter as domestic crime.  To some and even a very large extent, the logical ‚Äúdoorchain‚Äù logic algorithm will help protect against a dashing guest.  It can be implemented independently on elementary electronics or used in existing security systems at home.  The last thing is still to be looked for, unfortunately, the security market in our country is more of a market than of security: what is known and simple is selling well.  From the point of view of the theory, this is a violation of all security laws that say just the opposite: the security system algorithm is more reliable than less commonly used. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/767/f64/36d/767f6436d2ed4c6ba52b05b4f0d27aab.jpg"><br><br>  Perhaps this article will be read by about 20,000 people.  These are trifles, in comparison with the general population of the country, you can assume that you are touching the exclusive.  To build it is quite simple: two buttons and one timer with a relay.  One button activates the timer, turn off the other, that's it! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/65b/623/182/65b623182c7e4a13a1604c8a22be1cbf.jpg"><br><br>  Judging by the simplicity, it is possible to understand that the idea is brilliant, because ‚Äúall ingenious is simple.‚Äù  If you were able to master the usual timer, which you can buy in the nearest stores, then it remains only to correctly position the buttons or spend a little more money on the radio buttons that you do not need anywhere.  Someone has already become disillusioned with the fact that he read this article to the bottom - a simple alarm on the alarm button? <br><br>  No, not so simple.  Moreover, according to our estimates, it is possible to press the alarm button only in one case out of a thousand attacks.  We will not go into deduction, why - now is not about that.  In all cases, when taken by the throat, look for rescue device "is not the season."  But while you still decide to open the door to a stranger, shaking inside with fear (why hide a sin?), There is still time to take care of your safety.  Yes, and you will shake less, just press the first button, and only then open the door.  Accordingly, this button should be located in front of the door. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/118/62f/59c/11862f59c9e8421dab73efd34cd44c25.jpg"><br><br>  And then, you guessed it, you are brilliant, that this button starts the security timer, which can be stopped only by the second button - unknown to anyone but you.  If this is not done, there will be a ‚Äúboom‚Äù, then we will explain what this means.  And who can do it only?  And under what conditions?  That's right, only you and only if your hands are free, and there is a desire for it.  Could not physically press the second button - after a few minutes the time relay triggers, which in turn starts the ‚Äúboom‚Äù. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/1d9/635/a6f/1d9635a6fc6a4cf7b72cca8e764ec341.jpg"><br><br>  Sorry, because of my incompetent digressions, the article was a long one, so the description of the boom requires a separate topic.  But you already guessed that by triggering the relay, you can activate anything from sirens to calling the help desk.  The countermeasure algorithm can be both elementary and sophisticated.  For example, if you ask, we can talk about the principles of operation and programming of a special language of behavioral logic, with the help of which the current situation is constantly investigated and the reactions change under it.  Such a technology, according to the behavior of people, distinguishes its own from others, the livelihoods of the owners from the barbarian manners of uninvited guests.  Moreover, everything happens dynamically, which ensures the adequacy of the reactions.  On a conventional system, there is only the possibility of laying the algorithm: the sensor worked - to shoot a gun.  And the behavioral security logic examines who caused the drawdown, what preceded, what follows, whether to warn first ... <br><br>  By the way, the library of this logic is free when used on a small scale (apartment, house).  Naturally, if there are no requests, we will not raise this topic.  Now let's continue with the second button. <br><br>  So, you have activated the counteraction timer, and it will activate your defense in 5 minutes.  But a decent person came in, showed the certificate of a social worker, and he also brought a pension.  Well, it's not good to scare him and drench him.  Therefore, the timer should be interrupted, which can be done with the second button.  Versions of execution and its location may be different.  Moreover, there is no need to consult with anyone about this, it is YOUR PERSONAL security.  No friends - installers should not know about it. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a3a/8d6/f1a/a3a8d6f1a3e94ff19a327987920df251.jpg"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/0bd/1fa/70a/0bd1fa70a6b3425daaeb6fa0bea6d748.jpg"><br><br>  With all this, this button should be what is called, at hand, otherwise you will not get to it.  And there is no contradiction here; secrecy and ‚Äúmanual‚Äù are easily combined.  You can put an auto-contact opening any locker in the hallway.  Pretending that you put a scarf there, the system will receive a signal without any additional movements.  Or on a shelf you can put a vase, inside of which there is a reed switch.  It is necessary to move this beauty to the side - which will be equivalent to pressing the cancel button. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c88/369/bb2/c88369bb2399477096604903c04f4202.jpg"><br><br>  Of course, here we must be able to draw a line, but, apart from the two wires, there is nothing there, this is taught in physics in school.  If you are, absolutely ..., then you should pay extra for the radio button.  Keychain can be hidden anywhere - after the departure of installers. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f31/27f/5fa/f3127f5fa85142b395542eb5166e416f.jpg"><br><br>  The main thing is not to overdo it with hide-and-seek to find oneself.  Therefore, everything in this world should be physiological.  Ponder what you do when guests come, in which room you go, where you get up or sit down?  In some of these places and should be hidden button, camouflaged under the "bytovuhu." <br><br>  Naturally, do not forget about the collisions of the mind.  When talking to a visitor, you can forget about the need to deactivate the security system.  Therefore, it is recommended to set an audible warning on the timer when the security period is about to end.  This may be a signal such as a spent microwave or washing machine, so as not to attract attention. <br><br>  Physiology would be nice to add and at the press of the first button.  For example, use the intercom speakerphone.  When you come your own, you immediately open the door without using negotiations.  And if you picked up the phone to talk with someone about the purpose of the visit to you, you will hardly make a mistake if you immediately press the ‚Äúfirst button‚Äù combined with the opening of the door (as an option). <br><br>  In general, if everything is done physiologically, you will not even notice that you ensure your safety - all actions will be carried out by itself.  And even if you make a mistake, the ingenious electronics will remind you.  It is brilliant because it is simple - both in performance and in operation. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/369319/">https://habr.com/ru/post/369319/</a></p>
