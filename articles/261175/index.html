These may be places where you lived, where someone close to you lives, it is just interesting to follow the launch of rockets at Baikonur or Cape Canaveral, whatever, in fact, there is no limit to fantasy (and curiosity). <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  So, some time ago I was bored with my native places and decided to look "like there" through existing webcams.  Then came the inevitable disappointment of their apparent absence in my dear places.  After a short time, I thought, why not try to exploit this idea, as I am sure that there should be a lot of people who want to ‚Äúdrop in‚Äù.  I even suggested that something like this should already exist and, after a brief search, I did find two projects that were close in meaning, but none of them suited me.  After this moment, it took a long 3 years.  And now, after 3 years, I had time for my own realization.  I must say that during this time I naturally managed to share my reflections with my friends "over a cup".  And communicating with them assured me that if such a system existed, then it would certainly be used, like myself.  During these three years I have been torn by the ambivalent feeling that someone is about to implement the idea and I‚Äôll just start using this implementation and it‚Äôs great, but on the other hand, I‚Äôd be a little upset, since I myself would like to make my own implementation.  And the moment has come. <br>  Since I am an adept ondroed-camp, the choice fell on android and android-studio.  However, the version for ios is also in development, but according to my estimates, the result will appear no sooner than by the fall.  This is my first project, both for android, and in android-studio.  So I had to spend extra time digging in the appropriate docks. <br>  Currently ready so-called.  proof of concept.  The front-end, as I said, has been implemented so far only for android, the back-end is implemented using Google Cloud Storage, Google Cloud Messaging, Google Cloud SQL. <br>  I will dwell on the idea itself.  So, I presented an average user who would like to look, for example, in the city of Barcelona, ‚Äã‚Äãwhere he recently, and maybe long ago, rested.  To do this, he goes to the market (about the market just below in more detail), downloads the application, launches, filters photos at a place and time, and sees that the hotel was demolished, well, or anything else, but the crucial point is that he gets what he All this, starting with the installation of the application, was undertaken.  Obviously, in order for the system to work, it must contain these same photos from around the world.  And for this purpose serves one small, but very important requirement.  Namely, in order to log in, he must take a photo in the place where he himself is ‚Äúhere and now‚Äù (although it does not matter from the office or car window).  The photo made by him at the same moment (on the side of the backend) will notify everyone who subscribes to this area.  To avoid, as I called them dangling notifications (when two people from two cities are subscribed to the second city and have to take a photo again and again, because they do not stop receiving notifications), the choice is made when subscribing to an area, how often to receive notifications from this area .  The available options are no more than once per minute, per hour, per day, per week. <br>  Among other things, I decided to weaken the important requirement to take a photo each time a person launches an application (either when receiving an alert or on their own initiative).  For this, at registration, five so-called ones are added.  passes, when you can simply answer "next time" and access the map and all markers on it.  If a person decided to take a photo at the start, then three new passes are added to him.  Of course, they accumulate and, ideally, upon receiving a notification, a person will never turn his head in the office in thoughts about where to approach the window, but this time he simply misses the shooting proposal and looks at what came of it. <br>  The project did about two months and, if we consider that this is my first experience, it is not so long.  Honestly, if I sat down to do the same, I would do it 4 times faster, and this is understandable.  About the market.  Since I feel a significant lack of users, I decided that the project was in no way ready for the market, so I decided to invite people via the link and update the program automatically at the start if an update is available.  Yes, and, as I said earlier, this is still proof of concept, so I‚Äôm referring to the client under android.  Perhaps, taking into account all the wishes, the application will simply be rewritten "from scratch" to be worthy of the market (at least in my eyes). <br><br>  You can download the application on <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details%3Fid%3Dcom.project_x.pavel.myapplicationx">GooglePlay</a> <br><br>  A few explanations: <br>  1. All the problems "led" in trello, a really useful service.  Literally ‚Äúon the go‚Äù I added bugs / ideas and, starting to work, I opened my own board and worked on everything that was added.  At the moment, a lot of ideas have accumulated, which in the near future will be relatively easy to add.  But priorities decide everything, which at the moment I consider the work on the version for ios and the correction of bugs.  Also for feedback I sketched a forum where you can leave your comments, suggestions, questions (for convenience - in English and Russian).  <a href="http://px.boards.net/">Forum</a> . <br>  2. The program interface is all in English, for anyone on Habr√© this is not a problem.  Although the translation is also on the To do list. <br>  3. instagram added search for photos by location (and maybe not only instagram).  But until I find out that there is a serious player on the market offering an in-place subscription, I will continue to work on the project.  By the way, this is a hobby, I can cut endlessly, even if the implementation of the idea appears, but I do not like it. <br>  4. I know and love the google streetview service, but in theory my project should look into places ‚Äúinaccessible‚Äù for google streetview car, as, in fact, much more often than streetview is updated.
