Mobile technology turns everything into B2P - a business for people</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  A business will always go well if it is committed to truly improving the lives of its customers.  And mobile technology can help. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  More and more, CIO and CTO are beginning to understand the potential of mobile technologies in real improving and simplifying the lives of people, whether they are employees or customers. <br><br>  Let's look at the example of Bangladesh bank Dutch-Bangla Ltd.  Having a strong light industry base, the standard of living and wages have increased significantly in Bangladesh over the past 10 years.  However, only 13% of the 160 million people in Bangladesh have a bank account.  This is easily explained by the absence of bank branches in rural areas where most of Bangladesh‚Äôs population lives. <br><br>  ‚ÄúHowever, about half of the remaining 87% use mobile communications,‚Äù said Abul Kashem Shirin, deputy general director of Dutch-Bangla Ltd, in the Mobile Innovations and Customer Interface section of the SAPPHIRE conference held in May 2012 in Orlando NOW.

      Seeing an empty niche in the market, the bank launched a mobile banking service operating on Sybase 365. ‚ÄúToday, our customers, many of whom live too far from banks, can conduct all types of banking operations,‚Äù he said.  This allowed tens of millions of Bangladesh residents to open a bank account for the first time, and start saving and saving their savings. <br><br><img src="http://cdn-static.zdnet.com/i/story/62/16/003283/shutterstock_51887617.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <i>Most people in Bangladesh cannot save money because they live in villages that do not have banks.</i>  <i>Mobile banking solves this problem.</i> <br><br>  This example is an excellent proof that a business will always go well if it truly seeks to improve the lives of its customers and employees.  And this rule works not only in developing countries.  Another example: the watch manufacturer Fossil.  Their vice president of IT infrastructure, Mark Reynolds, spoke about a significant reduction in printing and paper costs for internal corporate documents.  An alternative is now a convenient corporate portal, which employees access from their tablets.  This approach is not only "greener", but also very much to the liking of the company's employees.  Fossil used SAP SUP to create a portal and mobile corporate applications, and SAP Afaria is used to monitor the security of corporate and personal mobile devices used for work (BYOD - bring your own device). <br><br>  The third example is the manufacturer of printing equipment Lexmark.  According to CIO of this company, Keith Moody, ‚Äúemployees want to have the same IT environment in the workplace to which they are accustomed at home‚Äù.  Lexmark simultaneously with the launch of a mobile CRM system for sales managers, and the FSI system for technicians on call, also launched a monthly stipend program for employees using their BYOD mobile devices for work purposes.  And, according to Moody, they are also planning to launch a whole range of mobile corporate applications that increase the efficiency and usability of both office workers and field specialists. <br><br>  ‚ÄúNow our reference points are no longer just B2B or B2C.  From now on, we are business for people, or B2P. ‚Äù  - said SAP president Sanjay Punen.  ‚ÄúMore and more people today receive information through their mobile devices, this is our way of life.  And these users expect a decent level of work of their business processes on their mobile devices.  Simply put, they want beautiful and user-friendly enterprise software. ‚ÄùPunen added. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/171061/">https://habr.com/ru/post/171061/</a></p>
