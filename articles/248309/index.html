The nuances of the filter, which every webmaster should know</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  <i>In this article, you will learn how the Yandex search engine is struggling with the cheating of behavioral factors and what is the danger for bona fide webmasters to lose positions for a long period.</i>  <i>The article will be useful both for specialists and novice webmasters, for whom I tried to paint the most difficult moments.</i> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  As soon as the search engine enters a significant ranking factor, SEO specialists immediately try to wind it up.  PS forced to run filters to somehow stabilize the issue.  In this case, absolutely any organization assumes in advance that there will be a certain percentage of the marriage.  However, in order to reduce costs in the PS, work is being done to automate the interaction with the representatives of the sites and at a certain stage of inconsistency, or lack of perception of the problem, can completely refuse to interact with them.  Refusal of interaction is primarily associated with a high percentage of complaints of those who are known to be guilty of sanctions of SEO specialists who seriously damaged the customer‚Äôs site and do not have the ability to fix the problem, but on the other hand that bona fide site owners simply do not have the necessary skills to find the cherished form and write to the mythical Plato Schukin.  Thus, the support service refuses to interact on certain issues in order to save on the payroll.  Since the end of 2014, they have included a branch of issues related to the cheat behavioral factors. <br><br>  It looks like this: if you still find the ‚ÄúFeedback‚Äù item in the webmaster panel, you will be taken to the list of common questions.  By choosing any branch similar to your theme, you get, in the context of behavioral factors, useless text and a list of possible actions: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/622/03d/c80/62203dc80ed64d0ca4f16eddf5f77529.gif">

      <br>
      And that's all.  Thus, search engine sanctions associated with the cheating behavioral factors <b>have become peremptory</b> .  This moment underlines the seriousness of this topic (how to find the form in the comments below). <br><br>  Before we talk about how not to become <i>an innocent</i> victim of this problem, let's talk quite a bit about who we owe to the attention of this filter and to those who have sharpened its algorithms. <br><br>  Cheating behavioral factors of the site in the "Yandex" is part of a set of measures to improve the position of the site seo-specialists.  Sometimes it is loudly called the <i>promotion of behavioral factors</i> .  In order to optimize labor costs, the seo specialist turns to special services, where a certain task is performed automatically or with the help of people for a small fee.  The limited variety of tasks (actions) and some associativity of the IP addresses of those doing the cheating gives the PS filter the conclusion that the behavioral ranking factor is twisted. <br><br>  So, we come to the first news, a letter of happiness from Yandex in the Webmaster panel.  You should regularly check <a href="https://webmaster.yandex.ru/messages/">this</a> mailbox, and if you don‚Äôt have one, register there and link your website to it. <br><br>  The letter will have a very detached, nothing threatening name, in the best styles of messages from Don Carleone: "On some methods of search engine optimization and their consequences." <br><br>  Here are the contents of the automatic letter at the end of 2014: <br><blockquote>  Hello! <br>  Recently, some SEO companies and services, including automated website promotion services, offer webmasters services related to "behavioral factors."  This can be called differently: ‚Äústrengthening of behavioral factors‚Äù, ‚Äúpromotion of behavioral factors‚Äù, ‚Äúbehavioral factors for all‚Äù, ‚Äústrengthening of references behavioral factors‚Äù and so on.  As a rule, under these names there is an attempt to deceive the search engine in various ways related to the emulation of user actions. <br>  Like other methods of cheating, this method has nothing to do with the actual improvement of the quality of the site in the interests of business and users.  Moreover, the development of such fraudulent methods, based on the fake actions of fake users, has a negative effect on confidence in the entire Internet industry. <br>  The use of such methods can adversely affect the trust of the search engine to the site and lead to a significant reduction in traffic.  More complete information about the attitude of Yandex to similar methods of promotion and their implications can be found in the Yandex blog for webmasters: <br>  On one of the incorrect methods of search engine promotion and its consequences <br>  On one of the incorrect methods of search engine promotion and its consequences - 2 <br>  Yandex recommends avoiding the use of these methods in their practice, and also to make sure that the companies and services whose services you use do not offer such methods of ‚Äúpromotion‚Äù. <br>  We wish you the right decisions in the coming year! </blockquote><br>  It's time to get scared when you see such a message, it is addressed to your website * and this, in essence, is nothing more than a classic <i>kiss of death</i> , because the whole intrigue of sending this message is that the sender assumes that you know what it is and will be next.  The hitch is that someone does not understand what they are talking about, because they do not know what is the reason, or, worse, does not know that it is he and his habits that is the reason.  Thus, he will do nothing, becoming a victim of search algorithms, <i>well, I did not do anything like that</i> !? <br>  * <i>Note of 01/21/2015: Letters from December 25 to 28, 2014 came in large quantities, perhaps Yandex first sent them out for prevention purposes and this is not related to a specific site.</i>  <i>In the future, it is necessary to clarify whether there is the same letter in other boxes of the ‚Äúwebmaster panels‚Äù.</i> <br><br>  After receiving the letter, it is important to analyze the situation and take the necessary action package during the week from the date specified in the letter. <br><br>  But back to the heart of the problem.  Now we are close to the close consideration of the imperfections of the filter of behavioral factors.  I will not conceal: the problem lies in the inconsistency of Yandex services and the inaccuracy of values ‚Äã‚Äãat low attendance rates. <br><br>  At one time, Andrei Kalinin, head of the Mail.ru search development team, said that site behavioral factors at low rates <i>cannot be fully used in the ranking formula</i> .  And it seems that the main search algorithms have already learned how to work in this regard adequately, but the filter affected here does not have this grace, since it is not associated with the main search engine.  And this can be clearly noticed by analyzing the site that fell under the sanctions in various regions and domains of the Yandex PS.  It simply corrects the value of the positions.  At the same time, it does not have a low cutoff.  Simply put, an inadequately tuned algorithm will cut off your Top10 and everything for at least 2 weeks.  Will there be a sediment after this - is not known for certain.  There is nothing surprising in this ‚Äúheterogeneity‚Äù: different people work on issuing and filtering, they solve different tasks, their attention is drawn to different things, they are limited by the ability to disperse their attention to aspects that are less important for their work. <br><br>  And now let's go back to the thought above ‚Äú <i>I haven‚Äôt done anything like that.</i> ‚Äù <br><blockquote>  We will not even develop a story about your competitors who can give you a similar gift (and it is especially elegant to do so for a new player in the market, calculating the budget for positions in PS and CTR, and then letting in him the necessary percentage of the cheapest cheating) and return to stories of the common man and his site. </blockquote><br>  So, answer the question, but you did something on your website in principle?  You went to the site and did certain actions, perhaps you are the owner of the site 10 times a day, go down to the Yandex.Mestrica icon to look at the indicators, or edit the content right in your virtual hosting panel and update the content a hundred times a day, or just do the so-called stupid ... Remember your behavior on the site and mentally look at how your actions are alike, how refined they are, from what kind of ip ipies they are performed.  Are you already scared? <br><br>  And here's the basic idea: if you love your site and constantly visit pages with a low number of visitors (and, worse, with a positive trend in traffic), you can become a victim of the PF Yandex filter.  Remember: excessive love webmasters to the site banned. <br><br>  But stop!  When I visit, I go to Yandex.Metrica (he should understand this), or perhaps I‚Äôll have a tick in the metric ‚Äúdo not take into account my visits‚Äù.  And indeed, the visits will not be taken into account!  But, at the same time, they will be taken into account by the filter, because, paradoxically, the Yandex services are not coordinated in any way, which was confirmed by the Yandex representatives themselves.  This is done primarily so that people do not produce accounts, trying to bypass any service, so the search for all sorts of parsers does not go through the analysis of several accounts, but only within one current one. <br><br>  But the metric and the PF filter still have something in common - and this is the Yandex counter, a third-party product that you kindly agreed to install, and which works not only for your benefit, but also against (if you behave yourself, suspicious).  The second point is especially very slippery for site owners, because there is an opportunity to install third-party counters.  In the context of the topic, a script that monitors user behavior is especially dangerous in the Yandex counter code. <br><br>  And here it is, a great recipe: if your website‚Äôs page has an average of <i>less than 50 visitors per month</i> and you don‚Äôt cheat, safely remove the scalpel from your Yandex.Metrict counter.  I seriously recommend leaving you only the following code: <br><br><pre><code class="html hljs xml"><span class="hljs-tag"><span class="hljs-tag">&lt;</span><span class="hljs-name"><span class="hljs-tag"><span class="hljs-name">img</span></span></span><span class="hljs-tag"> </span><span class="hljs-attr"><span class="hljs-tag"><span class="hljs-attr">src</span></span></span><span class="hljs-tag">=</span><span class="hljs-string"><span class="hljs-tag"><span class="hljs-string">"//mc.yandex.ru/watch/_"</span></span></span><span class="hljs-tag">&gt;</span></span></code> </pre> <br>  With such low rates, behavioral factors do not matter for the PS ranking formula, but the filter is already running.  You increase your risks, and in return do not get anything.  If you are in the commercial field, it is especially dangerous. <br><br>  And <i>one more thing</i> about when you break through the issue and go to your own site or do not even do the latter.  This is very dangerous, even if you are logged in as the site owner.  There is no consistency of services, you will be taken into account as a regular visitor ... a <i>strange</i> visitor, and, the lower the attendance on the village you like to visit, the more chances to get an anathema from the search engine "Yandex". </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/248309/">https://habr.com/ru/post/248309/</a></p>
