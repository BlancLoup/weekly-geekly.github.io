  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Dobrodel website is ready to help, but do others want it?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Unauthorized garbage dumps are a rather common problem of the regions, since there are areas with private houses in the regions.  In multi-storey residential buildings, the payment of garbage collection services usually comes with a rent.  Owners (owners of private one-two-storey houses) often do not express the desire to spend money on garbage collection, so they throw garbage into the next dumpster allocated for the needs of other houses, or throw garbage everywhere, which is why such piles of garbage are formed. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/0fd/cac/f08/0fdcacf08b61472b8ca9f29a2b52f1b8.jpg"><br><br>  In the summer, parents in the house had problems affecting utilities.  I did not deal with the problem on my own, but I shared the Dobrodel website on the Internet (the Dobrodela community works with problems in the Moscow Region).  On this site, you only need to leave a request about the problem, after which the Virtue fights against injustice (writes complaints and statements to the executive authorities, but on your behalf).  Therefore, I decided to go there with the urgent problem of unauthorized dumps. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/cbe/1e0/2c9/cbe1e02c9ba0833721150187538273bf.jpg" alt="image">

    <h3>  Attempt number one </h3><br>  A complaint was filed containing a very picturesque photograph posted at the beginning of the article.  As usual, after moderating the complaint, the deadline for resolving the problem was set.  Responsible for solving the problem was assigned to the city administration.  Trash has been removed.  I received a response from the administration with a photo as evidence of the work done. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/1e2/941/ea1/1e2941ea1c0f4257b2a0e8aa77a0060a.png"><br><br>  Yes, and my parents called, were very surprised that the garbage raked.  But early rejoiced.  The very next day, some not very good people threw several packages of garbage at the same place. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e68/96e/f70/e6896ef7063d428eba6ba867a39ed8d8.jpg"><br><br>  In short, clean - do not clean, sense something.  All the same, there are comrades who threw and will throw garbage anywhere.  What happened clearly describes the words "Purely not where they clean, but where they don't litter". <br><br><h3>  Attempt number two </h3><br>  But I did not despair.  Marked the problem as unresolved and resubmitted the request for consideration of the problem, explaining the situation.  Again, she sent them a photo of a new trash formation.  I also wrote that if the violation can be stopped only by installing video surveillance, then the application can not be considered.  Just a trashcan, the elimination of which is at stake, is not in the house where the parents live.  And when I come to them, she blinds the eyes along the way, and this is unpleasant. <br><br>  The re-sent request to solve the problem was not rejected, the garbage was taken out in a week. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/55e/0ec/ef8/55e0ecef88c54008b1855b981374cc2a.png"><br><br>  The new response from the administration had a slightly different content, it was mentioned that ‚ÄúOwners who do not have an agreement (on garbage collection) are notified of the imposition of an administrative fine‚Äù: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ddb/27f/ddf/ddb27fddf5dd492f9236a0354089a095.png"><br><br>  But, apparently, these are just words, because after another week the pile of garbage reappeared and continues to grow. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a1d/f4a/fbe/a1df4afbe9ca48f98a6a9dbfe0ce764a.jpg"><br><br>  So, if you have any problems concerning the improvement or the suppression of unrest in the house or yard, you can turn to the <a href="http://vmeste.mosreg.ru/">Dobrodel</a> .  But as you can see, in the case of unauthorized landfills, this is not always solved only by a single or double garbage collection.  To solve this problem, it is not necessary to treat the symptoms, but rather to take tough measures in order to eradicate the evil.  But at least I tried and did everything possible. <br><br>  Let's keep clean and tidy not only in the house, but beyond its limits.  Let's respect others. <br><br>  And remember: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ba3/2d9/855/ba32d9855d0343fe990b55c6d667cbd0.jpg"></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/399199/">https://habr.com/ru/post/399199/</a></p>
