We now have a similar story with wireless headphones: we forced ourselves to look for headphones with stable synchronization and recently (if possible) we have to listen to everything that comes handy. <br><br>  This time TWS-headphones MyDrops appeared in our ears. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  It will probably take a little more time, and such a question as ‚Äúsynchronization on the street‚Äù will disappear, but so far this is still one of the important criteria, and not all headphones deal with it.

      Some Chinese wireless plugs still ‚Äúdelight‚Äù with an out of sync, breaking the connection in an open space, just like a few years ago, when <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/399407/">absolutely everyone</a> was sinning with <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/399407/">it</a> . <br><br>  <b>General impressions</b> <br><br>  But the situation is changing for the better, and <a href="https://medgadgets.ru/shop/besprovodnye-naushniki-s-mikrofonom-mydrops.html%3Futm_source%3Dhabr%26utm_medium%3Dmydrops%26utm_campaign%3Dmydrops">MyDrops</a> , fortunately, falls into the category of good headphones, which have no problem with the connection both in and outside the room.  For the test, as usual, various pockets of trousers and jackets were used: everywhere on the street music was stable and without gaps was fed into the ears. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/43/af/np/43afnpsmiqcjeextpin0lk3fhjm.jpeg"><br><br>  These are the second headphones after <a href="https://habr.com/ru/company/medgadgets/blog/444188/">CG Pods</a> , which pleased in a good way.  Moreover, the price tag of these "ears" is more pleasant.  Imports a headphone "Djadzhet".  Therefore, we consider that it is once again important to stand up for them: this is one of the good and useful products, which is relatively inexpensive. <br><br>  Of course, exceptionally friendly, it is impossible not to ask them about the instructions: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/5j/l5/v6/5jl5v61zml7dhduiv6z8ghekhl0.png"><br><br>  Why, where the left is, ‚ÄúR‚Äù is signed, and where the right is ‚ÄúL‚Äù, but, by and large, this is not critical.  Headphones sit well and comfortably in your ears, they are not heavy and do not want to fall out.  We have not tested them in any sports scenario, but in dynamic movement along the street they sit firmly (the weight of one earphone is 4 - 5 grams). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ol/nf/op/olnfop2smjlxw71u8nmuze7qudm.jpeg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/tk/ov/af/tkovaft-gmhwpbekpyojahsgo-m.jpeg"><br><br>  Ears are an individual matter.  In our case, the speakers stick out a bit, there were photos where MyDrops are ‚Äúdeeper‚Äù and almost invisible from the front.  In any case, in the process of using <b>headphones as an accessory,</b> they did not show themselves negatively: they are comfortable and light. <br><br>  <b>Sound</b> <br><br>  The perception of sound is subjective, of course.  It may depend on many factors, codecs and other things.  Nevertheless, we try to characterize MyDrops. <br><br>  First, they sound good and loud out of the box.  For other headphones, this was not typical - it was necessary to play a little with the standard equalizer of the VLC player before they began to produce a pleasant sound.  For example, on the Iphone the same CG Pods were not immediately pleased.  Or from the gags, <a href="https://habr.com/ru/company/medgadgets/blog/403091/">Xiaomi Piston</a> , which were deaf from the box and barely audible, come from the box. <br><br>  No donastrok is needed here: MyDrops sound very decently for three thousand rubles, they are comparable in their class and pretty well pass all the available ‚Äúonline tests‚Äù from YouTube.  Decent bass, good middle and good detail.  Audio quality is not necessary to wait, but you can enjoy the music on the road. <br><br>  We heard the rumble ‚Äúbelow‚Äù between 20-30 Hz without any distortions and unnecessary hindrances, but we stopped hearing the upper frequencies by 15,000. On different programs (and different commercials), in the upper range, we heard rare crackles.  Still, for the gags, they cope with the sound well. <br><br>  To check the positioning of sounds, we used this ‚Äúroom‚Äù here: <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/s3eOuqAmLAA" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  In principle, they passed the test quite well, but there is one thing, which still probably will not allow such headphones to become headphones for gamers - as in a number of other models, there is a minimal delay here, and it behaves strangely. <br><br>  For example, when viewed through VLC, nothing of the kind is observed: the lips fall into words, in general, but with the same YouTube, a second rassinhron.  But then again - this is not an exceptional problem of MyDrops: it was the same with CG Pods, there is something similar with conventional wireless plugs. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/yc/an/fa/ycanfagur3yddqho-zo26ah8dta.jpeg"><br><br>  We compared two working models: 1 (red wire) - this is the usual Chinese nouneym from Alik - there is the same problem.  2 - this is crowdfunding EOZ - there are no problems with YouTube and there are no delays.  In general - once at a time. <br><br>  But, if you don‚Äôt take video, then complex compositions sound quite decently, though without any revelations, however, for example, in Led Zeppelin it is clear who is closer, who is farther, etc. As a result - for its price - quite decent sound. <br><br>  The only piece where they are not very much, surprisingly: here, <a href="https://vocaroo.com/i/s05mGeP2FZrV">where the pipe enters</a> .  Sounds somehow mix up, some porridge turns out, it is a little "saw".  But to say 100% that this is a MyDrops problem is difficult: all the plugs available at hand give roughly the same detail. <br><br>  Again, all this is on the default settings, standard codecs in mp3 format.  But, as an intermediate result, <b>headphones as a means of transmitting sound</b> produce a fairly decent quality for their form and price. <br><br>  <b>Headphones as a gadget</b> <br><br>  Here we can safely say that they are the simplest.  There are no problems during use: when you first turn on, you need to hold the power button on both speakers a little longer to put the headphones into pairing mode - then find them in the settings and - everything is ready.  In the future, they will "cling" automatically. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/8u/l1/p5/8ul1p5zbwjyhfcokq6f4satw4wi.jpeg"><br><br>  Buttons are oblong inserts on the speakers, they are also marked with letters, and diode indicators are built into them. <br><br>  Headphones come with a charging case, which is for them and something like a case. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/_x/4y/sn/_x4ysnrcjedoeag4xpi0znzqdpw.jpeg"><br><br>  A similar constructive solution was in Rowkin models, for example. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Rowkin</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/vq/uc/me/vqucmeo2ht0a3td-4p9txxvlape.jpeg"><br></div></div><br>  At first glance, this does not look like a very reliable solution, but on the whole in your pocket it‚Äôs not in a hurry to disintegrate: a weak magnet keeps the headphones well in the case. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/b6/ol/7c/b6ol7c7hoinvfddcbc8bikimnik.gif"><br><br>  The case is designed for charging headphones.  The declared operating time of the speakers from one charge is approx.  3 hours  The case should be enough for three to four cycles, that is, the total time of sound is up to 12. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/vx/nx/w7/vxnxw7xcmlwqkkaiqn-xxld0glg.jpeg"><br>  <i>Contacts</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/x3/ug/yp/x3ugypvbi6fcxhuobuiogoqib8o.jpeg"><br><br>  MyDrops are usually equipped with: inside the manual, charging cable, interchangeable silicone lining in several sizes. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/vy/ik/wh/vyikwhva-rwdidkbtulei_dxjhk.jpeg"><br><br>  In general, we must admit that everything is at a fairly decent level.  Headphones <b>as a gadget</b> please with ease of connection and management.  It is enough to get down to a few simple actions-press for play / pause, answer the call (there is a microphone) and that's it. <br><br>  <b>Specifications</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ns/my/sn/nsmysnachd5zk7ptyaa_olm5ayi.png"><br><br>  <b>Headphones as a commodity</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/04/2l/dh/042ldhhmiz8max2shiwalxi8_gc.jpeg"><br><br>  In general, according to MyDrops, such a conclusion suggests itself - that they are, as it were, average (in a good way).  The usual good sound, the average characteristics of autonomy for its class, the average grade required, the average weight in the class, the average size and so on.  In this case, the average is probably correctly replaced by <i>competitive ones</i> . <br><br>  About the price you can say about the same: it is average.  There are headphones and cheaper and more expensive, but in this niche with such characteristics it seems to be profitable.  Plus, until the end of the week, you can use the 10% discount coupon - <b>MYDROPS10</b> , if you <a href="https://medgadgets.ru/shop/besprovodnye-naushniki-s-mikrofonom-mydrops.html%3Futm_source%3Dhabr%26utm_medium%3Dmydrops%26utm_campaign%3Dmydrops">want to buy them</a> . <br><br>  We were glad to hear that the niche is really changing for the better: firstly, it becomes cheaper under the onslaught of the closest Chinese competitors, and secondly, these headphones have ceased to sacrifice something: here the sound is decent and Bluetooth has been repaired.  Where the main characteristic used to be ‚Äúconvenient‚Äù, now the competition is conducted in other parameters, and all other things being equal - MyDrops looks good. <br><br>  What we really lack in cheap TWS headphones is the ‚Äúaudio transparency‚Äù function, which provided some kind of safety on the street, on the road.  This was in the Bragi Dash and IconX, and, in headphones with a microphone, this does not seem very difficult, but unfortunately this is not the case with cheap headphones. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/448342/">https://habr.com/ru/post/448342/</a></p>
