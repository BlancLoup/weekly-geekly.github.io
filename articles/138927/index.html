  <section class="page js-page"><h1>JavaScript Conference</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  On Saturday <b>, February 18, 2012</b> , EPAM Systems, in its central office in Kiev, organized and held a conference dedicated to JavaScript, one of the most dynamically developing platforms today.  The conference attracted the attention of many Ukrainian developers - the hall was packed "to the eyeballs", and those who could not be present in person, watched the event online.  First of all, this was facilitated by reports on current topics of JS-development, both from client applications and from the server. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The conference was opened by the Director of Personnel - <b>Olesya Kirilchuk</b> . <br>  Then <b>Eldar Jafarov</b> talked about Node.js, the server-side JavaScript engine that is gaining popularity. <br>  <b>Denis Radin</b> showed how to organize the assembly, and delivery to the server of complex JavaScript projects using Gragle. <br>  <b>Aleksey Khristov</b> touched upon one of the most serious topics - unit testing of client-side JavaScript code.  Alexey reviewed several frameworks, and gave many useful recommendations on how to improve the process of writing tests. <br>  <b>Vladimir Kirillov</b> made a presentation on how to debug and optimize server applications using dtrace.  A rather exotic, but very effective way, especially when it comes to a running server application that cannot be stopped.  The report of Vladimir was accompanied by a live presentation. <br><br>  After the traditional reports, the time has come for <b>Lightning Talks</b> - short 7-minute speeches.  Already 12 people decided to go to the microphone and tell about their experience.  They talked about everything, ranging from the use of Open Source projects to develop developer skills, to rather exotic topics such as applications for set-top boxes and audio processing by means of a browser.  I especially want to mention the report of Timofey Babich, a representative of the Mozilla Foundation, who spoke about the development strategy of Firefox and shared some wonderful souvenirs with the browser logo (a couple of fox stickers appeared on the covers of laptops instead of standard Dell and HP logos). <br><br>  In between reports, EPAM Systems organized several contests.  To begin with, the participants tried to guess how much the EPAM share at the end of the 1st day of the IPO bid was worth.  With this simple question, Olesya began a very pleasant tradition, handing the tropical fruit to the smartest participant of the conference, this time the prize is pineapple.  In the lunch break, when everyone had a bite of sandwiches, another pleasant surprise was waiting for the participants - a lottery draw.  The owners of the "lucky numbers" got useful prizes for each developer: a stand for a laptop, a certificate for 1000 hryvnia to the electronics store "Rosette" and a removable disk the size of a terabyte.

      <b>The event was initiated by Yuri Bura</b> , the organizer of the Ukrainian JavaScript team.  For several weeks, he helped us create a site for registration, organize a video broadcast, and create a timeline conference.  At the end of the event, some of the participants went to the after party in the Chest, where they continued to communicate, but in an informal setting over a beer and billiard table. <br><br>  EPAM was pleased to provide a JavaScript user group with a venue for this conference.  The platform for meetings of this kind is now available to everyone.  If you have an idea for a conference, a development club, a hackathon, or any other event related to IT, EPAM will be happy to arrange comfortable communication in both formal and informal settings. <br><br>  Photo report <a href="https://www.facebook.com/media/set/%3Fset%3Da.291568794243988.71153.194846543916214%26type%3D1">here.</a> <br><br>  We are always open to your ideas and suggestions. <br>  Send event ideas to olena_yermakova AT epam.com <br><br>  Thank you so much for all the parties and exchange of experience. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/138927/">https://habr.com/ru/post/138927/</a></p>
