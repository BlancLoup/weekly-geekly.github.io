  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Coworking in Saratov - report on the birth</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  In the middle of January, I wrote a <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/165593/">post</a> in which I proposed to make coworking to local masters of keyboard and mouse in Saratov.  Then I promised to tell you what will come of this venture.  And now I got around to write a report about how it was. <br><br>  For the most impatient I will say at once - we did it!  The further text can be considered as a manual for building coworking with your own hands. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  After about 10 days after the post on the Habr√©, I had enough of requests from potential co-formers to have enough for us to occupy a whole table in a cafe, where the first meeting of co-orkers took place.  7 people came to that meeting.  After drinking coffee and making acquaintance, it was decided that the co-work should be.  This decision started the muddy phase of coworking origin called ‚ÄúOffice search‚Äù, at which a part of the participants of the cafe meeting fell off.  Initially, we were looking for an office in the center on the Internet and in newspapers, but many offers that were inadequate to our financial capabilities and aesthetic feelings made it necessary to expand the geography of searches.  There was even a funny moment when the owner of the premises led us to some kind of a barn or a shed, in the city center and to our reasonable question ‚Äúwhen will we go to see the office?‚Äù Could only mumble that, ‚Äúthis one, and we already in the office ‚Äù:) However, any entertainment once came to an end, and as a result we found a room.  As it happens (taking into account our budget constraints), it was unsuitable for immediate use for coworker purposes and a new ‚ÄúStart‚Äù phase began.  We collected money, imported furniture, bought mops, napkins and chairs, a dog bit on the street and tore off a piece of my jeans when I went to connect to the Internet (I connected the Internet that day, right in torn jeans) :) But we also passed and at one point, which occurred on February 25 of this year, coworking in Saratov earned!  We did this by putting together a team along the way.

      Since initially there was a task to make coworking for ourselves, so that it was comfortable to work in it, we built it as a club.  New coworkers are welcome after approval by the current.  We organized barbecues and poker on Friday, going to the pizza party with the mafia and participated in the tender for the development solely by the efforts of the co-workers.  Coworking is now exactly as I imagined it when I wrote that post.  I enjoy going to work every day, which I have not noticed for many years. <br><br>  And yet, if you plan to open your coworking, then know that it is at least hemorrhoid, but these efforts will pay off in the end.  It's great when cool people work with you, with whom you could do something good together.  And yes, if you are thinking of doing your coworking - contact, write in a personal, with pleasure I will share the experience that I was able to acquire. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/99c/d27/f93/99cd27f938c098161d0f4e28a7cf18c9.jpg" alt="our pirate flag"><br><br>  PS And on the most prominent place in the co-working we have a huge pirate flag. <br><br>  PPS When we settle down completely and make repairs in cheerful colors - I will post pictures and tell about it. <br><br>  PPPS You can contact me in the LAN on Habr√© or in the <a href="">mail</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/176781/">https://habr.com/ru/post/176781/</a></p>
