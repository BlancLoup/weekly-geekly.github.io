I did not consciously approach the choice at that time and wanted to correct it, so I decided to look at the current decisions. <br><br>  The thought would not have occurred to me if the Raspberry Pi (RPi) board was not at hand, the popularity of which goes off-scale - this means one thing: trying new assembly systems should be easier than ever. <br><br>  Looking ahead, I want to say that I wanted to choose an assembly system for any board, whether it‚Äôs RPi or not - it‚Äôs not important and I was pleasantly surprised by the number of solutions that have already been made for this board.

    <a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h4>  Motive </h4><br>  About two or three years ago, my main and only build system was <a href="http://www.openembedded.org/wiki/Main_Page">OpenEmbedded</a> , so it turned out that there was no need to try something else.  I just decided that it is better to study one system well and the fact that it is popular is only a plus, rather than go the other way and try as many build systems as possible. <br><br>  My opinion now is that at that time I didn‚Äôt have a debugging board for which there were solutions for other build systems.  But there were no such solutions as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raspberry_Pi">RPi</a> , but I‚Äôm cunning - there was a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BeagleBoard">BeagleBoard</a> board, but if you choose now, RPi is much cheaper. <br><br>  Therefore, starting all over again, I wanted to try to approach the choice of assembly systems more consciously and at the same time to see if something had changed.  (and really changed) <br><br>  <i>The goal of this article</i> is to introduce very briefly the assembly systems and give the most working instructions to avoid a bad impression. <br><br>  I gave a brief excerpt about all the impressions in the section ‚ÄúConclusion‚Äù, so you can safely go there if you do not want to waste your time on assembling images. <br><br><h5>  Why do you need it </h5><br>  Suppose you want to build your image for RPi and are faced with the choice of how to do it (the <i>image</i> is GNU / Linux based firmware for the debugging board) and you do not know where to start. <br><br>  Here you will find a way to do it, but not one, but 6 at once, because I managed to try so many assembly systems. <br><br><h5>  Who is this article useful for? </h5><br>  This article is intended for a person who understands the Linux-a command line, since  All examples considered in it were checked under Arch Linux x84_64, which means that they most likely will work for you too. <br><br>  He will also have to install the missing packages and programs needed for the build system that he chooses through the application manager of his system.  This step is very simple, because  almost every build system itself indicates which program is not installed. <br><br>  The rest of the article provides simple instructions for assembling, gives a list of solutions to the problems that have appeared. <br><br>  And of course, do not forget that the article is designed for RPi. <br><br><h5>  Criteria </h5><br>  I have several criteria for the build system: <br><ol><li>  I have to like her </li><li>  It should work under GNU / Linux. </li><li>  It should be comfortable </li></ol><br><br>  I will explain them: <br><br>  Like, the system that I want to use and a year and two and 5 +.  And if there is no support for my debug board, then I‚Äôll add it with pleasure. <br><br>  My main system is Arch Linux x86_64. <br><br>  Convenience is the availability of documentation, performance, i.e.  it is convenient to work with her. <br><br><h4>  List of build systems </h4><br>  I already knew several build systems, such as OpenEmbedded and PTXdist, the search gave me a few more, but later I took the list <a href="http://elinux.org/Build_Systems">here</a> : <br><br><ul><li>  Openbricks </li><li>  LTIB </li><li>  PTXdist </li><li>  Yocto Project / OpenEmbedded </li><li>  OpenWRT / BuildRoot </li></ul><br><br>  The list is compiled from the least to the most liked system. <br><br><h5>  Observations in difference assemblies </h5><br><ul><li>  Each build system has its own way or script to load the image. </li><li>  Each assembly system has been created, by any particular organization, for its own needs. </li><li>  You can observe how the instructions change as you move from one system to another, the latter seem to me almost perfect. </li></ul><br><br><h4>  Assembly systems </h4><br><h5>  Highlights </h5><br>  Before proceeding to the assemblies themselves, here I will describe the main points that were used in the preparation of the description. <br><br><ul><li>  Each system description contains a separate section with errors that occurred to me when executing instructions to leave instructions in a simple and understandable form. </li><li>  Each description contains a section with links used resources in the article. </li><li>  Each description contains a section with ‚ÄúAbout the System‚Äù, where he tried to give his own idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe system and share his impression of use.  Full description of the system itself can be found on the corresponding site. </li><li>  In the instructions there is a variable SANDBOX, entered it to simplify the recording of instructions, points to any directory you choose </li><li>  Did not begin to consider the lack of packages required for assembly.  (such as gcc, git, etc.) </li></ul><br><br><h5>  Openbricks </h5><br><h6>  About the system </h6><br>  This is the build system used by the <a href="http://www.geexbox.org/">GeeXBox</a> project - a Linux distribution with a media center. <br><br>  For me, it turned out to be the most difficult to use, because there are no instructions for assembling as such, there is a very simple description and it does not work, but I managed to figure out and build the image and it started, but ... gave an error. <br><br>  But, you can try already collected images on the project page (see links) <br><br><h6>  Instructions </h6><br>  I tried to collect the image under the main (host) machine, errors appeared (see errors), I got tired. <br>  I downloaded the image of Ubuntu under VirtualBox, I launched it under it, it did not get together, it turned out there was a problem in understanding. <br><br>  I tried to build an image using the OpenBricks repository, but it turned out to be more test, i.e.  On the GeeXBox website, it is written that if there is not going there, then this is normal.  The working one turned out to be the GeeXBox repository, but the build via make menuconfig was not successful, so it was decided to use make * defconfig. <br><br>  Using these instructions, an image was obtained: <br><br><pre><code class="bash hljs"><span class="hljs-built_in"><span class="hljs-built_in">export</span></span> OB=<span class="hljs-variable"><span class="hljs-variable">$SANDBOX</span></span>/ob mkdir <span class="hljs-variable"><span class="hljs-variable">$OB</span></span> &amp;&amp; <span class="hljs-built_in"><span class="hljs-built_in">cd</span></span> <span class="hljs-variable"><span class="hljs-variable">$OB</span></span> hg <span class="hljs-built_in"><span class="hljs-built_in">clone</span></span> http://hg.geexbox.org/geexbox <span class="hljs-built_in"><span class="hljs-built_in">cd</span></span> geexbox make geexbox-xbmc-bcm2708-raspberrypi_defconfig make <span class="hljs-comment"><span class="hljs-comment"># #   # wget http://download.geexbox.org/snapshots/geexbox-xbmc-bcm2708-raspberrypi/latest/binaries.raspberrypi/make-sdcard chmod +x make-sdcard ./make-sdcard /dev/mmcblk0 geexbox-3.0.raspberrypi.tar.bz2 raspberrypi</span></span></code> </pre> <br><br><h6>  Errors </h6><br><ul><li>  Not found <code>first32k.bin</code> .

Those.  it turns out that the image is going for two actions, and not for one.  Perhaps this is a minus. <br><br>  In the past, this system seemed to me quite interesting.  It was convenient to use, and the code inside it is structured and readable. <br><br><h6>  Instructions </h6><br>  At the first search I found on <a href="https://github.com/fabricega/OSELAS.BSP-RaspberryPi">github-e a</a> variant of this build system for RPi, but I could not build it (the compiler was assembled, there was no image).  The problem, as it seems to me, is that according to probability it was compiled under debian Linux, which is most likely ubunta, but I don‚Äôt have it. <br><br>  But I did not want to stop and believe that no one used this build system for RPi.  And I found an option that is on the main Pengutronix repository. <br><br>  Instructions that allowed me to build an image (and pay attention to the section with errors below): <br><br><pre> <code class="bash hljs"><span class="hljs-built_in"><span class="hljs-built_in">export</span></span> PTX=<span class="hljs-variable"><span class="hljs-variable">$SANDBOX</span></span>/ptx mkdir <span class="hljs-variable"><span class="hljs-variable">$PTX</span></span> &amp;&amp; <span class="hljs-built_in"><span class="hljs-built_in">cd</span></span> <span class="hljs-variable"><span class="hljs-variable">$PTX</span></span> <span class="hljs-comment"><span class="hljs-comment"># #  ptxdist # git clone git://git.pengutronix.de/git/ptxdist.git cd ptxdist/ ./autogen.sh mkdir out ./configure --prefix=`pwd`/out make &amp;&amp; make install export PATH=`pwd`/out/bin:$PATH cd .. # #  toolchain # wget http://www.ptxdist.de/oselas/toolchain/download/OSELAS.Toolchain-2011.11.3.tar.bz2 tar -xjf OSELAS.Toolchain-2011.11.3.tar.bz2 cd OSELAS.Toolchain-2011.11.3/ ptxdist select ptxconfigs/arm-1136jfs-linux-gnueabi_gcc-4.6.2_glibc-2.14.1_binutils-2.21.1a_kernel-2.6.39-sanitized.ptxconfig ptxdist --force menuconfig ptxdist --force go cd .. # #   # git clone http://git-public.pengutronix.de/git-public/OSELAS.BSP-Pengutronix-Generic.git cd OSELAS.BSP-Pengutronix-Generic git clone git://git.pengutronix.de/git/platform-pengutronix-raspberrypi.git ptxdist select configs/ptxconfig ptxdist platform platform-pengutronix-raspberrypi/platformconfig ptxdist toolchain /opt/OSELAS.Toolchain-2011.11.3/arm-1136jfs-linux-gnueabi/gcc-4.6.2-glibc-2.14.1-binutils-2.21.1a-kernel-2.6.39-sanitized/bin ptxdist --force go ptxdist --force images # #    SD  # sudo dd if=./platform-pengutronix-raspberrypi/images/hd.img of=/dev/mmcblk0</span></span></code> </pre><br><br><h6>  Errors </h6><br><ul><li>  <code>configure: error: cannot compute suffix of object files: cannot compile</code> .

The first is an excellent development of OpenEmbedded, but technically nothing new, the second project I just wanted to try. <br><br>  For myself, I chose to try the BuildRoot and, if something does not suit me, I will switch to the Yocto project (instead of the OpenEmbedded). <br><br>  And of course, you do not need to collect your distributions (or images), if you can try it already ready, it will be much easier.  On each site from the assembly systems there are already ready images. <br><br>  My little research came to an end and, as a result, decided to include it in this article. <br><br><h5>  What missed </h5><br><ul><li>  Did not write a list of packages that the build system provides </li><li>  Are there any commands to immediately generate a configuration for working through nfs (only for convenience) </li><li>  I did not specify the size of the resulting image, the time of its assembly and the total size of the folder, after compilation </li></ul><br><h5>  Material for further research </h5><br><ul><li>  <a href="http://www.intestinate.com/pilfs/">PiLFS</a> - there is an example of how to compile Quake 3 at RPi itself </li><li>  <a href="http://www.jayway.com/2013/01/20/linux-from-scratch-on-raspberry-pi/">CLFS RPi assembly</a> instructions </li><li>  <a href="http://elinux.org/RPi_Distributions">A large list of images</a> under RPi </li></ul><br><h5>  The last word </h5><br>  If you find a mistake, please let me know - I will correct it. <br>  If you wish, I will add links to the images I got. <br>  If you have comments, comments, some text seems too simple and not necessary, please write in person. <br>  Added screenshots. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/172349/">https://habr.com/ru/post/172349/</a></p>
