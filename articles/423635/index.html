  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Retro style audiobook player</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Autumn has come again.  And with it came the gray sky, rainy weather and autumn blues.  In this weather, I want to kindle a fireplace, get on a chair with my legs, wrap myself up in a warm blanket and slowly sip hot tea, listen to some radio play, like in childhood.  It would seem that with the modern development of technology with listening to performances or audio books there are no problems - we are surrounded by many devices that can reproduce sound.  These are computers, phones, mp3-players.  But the problem is that this sound is different from the one that old radio receivers, receivers or players were making.  So you need to make a player that will sound ‚Äúlike in childhood‚Äù.  And look appropriate. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ot/r5/k8/otr5k8fgzcxx8fuj5tbo2uo77jy.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Who cares, welcome under cat. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  In order to get sound from the past, we need a speaker from the past.  In my case, it turned out to be 4GD-35.  The speaker has a high quality factor and therefore is intended for installation in open enclosures.  This must be considered when designing the device.

      As a player I will use a motherboard based on the GPD2856C chip.  This board has a low cost (~ $ 1 for 2 pieces) built-in 2W amplifier and sufficient functionality for playing MP3 files from MicroSD cards.  A power supply from an old cell phone was found as a power source.  There were also a few clock buttons, a power button and some wires.  It all came together in a simple scheme. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/4e/jp/oj/4ejpojfcpnyjeheztbhexuujeg8.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Collected, tested (with Chinese components without this in any way), thought about the case.  In the presence of a 3D printer, meditations were more of a philosophical focus ‚Äî in what style it should be made and how to make a front panel for a speaker with a diameter of 20.5 cm on a printer with a 20x20 cm field without gluing this panel into separate parts.  The body decided to do in the style of old radio outlets.  Speakers speaker parts covered corners.  Modeled in CAD "Compass 3D".  First created dimensional models of the main elements. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ga/x7/le/gax7lejduj1wd_aqxumjyq7akje.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Then he created the hull parts directly and assembled them. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/qd/cu/zu/qdcuzuyx0kqqv9zaielicansiy8.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Then I got a little bit blinid, because I didn‚Äôt make the model of the speaker itself, but more on that below.  The resulting model sent to print.  Printed on the printer Picaso Designer.  Used 2 plastics: red PET-G, manufactured by ABS-Maker and brown ABS, manufactured by Picaso.  In all cases, a nozzle with a diameter of 0.3 mm was used, the seal was a layer of 0.2 mm. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/cn/hv/vh/cnhvvhol-wy8aa0akh-9uyccsz8.png" alt="image"><br><br>  As the printing of parts began to collect and try on them to each other. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/hz/vj/c8/hzvjc8y4i-1k7titcwzelu_fz1u.png" alt="image"><br><br>  And it turned out that the wings of the speaker crashed into the side supports. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/fc/7u/2z/fc7u2zj94hpyw_ww8v5guxfvk1m.png" alt="image"><br><br>  The supports were re-modeled and reprinted. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/yp/sm/yc/ypsmyc7jzho1w7gmstfg1x1tm5e.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Buttons made "talking", with their form indicating the action that will occur when pressed.  This made it possible not to make unnecessary inscriptions on the body. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/je/vu/bd/jevubdkd1ixhbqsyd86aix15u4o.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Electronics fastened with hot melt glue. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ez/e6/bh/eze6bh0x9wxi1xxlucg-peqpsjk.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Grill made of acoustic fabric, remaining after the waist grills large speakers.  Behind the fabric he pressed down the grille, in the form of a repeating grille of the front panel and, like the electronics, fixed it with hot glue. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ll/bm/ff/llbmffd8fftfnxdlg1qxtx4tyc8.png" alt="image"><br><br>  The final touch is the installation of the rear wall. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ro/0e/cc/ro0eccmifo6kufq8nommlrtc70a.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Then made a test inclusion. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QWcuN8Qo2IA" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  By sound, the player fully met the expectations placed on it.  The speech is perfectly emphasized, while the sounds of background music (if they exist) go to the background.  Exactly what I expected from this project.  In appearance, it fits perfectly into the interior of the apartment, as indeed it was intended. <br><br>  I will be glad to your questions and comments. <br><br>  Sincerely, Maxim. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/423635/">https://habr.com/ru/post/423635/</a></p>
