Cool when there is plenty to choose from.  In this case, you have two problems. <br><br>  Firstly, among the ‚Äúcatchy‚Äù headlines, only a small part is suitable for landing pages.  To collect clicks on posts in a blog, social networks or a newsletter is one thing; selling a study of a landing page is a completely different story. <br>  Secondly, universal models do not take into account the peculiarities of a specific audience - each user has his own motives to buy a product.

      In this article, we analyze 3 schemes for creating not just headers, but value propositions for paid traffic + how to sharpen them for individual user segments.  On the example of Internet discounter auto parts, a wedding agency and a company selling heating systems. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  To begin with an error that we see in 90% of our clients: the landing page header repeats the key request.  The principle works fine at the ad level, and then the fantasy of the directors ends) <br><br>  Today my attention was attracted by such a teaser for VKontakte: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/6b0/b26/038/6b0b26038f484764a2f00806aa44d4a4.jpg"><br><br>  Agree strong offer.  Click at least for the sake of curiosity.  They are in Direct: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/5f8/fdb/996/5f8fdb9962cc4f0985cef19c201e3e16.jpg"><br><br>  We land on the service page already without an offer, with a header and Wikipedia-style text: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c3d/6c0/8d3/c3d6c08d3c3a48369dd03aed9a2811d4.jpg"><br><br>  Guys, you decided to open my eyes what is website promotion?  Where is the increase in attendance by 3-5 times and output to the TOP with a 70% guarantee? <br><br>  For interest, "struck" all the positions in the Special Placement on request "Website Promotion".  In 100% of cases, the landing page headings are simply the name of the service.  After appealing ads, it‚Äôs like Don Juan‚Äôs nightmare: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/2a9/302/e57/2a9302e575124f72b3c5048867af779d.jpg"><br><br>  In Yagla, advertisers often ‚Äúsin‚Äù on narrow-targeted requests, when the replaced content stupidly repeats the keyword. <br><br>  For example, an online auto parts discounter.  They diligently copy the name of the part in the title (screenshot from the editor of changes): <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/7f6/fd9/e39/7f6fd9e394d14925a870aab9108b22e1.jpg"><br><br>  As a rule, the effect of such a substitution is zero, and in some cases even reduces conversion compared to the original. <br>  I knowingly allocated phrases with the price.  Users do not just add it to the request, so the offer here will be a different accent.  Let's try to make a value proposition for each option. <br><br>  What interests the authors of the request "Buy a generator of Mercedes"?  A mini-survey of fellow car owners showed that when ordering online, they pay attention to 2 things: the originality of the spare part and payment upon receipt.  This is quite enough to write an offer: <br><br>  <i>"Original generators for Mercedes with a guarantee / Delivery to the regions in 3 days, payment upon receipt"</i> <br><br>  We remove concerns with the help of a guarantee + we add the speed of delivery.  But for the query ‚ÄúGenerator for Mercedes price‚Äù we put the price trigger in the first place: <br><br>  <i>"Generators for Mercedes are 18% cheaper than competitors / Warranty, payment upon receipt"</i> <br><br>  Of course, these are hypotheses that need to be tested.  We usually have 2-3 versions of a value proposition for each need.  In Yagla, you can register and launch into the test several variants of substitutions for a specific request.  The same headlines, for example. <br><br>  So, we get the first formula of the landing pages: <br><br>  <b>Indicate the need (name of the product or service) + Give a solution + Remove the main objection</b> <br><br>  By decision, I mean 1-2 benefit factors - what is important for this user segment, what they pay the main attention to.  In measurable terms - delivery in 3 days, price 18% cheaper, etc. <br><br>  The technique is great for narrowly targeted traffic, when the audience is looking for specific models, parameters, brands. <br><br>  The next case is a wedding agency, where there are several different services and, accordingly, different needs of the audience.  This is the organization of the wedding on a turnkey basis, the search for the leader and the place for the celebration.  Initially, they also made the page header match the 1: 1 key request: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/13f/fe4/43c/13ffe443c07147ce87fa7848a6a1842c.jpg"><br><br>  In the left part - search phrases, in the right - headlines.  On average, the project with substitutions conversion collapsed by 18.7% compared with the original.  We recommended rewriting offers using the 4U method.  At the same time all the keywords were grouped under the types of needs.  The task of the title is not to ‚Äúscare‚Äù requests, but to give value. <br><br>  For example, under the query group ‚ÄúHold a Wedding‚Äù, ‚ÄúOrganization of a Wedding‚Äù, ‚ÄúWedding Agency‚Äù our hypothesis is that the user wants to hold a wedding ‚Äúwithout problems‚Äù, with a minimum of effort.  Heading / Subtitle: <br><br>  <i>‚ÄúForget about the problems with organizing a wedding / Let's prepare a holiday in 2 weeks, from the toastmaster and place to the wedding car‚Äù</i> <br><br>  And under the query group "Cafe for a wedding", "Where to hold a wedding", "Restaurant for a wedding" we offer to choose a place for any budget: <br><br>  <i>‚ÄúLet's pick up a place for a wedding on any budget in 3 days / If you order a wedding cake as a gift before June 1‚Äù</i> <br><br>  Here‚Äôs what it looks like in the Yagla substitution editor: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d49/b01/4fc/d49b014fc31f4099b66545accee6abf6.jpg"><br><br>  Formula 4U is: <br><br>  - <b>Utility</b> (customer benefit).  In our case - "Forget about the problems ...", "We will find a place ..."; <br><br>  - <b>Uniqueness</b> - at the expense of which the client will benefit, some sort of trick to detuning from competitors - ‚ÄúPrepare a holiday from the toastmaster to the wedding car‚Äù, ‚ÄúPlace on any budget‚Äù; <br><br>  - <b>Ultraspecificity</b> - use in measurable units - ‚ÄúFor 2 weeks‚Äù, ‚ÄúFor 3 days‚Äù; <br><br>  - <b>Urgency</b> - time limit, not required element.  For the second group, this is the subtitle ‚ÄúWhen ordering a wedding cake as a gift before June 1‚Äù. <br><br>  Headings 4U are often long and ugly, while they are best, in my opinion, show specific benefits for a specific user need. <br><br>  Cool, if you can add to the benefits of emotions.  They even work in harsh niches: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/0ad/f65/386/0adf653865a94786b4348056d7715386.jpg"><br><br>  For more information on the secrets of mechanics, see the article <b><a href="https://megamozg.ru/company/yagla/blog/22324/">‚ÄúHeaders by the 4U method: 30 examples‚Äù</a></b> . <br><br>  And one more scheme on the example of a company selling heating systems - <b>‚ÄúBenefit + Benefit‚Äù</b> . <br><br>  In fact, this is a simplified combination of the first techniques, as follows: <b>The subject of advertising + benefit + benefit</b> . <br><br>  Some of my colleagues advise you to add an adjective to the advertisement object (professional, reliable, high-quality, fast, etc.) I consider this a dubious method, since each person has his own measure of quality, reliability, speed.  Why add to the offer that is not specific? <br><br>  So, a few examples of headings for heating systems. <br><br>  Under the requests "Heat in the country", "Heating a private house", "Put heating in the country" hypothesis - the middle class and below, a limited budget, tight deadlines. <br><br>  Title: <br><br>  <i>"Installation of heating systems in private homes for 3 days / Budget savings of up to 30%"</i> <br><br>  We do not have a clear criterion for the requests ‚ÄúHeating systems‚Äù, ‚ÄúAutonomous heating‚Äù, ‚ÄúHot water supply‚Äù.  It can be homeowners, and owners of retail space, and representatives of the HOA.  We make universal accents on the guarantee and quick calculation of the project: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b40/b8d/b4a/b40b8db4a2bd451b935dcb31cd75cc9c.jpg"><br><br>  In our practice, it is these three schemes that give the most conversions. <br><br>  Once again, the key parameters are taken not from the head, but after a deep study of the target audience.  What it really "clings", what are the benefits and advantages. <br><br>  And in conclusion, this is the message: <br><br><blockquote>  The lower the value segment made, the higher the conversion to the target action. </blockquote><br><br>  PS Share in the comments what approaches work in your advertising campaigns. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f61/a78/71b/f61a7871b52f4e88b79cc1b9b86cc1ab.jpg">  The author of the material is Alexander Alimov, the founder of YAGLA.ru, an expert in the field of traffic hypersegmentation. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/300268/">https://habr.com/ru/post/300268/</a></p>
