  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Architecture Standards for Internet of Things</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The other day I needed information about which IoT architecture is typical (reference).  Such information could not be quickly found either on the ‚ÄúHabr√©‚Äù or on other resources.  It turned out that the first attempts to develop standards in this direction were made only two years ago, and the work is still in the ‚Äúproject‚Äù stage.  In this article you will find a ‚Äúslice‚Äù of the state of development of IEEE &amp; ISO / IEC standards according to the description of the IoT Reference Architecture (IoT Reference Architecture). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/299/763/22c/29976322c91d48f39a6f904948e27a23.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <a href="http://www.computerra.ru/">A source</a> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h3>  Why do we need standards? </h3><br>  Let's start with the <s>holivarial</s> ambiguous topic of standardization. <br>  World technical progress is moving in the following direction: when technology becomes mature enough, it is time to standardize it, which is a step towards the so-called "open systems" with typical components and interfaces.  If we consider the well-known <a href="https://www.gartner.com/doc/3098434">Gartner Hype Cycle</a> , then standardization can be carried out proactively, long before the technology is ready for mass implementation. <br><br>  The whole world of technical (and not only) products is defined by standards, and without it all of us would be covered with chaos.

      As for IoT, the use of standards is also an important platform when working with large government and corporate customers, including in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãsafety-critical applications (safety critical, security critical, mission critical, etc.). <br>  "Glorifying" standardization can not be said about the "dark side of power", which, in my opinion, includes: <br><br>  - the existence of an excess of standards, the lack of a clear system, the presence of different organizations involved in standardization in the same sphere; <br>  - incomplete and uneven coverage of standardization objects; <br>  - ‚Äúwar of standards‚Äù, i.e.  lobbying the interests of individual firms to the detriment of solving common problems of standardization; <br>  - regulation mainly only the most simple objects and mass processes; <br>  - a bureaucratic procedure and a long development of standards (on average, three to five years), which leads to their conservatism and the backlog of practical needs. <br>  Nevertheless, the world of standards exists, and we live in it. <br><br><h3>  IEEE vs ISO / IEC </h3><br>  Those who are faced with the world of standards, knows that in the field of IT this world is bipolar, because there are two generally recognized organizations: IEEE (Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers) and IEC (International Electrotechnical Commission - IEC). <br>  In different areas of standardization, the mutual influence of IEEE and IEC is different, but ‚Äúon average‚Äù (there are exceptions), America loves IEEE, and Europe loves IEC. <br><br>  In some areas, IEC collaborates with ISO, for example, the ISO / IEC JTC1 (Joint Technical Committee in International and Communication Technology) deals with the IoT area of ‚Äã‚Äãinterest to us. <br><br>  There are, of course, other international standards organizations, for example, CENELEC, which develops EN (European Normative), ITU-T (International Telecommunication Union Telecommunication Standardization Sector), American NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology) and many others. <br><br><h3>  What does IEEE do in the field of IoT </h3><br>  IoT fell within the scope of IEEE and ISO / IEC JTC1 almost simultaneously.  In July 2014, the <a href="http://grouper.ieee.org/groups/2413/">IEEE P2413</a> Working Group was created and the first rally was held to develop the Standard for the Internet of Things (IoT) Standard.  The working group included representatives from Cisco, Emerson, Hitachi, Honeywell, Huawei, Intel, Kaspersky Lab, Rockwell Automation, Schneider Electric, Siemens, STMicroelectronics, Toshiba, Yokogawa, and others.  Microsoft and Google were not noticed. <br><br>  In 2014-2016  rallies are held 4 times a year.  Detailed information on the development status on the group website is not given, there are only high-level presentations. <br><br>  An interesting fact is the attentive attitude of the <a href="http://grouper.ieee.org/groups/2413/">IEEE P2413</a> working group to the issues of ensuring reliability and security (Dependability &amp; Security). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/614/8da/4af/6148da4af46f4b47b5121c76ccb6a3b2.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <a href="http://grouper.ieee.org/groups/2413/">A source</a> <br><br>  Therefore, IoT is planned for use in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãalready mentioned systems important to safety (safety critical, security critical, mission critical, etc.).  This is also confirmed by the participation in the development of the standard "monsters" of industrial automation. <br><br><h3>  What does ISO / IEC JTC1 do in the field of IoT? </h3><br>  The decision to create the Working Group on Internet of Things (WG10) working group was taken at the <a href="http://www.iso.org/iso/jtc1_home.html">ISO / IEC JTC1</a> plenary rally in 2014.  In January 2015, the first WG10 rally was held, at which it was decided to develop the ISO / IEC 30141 standard ‚ÄúInternet of Things Reference Architecture (IoT-RA)‚Äù, since then similar meetings are held three times a year.  The <a href="http://www.iso.org/iso/jtc1_home.html">ISO / IEC JTC1</a> page contains an initial report on the state of affairs in the field of IoT (Study Report on IoT Reference Architectures / Frameworks) and some of the results from ‚ÄúWG10 on IoT‚Äù.  Let's stop on the mentioned report <br>  What can be understood from scarce facts? <br><br>  First, many of the provisions of the future IoT-RA standard are borrowed from related already standardized areas, such as: <br><br>  - home electronic systems (Home Electronic Systems, described in the ISO / IEC 14543 series of standards); <br>  - MPEG-V architecture for media management (Media context and control, described in ISO / IEC 23005 series standards); <br>  - Sensor Network Reference Architecture (SNRA, described in ISO / IEC 29182 series of standards). <br>  Regarding the latter architecture, it should be noted that it was she who was the standardized prototype of the IoT architecture, proposing four typical levels: device, network, service, and application. <br><br>  Secondly, the architecture description for IoT will be adapted from the existing ITU-T standards ((International Telecommunication Union Telecommunication Standardization Sector) since 2012, in particular ITU-T Y.2060 ‚ÄúOverview of the Internet of things‚Äù. <br><br>  Relevant levels of architecture and the relationship between them (the so-called "ecosystem") are listed below. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/8fc/5cc/eb3/8fc5cceb3b1e4dd0918adee190fa3a0f.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f45/103/094/f45103094ee248359bedd4fe9d2ef74c.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <a href="http://www.iso.org/iso/jtc1_home.html">A source</a> <br><br>  Thirdly, the developed requirements for IoT components will be structured according to the taxonomy proposed in ITU-T Y.2066 ‚ÄúCommon requirements of the Internet of things‚Äù, which includes the following groups of requirements: <br><br>  - Implementation and operability requirements; <br>  - Non-functional requirements <br>  - Application support requirements; <br>  - Service requirements; <br>  - Communication requirements; <br>  - Device requirements; <br>  - Data management requirements; <br>  - Security and privacy protection requirements. <br><br><h3>  Conclusion </h3><br>  In the near future, the release of standards describing the Reference Architecture for IoT is expected.  This fact will further approximate IoT to ‚Äúopen systems‚Äù with typical compatible components and interfaces. <br><br>  Since 2014, the development of such standards has been conducted in parallel with the <a href="http://grouper.ieee.org/groups/2413/">IEEE Working Group P2413</a> and the <a href="http://www.iso.org/iso/jtc1_home.html">ISO / IEC ‚ÄúWorking Group on the Internet of Things (WG10)‚Äù</a> .  Having two standards will add headaches to component suppliers and system integrators. <br><br>  Open information about these developments is available a little.  It is obvious that existing developments will be standardized, in particular, from <a href="http://www.itu.int/en/ITU-T/Pages/default.aspx">ITU-T</a> , according to which the reference architecture includes four typical levels: device layer, network layer, service layer, and application layer. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/307668/">https://habr.com/ru/post/307668/</a></p>
