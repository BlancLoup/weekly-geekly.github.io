Fortunately, Linux and open source software are easily accessible.  However, if you are a new user, you may not know which utilities are best for you to choose, so here are 10 outstanding tools that will help elevate your development to another level. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  1. Bluefish </h4><br><br>  <a href="http://bluefish.openoffice.nl/">Bluefish</a> is one of the most popular integrated development environments available for working on the web.  Bluefish can handle programming and markup languages, but focuses on creating dynamic and interactive websites.  Like many Linux applications, Bluefish is fast and easy ‚Äî it uses about 30‚Äì40 percent of the resources consumed by similar applications.

      Bluefish can open several documents at the same time: up to 3 500 documents, if necessary.  It includes project support, remote file support, search and replace (including regular expressions), unlimited cancellation / acceptance of changes made, custom syntax highlighting for many languages, text smoothing in windows, and support for various encodings. <br><br>  One of the best features of Bluefish is the Quickbar, a custom panel that allows you to add buttons by right-clicking and selecting the <i>Add To Quickbar option</i> .  You can add any HTML button to the Quickbar. <br><br>  Bluefish has a number of simple tools that will help you add various elements to your code.  Need auto-submit select box in DHTML?  Easy.  Select ‚ÄúAuto-submit Select Box‚Äù from the ‚ÄúDHTML‚Äù drop-down list and fill in the necessary items to add an element to your code.  Bluefish has wizards for C, Apache, DHTML, DocBook, HTML, PHP + HTML and SQL.  If you are developing your sites manually, then you will not do without Bluefish. <br><br><h4>  2. Anjuta </h4><br><br>  <a href="http://projects.gnome.org/anjuta/">Anjuta</a> is a free open source integrated development environment for C and C ++.  Anjuta is powerful and easy to install (for example, the command <code>urpmi anjuta</code> in Mandriva Linux).  Anjuta offers features such as project management, application wizards, an interactive debugger, and a powerful source code editor ‚Äî with code review, auto-completion, and syntax highlighting. <br><br>  Anjuta has a flexible user interface that allows you to drag (drag-and-drop) tools into a set of tools for organizing the user interface into an option that you like best.  Plus, each user-hosted toolbox is permanent for a project, so you can have different toolboxes for each project. <br><br>  Anjuta also has a powerful plugin system that allows you to decide for each project which plugins are active and which are not.  And, as in all open source projects, you can develop your own plugins for Anjuta. <br><br>  One of the most powerful tools in Anjuta is the project manager.  He not only can open almost all projects based on Automake and Autoconf;  it does not add any information related to Anjuta, so your project can also be maintained and developed outside of Anjuta. <br><br><h4>  3. Glade </h4><br><br>  <a href="http://glade.gnome.org/">Glade</a> is a RAD tool used to create <a href="http://www.gtk.org/">GTK +</a> tools and for the <a href="http://www.gnome.org/">GNOME</a> desktop <a href="http://www.gnome.org/">environment</a> .  Its interface is similar to <a href="http://www.gimp.org/">GIMP</a> and can be customized and even built into Anjuta. <br><br>  Glade includes a number of templates, such as text blocks, dialogs, checkboxes, and menus, created to speed up the design of interfaces.  Interface constructs are stored in XML, which allows them to be easily associated with external tools. <br><br>  Installing Glade is simple.  For example, in Fedora, you can run the command <code>yum install glade3</code> .  Glade does not have such a powerful project manager as Anjuta, but you can create, edit and save projects with Glade. <br><br><h4>  4. GCC </h4><br><br>  <a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/">GCC</a> is a set of compilers for C, C ++, Objective-C, Fortran, Java, and Ada, developed as part of the GNU project.  It is a command line tool, but it is very powerful.  Many integrated development environments have tools that are just the front-ends for GCC.  The most commonly used compilers for C and C ++ code. <br><br>  How does one tool compile applications in different languages?  Simply: for C you use the gcc command, and for C ++ you use the g ++ command - two compilers in the same toolkit.  And g ++ is a compiler, not just a preprocessor. <br><br>  GCC will build the object code from source code without using an intermediary.  This method creates better object code and gives you more debug information. <br><br><h4>  5. Kdevelop </h4><br><br>  <a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/">Kdevelop</a> was created in 1998 as an easy-to-use integrated development environment for the <a href="http://www.kde.org/">KDE</a> desktop <a href="http://www.kde.org/">environment</a> .  Kdevelop is currently licensed under the GNU General Public License and is free to use. <br><br>  It is based on plugins, so you can add and remove them to create exactly what you want.  Kdevelop also includes profile support, so different sets of plug-ins can be associated with specific projects. <br><br>  Kdevelop supports 15 programming languages, each of which has its own language features.  It also offers a debugger, Subversion version control system, application wizards, documentation viewer, snippet management, Doxygen integration, RAD tools, Ctags support, code reformatting, QuickOpen support, and a toolbar window pane. <br><br>  One of the best features of Kdevelop is that it removes many low-level tasks from the hands of users.  Kdevelop includes an Automake manager. <br><br>  Another useful feature is that you can instantly see the difference between errors, warnings and messages. <br><br><h4>  6. GDB </h4><br><br>  <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/gdb/">GDB is</a> not a tool for developers, but many people consider this tool important.  GDB is a GNU project debugger. <br><br>  This tool is run from the command line and gives the developer instant feedback from another program while it is running.  That is, you create and complete the application only to find out that there are problems.  In order to help find these problems, you can run your program from the GDB utility, which will help you know where these problems are.  With GDB, you can do the following: <br><ul><li>  launch your application with arguments, switches or inputs that will affect its behavior; </li><li>  make your application dwell on a specific behavior; </li><li>  check what happened when your application stopped; </li><li>  add changes to your program so that you can test right on the fly. </li></ul><br>  GDB is also very handy to have when reporting bugs. <br><br><h4>  7. KompoZer </h4><br><br>  <a href="http://www.kompozer.net/">KompoZer</a> is an easy-to-use WYSIWYG tool aimed at non-technical users who want to create a professional website without HTML knowledge. <br><br>  KompoZer has a number of outstanding features.  One of the best features is the ability to open a website from a URL, edit this site and download the edited site.  This feature makes it easy to update sites, eliminating the need to edit HTML.  Of course, you will need permission to download the site.  This feature is also good for using other sites as templates. <br><br>  KompoZer should not be considered only as a tool for beginners.  Think of it as a free open-source replacement for Microsoft FrontPage and Adobe Dreamweaver.  And, like its more expensive alternatives, in KompoZer you can navigate between WYSIWYG and editing the code by clicking on a taboo. <br><br><h4>  8. Eclipse </h4><br><br>  <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/">Eclipse</a> is a multilingual integrated development environment written in Java, with an extensive plugin system that allows you to extend the functionality.  Downloading more than a million times a month, Eclipse is one of the strongest software development solutions.  This is, in fact, the standard for open source development. <br><br>  Presumably, the strongest aspect of Eclipse is the plugin feature.  For languages ‚Äã‚Äãonly, Eclipse has 58 plugins.  These languages ‚Äã‚Äãare not spoken - these are development languages.  Eclipse has a huge community and many organizations offering training in integrated development environments, which even includes the University of Eclipse. <br><br><h4>  9. Make </h4><br><br>  <a href="http://www.makelinux.net/make3/">Make</a> is a Linux utility that can automatically determine which parts of a program to recompile.  After Make works in the parts to be recompiled, it issues the commands necessary to complete the action. <br><br>  Make is often used when installing applications from source code, so open source developers should have a good understanding of this tool and how it is used.  If you are planning to develop an application that can be installed from source code, you need to know how to create a Makefile. <br><br>  This Makefile describes the relationship between different files.  If you are familiar with installing applications, you know the <i>./configure</i> string type <i>;</i>  <i>make;</i>  <i>make install</i> . <br><br><h4>  10. Quanta Plus </h4><br><br>  <a href="http://quanta.kdewebdev.org/">Quanta Plus</a> is another HTML development tool similar to KompoZer.  It is capable of both WYSIWYG and manual mode and supports HTML, XHTML, CSS, XML and PHP. <br><br>  Quanta Plus features include tag completion on the fly, project management, quick preview, PHP debugger, support for CVS and Subversion.  Quanta Plus, unlike KompoZer, is aimed at a more experienced user who wants a good WYSIWYG editor. <br><br><h4>  What do you use? </h4><br><br>  What advice and opinions can you give, based on your experience, on the tools we have reviewed?  Or do you have a favorite free integrated development environment that is not included in this list? </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/58706/">https://habr.com/ru/post/58706/</a></p>
