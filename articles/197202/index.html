Today we want to start you to get acquainted with our model range.  And we start with the model OPPO Clover.  We believe that it is this model that is a good solution for all active people who value quality, design, work speed and reasonable price.  And I want to tell you that besides all this, the gadget will suit lovers of high-quality sound, because it has a dedicated DAC.  But first things first, welcome under cat. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f87/549/469/f87549469aaaa2c26008363deabef07e.jpg" alt="image"><a name="habracut"></a><h5>  Appearance, materials, under the cover. </h5><br>  So let's start, as usual, with the appearance.  The design of the smartphone is different from most of the devices on the current market.  In our review, the device is presented in white, so far no other color solution has been presented at the time of writing the review.  The already familiar black frontal part is framed by a white stroke, which has a slight thickening at the bottom with an engraved brand inscription.  In bright sunshine more than once there was a feeling that a certain halo arose around the device, a very unusual feeling, I want to tell you.  The main working area is located in a slightly raised bath.  Inside it is a screen, under it are three touch control buttons (menu, home, back), and on the top: a front camera (1.9 megapixel) and a speaker.  All this is covered with a protective glass Asahi Glass Dragontrail, recommended as an excellent alternative to the same Corning Glass. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ea0/179/c5f/ea0179c5f90f1db6b4316f8fd3b475ee.jpg" alt="image"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f36/312/959/f363129598f11780c331da22b4911c7c.jpg" alt="image">

      <br>
      The side faces of the smartphone are slightly sloping from the front to the back, as a result, the smartphone has the shape of a rounded inverted truncated pyramid and quite successfully, because of this, lies in the hand.  Around there is a bezel made of plastic, but painted for metal.  Pretty good move to add image modelka.  On the right side is a single volume control button, the lock button is located on the left side.  Both ‚Äúlevers‚Äù have a good power reserve and are perfectly located blindly.  Below is a microUSB outlet, a microphone and a small slot for easy opening of the lid.  From above, the 3.5 headphone output is lonely. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/2ce/85e/c02/2ce85ec02b90bf205a0f482112f49eec.jpg" alt="image"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/862/344/d8b/862344d8ba9837d70f49a2f34387e0ee.jpg" alt="image"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/330/e7c/372/330e7c372a1451a0e5bc29143120430e.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The back has a centering arrangement of all elements.  At the bottom is a perforation under the main speakers (there are two of them but more on that later).  In the center along the inscription is OPPO.  If you only knew how many times people took a device from me and misread the name of the company.  At the very top, the camera's eye and LED flash fit.  Both elements are surrounded by metal rings. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d33/72e/0f7/d3372e0f79d50c4d37b0119d48eef591.jpg" alt="image"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/49e/a66/f70/49ea66f705b491d3ec41f6d37b764441.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Body material - matte plastic, resistant to fingerprints.  The smartphone fits perfectly into the style of any person, whether it is an active student or an influential businessman.  No matter who you are, a man or a woman, the device will look good in your hands.  At least I personally conducted an experiment and watched how a person looks with this model.  The clover is well assembled, there is no backlash in the design, the device is not subject to squeaks during everyday use, even though the case itself is collapsible.  The dimensions of our model are 129.6 x 66.7 x 9.8 mm.  With a weight of 141 grams, the smartphone is felt in the hand is by no means fluff, making it clear that in the hand lies a really high-quality copy. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/76a/dae/6c1/76adae6c1386613419627615b6e0b07d.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  By the way, when you remove the cover, you will open a 1700 mAh battery, a slot for a micoSD memory card, the already mentioned stereo speakers and two SIM card slots.  At the same time, one of them is for a standard SIM, the second is for microSIM, so many users do not need to cut their main card, wanting to leave it untouched or for other unknown reasons. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/495/b08/9e1/495b089e117cb9c25c12c8551fe6305b.jpg" alt="image"><h5>  Screen. </h5><br>  The display of the smartphone is made using IPS technology.  When creating the screen, the air gap is minimized, the borders of the screen can be seen, but only slightly tilting the device.  All this, of course, had a positive effect both on the viewing angles and on the richness and brightness of the transmitted image.  In the sun, the picture fades, but not much, taking into account the use of mostly light design, there are no problems with reading information under direct light.  The screen has a diagonal of 4.3 inches as well as a resolution of 800 by 480 pixels.  The last numbers are likely to be surprising, because the high-resolution trend imposes an imprint on the younger models.  But I can say that with normal use, there is no shortage of pixels in the smartphone, but this has reduced the load on the battery well.  In addition, you can not imagine how nice after the small buttons on FullHD smartphones go to a larger interface.  The only drawback that I personally stated for myself is not the best quality when playing youtube videos through the standard application, because, as you know, with this resolution, ‚Äútube‚Äù does not allow setting the resolution higher than 480p, and as such many videos lose quality , especially if they have any font.  I personally notice this when viewing replays from Battlefield 3 or any other toys. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ead/c4b/dd4/eadc4bdd4332ab6618073a9d87ab9f63.jpg" alt="image"><h5>  CPU, memory. </h5><br>  The smartphone, despite its simple positioning, has excellent characteristics.  The main use is the proven MediaTek MT6589, which operates at 1.2 GHz.  The use of 28 nanometer tech-process in the production of single-chip quad-core processor allowed to achieve an excellent ratio of performance / heating / power consumption.  MediaTek is our official partner, so this is not only cooperation in terms of sales / purchases, but also work to improve the performance of each smartphone. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/303/c0b/9e5/303c0b9e515adc575d6eaf54916d7941.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The PowerVR SGX544MP is a video chip, a pretty good solution, giving you the opportunity to enjoy the latest games.  Launched Real Racing 3, for example, works without problems, with maximum graphics settings (rear-view mirrors), but Asphalt 8 has already shown teeth and excellent FPS can be achieved only with medium settings.  Also in the smartphone is installed 1 gigabyte of RAM and 2.5 gigabytes of available internal memory, of course, it can be expanded with a microSD card.  Stable work is guaranteed at 32 GB, but our first users point out excellent work when installing the 64 GB option.  With these features and individual software optimization work with the support of MediaTek, the smartphone has a smooth and fast interface, especially for its price segment. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ebd/2ad/fa8/ebd2adfa8082bf8d739205420d8c7b36.png" alt="image"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/731/80e/b48/73180eb4887f897a0e3a423d387f1475.png" alt="image"><h5>  Sound and music interface. </h5><br>  Actually what Clover was created for.  The main emphasis in the production of the smartphone was made precisely on the musical component.  The ST Microelecronics is a headphone amplifier with the TS 4621 model. The Yamaha YDA 145 acts as an amplifier for speakers. The speakers themselves work in stereo mode and, thanks to the overall curved back cover design, can create surround sound in compositions.  Of course, how can you call a smartphone musical if it does not have a dedicated audio chip?  Engineers installed aboard a DAC: Texas Instruments PCM5101A.  Even in top smartphones you don‚Äôt often see a separate DAC, but here you are welcome. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/835/9c3/1c2/8359c31c2c922db34ddda2d2bfc7bc99.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The sound of OPPO Clover quietly competes in quality and volume of sound volume with the flagships of other major manufacturers.  This applies to both external speakers and sound in headphones.  What can we say about simple models in this price segment. <br>  Laboratory staff DoctorHead.ru conducted tests RMAA and RAA indicating that <blockquote>  ‚ÄúFrom the RAA reports it can be noted that Clover has a more powerful amplifier, more suitable for overhead headphones or headphones with low sensitivity.  Clover‚Äôs signal level is on average twice as high as on most phones. ‚Äù </blockquote><br>  More information about the reports can be found at <a href="http://personalaudio.ru/raa/otchety/usiliteli/oppo-clover-r815/">personalaudio.ru/raa/otchety/usiliteli/oppo-clover-r815</a> <br>  On this we certainly do not stop.  A standard player, in addition to playing Wav, wma and MP3, supports playback of this important for fans of music in FLAC format.  The player itself has three main windows: a playlist, the cover of the current composition (the window is the main one) and the lyrics of the song, if it is available in tags.  Switching between windows is done with a simple swipe, while the playback controls, the selection of the repeat mode and the section of compositions are always available.  Using the ‚Äúmenu‚Äù button, we can quickly set the melody to the call, while it is possible to trim the composition immediately from the application. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/4d0/b4b/989/4d0b4b989db93395a50c51b26f544e75.png" alt="image"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/bb4/523/880/bb452388054f58069a5c331bcfb1f3d3.png" alt="image"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/407/7db/8d2/4077db8d217555995f3a8425238765c1.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Basic settings also give a lot of opportunities.  First - the inclusion of shuffle mode.  Secondly, you can adjust the time to automatically turn off the music, if you like to fall asleep to your favorite motifs.  In addition, there is a choice of design of the player from the three options as well as setting the switching of the music track by shaking.  If you think that this is all there is no.  Below are perhaps the most important points in the player.  Turning on the Dirac mode (it works only in headphones) activates the appropriate sound processing algorithm, which allows you to create the feeling that you are in the first row for the performance of your favorite artist.  This effect is achieved by cleaning the sound from all sorts of noise.  The voice of the performer becomes crystal clear.  For lovers of manual settings, you can switch to Dolby Mobile mode, where you can customize the environment, as well as edit the equalizer parameters with standard presets, or with the help of a seven-way knob. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b03/10f/843/b0310f8438efa295ce8fc1e2ad09d30f.png" alt="image"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/1f9/c11/e31/1f9c11e31c603c4d2d247933dddc037b.png" alt="image"><br><br>  If you think that music lovers can calm down on this, then do not expect.  Firstly, a full-screen skeuomorphic widget in the form of a record player is installed as the last desktop.  Moving the head turns on / off playback.  Swipe up down the plate - switching tracks.  When you connect headphones, if at the moment there is no sound through some kind of application (youtube, games, etc.), the smartphone will unlock and automatically transfer you to this screen.  The standard lock screen is also made in gram style.  plates in the case.  If you hold the ‚Äúhouse‚Äù button for a long time, you can also hide / show the player control buttons on it. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/674/054/987/674054987338e9b2b64dc6451520ee2d.png" alt="image"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/273/f5c/c99/273f5cc9982f3420a1dadd62cec1c38d.png" alt="image"><h5>  Work with 2 sim cards. </h5><br>  Another feature of the model is working with two SIM cards.  One slot is made under the standard SIM, the second - under the microSIM.  Hot-swappable chips without turning off the smartphone, alas, is not provided.  In the smartphone only one radio module.  On the possibilities of the shell, we have already told in a separate post.  In short, working with 2 sim cards has not yet been so convenient. <br><br><h5>  Software.  Soft </h5><br>  At the time of the start of sales, the smartphone is based on version 4.2.1 android.  I understand, everyone wants to see version 4.3 and higher, we are considering the possibility of updating, and as the information will be, we will be happy to share with you about it.  However, I can say that your own shell will be even more interesting than the capabilities of the latest version of Android.  With features and features you can find in <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/oppo/blog/193050/">this post</a> . <br>  It also became known that our work on ColorOS (which we will talk about, of course, with you later) with more than 400 changes in comparison with pure android will also be available for Clover. <br><br><h5>  Camera. </h5><br>  Smartphone has a rear camera with a 5 megapixel LED flash and a 1.9 megapixel front camera.  Both cameras shoot HD video.  The basic settings of the camera are eliminated, instead there is a clearer and more convenient choice of shooting modes. <br>  Separately, you can mention the Beauty Plus mode, which ‚Äúcleans‚Äù the faces in the photos, making them more suitable for any glossy magazine. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f66/1a4/3fc/f661a43fc096042035e13a00eaa68c86.png" alt="image"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/503/281/2c5/5032812c512681c58beeeca2fc11b1b7.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Smile mode creates a series of shots, among which you can choose the most suitable face of each person present in the picture. <br>  If the shooting button is held for a long time, the Burst mode starts, allowing you to take 100 shots in 15 seconds. <br>  The transition to the gallery is carried out with a simple swipe on the bottom of the screen in a vertical position. <br>  Removes the device quite confidently and can create good pictures in conditions of sufficient lighting, at least my transition from the Galaxy Nexus gave an increased quality of pictures. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b59/6d8/fcb/b596d8fcb1f581a45990b82a000bfeb4.jpg" alt="image"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/50b/a03/4bf/50ba034bf6b4e920d2b4e8a215d55ddb.jpg" alt="image"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/bf7/a63/047/bf7a63047a7fc61cca65d4b9225d11ca.jpg" alt="image"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/1a1/cbd/5fc/1a1cbd5fc8d3d35a055cae36c64c001d.jpg" alt="image"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a28/059/251/a2805925117a5274e733838eaaacb422.jpg" alt="image"><h5>  Equipment </h5><br>  Included is the R815 smartphone, charger, battery, headset.  The smartphone originally comes with a factory matte film, which not everyone will even shoot. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a5c/aa6/a04/a5caa6a04b592b5a6642d3f41b2a9b95.jpg" alt="image"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/748/25a/9d8/74825a9d85897776bd9dfdefb9510c00.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  In the end, of course, talking about the price.  OPPO Clover <a href="http://oppo.ru/catalog/smartphones/smartfon-oppo-clover-r815.html">in our company shop</a> costs 10990 rubles.  When buying, as a gift you get a protective case with one of four colors to choose from and a protective film.  As noted earlier, Clover is a targeted choice of a person for whom the musical component is important.  However, in everyday use, the smartphone will perfectly fit into your range of tasks.  Thank you for your attention, stay with us. <br><br>  PS A bunch of different images in the original can be found <a href="http://fotki.yandex.ru/users/sgrebenschikov/album/368951/">here.</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/197202/">https://habr.com/ru/post/197202/</a></p>
