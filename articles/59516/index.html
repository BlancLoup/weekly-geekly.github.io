  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Help school sites</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  <i>The author of this topic is a new (well, almost new :)) user <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/users/elm/" class="user_link">Elm</a></i> <br><br>  I work as a methodologist in the St. Petersburg city center for informatization of education.  Teaching teachers how to use IT in their activities (if briefly).  One of the areas of work are school sites.  For a long time on this topic, 2 years ago, a <a href="http://shop.direktor.ru/product_info.php%3Fproducts_id%3D181">book was written</a> with a colleague, I was promoting the ‚Äú <a href="http://edusite.ru/">Designer of school sites</a> ‚Äù in St. Petersburg. <br><br>  Now we held the <a href="http://inform-center.spb.ru/method/activity/sitefest/">first city festival of sites "Open School"</a> .  Each of the 18 St. Petersburg districts presented the best (in their opinion) school sites.  They selected scientific and methodological centers, not schools, but still, against the general background, almost all the sites were pretty decent.  We, the organizing committee, were also interested in analyzing the sites - it is important to know what is happening in this area in the city. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Now about where the schools come from sites.  There is no official provision on the Shelter‚Äôs site regulating the content of the official site in the city.  Bets in the school for this is not provided - since  Our bosses are not an easy activity and nobody needs to pay anything here.  On the other hand, there is a semi-official (it‚Äôs distributed in all districts, but there are no documents) the requirement ‚Äúthere was a site‚Äù.  Naturally, at the expense of internal reserves and at what time from the work you want.  There are schools with informatics enthusiasts who drag this hump on themselves (this is not primarily about technology, but about content support).  In other schools around the site work adult-child teams and project activities are organized.  In the third local acts on school are made out and people are bent on doing something.  In general, a normal mess.

      In such a situation, we did not hold contests with the definition of ‚Äúbest-worst‚Äù; we made a festival - in order to see for ourselves and show people what is done on this front.  For altruism, people still have to say how many points they scored and what they lost - somehow this is wrong.  You just need to support their initiative. <br><br>  Judging by the results of the work of the jury, the school is able to create a very average website.  Such errors occur regularly, which show that even entry-level presentations often do not exist.  Swear?  No, you need to raise people.  We need to somehow combine these school sites, create an environment for sharing experiences.  Therefore‚Ä¶ <br><br>  In the fall, we want to create an "Association of St. Petersburg School Sites" (ASS).  The goal, I repeat: to assist the creators of the educational sites of the city - in technology, design, usability.  Identify findings on school sites, fix them, discuss.  The association is non-profit, i.e.  no one takes money from school.  Moreover, I am convinced that for us it will be an altruistic activity - it is not enough to beat out money from the officials for this (it‚Äôs not a megavage USE, but some websites).  But this must be done: firstly, to support people, and secondly, to somehow raise the level of school sites by teaching the authors. <br><br>  I can describe the detailed content of the school activity in another post in more detail.  If there are questions ‚ÄúWhy does the school have a website at all?‚Äù, ‚ÄúDo people need education outside the school so that the school has a competent website?‚Äù I can also write.  Now appeal. <br><br>  <b>If you are a web designer, programmer, usability, if you work with web content and can correctly evaluate and help correct errors, we ask for help.</b> <br><br>  First of all, I would like to find professional people who could appreciate and, if possible, help schools in website building.  For this, the section ‚ÄúRate me!‚Äù Will be made on the ASHS website: the school gives the address, and competent people leave their comments, giving the school some reasons for reflection.  In general, " <a href="http://www.artlebedev.ru/kovodstvo/business-lynch/">Business Lynch</a> ", but gentle and without a mat. <br>  Secondly, as an option - the section "Workshop" - where the school could leave a request to help in solving a technical problem ("If you would like to fasten this, help to do it!").  And willing experts on a voluntary basis could respond. <br><br>  Knocking on the endless doors of officials with such requests is useless.  It is also quite difficult to search for people in the education system itself - as experience shows, the professional level of educational IT people and specialists working on commercial projects is incomparable (the latter are a lot cooler). <br><br>  There are no pitfalls in this project, I don‚Äôt need it (moreover, there are a lot of hemorrhoids and zero money). <br>  Just want to support people and do the right thing. <br><br>  It is clear that while this is a cat in a bag and no one can give any obligations here at all.  But if potentially you could be of help, leave a short description in the comments with whom you know how to work on the web. <br><br>  PS School site is not a school problem.  This is in many ways a problem for parents who want to know what an organization lives with, where their children spend 10 years of their lives.  Look at <a href="http://likt590.ru/">http://likt590.ru</a> , <a href="http://610.ru/">http://610.ru</a> , <a href="http://2spbg.ru/">http://2spbg.ru</a> , <a href="http://sh336.narod.ru/">http://sh336.narod.ru/</a> .  Would you like your school to have such a site?  Help people. <br><br>  <b>UPD:</b> Thanks for the karma, transferred to the thematic blog. <br><br>  <b>UPD2:</b> Thanks to everyone who responded ( <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/users/reinvigorate/" class="user_link">reinvigorate</a> , <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/users/fog/" class="user_link">fog</a> ) with the invitation invite.  Do not believe it - in the process of searching for a free nickname for registration, Yuri discovered his account ( <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/users/elm/" class="user_link">Elm</a> ), registered as far back in March of the distant 2007th :))) <br><br>  <b>UPD3:</b> No more need, please raise my karma for this post.  If you want to thank, thank the author - the user <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/users/elm/" class="user_link">Elm</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/59516/">https://habr.com/ru/post/59516/</a></p>
