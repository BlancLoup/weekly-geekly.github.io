  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Mac OS and NTFS: the problem and its best solution</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Rumor has it that if you ever run into an Apple computer and a Mac OS, then you won't want to go back to Windows anymore.  And all the ‚Äúcreativity‚Äù of Microsoft after ‚Äútouching the beautiful‚Äù will instantly begin to be perceived with a fair amount of skepticism (except, perhaps, the mice that the Steve Balmer Corporation Satia Nadella is a miracle as good).  True or not, we don‚Äôt try to judge: someone is closer to Mac OS, someone is Windows.  But the fact is that Mac OS users often have to deal with "aliens" from the world of Windows, and nothing can be done about it.  What is meant by aliens?  Yes, a lot of things, if very very frankly.  But now we will talk about such a "vindomonstra", as the native Windows file system - NTFS.  Or rather, about drives formatted in this file system.  Alas, to work with them fully on computers running Mac OS is unrealistic by default - Apple's operating system only supports reading data from such drives, but writing information to them is, alas, oh. <br><br> <a href="http://geektimes.ru/company/paragon/blog/248156/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/57c/41e/1ce/57c41e1cec664f148e2511102ffdaffd.png"></a> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  In practice, this leads to problems with external hard drives.  For example, if a Windows user gives you a hard drive with a certain array of data, then you can only view them, but you can no longer change (delete, edit, add a file).  Well, if a friend - a Windows fan handed you a hard drive with some movie and a strong recommendation to watch it;  You can start the movie directly from a disk connected to Mac and not run into the NFTS problem.  But what if it is vital to write something to someone else's hard drive with NTFS, without resorting to formatting?  For example, a client asked to throw your video presentation onto his screw (or a large volume vector layout, or anything else), and a multi-million contract depends on it? <br><br>  It is worth emphasizing that it may even be not a hard disk at all, but a USB flash drive.  More recently, most of these drives have been formatted in FAT32, with which Mac OS and Windows work equally well.  However, modern flash drives increasingly come with NTFS.  Because FAT32 has a file size limit: it cannot be more than 4 GB, so the film in really high quality cannot be recorded on it, and USB flash drive manufacturers understand this very well.  So they format them in NTFS.  So the difficulties for users of Apple computers may arise with drives of this kind ...

      There are several methods of ‚Äúlearning‚Äù Mac OS for working with NTFS.  For example, you can try to edit the <b>fstab file</b> on Mac OS, however, it is not recommended to do this: the consequences can be unpredictable, even computer malfunction.  To solve the problem considered in this material, there are both free utilities and paid ones.  The overwhelming majority of ‚Äúgratuitous‚Äù options (SLNTFS, NTFS-3G, and others), however, have one major drawback: they do not provide adequate speed.  Roughly speaking, you can write something to NTFS-formatted drives, however, at a snail's pace.  Whether to contact such decisions is an open question. <br><br>  In my opinion, where it is more logical to pay, the benefit of the ‚Äúhigh-speed‚Äù driver is not so expensive.  A kind of reference solution in this area is <b><a href="http://www.paragon.ru/home/ntfs-mac/">Paragon NTFS for Mac 12</a></b> for 990 rubles.  What are the advantages of this option? <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/701/7da/a69/7017daa694304ef193f9b1e1779a51d1.png"><br>  First, just in speed.  The developers guarantee that this is the only product on the market that provides full access to NTFS files (read / write) at the same speed as the Mac OS native driver for files in HFS +, its native system.  For comparison: a free solution takes about 10 minutes to record a 10 GB movie, and with the Paragon NTFS for Mac 12 driver installed, about a minute and a half. <br><br>  I also note that Paragon NTFS for Mac is the first NTFS driver with full support for Mac OS 10.10 Yosemite.  By the way, this is an important advantage of paid solutions over free ones: the latter can no longer be developed tomorrow, plus in their case no one will answer for the safety of your data.  But shareware (in the case of Paragon NTFS for Mac 12) has high-quality technical support and timely updates. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c1c/bd8/309/c1cbd83090eb4282b670ac21f930c64d.png"><br>  And here's another moment.  We know that not all MacBook and iMac owners like to talk about this delicate subject, and yet ... Practice shows that Mac OS and Windows are very close on Apple computers.  Last put, first of all, to run applications that exist for Windows, but missing for Mac OS.  We will not list hundreds of different examples of Windows Only programs; we simply note that most of them belong to the category of games.  So, if using Boot Camp to put Windows on the Mac, formatting for this part of the hard drive in NTFS, then this section will be accessible from under Mac OS only for reading. <br><br>  And if you create in Windows, say, an MS Word document, then after switching to Mac OS it will not be available for editing.  The situation is not very pleasant, but Paragon NTFS for Mac 12 will help to cope with it.  That is, this driver is classified as must have not only for active users of external drives, but also for everyone who wants to ‚Äúsit on two chairs‚Äù using both popular operating systems.  According to some data, in Russia, almost one third of Apple computer owners are engaged in such questionable (from the point of view of orthodox "makovods") affairs. <br><br>  Buy Paragon NTFS for Mac 12 <a href="https://www.cleverbridge.com/80/uurl-c517mjxhgc">here</a> .  Anyone who enters the code <b>ntfs1210</b> when making a purchase will receive a discount of 30%.  Consequently, the driver does not cost 990 rubles, but 693 rubles. <br><br>  Use on health and thank you for your attention! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/366683/">https://habr.com/ru/post/366683/</a></p>
