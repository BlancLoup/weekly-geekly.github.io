We continue the series of articles and videos dedicated to <br>  Intel‚Äôs Russian Data Center and are considering a system today <br>  free cooling or free-cooling. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The entire cooling system of the data center consists of 2 circuits: internal and external. <br>  To the internal - chiller, pumping stations and precision air conditioners. <br>  The principle of the internal circuit is as follows: cold water (its temperature <br>  is 7-8 degrees) from the chiller using pumping stations comes to <br>  precision air conditioners that cool the air directly in the room <br>  Datacenter.  The heat removed from the data center is fed back through pumping stations to <br>  chiller in the form of water heated to 13-14 degrees.  There this water cools again and the cycle <br>  repeats again. <br><br>  Since the chiller is in itself a very heat-consuming device for its <br>  cooling requires the presence of an external circuit, which includes heat exchangers, <br>  directly on the street.  Each heat exchanger itself is <br>  fairly complex device, but for his work almost does not require <br>  electricity than it is fundamentally different from the chiller.  He is not just <br>  coil (as it may seem from the video), there is still a mass of levers, valves, etc. <br>  With their help, the flow is regulated depending on the temperature outside and inside <br>  data center.  So this is quite a ‚Äúsmart‚Äù device.  It is also worth noting that <br>  coolant in the outer circuit through which heat is exchanged between <br>  chiller and the street is glycol (since in winter the water in it simply froze <br>  would).

      For a complete understanding of the entire free-cooling system, it is worth remembering that there is <br>  two technologies of free cooling (we talked about this in the very first review, <br>  dedicated data center) - direct and indirect.  Recall with direct cooling <br>  air from the street is chased directly to the cooling servers.  With indirect free- <br>  The cooling system with the system included the same chillers that we talked about above. <br><br>  The implementation of a direct free-cooling system is justified only in rare cases. <br>  For example, an experiment was conducted in the state of New Mexico in the USA - they built <br>  the data center was about 900 servers and was just cooled by air from the street.  Air there <br>  dry enough, it's desert.  With air humidity control to prevent <br>  corrosion of metal in the cooled equipment, there were no special problems.  In the same <br>  places like England or St. Petersburg, for example, direct free-cooling technology <br>  it is almost impossible to use, because there they will very quickly go out of <br>  building elements of data center equipment. <br><br>  In general, for the Central European climate, as, for example, in Germany or in <br>  France, where it is too warm in summer and too cold in winter, it is necessary <br>  the use of devices that will drive the temperature of the supplied air to <br>  limits for the data center range.  Not to mention Russia, where the temperature difference <br>  during the year reaches 80 degrees and the dependence on such devices is even higher.  Obviously <br>  that when from the street in the summer come 30 degrees and above, it is necessary to cool further <br>  air.  Similarly, it is not good when the air in winter comes too cold.  Therefore, <br>  it's almost impossible to do without a chiller in the summer, and often in the winter (no one <br>  in her right mind she will not give air cooled down to -30 degrees into the room with <br>  servers).  At least 3-5 months a year, the chiller is simply necessary, and therefore, the system <br>  indirect free-cooling is justified in most cases. <br><br>  To summarize the overall implementation of the free-cooling'a.  Water Chillers <br>  in the warm season, when the temperature is low enough, they are turned off and instead of <br>  In the system, they begin to use heat exchangers in which heat from the internal <br>  contour is given to the outside.  This whole system works in automatic mode.  Chiller <br>  it turns on itself when current conditions require it.  In addition, there is <br>  water supply (in large barrels) and when its temperature exceeds a predetermined limit, <br>  the chiller automatically turns on and starts cooling this water.  When will be reached <br>  A sufficient level of its temperature, the chiller will automatically shut down.  That's it <br>  this water also comes in precision air conditioners.  Usually manually interfere <br>  In the process of starting the chiller is not required, except, of course, situations where it is not <br>  starts automatically due to any abnormal situations. <br>  In general, during the implementation of free cooling in the cold season, the cooling system of the data center <br>  somewhat complicated, but the savings in electricity justifies these costs.  Exemplary <br>  The payback period in our Russian climate (of course, it depends on the weather, how much <br>  winters will be cold and long, etc.) averages 2.5 years. <br><br>  Ask a question to Leonid Shishlov <a href="http://ru.intel.com/business/community/%3Fautomodule%3Dblog%26blogid%3D7605%26showentry%3D2488">here</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/125971/">https://habr.com/ru/post/125971/</a></p>
