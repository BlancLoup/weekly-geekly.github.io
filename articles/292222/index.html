What when</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  In recent years, I don‚Äôt have time to read, chat with friends, relax, play sports.  All the time I try to combine everything.  The list of books I want to read has become endless. <br>  For people like me, we are doing <a href="http://www.smartreading.ru/">SmartReading</a> .  But, since from school to short content people have a biased attitude, I want to write in detail why we need services summary. <br>  For a start, tell you what it all is. <br>  Summary is the author's retelling of books of 10-15 pages (each summary has its size, but on average), which outlines the key ideas of the creator of the book. <br>  We do not make summary on fiction books, choosing more practical topics: <br>  ‚Ä¢ marketing, management, sales - prof.  literature for beloved colleagues; <br>  ‚Ä¢ personal effectiveness - there are usually many repetitions in such books; <br>  ‚Ä¢ HLS - heading for those who monitor health.  Allows you to be aware of basic diets, proper exercise; <br>  ‚Ä¢ compulsory reading of an educated person - there are collected books that we consider important for erudition; <br>  ‚Ä¢ psychology - we all want to understand each other.  We briefly describe the main ideas of the books that we consider the most important; <br>  ‚Ä¢ success stories - it's nice to be equal to someone. <br>  For most of the books, we make audio-summary, for a part also infographics. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>  We see the main goals as follows: <br><br>  Acquaintance with new books <br>  Summary is useful for those who want and love to read, but there is not enough time for reading, and sometimes even motivation, because it is often difficult to force yourself to wade through multiple repetitions of authors.

      Time is the most valuable resource in our age.  SmartReading helps to spend this resource more efficiently.  We outsource the hard work that takes time - reworking a pile of books, reading large texts and sowing the golden grains of ideas. <br><br>  Summary allows you to get acquainted with the content of the book in 30 minutes, a place of 5-10 hours and understand whether you need to invest more.  Why 30, not 15?  Because from our point of view, even a concentrate of ideas should be presented harmoniously and beautifully. <br><br>  In addition, reading a new book is not a cheap pleasure.  The average price of a book on a business topic or topic of self-development ranges from 400 to 1000 rubles.  The choice is huge, it‚Äôs difficult to navigate and we often have to buy the cover, and not the essence of the book (experience in publishing allows you to know well what it is about). <br>  Giving the opportunity to learn the ideas of the book in advance, we want to help the reader to easily navigate and decide whether he needs the full version of the book or you can limit the summary. <br><br>  2. Repetition of the read. <br>  I regularly want to return to the books: to realize or rethink important moments, to remember something that we have not yet realized in life, just to refresh key points in memory. <br>  Since  the books that we do with the summary are of an applied nature, they are returned more often.  And coming back, it is more convenient to analyze 10 pages, and not 350. <br><br>  Summary do not replace books.  They are needed to help save time: choose a book, remember it or understand that another time. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/292222/">https://habr.com/ru/post/292222/</a></p>
