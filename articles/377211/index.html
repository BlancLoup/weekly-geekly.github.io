The requirements were as follows: <br><br><ul><li>  Not far from Kiev, were considered plots up to 30km </li><li>  Not far from my parents and spouses who stay in Kiev </li><li>  Smaller people, more nature. </li></ul><br>  As a result, was selected from.  Zazimye, Brovarsky district.  10 kilometers to the border of the city.  It is convenient to go home by taxi if something is wrong with the car.  Plot was selected, purchased.  And then the local power company "spread her hands."  I was shocked.  I expected to resolve the issue for a maximum of 5K $, but it turned out "as always."  So I came to alternative sources of electricity. <br><br>  The first experience was interesting.  We poured the foundation using a 950W FIRMAN generator, a small concrete mixer (40 l) and on weekends.  All this was placed in Slavuta.  A small house of 18m2 + attic was built, on a simple frame, in which we now live from time to time.  Mostly in warm weather, of course.  Near the village we remove a piece of the house for the winter time.  Speech and go about electrifying this house.

    <h2>  Start </h2><br>  Two Chinese-made solar panels of 180W each were purchased.  Was purchased controller POLM EPSOLAR at 20A.  Two lead-acid batteries of 100Ach each got a very preferential price and the FORT FX55 inverter.  Later, I was also presented with a 12-220 car converter for 300W.  And before that, I still bought a 150W fanless car converter. <br><br>  With the equipment sorted out. <br><br>  Here is a snapshot of the characteristics of a single panel: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/da7/494/181/da7494181aea496e833890d0a45a68a6.jpg"><br><br>  Here is what the panels give out on the twentieth: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/afe/3b6/217/afe3b62178924444926cd386c134c128.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/885/e85/64b/885e8564b6824e8c9b1dbd3b4fa8ee08.jpg"><br><br>  Photo immediately after installation on the roof: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/570/c34/13c/570c3413c9dc429d9834f36c4974c20d.jpg"><br><br><h2>  Life, consumption </h2><br>  I live, you know, IT life.  Convinced freelancer, occasionally trying to create something more independent freelance cham.  Who cares, you can come to visit me <br><br>  All of the above feeds: Macbook Pro 2010, phones, books, tablets, 3G router, HP LaserJet 1020 printer. Screwdriver charging, 1100W water pumping station, a couple of searchlights to the street with motion and illumination sensors.  Lighting in the house LED 12V. <br><br>  There is also a 2.5 kW generator Centaur.  4 stroke.  Oil separately, and 95th gasoline separately.  Consumption 0.5 liters per hour.  Very economical work.  It now runs a concrete mixer when it is required. <br><br>  In the kitchen in a small house now stands a gas cylinder 4.8 liters, without gear.  Type "tourist", but it works constantly.  Suffices for two weeks when cooking three times a day.  I pass by the gas station regularly, so there are no problems with refueling. <br><br>  Here is how my farm looked this winter: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/076/5b8/745/0765b8745960435da9e19e63d1a34cb4.JPG"><br><br><h2>  Big house and plans for it </h2><br>  As I already wrote, the network was originally planned for it, so the FORT FX55 inverter (3500W / 5500W starting) was bought.  The roof is designed for 20 180W solar panels, so that they would ‚Äúbecome at a 50 degree angle.‚Äù  I have this latitude.  I read somewhere that at our latitude we must put at an angle of 50 degrees - this is the most optimal angle.  I will buy batteries gel, I will put a separate new controller. <br><br>  There will be a stove with which I will take electricity for lighting in the winter (see <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25AD%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD%25D1%2582_%25D0%259F%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BB%25D1%258C%25D1%2582%25D1%258C%25D0%25B5">ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Element_Peltier</a> ).  It will also be removed from the stove: hot water, water heating (floor + batteries).  The stove will be "dvuhkolpakovaya."  For aesthetics add a fireplace. <br><br>  In the kitchen, a gas stove and a gas stove (oh, and it was difficult to find) an oven.  Built into the furniture. <br>  Questions?  Comments? <br><br>  I‚Äôll make a reservation right away that, despite the 4 points for TOE, I don‚Äôt remember the basics of electrical engineering.  Well, except that Ohm's law, which is a special case of the second rule of Kirchhoff.  Everything was done according to logic and read from the Internet. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/377211/">https://habr.com/ru/post/377211/</a></p>
