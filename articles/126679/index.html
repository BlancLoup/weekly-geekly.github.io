Facubook and Twitter contributed to the spread of information, like a virus.  The official <a href="http://www.facebook.com/pages/RIP-Mark-Duggan/200659976657547">memory page of the ‚Äúinnocently murdered‚Äù Mark Daggan</a> in a matter of hours was filled with thousands of sympathizers.

      It was from the participants of this page that the first calls were made to take revenge on the "beating policemen", the process of mass distribution of the avengers, captured on the video "feats", was launched, with calls to be posted wherever possible with the mention of what caused such consequences.  Twitter picked up a dubious initiative, literally screaming from messages on this topic.  There have even been some attempts at coordinating the actions of the rebels.  However, these attempts were successfully suppressed by the police, which was ready for such a turn. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The Canadian brand BlackBerry played a key <a href="http://urbanmashup.wordpress.com/2011/08/07/the-unlikely-social-network-fuelling-the-tottenham-riots/">role in coordinating the actions of the participants in the English conflict</a> quite unexpectedly for everyone (and for himself).  It would seem that a respectable business-class smartphone maker has in common with unemployed youth and immigrants from third world countries?  The answer is known - BBM from Research in Motion. <br><br>  What, in essence, is the BlackBerry Messenger?  This is not just a text message exchange, it is a whole social network.  And at the same time, it is closed to all but the owners of BlackBerry smartphones, and reliably protected from infringement by the famous RIM encryption.  If you add here the lack of fees for use, then the reason for the choice of BBM by the parties to the conflict becomes quite obvious.  It is not clear why the police were not ready for this. <br><br>  BlackBerry has become <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/blackberry/8295074/Blackberry-growth-is-driven-by-teenagers-and-corporations.html">extremely popular among young people in Britain</a> .  The main advantage in choosing was BBM with its <a href="http://www.ferra.ru/ru/soft/news/2011/07/29/rim-releases-bbm-6/">encryption, cheapness, the ability to send messages by</a> mailing. <br><br>  The consequences of the unrest in Egypt, Tunisia, Libya, and now in London have caused governments and other countries to become concerned about the fear of repeating the British experience of using high technology. <br><br>  In India, law enforcement began a campaign to make it easier to access personal data from users on networks such as Twitter and Facebook.  They want confidential information to be issued on a simple request without receiving a special order.  Not less there are pressing on RIM with the requirements of the possibility of providing access to mail and user negotiations. <br><br>  In Britain itself, too, people think about the application of radical measures - a proposal has been put forward in parliament, if not to prohibit the use of BlackBerry, so at least to stop using encryption.  RIM has not yet given consent to take such measures. <br><br>  It is known that some time ago Saudi Arabia applied similar requirements to a Canadian corporation.  There, RIM refused, arguing that it was the client‚Äôs right to privacy, and those who are always right about encrypting keys are the ones that left the BlackBerry phones out of the law in this country. <br><br>  After the events in the UK, RIM‚Äôs reputation as a safe company has, on the one hand, been strengthened, but on the other, it has shaken.  The company‚Äôs leaders, in an attempt to rectify everything, <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2011/aug/08/london-riots-blackberry-messenger-looting">openly declared cooperation with the police</a> , promising to provide confidential information about their clients who were close to the sources of conflict.  In response to this statement, <a href="http://www.blackberrycool.com/2011/08/09/blackberry-blog-hacked-in-response-to-rim-statement-hackers-threaten-to-reveal-employee-info/">hackers hacked the RIM blog</a> . <br><br>  It is doubtful that RIM is committed to such a development.  Unwittingly, BlackBerry has become a symbol of anarchy and pogroms.  Or is it revolution and freedom? <br><br>  What will be next?  The first step was cooperation with the police, and hence the authorities, but so far only the UK.  It is unlikely that a <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/innovationlab/blog/123205/">company experiencing such difficulties today</a> may lose an unexpected, but extensive segment of the market, represented by outside-controlled young people between the ages of 14 and 24. <br><br>  Making desperate attempts to <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/innovationlab/blog/124257/">survive in the smartphone market, known for its bestial customs</a> , RIM is also unlikely to give up one of its main trump cards - BBM with the famous data encryption.  After all, this feature attracts not only the organizers of street riots, but also <a href="http://www.innovationlab.ru/blog/64-zashchishchennyj-dokumentooborot-na-planshetakh.html">officials who are concerned about the preservation of confidential information</a> . <br><br>  Disadvantages often have a continuation of the merits.  And RIM is no exception.  Therefore, the trust and love of Research in Motion, whose BlackBerry PlayBook was the first <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/innovationlab/blog/125145/">FIPS-certified tablet for use by the</a> US <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/innovationlab/blog/125145/">federal government</a> , and after that received certain preferences from other governments, can easily be replaced if not by hate, then by fear.  That for RIM in its current state is of mortal danger. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/126679/">https://habr.com/ru/post/126679/</a></p>
