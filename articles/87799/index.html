I could not find comparisons of these devices on the Russian Internet, only exclamations like Windows is nonsense, but Blackberry has a completely different level.  Comment on what and how really no one can ... <a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h4>  How did these devices turn out to be with me ... </h4>  I personally used the HTC 4G for about six months, I recently acquired a ‚Äúblackberry‚Äù.  The reasons were simple - HTC was used including.  for navigation in the car, and it was not convenient to talk, we had to be distracted from the road for a few seconds, which is not good.  For a small amount, I bought the Blackberry 8800 to test what is blackberry with its unique services and at the same time as a dialer.  At the same time, HTC was used for mobile surfing of the Internet, asi and Yota modem for a laptop, which is very convenient, if not for one circumstance - I bought a MacBook Pro and couldn‚Äôt be used as a USB modem, only via Bluetooth.  But as you know, this technology has a serious speed limit, I can not say exactly what, I think about 50kb / s.  And the iota worked REALLY at speeds of 1-5 Mbit.  About 8800 I can say one thing, it slows down when surfing the Internet (Opera mini 5 beta 2) and generally not a fast device, very simple, but it worked for about 3-4 days with a large load and caught everywhere where it doesn‚Äôt catch much.  Ball also got, especially in the calculator.  So it was decided to buy the top version of Blackbury (with a touchscreen, otherwise they will say that 9700 is newer ...)

    <h4>  What immediately catches the eye </h4>  The designs of the devices are similar, the blackberry is slightly smaller and has smoother shapes.  There is no stylus, in HTC they are already 2 (spare in the kit), although it does not need to work in general.  There is no second photo-camera, but I personally never used it to HTC. <br><br><h4>  Screen </h4>  The screen on the HTC is slightly larger in area, but the blackberry color conveys better in my opinion.  It is also worth noting the unique technology of Blackberry - SureType.  At the heart of the well-known (for iPhone) capacitive screen.  The essence of the technology SureType is to eliminate accidental clicks, touching the screen you just select the application or link, and clicking on it makes a "click" and for example launching the application.  Moreover, a click in the literal sense of the word, the screen is ‚Äúpressed through‚Äù by 0.5mm and you feel a click with your finger, very much like a MacBook touchpad - one big button.  This is quite convenient, especially when printing, and it is unusual when I take into the hands of HTC is not arbitrarily trying to "click." <br><br><h4>  Camera </h4>  The main camera is a blackberry 3.2Mp with a "flash", in contrast to the 2.0Mp on HTC without a flash, both with autofocus.  The quality of the cameras of both devices is high, the documents are very clear. <br><br><h4>  Communication </h4><img src="http://s19.radikal.ru/i192/1003/d2/237d604a8ada.jpg"><br>  It should be noted a very convenient function of HTC - screen lock during a call, when the phone is near the ear, apparently there is a proximity sensor, when you take the phone away from your ear, the backlight turns on.  On the "blackberry" screen is simply blocked, it is not so convenient, and there were a couple of cases when the speakerphone was turned on with an ear .. <br>  The quality of speech on both devices is very, very decent, did not cause problems.  On WM, you can easily implement the function of recording conversations (automatically) by installing software such as VITO Audio Notes, and on blackberry I could not implement this function. <br><br><h4>  Business use </h4><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/31a/d37/251/31ad3725101f6edb413bcd58cae7102c.jpg"><br>  For our company, we bought 3 Blackberry 8800, as I wrote above.  In our business - development and promotion of websites ( <a href="http://www.saytik.ru/">www.saytik.ru</a> ), communication, quick answers to customer questions, communication within the company, setting up meetings, and so on, occupy an extremely important place, and I'll tell you about it now. <br><br>  The main "chip" Blackberry is their unique technology.  The essence is in constant communication with the server, which allows you to synchronize mail, contacts, tasks, notes and calendar + some software settings.  It is incredibly convenient when someone sends me mail, after about 2-3 seconds it is on my device.  For those who use communications tightly, this is a must have.  I can create a task or schedule an appointment in the calendar, and then it will be displayed on a computer in MS Outlook or MS Entourage (Mac OS).  Also available is a web interface, very similar to Outlook.  I can invite a colleague to a meeting.  In addition, the technology includes data compression and PowerPoint presentations or other attachments load faster than other devices.  The main task of the ‚Äúblackberry‚Äù is to immediately receive mail, download the attachment, display it, edit and send it efficiently and conveniently.  He copes with this flawlessly, iPhone and HTC are not competitive at all.  If you lose your phone, they will erase all information and block it, and after you buy a new one, you do not need to connect to a PC, just contact the server administrator and enter the mail address and password into the device settings; within 10-15 minutes all contacts will be loaded, mail (200 recent messages), tasks, notes and so on.  There are two types of services described above BIS and BES.  The first for physical.  persons and costs about 350 rubles \ month, provides it to MTS and Beeline.  At the same time, at least mail traffic is free and you cannot use mail on your domain, only with the help of redirection.  BES is provided for legal entities, is a separate north, you can buy it (the price will unpleasantly surprise you) or rent it (for example, in Delta Mobile).  The service costs 1000r \ month + server rental 1000r \ month + order mail exchange hosting about 400r \ month (all prices for 1 mailbox).  BES encrypts the data, and so encrypts that the FSB could not decrypt until they were given access codes.  In addition, the traffic for mail, Asya, Internet surfing (Opera Mini 5) and many other programs is free, Yandex.karti too, but I haven‚Äôt yet been able to implement this on the 9520, but on 8800 everything worked.  Delta mobiles blamed it on the fact that they have no such device and it is not officially shipped to Russia.  You can also link your corporate email to your domain, which is important to me. <br><br><h4>  Operating Systems </h4>  It's easier to write about what I felt after switching from WM 6.1 to Blackberry OS5.0.  The system interface is very pleasant, does not slow down, with the effects of the appearance and gestures.  In general, both devices are adapted to work with a finger, it is convenient, but I want to note that typing text on blackberry is more convenient, but sometimes I get past the key, although my fingers are thin and problems rarely appeared on Windows, write it off using the habit and feature 9520 relative to the button.  However, in a landscape arrangement, the situation is somewhat different, on HTC, the keys expand and blur, and on the ‚Äúblackberry‚Äù you can print with two fingers very, very quickly. <br><br><h4>  the Internet </h4>  On the "blackberry" is EDGE, 3G, Wi-Fi, and on HTC - EDGE, 4G, Wi-Fi.  It should be added that the Russian regulator prohibits the use of Wi-Fi on Blackberry in the Russian Federation, this problem can be circumvented if you use the BIS service, and if you prefer BES, then alas, Wi-Fi will not be available, but it is not really needed.  3G on the biline while there is little where there is + consumes more energy, and the difference in speed is not so different, I turned off.  4G from Yota on HTC also consumes not a little energy, but the speed is very decent 2-3 Mbit on average, depends on the reception, and the coverage in Moscow is already more than 90%. <br><br><h4>  Working hours </h4>  Blekberi lasts a day with a heavy load - about 3 hours, 30 letters mail, about 2 hours calls + Internet surfing for an hour.  But I must say that I do not have an original battery (as it turned out ...) and it holds 2 times less than the original (I already ordered it), as shown by a survey among owners.  HTC lasts for 2 days with an average load, I did not read the mail on it, only the Internet + asya. <br><br><h4>  Purchase </h4> HTC can be freely bought in the store, at the flea market and so on.  Blackberry 8800, 8900, 9000 can also be bought anywhere.  But with the Storm and Storm 2 problem - in the Russian Federation, they are not supplied yet, these are new models.  Sell ‚Äã‚Äãa few shops, but more expensive than you can buy on ebay, the cost at the same time at 200-300 dollars.  Less - about 10-15 thousand rubles.  This variation is explained by the model, the 9550 has GSM and CDMA standards, it is cheaper around 10-12 thousand, the Americans sell.  A 9520 sells Vodafone in Europe - England, Germany and works only in GSM, is considered less buggy and costs more than 14-15 thousand.  The current hype with the mail and ebey should not be taken into account, because  EMC mail has its own customs and delivery time about 2-3 weeks.  I also twice encountered the problem of connecting to services, which is why I can‚Äôt say, roofing felts in the wrong device unlocking, roofing felts in what else.  Russian language is added to the system without any problems.  I note that Beeline does not connect ‚Äúgray‚Äù phones to BIS, and MTS has no problems. <br><br><h4>  Equipment </h4>  Blackberry comes with a PC cable, charging, a leather case with a sensor (the phone determines when it is in the case), disks, booklets, and so on. <br><br><h4>  Video and photo review </h4>  Not voiced, like so everything is clear.  I will only note that on HTC there is not a standard firmware and I already forgot how to use it :) this caused a small dullness with the photo. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/wdhEzgJtzok%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=25657,15700019,15700186,15700190,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhjBxqutEk_QfJpyV6VfU5pOitbpng" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/b9e/81e/6e5/b9e81e6e56b7b798c2362695b0046faa.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/6bf/e6d/713/6bfe6d7135da5c41d1a30222107ed479.jpg"><br><img src="http://s002.radikal.ru/i197/1003/51/1601d0df2833.jpg"><br><img src="http://i067.radikal.ru/1003/dc/054b0c4b3925.jpg"><br><br><br>  <b>If you have questions about services or devices, I'm glad to answer.</b>  <b>As well as any additions / comments on the article.</b> <br>  Another topic about Blackberry - <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/phones/70038/">http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/phones/70038/</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/87799/">https://habr.com/ru/post/87799/</a></p>
