In 2016, we witnessed big changes with the release of the full AngularJS upgrade and the announcement of Angular 2, the final jQuery championship, which is used in 96.5% of all sites, ECMAScript evolution, two Node.js updates in April and October, respectively, and even more .  What to expect from 2017?  Here's what we know by this time: Angular 4 is expected in March 2017, release ES2017 is planned in mid-2017, release of Bootstrap v4 is also expected this year. <br><br> <a href="https://adioma.com/%40depart/infographic/5-populyarnyh-js-freymvorkov"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/_f/gn/kx/_fgnkxaw-wacld-esezcj1k2lzc.png"><br></a> <br>  Recently, JavaScript has taken its place among the best languages ‚Äã‚Äãto study according to IBM in 2017.  At this stage, it is used both for the client and for the server side and helps to design attractive interfaces, enrich web applications with numerous functions and features, modify web pages in real time and much more. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Meanwhile, JavaScript frameworks can become a wand for rapid web application development.  They serve as a framework for individual pages of the application, allowing developers to worry less about the structure of the code or support while they are focused on creating complex interface elements. <br><br><h3>  Advantages of using JavaScript frameworks: </h3><br><ul><li>  <b>Efficiency</b> - projects that previously would take months and hundreds of lines of code can now be implemented much faster with well-structured ready-made templates and functions. </li><li>  <b>Security</b> - the best JavaScript frameworks have a proprietary security system and are supported by a large community whose members and users simply act as testers. </li><li>  <b>Costs</b> are most open source frameworks and are free.  Since they help programmers to develop custom solutions faster, the final price of a web application will be lower. </li></ul><br><h3>  Top JavaScript frameworks in 2017: </h3><br><h3>  <b>Angular s</b> </h3><br> <a href="https://angularjs.org/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/57e/fac/059/57efac05984f4c8ca3b566f22d7830eb.jpg"><br></a> <br>  After the long-awaited release of Angular back in 2016, its popularity has reached new heights, but it will keep the bar still in 2017.

      <b><a href="https://www.liveedu.tv/learn/angular-js/">Angular.js is</a></b> often called the MVW (Model-View-Whatever) framework and among the main benefits for start-ups and medium-sized companies are called: fast code writing, quick testing of any part of the application, and two-way data binding (changes in the backend are immediately reflected in the user interface ).  Since its release, the ecosystem has gone beyond imagination.  Now it is deservedly called the most used JS framework for developing single-page applications (SPA Single-Page-Applications) and it boasts the largest developer community. <br><br>  <a href="https://angular.io/"><b>Angular2</b></a> comes with a large list of features that will allow you to develop everything from web to desktop and mobile applications.  The framework is built on Microsoft's TypeScript with an eye to making JavaScript more flexible and attractive for large enterprises.  The ng2 functions have a component-based architecture, improved DI (dependency injection), efficient service logs, inter-component communication, and much more.  <a href="https://www.liveedu.tv/nvxme/videos/pQMQz-ru-2048-game-in-angular-2">An example of the</a> development of the game on Angular2: <br><br> <a href="https://www.liveedu.tv/nvxme/videos/pQMQz-ru-2048-game-in-angular-2"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/021/a5c/c80/021a5cc802274000a5a27f7e7b82cf47.png"><br></a> <br>  Both Angular are the best option for enterprise applications or for programming environments with high standards for code readability. <br><br><h3>  <b><a href="https://www.liveedu.tv/learn/react-js/">ReactJS</a></b> </h3><br> <a href="https://facebook.github.io/react/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/982/8f5/09b/9828f509bfd542d7b9ad1a38275eafba.png"><br></a> <br>  Despite the fact that it is more a library than a framework.  It stands behind the Facebook user interface and instagram, showing its effectiveness inside dynamic applications with high traffic (bandwidth). <br><br>  It is considered to be the fastest growing JS framework: today there are about 1,000 Github authors.  In the MVC (Model-View-Controller) model, React.js acts as a ‚ÄúV‚Äù and can be easily integrated into any architecture.  Through the use of a virtual DOM tree, it provides greater performance gains compared to Angular 1.x.  In addition to this, React components can be created and reused in other applications or even transferred for public use. <br><br>  Despite the fact that React is more difficult to learn, it makes application development simple and easy to understand.  In addition, it can be ideal for complex, impressive software solutions with a high degree of load. <br><br>  <a href="https://www.liveedu.tv/inkblotty/videos/M5PDn-react-app-for-a-client">An example of</a> developing an application on React.js. <br><br><h3>  <a href="https://www.liveedu.tv/learn/vue-js/"><b>Vue.js</b></a> </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/423/f3a/89e/423f3a89ea1a44e5bcf8ecb103fa4153.jpg"><br><br>  <b>Vue 2.0 was</b> also introduced in 2016 and took the best of Ember, React and Angular, putting it all in convenient packaging.  He proved that he could be (he was) faster and more compact React and Angular 2.0. <br><br>  Going deep, Vue.js offers two-way data binding (as in AngularJS), server-side visualization (as in Angular2 and ReactJS), Vue-cli (scaffolding tool for quick start), and optionally support for JSX.  Its creator claims that Vue2 is one of the fastest frameworks in general. <br><br>  Vue.js is the best choice for the rapid development of cross-platform applications.  It can be a solid foundation for high-performance single-page applications (SPAs) and a cost-effective solution for cases where performance is more important than good code organization or application structure. <br><br>  <a href="https://www.liveedu.tv/xanf/videos/WrrjQ-ru-lets-vue-13">Lecture</a> with the analysis of the features Vue.js. <br><br><h3>  <a href="http://emberjs.com/"><b>Ember.js</b></a> </h3><br> <a href="http://emberjs.com/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/5a0/666/669/5a0666669614487c8bb99ebd7e1a5e75.png"><br></a> <br>  Back in 2015, Ember was named the best JS framework, leaving React and AngularJS behind.  Today, it boasts a huge online community, regular updates and widely used best practices in Java Script that guarantee the ultimate experience right out of the box. <br><br>  Ember has two-way data binding, as in AngularJS, keeps both the look and the model in sync for the entire time.  The use of the Fastboot.js module provides fast rendering (rendering, recalculation) of the DOM tree on the server side, improving the presentation of complex user interfaces. <br><br>  Emberjs is commonly used for complex rich web applications and websites.  Top users include Chipotle, Blue Apron, Nordstrom, Kickstarter, LinkedIn, Netflix and many others.  Moreover, it is the easiest to learn and there is a sea of ‚Äã‚Äãtutorials and guides available online. <br><br><h3>  <a href="https://www.liveedu.tv/learn/meteor-js/"><b>Meteor.js</b></a> </h3><br> <a href="https://www.meteor.com/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/fb9/18b/c9a/fb918bc9ab1b4f0faf26fa642381b4b5.png"><br></a> <br>  Meteor is one of the most popular JS frameworks, but it steadily walks with a ton of functions for backend development and front-end rendering, database management and business logic.  Since its release in 2012, its ecosystem has grown at a dramatic pace.  This full stack platform allows you to quickly develop web and mobile applications.  From a performance point of view, all changes in the database are immediately transferred to the user interface and back without any visible loss of time caused by a difference in languages ‚Äã‚Äãor in the response time of the server. <br><br>  <a href="https://www.liveedu.tv/zav39/videos/gg4gA-developing-mmo-with-meteorjs-consulwarru-22">An example of</a> MMO development on Meteor.js: <br><br> <a href="https://www.liveedu.tv/zav39/videos/gg4gA-developing-mmo-with-meteorjs-consulwarru-22"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c57/394/384/c57394384e1d41b5a2c511af1d3ebb1f.png"><br></a> <br>  Meteor.js covers all stages of the software development cycle and takes care of processes such as linking, file concatenation, and more.  Freymork is now used to develop real-time applications in companies such as Mazda, IKEA, Honeywell, and many others. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/9ba/514/3b2/9ba5143b2c874b2c951fabdf657dc98c.png"><br><br><h3>  Conclusion </h3><br>  The choice of framework is not based on the functionality that each of them can offer.  It depends on the company's initial goals, project requirements, the overall framework functionality and how it can be applied in each specific case. <br><br>  When it comes to rapid web development or prototyping, JS frameworks are the most popular to use and 2017 will not be an exception.  These frameworks and libraries have already changed the way that JS interacts with HTML and CSS to combine views in browsers and native platforms. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/321844/">https://habr.com/ru/post/321844/</a></p>
