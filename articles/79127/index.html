    <h2>  Jabber </h2><br>  Most recently, my long-time acquaintance decided to have a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jabber">Jabber</a> .  Thanks to Habra, where I found out about a <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/jabber/53951/">good link</a> . <br>  According to it, we chose a good server, with transports and a large uptime.  During the selection process, it turned out that a friend has an account at mail.ru, and therefore there is a jabber. <br><br>  - Wow!  - I thought.  - But my mail moved there too! <br>  I immediately opened the domain domain Nm.ru, but I got a fig.  Attempts to connect to the pochta.ru hmrr server with different combinations of my login and nm.ru domain did not lead to success.  Apparently, no luck, I thought, and put aside the old ‚Äúdream‚Äù - mail, MSN, JID of the form name@nm.ru. <br><br><h2>  So what am I talking about?  Kip ... </h2><br><br>  I heard about the package, tried it, a good alternative to the official client. <br>  However, Miranda is our everything, and I never used the bale, and I did not intend to. <br>  Recently, the kip passed under the wing of RBC (which, by the way, was banned in my browser from time immemorial, it seems there were once banners or some kind of counters), after which the kip was overgrown with so many so-called ‚Äúservices‚Äù about which not <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/im/66209/">two</a> was written on Habr√©. <br><br>  So yesterday, I accidentally opened the nm.ru again.  And lo and behold - I saw a short list of services, and even Pong came to the ping!  But authentication, of course, did not pass.  Having logged in again on nm.ru, I was amid with pochta.ru, and <s>having entered my login / password</s> by pressing Ctrl + Enter I logged in ... to mail.qip.ru! <br><br><h2>  OMG!  WTF?!? </h2><br><br>  Yes, so here.  RBC has combined pochta.ru and kip.  Now on all second-level domains, hmrr redirect on webim.qip.ru <br><br>  However, the story does not end there.  My account did not pass authorization, the server stupidly told me that my password was not the same, <s>and to call me in any way</s> .  Rummaged on wiki.qip.ru, rummaged on forum.qip.ru, but found nothing suitable. <br>  Along the way, it turned out that my name@nm.ru is just an alias attached to another login, but it was also possible to log in using the alias.  There was also a web client, √† la glam chat in Gmail.  Which, oddly enough, also did not go online;) <br><br>  With a real login, webim.qip.ru also did not allow.  I even downloaded the <a href="">spec.</a>  <a href="">kip</a> , qipinfium_pochta.exe;) <br>  He also said that I have the wrong password. <br><br>  I began to suspect that admin pochta.ru and kip mix in a blender a bunch of domains and accounts is not so easy ... <br>  And then I ... <br>  ... changed the password through the web of kip mail.  And lo and behold!  I could connect to hmrr on the main login! <br>  With alias, of course, nothing has changed. <br><br><h2>  What to do? </h2><br><br>  I opened the page with the registration of a new account, filled out the required fields and deleted the alias, immediately registering it again as a separate login.  What is interesting, having confirmed the account on the link sent, I couldn‚Äôt go to the webmail of the bale for some time, but the jabber was connected immediately. <br><br><h2>  Hooray! </h2><br><br>  A blessing in disguise, and now my mail has gone through several rebirths and has become Jabber too. <br>  Now I have mail, jed and msn - the same and beautiful, it is a pity that Skype does not allow using the dog in the login :( <br><br>  Question to you,%% username! <br>  And what else can I fasten to my mail? </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/79127/">https://habr.com/ru/post/79127/</a></p>
