  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Answers to questions habrovchan</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Not later than the day before yesterday, I suggested throwing in questions from the company Planet3, the <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/mobile_payment/43433/">interview with the general director of</a> which was published on Habr√© before the official announcement of the start of the company.  Having collected what the habrovans sent, I asked Planet3 to try to respond as quickly as possible.  The result is offered to your attention, style, etc. - saved as is. <br><br>  1. Why payments are so small.  After all, they reached 60 percent, and now - 49 percent.  What kind of mockery? <br><br>  We have never taken an aggressive position in the market, trying to attract everyone without discrimination at any cost.  Accordingly, we do not see the need to publish super-attractive rates on the site, and then play games with fraud limits, courses and blockages.  By reducing our commission to the absolute minimum, we would, in fact, build a financial pyramid, when already working partners would completely depend on the connection of new and the slightest fluctuations of the market.  There is no need to go far for examples.

    <a name="habracut"></a>  2. I have a portal with boobs and genitals.  But honestly, no horses and children.  Will you take me to partners? <br><br>  We have special requirements for adult services, both for the content of the services themselves and for the methods of their promotion, so everything will depend on your compliance with the agreement, in which these conditions will be clearly stated.  We have a special monitoring service, it will track these points, and in case of violation of the terms of the contract, the service will be immediately closed. <br><br>  3. I have a Webmoney purse replenishment system via SMS.  What can I expect from you? <br><br>  We are extremely cautious to cooperate with such systems.  Opacity, their high attractiveness for various kinds of fraudsters lead to a high level of risk. <br><br>  4. My weekly turnover by SMS was about $ 100,000, give me better conditions?  Interested in a higher percentage and weekly payment. <br><br>  In this case, we are ready to discuss the terms of cooperation with you individually.  I am sure that we will be able to come to a mutually beneficial option. <br><br>  5. You can not believe.  You all throw just as it did before you ****** and *****.  Why should I believe you?  Do not pour me about stability, about development, about the fact that everything is fine.  Before you, I was all hanged like noodles and threw everything. <br><br>  So far, for two and a half years of work in the micropayment market, we have not given anyone the reason to say that we, as you put it, ‚Äúthrew‚Äù it.  So it's a matter of reputation.  Planet3 is not a one-day company that decided to make money quickly: we understand that a good reputation today is an investment in the future, and we intend to work in this market honestly, developing it to the common good - and yours, and operators, and consumers. <br><br>  6. You have written the cost of an SMS in dollars on your website, and you pay in rubles.  That dollar in October rose by 2 rubles, and that you pay at the rate at the end of October, or deceive, and pay at the rate of 2 rubles less?  Why you can not light prices in rubles, maybe you should not register? <br><br>  First of all, we were the first to start publishing accurate rates for all numbers available to partners, because we understand that this is important for both partners and end users.  Tariffs can be found on the website <a href="http://rates.planet3.ru/">rates.planet3.ru</a> .  Secondly, our settlement scheme is extremely transparent: we offer terms only in rubles and payments in the preferred currency at the rate of the Central Bank of the Russian Federation on the last day of the reporting period. <br><br>  7. In the "Russian billing" I wrote scripts to post billing on my site for free.  And you write?  After all, you have a completely different platform, probably? <br><br>  Our platform is much richer in capabilities, which, however, does not complicate its use for partners.  We have ready-made software modules and we are ready to help with the integration of our solutions into your service. <br><br>  8. Tell me, why do you have such a dull background color on the site?  Say purple is the color of schizophrenia?  Why not red? <br><br>  In fact, purple, as many psychologists and designers believe, is the color of highly developed intellect :) But let's not argue about tastes.  And then, I think, the main thing is not to like the background color on the site, but the content itself is fine. <br><br>  9. Why did you call the company Planet3 and not Planet3.14? <br><br>  Because we like round numbers! <br><br>  10. Something dull all.  Information in the public domain - zero, at Russian billing everything was painted from and to, and you - stubs of the text, nothing is clear, and this background ... <br><br>  Stay tuned for news and updates.  In the near future there will be a lot of interesting things. <br><br>  11. And will it be possible to withdraw the money earned in cash in your office?  Zadolbala this uncertainty, the banks burst, Webmoney has to cash out.  Why not make a cashier and pay cash, huh? <br><br>  No, this will not be possible.  We are not ready to put the business of our partners and our own business in dependence on dubious financial schemes. <br><br>  12. Oooo, so you're from Peter.  I do not believe you.  Is there an office in Moscow to sign contracts and acts? <br><br>  We even have representative offices in China, India and Brazil.  Of course, there is an office in Moscow.  And Peter, by the way, is a great city - by the way, it was there, as a matter of fact, that mobile supplementary services began. <br><br>  13. You say that you are independent of i-Free, and why everywhere on the site you can only see ifree yes ayfri.  Isn't it funny to read the Awards section? <br><br>  Planet3 companies are only a few days old, but we want our new partners to know who we are and where we came from in the market, under which brand we worked before.  In addition, we can rightfully share the honor of all these awards with i-Free, as they have a significant contribution from the team that now works in Planet3. <br><br>  14. Hire a designer and a copywriter already, do not disgrace with such a site! <br><br>  As we have said, due to the circumstances prevailing in the market, we had to force the opening of the company, and in these conditions, the priority for us was, of course, not website design, but quick solution of important business issues.  Work on the site is ongoing and soon it will be improved. <br><br>  15. Tell me, what exactly is the payment period?  If, say, you write 30 days in the contract - will there be any penalties for late payment?  Or, as always, will the support service feed me? <br><br>  The main component of our strategy is to offer stable, absolutely predictable terms of cooperation and we will meet the deadlines that will be specified in the contract.  The exception, of course, can be force majeure, but they will also be spelled out in the contract. <br><br>  That's all for now.  If you have any more questions - send in PM, not a single question will remain unanswered :) <br><br>  Ivan Khrustalev, especially for Habrahabr <br></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/43622/">https://habr.com/ru/post/43622/</a></p>
