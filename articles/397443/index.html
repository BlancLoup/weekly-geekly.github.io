  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Review of the Telemetrika GSM Socket</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"> Automation and smart devices are sweeping across the planet.  Most likely, it is already difficult to find a modern apartment or house without any automatic system.  The most useful and simple automatic devices are sockets.  Whether it is just mechanical to electronic timers, or sockets capable of being remotely controlled via various communication channels.  GSM socket from Telemetrika is a prominent representative of domestic automatic devices for simple power management.  Consider it in more detail. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/5c8/1d8/508/5c81d85087c8408ea6268ef7078a5771.jpg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  So, the socket is in a tight box. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/83b/d51/9cc/83bd519cc268483695bd8efd1ffacc24.jpg">

      The box itself is informative and allows you to understand what is inside and what it serves. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c99/9c8/c35/c999c8c35eaa4d34b2e37570451adb89.jpg"><br><br>  The box itself contains: an instruction manual, an automatic socket and a separate module - a temperature sensor. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a65/cc2/8bf/a65cc28bf6dc4099a4fd39e3660be8a1.jpg"><br><br>  The sensor is made in an interesting form factor.  He has a papa jack jack.  By the type of interfaced devices to phones through headphones. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ea9/c6b/a28/ea9c6ba28e0043c384d908802c7019c5.jpg"><br><br>  The socket itself has a connector for connecting this sensor, a mini USB, apparently for the ability to fix the firmware or connect to a computer and a button for manually turning the power on and off. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b82/4bb/bda/b824bbbda591460dac3b7524ba2ecefe.jpg"><br><br>  On the other side is the SIM card slot. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/6f4/d8a/cc7/6f4d8acc70184a55adc2fef6a4c84c5c.jpg"><br><br>  In front there is a connector for plug 220V and two status indicators - power and GSM signal. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/69b/b0d/b0d/69bb0db0d23d4d4a943b42615706e890.jpg"><br><br>  Behind the information about the device and small TTX. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a37/6ec/19a/a376ec19a7234111a86317cdb75c1a18.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/381/bb7/335/381bb7335bb14908a6f44523ca4c0038.jpg"><br><br>  We insert the SIM card into the slot, and the device into the outlet. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/73f/ac0/e74/73fac0e749744e3981e4461f24ecea6b.jpg"><br><br>  Our smart socket immediately begins to search for a GSM network and register in it, after a successful registration a single squeak occurs.  Next, the outlet must be set up by sending an SMS like # 0 # to its number. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/034/db3/8ac/034db38ac6ba4e3584f12721d563e68c.jpg"><br><br>  This is necessary so that the main control number is added to the device‚Äôs memory. <br><br>  The socket receiving SMS, also gives a sound signal, and at the time of receipt, the network indicator also flashes. <br><br>  Since the balance of the SIM card was 0, then the response SMS was not sent to the socket, but it registered the number.  I learned this after replenishing the balance sent a second command. <br>  The socket answered that the number is already registered. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/db9/41a/26e/db941a26ed2940388a4749eac13f0e2d.jpg"><br><br>  In general, the instructions have a lot of commands for SMS, but teaching them and typing is not very interesting, I would even say uncomfortable.  For these purposes, Telemetrika released an application available in the Play Store and the Apple Store. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c64/760/1e9/c647601e9f2c45bd807c810ef07118ee.jpg"><br><br>  It is universal for Telemetry products and is suitable not only for the outlet.  In addition, it is also very simple.  The application just sends SMS for you.  Answers from devices also come to you in the form of SMS, the application does not display them in any way, this is just the ‚Äúsender‚Äù of commands. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/827/612/dc2/827612dc24da478fb6ba0d3b93cae2f7.jpg"><br><br>  When you first start and add a device, the program registers the main number, to which the socket naturally responds that they say I‚Äôve been a long time ago, just damn it. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/6f7/399/263/6f73992631af48d49a7a03bd320cd481.jpg"><br><br>  Further, the application offers to send SMS to check the status. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/9b5/474/ca2/9b5474ca245c4a01aa86b10acea7b473.jpg"><br><br>  After these two procedures, the socket appears in the device list. <br><br>  But despite the fact that the application very simply interacts with the outlet, it has quite good functionality for converting your desires for managing devices into teams. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/987/10c/32b/98710c32b27a4e279d97a4e200a6cd46.jpg"><br><br>  For example, scheduled control. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/5ae/e61/26c/5aee6126c59d40d094b55cd50e42b9f1.jpg"><br><br>  Or control by temperature or timer. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/aee/ee3/dfe/aeeee3dfe49044a58b2f4fbf6e6560ed.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ddd/a00/df3/ddda00df3ce046358a74f1cc5ccfac5f.jpg"><br><br>  You can also simply monitor the temperature; in this mode, the socket will send ambient temperature information from the sensor to the selected time interval. <br><br>  If you connect a small heater to an outlet, for example, you can warm up a country house for your arrival, or rather a small part of it.  Or make these outlets a few. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/800/9fd/b04/8009fdb0425745dd8e4f0fac96f5262d.jpg"><br><br>  With heaters you need to be careful.  The socket is set to 16A relay, as described below.  Just do not overload the outlet, otherwise it will cheerfully inform you that it has become very hot in the house, and then about disconnecting 220V to the mains. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/cb1/696/745/cb16967455604f049a49bee20939cfcf.jpg"><br><br>  As a matter of fact, I tested the outlet while on a regular light bulb. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c36/3e5/c54/c363e5c5443c4009a051336325c7d51a.jpg"><br><br>  Here the socket is on, the lamp is on. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/72b/d07/3f1/72bd073f1b3240059f5227b78799dfb1.jpg"><br><br>  But already off.  It's simple. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/687/169/a23/687169a23b0d46b5839878b9f24b5029.jpg"><br><br>  Why, in the age of ubiquitous WiFi Internet, the socket is made in the form factor GSM? <br>  Everything is simple, this device is designed primarily where there is no this very Internet.  The GSM signal is more profitable than the Internet in the form of WiFi and even GPRS.  He is able to break into the wilderness, where, for example, is your summer cottage, far from the city, and control your devices. <br><br>  Comparing it with home-made automated sockets, for example, the well-known Xiaomi or early versions of kankun. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b4f/6c8/fd7/b4f6c8fd76fc4c41b373488d5ec4fbb3.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/441/3ed/21f/4413ed21f87046a1a62c58dd07fc330d.jpg"><br><br>  You understand that they look more profitable against the background of GSM sockets and give more functionality.  But they have a number of limitations in the form of not always Russified and even anglicised software, non-standard connectors for our types and sometimes binding only to Chinese servers. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/195/dd3/bf5/195dd3bf5a0f4e588f01a1b7d30d3ba1.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/1de/84f/6be/1de84f6be7b94a069f96557c520b1695.jpg"><br><br>  In principle, it would be possible to replace such an outlet with a simple timer with a schedule function. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/1c3/db7/7a3/1c3db77a3740467a915f4fbf0b7b9899.jpg"><br><br>  But he has no feedback and does not have a temperature sensor extending functionality. <br>  So, for giving or a country house, where there is no permanent Internet, this is a great option. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e79/9d6/2bd/e799d62bd5de4f128d87efd4ebfa4db6.jpg"><br><br>  With the use of clear, now look inside. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f15/49d/662/f1549d6620e1487b93af6a5ce60bde45.jpg"><br><br>  We take out four silicone pins and snap off the front cover.  It holds an additional two clips in the center. <br><br>  A plate was found on the cover, this is how GSM antenna is implemented. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/fde/bb2/f30/fdebb2f304a04908bf84f596fe611889.jpg"><br><br>  Then you can see the board with the main brains and battery connector.  There is a battery that allows you to send SMS when power is lost in the network.  The socket works independently for several minutes without external power. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/8c6/df1/6e7/8c6df16e752147fbac499b5e7abe5a04.jpg"><br><br>  Further, under the main board for an additional plastic shield, there is a separate board that works with the high-voltage part.  electronics is divided and right. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/bdd/833/a4d/bdd833a4d7a34a379387bad04828990e.jpg"><br><br>  Unscrew the two screws and see what's inside. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a77/29d/dc3/a7729ddc31ea47878df98bb7e19db432.jpg"><br><br>  And here is the relay.  For those who understand these types of relays, I propose to express their expert opinion on the maximum power that should be switched to this outlet. <br><br>  <b>Findings:</b> <br><br>  Pros: <br>  - independence of the Internet <br>  - mobility <br>  - expansion of functionality due to temperature sensor <br><br>  Minuses: <br>  - you need to have a separate SIM card and monitor the balance <br>  - not the smallest device size <br><br>  For those who want to buy this outlet, we remind you that this can be done at a discount using the promotional code: GEEKT-TELE <br><br>  The socket itself is sold under the link: <a href="https://dadget.ru/katalog/dom-i-dacha/distancionnaja-rozetka/%3Futm_referrer%3Dgeektimes.ru%26utm_source%3Dgeektimes.ru%26utm_medium%3Darticle%26utm_term%3Ddistancionnaja-rozetka%26utm_content%3Ddistancionnaja-rozetka%26utm_campaign%3Ddistancionnaja-rozetka_312">Telemetrika GSM socket</a> <br><br>  Also, the company ‚ÄúDadzhet‚Äù is interested in publishing independent objective reviews of dadzhetov in various media.  The company ‚ÄúDjadzhet‚Äù will gladly provide dadzhetov bloggers and authors who want to test them and write a review.  The device after writing a review remains with the author.  The company is not trying to tell the author what to write about our product, but asks to show the article before publication.  In this case, it is possible to clarify information and prevent errors.  Whether to consider company comments or not is always up to the discretion of the author.  <a href="https://dadget.ru/cooperation">Read more ...</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/397443/">https://habr.com/ru/post/397443/</a></p>
