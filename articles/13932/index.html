  <section class="page js-page"><h1>10 Tips for Productive Work at Home</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  I recently translated Darren Rose's article ‚Äú <a href="http://www.readmymind.ru/produktivnost-raboty-blogera">Productivity of a blogger</a> ‚Äù and apparently didn‚Äôt express my opinion on this article because I was asked to talk about what specific steps I intend to take to improve the quality of work on my blog. <br>  <strong>What I do for more productive work:</strong> <br><ol><li>  <strong>I am making a list of cases.</strong>  Without a list of tasks that you must decide, just can not do.  This has been said many times already and was said unknowingly.  I like it more when this list is not in the computer, but in a special notebook (ksati now I‚Äôll get a special notebook for this case, otherwise I‚Äôm writing anywhere).  When the to-do list is in the notebook, you can always put it in front of you and see what you need to do now, this is more convenient than looking for it on your computer.  The highest priority tasks need to be allocated, and the completed ones should be deleted.  Usually, I make a list of tasks in the evening, so that the next morning I can already see what needs to be done for that day. </li><li>  <strong>Make a list of future posts.</strong>  Many bloggers do it.  When the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãa future post comes to mind, it needs to be entered in your list.  Someone keeps a list of future posts on the computer, and for this I started an invisible page on the blog, accessible only to me.  As needed, I look there and update. </li><li>  <strong>Write a blog every day.</strong>  This does not mean that you need to write gosnoposta, just to be.  It is necessary to write every day useful.  It's not that difficult, considering that I have a list of what I'm going to write about.  You just need to select from the list of future posts the one that you most want to implement at the moment.  Of course, there are days when I do not write anything new, but they are rarely. </li><li>  <strong>Write down interesting thoughts.</strong>  Usually, when I go to bed, I do not fall asleep right away, but mentally summarize the results of the day, and it is here that interesting ideas come to mind about what can be written on a blog or how to improve it.  It has been noticed that ideas come to my mind at bedtime and while writing posts.  And to you?  I do not hope for my memory, because by the morning it will most likely be forgotten.  I write down all the useful ideas in a notebook.  It is better to get up and write down the idea, than to try to remember it and never remember, biting your elbows. </li><li>  <strong>I solve priority tasks during the highest productivity.</strong>  Someone owl, someone lark, someone easier to work before lunch, and someone after.  It is easier for me to work after lunch (after about 14 o'clock in the afternoon), so I put aside the most difficult tasks for this time.  Difficult tasks are translation of a regular article or writing a labor-intensive post.  The rest of the time I work on making it easier, for example, writing comments on other blogs or simple posts in my own. </li><li>  <strong>Not all the work - and you can play.</strong>  It is hard to constantly work, and after dinner you also want to sleep.  But the time when you want to sleep can be used, for example, to play.  Surely many people tend to sleep after you have lunch, and if you fall asleep, you can sleep through the hour and a half, and this is a bunch of time spent.  It is better to play 30-40 minutes in some non-stressful game, such as a shooter or racing.  I'm playing Xpand Rally Xtreme now.  This is not a game that delays like Gothic, so you can play it for half an hour and turn it off.  Sleep already hassle and you can continue to work. </li><li>  <strong>Save time.</strong>  No, I do not brush my teeth while doing exercises, I do it in turn.  But I sleep less (although under my working conditions I could sleep 10 hours a day), I try not to be distracted while working - this is some kind of time saving.  There are figures who advise you to do several things at the same time, I don‚Äôt listen to them - I save on another.  But you may need their advice. </li><li>  <strong>All in order.</strong>  If you don‚Äôt do one thing, you don‚Äôt need to move on to another - this way you lose focus and rhythm of work, productivity decreases and you don‚Äôt have time for what you‚Äôve planned.  You deal with one problem and you will have more strength to solve the others, so everything must be solved in order and proceed to another task only by solving the previous one.  Of course, if you have all the data to solve the current problem, if there is no data, then you need to wait for it to appear, and in order not to wait in vain do something else. </li><li>  <strong>I adopt the experience of other people.</strong>  It is not difficult to find information on how to organize your working time, this has been written many times by literate people, such as Steve Pavlina.  Translations of some of his articles can be found <a href="http://stevepavlina.malira.ru/">here</a> .  I am not yet an expert on the organization of effective work, so I have something to learn from more experienced people. </li><li>  <strong>Use the diary to record what takes time.</strong>  When I was still working for Russian information, we had a system of weekly reports on the work done.  It was necessary to paint in time what you are doing during the week, and then report to the boss at the planning meeting.  It was very inconvenient to write down my work on a notebook in hours, because it was difficult to compile a report for the week using paper data, and it took me 2 hours to do it.  Therefore, I phased out a small thing on PHP, in which I entered the data on the work done, these records were stored in the database, and then I could automatically get a report for the past week. <br>  So when you do not write, what takes you time, you can not control it and understand where it goes.  Certainly they often noticed that the day had passed, and what was wasted time was not clear.  Making temporary reports, you can see what takes you time and how to use it properly.  You will see what you have done in a day and if you didn‚Äôt waste time on nonsense, you will gain strength from the awareness of work efficiency.  In addition, hourly reports just make you more responsible to yourself, do not allow to waste time.  Use the electronic diary. </li></ol><br><br>  <a href="http://www.readmymind.ru/10-sovetov-produktivnoj-raboty-doma/">Original source</a> </div>
