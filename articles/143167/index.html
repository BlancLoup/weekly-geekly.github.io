  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Evernote Dev Meetup Moscow Results</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  On April 27, we held a meeting with developers in Moscow on the integration of applications and services with Evernote. <br><br>  During the event, we examined both the promotion of partner products and the possibilities of the Evernote API to expand their functionality.  Also at Evernote Dev Meetup, several existing Evernote partners told about their integration experience. <br><br>  We want to thank everyone who was able to attend our event.  We hope you enjoyed it and the meeting turned out to be useful.  To those who could not meet with us, we will discuss the topics covered by the speakers below.

    <img src="http://blog.evernote.com/ru/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/image01.jpg" title="image01" width="597" height="402"><br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h3>  Evernote Ecosystem and Affiliate Product Promotion Channels </h3><br>  Dmitry Stavisky, vice president of international development for Evernote, spoke about how our service has grown since the end of 2010.  The number of users has grown from 6 million to 25 million people.  The number of active users increased 4.5 times - up to 9 million.  Every day about 65 thousand people get an account in Evernote.  The number of premium users is 900 thousand people. <br><br><img src="http://blog.evernote.com/ru/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/image02.png" title="image02" width="600" height="334"><br><br>  Dmitry also demonstrated the distribution of users by country, platform and the number of Evernote clients used.  In particular, he noted that we have become an international company from an American company - less than a third of users already account for the USA.  At the same time, the share of the audience in China is growing rapidly.  At the same time, Dmitry drew attention to the fact that Evernote offers developers access not only to the Russian, but also to the global multi-million service audience in many countries. <br><br><img src="http://blog.evernote.com/ru/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/image03.png" title="image03" width="600" height="594"><br><br>  The report noted a marked increase in the use of mobile platforms.  Now in the world we have 33.9% of iOS, 26% - on Android.  In Russia, the situation is somewhat different - the share of Android and Windows is greater, but the trend of ‚Äúmobilizing‚Äù users is similar. <br><br>  Interestingly, the number of users who use Evernote on only one platform is growing.  This is due to the growing popularity of our service in developing countries, where a mobile phone remains the main window for Internet access.  However, 33% of our users use three or more Evernote clients on various platforms. <br><br><img src="http://blog.evernote.com/ru/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/image00.png" title="image00" width="600" height="367"><br><br>  As for the use of our Evernote API, for all the time of its existence, we have received more than 9,000 applications from developers, more than 1,200 integrations have already been implemented and presented on the market.  250 selected partner projects are presented in the Evernote Gallery. <br><br>  For the developer, integration with Evernote is useful in that it gives him access to the user audience and the ability to use the information accumulated by users to provide them with new functionality and services.  Also in Evernote provides a program that allows developers to receive a portion of the income when attracted by their users purchase a premium subscription. <br><br>  Of course, Evernote also provides marketing support for affiliate applications.  We help promote these products through ads inside our applications, tell users about them on newsletters and social networks, we ensure the interest of large media and presence at events and conferences.  We also regularly supplement our <a href="http://evernote.com/intl/ru/trunk/">Evernote Gallery</a> with excellent partner solutions. <br><br>  For Evernote, partners are important, first of all, because they allow to provide users with a huge amount of additional features that could not be realized with the help of their own resources.  When you have tens of millions of users, you not only cannot fulfill all their wishes, but you can‚Äôt even guess about all the needs, and here we very much count on our partners. <br><br>  <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/evernote_ru/evernote-12768144">View Dmitry Stavisky‚Äôs Evernote Ecosystem Presentation ¬ª</a> <br><br><h3>  Resources, API, applications </h3><br>  Igor Afanasyev, manager of the Russian-language service Evernote, spoke about the technical capabilities of the service in terms of integration with other products.  He also mentioned our new developer site <a href="http://dev.evernote.com/">dev.evernote.com</a> , which provides an overview of the capabilities of our API with complete documentation on it, videos, news, and sample applications.  Separately, he noted that we provide Russian-speaking technical support for developers.  To appeal, simply click on the ‚ÄúFeedback‚Äù tab on any page of our website and select the ‚ÄúEvernote API‚Äù section. <br><br>  Igor told that we provide two types of API: local - at the level of individual platforms and the ‚Äúcloudy‚Äù cross-platform. <br><br><img src="http://blog.evernote.com/ru/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/image04.png" title="image04" width="400" height="271"><br><br>  The local API is specific for each platform (Windows, Android, Mac) and allows you to create notes from text, HTML and images, as well as receive data from devices - from scanners and cameras to GPS trackers and ensure import / export of data in various formats.  The advantages of the local API are the ability to work without the Internet, as well as the need to authorize the user. <br><br>  Cross-platform API involves online interaction directly with the server, includes libraries for the main programming languages, including C ++, C #, Objective-C, Perl, Python, Java and others.  Cross-platform API can be used in any web services and local applications. <br><br>  During the report, Igor highlighted all the main issues that arise for developers who are just familiar with our API: he told about the procedure for obtaining our API key, authorization options (normal and OAuth), the policy of granting rights to work with users' notes.  He paid special attention to the Thrift framework used in our API, the features of working with synchronization and subscription to certain notes.  He also mentioned our note markup language - ENML and the ability to use thumbnails for user-generated images.  All these points are described in sufficient detail in the presentation. <br><br>  <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/evernote_ru/api-12756806">View Igor Afanasyev‚Äôs Evernote API presentation ¬ª</a> <br><br><h3>  Partners </h3><br>  In addition to representatives of Evernote, partners who have already integrated their products with Evernote and spoke in their speeches about the integration process and its effectiveness made presentations at the meeting. <br><br>  IOS application developer <strong>Gleb Tarasov</strong> , the author of <b><a href="http://itunes.apple.com/ru/app/iguides/id467633606%3Fmt%3D8">iGuides</a></b> mobile client, spoke about the simple implementation of exporting information, news and other content to Evernote and other projects using the ShareKit library.  To emphasize the speed of this integration, Gleb right at the time of the report created a test application with a button, which, when pressed, sent text, images and HTML to Evernote. <br><br>  <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/evernote_ru/evernote-ios-sharekit">View Gleb Tarasov‚Äôs presentation on ShareKit library ¬ª</a> <br><br>  <strong>Nina Grigorieva,</strong> co-founder of <strong><a href="http://news360.ru/">News360,</a></strong> spoke about her service, which gained great popularity abroad (the service is designed for English-speaking users).  The essence of News360 is to present to the user a unique, news image of the day, formed for him.  Client service applications are available for all major platforms.  To better define the user's preferences, News360 analyzes its Evernote notes and builds the corresponding graph of interests, based on which the news is then selected. <br><br>  <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/evernote_ru/news360evernoteinterest-graph">View Nina Grigorieva's presentation on the integration of News360 and Evernote ¬ª</a> <br><br>  <strong><a href="http://www.yamlabs.com/">Parallel</a></strong> <strong>Vakhitov</strong> , CTO of <strong><a href="http://www.yamlabs.com/">yaM,</a></strong> completed a series of partnership speeches.  This service serves as a platform for working meetings and meetings, allowing you to record all the information relating to the meeting.  The minutes of such a meeting can be sent to Evernote. <br><br>  <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/evernote_ru/yam-and-evernote">View the presentation of Pavel Vakhitov about the integration of yaM and Evernote ¬ª</a> <br><br>  At the end of the meeting, Igor Afanasyev announced our competition for Evernote Devcup developers, in which you can take part now.  We offer software developers and designers to come up with and implement interesting applications and services that will allow 25 million Evernote users to expand the capabilities of their accounts.  The prize fund of the competition is more than $ 100,000, and the finalists will get a chance to present their work at the Evernote Trunk Conference event this year in San Francisco.  More information about the competition we have already written in the <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/evernote/blog/142775/">blog</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/143167/">https://habr.com/ru/post/143167/</a></p>
