      CMV usually lies dormant and harmless in the body, but can cause infections, including viral cardiac infections.  Viruses spread by contact with body fluids of an infected person.  They can also be transmitted from a pregnant woman to the fetus during pregnancy. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24965794">Rapamycin causes diabetes in mice</a> .  So the cause of diabetes is to look in our immune system.  In viruses? <br><br>  Next will be described diseases and the following viruses, possibly causing them: <br>  Epstein ‚Äì Barr virus (EBV), also called herpesvirus 4 (HHV-4) <br>  Cytomegalovirus (CMV), also called herpesvirus 5 (HHV-5) <br>  Varicella zoster virus (VZV), also called herpesvirus 3 (HHV-3) <br>  Herpes simplex virus-1 (HSV-1) <br>  Herpes simplex virus-2 (HSV-2) <br><br><h2>  Alzheimer's Syndrome </h2><br>  CA is a complex neurodegenerative disease leading to irreversible loss of neurons, intellectual abilities, memory and reasoning ability. <br>  Chronic inflammation is considered a cause of chronic diseases, <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/cen3.12454">including Alzheimer's disease.</a> <br>  CMV is present in a very high proportion of patients with vascular dementia in the brain ( <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed%3FDb%3Dpubmed%26Cmd%3DShowDetailView%26TermToSearch%3D11848687">Lin et al., 2002</a> ) <br><br>  <a href="https://www.cell.com/neuron/fulltext/S0896-6273(18)30526-9">Our findings show a simple and direct mechanism</a> by which herpes infections cause precipitation of brain amyloid as a protective response in the brain, explains one of the researchers, Rudolf Tanzi from MassGeneral Institute for Neurodegenerative Disease (MIND). <br>  Beta amyloid in the brain specifically wraps herpes particles to prevent them from spreading! <br><br>  "Thus, we have combined the infection hypothesis and the amyloid hypothesis into one hypothesis about the antimicrobial response from Alzheimer's disease." <br><br>  Based on past research, scientists chose herpes simplex 1 (HSV-1) and herpes virus 6 (HHV-6) as probable contenders for communication with Alzheimer's - HSV-1 is a virus that, by the way, causes herpes. <br><br>  Experiments not only showed that viral infections lead to more beta-amyloid deposits, mice diluted with human-like AŒ≤ were better able to fight off the damage to HSV-1, suggesting that these proteins (amyloid) are indeed a kind of counter-attack. <br><br>  This is also <a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/herpes-has-been-linked-to-alzheimer-s-reigniting-a-controversial-hypothesis-about-the-disease">consistent</a> with studies published just a few weeks ago that showed higher levels of herpes viruses in the brains of people who died from Alzheimer's disease. <br><br><h2>  Cardiovascular diseases </h2><br>  Herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) has been recognized as a potential causative agent of cardiovascular disease.  The presence of antibodies to HSV-1 has been reported to be associated with an increased risk of myocardial infarction and ischemic heart disease. <br><br>  Previous studies have shown that people who have had a positive <a href="">CMV</a> test are at <a href="">a higher risk</a> for heart disease and are not dependent on other risk factors. <br><br>  There is growing evidence that chronic <a href="">infection is associated with atherosclerosis</a> .  Specific organisms, including herpes viruses, increase atherosclerosis in a mouse with apolipoprotein E (ApoE) <br><br>  Thirty-seven percent of those studied (142 of 381) were CMV-seropositive.  These people had a higher body mass index (1 kg / m2) and systolic blood pressure (3 mmHg), but lower levels of LDL cholesterol (0.2 mmol / l) when measured by age, sex, and diabetes.  There were no differences in the values ‚Äã‚Äãof C-reactive protein (CRP), hemoglobin A1C levels (7%). <br><br>  Fifty-eight percent of those studied (220 out of 379) were HSV-positive.  These people had a higher body mass index (2 kg / m2) and systolic blood pressure (4 mmHg. Above), adjusted for age, gender and diabetes.  Unlike CMV, those who were seropositive for HSV had significantly higher C-reactive protein values. <br><br>  Coronary artery calcification and CMV / HSV <br>  CMV-positive individuals had a 1.5-fold odds ratio for the presence of calcification compared with the seronegative group.  A similar minor relationship was observed between HSV-positive serology and calcification. <br><br>  The results also show that previous CMV infection may be associated with an increase in atherosclerotic load, which is assessed by examining coronary artery calcification.  In contrast, there was no statistically significant independent relationship between HSV, H pylori, C pneumoniae and vascular dysfunction. <br><br>  These results complement the work with mice with ApoE deficiency, in which mouse gammaherpervirus-682 and mouse cytomegalovirus 3 amplify atheroma, but not HSV-1.  And consistent with the clinical evidence that CMV, but not HSV-1, is associated with atherosclerosis. <br><br><h2>  Type 2 diabetes </h2><br>  Type 2 diabetes mellitus is a metabolic disorder characterized by high blood glucose levels due to insulin deficiency or resistance. <br><br>  Researchers surveyed more than 500 people in the late 80s.  Of those who had CMV, 17% also had type 2 diabetes. Among those who never had CMV, only 8% had diabetes. <br><br>  Here is <a href="http://care.diabetesjournals.org/content/28/2/435">another study</a> <br>  Among the 1 566 subjects, 206 (13.2%) had type 2 diabetes, and 1360 patients were non-diabetic.  In patients over the age of 65, arterial hypertension and coronary artery disease were more common in patients with diabetes than in controls (all P &lt;0.05).  The prevalence of HSV-1 infection was significantly higher in the diabetic than the control group (46.1 versus 36.3%), <br><br>  This conclusion is not consistent with the suggestion that diabetes leads to HSV-1 infection, because among several pathogens that are believed to be involved in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular diseases, only HSV-1 infection, that is, not Chlamydia pneumonia, cytomegalovirus or HSV -2 are associated with type 2 diabetes. <br><br><h2>  Type 1 diabetes </h2><br>  Type 1 diabetes develops as a two-step process.  First, a person acquires antibodies against the cells in the pancreas that are responsible for producing insulin, a hormone that allows cells to absorb sugar from the bloodstream so that they can burn it for energy.  Some children generate antibodies, called auto-antibodies, because they target human cells, but never develop the disease. <br><br>  In other children, however, auto-antibodies signal a progressive attack of the body‚Äôs own immune system against pancreatic cells, killing them and hindering the body‚Äôs ability to produce insulin.  When the pancreas can no longer produce enough insulin, a person develops type 1 diabetes. <br><br>  <a href="https://medicine.wustl.edu/news/diabetes-risk-linked-to-intestinal-viruses/">Researchers also found differences in a group of viruses, called bacteriophages, that infect bacteria in the intestines, and not in human cells.</a>  Children carrying bacteriophages that target Bacteroides species, one of the main groups of intestinal bacteria, are more likely to start on the road to diabetes. <br><br>  ‚ÄúPrevious studies have shown that changes in Bacteroides species are associated with the development of type 1 diabetes, and here we found that viruses that infect bacteroids are associated with the development of autoantibodies,‚Äù said Deva, who is also a professor of molecular microbiology and medicine.  "Our results support the idea that bacteriids or other bacteria and viruses that infect them play a role in the pathological process that leads to diabetes." <br><br>  Viruses can cause type 1 and type 2 diabetes because they <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-5410031/Diabetes-triggered-virus-scientists-warn.html">contain proteins that mimic insulin</a> , an unexpected discovery. <br><br>  Researchers at Harvard University have discovered that four types of viruses produce proteins that mimic insulin, which can lead to diabetes in people exposed to microorganisms. <br><br><h4>  Long-livers </h4><br>  It is worth exploring centenarians for the presence of herpes, cytomegalovirus, Epstein-Barr virus and varicella-zoster virus in their bodies! <br><br><h2>  Symptoms </h2><br>  Since many viral infections do not create visible symptoms, the infection may go unnoticed. <br><br>  For some people, the only sign of a viral illness is flu symptoms. <br><br>  Signs that may occur include: <br><br>  abnormal heartbeat <br>  chest pain <br>  fatigue <br>  fever <br>  muscle pain <br>  sore throat <br>  joint or leg pain or swelling <br>  fainting or shortness of breath <br><br><h2>  Treatment </h2><br>  Epstein - Barr virus (human herpes virus type 4) - not treated, only the symptoms are removed. <br><br>  Adults with chickenpox take acyclovir tablets at a dosage of 800 mg five times each day. <br><br>  Treatment for a viral infection may include medications, such as antivirals for treating the infection: <br><br><ul><li>  acyclovir </li><li>  valacyclovir </li><li>  famciclovir </li><li>  penciclovir </li><li>  docosanol </li></ul><br>  A mild cytomegalovirus infection is usually not treated, or take valganciclovir, ganciclovir, cidofovir, foscarnet, or a combination. <br><br><ul><li>  Lysine - Increasing cellular lysine concentration upsets the balance of HSV between lysine and arginine and inhibits viral replication. </li><li>  Doctors may also recommend certain lifestyle changes, such as eating a low-salt diet and reducing activity. </li><li>  Also, work on bacterial protection against viruses is carried out all over the world. Today, it has been proven that the introduction of symbiotic streptococcus bacteria into the human body leads to a sharp decrease in the viral load on the body. </li></ul></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/419241/">https://habr.com/ru/post/419241/</a></p>
