  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Real life</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  All week Pasha plowed like a damn: lessons at school, housework, homework.  And having done the main thing, he also solved problems of increased complexity in mathematics and read the novel that will be in the program on literature only next month.  Even the little sister from the kindergarten was contracted to pick up.  Pasha was for what, Pasha tried.  In the end, the parents said that his behavior would determine the issue with access to the computer at the weekend.  If he does everything right, he will not see any computer for two whole days. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  It all started a long time ago - at the beginning of the XXI century, people who began to have a social network account were considered suspicious.  Over time, the term ‚Äúsuspicious‚Äù grew into a ‚Äúsocially dangerous‚Äù, and with a series of laws ‚ÄúOn compulsory registration of citizens in social networks‚Äù, not having an account there became a crime.  Since most people already had it, the law was passed by the public calmly - well, a passport or birth certificate was obligatory before that - and now also a social profile.  network will be.  So what?  Conveniently even.  With a few dissatisfied people, they quickly got through with fines, forced registration, and Pasha had already received his page right on the day of birth.  "Created by the bot of the maternity hospital ‚Ññ3 of the city of N-ska".  And a photo of my mother in her arms.  Well, okay.  The trouble was different. <br><br>  In the middle of the twentieth century it was a shame to be illiterate, at the beginning of the twenty-first it was a shame not to be able to use a computer or mobile phone.  People without these skills could not count on the respect of others, on any serious career or a good salary.  Now it was a shame not to be an active unit of the network society.  And this was not only about common things - to be ‚Äúsocial‚Äù now meant ‚Äúto be aware of absolutely everything.‚Äù  Discussions of news and videos, popular bloggers and memes, demotivators and trends, fakes and viral ads, games and flash mobs, and much, much more.  Total sociality somehow automatically began to imply intolerance towards those who did not enjoy it. <br><br>  ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt know why these five people are so idiot jerking to stupid music in strange costumes ?!  So you missed a new video on YouTube, which has been tearing up all the ratings for 2 days already!  So it's you two days, it turns out, did not read anything on the web?  Maybe sick?  There is just so?  You are strange.  You are suspicious.  You are not ours.  You are a stranger. "

      But society does not like strangers.  Alien - the enemy.  And anyone who doesn‚Äôt want to be an enemy - he has to open every day these, these and these sites, press F5, read, watch, like, comment.  Be aware of.  In the know of everything. <br><br>  Pasha was angry.  He believed that he could live without it with his mind and with his own forces.  He studied very well.  He read a lot.  He was preparing for olympiads and entering the university.  Parents were happy for Pasha, proud of him.  But every day they repeated the same thing to him: ‚ÄúIf you are not up to date on the web, you will never become‚Äú yours ‚Äùto anyone.  You will not find friends, you will not get a good job, you will not create a family.  What then is the use of all your knowledge and your whole mind? ‚Äù  That was the point.  And Pasha, having done his homework, with a sigh set aside such a fascinating volume of quantum physics and opened his page on the social network.  The one that has been attacked by fresh jokes, cute seals, and where, through the efforts of the community, the most fashionable today video from YouTube is sure to be shown.  Pasha understood that without this there was no way. <br><br>  The truth is sometimes - in honor of the birthday, well, or very great success in school, parents allowed a day or two not to do it.  This, of course, was very harmful, but if only sometimes, as an exception, only for a while, then that would be okay.  Therefore, Pasha and tried.  If everything works out, tomorrow it will be possible to take a ball in the closet, go out into the yard and drive it through the grassy yard for a while.  They say that once it was possible to do this even in a company with several other guys - this game was called, it seems, ‚Äúfootball‚Äù or something similar.  But in the Pashkin yard others like him were not.  Yes, and throughout the city, most likely, too.  Peers had no time: videos, pictures, jokes, quotes, statuses, likes, dislikes, seals, comments.  Real life. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/170093/">https://habr.com/ru/post/170093/</a></p>
