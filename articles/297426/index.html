Memo novice web developer, or why ...". <br><br>  I will insert my 5 kopecks - the answer to the <a href="http://megamozg.ru/post/22816/">manifest</a> .  This is not exactly a praise ode, but it will lighten up the teaching profession a little and reassure newly minted assistants and associate professors <s>who, probably, updated their shortcuts and rolled Corvalol.</s>  At the moment I am an assistant of one of the Russian universities, before that almost 4 years of work at various enterprises, i.e.  I appreciate on both sides of the barricades. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><h5>  <b>Psychological compatibility</b> </h5><br><blockquote>  My advice: if you are an introvert, then run away from this work where your eyes are </blockquote>  But where to run?  It's horrible!  But people are everywhere!  And as an engineer, people surrounded me at least 8 hours a day!  The teacher took the pair, the rest of the day sitting with papers.  Where it is more convenient: at the department, at home, in the library.  I check at home and on the way to the university, sitting in public transport.  To maintain peace of mind, reduce the noise in their classes to a minimum, discipline to the maximum and do not forget about subordination.  About this below. <br>  Introvert non-teacher gentlemen, where do you put all people?  The author did not mean a remote or freelance, probably because  he also expressed the problem of the complexity of the clientele search.

    <h5>  <b>Load</b> </h5><br>  Probably depends on the university.  But those with whom I had to face, had the opportunity to take part time. <blockquote>  common occurrence when one teacher leads from five to ten different subjects </blockquote>  Not!  This is not a common occurrence!  In normative documents this is stipulated!  How does the head of the department react to this?  And those who made up such a load?  If you admit this as a teacher, then there is no guarantee that this will pass you through in other professional activities. <br>  Working in the university, we ourselves form half of our working time.  Couples and consultations keep in tone and graphics;  further anywhere and somehow.  After couples you can sleep, cross-stitch, walk, and work with papers at night. <br><br><h5>  <b>Salary.</b>  <b>Part-time and part-time job</b> </h5><br>  Alas.  Salary is a sore point.  Firstly, universities do not take part-time jobs.  - depends on the university.  But the key point is that one teacher s / n lives either the one who arranges everything for a number of reasons, or a whiner.  Almost the entire teaching staff is engaged in something parallel.  Someone has a connection with the real sector (this, by the way, is useful both in terms of money and the opportunity to observe how everything really is; students enjoy real production stories), someone publishes, many take an extra rate (optional). in the same university), freelancing.  There is just a lot more opportunity to cheat, rather than when you work from a call to a call to somewhere in production. <blockquote>  Finally, a side job.  This means tutoring, assistance in writing graduation and term papers.  Yes, some people manage to earn so little.  But again, everything depends on the availability of this time, as well as customers.  It is noticed that while you are a student yourself, you get such a part-time job regularly, and as soon as you become a teacher, everything gradually disappears somewhere. </blockquote>  You must declare yourself, advertise.  No one will know about your tutoring if you sit down and wait, and when will old student ties shoot out.  There are lots of sites where you can offer your services.  More experience - you want more.  Well, everywhere, yes?  About the experience below. <br><br><h5>  <b>Career</b> </h5><br>  Whatever position you hold, the essence of the work will be about the same.  And again I want to ask the author - but where should I go for a steep career growth?  In absolutely any job, if you don‚Äôt work properly, you won‚Äôt be at least 50 years old.  And in absolutely any job you do about the same throughout your career.  In a university, you are probably not a position, but you earn prestige and a name.  Publish, go to expert advice, advise, engage in science, do not forget to advertise yourself.  And you will be welcome everywhere and always and not for free.  Another conversation is that not everyone can do it, but you can already evaluate yourself in the process of studying in graduate school, this is a question of ambition. <br><br><h5>  <b>Scientific work</b> </h5><br><blockquote>  The first thing I want to say is: I don‚Äôt know a single teacher who would write a dissertation, working as a teacher at the same time </blockquote>  - and I want to say that a thesis is almost impossible to write when you work somewhere on the side.  You can, of course, idealize as much as you like and dream that you will be sponsoring for 3 years, and you will give birth to scientific work and spend days and nights in libraries and experiments, but I don‚Äôt have a single such example.  But working as a teacher you have the time and opportunity to attend defenses / competitions / conferences;  in order to get to the library you do not need to go through the whole city, it is enough to climb / descend to the required floor;  consultation is many times easier, and not only from your own teacher.  If we talk about the difficulties on the defense itself - to you a fundamentally different attitude.  If you work in the same university, you are ‚Äúyours‚Äù.  Own do not hurt. <br><br><h5>  <b>Financing</b> </h5><br>  Depends on the university and the degree of whining.  Do not finance the university, but you are a cool scientist or methodologist?  Look for grants, prizes and sponsors, participate in contests.  Difficult and lazy - sit on the salary.  So everywhere.  In any field in life. <br><br><h5>  <b>The difference in age with students.</b>  <b>Lateness</b> </h5><br>  I find in the small difference in age (we have a difference of less than 10 years with them) advantages.  Remember how awkward it was to ask questions at times?  Or was it just me?  What if the question is stupid?  What if the teacher will make me laugh?  What if everyone understood, and I alone do not?  I do not hesitate to ask even the most "stupid" questions.  They learn, but they know that I study too.  We are equal.  BUT <blockquote>  here you get an unmanaged audience, some of which appeal to you on you, and in general, leads cheekily, as in your yard </blockquote>  - if your students wipe their feet about you, if you cannot observe subordination, then in <b>any team there is a</b> high probability that colleagues will not respect you, they will sit on your neck and hang your legs.  Are you boss?  Expect your subordinates to wipe their feet on you too. <br>  Anyway, regardless of age, you are higher than students by status.  If you, a young teacher, are spitting now, the situation will not change no matter how old you are and what profession you choose in the future. <br><br><h5>  <b>High and light.</b>  <b>Competence</b> </h5><br><blockquote>  Here you need to understand and not to forget that you are not an authority for students, and it is useless to read morality. </blockquote>  Did you come to read morality or your subject?  Morales are generally useless to read to <b>any</b> sexually mature person.  In any group there will be as well as interested as well as hackers and "prisoners from the army."  Focus on those who are interested.  I give all my students to understand: not interested, stay at home;  I will not be punished for me personally, handing over the homework.  Or sit on the back of the desk and silently go about your business.  And we have love and understanding.  Yes, I have contact with units, but it is productive!  Isn't it ‚ÄúHigh and Light‚Äù? <br><br><h5>  <b>Lectures</b> </h5><br>  No need, please, about ‚ÄúBut if the teacher is interested in a lecture, then I am!  Yes I am! ‚Äù, Have no illusions.  Be it an interesting lecture from a favorite teacher.  I want to.  Sleep.  I am a young student.  I had a stormy evening and no less stormy night.  A more turbulent lecturer just physically can not be.  Leave them alone and do not need to be punished in exams for absenteeism.  If you are an interesting and adequate teacher, you will have regular students.  Yes, a few people, but you and they will receive satisfaction.  And those who stayed to sleep at home. <br><br><h5>  <b>Bribes</b> </h5><br>  We are not talking about those who take bribes, right?  Anyone who does not take it, there are different stories about various ‚Äúbases‚Äù, but it also depends on the university.  I, fortunately, had no such problem.  But there was plenty of reason to mock when the money was offered to me after all.  We would continue to laugh and pin up with the head of the department, but the student quickly faded into the sunset. <br><br><h5>  <b>Planck quality, consequences and problems.</b>  <b>Vent</b> </h5><br><blockquote>  There is such a psychological phenomenon as a quality bar.  This is a certain level of quality, each with his own, working below which you get a growing dissatisfaction, which subsequently leads to serious psychological problems, such as burnout, apathy, loss of interest in work and profession, inability to develop. </blockquote><br>  These are actual problems for all trades.  You can not agree with your "quality bar" as a teacher, do not agree in other professional activities! <blockquote>  The consequences can be the most difficult, if you do not heed the advice of the experienced and your mind and heart.  This is a deep dissatisfaction, financial problems, family troubles and disorder, pain for ineptly lived years, loss of qualifications, reduced self-esteem, serious problems with nerves and mentality, and with health in general.  All this for what? </blockquote>  This bouquet can wait in the career of anyone.  And alcohol, by the way, too. <br>  The percentage of grumbling and grumbling old hangers among teachers is very low.  Working with young people, you yourself remain young.  My 70-year-old student doesn't even look like a 70-year-old.  Clear mind, activity, dedication and fashionable costume.  You must constantly keep the tone working with young people.  But I see this as a huge plus and engine for self-improvement, and not a reason to lean. <br><br><h5>  <b>Total</b> </h5><br>  This is where to find such a job so that: it is easy to work and have a lot of rest;  a priori be all respected;  get high salary;  do not know who the "thieves";  where many colleagues will share with you your * hobbies *;  where career growth is steep and endless.  To this, of course, need to strive, but where?  Where is the place?  Want!!! <br><br>  And now briefly the advantages of teaching: <br><ul><li>  Intellectual profession.  All those around you are somehow involved in science and passionate about their work.  You will be aware of the latest scientific developments in your field; </li></ul><br><ul><li>  Creative profession.  You yourself regulate the workflow and create classes; </li></ul><br><ul><li>  Realization of ambitions.  Publications, participation in conferences, communication with smart and enthusiastic; </li></ul><br><ul><li>  Psychological aspect.  You somehow have to develop your qualities as a strong personality, oratorical skills, learn to work with people; </li></ul><br><ul><li>  In July and August there are no students!  Two.  Summer.  Of the month  Do what you want.  You can weed beds at a dacha, you can write a training manual; </li></ul><br><ul><li>  Elixir of youth.  You should always be interesting, fashionable and be aware of what young people live.  How can you become moldy? </li></ul><br><ul><li>  Potential job opportunities.  Proceeding from the fact that you yourself form the most part of your working time and surround you: those who need tutors;  grant information;  many enterprises cooperate with universities; </li></ul><br><ul><li>  <s>Wives are aging, and students of the 3rd course never</s> </li></ul></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/297426/">https://habr.com/ru/post/297426/</a></p>
