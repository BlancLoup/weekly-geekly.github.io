  <section class="page js-page"><h1>VPN Client Overview for Android 4.x</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><h4>  Relevance of the topic </h4><br>  It‚Äôs no secret that recent trends in Internet regulation scare lovers of freedom and anonymity (for example, <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/152735/">blocking YouTube in Dagestan</a> ).  Even on Habr√©, topics with information on how to set up a <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/153855/">VPN server for personal needs</a> appear with enviable consistency.  Add here the fact that there are a large number of resources that are not available from certain territories, but which are of particular interest to users, such as the Internet cinema <a href="http://www.hulu.com/">Hulu.com</a> , the Internet radio <a href="http://www.spotify.com/">Spotify</a> and <a href="http://www.pandora.com/">Pandora</a> .  And even the <a href="http://www.ivi.ru/">ivi.ru</a> Internet cinema does not allow non-Russian users to access their content. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Do not forget about such a function of VPN as data protection on the "last mile."  This is especially useful for those who travel frequently and connect to the network from various places.  There can be no assurance that a WiFi access point is safe, but not provided by an attacker for the purpose of intercepting data, because you don‚Äôt need to call a special Beeline-Free-Wifi point, and most users won‚Äôt check whether it is Beeline or not. <br>  In general, if you still think that you do not need a VPN, then you can not read further. <br><br><h4>  VPN and Android, difficult childhood </h4><br>  Despite the fact that Android is based on Linux, the situation with VPN in early versions of android is deplorable.  All because of Google's startless sluggishness in terms of correcting some errors.  There are actually two problems with VPN on older versions of Android: <br>  1. Encryption in PPtP does not work.  Totally.  The connection is established, it works for some time, then it dies safely, and no data is sent.  This bug is well-known, and even there is a big topic in Google's tracker for <a href="http://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail%3Fid%3D4706">broken PPtP</a> .  There are reports that in versions 2.3.7 this was corrected, but alas, I did not test it, since it was updated. <br>  2. Feature of work of L2TP / IPsec.  The fact is that the installation of the connection key goes through key-storage.  And when placing a key in the storage, the application that added the key is taken into account.  BUT, at the connection itself, the key request comes from the system user, and since the key was stored on behalf of the VPN client, any launch of the VPN from L2TP / IPsec fails.  There is no key. <br><br>  But not everything is so sad.  In the new version of Android, Google announced a new API - VpnService.  It allows you to implement your own VPN protocols and exchange traffic with the system through special interfaces (essentially TUN).  And everything seems to be great, but even there it was not without a barrel of tar in a spoonful of honey, namely - the TUN-driver is missing on an entire army of devices: <br>  - Amazon Kindle tablets; <br>  - many devices from Sony; <br>  - Most Chinese tablets.

      In general, if your device belongs to one of the listed classes of devices, most likely the VPN will not work for you. <br><br>  A small lyrical digression: if your Android device is rutovan, then you can put the TUN driver on Android 2.x and 4.x, but in this review I intentionally miss this kind of software, and if you are interested, I will consider it in the next review. <br><br><h4>  About the choice of software </h4><br>  The choice of software was made in an extremely simple way - search on Google Play with Asus Transformer on request VPN.  Review participants: <br>  - Hotspot Shield VPN; <br>  - Vpn One Click; <br>  - Hideman VPN; <br>  - PandaPow VPN; <br><br>  But first things first. <br><br><h5>  Hotspot shield vpn </h5><br>  Website: <a href="http://www.anchorfree.com/">www.anchorfree.com</a> <br>  Google Play: <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details%3Fid%3Dhotspotshield.android.vpn">play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=hotspotshield.android.vpn</a> <br><img src="https://lh3.ggpht.com/wZjdGR3oGKurKJtxLSXnbERhz54b3xZplm3Dv6UTBbxQ4Oxu_RQmlAo642dTAI6W3Q"><br>  I will not be mistaken if I call HSS the fathers of free VPN.  I think few people who did not use their service.  But immediately to the point: <br>  <b>pros</b> <br>  - do not need to register.  At all.  Launched and it works.  Serious software approach. <br>  - there is a widget for quick connection.  Alas, its design is strongly embossed in appearance.  But he is and it is good. <br>  - absolute free.  The only thing that in theory will show ads.  But I never saw her anywhere.  Perhaps not yet implemented. <br>  - good speed (I was given 4 megabits with VPN enabled) <br>  <b>Minuses</b> <br>  - eerie design.  It does not fit into the style of Android. <br>  - in spite of the fact that servers are in the USA, sometimes other countries may be required (for example, UK for BBC iPlayer).  But alas, there is no choice of countries. <br>  - A terrible, disgusting die that hangs in the tray and cannot be removed.  Totally.  It spoils the tray with one of its appearance.  Apparently because of this dash HSS is the only program that has the Un-install button right on the main screen. <br>  <b>Prices</b> <br>  For the version without ads (which is no longer there anyway), they ask for $ 1.99 per month or $ 19.99 per year. <br>  <b>Conclusion</b> <br>  Add a choice of countries and remove this terrible plate in the tray.  And so the solution for every day for most users. <br><br><h5>  Vpn one click </h5><br>  Website: <a href="http://www.vpnoneclick.com/">www.vpnoneclick.com</a> <br>  Google Play: <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details%3Fid%3Dcom.vpnoneclick.android">play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.vpnoneclick.android</a> <br><img src="https://lh5.ggpht.com/lISighaji1xaphlGSFFA7lUu1YALg3Dx8mwny_nPQi87xxqzBRPSkJlyVu61peVi5Uw"><br>  An exceptionally simple program that immediately displays a list of available countries for connection on the main screen.  The only problem is that in free mode you can only connect to a random server, and you cannot strictly indicate which country you need.  When you start immediately adds a subscription for a year. <br>  <b>pros</b> <br>  - easy to use, free for a year (and a year later the device can be replaced); <br>  - there are different countries, what was missing in the HSS; <br>  <b>Minuses</b> <br>  - there is no normal indication in the program that the connection was successful; <br>  - in free mode, you can not select a specific country. <br><br>  <b>Prices</b> <br>  Very affordable prices: $ 2.99 for 3 months and $ 8.99 per year.  You can pay for Liberty Reserve (fans of anonymity rejoice) and Paypal. <br>  <b>Conclusion</b> <br>  In free mode as HSS, the only difference is that the country may not be the United States.  A slightly non-obvious interface, but overall a decent alternative to HSS. <br><br><h5>  Hideman VPN </h5><br>  Website: <a href="http://www.hideman.net/">www.hideman.net</a> <br>  Google Play: <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details%3Fid%3Dnet.hideman">play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.hideman</a> <br><img src="https://lh3.ggpht.com/3UDdGd31yJH7Kw4OPCTHmUzFgDyu4GbC4Dvffr2pqDZfPfIbnUsNhNl2M-krrB49y_K7"><br>  The program is made in the style of Android.  The big green button does not get into that is impossible.  Registration is not required.  Give 5 hours a week.  The rest, alas, for the money. <br>  <b>pros</b> <br>  - cute, comfortable; <br>  - there is a choice of countries; <br>  - there is a widget to connect.  Prettier than the HSS. <br>  <b>Minuses</b> <br>  - only 5 hours free.  For those who will constantly use VPN using without a paid subscription is impossible. <br>  <b>Prices</b> <br>  From $ 2.9 per month to $ 24.9 per year, which is more expensive than HSS and VPN One Click. <br>  <b>Conclusion</b> <br>  A good option for occasional use.  Alas, it is impossible to use it constantly without purchase. <br><br><h5>  PandaPow </h5><br>  Website: <a href="https://pandapow.co/">pandapow.co</a> <br>  Google Play: <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details%3Fid%3Dcom.pandapow.vpn">play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.pandapow.vpn</a> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/fdb/2c5/373/fdb2c537305ac55f26506456ffa7cac9.jpg"><br>  In truth, this software in general should not be in the review.  I first chose a set of software, and when I put PandaPow I realized that this program essentially just copies the connection password to the clipboard, and you need to configure access manually, in one word useless. <br><br>  <b>Results</b> <br>  In general, my hopes for a large number of high-quality VPN software for non-ruled Android devices scattered to pieces.  Nevertheless, if you choose from the software presented in the review, I left three programs on my device.  Each performs its role: <br>  - HSS - long surfing in unprotected networks, access to USA-only resources; <br>  - Vpn One Click and Hideman VPN for cases when you need not US addresses, and you need to get the IP of any other country. <br><br>  PS There is a desire to review VPN clients for other platforms, as the experience of using these clients is very large.  If the topic is interesting to the audience of Habra, then I am ready to do new reviews. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/154497/">https://habr.com/ru/post/154497/</a></p>
