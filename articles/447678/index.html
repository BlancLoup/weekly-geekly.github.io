  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The concept of a brief encyclopedia</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Brief encyclopedia based on the principles of conciseness, clarity and detail. <br><br><h2>  Information is divided into different sources, duplicated and redundant. </h2><br>  Humanity suffers from an oversupply of information.  However, the problem lies not only in the amount of information, but also in its quality.  The Internet is replete with various sources, each of which duplicates some of the information from other sources.  Reading a new article we have to weed out what is already known.  The information itself is often presented in an extremely diluted form, full of extensive thoughts of the author and other redundancy.  For some reason, it is believed that the longer the article or the thicker the book, the more substantial they are.  The concentration of information is not always taken into account. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  The goal is to present information in the most accessible way. </h2><br>  Submission of information should be convenient to the reader, they are easy to perceive.  The goal is to achieve the highest possible learning speed.  To achieve this goal information must be in the process of continuous processing.  When writing a new article, the information remains unchanged after the publication of the article.  Instead, it is proposed to constantly improve the quality of the information already available and integrate new information with the old one.  Constant refactoring is needed to improve the flow of information. <br><br><h2>  Information should be brief and as concentrated as possible. </h2><br>  Information concentration should be constantly increased.  However, its presentation should not go against the simplicity and clarity.  Any concept can be presented in the form understandable for the reader who is not familiar with the topic.  The goal is to set out without losing the meaning in fewer words.  The smaller the portion of the data, the faster it will be learned.  A piece of data should be devoted to one concept.  Each serving is a complete thought.  Portion should be a very concise and clear text.

    <h2>  Information is hierarchical and systematized. </h2><br>  Under the hierarchy refers to the presentation of the general to the particular.  The general summarizes, sums up many particulars.  The general is the title from which the content is understandable.  The presentation of information in a general way allows a person already familiar with the information to skip it, and not a friend to get a general idea.  When you go to the topic of the title information is overgrown with details.  Opens more detailed content, which in turn can be further disclosed.  Systematization means the distribution of the types and themes for ease of navigation. <br><br><h2>  Portions are made up of articles and books </h2><br>  At the initial stage, it is planned to remove excess water from books and articles, leaving concentrated contents.  The goal is to reduce the amount of text without losing meaning.  Then present this information as simply and conveniently for the end user.  This can not be considered plagiarism, because the resulting marc is the result of creative processing.  It is planned not just to copy pieces of text, but to briefly present your understanding.  Share information into general and specific concepts.  Later, when enough information is gathered, the portions will merge with each other to eliminate duplication. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/447678/">https://habr.com/ru/post/447678/</a></p>
