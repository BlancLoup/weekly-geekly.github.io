      Description of one of the possible options for the future in which we could live under a cat. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2><anchor>  A warning </anchor></h2><br>  The described theory is based on the current level of technological development.  So, people who do not believe in this philosophy may not understand that technology gives mankind a special opportunity - the ability to use together information that is located in kilometers and hours from you.  To implement this theory in practice, it is assumed the presence of some technologies (for example, Internet access).  But if some technologies are unavailable or unattainable today, they will appear within a decade.  In addition, the document describes the final goals.  The way to achieve them is a complex task and relates to another document.  Some of the ideas listed are taken and / or based on ideas from the books of ‚Äú <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daemon_(technothriller_series)">Daemon</a> ‚Äù and ‚Äú <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daemon_(technothriller_series)">Freedom ‚Ñ¢</a> ‚Äù by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Suarez">Daniel Suarez</a> .  Note: not all details are fully disclosed (for example, additional reality glasses), because they allow unlimited scope for innovation.  This political philosophy does not leave laws in the past, but rather provides them with a new environment for the future.  In addition, it is necessary to take into account that other ideas of implementation were deliberately omitted in order to recreate the full-fledged dictatorship of the Techno-Anarchist society with its inherent limitations. <br><br>  It must be remembered that anarchism, in fact, excludes the presence of hierarchies.  Techno-Anarchism is a mixture of Anarcho-Capitalism with Anarcho-Socialism;  hierarchies are not excluded in business, in families, etc., but governing bodies are perhaps excluded.  It can be assumed that the program for interaction between people is the governing body.  If you decide to look at everything from such an angle, then understand that the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãsuperiority is foreign to Anarchy.  The technology underlying this society, strictly speaking, is a medium of communication that eliminates human incompetence at some levels and in some cases human error.  I will argue that the technology foundation itself does not control, as the government does.  Rather, it is the computing center of society.  This is the thing that will perform complex calculations to provide the end user with extensive experience, without interfering with the actions that he or she is currently performing. <br><br><h2><anchor>  Overview </anchor></h2><br>  What is Techno Anarchism?  Techno-Anarchism is a theory based on giving people the opportunity to lead each other, using technology as an intermediary.  The system uses the governing bodies as temporary structures that are built, and then understood.  In general, Techno-Anarchism can be described as the right of a people to make their own decisions and, if necessary, to protect their choices. <br><br><h2><anchor>  Introduction </anchor></h2><br>  Everyone remembers a time when someone approached us with a weapon and said: "I would shoot you, but it is illegal, so I will not do that."  The law, which states that you should not kill, is not necessary, because most people are not going to kill anyone.  Murder is the result of our actions.  People who had to kill, either regretted their deed, or - no.  The previous is true for most killers, with the exception of those who killed unnecessarily. <br><br>  How will we bring to justice those who do not regret the murder?  In our current system there is a presumption of innocence.  Innocence until proven guilty in court, and only in that which is recognized by society.  The main consequence, besides the verdict itself, is a conviction that haunts the person.  I say a person, because the great criminals created other people when it was necessary, and had the opportunity to get rid of past convictions.  If a single mother with a child meets someone, how can she know that a person has been convicted if he has changed his identity?  This question can be answered through modern technology.  A simple biometric scanner can link a person and a person.  We use fingerprints, because we assume that there are no identical prints, but this theory is like the religious reasoning of many people: we cannot disprove something, which means it is.  The technologies that we have give us the opportunity to revise the existing views on the old system.  If we continue to use fingerprints and suddenly find out that some prints are duplicated, it turns out that a simple shift in identity gives room to criminals.  Or we will understand that through the Internet you can establish a huge connection of information in a safe and pseudo-anonymous manner to create a real-life network between people based on technology that does not require government authority.  Then we will not adapt to the technogenic era and will be doomed to our own death. <br><br><h6>  <sup>1</sup> Pseudo-anonymity does not refer to the fact that individuals will be pseudo-anonymous, but rather to the fact that the current person is anonymous.  In the sense that all information is publicly available, but not directly related to the person. </h6><br><br><h2><anchor>  Scalable invariant holons </anchor></h2><br>  At the moment, our system is designed on the principle that allows you to completely depend on others.  Imported oil, imported cars and the US dollar are excellent examples of how the United States has built into the global society, but have become dependent on it.  Although the USA has its own deposits, for various reasons they insist on using imported oil <sup>2</sup> .  They can open up access to energy reserves, but this will not mean anything, because oil pumped from the coast of Florida must be distributed among all residents of the United States.  Until we unite, the benefits will be small.  But we will not unite as long as the good does not look promising.  So there can be no question of unity.  This argument shows the lack of the concept of a nation: if one aspect of a nation collapses, then it affects all dependent aspects <sup>3</sup> ;  This concept is characteristic of all goods and services.  The American dollar is the currency that stands behind everything, but what if it collapses?  Since  The United States is interconnected with other countries, now it will lead to a global problem, whereas this, in fact, should be a local problem <sup>4</sup> . <br><br>  How do we solve this problem?  Scalable invariant holons - the answer to the question of dependencies, the problem of confidence and the solution of questions of stability.  Scalable invariant holons are territories that scale the needs of a country to the needs of the local population.  This concept allows holons to be independent, completely stable and relying only on themselves.  If the United States were divided into scalable invariant holons, they would not feel the need for imported oil, because each holon would extract oil or use natural energy sources.  Each holon will be engaged in production for making money and for ensuring their own needs.  The task is to make a small society that would be completely autonomous and could function independently.  What is the optimal holon size?  As low as possible, to the extent possible, given the 100% stability, but without restrictions on the movement of people inside the holon <sup>5</sup> .  For example, the holon creates a new automobile brand "X".  This holon is the main producer of orange juice in the states.  Perhaps the brand "X" will release a car that rides on orange juice?  Let the example be contrived, but the very concept of creation from what is available and studied is that reliable and understandable idea, which is the cornerstone of sustainability.  Although every holon is completely independent, this does not mean that it should be isolated.  Holons can join forces in tasks, events or even in production, but self-sustainability provides a guarantee of the usefulness of the holon.  An important question arises: how does this relate to technology?  The answer to this question will be given after researching the required technologies and how they will be used. <br><br>
<h6>  <sup>2</sup> One should be aware that this is not due to the concerns of environmentalists, who say that drilling oil wells will harm the environment, but rather because of an installation based on unwillingness to have self-sustaining energy. <br>  <sup>3</sup> For example, a rise in gas prices leads to a rise in food prices, which leads to a decrease in income.  Reduced incomes lead to recession, which leads to depression, which leads to the general collapse of the country. <br>  <sup>4</sup> Currency problems will be discussed in the appropriate section. <br>  <sup>5</sup> At some point, the holon is obliged to stop expanding in order not to become too large and not to burst.  The task is to have such holons, which, in case of collapse, will not lead to the collapse of other holons. </h6><br><br><h2><anchor>  Reputation </anchor></h2><br>  In modern society, reputation is more important than wealth.  People tend to be famous.  It does not matter - on a global scale, on a national scale, whether local or family.  Free software and open source mechanisms are based on reputation.  People who contribute to such open-source products like Mozilla Firefox and Chromium OS allow the software to flourish and at the same time build a solid reputation for themselves.  In the future, the reputation can be transferred to the currency.  The question is, how do we use all the power of reputation? <br><br>  What if a scalable invariant holon and an individual along with a business have a visual reputation?  I directly refer to the reputation that, with the right hardware and software, can be seen.  For example, Joe Smith looks for a new place of residence and looks at the Seattle Holon.  Examines the visual complement of the Welcome to Seattle Holon sign, which displays information about the holon, including its reputation.  The reputational breakdown says that there is a 70% level of sustainability, a 90% happiness rating, a population of 1 million and 5% crime rates.  Joe thinks this is a great place to live, so he decides to talk to the people who live in the holon at the moment.  He finds Maggie Lune and Rex Michaelson and speaks with them.  He sees that Maggie‚Äôs reputation level is 93 out of 100, which means: 93% of all people who rated her interaction with them gave her a very high rating.  Rex, on the other hand, has a reputation of 23 out of 100. You can make an informed decision about listening to people's advice based on their level of reputation or on listening to / reading reviews written about this person <sup>6</sup> .  After reading / listening to a couple of reviews, Joe decides to trust and value Maggie‚Äôs opinion more than Rex‚Äôs. <br><br>  Someone wonders: how will this system protect a good person from receiving fake or distorted reviews?  Based on the law of large numbers, we can assume that the number of people entering the rating system is much larger than the number of incoming questions (the spectrum of people will become smoother, so the anomalies will look like anomalies, as opposed to accurate data).  Also in this system there will be rare cases when a person takes money for work that people don‚Äôt like (ie, makes <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A1%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BB%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B0_%25D0%25A0%25D0%2595%25D0%259F%25D0%259E">a repo transaction</a> ) and receives feedback based on these relationships.  So reviews come into play as soon as it becomes possible to check and understand the ratings of those who interacted with the person.  To operate a reputable system, we must have a special set of hardware and software. <br><br><h6>  <sup>6</sup> Left rating can write a review. </h6><br><br><h2><anchor>  Hardware and software </anchor></h2><br>  The new technotronic society will use the latest technotronic tools and gadgets.  The coolest and most useful gadget will be <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2598%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B0%25D1%2582%25D0%25BE%25D1%2580_%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B0_%25D0%25BB%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B1%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BC_%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BA%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B5">HUD-</a> glasses, equipped with an <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2594%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BF%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BB%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B0%25D1%258F_%25D1%2580%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BB%25D1%258C%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BE%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D1%258C">augmented reality</a> system.  Theoretically, they will be connected to the 4g network and can be charged by solar energy <sup>7</sup> .  A simple augmented reality system will connect to a decentralized network of people connected with their glasses.  This <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2594%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BF%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BB%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B0%25D1%258F_%25D1%2580%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BB%25D1%258C%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BE%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D1%258C">Darknet</a> will ensure confidentiality and stability through the implementation of a decentralized network model, including a closed version of <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tor">TOR</a> <sup>8</sup> , which will create anonymity through <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reasonable_doubt">reasonable doubts</a> (nothing can be traced to the starting node), and there will be random data mirroring <sup>9</sup> as a guarantee of network integrity.  With regard to these technologies, the most difficult and cool (for me) is artificial intelligence <sup>10</sup> , built into HUD glasses.  The AI ‚Äã‚Äãwill be a tool used for the <i>Authentication</i> <sup>11</sup> system, ensuring and using Darknet mirroring, and for augmented reality.  In addition to the simple augmented reality, there will be some kind of integrated personal information analysis engine built into HUD-glasses and Darknet.  "Analysis of personal information" is a way to connect Internet accounts with email, email with providers, providers with billing addresses, billing addresses with finances, finances with people.  The process of authenticating the identity will be described in more detail below. <br><br>  A valid identity check will reference the pseudo-you.  The verifier will attach accounts and information to the identifier.  Thus, if Stan Murf did not want you to know that his YouTube account is *** <i>masonreptiloid</i> ***, then this account will not refer to Stan Murf.  But most likely his ID will be like <i>n0onekN0sm3</i> .  The constant problem is that you may accidentally reveal the information being verified, and it will be connected to you.  So if employer Stan Murf knows his name, then he immediately finds out that his identifier is <i>n0onekN0sm3</i> and now owns all the information about him.  We can solve this problem if we do not disclose the results of the test to anyone.  In fact, this information will not be anyone.  It is checked in real time and stores only one boolean value, reflecting the verification status.  With regards to HUD points, you can see an identifier and a blue daw next to the name, indicating that you have an identified person who does not hide personal information.  In this scenario, anonymity and authentic identification exist in a pair. <br><br>  Note that the limits of HUD points are limited only by our imagination.  The ideas above are based only on verification and do not affect anything more, because I do not want to limit the behavior of the HUD.  Another example of how HUD glasses can be used in the context of car access to glasses by bluetooth: checking the owner‚Äôs ability to drive and cognitive functions for driving.  So HUD-glasses can be used in almost any situation. <br><br><h6>  <sup>7</sup> At the current time, we do not know if there is any health risk associated with these technologies.  So in the first versions a small external computer will be attached to the device, which is responsible for the 4g connection, as well as processing all that needs to be processed.  Thus, not all needs are solved directly with the help of glasses. <br>  <sup>8</sup> The reason why it is necessary to use a closed version of TOR is that the weakest node in the TOR network determines the speed of all the other nodes, so that the closed version will be run only on glasses.  Thus, it will be updated as the software is updated, and the network will operate at a consistently good speed. <br>  <sup>9 The</sup> pseudo-random aspects of the network will be displayed in the HUD-glasses and, when the glasses are connected to the network, they scan information somewhere on the Darknet (usually the information has some identification code, so the AI ‚Äã‚Äãalgorithm embedded in the HUD-glasses can successfully determine information in reasonable time). <br>  <sup>10</sup> By this AI, I mean that it does not have self-awareness, but at the same time it uses <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259C%25D0%25B0%25D1%2588%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B5_%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B1%25D1%2583%25D1%2587%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B5">machine learning</a> (recognition of Darknet patterns of mirrors for easier verification), robotics (integration into the Authentication system), natural language processing (for augmented reality and authentication using <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_conduction">jaw conduction</a> technologies), computer vision and automatic inference (for augmented reality) and knowledge representation (for Authentication, augmented reality and Darknet mirroring). <br>  <sup>11</sup> <i>Authentication</i> is an authentication system that combines biometric features in the same way that a living person uses them.  In HUD glasses, this will represent an iris scan, a fingerprint scan (the side of the glasses), a pulse check at the fingertip (on the prints part and behind the fingernail to make sure the pulses match) for authentication.  It's not easy - to fake all these things at once ... Especially when the AI ‚Äã‚Äãengine will use small cameras to track all aspects of the scan to avoid cheating. </h6><br><br><h2><anchor>  Society </anchor></h2><br>  Society is free from hierarchies in the traditional governmental sense, because it lacks permanent external leadership (see the section on <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/197418/">Government</a> ).  Society is based on a reputation system.  As an example, take the protection of the environment.  A business may be interested in protecting the environment for two reasons: either they want to do it, or they must.  Holon will encourage environmental protection, because it increases the efficiency of resource use, which in turn leads to a higher stability factor.  In fact, each holon makes its own decision about its own needs. <br><br>  The described society is designed as an archetype of freedom.  Society does not include anything other than holons.  Borrowing some mathematical terms, society is something that contains a multitude of holons (i.e. <img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage3/121/53b/899/12153b899e2983adcf2096fdee208d0a.png">  ).  But this by no means excludes other hierarchies (such as business or academic institutions, although they can use techno-anarchism as a model). <br><br><h2><anchor>  Money </anchor></h2><br>  For the described system, it is recommended to use <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin">bitcoins</a> as a currency, because it is an open monetary system free from existing inflation problems.  If the recommendation is accepted, then the following should be done: <br><ul><li>  Paper money is canceled (no paper bitcoins!), Because bitcoins (BTC) cannot be printed in the physical world.  By printing them on paper, you are undermining the true value of Bitcoin.  Physically, electronic money should be available as long as the medium holds the bitcoins in itself (so this is not a commitment, but rather a physical interpretation of the digital media). </li><li>  Using bitcoins anonymously and allows HUD-glasses to act as a wallet in addition to its main functions. </li></ul><br><br><h2><anchor>  Emergency services </anchor></h2><br>  Our concept is based on pure rationalism: why do I have to pay if you allowed your house to ignite?  And why will you have to when the fire happens to me? <br><br>  Tax-based emergency services will be eliminated and replaced with a system more like insurance.  If you paid for the annual police insurance, then after you needed the police, you make an appropriate surcharge, which will be either a small amount, or even 0 BTC.  If you do not have insurance, you pay the full cost out of your pocket.  Also, the situation with fires and health.  If, as can be seen in restaurants, someone is not able to pay the bill, he fulfills his debt.  The discussion on this item is incomplete, as is the consideration of crimes, penalties and the judicial system, and will be completed in one of the following sections. <br><br><h2><anchor>  Social obligations </anchor></h2><br>  In the described society there are no direct social obligations.  There is no commitment to the holon either.  The equivalent of a jury jury is voluntary and can even be funny.  There is no conscription system, so there is no obligation to protect the public (see the <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/197418/">Defense</a> section for more information).  When a particular need for help from society arises, there are two ways: a person can either ask you for help as a charity, or offer a payment for your time and energy.  This provides opportunities for people who want to help others, and through cash encourages others to help. <br><br><h2><anchor>  Personal freedom </anchor></h2><br>  You are you.  I am me.  You do not control me, and I - you.  As soon as you begin to try to control my life or try to influence the freedom of my personality, we seem to have some problems.  We may be in a civil marriage and lead our lives in parallel, but when one of us feels that his rights are violated, problems arise.  Freedom of personality is part of everything.  The only reason this article contains a chapter on civil liberties is to prevent potential trouble.  If you endanger the rights of another person (including the right to life), he may turn to the justice system to counteract you <sup>12</sup> . <br><br><h6>  <sup>12</sup> For example, I am driving on a highway at a speed of 110 km / h, and you ‚Äúfly‚Äù to 300 km / h.  You hurt me a little, because even though your car can drive so fast, you can't handle it.  I can go to justice and classify your actions as a threat to life (see details in the section <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/197418/">Crime, Punishment and the Judicial System</a> ). </h6><br><br><h2><anchor>  Civil liberties </anchor></h2><br>  This chapter is present only for technical reasons.  Civil liberties are an extension of individual liberty that extends to more than one person.  Groups of people have rights that ensure their freedom.  Some specific examples are: <br><ul><li>  Marriage: There are no laws or regulators for any type of marriage, because marrying anyone does not affect the marriage of anyone else. </li><li>  Abortions: not my problem (like killing, like your next birthday ... only if I am not invited ... to my birthday, not to kill). </li></ul><br><br><h2><anchor>  Government </anchor></h2><br>  The system of government that we need will be temporary.  It should be formed and convened only when necessary.  When referring to the judicial system, the message is sent to third parties that Darknet deems appropriate (i.e., to verified third parties), and they are invited to spend time on charity - to participate in the council for the settlement of discussions / disputes / debates.  The board will include an even number of members (to stop <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259E%25D0%25B1%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D1%2580%25D1%2583%25D0%25BA%25D1%2586%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B7%25D0%25BC">obstructionism</a> ).  Board members receive questionnaires and must make a unanimous decision.  So innovative solutions are preferred.  These are the functions of a search advice / creation of innovative solutions for all parties.  If the council does not come to a decision or an innovative proposal, a new council is requested.  Anyone who does not want to help is not obliged to do this.  If there are no applicants at all, the claimant or the respondent may offer a fee as an incentive to attract participants to the council.  The plaintiff and / or the defendant must indicate how much they can offer.  The system distributes this information to the same people who have already been invited to participate in the council, but with a note that they can receive <img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage3/869/454/899/86945489984f594612b1ad5fbe216a24.png">  from the total number of proposed bitcoins. <br><br><h2><anchor>  Crime, Punishment and Judicial System </anchor></h2><br>  Techno-Anarchism needs a new judicial system.  Anything could be a crime.  If someone wants to go to justice, all he needs to do is call the court system using his HUD-glasses and the identifier of another person.  The call to the judiciary initializes the search and convening infrastructure.  If successful, the claimant and the defendant should choose the desired punishment.  The claimant may indicate any punishment he wants, but if it is too severe and, if the defendant is found guilty, the defendant is immediately released.  If the defendant is found not guilty, then his desired sentence is carried out in the event that the council finds this to be justified.  This state of affairs gives true meaning to justice within society. <br><br>  If an ordinary crime occurs, you can call the police, but you have to pay for it through insurance or from your pocket. <br><br>  People can still be arrested.  Laws regarding arrests may vary from holon to holon.  An extradition process can be implemented between different holons.  So a person accused of one holon but residing in another can be extradited to the one where he was accused.  In many cases, to establish the truth under the force of law, the AI ‚Äã‚Äãcan be requested in HUD-glasses (sometimes simply in the form of a question: did you kill Mohammed Lee?). <br>  In the event that, without good reason, the sentence was brought into execution much later than the crime took place, the council takes into consideration the state of the defendant and the sentence handed down. <br><br>  In prison, inmates work to pay daily expenses related to the services of society and the labor of free people in the holon in which they are detained.  Note: just because a person is in prison, he is not deprived of access to the judicial system (so if someone is raped while working out debts, he or she still has the right to appeal to the judicial system). <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_jeopardy">Double punishment</a> still exists, but in an alternative form.  In the case of a retrial in connection with a new evidence, the same council is convened.  In the case of a repeated hearing in connection with the respondent‚Äôs dissatisfaction, the punishment is set to double the amount and the respondent cannot re-apply to the court without new evidence. <br><br><h2><anchor>  Defense </anchor></h2><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Defense is an interesting topic, because it is located in two realities at once: physical and digital. In fact, most conflicts can be resolved with an innovative computer virus. The only types of threats that cannot be resolved on the digital plane are conflicts that you face-to-face (i.e. gun, knife, rape, robbery) and the police can help with these problems (at a reasonable cost of police insurance) . Removing the restrictions on short-barreled weapons </font></font><sup><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">13</font></font></sup><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> can perfectly help with this problem. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">There used to be times when the physical army was a necessity, but with the arrival of </font></font><a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25AD%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BA%25D1%2582%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B3%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D1%2582%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B0%25D1%258F_%25D0%25B1%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B1%25D0%25B0"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">electromagnetic bombs</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">we can withstand a nuclear strike before it is dealt. EMR is like a modern nuclear weapon, they should only be used as an extreme measure, because they can destroy everything. In fact, a well-targeted computer virus should be equally successful. If someone is able to infect a hijacked plane with a virus, then it can be shot down or taken under control. A well-targeted computer virus can be just as effective, and maybe even more effective, than all of our troops, because it can multiply itself, does not make mistakes, and does not harm people.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">If society needs a physical army, then money can stimulate volunteers. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">However, they can leave at any time without consequences. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">This gives the opportunity to fight mainly special forces. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In addition, we will use weapons with AI, which is destroyed after the battle. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Weapons with AI must be able to remotely press the self-destruct button, as well as the immediate destruction function, in case it is not restarted. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">This self-destruct function will also be a bomb function, but there is always the possibility that the enemy will disable this function. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">So it is imperative that no one could steal a weapon, otherwise there is a risk of being blown up by enemy forces.</font></font><br><br><h6> <sup><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">13</font></font></sup><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> Weapon restrictions will be removed by society in order to give businesses the freedom to create (if necessary) their restrictions on their private property.</font></font></h6><br><br><h2><anchor>  Education </anchor></h2><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Making children love learning is the responsibility of their parents. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In the end, parents have complete control over their children's education. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">We recommend two possible scenarios of education from many possible:</font></font><br><ul><li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Parents develop their own curriculum based on ready-made templates. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The adjustments made depend on the success of the child. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">This is all done to give the child a complete, practical and well-designed quest on the school path.</font></font></li><li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> The child goes to the mass school center. </font></font></li></ul><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In the first version, parents can give the child a task like the following: see a lecture at Harvard Business School and apply it to hypothetical variables XYZ, taking into account the factors ABC. With the arrival of </font></font><a href="http://www.apple.com/ru/apps/itunes-u/"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">iTunes U</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> , </font></font><a href="http://www.youtube.com/"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">YouTube</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> and </font></font><a href="http://bigthink.com/"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Big Think</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> , knowledge is at the fingertips of people. In addition, young students can organize trips to museums, take virtual tours of monuments online and practice activities that allow them to explore knowledge and instill a love of learning. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The second option allows the school center to be configured with the ability to create your own curriculum with individual training (for example, </font></font><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sylvan_Learning"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Sylvan Learning Centers</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> ) or use more widely specialized and proven programs.</font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> Remember that the task is to instill in children a love of learning, and for this, any means are good. </font></font><br><br><h2><anchor>  Private property </anchor></h2><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> Pragmatically, the system of private property that we have now fits into a new society, so that it can be transferred to individual holons or redone by holons at their will. </font></font><br><br><h2><anchor>  Results </anchor></h2><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Techno-Anarchism is a society designed to restore its power to the people. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">A society that uses technology to improve the world and our lives. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I hope such a social system will instill in everyone the desire to grow as a person, make the members of </font></font><i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">our</font></font></i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> society better and increase the flow of happiness. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I believe that the framework described gives people enough freedom so that they can live their own lives without the need to take care of society as such, because society adapts to what we create.</font></font><br><br><hr><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The original text of the article is </font></font><a href="http://www.scribd.com/doc/78944315/Techno-Anarchism"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">here</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> .</font></font></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/197418/">https://habr.com/ru/post/197418/</a></p>
