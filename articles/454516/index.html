Good content is expensive, sometimes even very, but what to do if the budget is limited and you don‚Äôt want to risk the reputation of the site.  The following guidelines will help you reduce costs while getting good quality content. <br><br><h3>  Why this article? </h3><a name="habracut"></a><br>  In addition to the blog Miralinks, I work as a assessor GetGoodRank - service quality control sites.  Often, articles for posting on the system sites are checked, and we note very low quality.  Texts with errors are useless for readers and unoriginal.  Such a text has no chance of being ranked or bringing users to the site, much less strengthening the brand's reputation.  By and large, such a text and money is generally not worth it.

    <h3>  Why for 200r? </h3><br>  We analyzed the lowest rates on freelance exchanges.  In the cheapest segment, authors are offered from 45 to 65 rubles per 1000 characters of text.  Accordingly, for 200p you can get the text from 3000 to 4000 characters. <br><br><h2>  Training </h2><br>  Work with the text consists of certain stages.  If we reduce costs and do not want to lose in quality, we will have to take on some stages of the work. <br><br>  <b>1. Clearly state the purpose of the text</b> , target audience, idea and plan.  Yes, so much will have to work independently.  But in the end you will receive a text that clearly corresponds to the objectives of the project. <br><br>  <b>2. Find examples of such texts.</b>  You could just order rewriting.  But I do not recommend this.  At one of the online meetings for webmasters, Muller mentioned that the algorithm gives preference to already known content, which has established itself among users.  If you create even a very cool copy, the chances that it will hit the top are extremely small. <br><br>  In addition, ordering rewrite, you limit the author, who can paint your own original ideas. <br><br>  <b>3. Competent technical task</b> - I have been working as a copywriter since 2009.  During this time, reread hundreds of tasks.  And I can say one thing: the clearer the task, the easier it is to work with the text.  Create a single template, which will take into account all the necessary parameters. <br><br>  <b>4. Reasonable time</b> - the less time the author has, the higher the probability of getting a rubbish.  The optimal time for creating a text is 3-5 days.  Even if you provide the author with all the material. <br><br>  <b>5. Make a selection of services</b> that will help the author to check the quality of the text: spell check, text garbage, uniqueness (if this parameter is important).  For my texts, I still use the service of Maxim Ilyakhov.  And although I often leave my option, the check helps to make the text more readable. <br><br>  No need to tell the author what grades the text should receive.  The idea is for the author to check himself and improve the text. <br><br><h2>  Search author </h2><br>  There are not many recommendations here. <br><br>  You can search for: <br><br><ul><li>  on freelance exchanges </li><li>  in groups of social networks </li><li>  on recommendations (word of mouth through colleagues) </li><li>  by contact </li><li>  make a request to past artists whose lyrics are suitable for you. </li></ul><br>  If you publish a vacancy on freelance exchanges, do not restrict access to the task for beginners.  Among them there are also diligent performers.  Even the young author will cope with the proper preparation of the base. <br><br>  <i>A test task</i> is often a waste of time.  Normal text as a test, few people want to write.  And one paragraph to determine how good the author is, is difficult.  Examine the author's portfolio, request links to already posted texts. <br><br>  When choosing authors for projects, I often focus on the response of the performer: I never work with those who copy the template response-blank.  I give preference to authors who, in response to a vacancy, showed interest in the task. <br><br>  You can save on texts in the Miralinks system and simplify your life through the Placement + Writing service.  In this case, the webmaster independently writes the text on the topic in the style and form familiar to the site and the target audience.  This is often cheaper than ordering content from copywriters, and then also agreeing it with the webmaster.  The webmaster may refuse to post if the text does not correspond to the subject, style, level of the site. <br><br><h2>  Layfkhaki, how to improve the quality of text from a copywriter </h2><br><h3>  Offer payment for the article, not for 1000 characters </h3><br>  So you save the text from the water, which often beginners pour, to finish the text to the desired volume.  Let the text be shorter, but the density of information per unit volume will increase. <br><br><h3>  Discard keywords </h3><br>  Although the keys are important, they work well, young authors do not know how to work with them.  Often perceive very literally and use direct entries. <br><br>  To help come advanced machine learning algorithms that extract meaning and understand what, in fact, the text.  In 2019, there is no need to use the entry ‚Äúbuy acrylic baths in Moscow‚Äù. <br><br>  Keys with broken grammar force authors to break the sentence grammar as well.  The text becomes unreadable.  Offer meaningless. <br><br><h3>  Avoid testing for water, nausea and other technical metrics </h3><br>  They do not improve the quality of the text, do not simplify the work of the author with the task, but take time and make you change the natural course of thought to twist the text under the specified parameters. <br><br>  That's all.  I hope these recommendations will help you optimize the order of texts. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/454516/">https://habr.com/ru/post/454516/</a></p>
