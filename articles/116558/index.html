  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Tips for beginning poultry farmers: how to buy Parrot AR.Drone</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  A year or two ago, I read about a curious toy - Parrot AR.Drone.  It is a quadrocopter equipped with a camera and allowing to arrange games with elements of augmented reality.  And so, in early March, I decided to buy this cyberbird.  At Amazon, it cost $ 299.99.  March 5, I made an order. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/4d3/891/a23/4d3891a23f87f9d5b37c45d00b169031.jpg" alt="image"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Since Amazon refused to send a toy to Russia, I used the services of the intermediary office Shipito.com, where I had a California mailbox for more than a year.  I paid for the purchase via PayPal with a Sberbank dollar "visa", indicating the Californian address for delivery.  The very same delivery of the copter in the States was free.  Processing a shipito package cost me $ 8.5. <br><br>  The package went from Amazon only on March 10.  And on March 13, I realized what foolishness I had done!  A couple of years ago, when I did not have a Shipito account, in order to find out how much I would have to pay for the delivery of a product through Shipito, I, as one of the delivery addresses in my Amazon account, entered their address - specifying an arbitrary number mailbox (I didn't have one then).  That is, my "parrot" went to someone unknown!  What a fool I am!  I had FULL DAYS to see and correct the error - and I noticed it several days after it was sent.  Imagination painted pictures, like an unknown Romanian or a Chinese, seeing an $ 300 toy unexpectedly dropped into his box, happily paying for the delivery of an accidental gift.  Or, as the impure Throneer, he writes to me that the parcel I sent to the wrong address has already been sent to the recipient - and he himself represents how his children will be happy with the copter.  And there is no one to blame - only my mistake! <br><br>  Having come to terms with the fact that $ 300 was donated to someone I don‚Äôt know, I wrote a letter in which I described the situation and sent it to all Shipito contacts I had.  And on time!  On March 14, the parcel came to the office of the company - and it was placed in my mailbox :) Well done guys, quickly and honestly responded, correcting my mistake!

      But the adventures did not end there.  In terms of weight and size, the package did not fit either one delivery option - too heavy for one postal service, too heavy for another ... But this problem was solved.  Shipito has a package repackaging service.  On March 15, for an additional $ 8.5, they repacked it in such a way that USPS Express Mail¬Æ Internatiional, $ 86.57, became available.  March 18 parcel went through the ocean. <br><br>  And then I remembered that after our <s>swindlers and thieves had</s> adopted the devil‚Äôs law on criminal prosecution for hidden video filming, even mobile phone batteries were wrapped at customs, and it became possible to get a deadline for work in the field of augmented reality ( installed systems of apartment video surveillance, such terms have already been received).  Nervous hassle started - will my ‚Äúparrot‚Äù go through customs - or will it be wrapped up as spy equipment for covert surveillance.  In one of the video clips advertising the quadrocopter, the ‚Äúpilot‚Äù pushed the rotary-winged machine out of the window, lowered it on a couple of floors - and the drone flew into the window of another apartment.  Fortunately, WiFi and video transmission from the drone's camera allow them to steer at a sufficient distance and without direct visibility.  This spy technique! <br><br>  However, the drone went through customs and landed on March 22 at the EMS warehouse, from where I took it. <br><br>  Bottom line: Parrot AR.Drone flew to me 18 days, not without incident.  Sum of costs: <br>  (drone cost: $ 299.99) + (Shipito.com services: $ 8.5 + $ 8.5) + (USPS delivery: $ 86.57) = $ 403.56 <br><br>  This weekend we plan to conduct the first tests of the copter, so after a while I will try to tell in detail about the drone itself :) Taking this opportunity, I would like to find in Moscow other owners of Parrot AR.Drone - all the ‚Äúaugmented-real‚Äù games are designed for the participation of two quadcopters.  So if you have Parrot AR.Drone and you are tired of chasing it alone - write in a personal! <br><br>  Several links on the topic: <br>  <a href="http://ardrone.parrot.com/parrot-ar-drone/uk/ar-games">Games videos for AR.Drone</a> <br>  <a href="http://ardrone.parrot.com/parrot-ar-drone/dev/developers">Developer Corner</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/116558/">https://habr.com/ru/post/116558/</a></p>
