Then he tried to get up, but failed - my body, like a bag of sand, fell on the carpet.  I remember the first thought that occurred to me then: ‚ÄúI'll be late for the stand-up‚Äù.  There was no fear that the body could fall down for no reason at all.  Having straightened out on my arms, I climbed back onto the bed and tried to get up again - my body did not listen well and after taking two steps, I again fell to the floor.  My head was foggy and my thoughts were confused, but still I thought of writing to my manager that I would be late for work, and maybe I would not even come, but I would come tomorrow.  Instead of one day, I returned to work after three weeks: for two weeks I lay stupidly on the sofa, it was difficult to walk, even leaning on the wall, I did not listen to my thoughts (as far as applicable to thoughts), I didn‚Äôt want to, but I made do it yourself, because I knew that it was necessary. <br>  I am sure that you guessed why this happened - I ‚Äúburned out‚Äù at work.  During those ‚Äúfirst‚Äù two weeks that I was lying in bed I had to rethink something and come up with an algorithm that solves the problem of full recovery (as soon as possible) after ‚Äúburning out‚Äù at work. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  The idea to write an article inspired by <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/212323/">this post</a> . <br>  I apologize in advance for the Anglicisms found in the article. <br><br>  The entire following list consists of the mistakes that I made and after correcting which, 95% of my problems are gone.  Also, the entire text with tips can be reduced to one single phrase: ‚Äústop sweating‚Äù (at first I wanted to write the word ‚Äúexperience‚Äù, but it is not exactly a characteristic of what I will try to convey to you).  And now the points.

      Before reading further, I recommend reading <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/197136/">my previous article</a> for a better understanding of the material. <br><br><h4>  Start planning </h4><br>  All of us are very afraid of the unknown, when we do not know what to do, and what will happen next, we thereby ‚Äúwind‚Äù ourselves and our body into excitement.  When we have a plan, we are not afraid: we know exactly what needs to be done and what we need to achieve our goal. <br><blockquote>  Do you know what I noticed?  No one panics when everything goes according to plan.  Even if the plan is monstrous.  If tomorrow, I tell the press that one of the bandits will die, or the truck with the soldiers will blow up, no one will panic, because this is all part of the plan.  But when I say that some miserable mayor will die, everyone loses his head.  Just a little bit of anarchy.  Violation of the established order, and everything around is plunged into chaos.  I am the carrier of chaos.  Do you know what is the basis of chaos?  This is fear. <br>  "Joker" from the film "The Dark Knight" </blockquote><br><br>  Example: no one is worried when he makes tea for himself - he always ‚Äúkeeps‚Äù in his head what to do to get the desired drink.  But put a person with driving experience behind the wheel and ask to make a diagonal parking (at the same time threaten that if he does not do this, he will be punished) - you can be sure, he will start to worry and make a lot of mistakes - because he does not have a plan (rather an algorithm) what actions need to be done to counter the unknown punishment.  The example is exaggerated, but I think you understood what was going on.  <b>Hence the conclusion: learn to plan.</b> <br>  <b>How to solve it:</b> Of course, not plan all things, no matter how much you want to.  But 90% of the time of your life can be planned and this is not at all as difficult as it seems.  The same applies to work: teach yourself, coming to the workplace, the first thing to do is to plan your day.  Come, sit at the table and devote twenty minutes of time, paint by the hour (given the error) what you plan to do.  Thus, for each day you will have a plan reflecting what you need to do, and, as a result, you will never have any anxiety, something is not done or not taken into account. <br>  Of course, there are things that are beyond our control.  For example, you made an implicit error in the code, commited it to production and it went down.  Your team lead comes to you and says "you put the food on, let's fix it and fix it faster, this is very important!"  The most frequent reaction is panic.  Don't do that.  It would be more reasonable to consider this in a section: ‚Äúproduction fell, it‚Äôs just a case, which in itself is another task that needs to be solved correctly‚Äù.  But the excitement overpowers you and your thoughts are confused, your hands are shaking, and you do not know how to rule it all out of this, after all, aaaaa !!!  This implies the next item. <br><br><br><h4>  Stop worrying </h4><br>  Man is so constituted that much of what he has is habits.  Good or bad habits.  And habits, as we know, the body acquires over time, until they become unconscious reactions to one or another external stimulus.  Running in the morning \ smoking \ scratching your head is all habits.  Excitement is also a habit.  Especially excitement when something is not working. <br>  <b>How to solve it:</b> every time when you realize that you start to worry, and your hands trembled, stand still;  if you walk, slow down or stop;  if you breathe often - take control of the breath;  if your thoughts are out of control - stop thinking about everything and think about cats (or what you like).  The main thing - to bring the body out of the state of "chaos", when you do not control every feeling.  Next, you need to focus on the thought that caused your excitement.  When you are focused, it will become clear to you that the situation has already happened, and nothing will change.  Having reconciled with this, you should understand that there are only three possible scenarios for the future: <br>  1. <b>You do everything to improve the situation.</b> <br>  2. You do everything to make the situation worse <br>  3. You are not doing anything, and waiting for what will happen (the worst option) <br><br>  That is, you can no longer change the situation itself, but the consequences are completely. <br>  A person is very frightened by the unknown, when he does not know what to do and what will be further than the most ‚Äúwinding up‚Äù himself and his body for even greater excitement.  In our case, we know what to do - we must do everything to improve the situation.  At the same time, it is worth remembering that before you do something, you need to plan it.  Therefore it is necessary: ‚Äã‚Äãcalm down, accept the fact that something has happened and sit in complete peace of mind to plan how you will resolve the situation. <br>  As mentioned above, we cannot foresee everything, but we can summarize everything that cannot be provided for in a separate category of ‚Äúunforeseen affairs‚Äù.  10% of the cases that happen you want it or not.  You just need to take it easy.  The main thing in all this is to stop taking emotional part in the problem.  If you don‚Äôt know what to do and start thinking ‚Äúwhat will they think of me‚Äù, stop doing it right now.  Especially chase the thought: and if I do not have time, oh, my God, what then will be, ahhh how scary it is.  The result: shaking hands, headache and poor sleep, and, as a result, inhibition with the timing of the task.  The solution to this problem is the following paragraph. <br><br><h4>  Replace anxiety with analysis </h4><br>  When a problem (task) arises, a frequent reaction is fear / fear / panic that you have no idea how to solve the problem.  I already wrote this in the previous article, but I will repeat this story again, as very revealing: <br>  Garry Kasparov, the world chess champion, was once asked how many moves ahead he thinks in a game when planning the next move.  The questioners thought that he would give some impressive figure, and then they would understand what makes him the winner.  But what was said to them showed people that they misunderstand even the essence of the game: ‚ÄúThe main thing in chess is not how many moves ahead you think, but how well you analyze the current situation.‚Äù <br>  The essence of this method is that, without knowing the whole situation objectively, people begin to calculate options that are initially erroneous.  And since it is not possible to calculate everything, the turn to the correct moves never reaches.  As a result, we choose the best option from the worst.  The best of those that we tried so carefully to consider. <br>  By applying the same strategy to life, one can understand how often we, instead of objectively assessing what is happening, try to calculate the moves in advance, and how often later these moves turn out to be directed not forward, but somewhere to the side. <br>  To clearly understand the real situation is to make the options open themselves.  He who says that he does not know what to do next, just does not know what is happening to him now. <br>  In other words, we cannot understand the current situation. <br>  <b>How to solve it:</b> start analyzing the task.  Write on the leaflet all the thoughts that you are puzzled when they ask you how to solve this problem.  When all the questions are written, once again stop yourself and think about how you could answer them.  For example, for each question you will have from zero to three answers. <br>  Read each of your answers again and think which of these answers is definitely wrong.  Cross them out of the list.  It may well happen that in more than half of the questions you can answer yourself and everything will become much easier.  Remaining questions for discussion with wiser colleagues. <br>  And here a miracle happens - you stop worrying, the brain cannot worry while it analyzes.  It's just biology - as long as you occupy the brain with one thing, it cannot do another.  Logically, the less time we think about work, the less we will have to plan, hence the next point. <br><br><h4>  Share time </h4><br>  Start simple: divide your time into business time and your own.  Working hours are the eight hours you spend at work.  As soon as eight o'clock is over, you no longer belong to the project, or to the boss, or to the fact that ‚Äúproduction is on fire‚Äù.  For those who are already indignantly indignant in their souls: ‚Äúhow is it not to pay attention to the lying procashn‚Äù, let me remind you of the previous points: you must understand that this happened because it happened.  In this situation, we must act as always: we have a task, we need to solve it.  If we worry and be nervous, this will not lead to anything good (Nerves add errors). <br>  <b>How to solve it:</b> today, when you come home, stop thinking about work.  As soon as you went beyond the threshold of the office, the work ceased to exist.  You think only about yourself and your affairs.  A very good practice is to remove work mail from your phone, and ideally get rid of everything that binds you to work.  Work at work, home - at home. <br>  The brain is so arranged that the subconscious will still be ‚Äúin the background‚Äù to solve such problems.  And if the problem is solved, the subconscious will find the answer.  You should not intentionally load your head with extraneous thoughts when their time has not come.  Let me clarify my words: when you go to the cinema at the weekend, say, you go to the cinema - there‚Äôs no thought in your head, like, "You need to call an electrician to transfer sockets";  when you are in the car, your attention is only on the road, and not about how to get rid of the Legacy code, which has already been a year for the whole soul. <br>  Even if you are the head of the project, and if you‚Äôve got it, take it easy (but I think that if you have reached the main point, you yourself are well aware of what needs to be done) <br><br><h4>  Stop being human to all </h4><br>  For example, you have a person who constantly asks for help.  In every detail.  You help a person one, another, tenth time.  Thereby encouraging his behavior.  And as a result, he asks more and more, and you cannot refuse him, because you feel sorry for him and want to help.  As a result, you do not have time with your tasks and spend your nerves on other people's problems. <br>  <b>How to solve it:</b> train yourself to relate to some things happening at work, cynically.  You can not encourage this behavior, a person begins to quickly become impudent and any problem again to ask you.  Become a cynic to such colleagues - does not work, figure it out yourself.  Three months have passed, and you are still fakapish, without even thinking about making any efforts to go bust yourself?  I think it's time we stop cooperating.  Do not take on the cares of others - everyone has their own responsibilities that must be respected, you do not need constant other people's problems. <br><br><h4>  Brief conclusions </h4><br>  Summing up, once again go through all the points: <br>  1. <b>Start planning</b> - when everything goes according to plan, you are calm as there is no scary uncertainty ahead <br>  2. <b>Stop worrying</b> - excitement adds bugs <br>  3. <b>Replace anxiety with analysis</b> - learn not to be afraid of the problem, but to analyze it.  When the brain is busy analyzing, he has no time to worry. <br>  4. <b>Separate time</b> - learn to think only about one thing at a time <br>  5. <b>Stop being human to everyone</b> - do not shoulder other people's problems, you are not Mother Teresa <br><br>  The methods described in the article will be difficult for the unprepared person to perceive and implement.  But when you succeed in fully complying with these five points, you will realize that you will never succeed in burning out at work. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/212741/">https://habr.com/ru/post/212741/</a></p>
