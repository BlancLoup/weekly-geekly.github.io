  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Best in class in terms of price-quality ratio - Mpow A5 (059)</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Mpow, if not the most famous manufacturer of budget headphones, then certainly very popular.  With their low ambitions in terms of price, they invariably give comfortable designs with good sound.  Today we will take a closer look at the model, which in Russia is localized as Mpow A5. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/8w/fu/sy/8wfusyaowotamzjlk15xadtwvvc.jpeg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  First of all, I must say that this is still the same best-seller with Aliexpress and Amazon - Mpow 059, which, in general, has proven itself well, which is confirmed by reviews and user reviews.  Despite the fact that for such constructions it seems to be ‚Äúnot the season‚Äù: everyone wants TWS, A5 is bought. <br><br>  This is a closed-type headphones with passive noise isolation.

    <img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/tx/-z/nh/tx-znhpuvaiegysqa3kmuqr3_6q.jpeg"><br><br>  Despite the seemingly bulky size, they sit comfortably and comfortably on their heads. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/xf/17/_a/xf17_a_e9w87_oc5gt8yd951qqy.jpeg"><br><br>  Ear cushions completely cover the auricles, which provides isolation of external sounds, and - as a result - the best immersion in content. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/zl/uf/mb/zlufmbnqi0lhoqlvbjw4ntjcjxg.jpeg"><br><br>  Discomfort during landing is not felt.  The ear cushions are soft, with a memory effect.  The speakers are movable, which provides a better fit. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/f7/e9/il/f7e9ilsdro06ctsxsgdypvv7ofo.gif"><br><br>  The outer part of the construction is made of simple plastic, but inside, in the place of contact with the head there is a soft lining.  In general, in terms of convenience and ease, this model can be said to be on top.  In size, of course, it is also regulated. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/qg/5x/oj/qg5xojrvxkduym_vukygry2_zxe.jpeg"><br><br>  <b>Management and connection</b> <br><br>  Model A5, as the now-defunct <a href="https://habr.com/ru/company/medgadgets/blog/373263/">Thor</a> model, is able to connect via wire and without it.  And in this we must recognize one of the virtues.  Despite the autonomy that is stated - up to 20 hours without a break, the battery is somehow finite.  If there are no sockets nearby, then the headphones can be connected over the wire and continue to listen to music. <br><br>  Jack connector - on the left speaker, charging connector - on the right. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/te/-v/em/te-vemrsbmcwwkcxw2-r2cqnhw4.jpeg"><br><br>  All the necessary wires, of course, included. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/rg/md/-r/rgmd-rirjpxjslpd1cnwzxt0ike.jpeg"><br><br>  All the controls are located on the right speaker: here on / off, volume and page turning. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/v5/rf/zw/v5rfzwum_gsupsv8bt0_rdynl1y.jpeg"><br><br>  The controls are fairly simple, but may require some getting used to. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/zx/vf/0t/zxvf0tryqxjfcyzzpbovozhg7io.jpeg"><br><br>  The volume and track control buttons have no notches and represent a uniform smooth circle. <br><br>  <b>If the headphones need to throw in the bag</b> <br><br>  One of the advantages of this model is that they add up. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/wq/z-/x4/wqz-x431onsevaypnz_dpzda1ko.jpeg"><br><br>  Frankly, the size does not save at times, but makes the headphones much more compact and safer.  They can either simply be thrown into a bag / backpack, or additionally hidden in a complete pouch. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/84/fv/_7/84fv_7icffzlepswtz1dky_lqzw.jpeg"><br><br>  Summarizing the design as a whole, it can be noted that the model is made of simple materials, but rather qualitatively.  Glossy plastic on top will collect prints, but it is easy to wipe.  Inside the headband has a soft lining.  The speakers themselves reliably and comfortably sit on the ears, do not crush and do not cause discomfort during long wear. <br><br>  An excellent solution in versatility: the headphones work both wired and wireless, which in different conditions can be convenient in its own way.  At the same time, there is no particular difference in sound, which is noted by the majority of reviews and reviews. <br><br>  <b>How to sound</b> <br><br>  From the official information it follows that the headphones are able to provide Hi-Fi sound due to the closed design, which minimizes noise, CSR chip and 40 mm.  driver. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/x9/ru/ek/x9ruekcxpsmy44qjczgk7vobali.jpeg"><br><br>  At the same time, it should be said that in general, the sound is the positive side of Mpow, and most of the headphones from sports to TWS, with which we met earlier, sounded very decent.  A5 is no exception. <br><br>  We, perhaps, agree with most of the reviews, as well as with the characteristics of the official site.  It is characterized mainly as a good bass, a balanced middle and a good detailing of the upper range, which together makes the headphones genre-versatile from hip-hop to pop. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/jp/hz/-i/jphz-ivqdgm09g6c-ioznigtdla.png"><br><br>  Enough detailed analysis presented <a href="https://www.rtings.com/headphones/reviews/mpow/059-wireless">here</a> . <br><br>  <b>Sit comfortably, sound good, what else?</b> <br><br>  Headphone design is modest, but comfortable and practical.  It does not cause special concerns for the design, but there are no extra beautiful things here.  The only thing you can play with is colors: the headphones are presented in red and gray shades. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/3z/jy/9t/3zjy9tb9gcbp6v9vi6gq2y67ily.jpeg"><br><br>  The difference does not appear across the whole body: the outer part of the headband is the same black plastic.  Gray color only inside and around the area of ‚Äã‚Äãattachment of ear cushions. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/d6/1l/qu/d61lqu8d3sh25kgdtigcmdl5pk0.jpeg"><br><br>  In terms of performance, equipment, sound, etc., both models are absolutely identical. <br><br>  <b>Instead of conclusion</b> <br><br>  Mpow is a good brand with a good reputation, which is popular in Russia, in China, and in the Western market.  Through the efforts of quite large bloggers, such as AnboxTerapy, the brand's gadgets beat records on Amazon, and through the efforts of our YouTube users, Alik is growing.  The problem with pricing in Russia still persists ... <br><br>  We can correct this injustice locally - with a discount of 30% <b>HABRA5</b> (valid until 07/21/19), the model will cost on average similar to world prices.  <a href="https://medgadgets.ru/shop/mpow-059.html%3Futm_source%3Dhabr%26utm_medium%3Dmpow%26utm_campaign%3Da5">Buy Mpow A5 can be here</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/459328/">https://habr.com/ru/post/459328/</a></p>
