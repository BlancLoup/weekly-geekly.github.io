The ideologist and the main organizer of the conference is the well-known activist of this topic - <a href="http://alenapopova.ru/">Alyona Popova</a> . <br><br>  Probably the most famous participant in this conference is State Duma Deputy Ilya Ponomarev, who popularizes the topic of developing systems of interaction between citizens and the state.  His presence and active participation show the level of the event and demonstrate that there is some obvious activity in this area.  The essence of which I will try to convey to you in this article. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  So, the conference is dedicated to practitioners.  Those.  The projects of the conference participants were of little interest.  More talked about what has been done.  What turned out to be an unsuccessful attempt, and what and how can be developed and replicated. <br><br>  In the opening section of the conference, as always, a lot of common words were said, but one report deserves attention.  Sergey Yurkevich, executive secretary of the Commission for the Development of the Information Society with the plenipotentiary representative of the President of the Russian Federation in the Central Federal District, did it.  He talked about how work is going on the organization of interdepartmental document circulation and providing citizens and organizations access to government services via the Internet.

      Regarding the provision of public services in electronic form, he said that there is a formal transition plan (which was approved by government decree No. 1555), according to which ‚Äúby 1 December 2015, such services as: <br><ul><li>  work searches; </li><li>  registration of personal documents; </li><li>  announcement of the change of residence; </li><li>  car registration; </li><li>  submission of applications to the government; </li><li>  admission to universities; </li><li>  receiving social assistance; </li><li>  civil registration; </li><li>  health care services; </li><li>  filing statements to the police; </li><li>  registration of taxes; </li><li>  (for some reason) access to public libraries. ‚Äù </li></ul><br>  If we talk about the interaction with legal entities, then get here: <br><ul><li>  submission of statistical data; </li><li>  filing of customs declarations; </li><li>  social contributions to employees; </li><li>  corporate taxes; </li><li>  company registration; </li><li>  VAT registration; </li><li>  obtaining permits related to environmental protection. </li></ul><br>  In addition, Yurkevich often used the term of providing the service "in a transactional form", explaining this as the possibility of not only submitting an application, but also tracking its processing and getting the result. <br><br>  Then Yurkevich spoke about the need to organize interdepartmental document circulation for effective collaboration.  In order not to send data "through the top", and work directly.  He noted that today information systems of various departments are incompatible and work is underway to place them ‚Äúin a single project field‚Äù.  At present, there are already 15 protected channels that provide work for 28 state.  services in electronic form.  The remaining services are provided by the state portal. <br><br>  The transfer of services is organized at 3 levels: federal, regional and budget, and in 5 stages: <br><ul><li>  Stage 1: information on the website of public services; </li><li>  Stage 2: the ability to download the form; </li><li>  Stage 3: the ability to apply online; </li><li>  Stage 4: the portal allows you to track the execution of the application; </li><li>  Stage 5: services are fully electronic. </li></ul><br>  In total, 74 state services from 20 priority categories should be provided. <br><br>  Some information from the report about the public services portal itself: <br><ul><li>  launched December 15, 2009; </li><li>  19 departments provide their services; </li><li>  50 services are already provided (out of 74 in accordance with Decree No. 1555); </li><li>  April 1 (and this is not a joke! Although symbolic;) 2010, the registration of citizens in the personal account started; </li><li>  170 thousand registered users; </li><li>  about 32 thousand users visit the portal daily </li></ul><br>  So I tried to convey a brief squeeze on the status of the topic today with the words of Sergei Yurkevich. <br><br>  During the conference, the importance of two upcoming events in the field of e-government was noted: the formation of a law on an electronic document that should allow to transfer work into electronic form (today the law requires duplicating all documents in paper form without fail, followed by archiving according to the specified schemes, different institutions), and a decree obliging the authorities to process applications received from citizens in electronic form on the appropriate channels.  am. <br><br>  If Habraobschestvennost expresses interest, I will provide a recording of Yurkevich‚Äôs speech in audio format.  In the meantime, I do not quite understand how to place it here (file in .apk format). <br><br>  Then the participants went into two halls.  In the first, the section ‚ÄúProvision of state services in electronic form‚Äù worked, and in the second, ‚ÄúOfficial 2.0: use of social media by civil servants‚Äù and ‚ÄúCivil initiatives, crowdsourcing and non-state projects‚Äù.  It seemed to me, ‚Äúfor officials‚Äù and ‚Äúfor mere mortals‚Äù.  I joined the second. <br><br>  The section was divided, as I have already noted, into two parts.  In the first, officials told about the experience of using ‚Äúmodern information technologies‚Äù in their work.  That turns out, and that goes badly. <br><br>  The second part of the section was devoted to the presentation of civil projects working at the junction with the authorities.  In fact, not all of these projects turned out to be such projects, but all of them somehow concerned the organization of people around the solution of common problems. <br><br>  The program of the event can be <a href="http://gov2russia.ru/program/">viewed on the conference website</a> .  If you click on the section name, a detailed program will open.  If you are interested in something related to specific projects, ask questions in the comments, and I will be happy to answer them.  I do not want to bother you with reading detailed reports, I have more than 5 hours of audio material and more notes that I was able to do during the reports. <br><br>  In addition to the note, I propose to read the report on the event of the main organizer Alena Popova <a href="http://www.alenapopova.ru/gov20/egov-2-0-prodolzhenie-sleduet.html">on her personal blog</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/109016/">https://habr.com/ru/post/109016/</a></p>
