When a person, for example, says that he bought his Aviasales ticket, then from a technical point of view this is not true.  Because he bought a ticket from an agent, where he was sent by Aviasales or any other metasearch.  The agent also accepted the money for the ticket.  He is responsible for it.  Corner is a meta search engine. <br><br>  We have no commission, because we do not make money on agency commissions, like the same Skyscanner, Momondo.  We earn on commissions from Automated Booking Systems (CRS, they are also GDS, global distribution system), because unlike others, we search for tickets not through agents, but directly through GDS.  It is very important to share.  The agent pays us nothing, your order is free for him. <br><br>  We have a good bet, because the way we look for tickets, no one in the world has ever done. <br><br>  <i>- Brave claim.</i>  <i>What is the difference, for example, Corner from Skyscanner?</i> <br>  - Suppose, in theory, Skyscanner is connected to three agents OneTwoTrip, Tripsta, Tiket.ru. <br>  Skyscanner sends each request: "Give me Moscow-Paris prices for February 3." <br>  Total, it turns out three requests to agents. <br><br>  Those in turn make exactly the same requests to the GDS servers.  Well this is pure load animation!  And if the agents are 15 and more, then the load increases to the skies.  This is stupid! <br>  Corner does one ONE request to the GDS.  Compare the search speed with us and others.  You will not be surprised.  You will be surprised how Corner instantly switches to search results. <br><br>  We, without false modesty, were the first in the world to take data from the GDS directly, and then only to interview agents: <br>  ‚ÄúAgents, we have tickets Moscow ‚Äì Paris for February 3 and we know their price in the GDS.  How much are you ready to write to our users? ‚Äù <br><br>  Full interview <a href="http://www.iphones.ru/iNotes/388804">here</a> . <br><br><h4>  Open source </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f76/e90/4f6/f76e904f6bd82bf1430b67a7258116eb.png" alt="image"><br>  Standards are a headache in trevel.
