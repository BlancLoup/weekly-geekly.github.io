The success of any conference depends largely on the content, and properly selected content is the task of the program director.  We decided to make a series of articles on behalf of those who make the section the way the participants will see it. <br><br>  Our first post is from Darya Bakirova, program director of the Analytics section, an analyst from Technology 2000, about what she expects from the conference, why go to it, and what will be interesting in the section. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/78f/566/72e/78f56672e06c4d22e05e4128acd8f725.jpg" alt="image"><h5>  Daria Bakirova, Program Director, Analytics Section </h5>

      At first glance, many IT conferences are being held in Yekaterinburg now.  But almost all of them are devoted to one or another aspect of development.  It seems that system analysis is some kind of exotic type of activity in it, because all the activity of analysts is concentrated in Moscow and St. Petersburg.  There are many training events, specialized conferences and just informal analytical parties.  But there are a lot of analysts in Yekaterinburg! <br><br>  I also really want to participate in these events, but it is not always possible to spend a few working days on a trip to another city.  I dreamed of the Ekaterinburg community since I began working as an analyst.  And it seems that now it is being implemented: together with Julia Zaks and IT-People, we have come up with and conducted systems analysis courses, and now I can communicate with former cadets in a close friendly circle;  there used to be no analytical section on DUMP ‚îÄ and now we are going to hold it for the first time.  In my opinion, communication between analysts can potentially give a lot to every specialist.  Analytics is diverse, I believe that there are no clear rules for system (and business) analytics, and working for a long time in one place, it is easy to develop your own patterns and focus on them, although in reality they may not be very effective. <br><br>  That is why I, from our section, first of all wait for new acquaintances, discussions, clues for self-education.  Not so long ago, I read an article on Habr√© that conferences are now turning into recreational activities.  I don't mind: for me, the whole point of the conference is in this.  I don‚Äôt think that in 30-40 minutes of a report you can really teach something.  But you can give a push, interest in a book, idea or technology.  I need the conference to shake the brain and re-admire my work.  Expand the boundaries of the world.  People want an intellectual show, and for self-education now there are plenty of opportunities both on the Internet and outside it.  That is why I am going to poison bikes on my report: I will invite my analytic friend, with whom we donated TK to various large customers in accordance with GOST, and recall with her selected moments, those who wish can join the discussion and tell us their stories.  When we spontaneously began to rehearse this conversation in a cafe, we became so animated that it seemed that even people who were not involved in it were interested.  Or, I really like the summary of Denis Beskov's report on non-functional requirements: ‚ÄúFor those who wrote in the ToR,‚Äú the system should be intuitive ‚Äù‚îÄ and it was garbage.  Those who wrote in the TZ, that "any screen should be reachable in no more than 3 clicks" ‚îÄ and it was garbage.  Those who are still awake are tossing and turning and thinking how it was possible to avoid bullshit. ‚Äù  Probably every practicing analyst sees in these words something native. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/65c/d81/803/65cd81803c98e345c3da0f4e5e11d203.jpg" alt="image"><h5>  Section speakers: D. Beskov, D. Bakirova, N. Zhelnova, G. Pechenkin, I. Novikov </h5><br><br>  Of course, we tried to strike a balance: we will have very serious reports.  For example, Natalya Zhelnova will talk about how to measure the effectiveness of the analyst‚Äôs work, what metrics can be applied and what it can lead to (‚ÄúHorror from the life of it-companies‚Äù sounds intriguing). <br><br>  On the section will be presented both analysts from the field of custom development, and from the product.  Igor Novikov from Naumen (who for me is, above all, a product-oriented company) will give a report on product development experience based on custom projects.  For me it is very important: almost all the companies in which I worked, with varying success, tried to combine their best development into a kind of core.  And I do not remember a single ‚Äúcore‚Äù that I would have liked. <br><br>  No less interesting to me and the performance of Grigory Pechenkin.  His report is devoted to the work of an analyst in an Internet project: how do analyst tasks in this case differ from tasks in ‚Äútraditional development‚Äù.  Somehow, in times of relative lack of money, I started writing TK and formulating requirements for online stores and portals in parallel with working in large projects.  First for friends, and then for everyone.  Of course, I found a lot of rakes.  Now it is interesting for me to compare them with the rake that (perhaps) Gregory found.  Moreover, nowadays a very complex CIS (* corporate information system) can simultaneously be an Internet project. <br><br>  I hope our section will be interesting and fun.  Come and do not hesitate to actively participate in discussions. <br><br>  All reports and abstracts of the section can be found <a href="http://dump-it.ru/sections/analitika14/">here</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/214767/">https://habr.com/ru/post/214767/</a></p>
