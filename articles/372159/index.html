They found him by chance - the Belgian, being the favorite of the race, left the race for technical reasons, and her bike was examined by experts.  She herself argued that the <s>moped is not my</s> bike belongs to her friend, and the bikes themselves are the same.  Allegedly carelessly Femke Van Den Driesch took a friend's bike with an electric motor, not her own, without any ‚Äútechnical doping‚Äù.

      They dealt with this case for quite a long time, and in the course of the proceedings all new facts of the use of electric motors by professional cyclists emerged.  So, journalists with the help of a thermal imager <a href="https://geektimes.ru/post/274562/">were able to detect the</a> hidden electric motors in various parts of bicycles of athletes who participated in two Italian bicycle races in March of this year. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Rumors of technological doping began to circulate among cyclists since 2010, when athlete Fabian Cancellara was accused of ‚Äútechnological fraud‚Äù.  Then one of the technical experts claimed that a small electric motor with a capacity of from 60 to 100 watts was working in an athlete's bicycle.  Despite the fact that the motor is low-powered, it helped the cyclist to improve efficiency. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/e0s2yo6ws9U%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700021,15700043,15700186,15700191,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhjcagKJvQEPOTUKgxI1UIYbWaURaA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  Now it is no longer rumors, and the facts - some athletes really cheat, and not outsiders are doing this.  Electric motors are installed in various places.  There are even designs where bicycles are equipped with wheels with neodymium magnets.  And the coil placed under the seat generates an induction EMF, which adds about 60 watts of power to the athlete.  All this is regulated by wireless. <br><br>  As for the Belgian, the design of her bike was not too complicated.  With the help of magnetic resonance scanning, the battery and the Vivax engine were detected in the seat tube.  Activated system using Bluetooth.  The controller was located in the steering wheel. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/42a/d2c/656/42ad2c65690f3defde54a689fc86638e.jpg"><br>  <i>Photo: AFP / Getty Images</i> <br><br>  As a result, the <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2016/04/26/cyclist-banned-for-six-years-after-racing-with-a-hidden-motor/">athlete was disqualified until 2021</a> .  As it turned out, she cheated not only during one race, the fraud began a long time ago, although only fraud was proven during one season.  As a result, a special commission deprived her of the medals received at this time, as well as prize money.  In addition, the athlete was fined $ 20,569. <br><br>  Disqualification Belgian - the first of its kind.  The President of the International Cycling Union, Brian Cookson, has already said that this is not the last case of ‚Äúexcommunication‚Äù of an athlete from the competition due to technology fraud.  <a href="http://www.uci.ch/pressreleases/the-uci-announces-disciplinary-commission-decision-the-case-femke-van-den-driessche/">Cookson has promised</a> to conduct a thorough investigation and scan the bikes of many athletes participating in this year‚Äôs competition. <br><br>  Earlier, however, he also claimed that there is no convincing evidence of the presence of electric motors in the bikes of athletes that were filmed by Italian journalists. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/372159/">https://habr.com/ru/post/372159/</a></p>
