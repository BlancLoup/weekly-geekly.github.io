Many people accumulate hundreds of business tips, but cannot establish a profitable company.  And the point is not that this knowledge is bad.  The fact is that a successful business is a reflection of an entrepreneur with certain properties.  What kind  I selected 5 books that answer this question. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  How to achieve their own, no matter what </h2><br>  Ayn Rand ‚ÄúAtlas Shrugged‚Äù <br><br>  In the world of bureaucracy, weakness and laziness, a person who is ready to take responsibility faces difficulties as it goes against everyone.

      The Ayn Rand book provides important entrepreneurial skills: responsibility, dedication and perseverance.  In spite of the fact that the book ‚ÄúAtlas Shrugged‚Äù was first published in 1957, it is still relevant today.  The actions of the main characters admire and give an understanding of who the entrepreneur. <br><br>  ‚Üí Download the book: <a href="https://www.alpinabook.ru/catalog/BusinessNovels/65392/%3Fav%3D1">alpinabook.ru</a> , <a href="https%253A%252F%252Fwww.litres.ru%252Fayn-rend%252Fatlant-raspravil-plechi%252F">litres.ru</a> . <br><br><h2>  How to work effectively </h2><br>  David Allen ‚ÄúHow to put things in order‚Äù <br><br>  Inefficient and at the same time successful entrepreneurs do not exist.  You either delegate authority and build a personal work schedule, or immerse yourself in the routine of other people's problems. <br><br>  The effectiveness of a manager is not determined by the knowledge of the Pomodoro technique or the frequency of use of the timer.  Efficiency - the ability to do their job qualitatively and, as far as possible, quickly.  David Allen's bestseller talks about how to do this. <br><br>  ‚Üí Download book: <a href="http%253A%252F%252Fwww.mann-ivanov-ferber.ru%252Fbooks%252Fmif%252Fgettingthingsdone%252F">mann-ivanov-ferber.ru</a> . <br><br><h2>  Bible entrepreneur </h2><br>  Steve Blank and Bob Dorf ‚ÄúStartup: Founder Handbook‚Äù <br><br>  Step-by-step development plan for the company, which will force you to put off guesswork and start developing your business in the real world.

Business without prejudice ‚Äù <br><br>  Patterns are part of our world.  In business, too, have their own templates.

Tim refuted the popular axiom, which states that work should be enjoyable and created a new one, the purpose of which is to build a business that does not take much time and start doing what you dream about. <br><br>  ‚Üí Download book: <a href="https%253A%252F%252Fwww.litres.ru%252Ftimoti-ferris%252Fkak-rabotat-po-chetyre-chasa-v-nedelu-2%252F">litres.ru</a> . <br><br><h2>  The path of the entrepreneur.  First step </h2><br>  The entrepreneur assumes risk and responsibility.  He expresses an opinion, defends it with reason and brings it to life.  Begin and you.  Think about what can be improved in the company in which you work or just in your life.  Extend the solution and commit to implement.  Focus.  Do just one thing worthwhile and your approach to work will change forever. <br><br>  Links to previous reviews: <br><br>  " <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/smartprogress/blog/312726/">30 smart books on business, self-development and creativity that changed my life</a> <br>  ¬ª <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/smartprogress/blog/315510/">5 books to help you think outside the box and why it is important right now</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/316894/">https://habr.com/ru/post/316894/</a></p>
