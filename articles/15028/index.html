      - <strong>value</strong> - time spent on starting information, your creation: content, texts, photos, circle of friends, communication groups, etc .; <br>  - <strong>opportunities</strong> - freedom and radius of communication, freedom and radius of movement, the possibility and strength of influence. <br><br>  <strong>Value</strong> creation, <strong>value</strong> measurement, value increase - the sum of ‚Äú+‚Äù. <br>  <strong>Opportunity</strong> is a derivative of <strong>value</strong> . <br><br>  <strong>Value creation in social networks:</strong> <br><blockquote>  - detailed information about yourself "+" <br>  - many friends "+" <br>  - a lot of photos, video "+" <br>  - a lot of unique text "+" <br>  - many replicas "+" <br>  - a lot of time in the network "+" </blockquote><br>  <strong>Add value by user evaluation - value adjustments:</strong> <br><blockquote>  - successful article - rated "+" <br>  - a successful joke out loud - rated "+" <br>  - successful, funny photo - rated "+" <br>  - interesting, useful link - rated by "+" </blockquote><br>  <strong>We reduce the value - user rating:</strong> <br><blockquote>  - stupid, vulgar joke out loud - rated "-" <br>  - obscene photo - rated "-" </blockquote><br><br>  The user has a high level of <strong>value</strong> , therefore, he will get more <strong>opportunities</strong> in the network, more communication radius, more freedom of publication, greater access to sections and greater weight of the assessment being made. <br><br>  The network encourages: high-quality content, good mood, cultural communication. <br><br>  Incorrect behavior: the value level is down;  opportunity and freedom down;  keep silent in public places;  do not enter foreign groups;  others do not grade. <br><br>  The social network becomes a self-regulating organization.  There is a control lever and influence, although users remain anonymous offline. <br><br>  <strong>Now you can build a business</strong> <br><br>  The nature of a social network is a network created for users, and they are its main value.  This means that the business of a network cannot conflict with users; a business of a network is only possible when it is directly valuable to users. <br>  If you fill the network with advertising - this is against users, they do not want this, users will say ‚ÄúGoodbye!‚Äù To the network. <br><br>  <strong>We do business for users</strong> <br><br>  Make a standard store account online.  We invite stores to the network.  BUT! <br>  We are building the first in the world shopping gallery for the BUYER! <br>  The social network on its territory establishes its own rules of trade - <strong>‚ÄúThe correct rules of trade‚Äù - :</strong> <br><br><blockquote>  - the store can not advertise goods; <br>  - the product is gaining a rating by the customers; <br>  - product rating consists of two parts: ‚Äúbefore purchase‚Äù, ‚Äúafter purchase‚Äù; <br>  - shop sellers get rating by customer rating; <br>  - store rating - a derivative of the sum of the ratings of goods and sellers; <br>  - the store owner does not need to spend money on advertising, but rather on high-quality service, assortment, good price level and rent; <br>  - product and store rating - the best and most effective advertising !; <br>  - we attach a piece of the forum to each store and product <br>  for discussion, with a visual difference "before purchase" and "after purchase". </blockquote><br><br>  As Tom Peters assures, women make up 55% of all purchases! <br>  So let's make shops for them! <br>  Those.  shopping is supposed to be a show, an adventure, a party, a game ... <br>  Here, purchases should be made not through tabular analysis of the strong and weak properties of the product (this is for us, men), but through communication and through impressions. <br><br>  <strong>Description of the walk through the gallery of proper trading:</strong> <br><br>  Anyone can invite others to the company for a shopping trip.  At the same time, users become as if connected, i.e.  if one of the users poked at the store, then everyone in the company gets into it, if he poked at the product, then everyone considers it (the push-pull).  At the same time, they are discussed in the mode, as in ICQ.  I am sure that it will be ‚Äúfun‚Äù and fun.  Plus, users can ask questions (and maybe bargain with the seller).  Plus, users can see other users in this store and "speak" out loud (when everyone in the store hears), or in a whisper (only their own company hears).  I introduced a few girls to my proposal, and they approved.  In their face score on 5 points.  Going shopping in the company is their favorite activity and stops only the lack of time and difficulty to get offline! <br><br>  <strong>Another important element for trading</strong> <br><br>  You can give any user the opportunity to make money.  For this, the store includes an "independent consultant" option.  Those.  the store invites everyone to become consultants - register at the store and have the opportunity to advise customers upon request.  If a purchase is made and the buyer specifies a consultant, the consultant receives a fixed percentage.  At the same time, the consultant‚Äôs rating is maintained (but not on sales in a particular store, but on the total number of sales), a consultant can register in any number of stores.  Those.  if I understand, for example, in mobile phones, then I‚Äôm in all the stores where they are sold and register, and I don‚Äôt have any difference what exactly will be sold, I will get my percentage in case of sale, and the buyer will get the best advice I can.  The percentage of pay consultants is the same according to the rules of the CTP. <br>  The social network will receive an increase in overall sales.  Shops will receive a large number of consultants for certain goods or types of goods - consultants who may well be much more qualified in this narrow area than sellers because their experience and knowledge is consumer knowledge. <br><br>  In order for all this to function, the following network regulators are needed: <br><blockquote>  - making purchases "+"; <br>  - evaluation of the goods before the purchase of "+", if it coincides with the general opinion; <br>  - evaluation of the goods after the purchase of "+", if it coincides with the general opinion; <br>  - inviting friends for shopping "+"; <br>  - evaluation consultant "+"; <br>  - an indication of the consultant when buying a "+"; <br>  - The work of the consultant "+" and the payment of interest. </blockquote><br><br>  To avoid hidden advertising through user ratings, the following mechanism is needed: <br><br><blockquote>  - if the evaluation of the product or store coincides with the general opinion, the user receives a small (the usual ‚Äú+‚Äù); <br>  -with a sharp difference from the average opinion the user gets a big "-". </blockquote><br><br>  Such a scheme in the case of an attempt to artificially raise or lower the rating of a product will lower the value level of this user, and in the case of systematic abuse automatically and quickly bring him to a state of complete incapacity.  Restoration of the value level of the process is quite time-consuming and long, which makes such a scheme of abuse simply unprofitable and allows with a high degree of probability to have the correct user assessment of the goods. <br>  (The concepts of large / ordinary "¬±" is the selection of the appropriate weighting coefficients, which is decided during the design of the portal and later clarified.) <br><br>  <strong>Description of shopping equipment</strong> <br><br>  If the store can and wants to trade online, it's simple.  The user has paid, and therefore, the system understands that he bought this product.  The consultant, if he was, receives his interest (in the form of money for an e-account).  The buyer - an increase in the level of value and the ability to leave your assessment of the product "after purchase".  Seller - your bonus, if it is provided in his office.  Network snaps counter sales and the amount (this is its advertising). <br>  If the store can not trade online.  It does the following: the buyer has made a purchase decision, a card is filled in, where the identifiers are: product, consultant, seller (if there are several of them in the store), discount amount (if agreed before), buyer ID.  (All parameters can be entered automatically, except for a discount, meaning a reduction in labor intensity) and the system issues a unique alphanumeric card code.  The buyer writes it down or prints a card, the system remembers the card, and the store reserves the goods for a specified period.  Next, the buyer goes to the off-line store, presents the code or printout of the card, the off-line-seller opens the card online and marks the purchase on the agreed terms. <br><br>  In the case of sellers' frauds at a discount, the system will allow analyzing this by examining the list of buyers and their value level. <br><br>  <strong>As I see the further development of the situation.</strong> <br><br>  In Russia, several large social networks, perhaps some of them will consider the above described technology to be promising for themselves and take on its implementation.  I want to mention some important points: <br><br>  - of course, the first is sweet; <br><br>  -create conditions to coeff.  values ‚Äã‚Äãhave become so significant that his loss would be worse than the loss of all offline documents; <br><br>  - make the system open for connection of third-party business modules; <br><br>  - make a design for online life; <br><br>  - to make a social network suitable for conducting ordinary business. <br>  In my arsenal there are still thoughts on this topic, if anyone is interested, please contact! <br><br>  <strong>Why did I even write this article?</strong> <br><br>  Let it be my gift to social networks, and also, in fact, I would like to shop at such stores!  But the main task of the article is to become an illustration to the next paragraph. <br><br>  <strong>Attention!!!</strong>  <strong>Over the next year, the direction of Internet development will change dramatically!</strong> <br><br>  1. The Internet will cease to be a garbage and chaos.  <a href="http://www.itechbridge.com/forum/index.php%3Fshowforum%3D822">Self-organization systems will make it a neat and delicate tool.</a> <br>  2. The scheme to gather the crowd and load all the advertising has become obsolete!  Portals will earn directly. <br>  3. <a href="http://slava7.habrahabr.ru/blog/25253.html">Portals will learn to give users to earn</a> . <br><br>  <strong>A time of great change is a time of great opportunity!</strong> <strong><br></strong>  <strong>How not to miss them?</strong>  <strong>I will describe in the <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blog/startup/28305.html">article in a week</a> .</strong> <strong><br></strong> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/15028/">https://habr.com/ru/post/15028/</a></p>
