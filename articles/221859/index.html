  <section class="page js-page"><h1>May 16, a seminar on sales of storage systems will start - ‚ÄúStorage technology and systems for SMB customers‚Äù</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  In February of this year, on the basis of the training center (TC) of the MUK group of companies (Kiev), a unique seminar <i>‚ÄúTechnologies and Storage Systems for SMB Customers‚Äù</i> developed at TC MUK was held for the first time.  Specialists in the field of pre-sales training (presale), working with customers from the category of small and medium business in data storage systems (DSS).  Since the market offers solutions from several key storage vendors at once, the knowledge and practical skills acquired by the listeners were not tied to a specific manufacturing company. <br><br>  On the contrary, for the participants a comparative analysis of relevant product families from different companies was carried out, and already on its basis solutions that were optimal for customers were formed according to the stated requirements.  The participants emphasized the importance of obtaining the skills of personal interaction with customers.  Their development is included in the program of each day of the seminar and is most pronounced on the last day of training, when the creation and protection of a project is modeled before the customer in the mode of teamwork. <br><br>  The workshop is held in two modules, two days each.  With a goal of minimal impact on the schedule of the participants, it was found that the second day of each module is held on Saturdays.  It is tentatively planned that the group will start on May 16, continue to study on May 17, and then complete the training on May 23-24 *.
