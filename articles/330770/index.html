  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How do outdated phone numbers ‚Äúeat up‚Äù business money?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Today, a mobile phone is the key identifier of an individual, and the number of mobile devices has exceeded the population of the planet.  This is the main method of communication with the person and the main channel for the delivery of information. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/5e4/dad/1ec/5e4dad1ecb824895b4da834c1133df91.jpg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The customer contact database is used in any business, both for the purpose of sending important notifications (information about orders, bank card transactions, etc.) and for marketing.  The database is an important company resource.  But there is another side: the bases have a habit of quickly becoming obsolete, and if they are not updated, then instead of revenues they cause losses. <br><br><h2>  How to spoil the database? </h2><br>  Speaking of problems with databases, people first of all recall technical failures.  However, how to fix everything here is very simple: you just need to restore the data from the backup (do you not forget about the backup?). 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>

      In addition to technical reasons, there are other related human factors.  This is not only about the errors of the database operator - although they do happen - but more about the permanent loss of data relevance.  It is important to remember that the database begins to lose relevance at the time of its creation.  By the way, for this reason, the legendary encyclopedia Britannica has <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/books/9142412/Encyclopaedia-Britannica-stops-printing-after-more-than-200-years.html">ceased</a> to go on paper.  It turned out that it became obsolete on the same day when it was printed, and the publishers preferred to switch to the electronic version. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/dd3/c32/043/dd3c320432184e299641f9bbdf53a8dd.jpg"><br>  <i>Panta rhei (Latin - Everything flows, everything changes)</i> <br><br>  In the age of affordable mobile communications and intense competition between operators, numbers quickly become invalid: people change them, the operator transfers numbers to new owners.  Often people lose their phones and cannot restore the number, as a result of which they have to connect a new one.  Someone uses several SIM-cards at once, changing them in the phone as needed.  Someone moves to another country, and someone just gives the wrong number when they do the survey. <br><br>  Several similar errors in the database are not so critical, but over time, a real snowball is growing from them, and as a result, communication and marketing activities lose their effectiveness. <br><br><h2>  What can be done in this situation? </h2><br>  Maintaining the relevance of the database is not easy, especially to track whether the same person is using a specific number or was transferred to a new owner.  However, there is a solution that allows you to quickly analyze the database for the validity / non-validity of numbers, identify ported numbers, inaccessible numbers and numbers in roaming.  One simple operation will save your business from unnecessary expenses. <br><br>  What expenses are we talking about?  The most common situation is sending SMS notifications to inactive numbers.  If the database is small - a couple of tens of thousands of numbers, the losses will be insignificant.  However, medium and large businesses may lose not small sums from month to month. <br><br>  Extra expenses arise in case of incorrect routing of calls and SMS-messages: this often happens when the subscriber changed the service provider, retaining the old number. <br><br>  In addition, losses can be expressed not only in money, but also in lost time: managers sometimes spend a lot of precious time making calls to inactive, inaccessible numbers or roaming.  It is worth mentioning that when calling to numbers that are in roaming, the business actually encroaches on the balance of the subscriber who has to pay for the call.  This will not please him either. <br><br>  Our company provides the <a href="https://www.infobip.com/ru/platforma/rassylki/hlr-proverka-nomera">Check Number</a> service, which allows you to check the relevance of phone numbers worldwide, and it is available both through a personal account and through an <a href="https://dev.infobip.com/docs/number-context">API</a> .  Inactive numbers can be excluded from the database to reduce costs, and in the analytics section you will find information about your database by country, operator, and availability status. <br><br>  From the experience of our clients, we can say that some companies save tens of thousands of dollars a month, thanks to maintaining the base in proper condition. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/330770/">https://habr.com/ru/post/330770/</a></p>
