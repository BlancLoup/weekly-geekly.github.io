  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Beautiful science from "Electro-L"</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Six months ago, I <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/167865/">wrote</a> about the Russian meteorological satellite Electro-L, which has been successfully operating in geostationary orbit for more than two years.  Habra liked the material, and I offered to those who wish to monitor its activities through the <a href="https://vk.com/electrol">Vkontakte</a> group.  Then I promised that I would share here the materials that we collect.  I think it's time to fulfill the promise. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/e48/93d/7bd/e4893d7bd7e0e99b4b8ae96c4dc6e028.jpg"><br>  ( <i>Under the cat gifs 10 mb</i> ) <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Full size on <a href="http://www.gigapan.com/gigapans/122634">GigaPan</a> . <br><br>  The Electro-L spacecraft was built at the NPO im.  S.A.  Lavochkin (the company now also has <a href="https://vk.com/laspace">a VK group</a> ), launched by the Zenit rocket, with the Fregat booster block (RB also Made in Lavochka) two and a half years ago.  It creates images of the Earth with details up to 1 km per pixel every 30 minutes.  Frames are produced in ten spectral ranges, two of which are visible ‚Äî green and blue, followed by near infrared, and seven at different wavelengths of the middle and far infrared ranges.  These observations allow meteorologists to observe the movement of clouds at various altitudes.  But the first three channels create still beautiful photos.

But this light scheme allows you to get more information about the earth's surface.  To return the green in the pictures have to shaman in Photoshop. <br><br>  I consider it a great omission that neither Roskosmos nor Roshydromet make any effort to share this beauty with their people.  Fortunately, almost all the images are in the <a href="http://www.ntsomz.ru/electro/source_images">public domain</a> on the FTP server of the Roskosmos division, the Scientific Center for Earth Operational Monitoring (OMZ). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/2ce/579/8ac/2ce5798ac7686049ca07420806d7c98e.gif" alt="image"><br><br>  Taking advantage of the openness of information, I decided to show by personal example what the meaning of the work of the Roskosmos press service was.  Other users who joined in the work on turning science into beauty were probably guided by other motives, but together with us, I think, it worked out well. <br><br>  For example <a href="http://geektimes.ru/users/sjabberwocky/" class="user_link">SJabberwocky</a> liked the process of creating a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/SayJabberwocky">video</a> .  First, he created videos with the full disk of the Earth. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/PTuztgc8T6s%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700022,15700186,15700191,15700253,15700258&amp;usg=ALkJrhj0xXCd_0_R_rz8kTqnzQNZlv5NSg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  Then he improved the processing procedure and began to select individual fragments. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/-sa01oU6kz4%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700022,15700186,15700191,15700253,15700258&amp;usg=ALkJrhgaYeNdkT-hdxzdav_s20qtnO_sEQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  The idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe next video, we pulled the Europeans.  But there the staff of the space agency worked to show how the illumination of the Earth varies depending on the inclination of the earth's axis.  And this video "Electro-L" was created by an amateur.  And anyway, the video even now carry to schools for the lessons of natural history to show why it is warm in summer and cold in winter and what is polar day and night. <br><br><iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/1u7YVO2aQSA%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700022,15700186,15700191,15700253,15700258&amp;usg=ALkJrhi9zp5iPkV7CqFAyWqn8J5-xMtM8g" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  Other subscribers went a different way - they wrote a program so that everyone could display Electro-L images on their desktop, with updates as new images appeared on the server.  Now you can watch the global weather on your desktop, almost online.  How to do this can be found <a href="https://vk.com/deskchanger">here</a> . <br><br>  It should be noted that the management and technical specialists of NTS OMZ eagerly made contact when we addressed them with requests. <br>  Asked to show the moon - please: <br>  (With the standard image processing scheme, the Moon cannot be seen, because everything superfluous except the Earth's disk is cut off at the program level. Ie, the specialists had to manually dig out the appropriate image in the raw images and put it on the server). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/169/65c/caa/16965ccaa4dbc7236b021b4946ccf409.jpg"><br>  <a href="">1920x1080</a> <a href="">1920x1200</a> <br><br>  They asked to increase the size of the preview from 800 to 1080, so that the image would more conveniently stand on the monitors - that's it. <br>  They asked me to upload a full-format color snapshot not in the archive, but in a folder, along with a preview that facilitates the creation of HD-video - there is. <br><br>  Bow to them for collaboration with space enthusiasts. <br>  Now here's the <a href="https://vk.com/wall-47256091_16706">ISON</a> comet. <br><br>  And I like to do gif-animations.  Thanks to serial shooting from the satellite, they turn out cool. <br>  Best of all, "Electro-L" is able to shoot various atmospheric phenomena.  But he was created in order.  Cyclones and storms are simply awesome: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/117/711/59d/11771159da50989dac0d66125e8d0b76.gif"><br>  <a href="http://allmars.net/photo-hubble-and-others/item/221-tiphoon">Larger size</a> <br><br>  Wanting to expand the audience, which could enjoy such a spectacle, I began to write to various online media, offering to publish gifs. <br><br>  Immediately responded RIA-News.  Their scientific journalist Ilya Ferapontov supported my activities and thanks to him Electro-L was repeatedly published on the RIA website.  Ilya, in fact, is the only journalist who <a href="http://ria.ru/science/20130506/936081519.html">supported</a> our campaign ‚ÄúTo make Roskosmos kinder‚Äù, for which he thanks.  Maybe there was someone else, but, alas, I don't know those.  I have met publications on this topic, only that followed RIA-Novosti. <br><br>  Let me remind you: we asked Roscosmos to speed up the shooting of Electro-L during the passage of a solar eclipse in Australia on May 10.  And, unexpectedly for everyone, <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/179217/">Roskosmos agreed</a> !  The newspaper " <a href="http://trv-science.ru/2013/06/18/sdelat-roskosmos-dobree/">Trinity Option - Science</a> " published material about this story. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/ad5/3a3/0c1/ad53a30c197b5a4222c6dc4a79314910.gif"><br><br>  The animation of the February cyclone Harun was published by <a href="http://ria.ru/eco_news/20130223/924347913.html">RIA-Novosti</a> and <a href="http://www.gazeta.ru/science/video/tsiklon_na_madagaskare.shtml">Gazeta.ru</a> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/23f/656/003/23f656003445948b838ae7a61c1318e8.gif"><br><br>  Here the cyclone itself ‚Äútried‚Äù for us - it brought such destruction to Madagascar that even the Russian media wrote about it, and here our gif turned out to be very useful. <br><br>  One reason to remind about our satellite was presented by NASA.  Their satellite, Terra, shot interesting clouds near Prince Edward Island, southeast of the Cape of Good Hope. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/6a9/7db/7c9/6a97db7c9c6c08efa929c1c10045cd55.jpg"><br><br>  Such unusual cloudy ripples are obtained from the mountains on the island.  For example, a similar wave will come out if you put a thin layer of water on a flat surface, and then put a small pebble into the stream. <br><br>  On the NTS OMZ server, I found pictures of this place at the right time, and was able to get the process in dynamics. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/a80/8fd/e60/a808fde6079207fb3c722753e3c36366.gif"><br>  <a href="http://allmars.net/photo-earth-orbit/item/237-prince">Larger size</a> <br><br>  This material seemed interesting <a href="http://lenta.ru/news/2013/03/29/electroripples/">Lenta.Ru</a> .  But I decided to talk about our shooting and abroad.  The animation was added to his NASA picture material by the popular American astro-space site <a href="http://www.universetoday.com/101086/weird-cloud-coils-captured-by-earth-observing-satellite/">Universe Today</a> .  From there it was reprinted by some <a href="http://www.ac24.cz/zpravy-ze-sveta/1933-zvlastni-civky-mraku-zachycene-satelitem-sledujici-zemi">Czech</a> news site.  There images provoked heated discussions.  I am not strong in Czech, but they seem to have found this ripple evidence of the use of HAARP climate weapons or something. <br><br>  Universe Today <a href="http://www.universetoday.com/102049/an-awesome-annular-eclipse-images-and-videos-from-earth-and-space/">published a</a> video of a solar eclipse on May 10, 2013 from Electro-L. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/folJf4d1riw%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700022,15700186,15700191,15700253,15700258&amp;usg=ALkJrhi_-ydkhnlnnXFaH6l_LqeBjf68FQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  Over the past six months, there were more reasons to look at Earth through the eyes of Electro-L: dust storms in Saudi Arabia and the Sahara, smoke from forest fires in Singapore, unusual clouds from NASA ... I just talk about those that I had time to do with gifs, press releases and newsletters.  If it was not the unknown Zelenyikot who came in contact with the media, but the press service of Roskosmos or Roshydromet, then the materials were published much more readily by the media.  People love beautiful pictures, and the press needs high-quality and relevant content.  And most importantly - these are positive examples of the work of the national space program.  Creating interesting, informative and beautiful materials, searching for informational reasons, spreading through the media and social networks is what the PR team of NASA does.  And I do not see a clear explanation why Roscosmos does not do this. <br><br>  For example, at the beginning of May I announced the campaign ‚Äú <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/178629/">Let</a> 's <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/178629/">make Roskosmos kinder</a> ‚Äù.  The Federal Space Agency made a small miracle - it agreed to the <a href="http://www.change.org/ru/%25D0%25BF%25D0%25B5%25D1%2582%25D0%25B8%25D1%2586%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B8/%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D1%2581%25D0%25BA%25D0%25BE%25D1%2581%25D0%25BC%25D0%25BE%25D1%2581-%25D1%2581%25D0%25BD%25D1%258F%25D1%2582%25D1%258C-%25D1%2581%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BB%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B5%25D1%2587%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B5-%25D0%25B7%25D0%25B0%25D1%2582%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B5-10-%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B0%25D1%258F-2013-%25D0%25B3%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B0-%25D1%2581-%25D0%25B2%25D1%258B%25D1%2581%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BA%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B9-%25D1%2587%25D0%25B0%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D0%25BE%25D1%2582%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B9">appeal of</a> ordinary Internet users, and changed the Electro-L mode of operation.  These days, the press service had to broadcast from each iron what kind of good fellow the entire Roscosmos and fellows were the staff who implemented the unscheduled operation of the apparatus, but she was engaged in a much more important and responsible business - she explained how the management of the <a href="http://ria.ru/science/20130507/936199900.html">chairs was changing</a> .  Excellent demonstration of the domestic practice of interaction with the public! <br><br>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/175827/">The successful discovery of Mars-3</a> on Mars, they also safely ignored, although they knew in advance about the event ... Hmm. <br>  NGO them.  S.A.  Lavochkin turned out to be more responsive: at our first request, an engineer who worked on the creation of Mars-3, Yuriy Romanenko, was invited to a press conference.  Everyone liked: both journalists and Yuri;  Only told about this 1.5 TV channel and several sites.  <a href="http://metaver.net/2013/a-ya-polechu-na-saturn/">Here</a> more. <br><br>  Yes, Roscosmos has its own <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/tvroscosmos/videos">TV</a> , but it deals almost exclusively with the launch of rocket launches and work on the ISS.  On the one hand, this is a necessary thing, because Russia is still the world leader in the frequency of space launches, and, together with the United States, Europe and Japan, is pulling a project as heavy as the International Space Station.  But on the other - it is monotonous.  Rocket assembly, removal, installation, launch.  The astronauts congratulated and conveyed greetings from orbit.  Missiles have only differences in the flags on board: American, Mexican, European ... Depending on whose device they send to space.  The astronauts - who send greetings. <br><br>  Is it interesting for you?  Maybe I'm the only one who considers it a routine?  Or is it also a matter of the presentation of the material?  Commander <a href="https://twitter.com/Cmdr_Hadfield">Chris Hadfield</a> for six months, following Twitter on subscribers is 166 times more than the <a href="https://twitter.com/federalspace/followers">entire Roscosmos</a> in two and a half years. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/KaOC9danxNo%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700022,15700186,15700191,15700253,15700258&amp;usg=ALkJrhjrfFtDpIUF6C5LdvxewVtaYprgwQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  And then, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DHQMe3_tklkQ">something goes wrong</a> , and the whole country rushes to the screens to see something new, beautiful and original from the native space agency.  The Internet is immediately divided into two unequal parts: the majority is noisy about polymer loss and cutting, and a minority is trying to defend itself: ‚Äúbut we are ahead of the entire planet for rocket launches, and soon in 2015/2024/2030 we‚Äôre collecting everything.‚Äù  And even more, even defenders of national honor, have nothing to say, because apart from the number of missiles and the beautiful promises from Roskosmos they know nothing. <br><br>  It has to be admitted: Russia has dropped behind NASA for decades by unmanned aerial vehicles, which is sad, but this is not a reason to be offended by Roscosmos, and with sighs recall the achievements of the USSR.  There are problems, and I am sure many in the industry understand them and try to solve them.  And we have the potential, we have the rocket and space industry, which confidently holds silver on the pedestal of space leaders, we have successfully operating devices that supply important, useful and beautiful information, although they are not as many as we would like.  Will Roscosmos talk about them? I don‚Äôt know. <br><br>  I will ... If possible. <br><br>  In conclusion, I would like to say: ‚ÄúYura, <a href="https://vk.com/wall8535_1183">all is not lost!</a>  " <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/8d7/074/952/8d707495271482188c779a7792cd0fbc.jpg"><br>  <a href="">1920x1080</a> <a href="">1920x1200</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/185796/">https://habr.com/ru/post/185796/</a></p>
