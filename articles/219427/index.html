Well, not so much a million, but 5-10 thousand for sure.  That is why I did not think in this direction and did not even consider such an opportunity - to create something moving and reacting to the outside world.  However, after this top of <a href="http://roboforum.ru/forum88/topic2214.html">roboforum.ru/forum88/topic2214.html,</a> my idea changed and I got an idea. <br><br>  Attention is a brief description of 6 budget platforms for the robot up to 2000 rubles.  <b>The assessment is subjective, I will be glad if habrovchane throw links and examples to other budget platforms and opportunities that I missed.</b>

      For all examples, links to Ebay are given, at the time of the article, I chose the cheapest offers.  Before you place an order - look at the seller's rating, read the reviews and make sure the shipping cost.  And then I had precedents. <br><br><h4>  Platform of toys for 300 rubles </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/44f/65f/cba/44f65fcbacb4d8a565763d3419b10b18.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>Pros:</b> Cheap.  The cheapest version of the wheeled platform that you can think of.  Made from everything that can ride on wheels and has a motor.  You need at least 2 motors to create a manageable platform. <br><br>  <b>Cons:</b> Structural fragility, plastic, the need to think over the basis for the control board, incomprehensible motors, unknown gearbox parameters, the lack of normal mounting for sensors. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  As an example, I cite the platform created a couple of days ago from a pair of phenolic tanks, just like in the article <a href="http://roboforum.ru/forum88/topic2214.html">roboforum.ru/forum88/topic2214.html</a> I want to note that even though I live in the city by the sea and the markets with the Chinese there is an ocean, but it took me a week to find a pair of phenolic tanks, 300 rubles per pair.  Most likely you will not find such a toy in your city.  The advantages of the platform are four-wheel drive, soft, high wheels - good grip.  Simple motor fasteners to gearboxes, multi-stage reduction gearbox.  After the platform is assembled, there are two speakers, sound chips that reproduce the sound, a pair of cases with compartments for 3 batteries - all this can be used both for the robot and in other projects.  Of the minuses, I note the poor quality of plastics, the fragility.  The load on the platform should be minimal, a couple of shields, batteries and everything.  Conclusions about this platform, read at the end. <br><br>  <a href="http://www.ebay.com/itm/201005665657">www.ebay.com/itm/201005665657</a> <br><br><h4>  Ready platform with Ebay for 430 rubles </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/4b9/39a/190/4b939a19012d1f74777af171bc4c1062.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>Pros:</b> High-quality wheelbase for the robot, a platform with mounts for sensors, control boards.  Good gears, beautiful appearance.  Low price for a ready platform.  Ready mounting gears, encoders, battery compartment. <br><br>  <b>Minuses:</b> Plastic gearbox, 2 driving wheels - worse permeability.  Three wheels - worse stability. <br><br>  Excellent platform for tests.  Two motors, All you need is already in the kit.  In my opinion - a great option for pampering.  Two wheels with gears cost 260 rubles, without mounts and a plastic base <a href="http://www.ebay.com/itm/200991684601">www.ebay.com/itm/200991684601</a> , so buying a wheel platform is a bargain. <br><br>  <a href="http://www.ebay.com/itm/New-Motor-Smart-Robot-Car-Chassis-Kit-Speed-Encoder-Battery-Box-For-Arduino-/400651024984">www.ebay.com/itm/New-Motor-Smart-Robot-Car-Chassis-Kit-Speed-Encoder-Battery-Box-For-Arduino-/400651024984</a> <br><br><h4>  Ready platform with Ebay for 640 rubles </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/19c/6a7/825/19c6a78251c429e97f33b05e0c059103.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>Pros:</b> Everything is the same as in the previous one, but already 4 wheels, which means greater stability. <br><br>  <b>Cons:</b> All the same as in the previous one, but more expensive. <br><br>  This is the same platform as the previous example, with an additional wheel, but one third more expensive.  Meaning to pay more? <br><br>  <a href="http://www.ebay.com/itm/New-2WD-V8-Smart-Car-Chassis-Robot-Model-Tracking-Coded-Disc-DIY-Hot-Sales-L-/380865410953">www.ebay.com/itm/New-2WD-V8-Smart-Car-Chassis-Robot-Model-Tracking-Coded-Disc-DIY-Hot-Sales-L-/380865410953</a> <br><br><h4>  Ready platform with Ebay for 830 rubles </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a69/23e/855/a6923e855a0d8d05e9f9b91c0d8c97c5.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>Pros:</b> Four-wheel drive, 4 motors, 4 gears, 4 encoders, a full set of fasteners and a battery compartment.  Mass of space between the upper and lower platform of acrylic. <br><br>  <b>Cons:</b> Plastic everywhere. <br><br>  Excellent platform for the robot, each motor is controlled separately, the factory workmanship, beautiful appearance.  In my opinion the best solution for a budget robot. <br><br>  <a href="http://www.ebay.com/itm/4WD-Suspension-Car-Chassis-Smart-Car-Shock-Absorption-3-9V-for-Robot-Car-Arduino-/281268879168">www.ebay.com/itm/4WD-Suspension-Car-Chassis-Smart-Car-Shock-Absorption-3-9V-for-Robot-Car-Arduino-/281268879168</a> <br><br><h4>  Ready platform with Ebay for 950 rubles </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a53/daf/258/a53daf258c58370584a98dc5fc3cb6b5.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>Pros:</b> Steel base, four-wheel drive, strong appearance, two motors.  Motors look better than previous versions.  Another scheme of transmission of torque to the wheels.  The platform provides a breadboard for soldering! <br><br>  <b>Cons:</b> Plastic gears <br><br>  Beautiful wheeled platform for the robot.  Looks reliable - metal base, good crpezh.  Two motors - less control circuit.  Like the previous version, I consider it the best option for translating the robot into life.  Of the benefits - a prototype board right on the robot - it‚Äôs convenient!  It seems that the developers were not Chinese. <br><br>  <a href="http://www.ebay.com/itm/4-wheel-Mobile-Platform-small-Robot-Chassis-arduino-/270671106387">www.ebay.com/itm/4-wheel-Mobile-Platform-small-Robot-Chassis-arduino-/270671106387</a> <br><br><h4>  Ready platform with Ebay for 1900 rubles </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/413/e72/773/413e72773a8278df84aa06ec38e95645.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>Pros:</b> Metal construction, reinforced gearboxes, four-wheel drive, load up to 2 kg. <br>  <b>Cons:</b> Lack of encoders, battery compartment <br><br>  Cargo wheel platform)) Gears of another shape, most likely a larger slide, all-steel box-shaped base.  must withstand a relatively large weight.  However, twice as expensive as the previous model. <br><br>  <a href="http://www.ebay.com/itm/4-wheel-robot-chassis-2kg-Load-Arduino-mobile-platform-DC-motor-drive-car-/281199561074">www.ebay.com/itm/4-wheel-robot-chassis-2kg-Load-Arduino-mobile-platform-DC-motor-drive-car-/281199561074</a> <br><br>  Small conclusions.  Homemade toy platform - great.  But for more than a game and create a prototype of such a platform is not suitable.  As a result of creating such an improvised wheelbase, I can say that I would now buy a four-wheel-drive model number 4 or 5. This is a more durable design and has more potential.  But when the amount of equipment hung begins to bend my platform - then buy the option number 6 already. <br><br>  PS There are a lot of more expensive platforms, completely metal, with metal gears in the gearboxes, but they are far from the budget. <br><br>  If you know more options for budget platforms - please comment in the comments. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/219427/">https://habr.com/ru/post/219427/</a></p>
