According to the developers (the Tagline expert group), he describes the general situation, key events, business leaders, personnel aspects for 2009 in the market of customized development of Internet projects in Russia, and also describes trends in the development of the industry in the coming years. <br><br>  You can read this information at: <br>  <a href="http://2009.tagline.ru/news/digest2009.html">http://2009.tagline.ru/news/digest2009.html</a> <br><br>  In this article I want to express my <b>personal</b> opinion on this digest. <br>  I want to say that the purpose of "what to find fault" was not worth it! <br>  Moreover, immediately after reading this document, I made a vow and could not comment on it anywhere, because: <br><ol><li>  I am very afraid that all this will grow into what is happening now on the habr: <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/webdev/83885/">http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/webdev/83885/</a> </li><li>  criticizing is much easier than doing. </li></ol> But ‚Äúhaving slept‚Äù with this idea, I realized that I still want to express my thoughts.  What I am doing here. <br>  Why did I decide that?  Because I hate behind-the-scenes games and I want to say everything that I think is open! <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  So:

      <b>1. General market situation</b> <br><br> <code>"   2009,   ¬´¬ª     2008  (,    2008     6,8 . .).     4 000  (   ‚Äî  ),    -  "</code> <br> <br>  Where does this information come from?  Please note that I am not carping.  As a market participant, this information is really very interesting to me.  I want to use it in my work and base my plans on its basis.  In order for me to do this, I must understand for myself how accurate this information is.  And so that I understand this, I would like to see the sources ... <br><br>  Whether this information is a ‚Äúestimate‚Äù of the creators of the digest or is this real statistical information not entirely clear.  If this is the second, then what was the sample?  Who participated in it?  What was the methodology? <br><br> <code>"    2009              ,           .       ,               ."</code> <br> <br>  You say "key events" in the industry, but in reality, only one association belongs to the key event.  But more about that further ... <br><br>  <b>2. Key events in the market for 2009</b> <br><br> <code>"    ()&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;   ,      ,     , 25  2009.        ¬´  ¬ª    ."</code> <br> <br>  In 2009, 2 associations appeared in Russia: <br><ol><li>  AIR (Association of Internet Developers) <br>  and </li><li>  AIA (Association of Interactive Agencies) </li></ol>  At the same time, one of them suddenly became the ‚Äúmost important event of the whole year,‚Äù and the second one got into the ‚Äúother events‚Äù.  Type "Welcome dear friend Carloson, well, you come ...". <br>  At the same time, one of them is closed with a ban on participation in other organizations, and the second is an open organization with a minimum of bans. <br>  At the same time, one organization is the official partner of the Tagline expert group, and the second is not. <br>  It seems to me the situation is a bit poveryvaet!  Or am I not pgav?  ;) <br><br>  Let us consider the comments of the developers of the rating in this situation: <br><br>  <i>"In associations, it‚Äôs not the number that matters, but the composition of the participants."</i>  - says Andrei Terekhov. <br>  ‚Äú <i>We wrote about AIR. Nevertheless, the AIA does unite larger companies, they are more noticeable, and the Association is more noticeable‚Äù</i> - these are already the words of Alexey Ramensky. <br><br>  Which organization will be "more visible"?  An organization that brings together several major market players, or an organization that brings together many ordinary players in this market?  Large and small, from the capital and regions ... <br>  Yes, in general, what does "more noticeable" mean?  Is it about PR or about the real tasks of the association and their implementation? <br>  AIR, at the moment, is much more active.  Seminars are already held for clients (constantly), new participants are opened and receiving, committees are formed on the main areas of activity for which active work is being done. <br><br>  My personal opinion, the AIA lost a little in time, and what we have in this case is a rather ugly attempt to catch up. <br>  And how well it all began ... We were told that we are digital agencies, you are web studios!  We are different types of businesses, what do we share? <br>  But, if you think about it, the tasks of the AIA and the AIR are essentially the same.  Teach customers, share experiences, make the market more stable and more transparent.  Too bad what happens the way it turns out.  :( <br><br>  Yes!  I almost forgot about another very interesting nuance!  :) <br>  ALL links from the digest lead to the relevant sites, but the link to the AIR leads to the same dodget!  Gentlemen, you did not find the website of AIR in the network? <br>  I will tell you: <a href="http://yandex.ru/yandsearch%3Ftext%3D%25D0%25B0%25D1%2581%25D1%2581%25D0%25BE%25D1%2586%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B0%25D1%2586%25D0%25B8%25D1%258F%2B%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BD%25D1%2582%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B5%25D1%2582%2B%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B7%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B1%25D0%25BE%25D1%2582%25D1%2587%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BA%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2%26amp%3Blr%3D213">http://yandex.ru/yandsearch?text=association + Internet + developers</a> <br><br>  Go ahead? <br><br>  And then we have a wonderful picture: <br><br><br><img alt="Association of Interactive Agencies (AIA)" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/7a2/aaa/509/7a2aaa509e8cab831395093cf2effb41.jpg"><br><br>  <strong>I am interested in the following question:</strong> <br>  Do companies know 1, 5, 8, 9, 11, etc.  what is aaa? <br>  Or are they not made up and this is just a picture for example, and the real participants are indicated by arrows? <br>  Strange!  And I got the complete idea that they are all members of the AIA.  Psychology however! <br><br>  Further... <br><br>  Over the past year, really a huge number of different events took place.  I want to know by what principle were presented presented in the digest? <br>  No, the events are really interesting and worthwhile, but why only them? <br>  Where is PHPConf, WebHiTech, Optimization 2009?  Yes, the same Runet Prize? <br><br>  All of course can be attributed to the keyword "digest" ( <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2594%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B9%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B6%25D0%25B5%25D1%2581%25D1%2582">http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digest</a> ), but in my opinion, if you do something, you should do it seriously and thoroughly.  Or do not do it at all. <br><br>  <b>Finally:</b> YES, I am one of the participants of the AIR, but this is my personal position and my personal thoughts. <br><br><br></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/84042/">https://habr.com/ru/post/84042/</a></p>
