For the new year, scientists, engineers, businessmen, and all who feel like it, are trying to predict the future.  Is blockchain a serious technology, or another buzzword?  Will bots kill mobile apps in 2017?  Will this year's immersion in virtual reality cease to cause seasickness? <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/866/ed7/0e6/866ed70e6d5617f3ca2c648157622177.jpg"><br>  <i><font color="#999999">Telegraph kills live chat</font></i> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Technologies are insidious, there is plenty of historical evidence.  The forecasts made by the most educated people of their time, who had the most up-to-date, most up-to-date information, now often look simply terrifyingly inaccurate. <br><br>  Especially vividly, even through the darkness of centuries, predictions shine, which demonstrate noticeable but incorrect judgments, misunderstandings of questions, overly optimistic exaggerations, self-deception, and the good old flaw that anyone just doesn‚Äôt betray - wishful thinking.

      Below, I have given the most incorrect predictions that show that even the giants of business and science do not always know what they are talking about.  Here there are also judgments about technological progress, and about the possible perception by society of those or other inventions, and about the market potential of various ideas and developments.  Now everyone understands how ‚Äúpast the target‚Äù these forecasts passed.  But then - then these were words that had weight.  That must be why we still remember them. <br><br><h4>  <font color="#3AC1EF">1876</font> </h4><br>  ‚Äú <i>This‚Äú phone ‚Äùhas too many shortcomings to seriously consider it a means of communication.</i>  " <br>  - William Orton, President of Western Union <br><br>  ‚Äú <i>Americans need a phone, but we don‚Äôt.</i>  <i>We have enough messengers.</i>  " <br>  - Sir William Price, Chief Postman of England <br><br><h4>  <font color="#3AC1EF">1889</font> </h4><br>  ‚ÄúTo <i>mess with alternating current is a waste of time.</i>  <i>No one will ever use it.</i>  " <br>  - Thomas Edison <br><br><h4>  <font color="#3AC1EF">1903</font> </h4><br>  ‚ÄúThe <i>horse was, is and will be, but the car - only a new fleeting whim.</i>  " <br>  - The president of the Michigan Savings Bank advises Henry Ford‚Äôs lawyer, Horace Rackam, not to invest in the Ford Motor Company. <br><br><h4>  <font color="#3AC1EF">1921</font> </h4><br>  ‚Äú <i>The music box without wires has no commercial value.</i>  <i>Who will pay to send a message that is not intended to a specific recipient?</i>  " <br>  - Partners David Sarnoff, responding to his request for investment in radio. <br><br><h4>  <font color="#3AC1EF">1926</font> </h4><br>  ‚Äú <i>While from a theoretical and technical point of view, television looks realistic, I do not believe in its commercial and financial success.</i>  " <br>  - Lee de Forest, ‚ÄúFather of Radio‚Äù, a pioneer in the field of sound recording of films with sound recording on film, with more than 180 patents. <br><br><h4>  <font color="#3AC1EF">1932</font> </h4><br>  ‚Äú <i>There is not the slightest reason to assume that nuclear energy can ever be obtained.</i>  <i>This would mean that man learned to destroy atoms.</i>  " <br>  - Albert Einstein <br><br><h4>  <font color="#3AC1EF">1936</font> </h4><br>  ‚ÄúA <i>rocket can never leave the Earth‚Äôs atmosphere.‚Äù</i>  " <br>  - "New York Times" <br><br><h4>  <font color="#3AC1EF">1946</font> </h4><br>  ‚Äú <i>Television, after the appearance, will not be able to stay in any market for more than six months.</i>  <i>People just get tired of looking into the plywood box every evening.</i>  " <br>  - Darryl Zanuk, producer, one of the founders of 20th Century Fox. <br><br><h4>  <font color="#3AC1EF">1949</font> </h4><br>  ‚Äú <i>ENIAC includes 18,000 vacuum tubes and all 30 tons.</i>  <i>Computers of the future may well have only 1000 lamps and weigh a ton and a half.</i>  " <br>  - "Popular Mechanics" <br><br><h4>  <font color="#3AC1EF">1957</font> </h4><br>  ‚Äú <i>I traveled this country along and across, communicated with outstanding people, and I can absolutely unequivocally say that data processing is just a fad, the interest in which will not last even a year.</i>  " <br>  - Editor of the business literature of the publishing house Prentice Hall <br><br><h4>  <font color="#3AC1EF">1959</font> </h4><br>  ‚ÄúThe <i>probable volume of the world market of copying machines is no more than 5000 pieces.</i>  " <br>  - IBM's answer to the founders of Xerox <br><br><h4>  <font color="#3AC1EF">1961</font> </h4><br>  ‚Äú <i>There is practically no chance of using communication satellites to provide better telephone and telegraph communications, to improve the transmission of a television or radio signal in the United States.</i>  " <br>  - T.

Dewell, Special Representative of the US Patent Office (1899) <br><br><h3>  <font color="#3AC1EF">Conclusions: do not confuse trends with facts</font> </h3><br>  This is what Paul Krugman, the Nobel Prize winner in economics of 2008, noted in his 1998 article, brilliantly titled: "Why the predictions of most economists do not come true." <br><br>  ‚ÄúThe speed of the spread of the Internet will fall sharply, contrary to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metcalfe%2527s_law">law of Metcalf</a> , who claims that the number of possible connections on the Web is proportional to the square of the number of its participants.  After all, it becomes obvious that most people simply have nothing to say to each other!  By about 2005, it will be clear that the Internet has no more impact on the economy than fax. ‚Äù <br><br>  This is my favorite prediction, because as a result Krugman denied himself. <br>  Making predictions is risky.  Especially - if they are about the near future.  As soon as it turns out that the prediction is wrong, the words, like a boomerang, return to the one who said them, and they are snapped up for quotes that always persecute their author. <br><br>  And what unfulfilled predictions seem to be the most interesting to you? </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/322138/">https://habr.com/ru/post/322138/</a></p>
