  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Texts for online stores</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  I buy almost everything in Internet shops, with the exception of large-scale equipment and products.  And I always read store texts.  True, solely out of professional interest.  But after a recent attempt to find and buy a solar battery for a laptop in online stores of Runet, professional interest turned into an insistent desire to express their thoughts about the texts on the pages of most online stores.  And from the point of view of the buyer.  And from the point of view of the Internet Client copywriter, who writes these texts every day. <br><br><h5>  Give me what I want! </h5><br>  In the online store, the user most often comes to a specific landing page.  For example, at the request ‚Äúbuy a gasoline saw‚Äù, a visitor will most likely get into the catalog of gasoline saws.  A wonderful commercial inquiry, according to which the client comes to the site already ‚Äúhot‚Äù, ready to buy, isn't it?  And he just needs to poke his nose in the very saw he needs for the house or the dacha.  And what does the poor guy see in the text? <a name="habracut"></a><br><br><blockquote>  <i>In the home, cottage, farm petrol saw is an indispensable tool.</i>  <i>The compact, mobile saw is useful both on picnic, and in a campaign.</i>  <i>Buy a gasoline saw is needed in the event that the scope of your interests ...</i> </blockquote>
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>
        <script>
          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      Why convince a person of the need to purchase, if he is already ready to buy?  He is already moving money on the card, and they are trying to tell him "what a saw is and what a useful thing it is." <br><br>  The main purpose of the text on the product page, product catalog or section in the online store is to help with the selection.  The text on the product page should tell about the technical characteristics and merits of this particular product.  The text on the product catalog page of the manufacturer - about the series and product lines of this brand, their features, purpose, etc.  The text on the pages of the ‚Äúgrinder‚Äù category, for example, is intended to describe the criteria for choosing electrical and mechanical grinders, the dependence of model functionality on price, etc. For me, the best example of literate, useful and correct texts for an online store is the store vseinstrumenti.ru. <br><br><h5>  Sheets and stubs </h5><br>  Coming to the pages of a virtual store, I cannot touch, try on, listen to the rustle of cloth or feel the fragrance of perfumes.  Therefore, it is important to compensate for the lack of visual information, tactile and olfactory impressions with good quality graphics, ‚Äújuicy‚Äù descriptions of goods and an indication of their exact characteristics.  But for some reason, most often in the description of the goods, the store is limited to a stubby stub in the form of an extract from the technical specification, but in the product catalog it is broken by unreadable long text.  Even without being an SEO specialist, I know that the promotion of "sheets" is no longer relevant.  So if not for Yandex, then for whom then these sheets of unstructured text are written for 3000-5000 characters? <br><br>  Yes, it happens that there is a lot of useful information and it is important to convey it to the buyer.  In this case, it is convenient to place an introductory part in one or two sentences above the product catalog, in which we inform the customer that he has come to the address and we really have what he is looking for. <br><br><blockquote>  <i>In the section ‚ÄúHooks and knitting needles‚Äù there is a whole size range of accessories for knitting (from 2 to 10) Vita, Addi, PONY, GAMMA, PRYM.</i>  <i>Your choice of straight and circular needles, steel, bone and wooden hooks.</i> </blockquote><br><br>  The second, more voluminous, fragment of text can be placed at the bottom of the page, giving it specific recommendations for choosing and buying. <br><br><blockquote>  <i>Bone, plastic and steel knitting needles are the best choice for light yarn.</i>  <i>Aluminum knitting needles, although convenient, but in the process of knitting slightly dye wool, so they can be used only to work with yarn of dark colors.</i>  <i>As for the length, then ...</i> </blockquote><br><br>  With the successful placement of goods and good photos, the principle of ‚Äúcome, see, buy‚Äù works.  So the buyer may not get to the bottom of the text.  But for search engines and meticulous clients, our optimizers still need to structure a large text, breaking it down not only with subtitles, but also with lists, graphic elements, tables. <br><br><h5>  the main </h5><br>  If your visitor didn‚Äôt get to the product or section page, but to the main page, what would he see? <br><br><blockquote>  <i>The team of the online store "Christmas tree winder" is glad to welcome you!</i>  <i>We work in the capital market of Christmas trees for more than 10 years and every year the number of our customers grows satisfied customers ...</i> </blockquote><br><br>  This is followed by 10,000 text listing "our advantages" ... <br><br>  I do not want to read.  I'm not interested in reading in the store.  I read in the library or on the couch.  In the store I buy! <br>  And coming to the store, I want to see right away and here is what I need.  I will not see here and now the product I need or the menu with categories and subcategories in large print or large buttons, I will look further!  And all the more I am not interested in YOUR advantages.  I am interested in mine, and only mine! <br><br>  Remove the text from the main sheet or at least slide it down!  Hang up a photo gallery of goods, a carousel of new products, display the section menu in large print for each category.  Do something, but do not force the visitor to wade through the wilds of letters in search of the right product. <br><br>  And yes ... I am not an egoist and not fussy.  The most classic buyer of clothes, shoes, books, electronics and home appliances in online stores Runet.  The buyer, who wander the net thousands ... </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/187038/">https://habr.com/ru/post/187038/</a></p>
