That the Earth is flat, that Nero and Napoleon are one person, that not only the Americans did not fly to the Moon, but no one ever flew anywhere, and even that Antarctica does not exist.  And more and more often I have to answer the question: is it true that at the turn of the 18th and 19th centuries there was a nuclear war and there were such wars before - archaeologists regularly find signs of ancient nuclear catastrophes, but it is not customary to talk about it? <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  And before answering this question, let us see what signs of a developed military conflict with the widespread use of nuclear weapons will persist after three hundred and three thousand years.

    <h3>  Radiation </h3><br>  This is what first comes to mind.  And ‚Äústrongly radioactive remains of people and animals‚Äù is a favorite argument of supporters of this hypothesis.  Indeed, the ancient bones are often noticeable, and sometimes quite radioactive.  Could this radioactivity be associated with a nuclear catastrophe?  No, and that's why. <br><br>  First, it is enough to bring these bones to a gamma spectrometer (or vice versa, bring a gamma spectrometer to them) to see that this radioactivity is due to the daughter products of uranium-238 and thorium-232. <br><br>  Secondly - as is known, the level of radiation after the explosion decreases quite quickly.  As a result of the fission reaction, many different fission products are formed, the number of which within certain mass ranges of the nucleus (86-100 and 134-145) is approximately the same - a few percent for each isotope.  Among them are those that break up right there, that they live seconds, minutes, hours ... There are those whose half-life is measured in years and decades.  There are thousands and millions of years and even stable.  But stable isotopes are a narrow strip on the NZ diagram, therefore their output is insignificant.  And the farther from it - the isotope decays faster - and therefore, it shouts louder about itself with its beta and gamma radiation.  But he quickly "cool."  It can be said that at each instant of time the integral radioactivity of the explosion products is determined by the shortest of the nuclides remaining in them. <br><br>  Over a period of time comparable to human life, such basic dose-forming nuclides are cesium-137 and strontium-90, which have a half-life of about 30 years (28.9 years for strontium-90 and 30.16 years for cesium-137) .  They are the ones who currently give ‚Äúdosimeter readings‚Äù on the streets, for example, Pripyat. <br><br>  And in three hundred years their number will decrease a thousand times.  And that famous Chernobyl bucket, in which reckless visitors of the ChZO are so fond of being photographed, will almost no longer ‚Äúfade‚Äù with them.  Other isotopes will come to the fore, but the overall level of radioactivity will drop hundreds of times.  And it will become so low that it will be difficult to detect it with the help of a radiometer examination. <br><br>  And the radioactivity of bones, which from thousands to tens of millions of years, is certainly not associated with nuclear explosions. <br><br>  Does this mean that an atomic explosion that occurred 300, 1000, 10,000 years ago would not have left any detectable radioactive traces at the moment?  No, it does not mean.  Short-lived isotopes would have decayed, but long-lived ones would remain. <br><br>  Firstly, these are transuranic elements.  The half-life of the main isotopes of neptunium, plutonium, americium makes it possible to detect these nuclides even hundreds of thousands of years.  Their ‚Äúbackground‚Äù content, due to the activation of uranium by spontaneous fission neutrons and cosmic rays, is negligible, so that they will reliably label the fission chain reaction. <br>  There are long-lived nuclides among the fission products.  It is difficult to see them in relatively fresh ones, because their initial amount is the same as in all the others, but because of the longer half-life, their activity is much lower.  And after the decay of strontium-90 and cesium-137, they will be perfectly visible. <br><br>  By the way, radioactive isotopes are wonderful ‚Äúclocks‚Äù, and by their correlation it is usually possible to determine whether their origin is older or they were introduced due to modern contamination of the sample. <br><br>  So a nuclear explosion in the past would leave a radioactive trace, which, if searched, would definitely be discovered. <br><br>  But maybe they didn‚Äôt search, it didn‚Äôt occur to you? <br><br>  No, they were looking for - but with other goals.  When samples are collected that are accumulated in a stratigraphic sequence of sediments (for example, silt on the bottom of lakes or seas) and study the contents of radionuclides in them in layers, two characteristic peaks are always found.  One - deeper and more - is nuclear testing in the 60s-70s.  Another - smaller and closer to the surface - Chernobyl.  And from some depth radionuclides disappear completely.  Or they do not disappear - but the culprits of this are not atomic bombardments, but ordinary bottom inhabitants, for example, polychaetes.  They shovel the top layer of silt, dig holes in it and bring surface material to a depth.  And then we find cesium-137 and plutonium at a depth corresponding to two hundred years.  Moreover, their correlation is typical for the present - and if the sample was really 200 years old, then cesium would be much less. <br><br>  The same applies to the annual rings of trees.  Reached the end of the forties - everything, then no trace of fission products and transuranic elements. <br><br><h3>  Glass melting </h3><br>  Another characteristic trace of a nuclear explosion is the melting products of what meteorites are called "target rocks".  When nuclear weapons are used against people, not only earth and stone, but also brick, concrete, metal, the bones of people and animals become ‚Äútarget rocks‚Äù.  In the heat of a nuclear explosion, they form a melt rich in silicon oxide, which then solidifies into glass. <br><br>  These should be the craters from nuclear explosions, and not those for which usually supporters of the ‚Äúnuclear war of 1812‚Äù give out karst failures.  Where are these funnels with melting glass plates?  They are not. <br><br>  And here we remember (read the voice of the radio announcer "Star"): <br><blockquote>  Scattered pieces of caked clay and green glass come across among the ruins <br>  (whole layers!).  In all likelihood, sand and clay under the influence of high temperature first melted and then instantly hardened.  The same layers of green glass <br>  appear in the desert of Nevada (USA) every time after a nuclear explosion.  Analysis <br>  samples held at the University of Rome and in the laboratory of the National Council <br>  Italy's research showed: the melting occurred at a temperature of 1400-1500 degrees.  Such a temperature at that time could have been obtained in the horn of a metallurgical workshop, but by no means in a vast open area. </blockquote>  This is about Mohenjo-Daro.  Is there really an atomic catastrophe? <br><br>  We collect data further and find: <br><blockquote> Another mystery for researchers is a very high level of radiation in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe explosion.  As early as 1927, archaeologists found 27 fully preserved human skeletons.  Even now, the level of their radiation background is close to the radiation dose received by the residents of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. </blockquote>  And here it becomes clear: this radioactivity is certainly not of ‚Äúnuclear‚Äù origin.  Why - see the previous section. <br><br>  In fact, Stanislav Yermakov perfectly described everything about Mohenjo-Daro in his article <a href="http://aenforum.org/index.php%3Fapp%3Dcore%26module%3Dattach%26section%3Dattach%26attach_id%3D1937">[S. E. Yermakov. "Nuclear Nightmare" Mohenjo-Daro // Anomaly 2013. ‚Ññ2.</a>  <a href="http://aenforum.org/index.php%3Fapp%3Dcore%26module%3Dattach%26section%3Dattach%26attach_id%3D1937">Pp. 3-16]</a> , to which I refer the reader.  The only thing is that the author mentions the measurements of the radiation background at the excavations, but they only reveal the lies of the myth-makers about the supposedly terrifying radiation at this place.  And in order to identify or disprove the fact of a nuclear explosion at this place they are useless. In fact, of course, it was necessary to investigate the very melted glassy crusts found there for transuranic elements. <br><br><h3>  Radiocarbon anomaly </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ux/eg/5x/uxeg5xyipahmfyqdz5gm6quvzk4.png"><br><br>  A well-known picture illustrating the so-called ‚Äúbomb effect‚Äù is the result of irradiating the atmosphere with neutrons from numerous nuclear explosions, in which stable nitrogen-14 is converted into radioactive carbon-14.  The one that historians use to determine the age of their finds.  The massive use of nuclear weapons in the past would have led to a similar ‚Äúbomb effect‚Äù in the past.  And this effect would not go unnoticed. <br>  The fact is that the radiocarbon dating method would not be so accurate without its calibration.  One such calibration method is dendrochronological.  Trees are known to grow in annual rings, and counting them is a sure way to determine their lifespan.  Moreover, changes in the conditions under which the tree grew are recorded in the sequence of annual rings.  And you can continue the ‚Äúchronicle‚Äù of one tree by another, more ancient, if at some time period these two trees grew in parallel: the sequence of wide and narrow annual rings during this period will be very similar for these two trees.  So you can get a lot of wood samples, whose age is known with an accuracy of one year for several thousand years!  And by the deviations of the radiocarbon content with increasing age from the theoretical exponent of carbon-14 decay associated with changes in the intensity of cosmic radiation, the errors of the radiocarbon method can be corrected.  Therefore, the "bomb effect" would not pass by scientists: it would be visible on this curve in the form of a well-marked jump. <br><br>  And what is most interesting, there are such jumps, and there are even two of them: in 774 and 992 (other, weaker ones were found), they are called ‚ÄúMiyake events‚Äù.  True, they are much (several orders of magnitude) weaker than the jump of the middle of the 20th century, but their peculiarity - they are observed in wood samples all over the globe - and, moreover, is synchronous.  And they coincide with the beryllium-10 and chlorine-36 jumps - other cosmogenic radionuclides formed in the upper atmosphere under the action of cosmic radiation - in the ice of Greenland and Antarctica. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/06/pk/3y/06pk3yq-bwx5x8msk_amxw4c8jo.jpeg"><br><br>  But it is unlikely they are associated with something artificial.  Scientists attribute them to powerful solar flares, similar to the Carrington event of 1859, but even more ambitious.  But even an explosion of a Hiroshima-type atomic bomb would have given a much larger radiocarbon anomaly. <br><br><h3>  * * * </h3><br>  There is no reason to believe that, until the middle of the 20th century, there were generally nuclear weapons on Earth.  There are no signs of its use.  You can, of course, say ‚Äúyou are all lying‚Äù, which was not found because you didn‚Äôt search, and if you did, you found and classified it ... But you can think of it and prove ‚Äôanything you want.  Which, however, is being done by such lovers of world conspiracies. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/446306/">https://habr.com/ru/post/446306/</a></p>
