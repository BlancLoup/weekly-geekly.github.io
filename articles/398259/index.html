Probably everyone knows this game.  And the majority of fans of the post-apocalyptic adventure series of Asylum dwellers are familiar not only with 3D games, but also with the first isometric options.  Now fans of the ‚Äútube‚Äù Fallout can be happy: you can play a mod for Fallout 2, which is called ‚ÄúFallout 1.5: Resurrection‚Äù. <br><br>  Those who are familiar with this mod, argue that "this is the Fallout 3, what it was supposed to be."  It all starts in a character waking up in a dirty ditch.  The main character remembers little, and around - many mutants.  In order to get out of here, you first need to defeat a couple of radscoprions.  This immediately reminds the player that he is in the environment of the good old Fallout, and not his modern incarnations. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Created mod developers from the Czech Republic.  They spent on development ten years and on translation two and a half more years.  So much time was spent not only because the mod is really extensive, but also because the team did not devote all its time to development.  Interestingly, the mod was released in Czech language back in 2013, so it cannot be called new.  In any case, the mod is a unique game world, developed, if not entirely from scratch, then close to that.

Here are some interesting facts about fashion: <br><br><ul><li>  The plot covers the territory of New Mexico.  Fallout 1.5 is so named because events take place between the first and second parts, and there is a reference to the NKR; </li><li>  There are not so many cities - about as many as there were in the first part.  True, there are a lot of tasks, the number of ways to perform tasks has been increased; </li><li>  Running currency is still cap.  No car (unfortunately), no Brotherhood of Steel.  There are several high-tech facilities. </li></ul><br>  In addition to the storyline and characters, there are several new features.  For example, these are graphics in hi-res, saving in any quantity and the ability to work with the mouse wheel.  These updates do not cause a feeling of alienity, the developers simply tried to smooth out some not very successful moments of the first versions. <br><br>  But the old interface and the initial dungeon immediately give the player a sense of immersion in the "same" Fallout.  The storyline is also traditional.  The mod itself is a mixture of scenes and characters of Fallout 1 and 2, with new quests, settlements and a large number of new characters.  The creators of the mod say that the plot here is non-linear, and you can perform various tasks very differently.  Search for secret objects will have on their own - no automatic marks on the map, nothing like that. <br><br>  In the process of passing the player will always feel the hostility of the environment - to help few people want, but take away the life of the character along with a couple of things - it is always welcome.  Passing the game can also be different - either kill everyone, or try to convince.  It all depends on the desire of the player and the characteristics of the character.  When resolving various issues, you will be faced with a large number of ethical dilemmas.  There is no perfect solution, you have to choose the best solution from several worst ones. <br><br>  The developers claim that the game is a ‚ÄúFallout for Fallout fans‚Äù, so beginners may not find the mod as attractive as those gamers who have long been familiar with this world and its characters.  Mod gives a few complications.  So, if in Fallout 2 you could wander around the map (or even go through the whole game in 15 minutes), here in remote regions a character will quickly come across a crowd of ghouls armed with hi-tech weapons.  They will destroy Chosen before he reaches the edge of the screen, trying to escape. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/af9/16d/c33/af916dc33559ffde45ad19c8eaaad3b7.jpg"><br><br>  According to the developers, the storyline is designed for 25 hours of passage.  The gameplay allows you not only to enjoy the world of the game, but also to understand its dark side, to get acquainted with the other side of the coin.  Playing in "Fallout 1.5: Resurrection" you can forget that this is a mod.  In fact, this is practically a new game, with the graphics and gameplay that is necessary according to the ideas of many old school players. <br><br>  There are more than 80 sections of the map where you can do something and 736 scripts.  As mentioned above, the plot is very extensive.  If you do not hurry with the passage, you can spend more than 25 hours on the game. <br><br>  You can download the mod <a href="http://resurrection.cz/en/download/">from here</a> .  In addition to this mod, you can try to play in the Russian <a href="http://fallout-nevada.ucoz.ru/">Fallout: Nevada</a> .  On the web you can find a large number of excellent reviews.  The current mode of the players are also mainly positive.  The mod is absolutely free - it was made by fans for fans, so there is no question of money. <br><br>  The first part of Fallout <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallout">was released</a> in 1997.  It was released by Interplay Entertainment, or rather, its division Black Isle Studios.  In this part, the first main task of the Asylum resident was to find a water chip to replace the old one that had gone bad.  Without it, the inhabitants of the Vault would simply not have survived.  The main feature of the gameplay is that in the game world the player has complete freedom of action - he can travel, chat, fight, complete tasks (main and side), and receive the necessary information. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/398259/">https://habr.com/ru/post/398259/</a></p>
