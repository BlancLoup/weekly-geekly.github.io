I have solar on the roof. </blockquote><blockquote>  I have solar and I never had to pay for electricity.  Gas for my hybrid was about double that. </blockquote><blockquote>  Insurance so far </blockquote><blockquote>  Check it out.  Mine offers $ 450, so I purchased the Tesla wall connector for $ 500.

Lol </blockquote><blockquote>  One super charge cost me 6.58 which was something like .23 per kwh.  It is estimated that at 12  I am operating at under 1/3 of that cost. </blockquote><blockquote>  I used to drive a diesel van daily before Tesla.  And that had fuel cost of around 700 dollars per month.  The electricity costs under 10 cents per kWh here.  A paid charging station at workplace costs 0.15 eur / kWh.  And for the model of the supercharging is free (as I got it with the referral code on time).  Driving around is very very cheap.  I am saving at least 600 dollars per month in fuel alone.  This is good because it is circa 1500 eur (aka 1800 dollars) per month.  The fuel savings make it a lot more reasonable number.  Better to pay for Tesla than oil company. </blockquote><blockquote>  'm super lucky.  I charge at work for free. </blockquote><blockquote>  Approx $ 1,000.  20,000 miles.

For electric car $ 0.045.  This includes service and fuel prices.  Tires, oil change, etc. <br><br>  My electricity bills have decreased.  I concluded that the fact that I charge at home does not play a big role.  Last week I was charged at the recreation center in general for free. <br><br>  Spoken Model S since October 2014.  I spend $ 25 a month for electricity plus two sets of rubber - winter, I bought last week and summer, which I bought this summer. <br><br>  $ 120 for electricity in 2 months ... <br><br>  Free - I have solar panels at home! <br>  <i>He further specifies that the solar panels have almost paid for themselves.</i> <br><br>  Few. <br><br>  During the 8 months that I have an electric car, I spent $ 104 on charging (7.240 km passed). <br><br>  Costs - only the cost of the car and insurance.  For everything else, $ 0.  I have a Model S and Model 3 and a total mileage of 64.370 km. <br><br>  Electricity bills increased more than I expected.  I thought I could save 75%, but in fact only 50% came out.  But I drive an average of 240 km a day and have already rolled 10,000 km in the 5 weeks I have owned the car. <br><br>  I spent only $ 5 on the Supercharger when I just bought the car in May.  After that, he charged only at home and did not notice the difference in electricity bills.  Extremely pleased with what a big difference between an electric car and a gasoline car. <br><br>  Our electricity bills are more dependent on whether the daughter has forgotten to turn off the lights or not.  Tesla does not affect them. <br><br>  Almost nothing, since the schedule of my wife allows us to charge for free at work! <br><br>  We have Model S and Model X. Both charge for free charging near work. <br><br>  Free charging near work and free Supercharger.  Total spent $ 0.  In a couple of months, it will be necessary to change the tires to ‚Äúall season‚Äù. <br><br>  I also have.  Free charging at work.  Already traveled 8,000 km.  Probably spent about $ 50 on different charges.  It seems to me that rubber eats quickly, but did not specifically measure it. <br><br>  Somehow on the road broke the wheel.  Gained a great free service Tesla road service (support on the road). <br><br>  I go "from the garage to the garage."  Still left the factory protective coating <i>(I do not know how best to translate into Russian wax - that is, what is rubbing the car)</i> .  My car myself.  Therefore, you can add a couple of dollars to a couple of liters of detergent for the car. <br><br>  Another insurance on the car and the interest on the loan, which is very much for me, since the Model 3 is 2 times more expensive than the most expensive car that I had before (but also much faster). <br><br>  Electricity bills increased by $ 30 per month.  If you add more and charging on Supercharger and other stations, then we got $ 39.  Spoken car just 1 month.  And yes.  Another $ 140 for rubber mats and $ 75 for other accessories. <br><br>  About 30 dollars on the Supercharger.  We have solar panels at home, so we don‚Äôt pay for electricity.  Total drove until 21,000 km. <br><br>  $ 9.49 (and that, just because I wanted to try the Supercharger).  Free charging near work and solar panels at home.  Already traveled 4,200 km. <br><br>  Counted.  $ 11.60 per month. <br><br>  Went the second year.  Only $ 600 for maintenance and $ 140 for electricity.  Mileage 61,000 km <br><br>  Ha.  Maybe someone has a negative flow at all. <br>  <i>Answer:</i> Well, we received a $ 14,000 refund from the government.  So, yes. <br><br>  Spoken for 10 months.  Drove 16,500 miles  Spent $ 900 on the Supercharger.  $ 1 for 16 miles. <br><br>  Fill the rays of the sun.  $ 0.15 per installed kWh of solar panels. <br><br>  I have a car for 2 months.  I charge near the work.  So $ 0, except for how much I paid for tinting and a protective paint coating <i>(it is sold under different brands - I made myself the same).</i> <br><br>  90 euros for more than a year and a half and 20,000 km, and that is because piercing tires 3 times and had to be repaired.  I just can‚Äôt think how I could spend even less for a car with 700 hp. <br><br>  Although the prices in different parts of the country are different, we expect that our electricity bill will not increase much.  Still waiting for him, since we own the car only 4 weeks and drove about 3,200 km, paying $ 28 for the Supercharger. <br><br>  The minimum.  I refuel at home in the evenings. <br><br>  $ 30 for electricity for 1,500 miles (2 cents per mile). <br><br>  We have a month Model S and the cost of it is almost zero.  Electricity is cheap, plus we charge for free.  Near the grocery stores free charging Level-2 which gives 22 kWh - recharge while we buy food.  Already traveled 10,000 km. <br><br>  Zero - I have solar panels on the roof. <br>  <i>Put back in 2011.</i>  <i>Then there is a discussion that the solar panels on the roof justify themselves in 4-8 years.</i> <br><br>  I have solar panels, so I did not pay anything before, but now I have about $ 100 a month.  Gasoline for my hybrid cost 2 times more. <br><br>  We have solar panels, so for now nothing but insurance. <br><br>  Check if suddenly your electric company has a return for electric vehicle owners.  Mine gave me back the $ 450 I spent on installing the Tesla Charger (which costs $ 500). <br>  <a href="https://www.sce.com/wps/portal/home/residential/rates/residential-rates">Link to article on returns</a> <br><br>  About $ 80 for a mileage of 7,240 km that I passed from September 26th. <br><br>  Model 3, from May 2018, 14,480 km - a new tire (thanks to the big nail on the road) and about $ 40 for the Supercharger.  Home solar panels, plus a set of winter tires. <br><br>  My electricity bills soared to $ 200 per month - I have solar panels, but they are not enough to power the house and charge the car - you can say that I now fully pay for charging it. <br>  <i>Then she writes that she travels 1,300 km per month, her house uses 2,200 kWh per month and it is hard for her to explain why so much.</i>  <i>And in general, her last electricity bills were $ 500 each ...</i> <br><br>  Only for insurance.  Oh, wait.  More accessories. <br><br>  Charging for a Supercharger costs $ 6.58, i.e.  about $ 0.23 per kWh  At home I pay $ 0.12 per kWh.  I paid $ 160 a month for gasoline.  So, now I spend about 1/3 from the old one. <br><br>  Before Tesla, I drove a diesel minibus.  He paid 700 dollars a month for fuel.  Electricity costs less than 10 cents per kWh.  At work, charging costs 0.15 euros per kWh.  Supercharger for me for free.  Ride is very cheap.  I save $ 600 a month on fuel only, which is good, because I pay $ 1,800 a month for a loan.  Those.  taking into account the savings on fuel, its price is quite reasonable.  It is better to pay Tesla than oil companies. <br><br>  I'm lucky - I charge near the work for free. <br><br>  About $ 1,000 for 32,200 km.  LR RWD Model 3. <br><br>  Spent less than $ 10 on charges outside the home. <br><br>  $ 10 - $ 20 per month for electricity.  Free electricity when traveling where there is a Destination Chargers.  You do not need to buy gasoline and a convenient parking space. <br><br>  Electricity is about $ 70 per month and $ 0 per service (1 month Model X and 3 months Model 3).  My gasoline car ‚Äúdevoured‚Äù $ 400 a month for gasoline and $ 800 a year for oil and other technical items.  service. <br><br>  So far paid only for the installation of their home charging. <br><br>  $ 7.63 for the Supercharger that's all.  We have charging and solar panels. <br><br>  Fines for speeding are considered? <br><br>  Home exercises and winter tires. <br><br>  About $ 260 for electricity at home and on Supercharger and $ 47 per month insurance - 3 months 9,600 km. <br><br>  About $ 70 from August, including 4,800 km, when the Supercharger was used during travel. <br><br>  $ 20 for the Supercharger when tested it.  In addition, zero - charging near the work. <br><br>  16,000 km for free - I charge near the work. <br><br>  About a dollar per charge per night. <br><br>  My house electricity bill fell $ 20 in the first month and $ 15 in the second.  I can not explain why.  I drove 3,200 km, charging only at home. <br><br>  Delivered in late March.  I charge after 11 pm for 1.4 per kWh.  Electricity bill has not changed.  Twice I went on long trips and charged on Supercharger - $ 50.  That's all. <br><br>  0 <br><br>  I charge for free at work. <br><br>  It costs me about 1 cent per mile for electricity.  8,000 miles = $ 80. <br><br>  $ 0.14 kW * x * 10 kW * h charging = $ 1.40 per day.  45 km for $ 1.40 = $ 0.03 km * 1,100 km = $ 34.  I think that the price will fall in the spring when it gets warmer. <br><br>  A couple of times charged on the Supercharger $ 15 for everything about everything.  Already traveled 13,000 miles.  That means about 0.011 cents per mile.  No more spending - balancing the wheels I do myself.  Solar panels houses - i.e.  charge for free. <br><br>  $ 600 for 19,300 km, 0 for electricity, since my solar panels have already paid for themselves. <br><br>  I just received my first electric bill since I bought Model 3. The bill for October was $ 49 higher than for the same month last year. <br><br>  Electricity fees increased by about $ 50. <br><br>  I pay $ 20 more for electricity, $ 110 less for gasoline. <br><br>  I charge my Model S at home in 90% of cases, which costs me less than $ 0.1 CAD per kWh, which translates to 1/10 of what I paid for my BMW for the same distance.  Other expenses?  Tires will probably ‚Äúrun out‚Äù faster than on BMW ... My Model 3 is 10-20% more efficient than Model S - i.e.  will be cheaper.  And yes, on Model 3 I get more driving pleasure. <br><br>  Already traveled 3,220 km.  So far, that $ 0.  But today I am going on a 13-hour journey, where I plan to spend from $ 20 to $ 40 on the Supercharger. <br><br>  We also have solar panels - we do not pay for electricity, only for tires and wiper blades.  Travel is also very cheap.  We spent less than $ 100 for a Supercharger driving more than 4,800 km across 12 states from Florida to Michigan and back. <br><br>  $ 0 ... I do not charge at home, only at work and on the Supercharger. <br><br>  75 bucks for a button on the door. <br><br>  No idea.  I charge at home and did not notice the difference in electricity bills. <br><br>  0 ... Charging near work. <br><br>  We bought two Tesla's in 2017. The electricity bill has not increased since then, but we changed all the lights to LED at home.  But the fact that the bill for gasoline decreased by $ 600 we noticed. <br><br>  Expenses for a chiropractor have risen - too many problems with the neck.  But, at least the neck muscles have become stronger.  <i>For those who have not slept enough - this is a joke about overload during acceleration.</i> <br><br>  Zero dollars ... Charging near work. <br><br>  0, Supercharger. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/on/oy/st/onoystnynhkn4oi1_mruib3cvdg.jpeg"><br><br>  <b>Findings:</b> <br><br><ul><li>  Judging by the comments, we can say that most Tesla owners either pay nothing for charging and maintenance, or pay very little. </li><li>  A significant part of charge their electric cars near work. </li><li>  Many use the Supercharger network from time to time. </li><li>  Many people charge from their home charging. </li><li>  A significant number of writers have solar panels.  It was a pleasant surprise. </li><li>  It is suspected that tires wear out faster than non-electric vehicles. </li><li>  When traveling, almost everyone uses the Supercharger, while the cost per mile is still significantly less than in the case of ICE. </li></ul><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/lc/66/4v/lc664vkn3n3uvrangyrsxwbkicq.jpeg"><br><br>  <b>Update</b> <br><br>  Some comments under this article about the cost of car maintenance. <br><br>  <b>Electric cars:</b> <br><br>  We had a Model S, then we decided that we needed a bigger car, bought a Model X, and sold the Model S. <br>  The difference in price between the new and the used car is about the same level as for the petrol premium models, in 2014 it was bought for 100 thousand without change, in 2018 it was sold for 70 thousand without change. <br>  There were no expenses, except for the payment for the annual service (there was a prepaid package, 2000 for 4 services). <br>  Nothing flowed, did not break from the word at all. <br>  Zero euro is spent on electricity, zero cents, you can charge in a thousand places for free, if you set such a goal, well, supercharges - they are also free, they used to be for everyone, now only for those who ordered by reference.  Who needs a reference - write, I have :) <br><br>  And in the United States and Canada, thousands of free charges (mostly Level 2) ‚Äúnobody watches‚Äù - i.e.  who on the city budget.  I myself constantly charge for these - one of them, by the way, is near my work, the other is not far from home.  Those.  I also spend on charging (and while on maintenance) $ 0 per month. <br><br>  <b>with ICE:</b> <br><br>  Lada Kalina 2012 release. <br>  From January 1, 87,451 r: <br>  41,760 r.  - gasoline <br>  18 180 p.  - parking. <br>  27 511 r.  - maintenance (THAT, omyvayka, wipers, a pair of detached gum on the luggage rack - in general, all costs that were not included in the previous categories) <br>  From September 6, 2016 (when I started accounting at all) 233 304 r: <br>  101 846 r.  - gasoline <br>  47 460 p.  - parking. <br>  83,998 r.  - service <br><br>  The average consumption of 22-23 liters (city), mileage - ~ 10k per year, of which 9k - the city.  Only fuel costs about $ 500 at a fuel price of $ 1.1 \ liter.  4 times a year, I change the oil and oil filter - $ 150 for oil + filter + work, as a result, $ 600 per year.  Cabin Filter - $ 50.  2 air filters - $ 100.  Candles - $ 300 (every couple of years).  In this scenario, ~ $ 1,250-1,300 a year comes out.  But it is without any repairs. <br><br>  Suzuki XL-7 2006, dates from 03/10/2017 to today (12.11.2018) in thousand rubles: <br>  Renovation: 99.5 (old car ...) <br>  Consumables: 59.5 (ate a lot of new tires winters. + Years.) <br>  Others (radio, hitch, etc.): 19.2 <br>  Fuel: 85 (consumption 13 on the highway, 16 mixed, in winter in the city up to 22l \ 100km) for 22'000km mileage <br><br>  And I can answer in the spirit of this meaningless article :) <br>  Range Rover, 2015, gasoline. <br>  Mileage 115,000. <br>  Costs: <br>  Cloths for cleaning the cabin - about 15,000 rubles (it's all a wife). <br>  Everything else is serviced and paid by my company, including fuel. <br>  The cost of operating 15000 / (115000) = 13 kopecks per kilometer.  Very profitable car, I think :) <br><br>  Granta-liftback 2017 year on the automatic torque converter. <br>  Run about 18820 km. <br>  From the time of purchase (~ 11 months): <br>  * fuel ~ 54420 <br>  * set of normal summer tires ~ 12500 <br>  * replacement of rims round the ~ 3200 <br>  * TO-1 ~ 5100 <br>  * washing and other trifles ~ 11000 <br>  Total about 86220 rubles for an incomplete year, and about 4 rubles 60 kopecks per kilometer. <br><br>  Audi A4 2005, 2.0 Diesel <br>  from 01.07.2018 to today: <br>  Mileage: 5400km <br>  $ 450 fuel <br>  $ 385 - current repair <br>  $ 600 - maintenance (oil change, filters, insurance, winter tires, washing, etc.) <br><br>  Let's calculate how much I would spend on gas, if I drove this car every day, we‚Äôll take 20 liters per hundred km as an average consumption.  On my other car for the year I drove about 20 thousand km.  We get 4000 liters of gasoline per year, even if it costs 45 rubles per liter, it is 180 thousand rubles per year.  We add another 50 thousand rubles a year for maintenance and repairs, we get 230 thousand rubles a year.  How much is the cheapest electric power worth 3.1 million rubles? <br><br>  <b>To resolve some disputes:</b> <br><br>  <a href="https://habr.com/post/413371/">In this article on Habr</a> there is a comparison of "electric fights" against cars with internal combustion engines. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/429554/">https://habr.com/ru/post/429554/</a></p>
