  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Exherbo - a new milestone in the development of source-based distributors</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Once upon a time, I was a fan of Gentoo Linux and put it wherever I could: at home, at work, on servers, but I was soon forced to switch to Debian GNU / Linux and FreeBSD because every update started to generate more New problems - some of the necessary packages were not collected at all, some were expired, some had to be patched manually, and for some, the installation in the package files was also corrected.  Now it is difficult to say exactly when it started, many say that this is due to the fact that many developers have left the project due to diverging views on the future fate of Gentoo.  And, despite the fact that the situation has somehow stabilized, the group of ‚Äúmigrants‚Äù from Gentoo decided to create their own distribyutiv, which would be consistent with the old concept of Gentoo, the one with which he came to the world, and with whom he fell in love the beginning of the journey.  So, welcome - Exherbo! <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>  Exherbo is a distributor designed for those who know why and why they chose Linux.  Much of his concept was drawn from already existing source-based distributors, in particular, this is the possibility of flexible installation with pre-configuration (the user indicates that he needs / does not need specifically, flags and options for compiling packages). <br><br>  Exherbo is also not an offshoot of any project, despite the fact that the distribution code is used in others, despite the fact that many of the concepts are similar, and despite the fact that many team members also participate / participated in the development of other distribution networks, a large part of Exherbo code written from scratch.

      Exherbo is not yet a distributor, ready for use by a wide range of end users, such as Ubuntu.  Most of its packages are those that were prepared by people interested in the project (in fact, the development team), only those packages that they found interesting and useful in their daily work, it‚Äôs even possible that Exherbo does not include yours at the moment favorite table cover or music player.  But the situation with the number of packages will improve with time, although even now there are many ways to build the necessary software on their own, in the end, this is a source-based distribution, which means that the user chooses here, and not the developer, who believes that this package is for all users need / don't need <br><br>  The emergence of Exherbo did not come from the thought that all modern distributors are disgusting, but that you can create something that would more suit the needs of each particular user, well, or even your own, be flexible and customizable.  <s>There was already an attempt to create such on the basis of one well-known source-based distributor (Gentoo), but he was not compelled to become a viable long-term project.</s>  (let's better discuss Exherbo than the opinion of Exherbo developers regarding Gentoo) <br><br>  <a href="http://exherbo.org/">Official site of the project</a> <br>  <a href="http://irc//irc.freenode.net/exherbo">The official IRC channel of the project in the Freenode network</a> <br><br>  <i>This habratopic is partially a translation of the text from <a href="http://exherbo.org/">exherbo.org</a> , the <a href="http://exherbo.org/">official site of the project</a> .</i> <br></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/44687/">https://habr.com/ru/post/44687/</a></p>
