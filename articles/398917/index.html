  <section class="page js-page"><h1>11.11: it's time to waste everything in bachelor</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Despite the penetration of Asian culture, the spread of Chinese online stores and close international links, we still know too little about China.  For example, it is difficult to find an example of a holiday that is rooted in rather sad events, but in fact it is perhaps the most cheerful, active, and even the craziest day of the year.  If you try to understand the origins, it becomes clear not quite obvious things.  Today we will tell a little about them.  And at the same time about how JD.ru plans to join the sale madness and what gadgets we have in store. <br><br> <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/jd/blog/282196/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e13/dc8/0b3/e13dc80b32bd4983964891b4e756f947.jpg"></a> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  <font color="#c30023">Solitude day</font> </h2><br>  11.11 - the day of the bachelor (guangunjie) in China is practically the youngest holiday, which appeared in the 90s of the XX century.  It originated in a progressive university environment as a reaction to unpopular government policies.  In overpopulated China, childlessness is encouraged in every way (after the introduction of the law on birth control, according to which the family could not have more than one child), and as one of the forms to achieve it is a single life.  In addition, the policy of the last decades, aimed at giving priority to the birth of boys in families, has generated a demographic imbalance: there are 10 guys per 8 girls there.  So, there are definitely a lot of bachelors in society who, nevertheless, dream of having a family, therefore they celebrate 11.11 very violently, walking around restaurants with friends, participating in blind dates and ... buying everything. <br><br>  And the point is not that around sales and discounts, but that this is what tradition demands.  The word bachelor (in Chinese translated as "bare stick") consists of two hieroglyphs, the first of which has the meaning "completely, cleaned, without a trace."  That is why lonely men strive to pull out all their pocket money on this day, drink and eat everything at home, dine in a restaurant, buy new goods.  Otherwise, superstitious Chinese are sure that fate in the new year will not be very favorable for them and they are unlikely to meet their life companion.  Of course, this fact could not be overlooked by cunning marketers, and in the late 2010s, with the light hand of Chinese retail, international shopping day appeared - 11.11.  Today, it was even adopted by Russian and Western stores, and, above all, online retailers.

      JD.ru has been in Russia for over a year now, we conducted several interesting experiments with Russian Post, tested the showroom, delivered hundreds of tons of packages, introduced users to our JD Collection.  And now, when our friendship with the Russian buyer has gone through several stages and got stronger, we decided to make a <a href="http://sale.jd.ru/act/cDUrj6Bakwy4oJI.html">real madness</a> - and it doesn‚Äôt matter to us whether you are single or not.  Choose gadgets for yourself and those close to you, get ready for the new year - we are ready for the most powerful avalanche of orders. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#c30023">JD.ru team selection</font> </h2><br>  Our team has carefully approached the selection of interesting gadgets and not less gambling activities.  But first things first.  First of all - about the collection of JD, in which goods are sold directly from the store.  Accordingly, we are responsible for shipping, warranty service and product quality.  But at the same time we reduce, we cut, we cut down - in general, we reduce prices. <br><br>  The first good news is the price of <b>$ 158</b> (a 28% discount) on a <a href="http://www.jd.ru/838658.html">Nubia My Prague</a> smartphone with 2GB of RAM and 16GB of built-in, 5.2-inch screen and work in LTE networks.  It is a pleasure to see this phone and hold it in hands - it is thin, perfectly assembled, the case despite the size fits perfectly even in the most elegant hand.  By the way, about the elegant - if you have a girlfriend, wife or sister, you can safely pack this model under the Christmas tree.  The smartphone will win the lovers of selfies and vintage filters - for this, the front camera is built into the device as much as 8 megapixels and the main 13 megapixels with modes of selecting the most successful photo and a set of refined filters (almost steeper than Prism, because it is more realistic).  A nice bonus is the great sound of the player in the smartphone.  Because of the ultra-thin case, the Nubia is equipped with a 2200 mAh battery, but it can recover 25% of the charge in just 10 minutes. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/b96/312/e05/b96312e05b3defdf596359ba33c336ab.jpg"></div><br>  For business people and black lovers there is a <a href="http://www.jd.ru/201593.html">Nubia Z9 mini</a> smartphone - a smartphone that is very much in demand by our customers at a price of <b>$ 140</b> .  The smartphone is equipped with a rigid frame with the use of aviation alloy, resistant to corrosion and temperature changes (very soon we will drag our phones from the cold into heat and back).  The back cover is made of a pleasant to the touch material with a texture, due to which it looks especially black.  The stuffing is not less impressive than the build: the 64-bit 8-core Snapdragon 615 processor with the Adreno 405 graphics processor not only works smartly, but also allows you to play the most loaded games.  2GB RAM, built-in - 16GB, 16 megapixel camera, 5-inch screen, 2900 mAh battery. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/1dc/404/3b1/1dc4043b10f63029341fc0e9f7d8f3e3.jpg"></div><br>  From the protected smartphones, we, perhaps, select the <a href="http://www.jd.ru/1219741.html">Doogee T5 S</a> - a waterproof and shockproof phone with a 5-inch screen for <b>$ 98.99</b> .  IP67 protection class.  On board, the operating system is Android 6.0, 2GB of RAM and built-in 16GB, OTG (the ability to serve as a power bank for other devices), 8 and 5 megapixel cameras.  The battery corresponds to the brutal nature of the device - 4500 mAh.  You can buy one for yourself as a spare phone, choose for travelers or donate to your schoolchild, who cannot justify himself by the fact that the battery is dead.  The model will outwardly stand out among the standard smooth monoblocks. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/95e/8d0/bd2/95e8d0bd262ec7dbddb1662d295ed583.jpg"></div><br>  By the way, about the clamoring brothers, sisters and children of our smaller ones.  There are many interesting things for them in the sale besides smartphones, but we chose two budget and at the same time reliable options: <br>  <a href="http://www.jd.ru/1223219.html">UMI ROME X</a> smartphone for <b>$ 65.99</b> (by the way, it is played in our <a href="http://sale.jd.ru/act/cDUrj6Bakwy4oJI.html">Good Luck Wheel</a> ) and <a href="http://www.jd.ru/1136282.html">Doogee X5 Max</a> 3G Smartphone for <b>$ 61.00</b> .  Both onboard have 1GB of RAM and 8GB of internal memory.  But, unlike the UMI ROME X with a 2500 mAh battery, the Doogee X5 is equipped with 4000 mAh.  Both of these solutions are ideal for children in the form of the first almost adult smartphone: on the one hand, with such modest characteristics you don‚Äôt drive into tanchiki, and on the other, a full-fledged smartphone with Internet access, useful applications and a long-playing battery, and this is always in touch with parents.  The child is happy gift, mom and dad are calm. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/730/960/c5e/730960c5ef21cdc8851968335c50d8fa.png"><br><br>  But if your whole family is packed with smartphones to capacity, then the JD Collection presents a lot of interesting products in all categories.  We chose three cool models that not only perform their function, but also serve as assistants and inspirators in work and, for example, sports. <br><br>  The <a href="http://www.jd.ru/1209935.html">MEIZU inter-</a> channel <a href="http://www.jd.ru/1209935.html">Bluetooth headphones are</a> simply indispensable in the gym and during winter sports - they ‚Äúfinish off‚Äù the phone at a distance of up to 10 meters, and you no longer have to painfully hide the player in stingy spartsal clothing, put it in his pockets, in his belt, underwear or put on a cup stand on the simulator, at the risk of losing or damaging the device during an intense workout.  Everything is simple here - we fixed it on the back of our head, we chose our favorite music - and more.  Weigh headphones only about 7 grams, and are at a 25% discount of only <b>$ 33.34</b> . <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/0f3/c5e/b77/0f3c5eb77e1e5e6114b605b0545ef0a0.jpg"></div><br>  <a href="http://www.jd.ru/1167849.html">Xiaomi (MI)</a> wired <a href="http://www.jd.ru/1167849.html">headphones</a> for <b>$ 75.74</b> fit for work, play and comfortable music alone.  They have a very beautiful design and very well thought-out ergonomics - they are made in golden-black color, have soft well-fitting ears and a bezel, Kevlar elements of wires.  This model sits comfortably on the head and does not let the sound out.  With apparent massiveness, the headphones weigh only 200 grams.  Headphone sensitivity is 100 dB, power is 100 milliwatts, frequencies - 20-20000 Hz. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/9a0/c80/296/9a0c80296200a07e6e8f0a98a4b12772.jpg"></div><br>  Well, if we are talking about sports, how can we not tell that the <a href="http://www.jd.ru/1154088.html">Xiaomi fitness bracelet</a> costs only <b>$ 17.77</b> .  A simple and incredibly popular device works for 30 days without recharging, accurately counts the steps, is compatible with Xiaomi and iPhone smartphones and counts the pulse. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/242/ac2/678/242ac26786f3f9741192b4b962ee31be.jpg"></div><br><h2>  <font color="#c30023">Another couple of interesting smartphones</font> </h2><br>  The JD site presents a variety of products from verified vendors.  Among the lots there are brands that have successfully won hundreds of thousands of fans around the world.  For example, Xiaomi.  JD has many models of this brand, but our team opted for two: <a href="http://www.jd.ru/1191475.html">Xiaomi Redmi 3S</a> for <b>$ 135.99</b> and <a href="http://www.jd.ru/1198063.html">Xiaomi Max</a> for <b>$ 184.99</b> .  For such a price, the user gets far from low-end models.  Judge for yourself.  <i>Xiaomi Redmi 3S</i> primarily supports the official system update (firmware).  On its 5-inch board, 3GB of RAM, 32GB of internal memory, eight cores, a Qualcomm Snapdragon 430 processor, a 13 megapixel main camera, and an embedded 5 megapixel camera.  The operating system is MIUI 7 Android 6.0 OS Lollipop.  For $ 135 this is a worthy New Year's gift to any member of the family: from a son who asks for an adult cell phone to a business respectable dad. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/055/286/9d5/0552869d5c33518d06f2964e099591fb.jpg"></div><br>  Similarly, supports the update and <i>Xiaomi Max</i> - 6,44-inch, but not a giant.  The smartphone is nicely located even in a woman's hand, perfectly kept and extremely convenient for keyboard input.  Although one hand there is no use, if you are not Gulliver.  The smartphone is suitable as a business person in the form of a calling tablet, and a girl student who needs a tablet to study, but you don‚Äôt want to carry two devices in your purse at once.  In terms of stuffing, he is ahead of his fellow - 16 and 5 megapixel cameras, the MIUI V8 operating system on Android 6.0 (by the way, a convenient and thoughtful shell), a more advanced 64bit Qualcomm Snapdragon 650, 3GB RAM, 32GB processor - built-in.  In addition, all this power is equipped with a 4850 mAh battery - a larger <s>ship</s> smartphone has more power. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/509/1b0/a10/5091b0a10947fa6b3b23218403792a82.jpg"></div><br><h2>  <font color="#c30023">Mad madness</font> </h2><br>  In general, we advise to follow <a href="http://sale.jd.ru/act/cDUrj6Bakwy4oJI.html">our landing</a> every day, since there will be several activities at once, right up to the most violent, enchanting, etc.  11.11. <br><br><ul><li>  Actually, the very epic sale from 9 November.  Be sure to check out the new flash sales! <br><br></li><li>  For newly registered users (on the entire website) Ôºö daily from October 25 to November 13 from 10:00 Moscow time, the first 500 registered users will automatically receive a coupon of $ 5, you can use the coupon when ordering from $ 8. <br><br></li><li>  Flash sales from November 9 to 13 at 10:00, 14:00, 18:00, 22:00 Moscow time.  Check the clock!  In flash sales there will be extremely low prices.  For example, the older brother of the above described Doogee Max with LTE and more advanced stuffing will cost $ 59.99.  A monopod can be bought for two and a half dollars. There will also be power banks, Xiaomi gadgets and a lot of everything you need and enjoy. <br><br></li><li>  Limited editions of coupons for $ 5, $ 10, $ 20, $ 30, and so randomly up to $ 70 from November 1 to 9 at 10:00 and 14:00 Moscow time - only for the JD collection. <br><br></li><li>  Lottery <a href="http://sale.jd.ru/act/cDUrj6Bakwy4oJI.html">Wheel of Good Luck</a> , in which you can try your luck once a day from 1 to 8 November and win a smartphone, a telescope and coupons $ 50 and $ 70. <br><br></li><li>  For fans of social networks, some cool contests are prepared on our <a href="https://vk.com/jd">VKontakte page</a> . <br><br></li><li>  Discounts from partner stores are also very generous. <br></li></ul><br>  We are already preparing for you new interesting and even unexpected collections.  Of course, Russia is not China, and hardly anyone believes that if you pull all the money, there will be a second half.  Here, rather, on the contrary.  But the sale 11.11 - the best time to stock up on gifts for the New Year.  First, in Chinese stores it will not be cheaper, even on Black Friday - it already has such magical powers for the Middle Kingdom.  Secondly, the goods will have time to get to the most remote corners.  Thirdly, you unload your pre-New Year efforts.  In general, there are enough arguments.  So time to look at virtual storefronts and not to miss good discounts. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/398917/">https://habr.com/ru/post/398917/</a></p>
