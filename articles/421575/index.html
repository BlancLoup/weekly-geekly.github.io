      Interfax <a href="http://www.interfax.ru/russia/626966">announced</a> that Yandex is going to appeal the <a href="https://habr.com/post/421515/">decision of the Moscow City Court</a> to remove pirated content from the Yandex.Video search results. <br><br>  The press service of Yandex issued a statement, which, inter alia, stated the following: <br><blockquote>  In accordance with the law ‚ÄúOn Information, Information Technologies and Information Protection,‚Äù the mechanic is this: pirated content is blocked on the side of the site owner and on the so-called ‚Äúmirrors‚Äù of this site. <br><br>  Blocking requirements do not apply to search engines.  The system has been working this way for a long time. <br><br>  Now, in response to the appeal of the TV channels, the Moscow City Court has made definitions that are fundamentally contrary to its own previous practice on this issue.  Worse, they do not solve the problems of controversial content, as resources with such content will be available in other search engines, social networks and so on. <br><br>  We consider the claims against us unfounded and not in compliance with the legislation and we will appeal the rulings of the Moscow City Court. </blockquote><br><br>  According to company representatives, in order to find a solution to the problem, Yandex is hoping for cooperation with market participants ‚Äúwithin the framework of the existing legal framework.‚Äù  It was also noted that Yandex is in favor of high-quality legal content for users, on which rightholders earn "legitimate money."  The company brought its services "Yandex.Music" and "Kinopoisk" as evidence of the possibility of the existence of such a symbiosis. <br><br>  If pirated content is not deleted, the Yandex.Video service will be blocked, even if it appeals the decision of the Moscow City Court, Deputy Head of Roskomnadzor Vadim Subbotin told TASS correspondent. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Let me remind you that the situation began its development when TNT, TV-3, 2x2, Super channels broadcast a statement to the Moscow City Court demanding to take preliminary security measures for the Yandex resource.  In particular, they asked to suppress the appearance in the search results of ‚ÄúYandex‚Äù videos from sites where the TV series ‚ÄúHouse arrest‚Äù, ‚ÄúOut of Game‚Äù, the show ‚ÄúMystical Stories‚Äù and the animated series ‚ÄúCaution, Earthlings‚Äù are illegally posted. <br><br>  In general, claims against Yandex about the distribution of links to pirated resources may not be groundless, although their scale may be deliberately exaggerated.  RBC <a href="https://www.rbc.ru/technology_and_media/25/05/2018/5b07d6cc9a7947857aaeb407%3Fstory%3D5af980859a7947b069a0a9d3">remembers the words</a> of Oleg Tumanov, head of the ivi.ru online cinema, who on May 25, 2018 at the SPIEF suggested that <i>Yandex‚Äôs share in the traffic of the top 10 pirated resources is 78%</i> .  Alexander Akopov, a member of the board of the Association of Film and Television Producers, co-founder of the production company Cosmos Studio, also said at the SPIEF that, in his opinion <i>, Yandex was the main pirate site at that time</i> . <br><br>  Kommersant, in the light of the current situation, <a href="https://www.kommersant.ru/doc/3725773">refreshed memories</a> of the previous similar precedent in the Russian market: <br><blockquote>  Suffice it to recall the French Dailymotion - the third most visited video hosting in the world after YouTube and Vimeo.  Back in January 2017, according to the suit of the Friday channel, which is part of the holding, Dailymotion was blocked for life in Russia.  Already after the parties tried to negotiate a settlement, but it turned out that the lifelong lock under the law can not be canceled. </blockquote><br><br>  <b>UPD</b> On August 29, <a href="https://russian.rt.com/nopolitics/news/549248-yandeks-memorandum-piratstvo">it became known</a> that in addition to the refusal to remove ‚Äúpirated‚Äù links from search results, Yandex did not sign the <i>Memorandum on Combating Piracy on the Internet</i> , which is an initiative of Roskomnadzor.  The memorandum in the current edition requires revision, and the company is open for cooperation, the press service of Yandex reported. <br><br>  <b>UPD2</b> in the evening of August 30, 2018 <a href="https://vc.ru/44676-yandeks-udalil-iz-poiska-po-video-ssylki-na-serialy-gazprom-media-posle-ugrozy-blokirovki">Yandex surrendered</a> .  Yandex has removed links to the Gazprom-Media series from the video search after the threat of blocking.  The company removed all controversial links, among which could be legal content.  The results of the survey on Habr√© were prophetic. <br><br><blockquote>  <b>A warning at the request of the site administration:</b> ‚ÄúWhen commenting on this material, please follow the rules.  Please refrain from insults and toxic behavior.  The postmoderation works in the comments. ‚Äù </blockquote></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/421575/">https://habr.com/ru/post/421575/</a></p>
