Specialists who select Central Asia, come up with creative banners, as well as create and conduct advertising campaigns, are called arbitrageurs.  From their work depends on the number of downloads of your application, its position in the ranks, and, as a consequence, the final profit. <br><br>  Many advertisers go for traffic to advertising agencies, which already have entire departments for the purchase of traffic, or to agencies that work directly with freelancers: arbitrageurs or webmasters. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b9e/02b/06f/b9e02b06f35b4ce1a73ef0a555ba9db2.png">

      Today, the competition for the user is very high, and in order to receive downloads at a reasonable price for the Unit-economy, you need to use many different approaches and constantly learn to "pour". <br><br>  <a href="http://mobio.ru/">Mobio</a> employs more than 20 arbitrators, who attract 250,000 installations daily for clients from all over the world.  In this post, we would like to share the basic techniques and approaches in the arbitration of mobile traffic. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h3>  Mobile traffic arbitration </h3><br>  For the definition, we usually use the following formula: <br><br>  <b>Arbitrage = Science + Art</b> , where <br><br><ul><li>  <b>Science</b> : analytics, math and tests </li><li>  <b>Art</b> : creatives and marketing </li></ul><br>  Proper combination of the above concepts is the key to a successful advertising campaign.  A good arbitrator should be diligent, able to focus properly (1 source, 1 offer) and not be upset if 90% of his work is a failure and only 10% is a success. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/05c/e1a/226/05ce1a226bed45cab5ff3bc1a4823126.jpg"><br><br><h3>  Outsource or own team? </h3><br>  Of course, having your own team of arbitrators is better.  But there are both pluses and minuses: <br><table><tbody><tr><td>  pros </td><td>  Minuses </td></tr><tr><td>  Easier to ensure traffic transparency <br></td><td>  Few experienced market arbitragers, you need to teach yourself <br></td></tr><tr><td>  There is an opportunity to take more interesting client projects. <br></td><td>  It's hard to make a win-win for the arbitrators <br></td></tr><tr><td>  The presence of internal expertise and knowledge (you do not know, you doubt, ask!) - one head is good, but two, three, five, etc. are many times better </td><td>  Long-term investment, which repels only with the growth of expertise and technology </td></tr><tr><td>  Accumulating knowledge - the ability to quickly scale <br></td><td>  Scaling requires processes and technologies. <br></td></tr></tbody></table><br>  Working in a team, it is possible to test various verticals and advertising platforms.  After the test, hundreds of offers make it easy to understand which banners and which ads are better at different topics, be it Travel, E-commerce, Dating, Games or Utilities. <br><br>  Now we already know the working bundles and approaches to each vertical, platform and geo, thus, we manage to avoid many mistakes in the future.  But there is no development without mistakes, the main thing is not to be afraid of stuffing cones, otherwise there‚Äôs no way to earn experience, and with experience and profit.  A simple example of creating creatives for the ticket sales application: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b6e/4a8/be9/b6e4a8be9fcf415bb09578e2f51d1a3b.jpg"><br><br>  You can also use the following phrases: <br><br><ul><li>  Eagle and Reshka recommend. </li><li>  Will help plan a vacation. </li><li>  The number of cheap NG tickets has decreased by 23% over the past month. </li></ul><br>  A good example of arbitrage marketing is Aviasales.  Guys quickly track trends and often get a lot of traffic due to this. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/870/c30/541/870c30541ec74171bc966ed6a9b26a3b.png"><br><br>  As you can see in the above examples, an important role in mobile advertising is the creativity of banners, since the performance indicators directly depend on this: <br><br><ul><li>  Better banner - higher CTR - cheaper clicks </li><li>  Better banner - higher CR - cheaper install </li></ul><br>  Banner creativity is a full-fledged separate topic for the article, we will tell about it later. <br><br><h3>  Narrow targeting </h3><br>  The key to success of this method lies in correctly selected narrow target audience of the application and banners for it.  Banners should be clearly selected for the audience by color, image, style, terms, slang, etc. <br><br>  A couple of examples: <br><br>  <strong>1.</strong> We select groups according to the meaning: maternity hospitals, breastfeeding, pregnancy, January, February, April, etc. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/13f/ba8/225/13fba8225cc344bfa80607f645740a17.png"><br><br>  <strong>2.</strong> We take creativity and make target: All women, all of Russia, iOS.  The result is a CTR of 0.86%, CR of 14%. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/4b3/51e/928/4b351e9286fa41eab84cc5818b78b5ba.jpg"><br><br>  Through Cerebro / Segmento Parsim public audience for moms, about childbirth, pregnancy, etc.  ID Targeting, All Russia, iOS.  Result: CTR 1.5% (+ 0.64%), CR 18% (+ 4%). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/4f5/f70/6fc/4f5f706fcc6f448e9b5c88859b4a251f.jpg"><br><br>  Narrow targeting allows you to achieve higher margins than when using wide targeting, but you need to remember that the number of installations will be less than when targeting a wide audience.  Here you need to build on the goals you are pursuing. <br><br><h3>  7 Sins </h3><br>  This approach is based on the well-known weaknesses of a person: laziness, greed, envy, pride, anger, despondency and lust. <br><br>  It is very effective to apply this method in Dating, creating a separate advertising message for each ‚Äúsin‚Äù.  Example: <br><br>  <b>Laziness</b> : ‚ÄúGuaranteed dates in your city.  Search 3km around you, only beautiful girls.  30 seconds registration.  Many of our girls want to go on a date today. ‚Äù <br>  <b>Greed:</b> "Get ready to meet at least 1 new girl a week after registering with this application." <br>  <b>Envy</b> : ‚Äú7% of men get 54% of all female likes and comments.  How do they do it?  At first they registered on this site. ‚Äù <br>  <b>Pride</b> : "Your ex will hate you when it sees alongside these stunning girls." <br>  <b>Anger</b> : ‚ÄúHow dare she not answer you?  Before you lose hope, calm down!  And sign up on this site to meet girls who give you a chance. ‚Äù <br>  <b>Disappointment</b> : "It is a shame that there is still no girl?  Lonely at home?  Register on the site. " <br>  <b>Lust</b> : ‚ÄúWant to have fun night?  Many of our girls are looking for a guy for tonight. ‚Äù <br><br>  A few more life hacking to generate approaches: <br><br><ul><li>  We study the target audience (reviews of applications in the pages show the pain and desire of users), read reviews of competitors, press releases and reviews; </li><li>  Constantly monitor ads in AdMobiSpy and Publer.  We look at how others are advertised and notice; </li><li>  We track trends of social networks, popular applications, memes on Popsters; </li><li>  We study Wordstat and what users are looking for. </li></ul><br><h3>  Automation </h3><br>  The next step to get the best result is the automation of work with advertising sites: <br><br><ul><li>  Scripts on the launch of a new offer </li><li>  Scripts for scaling offers for volumes </li><li>  Bidding: CPM vs CPC </li><li>  Working with targeting, look and so on </li></ul><br>  This is a big topic, and in the following posts we will focus on it in more detail. <br><br>  The first post comes to an end.  We will be happy feedback and ready to answer questions.
