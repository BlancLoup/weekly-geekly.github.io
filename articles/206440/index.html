    <h5>  About all scientific competitions of schoolchildren in Ukraine </h5><br>  The main part of the readers is still from Russia, but these things are arranged in approximately the same way.  I will talk about chemistry, because more in the subject.  On other subjects, everything is about the same, programmers, as far as I know, are deprived of the subject of tournaments.  There are three main types of competitions, which take place in stages of the type school-district-region-country.  Successful performance in the last two stages gives a bonus to the result of the EIT (exam on the type of EGE).  Although usually the student who won the republican stage, writes his left foot on 195 out of 200. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h6>  Subject Olympiads </h6><br>  This topic on Habr√© periodically pops up.  These competitions are individual.  Schoolchildren arrive at the appointed time at the appointed place, receive a set of tasks and solve them for three hours on their own.  Set off - separate by parallels.  Winners go to the next stage.  Those who relatively successfully spoke at the regional stage (1 and 2 places, about 10 people from the parallel) go to university for training camps, where they actually follow the program of the first three courses of the relevant faculty, which is slightly lightened and sharpened under the olympiad tasks.  After that there is an intermediate qualifying stage, following the results of which a team is formed for the all-Ukrainian stage.  The size of the team depends on the last year's result of the regional team.  It can be from 4 to 12 people in total for grades 8-11.  The team may not be larger than the quota.  The prize-winners in the 10th grade go to the Mendeleev Olympiad, which used to be All-Union, and in the 11th grade - to the International Olympiad.  Mendeleevka and Internar diplomas make it very preferable to enter at all at any university around the globe. <br><br><h6>  Tournaments of young scientists </h6><br>  It's the other way around.  Competition team assignments are published six months before.  The questions are very ambiguous and imply a multiplicity of solutions.  It is necessary not only to solve the task, but also to clearly report it, and reasonably criticize the enemy.  In this case, you can not offer your solution.  A classic example of the job - Develop a way to create a firearm on an uninhabited island.  And 7 minutes on the report, spin as you like.  The original concept of the tournament meant the tasks are simple and understandable at the first reading, but interesting and discussed.  Then I went very bad trend in my opinion care in a serious science.  The tournament has become a competition for team coaches and finding out which of them has a dissertation more similar to a given task.  Now everything seems to be returning to normal, though at the price of a fall in interestingness.  I try to increase the level to the best of my ability, sent a package of interesting and easily realized tasks to the head of the jury.  <a href="http://cheklab.ru/archives/4003">cheklab.ru/archives/4003</a> - a good and detailed report on the topic.  The tournament does not give bonuses for admission, because the event is a team.  There is a personal offset, but it is symbolic and rather subjective. <br><br><h6>  Small Academy of Sciences </h6><br>  Abbreviated - MAN.  This is science in its purest form.  A schoolboy under the strict guidance of a scientific teacher writes a scientific work; in the weight category, the work received corresponds approximately to the course work.  Then he writes a test paper on the type of Olympiad of the appropriate level and reports the work to the high jury.  The result is the sum of points for the control and report.  Winners go to the next stage.  There are no divisions into classes, but usually the advantage is given secretly to the 11th class.  They need more, and work with them is usually more serious.  There is a very wide range of sections and topics, from veterinary medicine to information system security.  In view of my specialization, I sit tightly in a richly populated section of chemistry, there is no place to move.  And there is some probability that the ward can be forcibly expelled to another section.  In general, the problem is the same as it was in the tournaments.  Under the guise of work, they love to insert a piece of the dissertation of the head.  And it develops into a competition, who has a more expensive device in the laboratory.  Such works are more scientific, but they are farther from the school and at the same time some high and interestingness is lost.  By the way, this is the only competition described in which I did not participate as a schoolboy.  Patience is not enough, well, the head was not.  So, in order to compensate for the losses a year and a half ago, I started slowly tossing into the Gugldo file a list of potentially interesting and realizable topics at the school level.  And wait until a suitable schoolboy appears, so that you can do this with him.  And in July of this year the schoolboy appeared. <br>  In this competition, a lot depends on the manager.  When for two years I judged the regional stage in the strongest area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe city, it was very clearly visible which of the students were trained at school, and whom at the base of the university.  Just the first words of the report.  And the schoolchildren, who epically collapsed because of the manager's file, were simply pitiful. <br><br><h5>  About the formulation of the problem </h5><br>  When I read the post about pulsed electrolysis, the idea was formed immediately.  The outbreaks were characteristic yellow in color, apparently from the atomic emission of sodium contained in water.  If we obtain the spectrum of this glow and measure its intensity at a wavelength of 589 nm, then there should be a dependence on the sodium content in water.  So the topic of work for greater weight, scientific knowledge and compliance of the chemistry section was formulated as follows: ‚ÄúAtomic emission determination of sodium in mineral water using a flyback generator for spark atomization of the sample.‚Äù  Well, what - to play science, so on solid. <br><br><h5>  Essence of the work </h5><br>  We get the plasma above the surface of the analyzed water using a spark from the ignition coil, decompose it into a spectrum using a diffraction grating on top of the camera lens, fill it with <a href="http://spectralworkbench.org/">spectralworkbench.org</a> for calculation, do a signal and concentration calibration, PROFIT. <br><br><h6>  Atomic emission </h6><br>  There is a way to measure the content of sodium and potassium in liquid objects.  If you transfer the sample to steam at a temperature of a thousand to one and a half degrees Celsius, then sodium turns into a state of atomic vapor and begins to emit very intensively monochrome yellow light with a wavelength of 589 nm.  The intensity of radiation depends linearly on the sodium content in the sample, that is, you can measure several solutions with a known concentration and obtain the coefficients of this linear equation: <br>  I = a * c + b, where I is the intensity, c is the concentration. <br>  To obtain atomic vapor, sample injection into the flame of a gas burner is usually used; the device with all the giblets takes up a small cabinet.  Why not try replacing it all with a small spark generator? <br><br><h6>  Optics </h6><br>  Light can be decomposed into a spectrum with a prism or grating.  Intuition suggested that the grille is more convenient in operation, but just in case I ordered this and that from the Chinese.  There was no desire to make a lattice from the dividers.  At the same time, he glanced at the Spectral Workbench out of the corner of his eye.  Their paper spectroscope (shown on the CCDV) did not actually roll because of the very low aperture ratio.  But a ride just attach the grille to the lens.  It is absolutely not suitable for working in daylight, but our plasma turned out to be relatively pinpoint and in the dark. <br><br><h6>  Sparkler </h6><br>  Survive here from here: <a href="http://cxem.net/tesla/tesla27.php">cxem.net/tesla/tesla27.php</a> .  At first he tried to gather on the igniting trance from the flash, but clearly did not have enough power.  I put the Zhiguli coil, powered by 4x18650 and a little strapping to protect the field engineer and the microchip.  At the very first launch, the protection circuit exploded in the batteries, it was necessary to amputate.  Frequency about 500 Hz, a duty cycle of 60%.  The spark was about 7 mm in length, while the coil howls resonantly at a frequency of about 1.5 kHz, as I understand it because of all harmonics.  The scheme and implementation of nothing special is not: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c58/294/4d4/c582944d4b8e7a38df2ad7af61563fcb.gif"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/298/fd9/1e2/298fd91e2ba724ce1ef56dfa18a4e71a.jpg"><br>  One electrode dunk in the water, the second hangs 2-3 mm above the surface.  If you put a diffraction grating on the lens and set the shutter speed a little longer, you‚Äôll get the following spectacle: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/eff/47b/914/eff47b91490f21b28b858dd76d8ef618.jpg"><br>  And if you remove the background and leave only what you need, it will be like this: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d68/a21/1c9/d68a211c909cf19c2d767048bab0bef4.jpg"><br>  Sodium spectral line visible to the naked eye <br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/VIpKSPyVqOc%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700023,15700186,15700190,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhjdKda2CzqQVN8PoBgbrVVaaTc4Bg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  Video high speed camera, 1000 fps  Here are those dim flashes in the center - these are the digits <br><br><h6>  Payment </h6><br>  After calibration and uploading to the site, we have such a nice range: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/54f/dc5/7b7/54fdc57b7176934d3fb15d75625f74ca.png"><br>  The peak of sodium in its place, the difference is literally 1 nm.  Then everything is simple.  We measured several solutions with an exact concentration of sodium, obtained an equation, measured mineral water, and calculated the sodium content.  The results are similar to the truth, I will not give due to their absolute uselessness. <br><br><h5>  results </h5><br>  The work was successfully reported at the district stage.  The area is weak in itself, and there were only four members.  Of these, two were trained in my laboratory, and two more were school teachers.  My ward and another student went to the regional stage.  The report will be in mid-January.  During this time it is necessary to ideally prepare a report and answers to all sorts of provocative questions.  The matter is complicated by the fact that chemistry in the work is not so much as in competitors, in addition, it is necessary to teach not quite school physics and electronics.  Rubilovo will be the most powerful, there are many competitors and they are really strong.  Chances in my opinion sparsely, but you have to try.  For my first manual, the result is quite good so far.  For the future, it is necessary to kick schoolchildren more actively, otherwise they have an eternal desire to hang out.  But this is understandable. <br><br><h5>  Plans Plans </h5><br>  And a lot of them.  Almost all of them are peeped somewhere, but it is not very realistic to think up something absolutely from scratch, especially at the school level.  The list of possible topics has grown to two pages of text.  There are homemade semiconductors, a solar cell based on an organic dye, and a gas generator for an airbag.  But there are few schoolchildren who will master this at once, and there are almost no patients with allies who are ready to run into an absolutely unfamiliar topic.  But hope dies last.  Yes, and leadership in these matters at least does not interfere, even if there is some damage to the main work. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/206440/">https://habr.com/ru/post/206440/</a></p>
