  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Linux processes in Bash man</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Why is the head called "head off" and how is it related to the bash command shell?  But if you look closely, you will have a lot in common.  The processes that occur every second in our brain painfully resemble the screen of the top command - * nix utility, which dynamically displays the consumption of system resources. <br><br>  You are loaded with work and suddenly a new employee of the development department defiled past your desk.  The sleeping high-priority system daemon of backup DNA copying instantly captured almost all the resources, the current user process of working on the project was rejected as niceless into ‚Äúbeautifully far away‚Äù RAM and squeal plaintively offended ... With incredible efforts you manage to take control and return to work, justice is restored.  Whew! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/03f/897/ed7/03f897ed764e44fd9609bf74a2641154.jpg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  - Already two hours, it's time to eat lunch!  - the cron service worked.  The basic system process of energy recharging is activated and confidently begins to push apart and slow down other processes making their way up.  And here you interrupt work, get up and go to eat.

    <h2>  whoami? </h2><br>  <i>‚ÄúPharaoh turned to his seventy scribes, each of whom wrote down all the words of Pharaoh in one of the seventy languages ‚Äã‚Äãof the peoples of the world, and asked them:‚Äú Do you know about God, Who is called by this four-letter name? ‚Äù.</i>  <i>They replied: ‚ÄúWe have read all the books of all nations and know the names of all the gods.</i>  <i>But we never met this four-letter name. ‚Äù</i>  <i>The scribes answered the truth.</i>  <i>(The Book of Exodus)</i> <br><br>  How many processes are executed, starts the child processes, and dies every second in the human brain, and only a small part is controlled by us consciously.  If you think about it, then the person does not work from under the super-user, this assumption is naive.  It works as an ordinary user with the <i>sudo command</i> , with clearly defined rights in the <i>/ etc / sudoers</i> file, and very modest ones.  ( <i>How to check this? Team whoami or look at the console, if there is a dollar sign, you are definitely not under the root.</i> ) Only Indian yogis, at the cost of enormous effort, break into the system and get root access. <br><br>  It happens that some process is a pernicious addiction, it takes all the resources and puts the user on his knees.  And the unfortunate user calls out to the admin, but root is usually busy with more important matters ... <br><br><h2>  Permissions Denied: Workarounds </h2><br>  Now they write a lot about the fact that until the creation of a computer analogue of the human brain is still very, very far away, but at the same time we use all these resources?  An ordinary person is essentially a demon of consciousness running in the background on a local host or in a virtual machine. <br><br>  And all this is quite strange.  The program is easy to install, "carry" - the whole problem.  Take, for example, the usual dependence on tobacco: once we have done <i>yum install smoking,</i> we get a crontab entry with a 25 minute process call interval, and we need to seriously try to get rid of it, but it would seem: just comment out the line. <br><br>  Depression, fear, irritation - alas, we are not able to see the PID of the malware, but even if we knew it, we do not have rights to execute the kill command.  However, all is not lost, hack exists!  This is a hack of indirect action: it turns out there are mutually displacing processes, if one is active, the other goes into the sleeping state. <br><br>  Happy is the one who read the forbidden <i>man</i> and knows all the correspondences: fatigue is replaced by sleep, fear by laughter, etc.  Remember how a meeting at the meeting instantly discharged someone's resourceful joke.  At the beginning of the 2000s, I did not work for a long time with one muddy entrepreneur who acted with clients as quite a serious person, and in a non-business environment, from time to time he poisoned all sorts of tales and fabulous anecdotes, which apparently he himself invented.  Now I understand, I knew, I knew, the cunning Rustamitch knew this hack, constantly being in a state of fear for his dark deeds, and laughter helped him in his fight with him (but the Obovites finally came to him).  It is also the answer to the question why school teachers hate fun-loving ones - they destroy the atmosphere of fear, the favorite weapon of minded educators. <br><br>  And is it possible to clean the system on its own, ‚Äúkill‚Äù zombie processes in order to free up RAM and processor resources?  Yes, one of the ways to reboot is sports training.  I noticed that businessmen, as a rule, necessarily engage in some kind of sport: one loves tennis, the other goes to yoga, the third runs in the morning.  Apparently, with increasing physical exertion, the body independently launches a scavenger program, which ‚Äúkills‚Äù unnecessary parasitic processes and frees up system resources. <br><br><h2>  Diseases - as feedback </h2><br>  I hope that an augmented reality device like the ps or top command will someday be invented, and then many diseases will disappear.  After all, now various ailments - a kind of feedback between us and the body. <br><br>  For example, hypothermia causes the manifestation of the herpes virus.  If we take into account that herpes exists with a human for thousands of years - immunity should be developed for him a long time ago, but this does not happen, on the contrary, the infection of humanity with herpes approaches 100%. <br><br>  And what if this is a necessary program that signals that the body needs rest and simultaneously launches other, so far unknown processes?  And the treatment of herpes with acyclovir is nothing more than meaningless violence against a software module that prevents it from working normally? <br><br>  Now the subconscious has to invent sophisticated ways of interacting with the consciousness, and with monitoring we don‚Äôt have to play Field of Miracles, we will know in advance about the growing burden and take action. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/334950/">https://habr.com/ru/post/334950/</a></p>
