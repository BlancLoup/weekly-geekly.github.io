    <a name="habracut"></a>  11.00-13.00.  Somewhere around this time I come to the office. <br><br>  Yes, I sleep for a long time, and no matter how much I try to reverse this regime, it turns out badly.  Here it is not punished, as long as I carry out all the tasks on time.  My boss comes in at 10, the head of the team works from morning to night, but four days a week, because he has a family in Germany.  In general, everything is very flexible. <br><br>  So, I greet the team, have lunch, drink a cup of coffee.  Breakfast-lunch-dinners are free here.  They feed tasty and diverse: there is always fish, meat, some pasta and dessert.  And, most importantly - there is a machine for getting freshly squeezed orange juice. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/006/8ea/a3d/0068eaa3df9d293e42445be1addf5949.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  At 12.00 we have standup rally.  Dubious occupation, in my opinion, but the team is practicing.  All stand in a circle and briefly tell what they did, what did not work and what are their plans for the future.  I usually skip it.  However, nothing terrible, since my project is not yet tied to anyone except me. <br><br>  By the way, about my project - as usual details are closed NDA, but in the most general words.  I work in team X, which makes product Y, which is then used by team Z. Neither X nor Y do not google, but in general we are talking about tons of data, lots of computers, thousands of lines of code.  I have a rather interesting project.  Now I am adding some functionality for Y, and then I will mercilessly optimize it.  At the same time pick up Java.  After C ++ it goes like clockwork. <br><br>  Then I immerse myself in coding, sometimes communicating with my boss, it lasts up to 8-9 hours. <br><br>  It looks like this: <br><br><img src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_iRVn0TqOQyA/R86htFQoyXI/AAAAAAAAAXg/Er4X1RvYmdo/s720/206_F4_office.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The workplace is very convenient - two monitors, even more than MS, Linux, Eclipse.  Know - work. <br>  By the way, about the process of work.  At first, I was worried that I would have to write in an unfamiliar language, master the local infrastructure, but it didn‚Äôt seem to cause any particular problems.  The problems were different - the lack of industrial experience affects and as a result I sometimes incorrectly prioritize.  For example, once I spent a whole week studying and applying some internal data structure (written, by the way, by one of the former ASM researchers).  For a long time I could not understand how it works, until I realized that I taught the same to my schoolchildren in Kungur.  But that's not the point.  After I felt the internal structure, I realized that I could strain a little and speed up some process 5-10 times, and reduce the amount of memory spent by 2 times, due to the use of implementation features.  If, after reading this sentence, you have a shine in your eyes, then you probably once actively engaged in AFM.  I spent a few days, implemented and it even __ worked.  And suddenly, on the weekend, I realized that I spent my time absolutely in vain, because: <br><br>  1) my system is not real-time, and there‚Äôs no sense that it works a minute, not a second <br>  2) the implementation was much more complicated than in the obvious method <br>  3) the main thing is that the solution was based on the use of an internal representation, instead of a public interface, which means that when the internals change, I will have to change my piece of code <br><br>  In general, it is not so easy to get used to the fact that speed and optimality are needed only as long as some functionality is impossible without them.  What can be spent a couple of days on refactoring the code, which already works fine, but we will divide the piece A into two pieces B and C, which are much more convenient to work with, and so on.  I learn a lot here and it's great. <br><br>  I really like the team I work with.  It seems that almost everyone here is with a PhD, and the Ukrainian Bogdan, although he did not have time to get it, but the finalist is ASM.  Moreover, I walked across the floor somehow, and, after reading the posted questionnaires, I found out that almost half came from Research, many of them had the same PhD.  It depends on the team, I think, but still the qualitative composition is quite strong. <br><br>  Before you code it, you need to show it to your colleagues.  My first piece of code for 700 lines was recently cruelly otveveven my boss, 95% of the comments belonged to the style, but I have been doing the remaining 5% for a week now.  However, another week, and it will be possible to safely deliver, on which the first, smaller part of my project will be completed.  :) <br><br>  After work, I go to the first floor to the gym <br><br><img src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_iRVn0TqOQyA/R86k11Qoy3I/AAAAAAAAAbk/k-Q-ZB0TthU/s640/076_F0_gym.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  20 minutes of running, weight training equipment, press 100 times, beating a pear, a shower.  Who said that a programmer is a snag with glasses? <br><br>  After the gym is very cool to lie in the room with aquariums <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/5d4/f93/b11/5d4f93b113c0a78cc81cef4f5cee1a80.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  And then I go to the Play room and do the piano for an hour.  Of course, not a pink piano, as in MS, but also amiss. <br><br>  Sometimes you really want to call home, for this you can use the following booths <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/65a/fc6/6fd/65afc66fdbc787154870c87614dab25a.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  It is midnight, I walk out of the building and in half an hour on foot I reach my apartment, where only a sofa is out of furniture, but, by the way, this is more than enough for me.  And everything repeats. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/90301/">https://habr.com/ru/post/90301/</a></p>
