We are glad to welcome all visitors of Habr! <br><br>  Not so long ago, we, specialists at iTrit, worked in fairly large companies.  They have come a long way from IT administrators to IT managers, and solved tasks of varying degrees of complexity.  But once we were tired of working for the ‚Äúuncle‚Äù, and we decided that we had to go our own way.  We chose IT outsourcing.  This is how iTrit appeared. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  The main activity of the company is the provision of quality IT outsourcing services for the maintenance of IT infrastructure in the SMB segment.

      There are a great many companies on the market that provide such services.  What distinguishes us from all the others: <ul><li>  We are guided by the rule - IT for business, not business for IT.  It often happens that IT serves as a burden and is not a tool for solving business problems and optimizing business processes. </li><li>  Providing services of both full and partial IT outsourcing, when only the most problematic areas of IT infrastructure are outsourced. </li><li>  We use modern effective IT management methods, apply knowledge of ITIL / ITSM, which allows us to optimize our own resources and most effectively solve the problems of our customers, and our customers understand what they pay for. </li><li>  There are no restrictions on departures and applications.  The client determines the criticality of the service and the maximum downtime (SLA). </li><li>  The lion's share of work is performed remotely.  Fast, high quality, safe.  Departures are made as needed. </li><li>  We suggest using hardware from reputable manufacturers.  At the same time you get a number of advantages: <br>  - Warranty and Technical support from the manufacturer <br>  - Confident compatibility with software platforms (Microsoft, Linux, FreeBSD) <br>  - Brand servers offer greater flexibility in server management <br>  - As a rule, branded servers are more reliable in operation <br>  All this will reduce costs and reduce service downtime in the event of a breakdown or failure. </li><li>  We offer the possibility of using free software (Linux, FreeBSD) in some business tasks. </li><li>  In our activities in building local networks, we propose to use time-tested, reliable Cisco network devices.  We also work with other devices, but, as practice shows, after we install a Cisco client, some issues with the functioning of the network infrastructure simply disappear. </li></ul><br>  All this allows us to provide quality services to our customers. <br><br>  Concerning the cost of services: <br>  The client is offered a flexible scheme for calculating the cost of services based on the needs of the client, the number and specificity of services, equipment and software. <br>  The exact cost can be determined after the express audit of the client's IT infrastructure.  Express auditing is free. <br>  We also have a free consultation. <br>  We do not work with everyone, we work with those who value their time, understand the importance and necessity of IT for their business. <br><br>  We are far from perfect, but we try to be them.  Our company is located in St. Petersburg. <br>  In our blog, we will describe interesting moments from the life of the company and cover interesting technical notes. <br>  Good luck to you and your customers. <br>  Company website: <a href="http://itrit.ru/">itrit.ru</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/110845/">https://habr.com/ru/post/110845/</a></p>
