  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Why America merges Ukraine Russia</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Even before the elections in Ukraine, it became clear that there would be two, a maximum of three candidates for the presidency, among whom there is no current president, an ardent russophobe and pro-Westerner, Yushchenko.  Even then, Yushchenko‚Äôs behavior seemed a mystery to me.  All the same, it was obvious that in a country where the majority in another language other than Russian do not communicate, where a large part of the population are Russians, such a policy is political suicide.  But all this could have been attributed to the inadequacy of Yushchenko, although it still remains incomprehensible where his American wife is looking.  Anyway, Yushchenko, as expected under such a policy, is a political corpse.  But there is still Tymoshenko, another representative of the Orange revolutionaries.  If Yushchenko got out of control of Western bosses, and committed political suicide voluntarily, then it seemed necessary to rely on the orange princess.  But‚Ä¶ <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <i><b>Ukrainians were shown a documentary about theft of the US Tymoshenko</b></i> <i><br></i>  <i>News - Politics</i> <i><br></i>  <i>KIEV, January 15th.</i>  <i>On the eve of the presidential elections in Ukraine, the ‚Äúgas past‚Äù of the current prime minister, presidential candidate Yulia Tymoshenko, re-emerged.</i>  <i>According to Segodnya, a presentation of the documentary film ‚ÄúStolen Popcorn‚Äù by the American director Brett Alain was held in Kiev.</i>  <i>The main "heroes" of the film are two Ukrainian prime ministers.</i>  <i>The former - Pavel Lazarenko, convicted in the United States for financial fraud, and the current one - Tymoshenko, who was once very close to him.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>The film tells about the fraudulent schemes used by Lazarenko, and about the involvement of Yulia Tymoshenko.</i>  <i>American state prosecutor Martha Borsch from the screen directly says that Tymoshenko is a close ally of Lazarenko and an accomplice of his shadow schemes.</i> <i>

Yes, Yulia is <a href="http://www.rosbalt.ru/2010/01/17/704459.html">assisted by image-makers working in the Obama team, but American professionals</a> from McCain's headquarters also <a href="http://www.rosbalt.ru/2010/01/17/704459.html">work with Yanukovych</a> . <br><br>  Americans seem to be completely turned off from the struggle for Ukraine.  Rare interviews in the American media have virtually no orange color, for example, it was surprising to read <a href="http://www.inosmi.ru/ukraine/20100116/157610488.html">such a weighted interview with Yanukovych</a> .  There are other publications that make a kind of weighted analysis, and Yanukovych is no longer seen as an indisputable Kremlin candidate.  It is no longer pouring mud tubs, like 5 years ago. <br><br>  But the outcome of the elections is not predetermined.  It would seem that in such a situation, when the Americans turned off the struggle, and even help us (all the same, Yanukovych is the most acceptable option for us, albeit not ideal), a sin not to incline the scales in our favor.  But Russia, such a feeling arises, turned off from the struggle, like America, and is watching everything from the outside.  Moreover, Tymoshenko raises its rating, including through the successful resolution of gas issues.  Putin said that Russia would not penalize Ukraine for not supplying gas, gas negotiations ended fairly easily this year, Yulia defiantly laughs at Putin‚Äôs joke about Saakashvili‚Äôs tie when his godfather visited Yushchenko.  All this adds her whist.  But still, these gestures cannot be called unequivocal support of the candidate, they are more like gestures of goodwill, an attempt to show that Russia does not interfere in the process. <br><br>  But why not intervene?  We do not need our ships in the Crimea?  We are no longer concerned about the supply of arms to Ukraine by Georgia?  Tymoshenko unequivocally declares support for Saakashvili and the "territorial integrity of Georgia."  Already for this alone it would be possible to fight for Yanukovich.  And why do Americans rivet dirt on the ‚Äúorange princess‚Äù rather than on the ‚ÄúKremlin candidate‚Äù? <br><br>  <i><b>Yushchenko: Ukraine paid for gas for the first time at the expense of NBU currency reserves - ‚Äúthis is a tragedy‚Äù</b></i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>If Ukraine will continue to pay for gas from national currency reserves, then in six months it will be possible to declare it bankrupt</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i><a href="http://www.novoteka.ru/seventexp/6817916/16498038">www.novoteka.ru/seventexp/6817916/16498038</a></i> <br><br>  What is pay for gas from gold reserves?  This is the first step to default.  How is the gold reserves of any state?  Usually, if there is no permanent source of export dollars, like in Ukraine, all the money held in the gold reserves is borrowed money from Ukrainian companies.  The company borrows in dollars and changes them to the national currency of the National Bank.  The bank issues emissions and deposits the currency in foreign bank accounts.  When it is time to return the loan, the company performs the reverse operation.  What will happen if the national bank does not have money?  This is the default!  Especially if the IMF does not provide loans. <br><br>  <i><b>Ukraine is in last place in Europe in terms of wages</b></i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>At the end of October, Ukraine fell to the last place in wages in Europe in dollar terms.</i>  <i>At the same time, the price level in our country is comparable to the price level in other poorest countries of Europe, and even higher in some categories (for example, housing).</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i><a href="http://www.recruiting.net.ua/archive/37-article/3027-2009-12-22-13-07-56.html">www.recruiting.net.ua/archive/37-article/3027-2009-12-22-13-07-56.html</a></i> <br><br>  What the Americans did.  This is genius!  They drove Ukraine into debt, destroyed, by the hands of the Orange revolutionaries, the economy, and now they are giving Ukraine back to us.  Fine!  Now we, if we do not help the brotherly people, will lose Ukraine forever.  Even those who are loyal to Russia will be offended and will turn away from Russia forever.  Now many people understand that the ‚Äúcivilized world‚Äù does not need Ukraine.  What a blow would be for them if it turns out that Ukraine does not need Russia too?  They will turn to the West again, because if it turns out that Ukraine is not needed by anyone, and no one is going to feed her, they will start to outweigh other moments, <a href="http://www.projectrussia.info/blogs/621/">such as freedom, democracy, freedom of speech and other ‚Äúlight bulbs of academic Pavlov‚Äù</a> .  The more the dog is hungry, the more it attracts the light bulb.  She has no other choice. <br><br>  If the default had happened before, before the election, it would be easier.  The whole burden of responsibility would fall on an orange couple - Yushchenko and Tymoshenko.  And at the same time to the west, which did not help Ukraine.  That is why the IMF so regularly allocated loans.  The goal was to hold Ukraine in any way before the elections, and then throw it off as a patient, who lived only on tablets, for the treatment of Russia.  In a state when artificially pushed into the disease, has already entered an irreversible stage.  And when it became clear that Ukraine reached the elections, the <a href="http://www.grani.ru/Politics/World/Europe/Ukraine/m.172528.html">IMF refuses the last tranche of the loan</a> . <br><br>  Russia finds itself in a difficult situation.  It is difficult for us to take Ukraine ‚Äúon balance‚Äù, the fat years are over, and to help the undoubtedly fraternal country, in the current situation, is more precious to us.  More expensive also because the fellow citizens will be indignant.  The problems themselves are enough, but also another state to help.  Russia turns out to be between two fires, on the one hand, let's say we default, Ukraine will be lost for us for a long time, because the West did not allow it, and regularly fed from the hands of the IMF.  And who will understand there that the IMF loans are voluntary bondage.  Can Russia alone support Ukraine in the same volumes?  These are tens of billions of dollars, by the way.  Maybe, but in so doing we will aggravate our internal problems, destabilize the situation in society, the authorities will expose their own authority to the blow. <br><br>  That is why Putin flirts with Tymoshenko, which is why Russia does not help Yanukovych.  Open support Tymoshenko, we can not.  It will look very strange, and how will we help her, how?  How do we explain to the people of Sevastopol that they now have to vote for the orange lady, who claims that the presence of the Russian fleet in the Crimea contradicts the constitution of Ukraine?  They will regard it as a betrayal, and they will be right.  It remains only to hope that Tymoshenko will win by herself.  Yes, like this.  In our interests, the victory of Tymoshenko.  For then the inevitable default of Ukraine will be the final blow to the pro-Western politicians of the Square, and Russia will have the right not to help Ukraine until the orange is at the helm.  And no one will throw a stone at our side. <br><br>  But, unfortunately, the chances of such an outcome are few.  West for 5 years, carefully and gently, with a clear and alignment made from Ukraine a ball for bowling.  And now it is time to throw him into Russia.  And we can only wait, fall or not.  And such experienced players rarely miss. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/81218/">https://habr.com/ru/post/81218/</a></p>
