But I almost didn‚Äôt see any material on what it means to be subordinate.  I saw models: ‚Äúlet the boss give me freedom, and then I will definitely achieve the result, and now I‚Äôm alone in control‚Äù, ‚Äúthe world is the world: the boss is always right, my job is to be silent in a rag‚Äù. <br><br>  I myself work as a lead programmer, lead a group of programmers. <br><br>  In this article I want to talk about my experience in the company - how, in my opinion, you need to communicate with the manager so that the work is pleasant, there are no unpleasant unpleasant questions, there is a feeling of understanding with the manager.

      It is worth noting that leaders are different, and these principles may not work somewhere.  But, as my experience of 2.5 years in a large company shows, the experience of other people, as well as analytics from executive books, which talk about successful employees (the best of the best) and their qualities, have a lot in common. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h3>  1. Communication - the key to success </h3><br><blockquote>  ‚ÄúA person‚Äôs financial success in life is 80% determined by his communication skills and 20% professional skills‚Äù <br>  According to the study of the fund to them.  Carnegie </blockquote><br>  As a rule, the goal of the leader is the effective work of his unit.  Effective work can not be without reliable information from subordinates.  Therefore, I try to always talk about all the problems that concern me.  It is worth saying that this is exactly the problem, not the short-term issues that you can solve yourself. <br><ul><li>  Set unrealistic deadlines - explain why unrealistic, offer an alternative. </li><li>  You have domestic problems - do not write after the fact, when you were not half a day at an important moment and you were run over, unsubscribe in advance, or at the time of occurrence. </li><li>  You do not break / depression.  Take a day off, or share your problem with the manager - it can help you decide, in any case, listen and know why you are screwing the layout for three days. </li></ul><br>  Therefore: <strong>talk about your problems, do not hesitate</strong> <br><br><br><h3>  2. The percentage of converting words into the case </h3><br>  My manager has this criterion for evaluating people.  How many of the above people translate into action. <br><br>  The realities of our world are such that those who promise to get stars from the sky are millions, only, as a rule, no one from the sky is enough.  Therefore, the best way to make yourself known is to turn everything said into what has been done.  In this case, again, those who begin to do and throws - thousands.  The ability to bring each task to the end will dramatically push you forward. <br><br>  Another tricky moment: do not forget about the first part of this statement.  Sometimes it makes sense to just talk less and not create false expectations, and if even talk about the tasks already done.  Good practice too. <br>  Therefore: the <strong>words are cheap - the road works</strong> <br><br><br><h3>  3. Work conscientiously </h3><br>  There are quite a few people working with a neutral attitude.  And there are not so many who make even a trifle with inspiration, creative zeal, putting the soul.  Here you can hear opinions from the theory of "after / if."  "If they give me an interesting task," "after I have been recognized by all." <br><br>  The realities are such that you will never achieve more if you do not prove that you are doing everything in the current situation with the highest quality and your opportunities have grown. <br><br>  For example, after completing the task, test the bugs, identify yourself, act not formally, but conscientiously, qualitatively, write the code with comments right away, comment on all the commits - then it will be pleasant to yourself.  Behind this there is no need to lose the essence - effectiveness. <br>  Therefore: <strong>one thing on the conscience is better than ten anyhow</strong> <br><br><br><h3>  4. Helping a manager is helping yourself. </h3><br>  The head also has questions that need to be addressed.  Even the company faces such questions.  The better you understand where the company is moving, the better you will know the tasks of your manager. <br><br>  As a rule, the head is loaded above the roof, and there is usually no help waiting.  Therefore, an initiative employee who is able to understand the problems of a manager is a very good sign of the degree of your interest in work and in the success of your department.  There is no need, however, to push, and you need to be really ready to solve problems not to the detriment of your tasks. <br><br>  The head, seeing it, will definitely mark it.  And as he moves up, he will take with him precisely those who best understand him and worked with him. <br>  Therefore: <strong>help to the head is investing in your future</strong> <br><br><br><h3>  5. Respect </h3><br>  A leader is a person who does a lot.  In addition to his tasks, he is responsible for the work of all his subordinates together, and each one individually.  This is a very important and difficult job.  You need to be able to respect the work of others - today it is not so common.  Respect helps to build good long-term relationships, to solve work issues fruitfully. <br>  Therefore: <strong>respect and be respected</strong> <br><br><br><h3>  6. The importance of the initiative </h3><br>  There is a fear effect of the first step.  When everyone is ready for the exam and you have to take a ticket, an awkward wait arises - everyone is afraid of being the first.  Therefore, someone destroys uncertainty and takes the first step, followed by everyone else. <br><br>  In the work there are often such a hitch.  It must be remembered that luck loves the brave, and take responsibility for the first step.  This will improve the work of the team as a whole, and get yourself a plus in karma. <br><br>  In addition, there are always so-called "important, but non-urgent tasks."  Knowing them, and learning to cope with your work in a shorter time, you can no longer wait for new tasks for growth from a manager, but take steps (by coordinating the initiative) for exactly these tasks.  It will also move your department and the company as a whole forward, and will not slow down to reflect on your assessment as a specialist. <br>  Therefore: <strong>grow on your own initiative</strong> <br><br><br><h3>  7. Teamwork </h3><br>  Much depends on the relationship in the team.  If you learn how to build a climate in a team, build bridges between team members and even between employees from different departments - you will also take some of the work of the manager on your shoulders and make his life easier - and improve yours. <br>  Therefore: <strong>work not <i>in a team</i> , but <i>with a team</i></strong> <br><br><br><h3>  How did this affect my work </h3><br>  I came to work in the web department as a simple programmer.  Grew to the head of the group.  In the process of communicating with my supervisor, I received and receive an invaluable exchange of experience, knowledge, and I have the opportunity to receive excellent advice.  On his own initiative, he developed a number of utilities for automating and facilitating the activities of webmasters. <br><br>  He continued to get involved in automation.  Now - headed the company automation group. <br><br></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/83277/">https://habr.com/ru/post/83277/</a></p>
