Conditions, requirements and other procedural procedures are well written <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/230503/">here</a> .  I will try not to repeat myself, but to share practical advice that helped me and my three comrades to become fellows of the program.  Moreover, people who are interested in enrolling in the United States can already begin to collect documents. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  Briefly about the main thing </h2><br>  First of all, you need to write a <b>Personal Statement</b> (motivation letter, where you are trying to prove why you should become a fellow), <b>Study Objective</b> (a letter in which you focus on the scientific side of your activity: describe the project you want to do in the States, its relevance and perspective) and <b>three letters of recommendation</b> .  This is the main package of documents on the basis of which the primary selection of candidates takes place. <br><br>  The next stage is an interview, where a group of people from completely different directions (besides 1-2 IT specialists, there may be historians, archeologists, biologists) will try to understand why they should choose you, how the USA will help you in solving your problems and what real Your project will benefit our society or humanity as a whole. <br><br>  In fact, if you have been interviewed, you are considered a Fulbright finalist (I mean the winner).  This means that you have already been allocated money, it remains only to pass exams at the level that is necessary for entering a university.  Of the exams will have to pass the TOEFL and GRE.

      By the way, this year initially there were only 600 applicants in the Ukrainian office of Fulbright (in my opinion, this is very little).  Of these, 90 people were selected for an interview, of which 25 became winners.  Not such a big competition as for a program that is one of the most prestigious academic programs in the world.  In Russia, the ratio of the number of people in place is approximately the same. <br><br><h2>  But first things first </h2><br>  As you can see, the greatest number of people is eliminated at the first stage.  This means that writing essays and letters of recommendation should be approached as seriously as possible. <br><br><ul><li>  <b>Layfak 1.</b> A letter of recommendation from a former <b>Fulbriet member</b> is plus 100 to karma in the eyes of the person who will monitor your application.  I did not have it, but, nevertheless, if you manage to get one, your chances are rapidly increasing.  If you do not have such contacts, do not despair, the next item is for you. </li><li>  <b>Layfak 2. Carefully</b> understand the difference between the Personal Statement and Study Objective.  It is these 2 documents that play the largest role in your ‚Äúintroductory campaign‚Äù at the moment. </li></ul><br>  <b>1. In a good personal statement reveals your life path.</b> <br><br>  Tell us about what life and academic goals you have achieved at the moment, how your education and interests helped you in solving your problems, why you came to this area, how your work experience helps you to improve in this industry (in your case - IT industry) were there any people who had a special influence on you who they are?  In general, demonstrate that receiving a grant is not a gift, but the result of many years of work. <br>  You can add some background information that sets you apart from other applicants. <br>  Do you like to run? <br>  - Hello, tell me how jogging helps you relax, concentrate, achieve your goals, etc. <br>  Embroider cross? <br>  - I'd rather run, but also go. <br><br>  <b>2. In a good personal statement, your expectations from a trip to the USA should be indicated.</b> <br><br>  How training in America will help you realize your scientific potential, why in Russia / Ukraine you cannot get the same knowledge (weak material and technical base, outdated training materials, etc., etc., emphasis on theory, not on practice, etc. . etc.).  And how do you plan to develop further. <br><br><ul><li>  <b>Layfak 3.</b> You can indicate that you plan to subsequently receive a PhD.  This will highlight the seriousness of your intentions. </li></ul><br>  <b>3. In a good Personal Statement there should be a brief description of your project, its relevance, which is necessary for a successful completion.</b> <br><br>  <b>Study Objective</b> focuses on two things: <br>  <b>1. What do you want to study in the USA?</b> <br>  a) be specific when talking about your specialty and field of interest <br>  b) specify the specific things you want to master <br>  <b>2. Why do you want to study it?</b> <br>  a) explain how this degree is intertwined with your life experience and achievements <br>  b) explain how this degree will help you achieve your life and academic goals <br><br>  In general, it is necessary to emphasize here that you have a specific plan for studying in the States, including attending specific courses.  A plus would be the mention of certain scientists, professors who work in your field, and with whom you would be interested to cross. <br><br>  Also note that education in America will not only give you access to libraries, professors, but also immerse yourself in foreign culture and meet new people.  Fulbright is not just a student exchange program for scientific reasons.  First of all, it is a cultural exchange that helps to establish relationships with people of different faiths, color and radically different convictions.  Many people overlook this and lose their "points" in the eyes of inspectors. <br><br><h3>  Interview </h3><br>  If you are serious about the process, then the chances that you will be invited to an interview are quite large.  Do not forget to put on a suit, a friendly smile and hit the road.  The beauty of the interview is that no one is trying to overwhelm you.  Once you leave the bright and spacious room, you have passed or not understand, you probably will not succeed.  The atmosphere is extremely friendly, everyone is happy and happy.  As a rule, you should be prepared for such questions: <br><br>  - Why would you like to study in the USA? <br>  - What exactly would you like to teach there? <br>  - Do you know that this program is also a cultural exchange?  Can you adequately represent your country? <br>  - Do you have certain preferences in uni, programs, courses? <br>  - How will this trip affect your life? <br><br>  If you carefully read the previous section, you probably noticed that you had already answered these questions in your Study Objectives and Personal Statement.  Interviewers want to make sure that you: <br><br>  a) you have no problems with communication; <br>  b) you read your letter of motivation; <br>  c) you are really ‚Äúin the subject line‚Äù and you know what you are talking about (if the biologist among you is not lousy, you should not apply for biology). <br><br><ul><li>  <b>Layfak 4. Dazzle</b> in the eyes significantly increases your chances.  If you can not tell about your ideas so that people want to help you in the realization of your dreams, it will be difficult to pass. </li></ul><br>  And immediately after him: <br><br><ul><li>  <b>Layfak 5.</b> The better you write your essays, the more interesting points you can reveal in them, the easier it will be for you to pass the interview.  I wrote a lot about my hobbies, diploma and 90% of the questions related either to clarifying what was written, or asking me to tell more about your ‚Äúcrazy experience‚Äù </li></ul><br><br>  Don't forget the smile.  Be friendly!  In the country in which you are going to go, so it is accepted. <br><br>  PS The most difficult thing behind.  You need to pass TOEFL ibt + GRE.  I could describe in more detail about the preparation for these exams, but perhaps this is not exactly the format of Habr. <br><br>  Documents are accepted until May 15-16 each year. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/242087/">https://habr.com/ru/post/242087/</a></p>
