    <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  It will be no secret to anyone that degenerates in large and medium-sized companies are quite common, or rather, “bloom with a double color”.  Visually, the degenerate corporate view (we combine them under this name) evolved from the following basic types: <br><ul><li>  The boss / boss is a person who created a company at the time, but has ceased to follow things, to delve into the inner life.  A competent manager will shift his duties to the deputies \ povom \ managers and they will perform their duties, the illiterate - just shift.  This type of unconsciously generates the following type of corporate degenerates.  <b>Strong degenerate</b> . </li><li>  the small / medium manager is a creature who has fallen out into the “upper” echelons of power as a result of soft priests and soft language.  <b>Narrow-minded degenerate</b> .  Not the fact that this miscarriage can jump somewhere above the current bar, not everyone needs soft tongues and supple buttocks.  But they take a very serious look at their corporate “purity”.  To the subordinate, who imagines to doubt any qualities of a narrow degenerate, all punishments from heaven, earth, and those that have not yet invented, threaten. </li><li>  Employees of degenerates are <b>small suckers</b> , which have not yet been finalized or are awaiting their time, for the implementation of their next worthless undertaking: the transition to small / medium-sized managers, with the aim of feeding additional fat. </li></ul><br><br>  The degenerate, in its essence, is asexual being - “it”, no matter who it is in the life of a woman or a man, when it becomes a degenerate, sex differences disappear.  Perhaps it is in life and is not a complete asshole and a freak, and communicate with him is quite nice.  Only it is necessary to leave these snot for privacy, here - production, work, and not a gay club - “blow the person below and push the buttocks ahead of the one in front”. <br><br><h5>  Identify degenerates. </h5><br><br>  There are several well-established ways to identify corporate degenerates, according to characteristic features: <br><ul><li>  “He is always the smartest \ read \ educated”, despite the fact that he reads only shit forums, coupled with a cosmopolitan, and read a single technical book already in the first year of a food-food vocational school. </li><li>  “He is always right,” even if wrong (s).  He never makes mistakes in work, because in his “infinite sphere”, he is, if not the Lord God, then Steve Jobs is 100%. </li><li>  “This is done by me!”.  To assign for him the results of someone's activity is a trifling matter.  After all, only he can carry out such a competent movement in jo in a competent direction of activity.  And you are my dear reader, and what about you?  You are a good specialist, you will be stroked on the head, tackled by the cheek.  At best, they will suck on the lollipop.  And that's all;  what did you expect?  World recognition, respect and girl from PlayBoy? </li><li>  “My knowledge is endless.”  Well, yes, well, of course, where without it.  It is just as simple as 2 kopecks and results from its “higher education” and the first paragraph. </li><li>  "Power and money."  The sequential combination of these two words may vary, depending on the location of the stars, monthly or PMS.  When it comes to these two points, a corporate degenerate can even rape a goat, in such postures for which the inhabitants of Sodom and Gamora lacked imagination.  Only more often does he run to the pharmacy across the road to buy Vaseline to maintain “active-friendly” relations with the authorities who nurtured him. </li><li>  “Bulldog mode. (Spattering saliva)”.  Woe to the "lower" creation that does not meet its goals.  “It” will sprinkle with saliva, stomp legs, like a child who did not give candy, although he had already eaten a couple of kilograms.  It is worth noting an important detail that the greater the level of degradation, the stronger the “tramp”, but “it” will not talk to you “directly”, looking into the eyes;  It will prefer you to send a nasty little letter to the e-mail \ icq, but it will not be able to talk to you, explaining the full extent of your downfall and “it”. </li><li>  “IBD (Simulator of stormy activity)” - separately this sign cannot be seen in nature, only together with one of the six listed above.  Posuti is a stormy activity out of nothing and for nothing, when a dog has nothing to do, it licks its loins.  When the degenerate has nothing to do, and the forums are re-read, it is worthwhile to strain someone with work: you need to work at work, and nothing else.  Quite often this situation occurs: today you need to fill in some documents, tomorrow others, the day after tomorrow some more.  About the first, everything is already forgotten.  We “develop” further!  You can not “trample” on the spot.  This farce is intended only for one thing - to show the higher authorities that “it” does something and eats its bread for good reason. </li></ul><br><br><h5>  Harm brought by degenerates. </h5><br><br>  Harm produced by degenerates is quite substantial for a company, and only at first glance does it seem that some work is being done and something is “being done”.  First of all, as a highly developed creature, it knows how to “optimize” and conduct any “kosher” process.  It is completely unimportant if “insignificant” stages are “thrown out of the technological process”, but this will lead to “productivity”.  It will draw an extra piece of paper and once again drool affection.  Is this not the highest happiness, my dear reader ?!  However, our degenerate will not calm down on this, he will strongly hint that you are not working well, while trying to make you work overtime, unplanned.  If there was an opportunity, you would be forced to drag a cot and work 25 hours a day, 7 days a week.  Someone surprised that in the day 25 hours?  Nothing, just need to get up on one, just one hour earlier.  As a result of such actions, the health of subordinates will be undermined, productivity will increase, only the growth of such productivity will be with a minus sign.  And of course “it” so passionately loves various reports.  It does not matter that the books report that the developer, distracted from work, will be able to return to it in normal mode after at least 30 minutes.  30 minutes on the report + 30 minutes on the return to work + 30 minutes on some more incoherent report of the total company is missing 90 minutes (or an hour and a half) of your working time, my reader.  From such “dances” everybody loses. <br>  It is worth drawing the line because  The damage caused by degenerates can be counted by the volumes of the Great Soviet Encyclopedia.  I can only say one thing: the main goal is to bring into the work as much confusion as possible, as much chaos as possible, to destabilize the work of the whole company as much as possible.  Harm can be enormous. <br><br><h5>  Ways to combat degenerates (moral). </h5><br><br>  The degenerate does not like “open” conversations, it believes that in this way “power and authority are lost to the workers”.  Based on this, you can: <br><ul><li>  Ignore his "messagi" (do not waste your time on empty and worthless "chatter").  On the next e-mail, you can add a higher manager to the copy (if he is not aware of all this orgy), with a question from the category: “Does it really need it?”. </li><li>  Go to work “step forward” if you really care about this work.  Thus, you can put it “at a standstill”.  It is worth noting that this is a rather slippery and difficult way.  Very often it will not work to use it. </li><li>  Try to discredit him in the face of his superiors, showing you how good you are, and “it” is a schmuck. </li><li>  Throw on the table a letter of withdrawal.  Purely pragmatic approach.  If nothing else can be “squeezed out” of work, why waste time? </li></ul><br><br>  You can offer a whole range of methods, but in most cases it is worthwhile to act according to circumstances, and they, sometimes, change with a catastrophic speed.  Therefore, we read together Sun Tzu, Arthashastra, Machiavelli and all that concerns war, control and conflict. <br><br>  And do not forget that only development will save you, my dear reader, from a degenerative fall.  Do not be like the weakest of this world. <br><br>  The following sections will discuss ways of dealing with degenerates in a technical “cut”. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/98047/">https://habr.com/ru/post/98047/</a></p>
