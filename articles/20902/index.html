I think most of us know what Russia Post represents today.  But, nevertheless, I want to tell you about the mail (and letters) a few things that may be useful. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h1>  1. Reporting?  By mail! </h1><br>  Today, one of the most relevant moments for many who are engaged in business is reporting.  We all would like to take it in advance and be very responsible, however, this is not always the case.  And in the host of the reporting authority (whether it is a tax inspectorate or a pension fund) - the queue. <br><br>  No need to waste your time.  Everything you need to pass there can be easily sent by mail.  In this case, I note, the date of delivery will be the date of departure.  And when your letter reaches the instance you should not worry.  You do your duty. <br><br>  In addition, today, for example, in the Pension Fund, you need to submit a part of the reporting in electronic form (that is, bring it with you on a diskette).  Feel free to put on it, because the law is not established.  The exceptions are those enterprises where the average number of employees exceeds 100 people.  Such enterprises are required to submit reports in electronic form, but only to the tax office.

    <h1>  2. Refuse to take?  By mail! </h1><br>  It often happens that you refuse to accept any papers, citing their refusal only orally.  In this case, you can send documents to the abuser by mail.  At the same time, if you have fulfilled the requirements specified in the law (for example, all the necessary documents have been sent) you simply cannot be denied.  And if they refuse, then boldly go to court.  You have evidence.  (see also item 6, about what letters are). <br><br><h1>  3. Need a notification?  By mail! </h1><br>  In the e-mail there is a notification that the addressee has opened the letter.  True, he may not send it.  There is also a notification from the mail server that the letter has been delivered to the mailbox, though it‚Äôs possible to get out of it. <br><br>  Paper mail notification is inevitable if it is.  You will receive back a piece of paper with proof that the addressee received the same letter.  And the addressee will not be able to avoid this. <br><br><h1>  4. Copyright?  By mail! </h1><br>  It seems strange to send a letter to yourself?  But no.  A registered letter is sent with a sealing envelope.  Believe me, sealing there is such that without breaking it it is difficult to get to the letter. <br><br>  As a result, if you send to yourself the fruits of your imperishable intellectual work by writing a list of investments, you will have unbreakable proof of the time when your work was born, because the letter will show the date of dispatch.  Then, before the trial you need to keep the envelope unopened. <br><br>  For those who are associated with Web design, it will not be superfluous to assure a printout of the appearance of the site at the notary (of course, putting it on the network).  Dual reliability. <br><br><h1>  5. Um, values?  By mail! </h1><br>  You will not believe, but the mail is ready to send quite valuable things.  Rather, those that can be estimated in juicy rubles.  Sending money by mail is somewhat silly (and forbidden, by the way), but securities are completely.  If the letter is valuable (and you set the value yourself), then if you lose the letter, you will be reimbursed for its value.  True, nothing is free - you will pay 3% of the declared value for this responsibility for sending a letter. <br><br>  But!  In case of loss, the cost is refundable in full. <br><br><h1>  6. Types of letters (and for what what is suitable) </h1><br><h2>  1. Simple letter </h2><br>  Great just to write "to the village of the grandfather."  It is worth little (6 rubles 50 kopecks) and usually reaches the addressee.  However, you may get lost, you know. <br><br><h2>  2. Registered letter </h2><br>  It differs from the usual in that you can track the passage of the letter and get a receipt, which clearly indicates where you sent the letter and when.  It is a little more expensive, 9 rubles 90 kopecks.  At the same time, registered mail is sealed, i.e.  difficult to replace something. <br><br>  Remember that a ‚Äúnormal‚Äù letter (simple, customized) weighs up to 20 grams.  If it is heavier, then you will have to pay on top of 70 kopecks per gram. <br><br><h2>  3. With declared value (with investment inventory) </h2><br>  Such a letter must be prepared.  First you need to prepare two copies of the inventory of what is inside the letter, indicating the value of each piece of paper.  On one inventory list, you will be given a note of admission, another mail worker, after checking, will put it in an envelope.  This is the only way to send legally significant letters, as the mail worker checks compliance.  In addition, the cost of the letter (declared) will be returned to you if you suddenly lose the letter.  The price here is considered more complicated, see the website. <br><br>  Separately, it should be said about the notification, it is an additional ‚Äúfeature‚Äù for any kind of letter.  That is, a small white piece of paper comes to you with a stamp and the date of the letter delivery. <br><br><h1>  7.
