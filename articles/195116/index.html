  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The unique IaaS solution from the company "Microtest"</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Migration of individual business applications and the entire IT infrastructure to the cloud is becoming an increasingly popular model for the development of corporate IT.  More and more Russian companies are actively implementing cloud solutions into their processes and are virtualizing their IT infrastructure in order to achieve greater flexibility and resiliency, as well as to achieve a significant reduction in operating and capital costs for the acquisition, maintenance and support of corporate IT. <br><br>  Today we consider one of the most relevant services for large and medium-sized businesses.  Leasing a virtual computing infrastructure (IaaS) is the first step to the diversity of cloud services: it allows you to get the necessary computing, disk and network capacity and all the necessary capabilities for optimal management of the leased infrastructure with minimal costs. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b>Cisco Unified Computing System (UCS) IaaS</b> <br>  Cisco today is one of the leading vendors in the development of solutions for the organization of corporate cloud services, in particular IaaS.  The Cisco approach to the implementation of commercial IaaS services is based on the Cisco Unified Computing System (UCS) solution, which is characterized by a high level of security and serves as the basis for creating a unified infrastructure to reduce costs, optimize resource use and provide the most secure virtual access to all offered services . <br><br>  On the territory of Russia, the vendor‚Äôs first solution was used by the Microtest company to organize its services, and in the beginning of October the project is scheduled to be launched into commercial operation.  The choice in favor of the approach and Cisco solutions was due to the fact that at the moment it is this company that offers the most modern scalable approach to virtualization solutions.  In particular, in Cisco solutions, the blade server is divided into two components: these are the chassis on which the blades are directly installed, and the so-called factory is the switch to which the chassis are connected.

      Mikrotest positions its solution as unique on the Russian cloud services market, since the entire cloud infrastructure of the provider is implemented on the basis of high-tech and high-quality equipment from leading world vendors.  The cloud is built on the FlexPod reference architecture, based on products from Cisco, Microsoft and NetApp. <br><br>  <b>FlexPod architecture is the best system for flexible management of your service.</b> <br>  FlexPod is a set of configurations of server and network equipment, data center software, offered by Cisco and NetApp and based on Cisco UCS servers, Cisco Nexus switches, and NetApp FAS storage systems.  This solution provides ready-made, unified and tested combinations of equipment that provide all the necessary tools for networking, computing and data storage facilities, the organization of cloud services, the operation of any standard set of technological or applied software. <br>  The benefits of FlexPod are in reducing the cost of architecture development, design, deployment, and testing.  The infrastructure deployment cycle is almost halved.  When using this solution, resource pools are managed, rather than individual systems. <br>  This is the industry's only solution for creating end-to-end secure multi-user environments.  It provides a consistent quality of service at every level and provides independent management of each resource pool.  Reducing risks and costs while increasing the flexibility of the IT infrastructure, as well as the proven Cisco architecture, has become one of the key components for us when choosing a solution. <br><br>  <b>Certificate "Cisco Powered Cloud Services for IaaS"</b> <br>  It is important to note that Microtest is now certifying the implemented infrastructure for obtaining the Cisco Powered Cloud Services for IaaS certificate.  No one cloud provider in Russia has this certificate yet.  The certificate will be received before the end of this year, and it guarantees the customer service in the high-tech cloud infrastructure of the provider, configured in accordance with the strict requirements and recommendations of Cisco. <br><br>  <b>The composition of the solution FlexPod</b> <br>  The process of installing and setting up the equipment took some time: first, the total weight of the equipment exceeded a ton;  secondly, the configuration was paid close attention - the subsequent growth of the infrastructure was taken into account. <br><br>  A huge help in configuring was provided by the fact that the design of the solution has the validation of hardware and software vendors - thus, many pitfalls were avoided and time costs were significantly reduced. <br><br>  I would also like to note the convenience of configuring the server factory using the built-in management and monitoring tools - Cisco UCS Manager. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage3/e84/196/444/e841964444bf2ca6563140b37166dc67.png"><br><br>  The solution includes: <br>  ‚Ä¢ Storage system: FAS3250HA. <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ Network infrastructure: <br>  - Catalyst 2960S 24 GigE; <br>  - Nexus 5548; <br>  - Cisco ASR1001. <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ Server infrastructure: <br>  - Blade Server UCS 5108 Blade Server Chassis; <br>  - UCS B200 M3 Blade Server blade servers with Intel Xeon E5 2680 processors and 256GB of RAM; <br>  - Fabric Interconnect UCS 6296UP - switches with integrated UCS Manager functionality. <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ Virtualization system and additional management and backup tools: <br>  - Microsoft Hyper-V 3.0; <br>  - Microsoft System Center 2012 SP1. <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ Factory management and monitoring tools: <br>  - Cisco UCS Manager; <br>  - Microsoft System Center 2012 SP1. <br><br>  <b>Functional "Personal Account" user IaaS</b> <br>  Paying great attention to the comfort and functionality of the client‚Äôs interaction with the Microtest service, the company developed and implemented a ‚ÄúPersonal Account‚Äù for cloud service users, which allows the client not only to order the service, but also to determine all of its relevant parameters: the number of virtual cores, virtual volume memory size of the required disk space.  The user will also be able to track online statistics using a large set of tools related to the provision of services. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage3/394/030/dd0/394030dd0780c8c70b73745c15b4f157.png"><br><br>  The ‚ÄúPersonal Account‚Äù was fully developed by the specialists of the Microtest company, taking into account and understanding the current needs of the company's customers, and it is already ready for use.  Due to the fact that the solution is independently developed, the company plans to constantly improve the "Personal Account", adding new features and capabilities for customers.  In the future, the ‚ÄúMy Account‚Äù will be closely integrated with the corporate financial system, and the customer will be able to generate all the necessary financial documents through the ‚ÄúMy Account‚Äù: invoices, acts of completed work, etc. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage3/20a/422/a14/20a422a14c55afe3d5abe6434dcb8b0c.png"><br><br>  <b>Advantages of the solution and its use</b> <br>  The Virtual Rentals (IaaS) service can be a full-fledged alternative to its own server and network equipment or even the entire corporate IT infrastructure.  Not only do you not need to buy expensive equipment in the property and periodically update it - this service allows you to completely get rid of the need for maintenance and support of this equipment. <br><br>  In addition, this service is an excellent option for those companies that are looking for a quality environment for developing and testing a new service or business process. <br><br>  Creating this solution, the company "Microtest" primarily focuses on large customers, hoping that the solution will be in demand in the financial sector of the market: banks, insurance companies, online trading and large retail networks.  The new cloud service will be interesting in the oil and gas sector.  In general, the transfer of customers can be very long - this decision will be obviously interesting to all those who are interested in quality, maximum customization and flexibility of the service provided, including small and medium businesses. <br><br>  <b>Conclusion</b> <br>  Cloud technologies make it possible to satisfy the company's IT needs without investing in the purchase of new equipment, its placement and operation.  In this case, the customer has at its disposal the most modern and advanced technologies.  Instead of buying and configuring new servers, keeping them in working condition, customers have a unique opportunity to quickly, simply and reliably get everything they need from the ‚Äúcloud‚Äù, paying only for really used resources.  By purchasing services from the Microtest company, in addition to the advantages already listed from the introduction of cloud solutions into the corporate IT infrastructure, the company receives highly reliable and high-quality service. <br><br>  <a href="http://portal.microtest.ru/">portal.microtest.ru</a> <br><br>  In more detail about the new solution will be told on October 2 at the conference <a href="http://microtest.ru/services/events/cisco/">"Migration of business applications in the" cloud ": how to ensure effective management and get the maximum benefit for the business?"</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/195116/">https://habr.com/ru/post/195116/</a></p>
