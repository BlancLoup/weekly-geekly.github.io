(Trash story)</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d26/22c/847/d2622c847dcc41f6aba1677c9619527b.png" align="left">  After reading the well-known book by Hank Reinwater, ‚ÄúHow to graze cats,‚Äù I came to the conclusion that perhaps this book is ideal for walking the already educated inhabitants of the ‚Äúfauna of programmers‚Äù.  However, what to do with newly graduated beginners?  Raising a new developer (nedoprogrammista) is very similar to raising a puppy, who does not yet understand where to defend the need and how not to foul at home. <br><br>  The appearance of a Junior-developer in a team takes time and additional forces in order to instill good habits and skills.  One of the most important habits is to teach him not <s>to throw heaps</s> in the code.  However, not everyone is able to inculcate these things, and the developer begins to constantly get the code dirty in the project.  Subsequently, there may be a number of difficulties that must be addressed immediately. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  If you want to get rid of this problem forever, then you should find out: <br><br><ol><li>  What can lead a developer to start writing bad code? </li><li>  How to quickly train Junior to write clean code? </li><li>  How to punish the guilty and whether it is necessary? </li><li>  How to behave if after the code review the employee does not want to be corrected? </li></ol><br><h3>  Why a novice shits in the code </h3><br>  An inexperienced developer whom you have hired may not even guess that he is crap in the code.  In the first months of their stay at home, most developers are in quarantine mode due to inexperience and commits only to individual branches of the project.  Therefore, for a small programmer to become quite familiar to write non-quality code and commit it to a strictly designated place where nothing breaks.  When you start entering a newbie into the main branch of a project, it can be fun to play and not code as you need.

    <blockquote>  It is important to remember that the culture of young stock code (like the urinary system in puppies) is not yet sufficiently developed.  A small programmer cannot maintain 8-hour intervals in the stream.  Therefore, without waiting for the next review, the puppy can make more than one pile or puddle. </blockquote><br>  Another reason could be a lack of attention.  It so happens that you motivated Junior well in the morning and left him alone for the whole day.  Wanting to protest, he may all of a sudden make a puddle in the simplest place.  In this way, he expresses dissatisfaction with his mentor, showing that he does not wish to remain alone for a long time. <br><br>  If there is a teen developer in your team who is accustomed to regularly review and write without crap, he suddenly starts to ‚Äúruin the mat‚Äù, pay attention to two alleged reasons.  Most likely, your employee is sick.  Very often, programmers who are engaged in a project disgusting for them have problems with their urinary system motivation and the once-clean project begins to smell like dog shit. <br><br>  Also your teenager could have burned out on a past project.  If he not only throws heaps of bad code in test environments, but also poops into the main branch of the project, this may be a sure sign of stress or resentment against his Tim Lida.  Do not ignore these reasons, it may be worth walking on vacation. <br><br><h3>  Effective ways to fight </h3><br>  There is plenty of advice on how to stop a puppy developer from needing code.  So, the basic rules: <br><br><ul><li>  Never shout at your novice (during and after the "crime").  If you start shouting after he has spoiled, he will take into account that you cannot be fooled and will hide from you to make a Skoda. <br><br></li><li>  Never hit Junior and stick your nose to the pile.  It offends him, and he does not understand why he, after a perfect fact, is punished. <br><br></li><li>  Always be consistent and constant.  If you want to teach code it is necessary to do it regularly at the same time.  If you did a review one day and you were too lazy on another day, and then you came and cursed ‚Äúpuppy‚Äù, he will not understand exactly what you demand from him. <br><br></li><li>  Always encourage your ward after he writes a normal piece of code.  Be sure to praise him. </li></ul><br><h3>  Sequential learning steps </h3><br><ol><li>  If after quarantine in a separate branch, you begin to introduce a novice into the base, then you need to do this before the kid makes a mess.  Track your ward, after what period of time he wants to go to the toilet. <br><br></li><li>  Make a code review at the same time.  Properly created mode will help puppy to sense your care and attention. <br><br></li><li>  Game-play learning puppies love to play.  The more the developer communicates with the others, the more quickly he will penetrate into the processes of the team.  Come up with games so that the newcomer can express himself, preferably trash games.  It will also lead to the desire to empty the intestines and only bright desires to the code-writing process will remain. </li></ol><br><h3>  Punishment methods </h3><br>  Remember, a puppy-developer, although not a full-fledged employee, is still a very smart creature that reacts quite sharply to the mood of his mentor.  If you do not offend your newcomer, he will respond to any of your requests.  Of course, it is difficult to calmly respond to a puddle or a pile made in a clean piece of code, but you can show your displeasure: <br><br><ul><li>  Change the tone of voice and chastise your recruit for what they did. <br><br></li><li>  Take your favorite toy (access to social networks) and let play only when the code is cleaner. <br><br></li><li>  As soon as you see that the beginner wants to get on, use the command: ‚ÄúUgh!  So be it!  That's how it should be: ... ... ... ¬ª.  He must understand how you feel about this and do the right thing. </li></ul><br><h3>  Conclusion </h3><br>  The use of these tips has helped many grow out of the puppy-developers of real pros who do not go to cope with the needs of the project code and keep order. <br><br>  Never give up and hold on to the sequence.  According to the results, the novice himself wants to unlearn himself and to become a normal programmer and a full-fledged member of the team. <br><br>  Let your recruit be the most obedient and "clean" team member!  Good luck! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/311696/">https://habr.com/ru/post/311696/</a></p>
