  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Lab</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Lazy Saturday and a friend of a friend (well, you know) sent a short story, which I decided to share with you (with his consent, of course;) <br><br>  *********************** <br><br>  He looked sadly at the creator.  He was a good creator, his father only recently bought him to him.  The creators were all at school, but there were only a few such classrooms.  He liked him very much, but now he will be taken away. <br>  The trouble was revealed in the morning.  And when he returned from school and rechecked everything - there was no doubt left. <a name="habracut"></a>  He has a reasonable life.  This in itself is, of course, not bad.  But usually, when a creator creates the universe to simulate a particular process or phenomenon, intelligent life does not appear.  Everything goes on as usual, what is needed is modeled, and then the universe collapses, as it was not.  Even if there are any bacteria or animals there, it doesn't bother anyone. <br>  But once a billion mind appears and a completely different story begins.  Usually it is noticed by artificial satellites around one of the planets.  Of course, finding such a thing in the vast universe is not easy, but all modern creators are equipped with automatic detectors of intelligent life.  So to get out in the style of "not noticed" will not work. <br>  My father came home from work and immediately sensed that something was wrong.  He looked at his son, then at the creator and, without saying anything, turned his eyes back to his son. <br>  ‚ÄúThere can be no mistakes,‚Äù said the son, ‚ÄúI rechecked everything several times.‚Äù  They already have several satellites and I returned the normal speed of time. <br>  - Why are you so upset?  We will get the money back and I will buy you the same creator. <br>  - I know.  But I'm used to it.  And my lab was very good.  You would see what kind of gas clouds I had. <br>  - So what?  A reasonable life is a good reason, which means you can pass the lab later.  If the mathematics is correct, then you will still have your gas clouds. <br>  - And I know that, but no one is watching the works reported later.  Assessment expose and forget.  - the son sadly spoke, and after a short silence he added - And you know, I don‚Äôt like it at all when intelligent life appears. <br>  - Well, intelligent life - this is probably our brothers in mind.  Or even our creators.  - began father.  - You know that our space time is very elastic.  We can not afford to take risks.  All creators with intelligent life are installed at a normal speed of time and are placed in a special repository, where they are, until intelligent life disappears by itself.  Well, or will not be reborn into something more.  We can crush a beetle, but we cannot kill a rational being, such are our moral principles.  Not remembering the possible real consequences. <br>  - And even that I knew everything.  - the son answered already more cheerfully - And maybe even it is good that they will take him away.  I seem to be nosyachil somewhere in the interactions and there the space-time breaks due to strong gravity, forming holes.  I will try to modify the model. <br>  Father just grinned.  He also made mistakes in his interactions as a child.  And who did not?
