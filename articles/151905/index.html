  <section class="page js-page"><h1>‚ÄúAuto Acceleration‚Äù: how to get into the Top 100 Google Play without money and what to do next?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  It all started on May 19, 2011, when friends for my birthday gave me a brand-new Google Nexus S smartphone. Before that, I worked as a programmer for a long time, then the specifics of my work changed, but ‚ÄúI remember hands‚Äù.  Therefore, I immediately planned to program something for my new cool smartphone, and wrote the <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/149894/">Auto-Acceleration</a> application.  Today I want to tell you what I learned, understood and did two months after the start. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <i>- According to statistics, the first two hours in a person‚Äôs life are considered the most dangerous.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>- There is an opinion that the last two hours are not without a certain risk ..</i> <br><br><h5>  A little about the development, or where we nakosyachili </h5><br>  The first version of the mobile application, of course, was planned for Android.  By this time I had already managed to write a couple of applications that were published on Google Play.  And a dozen more test ones - in which some technology was tried.  I immediately chose NetBeans as the development environment.  For two reasons: first, I didn‚Äôt like Eclipse from my student days: something didn‚Äôt work there once.  Of course, we later found the spoons - but the sediment remained.  Secondly: I liked NetBeans, I programmed a bit on ROR using this IDE.  So I did not think for a long time.  Now I think this is a mistake, but it's too late to fix it. <br><br>  There are no complaints to the medium itself, but with the Android SDK it works somehow clumsily.  Maybe I did not understand the details - but somehow.  In addition, some handy tools are available for Eclipse, but not for NetBeans.  What is worth only the opportunity to watch logcat in the development environment! 
      <br>

      <br>
      Sometimes when updating the SDK, everything suddenly broke, and somewhere I had to prescribe something, delete it, rename it ... It is possible that using Eclipse leads to similar problems, but I hope that this is not the case. <br><br>  About half a year I programmed in proud loneliness.  I will not say that it took all my free time, but for me this area was unfamiliar, and even simple things were done for a long time.  Finally, that moment came when I decided for myself: an interesting idea, technical implementation is possible.  It‚Äôs time to use the ‚Äúfriend help‚Äù hint.  So there were two of us, and the issue of version control received the status of "must right now" instead of "oh well, so far so somehow." <br><br>  At work, we use SVN, but for development from home this is not very suitable: we need a repository in a public place.  And this is a direct road to, for example, bitbucket.  I went there.  We chose Tortoise Hg as a client, because we use a similar product for SVN.  And here I made the second mistake.  I uploaded all my projects to the created repository.  And this is generally quite inconvenient: it was necessary to make a separate repository, or whatever it is called, for each project.  Understanding of this came, as usual, a little later. <br><br>  The project includes not only a mobile application, but also a website.  According to preliminary estimates, the site was planned very simple, and it could be done in just a couple of weeks.  Therefore, it was decided to first bring the application to readiness for publication, and then take up the site.  To do this, the third party connected to the team. <br><br>  The site that can be done in two weeks, we did for three months.  Because you can not do anything in two weeks. <br>  This should have been done long before the application was ready, because we just lost that time. <br><br>  In the future, revealed another of my cant.  At the prototype development stage, I installed a minimal version of Android 2.3.  In 2.2 there were some troubles with the use of GPS.  And then it turned out that we have a lot of users with Android 2.2 and they also want the application. <br><br><h5>  Publication: triumph, victory, bright prospects </h5><br>  July 30, we finally posted the application on Google Play.  Immediately, various steps were taken to promote the project.  First, I wrote on a dozen of specialized forums: a project for car enthusiasts, and our brother likes to sit on thematic resources, especially during working hours.  Secondly, I spent as much as a hundred dollars on AdMob advertising.  Of course, I realized that such a sum could not give a tangible effect, but it was just interesting.  To promote the site, we used the Sape service.  A little later, an article was written on Habr√© in the ‚ÄúI am promoting‚Äù section and an article on w3bsit3-dns.com within the framework of the program ‚Äúsupport for Russian developers‚Äù. <br><br>  A little more about each of these actions and the effect produced.  Thematic forums were the most effective, easiest and free way to promote.  Apparently, the idea turned out to be really quite interesting, as the people began to read, write, ask, ask anything, put good marks on Google Play.  I think that I will not be mistaken if I say that in total the topics about our project gained more than 100,000 views.  We were very happy when, through the Yandex metric, we found discussions in forums where we had never been.  There were very few negative reviews and posts, which gave me confidence: we are on the right track.  Despite the fact that the application is available for download only in Russian-speaking countries, after a couple of days it fell under the heading "Gaining Popularity" on Google Play, and then completely settled in the "Top New Free."  The increase in active devices was more than 300 per day.  A record number of page views is 10,000 per day.  Against this background, 100 dollars in AdMob are lost like a drop in the ocean. <br><br>  A week later, I wrote an article on w3bsit3-dns.com.  And created a thread on the forum, with the placement of apk.  The application is free, and I absolutely did not feel sorry for posting it.  The article turned out to be useful: more than 1000 users downloaded the application from w3bsit3-dns.com.  This is certainly not a lot, but I think much more went to Google Play - because everything is free.  The discussion was already more constructive and critical: people pointed to existing analogues, looked for flaws in the method of the application. <br><br>  A week later, I published an article on Habr√©.  Great hopes were pinned on it - after all, Habr is one of the most popular IT resources in runet, it is constantly read, many comments are made, and of course everyone tries, tries to break, criticize, advise - in general, feedback is provided.  But, probably, the note was not very interesting, or the automotive topic is not very close - the article‚Äôs rating turned out to be not very high, they commented on it a little, they didn‚Äôt break anything.  Effect not noticed.  So I did something wrong. <br><br>  The SEO campaign for our site is actually quite funny at this stage.  It was launched as a ‚Äúpen test‚Äù.  And the specificity of the resource does not imply a million visits: the number of search queries for the phrase ‚Äúoverclocking to 100‚Äù in Yandex is about 15,000 per month, and for the rest of the relevant topics, even less.  But with the tools more or less sorted out, you can safely sculpt on the fence ads "promotion of sites cheap." <br><br>  But all the minor failures could not even disappoint us a little: after all, we were in the "Top of new free ones".  Over the month, more than 20,000 people have installed our app.  True, the number of measurements on the site was much lower - several hundred, but this number has steadily increased, and this is the main thing. <br><br><h5>  Web Ready Siberia 2012 </h5><br>  With such a beautiful, popular project, it was just necessary to light up on some forum.  Finding somewhere in the depths of Habr a publication with a list of thematic events, I selected a number of them and wrote letters, submitted applications.  As a result, it turned out that only Web Ready is interesting from those planned in the near future.  Moreover, there is no competition for the Siberian stage of the event, everyone can take part.  So I bought a train ticket, and in early September I went to Novosibirsk.  Unfortunately, exactly one month after the publication, the application fell out of the ‚ÄúTop New Freeware‚Äù section - probably, these are Google‚Äôs rules, and the number of installations per day decreased from 700 to 70, and the number of deletions was 200-300, so it remains.  The number of active devices began to fall sharply ... but the picture, by the way. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/132/209/3fe/1322093fe3a054e95e711036c983e075.jpg"><br><br>  This is depressing. <br><br>  The first day of the event was focused on learning.  The organizers gave two lectures and talked to the contingent.  I must say, there were very few projects - about a dozen.  On the one hand, it upset me: I assumed that it was a very popular competition, and here there are only ten projects.  On the other hand, the competition is less!  Although I didn‚Äôt count on victory at all: our project is very young and doesn‚Äôt bring anything but losses.  Anyway, it does not pull on a revolution in the IT world.  But there is always hope.  I must say: the idea to go on Web Ready Siberia was super-correct.  I realized that already on the first day.  Firstly, I liked the presentations of lecturers: the guys spoke sensibly, interestingly, convincingly.  And even if nothing fundamentally new was said, I have already read or heard all this, anyway: I liked it. <br><br>  It was also curious to talk with the guys who brought their projects.  The fact is that there are always doubts.  And in my case, the main doubt is the main doubt, ‚Äúbut am I engaged in this nonsense?‚Äù.  Nobody really needed, and even funny.  Is it worth it to tell dear people about it?  And even 20,000 downloads could not convince me completely to the contrary.  And looking at the projects of other guys, I realized that they are the same as mine - as a rule, this is also doubtful nonsense.  Won the project is quite serious.  But this is a different weight category: a group of 10 people has been engaged in it for several years, with financing, the customer - and we just published some garbage on Google Play.  In short, I happily realized that my nonsense is not alone, and will not be distinguished by a special meaninglessness. <br><br>  And it turned out that the people had already heard about my project: both the participants of the competition, and even the organizers showed interest, found out: ‚Äúwell, are you the Auto Acceleration?  Let's communicate!".  And it was important: I was convinced that my undertaking has a perspective. <br><br>  On the second day there was the contest itself and another great lecture, which was given by Alexander Lyskovsky (one of the founders of the Alawar company). <br><br>  The most important thing is the performance of the participants.  The jury was about seven experts, and each project was given 7 minutes to speak.  I don‚Äôt like to speak much at all, the format of the round table is closer to me.  But competition is competition.  After the presentations, a ‚Äúcarousel‚Äù was arranged with the jury members: the projects took turns approached them and individually talked with each expert, received criticism, advice. <br><br>  Of course, the significantly stronger team won.  But according to the organizers, my project also got a lot of votes.  This pleasantly surprised me, because I thought that the victory of strong teams would be unconditional, and my idea is extremely poorly monetized, and therefore doomed to the last place. <br><br>  Summing up the trip, I will say: it was a useful two days.  And even in the local Harats at the station is bad with unfiltered German beer, everything was fine.  The main bonus is the conviction that everything is not so bad with my project, and it can be developed and can even be earned sometime. <br><br><h5>  And where is the iPhone? </h5><br>  The most obvious next step is to develop a version of the application for iOS.  With all the modifications that will soon be made with the Android version: adding the game moment, adding functionality - all that was decided to do on the basis of the trip.  I started reading about the development for iOS. <br>  Most of the authors, including here, argue: the correct development for iOS should be done only on a Mac.  And if the use of sensors is implied, then the emulator is absolutely not suitable.  I walked around the apartment, walked ... even went to the country: I did not find poppies and iPhones.  Of course, I knew about this problem in advance.  And shared it in informal communication with experts on the web ready.  It turned out that one of the projects that some time ago fell into the sphere of interests of Alexander Lyskovsky is a crowdfunding platform ‚ÄúFrom the World.‚Äù  A group of comrades made an analogue of the enemy KickStarter, which, as we know, does not work very well for us.  And really, I thought.  I have such a popular project, more than 20,000 installations on android!  Is there really no thousand or other people willing to donate rubles 50 or 100 to create an application on the iPhone, and I‚Äôll just buy a couple of macMini and iPhone, and I‚Äôll make the same application!  And then we will enter the world market, we will sell paid versions and earn millions!  All ingenious is simple.  Motorists loyal to the project cannot but support me !!! <br><br><h5>  Crowdcrafting in Russian </h5><br>  So, the fundraising campaign for my team has started.  The first steps were registration on the site, adding a project, drawing up its description.  It's simple.  Very soon Dasha, the PR director of the company ‚ÄúWith the world on the thread‚Äù, contacted me.  As far as I understand, there are not so many people in the team, and there are no mere mortals: there can be no posts below the director in startups, this is a concept.  Dasha very sensibly explained to me the technology of work, sent examples of descriptions of projects, said that to correct, what to add, everything in essence.  True, it turned out that I logged in vain on the site using a Google account.  You can log in, but the project could not be correctly issued. <br><br>  The whole procedure took about a week: they verified the description, sorted out the login, made a contract (no one signs anything, you just read the PDF file and say you agree).  And in the text of the contract itself, the only obligation of the client is to pay remuneration in case of a successful fundraising.  And the reward is deducted automatically when you pay. <br><br>  The biggest challenge was coming up with motivating factors for people sending money.  It turned out (it‚Äôs still good that I checked in advance, I don‚Äôt know what made me think about it) that iOS applications will not work to distribute to anyone for free.  And there is a desire to make all the same the paid version.  As a result, a solution was found: the publication of two applications, one paid, the other free.  And in asking for a free password.  Of course, if the application succeeds, these passwords will diverge around the country.  But if there is success - yes, all right, do not mind!  The second factor, comic character, was the assignment of funny titles and awards.  We are planning a system of "achivok" of various kinds, and it is logical to award sponsors with special medals. <br><br>  Dasha was very optimistic.  Yes, I myself believed in success: after all, my android application is popular, and car forums are just a promotion bomb!  It's time to go to the store to choose devices. <br><br>  So, a couple of days ago the project was published, the campaign started.  Immediately I throw a hundred rubles to myself to check how everything works.  Everything is working.  Fine!  We urgently write on the mastered forums and we ask the price of devices.  To meet the deadline, it is necessary to collect only 2000 per day, these are 20-30 people.  Of those thousands who read my posts, there will certainly be more. <br><br>  It was not there.  Fiasco.  It does not work at all!  Of course, with reference to my project - who knows, maybe something more outrageous and material will have more chances.  But today I can say: the people are not ready to participate in this.  For three days only one unknown benefactor - I suspect someone from my friends transferred 500 rubles.  All the rest gave me a lot of free tips.  As you know, free advice costs exactly as much as paid for it.  Immediately there were many IT specialists telling that their acquaintances program well under the iPhone on their pirated Windows, many wished good luck, even the big ones said that they had to earn money themselves and not beg, but no one decided to take part.  Before the end of the fundraising, there are still 42 days, but I am pretty sure that nothing will come of it.  In Russia, it does not work yet, alas.  Maybe, of course, the guys from ‚ÄúC world by thread‚Äù will think up something, and everything will change, but I am tormented by vague doubts. <br><br><h5>  findings </h5><br>  It is extremely premature to draw conclusions about the project itself than a year after publication.  I have thoughts on how to develop it, change it - and you will know about it when it happens.  But we have received practical confirmations of literal truths.  It is not so difficult to do something of your own.  Even something interesting.  Certainly much better than doing nothing.  Even creating something stupid and unnecessary is much more useful than doing nothing.  Without much financial expenditure, everyone familiar with modern IT technologies can offer the public something, become the author of their project.  It is unlikely that it will be possible to get money for it - only a small percentage of such enterprises bring at least some tangible profit.  But experience and knowledge are provided, and this increases the chances of a successful project in the future. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/151905/">https://habr.com/ru/post/151905/</a></p>
