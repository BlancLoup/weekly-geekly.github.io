      In the main part - in fact, on ‚Äúcrash tests‚Äù, three startups will perform.  Enough worked out to appear before a demanding audience of colleagues and leading industry experts.  They will be given 15 minutes for the presentation, and the same amount will be devoted to questions.  At the moment, the organizers have confirmed the participation of two projects: <br><br>  <b>CityRadar.ru</b> ( <i>‚ÄúCoordinates of Smart Prices‚Äù</i> ) - the idea <a href="http://cityradar.ru/">of collective discount service</a> , first announced at Harvest in February, began to be implemented in April, when <b>Yevgeny Petrova</b> found like-minded people, and later - investments.  The project was launched in late July, immediately pleased with the mass of offers from cafes and restaurants, as well as establishments from the spa &amp; wellness area. <br><br>  The team considers its trump cards to be the possibility of ordering corporate events (for example, banquets) at a discount, as well as renewing already completed offers (if the necessary number of participants is recruited again).  Today, in addition to Moscow, CityRadar works in Krasnodar, in the future planning to expand in major cities across the country.  The immediate goal is to enter the top three of the most popular Russian services in its subject matter. <br><br>  <b>Wannafuck</b> ( <i>‚ÄúCynical, but not immoral‚Äù</i> ) is a <a href="http://wannafuck.ru/">speed-dating service</a> , which aims to bring the process of virtual dating to life and then maximally transfer communication from online to real environment.  Having visited the site, the user will see a passing cloud of photos of girls or guys, among whom he will have to choose his dream.  If you do not have time to click, or someone will beat him, you will hardly see her / him again.  If the couple wants to talk, she will have only a few minutes to arrange a real date.  So that the site is not flooded with lovers of exotic and commercial accounts, it is planned to introduce a hard moderation and confirmation of identity for users. <br><br>  Two years <b>Rustem Bogdanov</b> worked on the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãsuch a service, and began to implement it with the April Harvest.  His project has already attracted the first investment, and also received confirmation for the next round.  Now Wannafuck works in the alpha for their own.  Invites for closed beta testers are distributed simultaneously.  Launch of the open version is scheduled for 2011.  In order to make as many real acquaintances as possible, the couple will be offered interesting places for meetings, discounts, bonuses, etc.  Now the project already has three partner services, the last of which is the recently opened gift-giving operator <a href="http://darru.ru/">Darru.ru</a> .  The latter is also a graduate of Harvest - November, which was recently held at the <a href="http://incube-ane.ru/">InCube</a> ANK <a href="http://incube-ane.ru/">Business Incubator</a> . <br><br>  The name of the third project for the "crash test" has not yet been determined.  Perhaps you wish to submit it.  The project should have a prototype, it is desirable to have the first sale.  Want to speak?
