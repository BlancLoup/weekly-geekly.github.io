Plus I called again today. <br><br>  Let's go back to the beginning and explain what's the matter.  There is a certain information retrieval resource blizko.ru <br>  On it you can find quite a lot of companies that provide certain services.  There is a page for viewing contacts and other information about companies.  So on this page I saw an unusual link " <i>this is my company</i> ": <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/392/162/beb/392162beb3629f181e1f333938cda871.png">

      I registered, clicked this link and what did I see?  Yes, that's what: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/a0b/7df/1fd/a0b7df1fdb7aeea03e65d53aff5360b2.png"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  I wrote in those support that they probably have some kind of mistake.  Not received a response so far.  I called them twice.  The first time I was told that this is how it should be (They said that they were checking the input information. I changed the phone number of one of the companies for 5 days, but nobody checked anything), the second time they said that they would figure it out. <br>  But so far nothing has happened.  Any registrant can simply pick up and assign a company to any person / organization. <br><br>  Today called them again.  He recalled the situation and said that I was going to publish an article on this ‚Äúfeature‚Äù on a well-known resource.  I was sent a letter with the following content: <br><br><blockquote>  All information is publicly available on the Internet is absolutely free for both site users and creators.  During the five years of the portal‚Äôs existence, we did not encounter the problem of ‚ÄúCapturing‚Äù other companies ‚Äôcards, and why?  There is nothing confidential about them. <br><br>  You can be attached only to the company that does not have a user, no more than three companies per email address. <br>  Any company falls on moderation, and if something is changed in it.  If you make "incorrect" information, the company will not pass the moderation, and accordingly will be rejected.  When changing the phone or address, the information is displayed as correct and the company continues to exist on our portal. <br><br>  The reliability of all phone numbers and addresses, unfortunately, is not possible to verify. <br></blockquote><br><br>  Almost all companies do not have users there.  And about "no more than three companies per 1 email address" - no one bothers a scammer to get at least 10 addresses. <br>  Moreover, you can change phone numbers and addresses, then change the data about the company.  You will have to assert the correctness (unless they have a database of old addresses, which can be doubted). <br><br>  Morality. <br>  Be careful when posting information about yourself / your organization on various informational sites.  In this case, you risk just becoming a victim of fraudulent schemes related to the substitution of addresses and phone numbers on the site.  And given that on this site, accounts also have paid versions, you run the risk of losing money as well. <br><br>  ps Can mass transfer of the organizations to users will serve as a lesson of administration and those.  backed by this company? </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/136014/">https://habr.com/ru/post/136014/</a></p>
