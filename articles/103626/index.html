      Lisa Lavie was born in Canada (1983), managed to work in many places, including a cashier in a supermarket, where she managed to save $ 5000, for which she recorded her first professional demo album.  The disk, long walked on the different production companies, while in 2004.  did not fall into the hands of well-known producer and songwriter Ben Margoules, producer of the first song Mariah Carey.  After 3 months, Ben Margulies phoned to Lisa, and she was in the center of the supermarket and sang him a song of his own composition ‚ÄúGuys Are All the Same‚Äù. <br><br>  In March 2007, Lisa opened an account on Youtube, intended to be a mirror of her page on MySpace, she posted videos of her own songs.  And in the next 6 months in person!  responded to all comments.  The service bot even suspected that it was spamming and blocked the account, but the action was arranged by fans and the lisalavie1 profile was unblocked two days after blocking.  A week later, she posted a song of her own composition, Angel, the clip broke out on the main pages of the service and received over a million views during the day (3 years ago it was extremely rare).  She was invited to various Youtube events, in particular, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube_Awards">Youtube Awards</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube_Live">Youtube Event.</a> <br><br>  At the end of 2008, the lisalavie profile had 35,000 subscribers, its videos were viewed ~ 13,000,000 times, 96,000 comments and 52,000 times videos were marked as favorite.  In 2009, the figures rose to over 112,000 subscribers, 30 million views, 118 thousand comments, 126,000 favorite marks, on average every 1.8 seconds, someone on the planet watched (listened) to her songs. <br><br>  4 years of work and released debut album - "Everything or nothing".  The release on May 13, 2008 on Itunes immediately hit the main page, the What's Hot section.  The album reached the 20th place in the pop section and the 70th in the general chart.  So without a producer, a producing company, this gifted and aspiring girl achieved the universal recognition of her talent with the help of Youtube. <br><br>  In February 2010, to support those affected by the earthquake in Haiti, Lisa gathered 57 artists and organized a joint song We Are The World ( <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisa_Lavie">Wiki</a> <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3D9hhX0KkQBW4">Youtube</a> ) <br><br>  I really liked Earth Song in its version - <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/lisalavie1">www.youtube.com/user/lisalavie1#p/u/2/1O1YA40TvBc</a> (no doubt, no one will sing this song better than the author, but Lisa is on top) <br>  Actually her Youtube account is <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/lisalavie1">www.youtube.com/user/lisalavie1</a> <br>  Wikipedia Page (Lisa Lavie) - <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisa_Lavie">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisa_Lavie</a> <br><br><h2>  Danny MacAskill </h2><br><br><iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/Z19zFlPah-o%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700023,15700186,15700191,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhiB5oytBAgnYpnFRB7RlvkkAP3QkQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  Also known as ‚ÄúTaggart‚Äù and ‚ÄúDanny MegaSkill‚Äù, a professional ‚Äústuntman‚Äù on bicycle.
