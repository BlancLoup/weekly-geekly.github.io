    <h2>  <font color="#0071c5">1. They know the value of deferred remuneration.</font> </h2><br>  Our culture is built mainly on short-term pleasures.  We tend to take on the business for which the reward can be obtained easily and quickly. <br><br>  <a href="http://blog.mbaconsult.ru/blog/personal/7-veshchey-sdelat-uspeshnymi-1/">Highly productive people are</a> well aware of the fruits of their efforts, and often seek to bring long-term goals to the end.  They split up major cases into smaller ones in order to experience the joy of victory more often.  As <b>James Dean</b> said, "The reward is related to the process, not to the results." <br><br>  Start promoting yourself for perseverance.  Take time to celebrate long-term achievements.  So you will stop postponing tasks with a flexible deadline or those of them for which you need to take a few steps. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0071c5">2. Their ideas about the cost of time are more realistic.</font> </h2><br>  It seems to you that the task will take 3 hours to complete.  But you do not have a "window" of this size.  And you want to postpone the matter until the moment it appears. <br><br>  Forget about what you need 3 hours - it may take as little as 90 minutes.  Successful people just get down to business, no matter how much time they have, and see what happens. <br><br>  They try not to panic, not to think that ‚Äúit takes an entire eternity!‚Äù, And methodically destroy the fortress.  They spend their time, and each time they take up work, they are nearing completion. <br><br>  And this is enough for them. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0071c5">3. They ignore their inner perfectionist</font> </h2><br>  Yes, your <a href="http://blog.mbaconsult.ru/blog/personal/dovody-v-polzu-snizheniya-ozhidaniy/">inner perfectionist</a> and procrastinator are intimate friends.  The perfectionist constantly tugs at your floor, helpfully reminding you that you are not doing everything well enough ... and here you can do better ... Because of him, every task seems even worse than it actually is, and you have no desire to take on it right now . <br><br>  Give up defeatism.  To silence your perfectionist, you don‚Äôt need to do a job that‚Äôs bad or underperform.  Just learn to reassure yourself with the phrase: "I will do everything in my power, and this will be enough." <br><br>  Take a look at <b>Sirena Williams</b> : her success is extremely high, and behind her many accomplishments.  But at the same time, she, like everyone else, is constantly struggling with her inner perfectionist.  ‚ÄúI‚Äôm completely insatiable,‚Äù she says.  ‚ÄúI think there are many more things that I could do better.‚Äù <br><br>  But this does not prevent her from competing with others.  She is able to take risks, ignoring the internal destructive whisper, and this is enough for her to go forward. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0071c5">4. They excel at <a href="http://blog.mbaconsult.ru/blog/personal/chto-takoe-zhizn-poisk-smysla-zhizni-s-ispolzovaniem-biznes-strategii/">prioritizing.</a></font> </h2><br>  First of all you solve the simplest tasks from your list for the day?  Such tactics are tempting, because it allows us to get to the desired momentary reward and feel the taste of victory, which, as it seems to us, will inspire us in the fight against more complex tasks. <br><br>  Only usually this does not happen. <br><br>  The most successful people first take on the most complex and important things to get them out of the way. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0071c5">5. They do not advance events.</font> </h2><br>  Oh, here are the phrases with which you can persuade yourself to postpone some things: <br><br>  ‚ÄúAnd if I get bad?‚Äù ‚ÄúAnd if the authorities don‚Äôt like it?‚Äù ‚ÄúAnd if I‚Äôm hanging on this for a long time?‚Äù <br><br>  You are there - in the future - not yet. <br><br>  Successful people first do and only then begin to worry about the results.  As <b>Roger Babson</b> said: ‚ÄúRemember: neither success nor defeat can be considered the final.‚Äù <br><br>  Do not transfer your projects to your fears.  Most likely, your fears will not be justified.  Stop thinking about them and do a better job. <br><br>  <strong>PS We</strong> recommend another useful article on the work on yourself - <a href="http://testutor.ru/blog/kak-uspeshnye-lyudi-spravlyayutsya-s-prokrastinaciej/">How successful people cope with procrastination</a> . <br><br>  The author of the translation is Vyacheslav Davidenko, the founder of the <a href="http://testutor.ru/">TESTutor</a> company. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/314234/">https://habr.com/ru/post/314234/</a></p>
