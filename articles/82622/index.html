    <a name="habracut"></a><br>  <a href="http://geektimes.ru/users/boomburum/" class="user_link">Many</a> thanks to <a href="http://geektimes.ru/users/boomburum/" class="user_link">Boomburum</a> , who gave me this device. <br><br>  Here is the box I received: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/f2d/b54/7da/f2db547daaa84528c1bc77390855c117.jpg"><br><br>  The most common box, but we know what hides in it. Open the lid, and here we have a powerful beast.  Turned off, while still quiet, did not feel the hands of the gamer.  (I apologize for the glare in the photo) <br><br><img src="http://i082.radikal.ru/1001/db/61a20f7e3c7b.jpg"><br><br>  Here, in fact, all the contents of boxing: <br><br>  - The mouse itself - Razer Naga <br>  - Razer Brochure Catalog <br>  - Instruction <br>  - Advertisements <br>  - Branded stickers <br>  - Trainers (trainers, but about them later) <br><br><img src="http://s54.radikal.ru/i144/1001/7c/7cdf5947c906.jpg"><br><br>  Well, and a little technical features, and then we move on to the details. <br><br><img title="Snapshot" src="http://blog.kuuuzya.ru/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/2.JPG" alt="" width="649" height="323"><br><br><h2>  Sensations </h2><br><br>  Because I did not have the opportunity to immediately turn on the mouse, I will tell you about the impressions that it produces. <br><br>  So, this is a black matte mouse.  It looks quite impressive: ergonomic design, company logo, rubber buttons 1-12, a combination of matte and glossy finish. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/504/ec1/e0f/504ec1e0f32ccbad3ec79c95e452bdd8.jpg"><br><br>  In his hand, the mouse is like a glove.  Very convenient for gamers, and for the simple user.  I will say right away that I used it for almost 6 hours without a break, my hand was not tired, my wrist did not hurt, although I suffer from such problems with ordinary mice for a long time.  Pleases some support on the right side of the mouse for the ring finger, which does not take part in the management.  The thumb rests on the pleasant covering of the buttons (read further about trainers).  The index and middle fall into the recesses of the buttons.  No discomfort while holding the mouse is not tested. <br><br>  In general, at first glance, the mouse is very convenient, but let's see what can actually be done with it. <br><br><img src="http://s001.radikal.ru/i193/1001/d2/60a5f5aba152.jpg"><br><br>  So, this is how Naga looks like, not turned on, without power, but you just plug it into the USB port and its ‚Äúface‚Äù will change.  The buttons light up in blue, it also floods the wheel, the company logo will appear.  The animal begins to breathe ... <br><br><img src="http://s005.radikal.ru/i210/1001/b6/604663d04243.jpg"><br><br>  But let us return from the lyrical digression to the truth of life. <br><h2>  No driver </h2><br>  First, consider the device, or rather its panel with numbers, without installing the software, that is, as its computer perceives, - like a normal mouse. <br><br>  Just want to say that on the underside of the mouse is nothing new, just the 123-NUM switch, which allows you to switch the layout of buttons 1-12, and of course, the laser positioning system (well, let's call it that) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/c64/0b0/bad/c640b0bad5fef9e8c40afc0e54cad46a.jpg"><br><br>  These buttons do not represent anything special: they just duplicate the action of the keys on the keyboard (from 1 to = or the NumPad keys).  In principle, their use is very useful if you work with a calculator, in Excel, or you can place an order in an online store - and it is very convenient to set the quantity.  But, this is only a small part of what can be done with this mouse. <br><br>  Little did not like the buttons next to the LMB.  Not comfortable.  The index finger is not convenient, and you will not reach the big one.  However, maybe for someone they will become irreplaceable (I put copy-paste functions on them). <br><br>  I will not dwell on this anymore and proceed directly to installing the driver for this device.  From this point on, your perception of reality will change.  You will feel the power over the world .. <br><br>  Side view. <br><br><img src="http://s003.radikal.ru/i202/1001/48/f7ff1468fda0.jpg"><br><h2>  With driver </h2><br>  Again, consider the mouse action in the applications, and only then proceed to its target orientation - to the games. <br><br>  Here they are, advanced settings Razer Naga, here, it turns out where all the power was hidden. <br><br>  Here you can change almost everything (excluding the physical features of the device): from the presence of the backlight and to the DPI. <br><br><img src="http://s004.radikal.ru/i207/1001/be/d01146ff4b26.jpg"><img src="http://s003.radikal.ru/i204/1001/de/283d82dc98c5.jpg"><br><br>  So, on the main page you can customize the buttons.  It is proposed to put action on the buttons: <br><ul><li>  Cry </li><li>  Menu </li><li>  Scroll </li><li>  Forward </li><li>  Back </li><li>  Macro </li><li>  Sensitization </li><li>  Desensitization </li><li>  On-the-fly sensitivity </li><li>  Profile switching </li><li>  A single key (for example, Backspace) </li><li>  Scroll up </li><li>  Scroll down </li><li>  Off button </li></ul><br>  I think that all these samples are clear and I will not dwell on each, but I will separately tell you about macros, sensitivity and profiles, since  for this there are special separate tabs. <br><h3>  DPI </h3><br><h3><img src="http://i077.radikal.ru/1001/f0/586af546d9cf.jpg"></h3><br>  Here we see the careful and precise DPI setting.  I will try to briefly explain why it is needed at all for those who have never changed it and used what the mouse originally gives.  If to be pedantic, then dpi - dots per inc, that is, the number of points per linear inch.  Since these are not quite standard parameters for Russia, I will explain it easier.  DPI Used to indicate resolution, or, if simpler, to indicate the speed at which the cursor moves across the screen.  The higher the DPI, the faster the cursor moves accordingly. <br><br>  It would seem that it could be easier, the more - the better.  But no, not always, I tell you. <br><br>  Low DPI is very useful for several things: <br><ul><li>  You are a designer, and you need to be very precise.  Clearly draw a line or put an element of the composition </li><li>  You play a game where you need to very clearly position the heroes and so on. </li></ul><br>  In general, this mode is useful in cases where you need to do something very clearly, accurately and painstakingly. <br><br>  High DPI is useful: <br><ul><li>  You are a designer and you need to quickly paint over a large picture or apply some sharp strokes. </li><li>  You play Action and you have to react very quickly. </li></ul><br>  In any case, high DPI is useful for fast and powerful things. <br><h3><img src="http://s43.radikal.ru/i101/1001/7e/d03ec53aa972.jpg"></h3><br>  But you probably ask, why is there such a fine tuning here? <br><br>  And I will answer you - this is because Razer cares about consumers and allows them to choose for themselves the ideal setting.  That is why you can set exactly the DPI that will be convenient for you, not the manufacturer.  This is very convenient, because  you customize the mouse to suit you and it will be very convenient for you to use it.  I have, for example, 2 settings - for Photoshop and games - these are 2500 and 5000. Also, you can configure several presets and switch between them. <br><h3>  Profiles </h3><br><h3><img src="http://s006.radikal.ru/i215/1001/8c/8facb1989e40.jpg"></h3><br>  A very useful thing, especially if you put a profile switch on any button.  In essence, a profile is your saved settings for individual applications or users.  You can use them as you wish.  For example, I created profiles for design, web surfing and programming.  For Photoshop, 12 buttons are assigned to make settings, in Delphi they are certain constructions that are inserted into the code, but in Firefox, it is forward, backward, copy, print selected, etc. In general, it seemed to me very convenient. <br><h3>  Macros </h3><br><img src="http://s006.radikal.ru/i215/1001/30/2a0ddbf3554a.jpg"><br><br>  Do I need to tell what macros are?  I think no. <br><br>  I want to say one thing: with this mouse they are very useful, because  There are no very advanced settings for the buttons, you can give them virtually any action. <br><h3>  Trainers (trainers) or "navels" </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/e55/5b4/34a/e555b434a6e30dc941e67e70c73a1ed8.jpg"><br><br>  This is also quite an important lotion to this mouse, but we will not dwell on it for a long time. <br><br>  What it is?  - these are just rubber flaps that can be glued to the numeric keypad of the mouse in order to better navigate them.  It is quite convenient, because  you immediately know which button is where.  Razer offers several ways to apply them.  But you can do as you like, even glue all the buttons.  Conveniently, it is necessary, it helps to adapt, and the finger is soft on them. <br><h3>  Backlight </h3><br><img src="http://s003.radikal.ru/i204/1001/5d/0b2b0c319f3f.jpg"><br><br>  We can only enable or disable the highlighting of an element.  It's simple.  Sometimes it is necessary if someone is sleeping in the room, and the blue light interferes. <br><h2>  Games </h2><br>  And we finally turn to what this device was invented for - games. <br><br><img src="http://s47.radikal.ru/i116/1001/e0/8e55c98a19ca.jpg"><br><br>  At first I will tell NOT about MMORPG. <br><br>  So, Razer Naga can be used in other games. Yes, yes, it surprised me too, but I found this feature. <br><br>  Yes, the downside is that you cannot program these 12 buttons in games other than World Of Warcraft or Warhammer, BUT <br><ol><li>  Who is stopping you from programming macros, single keys and profiles in Naga Configurator? </li><li>  As digital buttons, they are also very convenient, for example, in games of Counter-Strike, Half-Life, Call Of Duty, etc. shooting games.  After all, buttons 1-0 switch weapons (!).  Believe me, this is really convenient.  But what to do with the wheel?  It cannot be unused.  Here you have 2 options: either leave it to duplicate switching weapons, or assign some action to it, because we can program a scroll. </li></ol><br>  In general, I found the use of the mouse in games and before installing WOW on a computer. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/09e/876/561/09e87656144aaf3410533fbbfb922efa.jpg" alt="http://www.nika-games.com/images/produkt/im_30_1364_2009_11_22_06_24_25_m.jpg"><br><br>  And finally, how does the management look like in World of Warcraft with the plugin. <br><br>  It is put like all plugins, so that fans will not have problems. <br><br>  Also, I think, there will be no difficulty in setting up.  I will give just a few screenshots for the experts to appreciate.  In general, the plugin changes the appearance of standard panels and adds its own.  You can only use this.  If you do not like the panel, then disable the plugin and configure the buttons with your hands through the configurator.  But it is more hemorrhoids uncomfortable. <br><br>  So look at the panel.  By the way, you can switch between them by pressing Shift + button (1-12) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/a3a/a44/50c/a3aa4450c994b38b05a716a2fb7e48bb.jpg"><br><br>  Below you can see areas of all panels that can also be fine-tuned.  Set their size, make a binding to the character, etc. <br><br><img src="http://s003.radikal.ru/i202/1001/4d/e52ec11c5a28.jpg"><br><br>  These are the main settings of the plugin. <br><img src="http://s006.radikal.ru/i213/1001/38/699bac29f6d6.jpg"><br><br>  Well, here you can switch between profiles of characters.  Conveniently, if you have several of them and for each you can make your own layout. <br><br><img src="http://s48.radikal.ru/i120/1001/d8/021279ddc4c9.jpg"><br><br><h2>  Totals + Lynch </h2><br><br>  Summing up, I would like to say once again about my own impressions: <br><br>  The mouse is good, quality.  It does not slip out of hands, as it sometimes happens, has quite fine settings.  In the hand it lies well, it is convenient, the hand does not get tired after a few hours of play.  In general, the mouse is like, even very much.  I believe that it is applicable not only for avid gamers, but also for people who sit at a computer for a long time and use it at a professional level. <br><br>  I believe that this mouse is really worth the price that is being asked for.  This is a really high-quality gaming mouse, not only for gamers. <br><br>  We now turn to the decomposition on the shelves of the pros and cons of all aspects of the device.  Already without impressions, just the facts. <br><h2>  Lynching department </h2><br>  <strong>Pros</strong> (from + to +++, where +++ is very good, + good) <br><ul><li>  Ergonomics +++ </li><li>  Design and material +++ </li><li>  Advanced Settings +++ </li><li>  DPI +++ </li><li>  Easy to play +++ </li><li>  Easy to work +++ </li><li>  Convenience in applications ++ </li><li>  WOW ++ plugin </li><li>  Macros, profiles ++ </li><li>  Switch 123 - Num + </li></ul><br>  <strong>Cons</strong> (from - to - - -, where - - - very bad, - bad) <br><ul><li>  Buttons near the Left Mouse Button - </li><li>  Missing driver disk - </li><li>  Price - </li></ul><br>  So, I think that the assessment of this mouse is 5 out of 5. Not 5+, but firm 5. <br><br>  So she lies on the table in her familiar surroundings: <br><br><img src="http://s004.radikal.ru/i205/1001/93/5191959082fc.jpg"><br><br>  And so it looks in the company of mice that were at hand: <br><br><img src="http://i069.radikal.ru/1001/7c/ab78f8e3682e.jpg"><br><br>  The best end of the review will be the phrase that really characterizes it: ‚ÄúFor gamers, by gamers‚Äù (For gamers, from gamers) <br><br>  Link to website: <a href="http://www.razerzone.ru/product/mouses/naga">Razer Naga</a> <br><br>  And you can follow me on <a href="http://twitter.com/kuuuzya">twitter</a> <br><br></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/82622/">https://habr.com/ru/post/82622/</a></p>
