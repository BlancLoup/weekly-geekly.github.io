I decided to write a similar story of our <a href="http://www.webpp.ru/">studio ‚ÄúWeb ++‚Äù</a> . <br>  How did we start our activity as students, from where did we get the first orders and money?  To your attention: a short story about the formation of its own website creation studio. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  How the idea was born </h4><br>  2005, I was 18 years old, I was a student at the Volgograd Polytechnic College, I studied in the specialty "Computers and Systems and Networks" in the 4th year.  The fact that I will work in the creation / promotion of sites I did not expect.  He was fond of system administration, was an ardent (!!! very ardent !!!!!) fan of Gentoo Linux, was engaged in martial arts, played the piano (yes, this is all very strange). <br><br>  In parallel with his studies, he worked as a system administrator in one of the local companies. <br>  Once, a classmate asked me to help with the development of the site, which he was assigned at work.  It was necessary to create a website of one cosmetology office, no elements of dynamics, bare HTML.  Having picked up a nice template, I made this site in 2 days.  The customer was satisfied, and I received 200 (!) Rubles for my work.  Without thinking for a long time, I concluded that it was possible to make money by creating websites and began to develop in this direction. <br>  Almost immediately, my classmate joined me, with whom we started all our activities. <br>  We had neither experience nor basic knowledge, in fact there was nothing, including money :) But there were ideas and a desire to develop. <br><br>  Needed literature.  I purchased the book Luke Welling, Laura Thomson "Web Application Development with PHP and MySQL."  After reading, we were ready to move mountains and thought that we were all in the teeth. <br>  And so it has been 4 months. <br>  By that time, I found VDS preinstalled with Gentoo Linux and pretty quickly picked up everything we needed.

      <b>First orders</b> <br><br>  Order was required.  He was found by my companion, it was necessary to develop a site for a shop selling auto parts for domestic cars.  We made this site in 3 weeks and received 5000 rubles.  The store director, in principle, did not care about the site, as long as he was, and in which case he could refer to it.  Every month they paid 500 rubles.  for those.  site maintenance (of our own free will, by the way), we had the first almost ‚Äúfree‚Äù flow of money, albeit small. <br><br>  Next was the session, diploma, admission to the university.  Everything went well, and we continued our activities. <br><br>  At the university, we studied with a very talented person in terms of design.  We offered him to work with us, he agreed, and there were three of us. <br>  More orders were needed. <br>  My, at that time already former classmate from college, had a business in the field of freight cars.  He needed a website, as well as a program for the implementation of simple workflow. <br>  We, three of us gladly set to work, for which we received a good amount of money.  It was decided to formalize our activities. <br>  I took up this issue. <br><br><h4>  Official activities </h4><br>  <b>SP or LLC</b> <br><br>  Choosing between IP and LLC was selected IP.  By the way, for some reason, many people believe that IP is not solid.  I have a lot of friends who carry out their activities as individual entrepreneurs, and some of them will have a better job than LLC and other legal forms.  In the same way with us, for all our activities I did not observe any problems. <br>  For registration of IP, I turned to a law firm that issued all the necessary papers to me, I just went to the notary only once and paid for the state.  fee in the bank - 600 rubles. In my opinion. <br>  Registration of all documents for registration of IP, we cost 2400 rubles. <br>  By the time the execution of all documents took about 20 days. <br><br>  <b>Checking account</b> <br><br>  Next, it was necessary to open a bank account.  We chose Sberbank, because of its statehood and rather close location from my place of residence. <br>  All documents for opening an account were also provided to us by the legal entity.  the office through which we registered the PI. <br>  Opening an account cost 2300 rubles.: 1000 rubles.  lawyers for the preparation of all documents and 1300 rubles.  for opening an account in the Security Council of the Russian Federation. <br>  Subscription fee in Sberbank - 700 rubles per month. <br>  When opening / closing a current account, it is necessary to notify tax authorities about this, otherwise a fine of 5,000 rubles is threatened. <br><br>  <b>Name of the company</b> <br><br>  This caused the most problems.  Many options were searched, and we settled on ‚ÄúWeb ++‚Äù.  Why?  I do not know.  It just came to mind, everyone liked it, decided to stop at it. <br><br>  <b>Site</b> <br><br>  We started developing the site for ourselves.  In parallel, I took courses in search engine optimization, where I received all the basic knowledge about what SEO is and what it is eaten with. <br>  At the time when the site was ready and posted online, I completed the courses and received a certificate in SEO.  Next, I optimized the site for targeted requests, posted links, and a month later we were in the TOP-3 by Google and Yandex.  In parallel, used contextual advertising.  And off we go.  The target audience increased on the site and not a small part was converted into calls, and then to customers. <br>  <i>"Spice acted"</i> Dune.  The job was. <br><br>  <b>Office</b> <br><br>  With the office came out all chocolate!  Due to my great luck, I have a free 3 bedroom apartment that we have equipped for an office.  Well, from this therefore no cost for a cleaner, security, etc.  Only communal + Internet on 1Mb. <br>  In total, about 2000 rubles are spent per month. <br>  No inconvenience.  It is warm in winter and cool in summer.  From the windows view of the river Volga.  In moments of special boot remained overnight. <br><br>  <b>Equipment</b> <br><br>  Need to work on something.  From home, I brought a system unit, my companion brought a laser printer.  To this we bought: <br><ol><li>  2 LCD monitors for 6500 rubles.  each.  Total 13000 rubles. </li><li>  System unit - 10,000 rubles. </li><li>  Laptop - 21,000 rubles.  + RAM bar for 2 GB - 1400 rubles.  Total 22400 rubles. </li><li>  ADSL modem - 1200 rubles. </li><li>  3 keyboards for 300 rubles.  each  Total 900 rubles. </li><li>  3 mice for 150 rubles.  each  Total 450 rubles. </li><li>  Twisted pair 50 meters - 250 rubles. </li><li>  Connectors 10 pieces - 40 rubles. </li></ol><br>  <b>Hosting</b> <br><br>  We use hosting from RU Center ( <a href="http://hosting.nic.ru/">http://hosting.nic.ru/</a> ) for projects in PHP and Dense Forest LLC ( <a href="http://diphost.ru/">http://diphost.ru/</a> ) for projects in Python.  In my own server, there has never been a need. <br><br>  <b>Accounting</b> <br><br>  We entrusted the accounting to a third-party accounting firm.  This is a significant time saving for little money - 1000 rubles per month. <br><br>  <b>Problems</b> <br><br>  The main problem with which we most often encountered is parallel study at the university.  Some possibly promising projects had to be abandoned, due to lack of time resources. <br>  Now study is over, free time has become more and we have a lot of ideas for development. <br>  However, even with studies, work has always been. <br><br><h4>  Conclusion </h4><br>  This is how we raised our business, being students at the time, without experience, without knowledge and without money. <br>  <u>The main thing is not to be afraid to try, and everything will turn out.</u> <br>  A few years have passed, income stability has formed, loyal customers have appeared, which do not allow us to sit idle.  Work brings only joy and pleasure. <br>  This is the short history of the emergence of <a href="http://www.webpp.ru/">the site creation studio in Volgograd - Web ++</a> . <br><br>  <b>UPD</b> : Opening our own website development studio cost us about 50,000 rubles. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/62714/">https://habr.com/ru/post/62714/</a></p>
