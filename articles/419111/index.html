Since last year, he has been working on the Modulz tool, which moves in the second direction and makes it possible to visually work with components on React. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e45/e64/fae/e45e64fae1ac554a025085cd0a61f911.png"><br><br><h4>  Overflow </h4><br>  A powerful <a href="https://overflow.io/s/F7AGBM/">example of what can be done in a tool</a> . <br><br><h4>  <a href="https://polypane.rocks/">Polyplane</a> </h4><br>  Another tool for testing responsive sites in the browser.

The result was a one-piece design tool and prototyping in the spirit of InVision Studio.  True, they didn‚Äôt really show a bunch of real components at React - although Framer components themselves were made at React, they aren‚Äôt spoken about connecting them to a real design system. <br><br><h4>  Figma </h4><br>  <a href="https://blog.figma.com/how-to-do-content-design-ux-writing-in-figma-d0e0ee77661e">Deliveroo's Ryan Cordell tells how interface writers work with designers</a> . <br><br><h4>  <a href="https://visualsitemaps.com/">Visual sitemaps</a> </h4><br>  The tool promises to create a visual map of the site based on the URL.  While you can sign up for the beta version. <br><br><h4>  <a href="https://relate.app/">Relate</a> </h4><br>  New interface design tool.  It is positioned as a visual work based on a code (something similar to Modulz from Colm Tuite) - moreover, it is alleged that you can immediately work with components on React (but not the fact that it uses a real product).

Sales of devices are growing vigorously, and major platforms are rapidly acquiring partnerships and integrations into everything connected to electricity and the Internet.  <a href="https://voicebot.ai/2018/07/10/smart-speakers-to-reach-100-million-installed-base-worldwide-in-2018-google-to-catch-amazon-by-2022/">By the end of the year, 100 million devices are predicted</a> ;  already <a href="https://www.comscore.com/Insights/Blog/Smart-Speaker-Penetration-Hits-20-Percent-of-US-Wi-Fi-Households">20% of American families have a smart column</a> .

Whether you were there or not, studying the topic is useful. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/707/9f9/b17/7079f9b17bd8698d028575d537062264.jpg"><br><br>  Nielsen / Norman Group conducted a <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/intelligent-assistant-usability/">meticulous user research of voice assistants from Amazon, Google and Apple</a> .  It turned out a chic analysis of current problems both in the main mode of operation and in the ‚Äúskills‚Äù of third-party authors.  This is one of the main articles of the month - in one sitting you can get acquainted with a bunch of pitfalls.  Especially a lot of complaints about the skills - they are difficult to find, they are more dumb. <br><br>  It can be seen that voice assistants have a very long way to go in order to become really useful.  On the other hand, smartphones also had a lot of problems about 15 years ago, but were able to become radically more convenient and practical.  In general, one of the most useful materials on the topic of voice interfaces. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/009/315/5c4/0093155c424a35fd97b27cd2c5105c35.png"><br><br>  The main book - <a href="https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/designing-voice-user/9781491955406/">Designing Voice Interfaces from Cathy Pearl</a> .  She, by the way, manages the design of Google Assistant and recently described the <a href="https://www.uxmatters.com/mt/archives/2018/05/making-the-shift-from-designing-guis-to-designing-vuis.php">main features of the design of voice interfaces</a> . <br><br>  Each major platform has guidelines for designing interfaces for them: <br><br><ul><li>  <a href="https://developer.amazon.com/alexa-skills-kit/design">Amazon Alexa</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://designguidelines.withgoogle.com/conversation/">Google Assistant</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cortana/voice-commands/voicecommand-design-guidelines">Microsoft Cortana</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/ios/system-capabilities/siri/">Apple Siri</a> </li><li>  Yandex Alice.  There are no design guidelines yet, but there is <a href="https://tech.yandex.ru/dialogs/alice/doc/development-docpage/">general documentation</a> . </li></ul><br>  The Alexa ecosystem is best developed ‚Äî it has enough tools and interesting experiments (the platform has more than 50% of the market).  For example: <br><br><ul><li>  Online <a href="https://getstoryline.com/">Storyline</a> service to create skills. </li><li>  <a href="https://echosim.io/">Echoism</a> for their testing. </li><li>  Rafal Cymerys from Upside is showing the Alexa <a href="https://blog.upsidelab.io/design-voice-user-interface-starcraft/">StarCraft II voice control experiment</a> .  It is well suited for operations involving a sequence of several primitive actions, although basic operations are still easier to do through the mouse and keyboard. </li><li>  Enough <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018/06/22/jurassic-world-revealed-alexa-voice-game/">voice games and quests like Jurassic World</a> .  There are <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018/06/29/alexa-when-in-rome-board-game/">interesting combinations with desktop</a> .  And even <a href="https://www.polygon.com/e3/2018/6/11/17448080/skyrim-alexa-iphone-android-how-to-play">Skyrim is ironic</a> . </li></ul><br>  In late July, the hackathon on creating skills for Google Assistant ( <a href="https://russia.googleblog.com/2018/07/google.html">he spoke in Russian</a> ) was held in the Moscow office of Google.  The teams from Mail.Ru Group (Delivery Club, ICQ, Pandao, All pharmacies), Clever Pumpkin, Eora.ru, Heads and Hands, Just AI, Redmadrobot, Restri AO and X5 Retail Group participated in it.  The concepts themselves are secrets, but I‚Äôve got the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1GKPibWNAmgaj7v8wUgaOM_FyjaOjVjflVsd5ODEabDI/">criteria for evaluating a good skill</a> for you.  So to say, hot report :) You can experiment yourself through <a href="https://dialogflow.com/">Dialogflow</a> constructor. <br><br>  A bunch of recent news and relevant statistics can be found on the <a href="https://voicebot.ai/">Voicebot</a> website.  But just a couple of relatively fresh articles on the topic: <br><br><ul><li>  Several stand-up comedians appreciate the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018/06/26/siri-alexa-cortana-google-jokes/">humor of the smart assistants</a> Amazon Alexa, Apple Siri, Google Assistant, and Microsoft Cortana.  For example, Google has a separate team of writers who provide jokes. </li><li>  <a href="https://medium.com/nyc-design/smarter-parents-through-a-smart-baby-tracker-a-ux-ui-case-study-27331760f29e">The concept of voice assistant for young parents</a> from William Reano for inspiration. </li><li>  Jacky Li from the Connected Lab has done <a href="https://uxdesign.cc/why-touchscreens-dont-work-in-cars-69b6ff3d4355">some user research on how to control machine functions using a touch screen and voice</a> .  Touch screens obviously distract the driver.  But voice control is not better either (the <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/distracted-driving-ux/">recent article by the Nielsen / Norman Group gives specific reasons</a> ). </li><li>  <a href="https://www.toptal.com/designers/ui/designing-a-vui">Memo Frederik Goossens on the design of voice interfaces</a> . </li><li>  Over the past year and a half, there have appeared many devices like "voice assistant with a screen."  In fact, any tablet or smartphone with a docking station can solve this problem.  It seems that <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018/07/28/google-pixel-stand/">Google is preparing this mode for Android phones</a> . </li></ul><br>  This is just a small section of interesting and important pieces for the designer.
