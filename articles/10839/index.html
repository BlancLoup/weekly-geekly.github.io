How many doctors, how many medical workers in China ‚Äî people who have to make efforts to save lives ‚Äî are actually involved in the death industry? ‚Äù

      ‚ÄúWhat is the price of human life?  It seems that the Chinese government has involved itself in a process in which human organs are valued in dollars.  What a monstrous underestimation of human life.  What is the real price of a lost soul?  Each of those who lost a life?  Ruined lives, who else could live?  You can not rate.  That is why so many people are involved in it and make such efforts.  I hope that before the August 8 deadline, the Chinese government will realize that this must be stopped.  Human life cannot be estimated by the millions that the military and hospitals receive for organs they have extracted.  This is an unimaginable black spot on the Republic of China and will be recorded in a historical book.  They will not be able to hide it.  It will be recorded.  It would be much better if they wrote in historical books that the Chinese government put an end to the death industry, but it, however, continues to do this, hiding the facts. ‚Äù <br><br>  <strong>The Coalition to Investigate the Persecution of Falun Gong makes the following three demands to the Chinese Communist Party:</strong> <br><br>  1. Immediately stop the persecution of Falun Gong and release all followers imprisoned for their faith. <br><br>  2. Stop the persecution of friends, supporters and lawyers of Falun Gong practitioners (Gao Zhisheng, Li Hong, etc.). <br><br>  3. Conduct a discussion with the ICPPF in order to negotiate the opening of labor camps, prisons, hospitals and similar closed institutions in order to conduct an independent investigation organized by the ICPPF. <br><br>  David Matas and David Kilgour, authors of the ‚ÄúReport on the Verification of Allegations of the Removal of Internal Organs from Falun Gong Practitioners in China‚Äù, supported the initiative of the Communist Party of the Russian Federation. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/75e/77f/e6f/75e77fe6f215b525e217811c74a2f89a.jpg" width="450" height="337" hspace="10" vspace="10"><br>  Rabbi Dr. Reuven P. Balka, chairman of the CIPAE in Canada, said: ‚ÄúI wish there was no such situation, but it exists, and we have no choice but to resist it.  If we do not do this, and these atrocities continue, then we will have nothing to justify ourselves.  When our children learn that we were silent while committing such crimes, we will have nothing to say.  Therefore, everything that happens tells us: ‚ÄúRaise your voice in defense!  Do your best. ‚Äù <br><br>  The CIPFG, referring to Article 3 of the Olympic Charter, stated: ‚ÄúTo protect human dignity is the main task of the Olympic Games.  Wishing to get the right to host the 2008 Olympic Games, the Chinese authorities promised members of the International Olympic Committee (IOC) to improve the state of human rights in China in 2001.  However, recent reports by the UN and Amnesty International show that in recent years the human rights situation has actually deteriorated, and the Olympic Games have been used by the authorities as a tool for all kinds of persecutions.  In particular, Falun Gong practitioners are brutally attacked.  After July 20, 1999, when the communist regime launched a full-scale persecution of (followers) Falun Gong, in spite of a tough blockade of information, according to confirmed foreign reports, 3036 people died.  The UN Special Rapporteur, Manfred Novak, in March 2007 reported that Falun Gong practitioners make up 66% of the victims who were tortured while in state prisons. <br>  ‚ÄúSince March 2006, witnesses began to appear who claim that the communist regime created concentration camps, similar to the Nazi ones, which contain Falun Gong practitioners.  In these camps, organs were removed from a large number of living practitioners, and then their bodies were cremated. " <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/584/6db/c3b/5846dbc3b2f9e050c5d8410a33773cd0.jpg" width="450" height="337" hspace="10" vspace="10"><br>  Former Member of Parliament Simma Holt from Vancouver said: ‚ÄúI want to say the following: human rights, human rights violations and genocide are just words.  People do not understand that these words hide horrific stories, incomparable with what Dr. Mengele committed during the Holocaust.  He was a doctor of death.  There is nothing that can be compared with what is happening in China now, namely: the removal of organs from still living people and their sale.  A new report by Kilgour and Matas shows that the money is being funded by the army.  These operations are performed by military surgeons.  They put on their uniforms and then disappear.  It is difficult for us to even imagine this, but those 3,000 people know and, apparently, there are still thousands and thousands of those who have lost their body and their lives, and sometimes all that remains of them is only bones, which are then cremated.  David Matas and David Kilgour found such a witness.  This is a woman who was in the clinic.  Her husband was involved in the seizure of 2,000 corneas, as it became known for two years.  The people he operated on were alive, and other surgeons removed other parts of their bodies for sale, took blood tests from them, etc.  According to the witness, all this happened to healthy, normal, peaceful people who were declared criminals. ‚Äù <br><br>  Member of Parliament Boris Vrzhesnevsky said: ‚ÄúAs a Member of Parliament, I have certain opportunities and resources at my disposal.  One of them is the establishment of legislation.  I will work with representatives of other parties, Members of Parliament from other parties, to promote an article on this problem in the legislation in order to make sure that none of the Canadians got involved in this death industry that we see in China today ... People are extraordinary are interested in doing everything so that this horror that is happening today in the PRC, was stopped.  And we have such a unique opportunity in the light of the approach of the Olympic Games, to highlight this problem and bring it to the fore, and to convince the Chinese government to put an end to this terrifying industry. ‚Äù <br><br>  Dr. Thorsten Trey said at a press conference: ‚ÄúThe practice of extracting organs is against ethical standards, the Doctors Against Organ Harvest organization believes that the global medical community supports this.  The current situation is an ominous reminder of the holding of the Olympic Games in the summer of 1936 in Berlin, which were used by the Nazi party as a cover for spreading their ideology and at the same time preparing for the Holocaust. ‚Äù <br><br>  He continued: ‚ÄúOur organization believes that, given the current human rights situation in China, supporting and facilitating the Olympic Games in Beijing will be contrary to the true spirit of the Olympic movement.  Physicians of the world must protest resolutely against these inhuman crimes in the field of medicine.  Therefore, until the end of organ harvesting is confirmed, the Doctors Against Organ Harvesting organization joins the international coalition to call for a boycott of the 2008 Olympic Games. ‚Äù <br><br>  <u>Additional Information</u> <br><br>  CIPFG consists of more than 300 world-famous names, and also contains four delegations from Australia, Asia, Europe and North America.  Investigating allegations of CPC-sanctioned organ harvesting from living people for profit, the CIPFG intends to uncover the facts of the persecution, stop it and bring the criminals to justice. <br><br>  The head of the CIPFG Australia is Andrew Bartlett, a member of the Federal Parliament. <br><br>  The head of the CIPFG Europe is Baroness Caroline Cox (Caroline Cox), the UK Senator. <br><br>  The head of the CIPFG Asia is Lei Ching-te (Lai Ching-te), a doctor from Taiwan. <br><br>  The members of the CIPFG of North America are members of Congress, famous scientists, doctors and lawyers. <br><br>  Source: <a href="http://www.minghui.org/mh/articles/2007/5/31/155961.html">www.minghui.org/mh/articles/2007/5/31/155961.html</a> <br><br>  Kilgour / Matas <a href="http://organharvestinvestigation.net/report0607/report060706-ru.pdf">Report organharvestinvestigation.net/report0607/report060706-en.pdf</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/10839/">https://habr.com/ru/post/10839/</a></p>
