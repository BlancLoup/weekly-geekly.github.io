Such relationships allow companies to combine their strongest sides and direct these forces to achieve maximum results in their activities.  BILLmanager provides the opportunity to develop several options for partnerships.  Among them - various referral and reseller programs. <br><br>  Referral programs are a fairly cheap way to popularize your services with a company by attracting your own clients.  It looks like this: a company that provides certain services gives its customers special referral links to their website or a set of promotional codes.  Customers of this company distribute the received links and promo codes among their customers, readers, friends and acquaintances in various ways - be it mail, a link to a website, a banner, social networks or something else.

      For example: <a name="habracut"></a>  a certain online music and film store sells media content.  And the owners of this store offer thematic blogs, journalists, and other people associated with this topic (and even their own customers!) To participate in the store's referral program.  These people are registered in the program and receive a special link, or a promotional code containing a unique identifier.  Then they are required to make so that as many people as possible register with this link or code.  They post them on their website, on various forums, blogs, send them to friends and acquaintances, etc., thus bringing new customers to the store. <br><br>  Visitors registering on such links and codes can receive certain predetermined discounts during their first purchases.  And those people whose links came from these clients will be charged a certain percentage of the money spent by the new client.  Thus, the referral program is a mutually beneficial offer for a company seeking to popularize its products or services, as well as for current customers of this company who would like to receive bonuses and discounts, and perhaps even have additional profits by attracting new customers . <br><br>  If you use BILLmanager billing system in your work to communicate with clients and would like to use the advantages of referral systems for the benefit of your company, then I can please you - in order to organize your own partner system you will not need to take almost any additional actions.  Creating a new referral program occurs in a few mouse clicks.  And after a few minutes your customers will be able to take part in the promotion of your service. <br><br>  What you get: <br><ul><li>  cheap and high-quality advertising among the target audience relevant to you </li><li>  the expansion of the customer base </li><li>  increase in sales </li></ul><br>  What do your customers get: <br><ul><li>  discounts on your services </li><li>  possibility of additional income </li></ul><br>  Moreover, using BILLmanager you can create different referral programs for different groups of clients, types of services, indicating different types of bonuses.  In this way, you can build entire referral networks that will bring the maximum number of existing customers to the business of advertising your services.  BILLmanager undertakes most of the work for automating the maintenance of statistics, calculating expenses, paying bonuses and much more.  You just have to determine the size of bonuses received by customers, and the types of services for which advertising, they will receive these bonuses. <br><br>  In addition to referral programs, BILLmanager provides a convenient platform for direct resale of products and services.  You can connect your BILLmanager with your partner‚Äôs BILLmanager billing system, import its tariff plans and, along with your services, resell your partner‚Äôs products to your customers.  This will allow you to receive certain pre-specified bonuses from a partner (for example, discounts on further purchases of its products) and popularize its products / services among its customers. <br><br>  As an example, consider the following situation: your company is engaged in the provision of virtual and VPS hosting services.  Sometimes your customers turn to the sales department asking about the possibility of renting a dedicated server.  They are already "closely" on the virtual server, and for the development of their resources, a fully-fledged dedicated server is required.  But renting (and especially buying) dedicated servers is quite expensive, paying off only on large volumes and after a certain time.  Therefore, in such cases, it makes sense to simply outbid the server from a larger business partner that provides dedicated servers.  This partner can provide bonuses when buying or renting a certain number of servers.  In such a case, the partnership scheme may look like this: for each leased server, the discount for further lease agreements is increased by one percent.  In this way: <br><ul><li>  You have not rented a single server - there are no discounts. </li><li>  rent 1 server - 1% discount on the purchase of the second </li><li>  rent 2 servers - 2% discount on the purchase of the third and 1% on the renewal of servers </li><li>  rent 3 servers - 3% discount on the purchase of the fourth and 2% on the renewal of servers </li><li>  .................. </li><li>  15 servers - 15% discount </li></ul><br>  The types and sizes of bonuses, of course, are stipulated in advance and may be different.  This will allow finding the most beneficial forms of cooperation for both parties.  For the final client, everything will look as if he is buying the server directly from you - directly and simply. <br><br>  If you do not have the opportunity to buy and deploy a full-fledged billing system, then BILLmanager has something to offer for this case.  Your partner can provide you with the opportunity to use his own billing system.  Everything looks quite simple - in the billing of the partner you are allocated a separate section, which you can link to your own domain.  Moreover, through this section you can distribute not only the products of your partner, but also your own.  For the end client, this will look like a separate, independent billing system.  In this way, you can also get a convenient platform for selling / reselling products and services, and your partner gets an assistant in distributing his products. <br><br>  If you have any questions about setting up affiliate programs, you can always read our documentation or contact support.  We will be happy to help deal with all the difficulties! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/158395/">https://habr.com/ru/post/158395/</a></p>
