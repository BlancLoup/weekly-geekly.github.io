Every year technologies developed and became more perfect, new ways of printing appeared - you can read an excellent <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259F%25D1%2580%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BD%25D1%2582%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580">article</a> on Wikipedia about all this :) <br><br>  A decade ago, the printer at home was a sign of good prosperity - inkjet printers were often almost in the most visible place and printed a couple of sheets a week - the owners with an enviable constancy worrying about the level of ink and in every way saved on print quality.  Or have you ever heard your question ‚Äú <i>Do not print the report?</i>  <i>Pages forty there ...</i> "abstract rumbling?  ) Some proudly printed for the first time, and the second time they said, they say ‚Äúsomething doesn‚Äôt work‚Äù - it seems like the conscience is clear and you don‚Äôt waste your time on paint)) <br><br>  Now everything has changed, you will not surprise anyone with a printer - the competitive struggle of industry leaders (Epson, Canon, HP, Brother and Lexmark - they own 97% of the market of inkjet printers) made them more accessible than ever - for a couple of thousand rubles you can take a printer that will satisfy all "home" requests.  Packs can print not only color text, but also photos - cartridges cost a penny, the choice of photo devices is huge - come to the store, choose.

      Stop!  Cartridges for a penny?  Hmm ... about a year ago, I bought a wonderful <b>Samsung ML-1630</b> laser printer for study - it cost something like 5,000 rubles.  And everything seems to be good ... but I found a buried dog, only by printing a pack of paper - new toner cartridges for him cost 3,000 rubles (!) With a 2,000 page resource!  Yes, even though I was going to talk about the streamers, the sediment remained! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/bab/868/c87/bab868c8792b478dcafc904fa29ce954.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  So, in the market of inkjet printers about the same situation - sometimes for cheap and __ device hides expensive consumables and maintenance.  For manufacturers, this is a natural process - in competitive races, it is necessary to ‚Äúpee-dug‚Äù each time colleagues, releasing more and more technically advanced devices, ‚Äúbeating off‚Äù money on cartridges later.  The analogy is if car manufacturers sell cars for $ 30 apiece, and the fuel they drive is $ 1000.  And the volume of the cartridge in each new model of printer or MFP does not seem to grow. <br>  For us, mere mortals, this is an excellent scheme of ‚Äúdivorce‚Äù - in the store we pay attention to anything - to the quality of the issued image, to speed and noise, to all kinds of small screens and other checkers ... but not to the cartridge resource and its replacement.  And the seller is silent as a partisan - in order to sell more, so that in a month or two you will return to him.  Well, if you are an advanced IT user or a person who is just keen on printing photos, you naturally read reviews beforehand, find the price of one print on a piece of paper at the price of a cartridge and the print settings you need, look at the stores of online stores and the price of consumables with a perspective on near future ... but if everyone did so. <br><br>  And users began to think ... more precisely, other companies began to think about them (different from printer manufacturers, of course).  These same companies began to come up with alternative ways that they seem to make life easier for the simple user. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a4a/4a2/532/a4a4a2532cda96e2bcb6195e95f36546.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h2>  SSNP? </h2><br>  Let's say the cost of one cartridge for a printer is $ 25-30 and on average it contains 7-8 ml of ink.  It turns out, ~ 4 $ for one ml, while the market price of ink in the bank (but the highest quality) is about $ 30 per 1000 ml (but not $ 4000).  It was this advantage that at one time became the impetus for the development of non-original consumables. <br><br>  Perhaps, all sorts of ‚Äúsoftpacks‚Äù became the prototype of the solution to the problem - small boxes for different models of printers that contain syringes-containers with the desired paint.  To extend the life of the cartridge, the user was asked to refill it at his own risk through these same syringes.  What is the percentage of equipment failure after such operations - I do not know, but for me, pah-pah, everything always worked.  I, by the way, remember more of the situations when I had to ‚Äúrevive‚Äù a dried cartridge, due to its inactive use.  You used to sit with a rag and a bottle of distilled water, all in paint ‚Äî you rub the nozzle to a mirror-like shine, and during a test run, some color still doesn‚Äôt wake up.  It was possible to conjure whole evenings. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/79d/fb3/a31/79dfb3a317160810d0318b5cf124b474.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Technologies did not stand still - manufacturers began to make cartridges with all kinds of chips, which, for example, due to irreversible processes, made re-filling impossible.  And since there is no absolute protection even in the world of inkjet printer cartridges - the market reacted to this rather quickly, starting to produce cartridges identical to the original ones.  For the price, they were 3-5 times cheaper than the genuine ones, but they were still not very intensive and still without any guarantees. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/854/0ec/b17/8540ecb17c91e6339eee55daa6833b88.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Engineering minds did not sleep, thought day and night ... and as a result came up with.  This time, the <b>technology of continuous ink supply</b> (abbreviated as <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A1%25D0%259D%25D0%259F%25D0%25A7">CISS</a> or Continuous Ink Supply Systems, CISS) began to gain momentum.  It cannot be said that it has changed everything radically - syringes and containers still remained ... At first, these were all kinds of tubes, connected by tubes and tape with homemade ‚Äúdroppers‚Äù, now these are serial products of large companies produced in factories and for which they give guarantees.  In short, life seems to be easier and I would like to tell a little about it. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/9f0/988/b99/9f0988b99d841c9537e8094c578147e1.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h2>  Arbeiten </h2><br>  The device and principle of operation of the CISP does not constitute anything complicated and practically does not differ from the original device: large tanks are installed outside the printer, the inks of which are fed to the print heads along a thin silicone trail.  Everything. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/bcd/b90/af1/bcdb90af1e3b9dc49391e367975fea38.jpg" alt="image"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/d5b/a96/0f9/d5ba960f9da357e87055ab49e8269191.jpg" alt="image"><br>  What is the gain?  Well, at least in the volume of the tanks - you can print longer without worrying that it‚Äôs time to change something.  Secondly, volumes are always visible and you can refill any of the flowers independently of others.  In the third - the price, about which a little later. <br>  Those.  we have the same printer (multifunction printer or plotter), but with a little modified cartridges - after the ink is finished, no replacement is required, all you need is to add ink like gasoline to the car. <br><br><iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/5oy2Y9lG3So%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,1500004,15700021,15700043,15700186,15700191,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhgIROVgbYd94eNPZso9rg0-2dF1gg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  As you can see, there is no acceleration or deceleration of the printing process, although the resource of the print head may increase - there is no ‚Äúgravity‚Äù in the face of the cartridge and there are no periodic actions to replace something. <br><br>  Refueling such a system is not much different from the fuss that was before.  The same syringe, the same jars ... but the difference is that now the paint should not be ‚Äúinjected‚Äù blindly into the cartridge (when you can‚Äôt guess it was poured or underfilled), but into a transparent container (you can even just pour it, without any syringes).  Actually, the ink consumption is estimated using the same containers and, if necessary, refills the desired color. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/BdOmIM6KlH4&amp;xid=17259,1500004,15700021,15700043,15700186,15700191,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhgsQ5mbq7jWu9vOE3-485MLuiMLQQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><h2>  Broken calculator </h2><br>  Suppose a single black cartridge (8 ml) is enough to print 1000 sheets of text at 5% coverage.  For ease of calculation, we take the price of such a cartridge at $ 30, and the dollar exchange rate for 30 rubles. <br>  In the CISS sets, the volume of the ink bottle is usually 100 ml for each color.  That is, a 6-color printer - 600 ml, and 4-color - 400 ml.  Even if the ‚Äúdose‚Äù when refilling is not 8, but 10 ml, 10,000 sheets of text will be printed.  If you use ink at an average price of $ 5 per 100 ml, the cost of one copy, excluding the price of paper, will be 5 / 10,000 = $ 0.0005 (0.015 rubles = one and a half kopecks). <br>  In order to print the same amount of text when using original cartridges, they will need 10 pieces ($ 300), which amounts to $ 0.03 per page (90 kopecks).  Savings - 60 times, with equal print quality (judging by the video. Or are they bullshit?). <br><br><iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/nOyGwXPd4c4%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,1500004,15700021,15700043,15700186,15700191,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhjTdPIJQKsyt0r7r5I4E-n8seugbA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  The calculations are extremely approximate - the cost of the CISS itself was not taken into account.  Yes, and if you print pictures, the cost of paper will be the main expense item ... but saving on the paint even 2 times - ALREADY savings.  You can calculate the actual savings for your printer yourself, relying on the price of a new cartridge and CISS system, the price of which can be found in the internet (for example, on <a href="http://originalam.net/">this</a> site) <br><br>  It is logical to assume that manufacturers do not like such a knight's move - so there is nothing surprising in the fact that they are trying to protect the printing mechanism in every possible way and will deprive you of warranty service in any convenient way.  On the other hand, the printer will pay off very soon, even if you do not extract commercial gain from its work. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/ead/132/2fb/ead1322fb178fa15ad84c7482a163026.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h2>  Pros and cons? </h2><br>  <b>Original cartridges</b> <br>  <u>Pros</u> : <br>  - The print quality that the manufacturer ‚Äúdesigned‚Äù; <br>  - The possibility of warranty service <br>  - A clear conscience. <br><br>  <u>Cons</u> : <br>  - High price; <br>  - A small amount of ink tanks; <br>  - The need to interrupt printing when replacing the cartridge; <br>  - If the cartridge is whole, then it will have to be changed completely, even if only one color has ended. <br><br>  <b>CISS - Continuous Ink Supply Systems</b> <br>  <u>Pros</u> : <br>  - Ability to replenish the volume of ink in accordance with their real consumption; <br>  - Print quality is similar to the original; <br>  - Low cost system and consumables; <br>  - A large amount of ink tanks; <br>  - The possibility of continuous printing. <br><br>  <u>Cons</u> : <br>  - Terrible appearance) the complexity of transporting the printer when installed CISS; <br>  - There is a chance to lose warranty service. <br><br>  With regard to appearance - CISS are completely unsightly containers, which are ‚Äúblack sheep‚Äù stick out of the printer.  If I had such a unit - I would have dived in every possible way) <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/d58/337/9af/d583379af1a595b1e71dd006b680de20.jpg" alt="image"><br><h2>  Verdict </h2><br>  <i>Lazily people wander around the malls,</i> <i><br></i>  <i>For a ruble with something, the technique is taken at interest.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>It would have gone, just would not have swelled the brain with fat ...</i> <i><br></i>  <i>To whom it is hard - hold on, I wish peace!</i> <br><br>  The lyrics of one of the songs from the last Caste album  If you think - really ... marketers will not think of anything.  Some come up with the pitfalls in the devices themselves, others - when selling them.  And many people are blindly doing this, thinking ‚Äú <i>yes, what is it, all the printers are the same, why should I overpay</i> ‚Äù. <br>  A ‚Äúgood printer‚Äù can really be bought at a very affordable price.  Another question - what it will pour out later, with active use.  And if you‚Äôve managed to get caught, it is possible that these very CISS will help you to get out.  Another question is that they do not exist for every printer and it would be better to think it over in advance :) Obviously, this is a very profitable investment.  Well, or buy a printer / MFP immediately with the established CISS, the benefit of such offers on the market too. <br>  Now manufacturers are struggling with the "foreign body in their bodies", complicating the design of the covers and making it difficult to access the printing mechanism - it seems that soon printers will look like black boxes :) However, time will tell. <br><br>  Or what else to expect?  ) <br>  My <a href="http://twitter.com/Boomburum">twitter</a> <br>  <b>Successes</b> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/76927/">https://habr.com/ru/post/76927/</a></p>
