  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Kindle Fire HDX - affordable tablet from Amazon</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  In 2011, Amazon shook the tablet market, launching a $ 200 Kindle Fire, while competitors offered models with similar characteristics much more expensive.  A year later, Amazon again surprised everyone by releasing two new tablets at once: the Kindle Fire HD and the Kindle Fire HD 8.9.  At a cost of $ 200 and $ 300, they had a fairly powerful stuffing for those measures.  Now the story is repeated again, but with the Kindle Fire HDX in the lead role.  It is impossible to say that a revolution occurred, but the company offered devices with top-end features for the price of budget tablets. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/291/0b5/498/2910b5498372212504ba6345ac7d2b3a.jpg"><br><br>  Where does such a relatively small price come from?  The fact is that the online store Amazon sells devices "at cost", only covers the cost of their manufacture.  An aggressive pricing policy contributes to the company's main goal: to ensure that as many tablets as possible reach users who are potential buyers of Amazon's online content, from games and books to video. <br>  <i>‚ÄúWe want to make money when people use our devices, not when they buy them</i> ,‚Äù says Jeffrey Beezos (head and founder of the Internet company). <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  <font color="ff9c00">‚ñå</font> <font color="000000">TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS</font> </h2><br>  The tablet is built on the latest Qualcomm MSM8974 (Snapdragon 800) platform with a 2.26 GHz quad-core processor, the graphics subsystem (GPU) is Adreno 330. The Fire HDX has 2 GB of RAM and 16 GB of internal memory for storing user data.  Sold models with a version of 32 GB, as well as with support for LTE networks.  Due to the use of magnesium alloy for the body of the new tablet has a relatively small weight.

Below on the front side of the package are various icons that describe the main advantages of the tablet. <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/5b0/f0d/f1e/5b0f0df1ed870e55ee61c51f2a0a1065.jpg" alt="image"></a> <br><br>  On the reverse side we see a detailed description of all the advantages of the device - a high-resolution display, a powerful processor and access to various content. <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/530/727/cf0/530727cf07b98a99c1d8bc37054662df.jpg" alt="image"></a> <br><br>  The packaging of the device looks externally standard for the Kindle product series.  It is a black painted cardboard of a characteristic shape, on which one can easily find a place to open a sealed box. <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ec3/27b/cf4/ec327bcf48ee514abc732b154fec1661.jpg" alt="image"></a> <br><br>  Inside the package, you will find a 7-inch tablet, an insert with instructions, a charger (1 A), and a USB-Micro-USB connection cable.  No headphones in the kit were found, and no other accessories were found - everything is very concise. <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/0d6/ba3/07a/0d6ba307a0cb586dfc8e90cf6bab2ac5.jpg" alt="image"></a> <br><br>  In addition to the tablet, you can purchase original Origami covers in leather ($ 65) or polyurethane ($ 50) design.  These durable covers in the form of a cover with a lid protect from scratches and bumps, and can also function as a stand with different angles of inclination.  With the help of built-in magnets, the device can automatically unlock when opened. <br><br><h2>  <font color="ffd800">‚ñå</font> <font color="000000">DESIGN, DIMENSIONS, CONTROL ELEMENTS</font> </h2><br>  On the front panel you will not find any inscription or buttons.  The entire front of the tablet is covered with glass.  The front camera, suitable only for Skype, is located in the center.  The light sensor took its place on the left.  A built-in dual microphone is located above the camera at the top of the device.  The front surface is black, in standby mode, the frame merges with the display, and a monochromatic plane is obtained. <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/463/e42/83d/463e4283d770055c26a20d99d4965464.jpg" alt="image"></a> <br><br>  The entire rear panel, as well as the sides of the device, are made of rubberized plastic.  With it, the device fits well in the hand.  The brilliant manufacturer's logo of immodest size is located in the middle.  A decorative glossy plate, which standardly stains during the very first hours of work with the tablet, closes the upper part of the tablet. <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/384/7d2/c5b/3847d2c5bc15a0df5d90f97aad58ff09.jpg" alt="image"></a> <br><br>  On the right side are the volume rocker.  In order to change the volume on the tablet, you do not need to frantically search with your fingers for the corresponding key on the narrow one from the gadget, in this case it is located under the fingers of your right hand (if you hold the tablet horizontally). <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ad4/672/3e6/ad46723e64df6e8f22ddfd40d4e44b53.jpg" alt="image"></a> <br><br>  The power button is located under the fingers of the left hand.  The "Volume" and "Enable" buttons are almost recessed into the device case and feel almost the same as the surface. <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/28e/71c/5d1/28e71c5d10f2ea334ac237c9d71b2985.jpg" alt="image"></a> <br><br>  The microUSB connector is on a very narrow sidewall. <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a42/052/6f3/a420526f304ad3b00b22d29d40877143.jpg" alt="image"></a> <br><br>  On the opposite side there is a 3.5 mm jack.  If the headphones used have a ‚ÄúG‚Äù shape plug, then they will not overlap the ‚ÄúVolume‚Äù buttons. <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/71e/c1c/4d5/71ec1c4d53ff968d20f275480139fd9d.jpg" alt="image"></a> <br><br>  The Kindle Fire HDX has an excellent speaker system, as well as a software system for automatically detecting distortions and urgently correcting recording errors before playback, with the result that you get a clear, clear and balanced sound.  The speakers here are spaced apart at different edges of the device and have stereo sound.  Even at maximum volume, the tablet does not distort the sound.  The Kindle Fire uses Dolby Digital Plus, a world-class system without the use of headphones.  Although the sound in the headphones also does not disappoint. <br><br><h2>  <font color="ff0000">‚ñå</font> <font color="000000">CAMERAS</font> </h2><br>  The front camera has a resolution of 1.2 megapixels and performs its work at a decent level and is well suited for communication in Skype. <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e87/7a2/4ed/e877a24ed815cd43d1a51e4c543d35af.jpg" alt="image"></a> <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/bc8/52c/005/bc852c00574a3fdf67c0a6ee64b4e1ca.jpg" alt="image"></a> <br><br>  In addition, she is able to shoot video in HD resolution. <br><br><h2>  <font color="00a8ff">‚ñå</font> <font color="000000">DISPLAY</font> </h2><br>  The tablet has a display with a resolution of 1920x1200 with a diagonal of 7 "(323PPI) with 100% sRGB color reproduction. <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/200/b0b/25d/200b0b25d87c02149b07579bf8fb841c.jpg" alt="image"></a> <br><br>  The display has a very high quality oleophobic coating, thanks to which it is slapped with fingers somewhat less than expected. <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/aca/fa8/29e/acafa829ea9c220e8a074f3aa2c1a79a.jpg" alt="image"></a> <br><br>  Viewing angles are expected to be excellent (IPS is peculiar), colors are juicy, but natural. <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/5c8/a2e/475/5c8a2e475d0059147e5785b458a5cc6b.jpg" alt="image"></a> <br><br>  The margin of brightness is very good: in normal mode, you can use the device with 50% brightness. <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/3dc/749/265/3dc749265ef1cb63056a309598f39dea.jpg" alt="image"></a> <br><br>  <a href="http://www.displaymate.com/Tablet_ShootOut_4.htm">DisplayMate</a> experts consider the Kindle Fire HDX 7 screen to be slightly better than the Nexus 7 and iPad Mini Retina.  Its production uses the technology of so-called "quantum dots" Quantum Dots. <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/716/946/e35/716946e354b53ae3e8a434af394a09c4.jpg" alt="image"></a> <br><br>  The color scheme is almost the same: 97% for the Kindle Fire HDX and 103% for the Nexus 7 2013. <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/29a/11f/14b/29a11f14ba3d82ef19c6f13dbb8fb6cf.jpg" alt="image"></a> <br><br>  In general, the difference between the Nexus 7 and Kindle Fire HDX displays in everyday use is difficult to notice. <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/031/e04/3be/031e043be49e9b553d485a16f6b55635.jpg" alt="image"></a> <br><br>  <i>To achieve perfect color accuracy on the Kindle Fire HDX 7 "with the lowest possible battery consumption and device weight, engineers used blue LEDs instead of white ones.

The Fire OS changed the interface and contained a number of low-level transformations.  But at the same time, compatibility with Android applications is fully preserved. <br>  The desktop is made in the carousel style, which offers the user the most used applications.  Above the carousel is a menu that allows you to launch various services from Amazon, such as Books, Apps, Music, Video and of course the application to view the giant Amazon catalog. <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/cc7/0dd/6ce/cc70dd6ce8554c965913fab680eb6c84.png" alt="image"></a> <br><br>  A gesture up the carousel will bring up the screen of all installed applications on the system. <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/934/279/b83/934279b83dd731a52537f3ce89215573.png" alt="image"></a> <br><br>  Since there are no hardware buttons in the Kindle Fire HDX, they are emulated on the screen and are on the right side of the screen.  Unlike Android stock, there is a Search button that opens a search bar in an open application. <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/3ba/995/943/3ba995943e8b62ce92998e1ff84b73ee.png" alt="image"></a> <br><br>  If you hold your fingers to the left of the edge of the screen, then the icons of recent applications will open.  So you can switch quickly between applications, multitasking of a kind ... <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/7a1/f9f/ead/7a1f9fead0de218719cd3571f6e6f55b.png" alt="image"></a> <br><br>  The status bar displays the device name, time, as well as icons of various modules, and of the battery, which can be displayed as a percentage.  Pulling the line from the edge of the screen you will get access to the control panel, where you can block the automatic change of the position of the interface, adjust the brightness or Wi-Fi, as well as go to the full settings mode.  In addition, you can call the operator from the support or disable all notifications.  And of course, the status bar displays all notifications received from installed programs. <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ebb/6be/af5/ebb6beaf50819ecc56530962f177defe.png" alt="image"></a> <br><br>  Amazon Kindle Fire HDX is available in two versions: with advertising (With Special Offers) and without advertising (Without Special Offers).  The price is different and the difference lies in displaying ads on the lock screen. <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/039/a79/81c/039a7981cc6cd8cc91430fcc544e5cc9.png" alt="image"></a> <br><br>  Advertising changes all the time each time the device wakes up.  To be honest, it does not interfere at all.  Sometimes advertise quite interesting gadgets, promotions and movies with music. <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ce1/68c/18c/ce168c18c8891b67e3057ee4ff50f9a0.png" alt="image"></a> <br><br>  Banners are shown in high quality and look like simple wallpapers.  It's even a bit cool that your device always meets you with a new interesting picture. <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d14/9e6/110/d149e6110dfb3ff6c6ab4c5b23d2d740.png" alt="image"></a> <br><br>  If you liked any offer, but you have already blocked the device and the ad is gone, then do not worry.  A list of all stocks is in the special Offers section on the main screen.  But many people still do not like advertising ... It does not matter!  Can be deleted using Superuser rights. <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/fb1/f40/73f/fb1f4073f282c8787d1f3a2b21634900.png" alt="image"></a> <br><br>  As you probably already noticed, the interface on the tablet is in English.  In principle, it is intuitive, problems with the use of the device should arise. <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/5f1/c84/acd/5f1c84acddfef38bbee2c239e6840f74.png" alt="image"></a> <br><br>  For everything else, you can put <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details%3Fid%3Djp.co.c_lis.ccl.morelocale%26hl%3Dru">MoreLocale 2</a> .  Then all new applications will think that the Russian language is installed in the system and will be included in its interface. <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/fb8/cb9/233/fb8cb92335ee1e3e4a651c63d7a9593a.png" alt="image"></a> <br><br>  But by default, you can turn on the Russian keyboard. <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e6e/98d/d07/e6e98dd0783fb952f61f9d3e2a9fabb8.png" alt="image"></a> <br><br>  The keyboard supports Swype - text input method without removing your finger / stylus from the "keyboard buttons" on the touch screen.  There is also a built-in dictionary of Russian words. <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/cfd/561/f95/cfd561f95177f0e53431a15e3b1ca3ed.png" alt="image"></a> <br><br>  A huge disadvantage for Fire OS is the lack of Google applications.  According to the usual Gmail client or Google+ service you will not find.  And new applications are not available in the Play Store, but in the Amazon Appstore. <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/433/4cc/7e7/4334cc7e7cb9be9fbde8178a9b3bb9ba.png" alt="image"></a> <br><br>  The list of applications is certainly not richer than in the Market, but the main popular applications are present. <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c04/942/02a/c0494202af2e9acdbec9605b720c6fa4.png" alt="image"></a> <br><br>  Amazon Appstore has almost the same functionality.  There are reviews and ratings, automatic updates, recommendations and other features. <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ec4/24b/373/ec424b3734aed4171a9c41d744963a98.png" alt="image"></a> <br><br>  Amazon's proprietary chip is the Test Drive feature, which allows you to run an application without installing it!  The launch is carried out by a powerful cloud service from Amazon.  By clicking Test Drive, you launch an emulator window in which you can try out all the functions of the application you want to buy! <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/050/d2f/4df/050d2f4dfb321a7c89941803edbfd5ed.png" alt="image"></a> <br><br>  If there are not enough necessary applications in the native store, then you can run any Android applications without any problems.  In addition, you can install alternative markets, such as <a href="http://4pda.ru/forum/index.php%3Fshowtopic%3D275433">App &amp; Game</a> <a href="http://4pda.ru/forum/index.php%3Fshowtopic%3D215163">w3bsit3-dns.com</a> or <a href="http://4pda.ru/forum/index.php%3Fshowtopic%3D215163">Blackmart</a> . <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/5dd/eed/ac9/5ddeedac9dd8a37ea931bd35683ea1b0.png" alt="image"></a> <br><br>  Amazon has its own music service.  You can listen to a piece of the song or buy the full version, leave a response, or purchase a whole artist album.  The store represents almost all leading recording studios, television companies, performers and other copyright holders.  Therefore, there is a wide choice of content that can satisfy the needs of any user. <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/8fa/43e/96c/8fa43e96c995264b6d32cf1a299c262b.png" alt="image"></a> <br><br>  In addition, Amazon Instant Video streaming video service is available to you.  It allows users to purchase movies, TV shows and videos, and then view them on computers, laptops, tablets, smartphones and other mobile devices. <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d56/368/a12/d56368a127625cd968bed496fc684bf9.png" alt="image"></a> <br><br>  You can buy each movie or TV show separately, or purchase Amazon Prime unlimited access for $ 79 / year.  Inexpensive, right? <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/98f/d15/f72/98fd15f72e0964873a328774e3e09f83.png" alt="image"></a> <br><br>  And of course you can look through the magazines, where are they ;-). <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b65/da6/cdc/b65da6cdc9cad4fd0749ab9a513b87e4.png" alt="image"></a> <br><br>  Amazon integrated the Goodreads service, which they themselves recently acquired earlier this year, in the Kindle Fire HDX.  Using the app, you can evaluate the books that you read, see what your friends are reading, and share quotes and thoughts directly with your Goodreads buddies.  Here's how Goodreads can be used on your Fire HDX, besides the standard reader functions. <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/fef/cae/2be/fefcae2be2d411b763ef7f776acc6a45.png" alt="image"></a> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/936/3b8/029/9363b8029d65d63a9a6e4486457ea799.png" alt="image"></a> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/947/0ab/93b/9470ab93b59e5d08579c7e1abf15f038.png" alt="image"></a> <br><br>  One of the useful functions of the tablet is the Kindle FreeTime parental control, which allows you to limit the time children spend with the tablet for specific applications, such as surfing, watching videos, using applications or reading. <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/344/250/6c0/3442506c034a1ea29b7950d2e56cb870.png" alt="image"></a> <br><br>  Another advantage of the tablet is the Mayday function, which allows you to get free technical support at any time.  Amazon ensures that as soon as you click on the Mayday button, within 15 seconds you will receive live support from a technician who will help you with any problem with the tablet or services.  An assistant can draw hints right on your screen, where you need to click or go to solve this or that problem.  Amazon also claims that this feature will be available 24/7 and 365 days a year, which takes service and support to a whole new level. <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/61b/438/a80/61b438a80a40514b96d9392b1448fecc.png" alt="image"></a> <br><br>  Indeed, support responds quickly, welcomes you and is interested in the problem.  By the way, the operator does not see you, but you see him and it is much more pleasant to talk to the person you see.  Personally, they helped me with the problem, although my English does not shine with eloquence, but the operator understood and helped me.  Moreover, when I stopped understanding some of his words, he took out a tablet and began to simply show visually what I needed to do with the device.  After that, the problem was solved!  Of course, Mayday is unlikely to be useful for an experienced user, but for less technically savvy users, this is definitely a find. <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c78/8f6/92c/c788f692cb6ecd3d8a99817e3eef7aad.png" alt="image"></a> <br><br>  There are no comments on the speed of the interface itself, everything works not just quickly, but reactively.  This is facilitated by a powerful filling and optimized OS Fire 3.1.  A key feature is the depth of integration of the device with all its services.  The Amazon book store is always one click away from the reader.  For reading electronic books there is the Goodread application.  The music player is Amazon MP3.  Movie Player - Amazon Instant Player.  App Store - Amazon Appstore. <br><br><h2>  <font color="9000ff">‚ñå</font> <font color="000000">TESTING IN BENCHMARKS</font> </h2><br>  Compared with the previous generation model, the novelty has become more productive three times.  Thanks to its powerful stuffing, the Kindle Fire HDX is easy to use.  This is one of the few Android tablets that boasts a smooth interface animation even with several open applications.  During the use of the device there was not even a hint of brakes. <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/df4/564/8ca/df45648caf10e0efe4f61f12a5cc36c2.png" alt="image"></a> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e0f/e20/4ff/e0fe204ff81558f016e90fb9db7c5f99.png" alt="image"></a> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/280/21d/840/28021d8409230623be35ca0d5e5280e6.png" alt="image"></a> <br><br>  In AnTuTu Benchmark tablet scored 35011 points.  The diagram shows that the Kindle Fire HDX has bypassed all the top devices today. <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/2c0/e85/a64/2c0e85a6486037634779fbea04fdfb0f.png" alt="image"></a> <br><br>  The results in Geekbench 3 - 918 (single core) and 2836 (multi-core mode). <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/898/228/213/8982282134c780741bf3f5a6ee958b02.png" alt="image"></a> <br><br>  An idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe graphics performance is given by the test results in the 3DMark package.  The Ice Storm Unlimited test results look like this: <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/9e7/08c/2de/9e708c2de7029a68e787b3a9eaf70d9a.png" alt="image"></a> <br><br>  The tablet turns on in less than thirty seconds and wakes up from sleep mode instantly when you press the power button.  The heaviest applications load quickly and run smoothly. <br><br><h2>  <font color="ff0000">‚ñå</font> <font color="000000">GAMES</font> </h2><br>  The tablet of course copes with any games today with the maximum graphics settings. <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ba8/aa1/cc8/ba8aa1cc8e447e0d80de704671fcc49c.png" alt="image"></a> <br><br>  And even the high resolution of the display does not allow the device to brake. <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c7e/54b/5d3/c7e54b5d3ed56e6799b8d6cb7f01599b.png" alt="image"></a> <br><br>  Simple toys also work flawlessly. <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/651/3f5/8ac/6513f58acb7e0b77bec2597c97711e20.png" alt="image"></a> <br><br>  There are no compatibility issues.  You can install any games that are designed for Android, and run them on the Kindle Fire HDX. <br><br><h2>  <font color="1C1C1C">‚ñå</font> <font color="000000">BATTERY, CHARGING, TIME OF WORK</font> </h2><br>  Battery life is one of the important factors for a tablet.  Users want to use the device all day without recharging.  The manufacturer claims 11 hours of work in the "mixed use" mode (surfing, watching videos or listening to music) and 17 hours in reading mode. <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/838/167/91a/83816791a6da2a6dd47c8def1383a0f0.jpg" alt="image"></a> <br><br>  The capacity of the battery installed on the tablet is 4550 mAh.  The tablet battery was tested by AnTuTu Tester, and I must say that the tablet showed good results.  The AnTuTu Tester test burns the battery up to 19% with a very high load, which is almost never achieved in daily use. <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/33f/e00/4c8/33fe004c839e7a2ef24c8e9e8dd4a44c.png" alt="image"></a> <br><br>  When I tested the tablet, in the video viewing mode at full brightness and volume, it lasted 9 hours. <br><br><h2>  <font color="6BB501">‚ñå</font> <font color="000000">CONCLUSION</font> </h2><br>  Frankly, the Kindle Fire HDX 7 ‚Äùtablet is a great device!  High-quality screen, pleasant sound and high performance combined with excellent battery life just can not please.  Of course, the lack of a native language and familiar applications from Google is distressing, but does this really stop an avid Android user?  No, of course, he will install an alternative firmware and will use the tablet comfortably.  And if you are not, then the standard applications will be enough for you to view and use the content, and no one forbids installing additional programs. <br>  And do not forget about a small price!  On this model during use, I have already seen three promotions at a discount.  Who knows, maybe the company will again please us with a low cost. <br><br><h2>  <font color="0c00ff">‚ñå</font> <font color="000000">ADVANTAGES AND DISADVANTAGES</font> </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/3a7/99a/ea7/3a799aea7d11fc5d49274e15b6642e35.png" alt="image">  High quality materials and build quality, as well as nice design <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/3a7/99a/ea7/3a799aea7d11fc5d49274e15b6642e35.png" alt="image">  Powerful stuffing <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/3a7/99a/ea7/3a799aea7d11fc5d49274e15b6642e35.png" alt="image">  Stunning acoustics with a solid volume margin <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/3a7/99a/ea7/3a799aea7d11fc5d49274e15b6642e35.png" alt="image">  Bright and high-quality display <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/3a7/99a/ea7/3a799aea7d11fc5d49274e15b6642e35.png" alt="image">  Those.  mayday support <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/3a7/99a/ea7/3a799aea7d11fc5d49274e15b6642e35.png" alt="image">  Wi-Fi-module with support for MIMO technology and dual 2.4 and 5 GHz bands <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/3a7/99a/ea7/3a799aea7d11fc5d49274e15b6642e35.png" alt="image">  Excellent battery life <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/3a7/99a/ea7/3a799aea7d11fc5d49274e15b6642e35.png" alt="image">  Amazon Ecosystem <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/4f2/996/400/4f29964003baaf62d7bfefa7f2e32bf1.png" alt="image">  Missing Google services <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/4f2/996/400/4f29964003baaf62d7bfefa7f2e32bf1.png" alt="image">  No HDMI video output <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/4f2/996/400/4f29964003baaf62d7bfefa7f2e32bf1.png" alt="image">  Blue halo around the screen on a white background <br><br><h2>  <font color="E4F43B">‚ñå</font> <font color="000000">PRICE AND PURCHASE</font> </h2><br>  In Russia, the device is not for sale, but <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00BWYQ9YE/ref%3Das_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl%3Fie%3DUTF8%26camp%3D1789%26creative%3D9325%26creativeASIN%3DB00BWYQ9YE%26linkCode%3Das2%26tag%3Dboxover-20">Kindle Fire HDX</a> can be easily bought at the Amazon store using the services of an intermediary <a href="https://qwintry.com/ru/referral/2f71969f">Bandera</a> . <br><br>  <b>It is not difficult to buy a device; it‚Äôs enough to do a few points:</b> <br>  1.
