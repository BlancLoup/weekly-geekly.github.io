  <section class="page js-page"><h1>10 items from the daily life of a modern person who will soon be out of use</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><blockquote>  - Why aren't you writing newspapers? <br>  - What for?  I read computer news on the Internet. <br>  - And in the toilet, what with the keyboard go? <br>  (bearded joke) </blockquote><br><br>  The idea of ‚Äã‚Äãwriting this article came to me when my mobile began to give persistent sound signals indicating the end of the battery charge.  My God, I thought, but in my first mobile there was only a charge indicator on the small screen, and the battery charge was enough for only one day.  Therefore, coming home in the evening, I put my mobile on recharging.  If at that moment, when I bought my first mobile, I would have been told that after 7 years I could use my mobile to take photos, listen to music and go online, I would look at this crazy person and say that you need a phone for that to call it.  Actually, I am sure of it so far, because I use it only for its intended purpose, although, no, sometimes I light my way in a dark entrance.  But the main topic of the article is not idle speculation about how the future will please us, and without which we cannot imagine our life in 10 years.  No, I would like to give a list of reasoned assumptions regarding items that will leave our daily lives in the near future.  Remember, by the way, there was such a thing - a pager, in the 90s it was a very common attribute of a business person, and now this subject can be seen only in the Polytechnic Museum :) <br><br>  So, let's begin: <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><ol><li>  <strong>Television.</strong>  From home TVs will be pumped into transport, entertainment centers and on the streets.  Among my friends there are very few people who watch TV, mostly they are older people.  It is more convenient to watch movies on a DVD or on a computer, the news is better to read on the Internet.  Nowadays, a person strives to control the flow of perceived information, select only the one he needs and filter informational spam.  But how much can the viewer manage the flow of information?  He can only choose a channel, but in reality it is not a choice, but an illusion of choice. </li><li>  <strong>Paper book.</strong>  Previously, a large library could be a family pride, but now books are just a dust collector.  Many began to prefer to read the classics with the help of their handheld computers.  Already produced quite convenient <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25AD%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BA%25D1%2582%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B0%25D1%258F_%25D0%25BA%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B3%25D0%25B0_(%25D1%2583%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B9%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D0%25B2%25D0%25BE)" title="E-book (device)">devices for reading electronic books</a> .  By the way, it would be convenient if such devices would be used as soon as possible at school, this would greatly facilitate school bags and solve the problem of updating textbooks, not to mention that teachers would have more freedom in choosing a more suitable textbook in their subject. .  But the most important advantage of an electronic textbook is the ability to search and quickly jump to the desired section. </li><li>  <strong>Paper notebook and diary.</strong>  I think this item does not need a voluminous comment, many people are already recording addresses and phone numbers on their mobile or keeping a diary on a PDA. </li><li>  <strong>Atlas of highways.</strong>  Such a book, which is available in the glove compartment of any driver, will soon be replaced by <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPS" title="GPS">a GPS device</a> . </li><li>  <strong>Landline phone.</strong>  It is well known that with a large number of subscribers, the cost of mobile communication is less than the cost of servicing a conventional telephone network.  The prices for cellular communication are gradually decreasing, which cannot be said about the charge for a landline phone.  But the main criterion that is decisive in this matter is convenience. </li><li>  <strong>Cash.</strong>  More and more purchases are made with plastic cards.  The system of electronic payments is developing, <a href="http://money.yandex.ru/" title="Yandex money">now even NTV + can be paid using Yandex-Money</a> ... </li><li>  <strong>Photo album.</strong>  Not so long ago, if you were visiting relatives who were not seen for a long time, they gave you a photo album, now they are likely to be offered to see the latest photos on a computer screen. </li><li>  <strong>Calculator.</strong>  Why do I need a calculator separately, if now it is in the computer and mobile phone? </li><li>  <strong>Clock.</strong>  Now there is a timer on almost any electronic device from the computer to the microwave. The clock is in the mobile phone and player, so wearing an additional item, the ability to only display the current time is not quite functional.  A watch combining a mobile, MP3 player or flash memory still has the right to life, while regular watches turn from a vital device into a fashionable attribute, an indicator of social status, or just a bracelet with an additional property to show time. </li><li>  <strong>Newspapers and magazines.</strong>  They are "capturing" the Internet.  Only special periodicals will remain, for example, scientific journals, and for the most part they will be published in electronic versions. </li></ol>

      Of course, this is not a complete list, starting it I did not plan to "embrace the immense."  Any of you can include a few more items at your discretion. <br><br>  You will ask, in fact, why all this work, wait and see what really goes out of use.  But the practical essence of this material is simple - do not buy items from the above list and you will accelerate the onset of the future, and if you still do not follow my advice, then after a few years throw out these anachronisms into the garbage. <br><br>  <a href="http://blog.abzats.com/node/33">Read the original article at http://blog.abzats.com</a> <br></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/16283/">https://habr.com/ru/post/16283/</a></p>
