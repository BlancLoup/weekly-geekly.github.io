  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How to achieve a balance between work and life</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The balance between work and life is too important to entrust the care of your employer, Nigel Marsh argues.  Speaking at the TEDxSydney conference, Nigel Marsh gives his idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe perfect day, which harmoniously combines time for family, personal needs and work - and offers an exciting idea of ‚Äã‚Äãhow this can be achieved.  The main idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe report is that the winner is not the one who has more money in the wallet at the time of death, but the one who came to the meaningful idea of ‚Äã‚Äãhow a well-balanced life should look.  Personally, in this report I saw a lot of useful information for myself, I recommend viewing,% username%. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/qk2ER6pryp0%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700023,15700186,15700191,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhhvq5PjGPeblVGT1B2TdmE3t4VteQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  For those who like to read, and not to look under the cut abbreviated text version. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Having lived to 40 years in the fruitless search for harmony and balance between work and personal life, Nigel decided to conduct an experiment.  He quit his job and devoted himself entirely to his family: his wife, children, home.  Two years after the start of the experiment, he realized that it was easy to achieve a balance between life and work when you had no work.

      The experience was not particularly useful in the absence of money for life. <br><br>  Nigel is back at work. <br><br>  The next seven years went in search of a balance between work and life and an attempt to theorize him by writing a book about it. <br>  The result was four main conclusions. <br><br><h5>  The first </h5>  You need to honestly look at the root of the problem, and not talk nonsense about the convenient work schedule, the ability to take a vacation and wear comfortable clothes on Fridays.  The problem is that it is absolutely impossible to combine career growth with the life of a young family.  The reality is that thousands of people spend most of their life in hateful work only to buy a few unnecessary things and impress people who are unsympathetic to them. <br><br><h5>  Second </h5>  The solution to the problem lies only with us.  No government or employer, be it even the coolest corporations, will ever care to balance the workload and the personal life of their worker.  Each of us is personally responsible for their lifestyle.  If you do not plan your life yourself, it will be done for you, and the balance will be broken exactly in your favor.  Each leader needs only one thing - to squeeze out all that is possible from you, spending as little money, time and effort as possible.  Therefore, it is important to never trust the responsibility for planning your life to any commercial organization. <br><br><h5>  Third </h5>  It is necessary to be very careful and responsible, soberly looking at the realities of life, to work out a time scale for your balanced day.  First, Ningel came up with something like this: he got up well in the morning, had sex, walked with the dog, had breakfast with his wife and children, had sex, brought the children to school on the way to the office, worked for 3 hours, played during a break in a sports game with a friend , I worked for another 3 hours, went out to the pub, where I missed a glass with friends, went home and had dinner with my wife and children, meditated for half an hour, had sex, walked with the dog, again some sex, went to bed.  In real life it is impossible to do all this in one day.  But it is also impossible to postpone everything until later when you retire, when the children leave your home or you divorce your wife.  It is necessary to find a middle ground. <br><br><h5>  Fourth </h5>  We need a balanced approach to the allocation of the cost of their time for a particular occupation.  If you have enough health to work 10 hours a day, spending another 2 hours on the way from home to work and back, and you complain that you do not have enough time for any personal life, you will not be helped to register for classes in gym.  This, of course, is very good, but only for your physical health.  But there is still a spiritual life.  It is necessary to find and allocate time for the development of the intellectual, emotional and spiritual aspects of our life.  One day, Ningel had to quit his job an hour earlier to replace a spouse when he had to go out with their child in the evening.  They went to the park, ride the rides, had fun and laughed all evening.  And when they came home and the father began to put his son to bed, he told him that it was the best day of his life.  There was no visit to Disneyland, nor the purchase of an expensive gaming console ... Just some little things.  So, little things - are extremely important.  To achieve balance in life it is not necessary to change something radically in it.  You can make high-quality small ‚Äúinvestments‚Äù where you really need it.  And, if you follow this rule, everyone, and not just one person, can qualitatively transform the life of not just an individual, but also of the whole society.  If the number of people who do this in their lives gains a certain critical mass, their way of life will change the perception of success in society.  It will become clear to everyone that the <b>winner is not the one who has more money in the wallet at the time of death, but the one who came to the sensible idea of ‚Äã‚Äãhow a well-balanced life should look</b> . <br><br>  Now you know that a balance is necessary both in work and in personal life, on the basis of this it is worthwhile to set more meaningful goals for the future that should not contradict each other.  In psychology, this is called an environmental goal. <br>  Environmental friendliness is of two types: external and internal. <br>  External environmental friendliness is compliance or non-compliance of your goal with other goals. <br>  Internal environmental friendliness is compliance or non-compliance of the goal with your beliefs, feelings, way of life. <br><br>  If you need a tool with which you can carry out organized work on your goals - join <strong><a href="https://smartprogress.do/">SmartProgress, a service for setting and achieving goals</a></strong> . <br><br></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/196220/">https://habr.com/ru/post/196220/</a></p>
