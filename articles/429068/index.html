      So, we completed the repair and reorganization in our Moscow store on ul.  Ordzhonikidze, 11, p. 1A.  Now we are preparing for the opening.  Under the cut a few words about how we did it, what we did and what awaits our visitors on November 10 and 11 from 14:00 to 18:00. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h3>  How it was? </h3><br>  We constantly lacked space in Moscow, which was extremely inconvenient for buyers, periodically there was a turn in the showroom, and those who wanted to listen to another purchase had to wait a long time.  Also the problem was the storage of the necessary range.  Part of this had to be kept in warehouses, which obviously made it difficult to search and demonstrate specific models. <br><br>  Unfortunately, due to the expansion of the regional network and the high demand for the salon on Ordzhonikidze, we constantly postponed the update, but finally decided.  So, we decided to make the store bigger and more convenient.  Selling space increased by 2 times.  The new store occupies 2 floors and is equipped with 3 listening rooms. <br><br>  Starting work, we removed everything that was before.  It was decided to completely change the design, focusing not on the delights of the interior, but on the goods.  After the total removal of all that was before, the showroom looked like this: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/rf/jw/xr/rfjwxro-hhf-xn5rmqsxygd5dhm.jpeg"><br><br>  Naturally, the acoustic design of the listening rooms also had to be recreated.  in advance of calculating the parameters of the new premises.  Then repair work began, which included both acoustic and aesthetic design. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/rc/bp/tm/rcbptmods71dcd3henm2xmfm3w4.jpeg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/_k/kn/zf/_kknzf6lmcqzptu3ykxjdxwnihm.jpeg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ym/rd/he/ymrdhel0l0obyhwvyljancypxy8.jpeg"><br><br><h3>  What will happen at the opening? </h3><br>  As I have already noted, a new store will open on November 10 and 11.  For those who want to buy equipment on this day, a discount of up to 25% for the entire range will be valid.  Also as part of the opening of the tenth and eleventh of November, master classes from several well-known brands will be held: <br><br><ul><li>  Emotiva &amp; Music Hall (15: 00-16: 00); </li><li>  Cambridge Audio (15: 00-16: 00) </li><li>  Marantz &amp; Dynaudio (16: 30-17: 30); </li><li>  Beyerdynamic (16: 30-17: 30). </li></ul><br>  At the master classes you can talk with representatives of brands and ask questions about their products.  For the participants of the opening there will be a buffet table, and besides, we have prepared small gifts for everyone who will visit the event - headphones. <br><br><h3>  Total </h3><br>  We invite our readers to attend the event and see for ourselves what we have done with the new store.  We sincerely hope that you will enjoy the events and you will appreciate what you have done. <br><br>  Those wishing to attend the event should be pre- <a href="https://www.pult.ru/news/%3Fid%3Dotkrytie-magazina-pult-ru-v-moskve">registered</a> . <br><br>  <i>Once again, I gently remind you that these days it will be possible to get a discount of up to 25% on the entire range, which can be found in the <a href="https://www.pult.ru/">catalog</a> .</i> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/429068/">https://habr.com/ru/post/429068/</a></p>
