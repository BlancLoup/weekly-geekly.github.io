And do not want to do a tyap-lyap. <br>  This article is about adding drivers to XCP, using the example of installing a network card. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  To solve the set tasks of 2x network cards, I didn‚Äôt have enough, in our region it is quite difficult to get something needed, so I have to be content with what we have.  Strolling through the shops were purchased network card D-Link DGE-560T (PCI Express v. 1.1, gigabit, low-profile, with interchangeable mounting plates). <br>  Having inserted the network card into the case, with fingers crossed, I started the car, in the BIOS the card is visible - it is already good.  We are waiting for the XCP start and see the first disappointment, in the NIC tab we see only 2 of our embedded cards

Check whether our axis sees the piece of hardware itself (XCP is based on Centos 5.7 (Linux kernel v2.6.32.43)) the command will help us with this: <br>  <b>lspci</b> <br><pre><code class="bash hljs">&gt; 07:00.0 Ethernet controller: D-Link System Inc DGE-528T Gigabit Ethernet Adapter (rev 06)</code> </pre> <br>  Already well, the axis sees our piece of iron (although not quite correctly). <br><br>  Here, a small digression, the comments indicated that installing a hypervisor is not such a thorny path, even if it is so for some - but when you follow someone's instructions, you don‚Äôt think what was behind this instruction, and the author rarely talks about those actions that led to errors or gave an incorrect result.  For example, when installing a network card, I, like any reasonable person, went to the manufacturer‚Äôs website, found the device, downloaded the latest drivers, and suffered for 2 days trying to make friends with the system, I could write it off on my little experience with unix-like systems, but Attraction of familiar experts from the side did not help, Google said that for these drivers this is a common problem and no one described a solution for it.  On one foreign resource, it was suggested to try older drivers and they really came up and earned a miracle.  As you can see, even such a short description takes up a whole paragraph (imkho not very necessary) text, therefore, take for granted that there were problems and I post the optimal, in my not sophisticated way, solution. <br><br>  So, it will be necessary to install drivers, but everything is not as simple as it seems, therefore I offer you a sequence of actions.  To install firewood, you will need to install libraries to build <code>gcc gcc44 glibc-devel dkms</code> .  But first you need to edit several repository configuration files so that our Yum can download and install what you need. <br>  Open the files and change all the keys in enable = 0 to 1: <br>  <b>nano /etc/yum.repos.d/CentOS-Base.repo</b> <b><br></b>  <b>nano /etc/yum.repos.d/CentOS-Vault.repo</b> <br><br>  For convenience, I recommend to put several useful utilities <code>MC, HTOP, MTR</code> . <br>  <b>yum install mc</b> <br><br>  You will also need the make utility to build. <br>  <b>yum install make</b> <br><br>  Next you have to connect an additional repository, because  Something in the base repository can not be found (including htop and dkms) I use the RPM Forge repository. <br>  Here is the list of repositories for Centos. <br>  And <a href="http://centos.name/%3Fpage/additionalresources/RPMForge">here is the</a> instruction for connecting the repository we need specifically. <br>  To begin with we will be defined with the version of Centos and type of system: <br>  <b>uname -a</b> <br><pre> <code class="bash hljs">Linux XenSecond 2.6.32.43-0.4.1.xs1.6.10.734.170748xen <span class="hljs-comment"><span class="hljs-comment">#1 SMP Thu Nov 22 18:23:25 EST 2012 i686 i686 i386 GNU/Linux</span></span></code> </pre><br>  <b>rpm -q centos-release</b> <br><pre> <code class="bash hljs">centos-release-5-7.el5.centos</code> </pre><br>  Well, we decided what we are dealing with and now we know exactly which version of the repository we need to connect, which we actually do.  Download the link above the rpm package and install it with the command (do not forget to go to the folder with the downloaded package - I poured it over SSH into the / home daddy). <br>  <b>yum --nogpgcheck localinstall rpmforge-release-0.5.3-1.el5.rf.i386.rpm</b> <br>  Install the repository key. <br>  <b>rpm --import</b> <b><code><a href="http://apt.sw.be/RPM-GPG-KEY.dag.txt"></a> apt.sw.be/RPM-GPG-KEY.dag.txt</code></b> <br> <br>  Now we are installing everything that we need when installing the drivers: <br>  <b>yum install gcc gcc44 glibc-devel dkms htop</b> <br><br>  It remains just a little to install kernel packages for XCP - it was necessary to tinker with to look for its <code>2.6.32.43-0.4.1.xs1.6.10.734.170748xe</code> version - because if you just enter <br>  <b>yum install kernel-xen-devel</b> - so do not do this !!! <br>  Then we will be offered to install the package <code>2.6.18-371.1.2.el5.centos.plus</code> , which for some reason really does not like the installer driver. <br>  Google and download <code>kernel-xen-devel-2.6.32.43-0.4.1.xs1.6.10.734.170748.i686.rpm</code> and <code>kernel-xen-devel-2.6.32.43-0.4.1.xs1.6.10.734.170748.i686.rpm</code> it <br>  <b>rpm -i kernel-xen-devel-2.6.32.43-0.4.1.xs1.6.10.734.170748.i686.rpm</b> <br>  Then we download firewood for our Dlink card DGE-560T.  I will tell you a secret, the firewood downloaded from the site turned out to be very capricious, because I copied the drivers from the included disk, then, going to the drivers folder, I started the installation with the command <br>  <b>sh autorun.sh</b> <br>  If we now log into XenCenter and click the Rescan button in the NICs tab, we will see a new network adapter.  If you think that this finish is not in a hurry, as it turned out, XCP after a reboot can easily change the interface names in some places, and then sit and guess why the VLAN does not rise. To solve this problem, go <a href="http://support.citrix.com/article/CTX135809">here</a> and read to full enlightenment or just do it : <br>  1. we do <b>ifconfig</b> and we remember <code>HWaddr</code> all our interfaces. <br>  2. do <b>nano /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/interface-rename-data/static-rules.conf</b> and add entries of this kind to this file <br> <code>eth0: mac ="E4:11:5B:A9:BE:F0" <br> eth2: mac ="AC:F1:DF:3F:EF:FB" <br> eth1: mac ="E4:11:5B:A9:BE:F1"</code> <br>  as values ‚Äã‚Äãfor <code>mac</code> insert previously remembered <code>HWaddr</code> . <br>  3. run such a terrible team <br>  <b>etc / sysconfig / network-scripts / interface-rename.py -r</b> <br>  4. To calm our conscience, we can see in the log whether we are doing well: <br>  <b>cat /var/log/interface-rename.log.</b> <br>  5. Now we will make Ksenserver reskan network interfaces: <br>  <b>xe pif-scan host-uuid =</b> <br>  6. And now be sure to overload the machine. <br>  7. If as a result of your actions there are dead interfaces, which can not be removed, you need to do this: <br>  but.  <b>xe network-list</b> (look for the extra network and remember its UUID) <br>  b.  <b>xe network-destroy uuid = 60afcf0e-668f-02ad-5110-84408c41fd9</b> (we get the error <code>The network contains active PIFs and cannot be deleted. pifs: 60679ca5-9f06-9847-b5d2-d1bcffb6e2fe</code> and tell us the UIF to delete) <br>  at.  do <b>xe pif-forget uuid = 60679ca5-9f06-9847-b5d2-d1bcffb6e2fe</b> <br>  and again do <b>xe network-destroy uuid = 60afcf0e-668f-02ad-5110-84408c41fd9</b> <br>  As a result, peace of mind and tranquility will return to your XCP. <br><br>  For more convenient work install utilities <br>  <b>yum install htop mtr</b> <br>  Don't forget, after all this, edit all repository configuration files again and return 0 instead of 1. <br>  <b>nano /etc/yum.repos.d/CentOS-Base.repo</b> <b><br></b>  <b>nano /etc/yum.repos.d/CentOS-Vault.repo</b> <br>  For a good sound sleep, you should also disable the RPM repository - but I did not do this, as the experiments continue. <br><br>  In the next article I will try to lay out a comparative analysis and explain why I chose XCP to deploy virtualization technologies. <br>  Thank you all, I am waiting for your questions. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/204052/">https://habr.com/ru/post/204052/</a></p>
