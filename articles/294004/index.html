Part 2</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  <i>Be sure to read to anyone who provides free access to the Internet to their customers.</i> <br><br> <a href="http://megamozg.ru/company/smart-soft/blog/18892/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/98c/6ac/45e/98c6ac45e7824fd784f04caa36f3add5.png" align="left" width="230"></a>  From January 2016, owners of open Wi-Fi networks will be fined for the lack of mandatory user identification.  The ban on anonymous Wi-Fi is set out in the <a href="http://www.rg.ru/2014/08/05/svyaz-site-dok.html">RF Government Decree No. 758</a> on access to the public Internet.  The document came into force in August last year, but network owners are not in a hurry to follow its requirements.  Fines are meant to rectify the situation. <br><br>  Very soon, problems with law enforcement and regulatory authorities may arise from those who provide their customers with free access to the network.  This will affect cafes, bars, restaurants, hotels, cinemas, sports clubs, auto and railway stations, airports, shopping centers and other public institutions that do not fulfill the requirement for mandatory user authorization. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Identifying users is suggested using:

      1) an identity document (in the case of collective access points); <br>  2) an account on the website of public services; <br>  3) mobile phone numbers. <br><br>  The owners of the network, who do not implement any of these methods until the beginning of 2016, will face an unpleasant surprise: for providing anonymous access to Wi-Fi, individual entrepreneurs face a fine of 5 to 50 thousand rubles, legal entities from 100 to 200 thousand rubles .  Repeated violation will cost individual entrepreneurs as early as 10‚Äì100 thousand rubles or will result in disqualification for up to three years, and legal entities will pay up to 300 thousand rubles. <br><br>  Kolomna chain of caf√©-shops "MIX-point".  City Food, following the example of the Moscow Metro and the McDonald's restaurant chain, which were the first to launch the mandatory user authorization procedure, decided to fulfill the requirement of the law, not waiting for sanctions. <br><br>  <b>Alexander Yamashkin,</b> <i>head of software development department at <a href="http://smart-soft.ru/ru/">Smart-Soft</a> :</i> <br><br>  - To provide the owners of public Wi-Fi points with the service of identifying users, we have expanded the functionality of the Traffic Inspector software product and made a <a href="http://www.smart-soft.ru/ru/products/restaurant-edition/">special version for establishments that provide free Internet access to their customers.</a>  The network owner has the right to choose with which of the SMS providers to conclude a cooperation agreement.  If the provider with whom the customer of the service wants to work does not appear in the Traffic Inspector list, the developers will add it. <br><br>  There are two options for SMS payment: network owner and end user.  The first method has been implemented in the cafe: approximate expenses will amount to 5 thousand rubles a month with an average traffic of 500 people daily.  Not so much money, and the owner of the institution, who wants to increase its attractiveness through free Wi-Fi, can well afford such expenses.  For visitors to the cafe authorization will be free.  For the time being, it will take place only by the mobile phone number, and in the future, identification through the site of public services will be added. <br><br>  How it will work: a cafe visitor will be asked to enter a phone number when trying to connect to a Wi-Fi network.  An SMS will be sent to the indicated number with a confirmation code.  After entering it, the user will get access to the Internet. <br><br>  The new functionality will allow the network owner: <br><br>  - comply with the requirements of the law on access to the public Internet and, accordingly, avoid fines; <br>  - protect the visitors' data, which they will enter to connect to the free Wi-Fi network, from leakage; <br>  - identify users without any efforts on the part of the administrator: once you install the equipment and configure the retention period for user data, you no longer have to integrate into the system - identification will be done automatically. <br><br>  Among other things, network owners will be able to recoup the investment on the software by monetizing the page where users will enter their data.  Read more about how to do this in the next post. <br><br>  How to start identifying users right now, we told about the example of one cafe network.  In Russia, there are more than 100 thousand public Wi-Fi points - they are located in institutions of various directions.  After the size of the fines for the absence of obligatory registration of users became known, the almost Hamlet ‚ÄúIdentify or not identify?‚Äù Is no longer a question for most of their owners. <br><br>  * Beginning of the publication ‚ÄúFor Wi-Fi Answer‚Äù can be read <a href="http://spark.ru/startup/smart-soft/blog/10880/za-wi-fi-otvetish">here</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/294004/">https://habr.com/ru/post/294004/</a></p>
