  <section class="page js-page"><h1>SQA Days-14 in Lviv. Debunking the myths about Western Ukraine</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  There is a generally accepted view that Western Ukraine is a harsh place where Russian-speaking fiercely hate and it is dangerous to go there. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/fa8/a48/c60/fa8a48c6086bda3e15ad0a6266ef6558.jpg" alt="image"></div><br>  In order to check the rumors about Western citizens of Ukraine who are militant towards Russians, as well as assess the possibility of holding a software testing conference - <a href="http://www.sqadays.com/">SQA Days-14</a> , we went to the very heart of Western Ukraine - the city of Lviv.  What we have seen does not fit in with the common stereotypes. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  So, what we saw in Lviv: <br>  1) People who speak their native language. <br>  Ukrainian speech is very beautiful and, in fact, you get aesthetic pleasure by listening to Ukrainians.  They easily understand Russian, but they will most likely answer in the Ukrainian language :) However, it can be easily understood.  It is wonderful that people have kept their language and their culture, it would be strange for them to blame them for that.  No one blames the British or French for not knowing Russian.  By the way, there you can communicate in English, many are fluent in it, and all the inscriptions are duplicated on it. <br>  2) People who will always help. <br>  If you ask for directions or a specific address on the street, several people will stop and explain where to go.  Notice asked in Russian.  No aggression - exceptional goodwill. 
      <br>

      <br>
      And also: <br>  1) Tourist center and a beautiful old town <br>  Lviv is a beautiful architectural and developed tourist center.  There are many sights, museums, castles and simply beautiful old European-style buildings.  In the city you can find a lot of shops with tourist products.  There are magnets with inscriptions like: "Thank God that I am not Moskal."  And in restaurants you can find a piece of seemingly politically incorrect anecdotes, again, about Muscovites.  But all this is nothing more than a joke, a commercial move, designed to diversify the rest of tourists.  We asked the locals: Is there any negative manifestation towards the Russians?  They took this question with humor. <br>  2) Wonderful and very unusual cafes. <br>  Did you know that in Lviv coffee is extracted from the mine?  :) You will learn how to do this by visiting Kopal'nu Kava.  This is a huge number of varieties of coffee with different liqueurs.  And then there is the "Masonic Lodge", "Kryivka".  We will not talk about them, let it remain a surprise. <br>  3) Excellent service in hotels, restaurants and shops. <br><br>  In Lviv, we talked to the wonderful Lviv testers community, one of the most active communities in the CIS.  Guys often meet, share experiences, hone their elocution skills, to later become speakers at international testing conferences or engage in customer consulting or training.  Community activists have opened a testing school.  Very interesting and right in our opinion initiative. <br><br>  They impressed us with their cordiality.  They helped us in every possible way, acquainted them with colleagues from other companies (by the way, they are all friends and it‚Äôs great). <br><br>  Visiting Lviv, we realized that this is a great place to hold the next SQA Days-14 conference, and it will take place <b>on November 8-9, 2013</b> .  Also here we decided to try a new conference format - <b>on November 7</b> we will have a special English day, during which communication will be conducted only in English.  There will be speakers from Western Europe. <br><br><iframe src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://player.vimeo.com/video/70715403&amp;xid=17259,15700022,15700186,15700190,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhiukP1LCo-kZ7UQnkBtqjgrpC5Ulw" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" title="SQA Days-14.
