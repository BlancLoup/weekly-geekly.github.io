After it was replaced tapes and CDs.  In the 90s and 2000s, records became the subject of collecting among fans of rare records.  In the 10 years that have passed since the first Day of the music store, much has changed. <br><br>  The holiday, in which rock stars are involved, contributed to the fact that the records became fashionable again - not only among eccentric collectors.  In recent years, more and more music lovers are rediscovering vinyl.

      In response to this trend, we launched the <a href="https://www.audiomania.ru/vinyl-academy-pro-ject/%3Futm_source%3Dgtvinyl042018">Vinyl Academy project</a> .  Within its framework, we talk about the "vinyl" world, about affordable and high-quality equipment for playing records and how the culture of listening to analog media has changed in recent years. <br><br>  In the wake of the "old new" fashion for vinyl, players and platinum began to appear more often in movies and TV shows, famous musicians, athletes and actors became actively interested in vinyl.  Some of them are accustomed to listening to records from youth, others - are attached only now.  Today, remember their names and tell about what is behind their passion for vinyl. <br><br> <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/audiomania/blog/299871/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/w_/ip/sg/w_ipsgswq17qqoq49wolwt42u2o.png"></a> <a name="habracut"></a><br>  <font color="#A9A9A9"><i>Photo <a href="https://pxhere.com/en/photo/130011">Pxhere</a> / PD</i></font> <br><br><h2>  Music lovers old school </h2><br>  You can easily find old photos of many famous people in his youth next to the players of that time.  <a href="https://imgur.com/gallery/nBjWXjr">Jack Nicholson</a> , <a href="https://twitter.com/thisisjohnbook/status/738992238227644417">Muhammad Ali</a> , <a href="https://nzzas.nzz.ch/sport/jetzt-gibts-fuer-die-sportler-was-auf-die-ohren-ld.1342583%3Freduced%3Dtrue">Diego Maradona</a> - they all listened to music on records almost half a century ago.  There are those who carried this habit through life. <br><br>  There is a <a href="https://www.wired.com/2014/04/steve-jobs-stereo-system/">photograph of</a> Steve Jobs, taken in his house in 1982.  On it, he sits in a room in which there is nothing but a lamp and a record player.  It is known that Jobs, whom Neil Young called the pioneer of digital music, <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2094590/Steve-Jobs-listened-vinyl-home-iPod.html">remained loyal to vinyl</a> in the 2000s.  Moreover, he preferred the plate iPod.  Steve Jobs loved the music of the 60s - he collected Bob Dylan, Beatles and The Rolling Stones albums. <br><br>  Daft Punk members - Tom Bangalter and Guy-Manuel de Omem-Cristo - are younger than Steve Jobs, but they also caught the time when vinyl was the main audio medium.  Tribute to this culture can be traced, for example, in the video Random Access Memories Unboxed 2013 - Daft Punk <a href="https://youtu.be/Rr12u1tk_rM">used the</a> <a href="https://www.audiomania.ru/proigryvatel_vinila/pro-ject/%3Futm_source%3Dgtvinyl042018">Pro-Ject</a> player <a href="https://youtu.be/Rr12u1tk_rM">in the frame</a> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/hp/15/29/hp1529069crwmzbqkp1y7dvkhw0.jpeg"><br>  <font color="#A9A9A9"><i>Photo <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/swimfinfan/16120821551">swimfinfan</a> / <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.0/">CC</a></i></font> <br><br>  Questlove - the drummer and one of the founders of the famous hip-hop band The Roots in the 90s - only recently <a href="http://www.okayplayer.com/news/questlove-shows-massive-vinyl-collection-latest-installment-dust-grooves.html">showed</a> its extensive collection of records.  The history of some records in his archive is associated with memories from childhood, when his parents <a href="https://dustandgrooves.com/ahmir-questlove-thompson-philadelphia-pa-an-excerpt/">left him to live</a> with his grandmother - according to the musician, during this period, adults had to ‚Äúpay off‚Äù plates with him in exchange for good behavior. <br><br>  The hermit writer Haruki Murakami <a href="https://thevinylfactory.com/news/take-an-interactive-tour-of-haruki-murakamis-record-room/">equipped a</a> separate room for his collection.  He used to work under jazz on vinyl, which is why the records are still so important to him. <br><br>  Another long-time vinyl fan is <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/shopping-and-consumer-news/12044846/Return-of-the-record-Tesco-first-supermarket-to-sell-vinyls.html">Prince Charles</a> .  According to Max Hole, the former head of the record company Universal Music Group International, the prince personally told him about his love of vinyl. <br><br><h2>  The younger generation of vinyl lovers </h2><br>  The youth of some celebrities came in the years of the triumph of the CD and the birth of streaming.  However, among them there are those who prefer vinyl. <br><br>  Not everyone knows that Elijah Wood is not only an actor, but also a DJ.  He began playing with music supervisor Zack Cowie a few years ago.  In the collection of the actor, not only records for DJ sets, but also soundtracks and classical albums. <br><br>  Last year, Wood <a href="http://exclaim.ca/film/article/elijah_woods_dream_is_to_open_a_record_store">told</a> in an interview about the desire to open his record store with music.  When asked why Elijah chose vinyl, he <a href="https://autre.love/interviewsmain/2015/12/15/a-bromance-in-vinyl-an-interview-with-elijah-wood-and-zach-cowie-of-the-dj-duo-wooden-wisdom">replied</a> that the matter is in the media itself - it is real, you can touch it. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/1c/jk/ik/1cjkikkef9kvzicr6rbzumvzuq4.png"><br>  <font color="#A9A9A9"><i><a href="">Autopilot</a> / <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Commons:Reusing_content_outside_Wikimedia">CC</a> Photo</i></font> <br><br>  Martin Freeman - another actor who played the hobbit, and a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2010/mar/28/martin-freeman-celebrity-squares">famous fan of vinyl</a> .  In one interview, for example, he stated that his favorite gadget is a regular player, to which he was used from childhood.  When Martin was asked what he would add to the player, he joked about the function of making tea.  The actor likes that the player performs only one task, but does it very well. <br><br>  In another interview, Martin <a href="https://www.tinymixtapes.com/features/martin-freeman-office-uk">said</a> that he doesn‚Äôt feel ‚Äúpossessing music until it is on a piece of plastic.‚Äù  In this case, the CD has never brought him as much pleasure as vinyl. <br><br>  Music producer and rapper <a href="https://medium.com/micro-chop/madlib-owns-four-tons-of-vinyl-bafb3c2296e3">Madlib</a> also <a href="https://medium.com/micro-chop/madlib-owns-four-tons-of-vinyl-bafb3c2296e3">can‚Äôt imagine</a> his life without records.  He has 4 tons of them or, as <a href="https://twitter.com/oliverswang/status/802182763012968449">calculated</a> on Twitter, 16 thousand pieces. <br><br>  American football player Delaney Walker, despite membership in the National League, is still <a href="https://www.tennessean.com/story/sports/nfl/titans/2015/12/29/delanie-walker-titans-star-collects-records-nfl-pro-bowl-hello-adele-hozier-leon-bridges-justin-bieber-music-collection-vinyl/77527516/">visiting a</a> regular store in Nashville to select a new record.  He has a love for vinyl since childhood.  He appreciates the records for the memories and feelings that they give: "You can not miss the track, you should listen to the whole album, appreciate this album." <br><br><h2>  Music lovers from the screens </h2><br>  Not only well-known actors, but also their film incarnations love vinyl.  The plates often reveal the nature of the characters.  For example, Harvey Specter in Force Majors (Suits) is a successful lawyer who is all-the-best.  Including an impressive <a href="https://thespinoff.co.nz/tv/14-04-2016/whats-actually-in-harveys-record-collection-gabriel-macht-reveals-a-shocking-suits-secret/">collection of vinyl records</a> . <br><br>  The records for him are partly a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DEFYDOkO6zrQ">tribute to</a> the saxophonist father, and partly a collectible.  The collection, by the way, completely reflects the character of the character - this is mainly jazz and blues, which "the best lawyer in New York" is quite appropriate to listen to, breaking away from serious intellectual work (which Harvey actually does).  As the actor Gabriel Macht <a href="http://ew.com/article/2011/08/18/suits-harvey-spector/">says</a> , who played the role of a lawyer: "Harvey ... listens to music when he needs to calm down and think." <br><br>  It is quite another thing - the hero <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/arts-and-entertainment/wp/2015/08/23/american-ultra-reveals-the-start-of-a-new-movie-trend-stoners-as-heroes">Jesse Eisenberg</a> in "Ultra-Americans."  He is the exact opposite of a successful lawyer from Force Majeure.  However, in this case, vinyl perfectly complements the character of the hero - but this time allows you to create an underground and a bit nostalgic image. <br><br>  Vinyl lovers often speak of him as an emotional medium with its own unique character.  In some films, the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthis ‚Äúwarmth and luminosity‚Äù is raised to the absolute - vinyl becomes a symbol of everything sincere and present.  For example, in the world of "Equilibrium", where emotions and everything that can cause them, are forbidden, the hero <a href="https://youtu.be/lmG57WlIpEc">discovers a</a> gramophone.  The record with the 9th symphony of Beethoven acts as a catalyst that arouses interest and turns the hero's whole life. <br><br>  Vinyl can sometimes be seen in Russian cinema - the <a href="https://www.audiomania.ru/proigryvatel_vinila/pro-ject/%3Futm_source%3Dgtvinyl042018">Pro-Ject player</a> and records, for example, complement the interiors in the Pavel Lungin film ‚ÄúDama Pik‚Äù.  It is no coincidence, by the way, that this carrier in the picture is visually ‚Äúconnected‚Äù with the opera - the creators of ‚ÄúLadies Peak‚Äù, as well as in Suits, refer to the idea of ‚Äã‚Äã‚Äúintellectuality‚Äù of vinyl. <br><br>  Vinyl appears in the cinema and conquers its place in the life of real music lovers by chance - it is really a special format with a rich history, an interesting past and, of course, a promising future.  About everything connected with it, we will continue to talk as part of our special project. <br><br>  <i>The main task of the ‚Äú <a href="https://www.audiomania.ru/vinyl-academy-pro-ject/%3Futm_source%3Dgtvinyl042018">Vinyl Academy</a> ‚Äù is to dispel the myths and the atmosphere of mystery around the world of vinyl, in a simple and understandable language to tell about the listening culture, the subtleties of setting players and the care of the records.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>We regularly release new materials and answer popular questions - follow us on social networks ( <a href="https://vk.com/vinylacademy">VKontakte</a> and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/vinylacademyamproject/">Facebook</a> ) and on <a href="https://www.audiomania.ru/vinyl-academy-pro-ject/%3Futm_source%3Dgtvinyl042018">the project page</a> .</i> <br><br><hr><br>  <i>Additional reading on the topic from our "World Hi-Fi":</i> <i><br><br></i> <ul><li>  <a href="https://www.audiomania.ru/content/art-4578.html%3Futm_source%3Dgtvinyl042018">Vinyl: New is well forgotten old</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://www.audiomania.ru/content/art-4729.html%3Futm_source%3Dgtvinyl042018">Vinyl died long live vinyl</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://www.audiomania.ru/content/art-4830.html%3Futm_source%3Dgtvinyl042018">New-old formats: HD-vinyl and DIY-plates</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://www.audiomania.ru/content/art-4082.html%3Futm_source%3Dgtvinyl042018">How the largest vinyl record factory works</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://www.audiomania.ru/content/art-5584.html%3Futm_source%3Dgtvinyl042018">Is cassette a new vinyl?</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://www.audiomania.ru/content/art-4100.html%3Futm_source%3Dgtvinyl042018">The history of vinyl.</a>  <a href="https://www.audiomania.ru/content/art-4100.html%3Futm_source%3Dgtvinyl042018">Unfading sound</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://www.audiomania.ru/content/art-4746.html%3Futm_source%3Dgtvinyl042018">Find and save: how to save music, buying up all the vinyl records of the world</a> </li></ul></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/371421/">https://habr.com/ru/post/371421/</a></p>
