  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Joint payment or "throw off and save up" - a bit more specifically</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  An interesting idea is expressed in this article.  Regarding this topic, a couple of thoughts have appeared, with which I want to develop a topic, share thoughts and consult.  I got to the subject so much that I decided on the first habropost - apologize in advance for some confusion in the presentation. <br><br>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blog/startup_ideas/44201.html">In the comments to this topic</a> was a couple of links ( <a href="http://www.fundable.com/">fundable.com</a> , <a href="http://www.chipin.com/">chipin.com</a> ) to similar services.  These services offer the conclusion of transactions with joint payment under various subjects of transactions.  Topics such as: raising money for social projects, short films, buying gifts, group acquisitions, etc. <br><br>  I believe that such a service (a page offering the collection of money for joint acquisitions) may well have chances for existence and development if it is focused on a specific product segment.  I see this service in this light: <a name="habracut"></a>

      Customer point of view: Consumer - user (administrator, integrator) CMS.  He comes to mind (or receives an order) for some kind of expansion.  The consumer publishes the idea / TK of the extension in order to find people who would also have the desire to introduce such an extension and are ready to be thrown off for implementation. <br><br>  The point of view of the performer: the performer is a coder.  He comes up with the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãsome kind of expansion.  He publishes a description of the extension and the amount for which he is ready to implement the idea in order to find people who would like to introduce such an extension and are ready to go back to work on programming. <br><br>  It seems to me that CMS extensions are ideally suited as a service topic for the following reasons: <br><br>  - CMS all sorts of different; <br>  - extensions are used by many people; <br>  - The price for writing an extension often exceeds the financial capacity of an individual to such an extent that the price makes an individual order uninteresting; <br>  - until the person reads the description of the future functionality of the extension, he may not know that he wants to implement it - here the very wording of the idea motivates to fold for implementation and implement the product; <br><br>  I can also imagine that there are a lot of ideas born by coders and users who have withered at the root (ideas have shrunk, not coders): a good idea has come, but there is no possibility of realization on pure enthusiasm.  But if someone supported a little, then you see, and there would be time, and feed for the enthusiasm. <br><br>  What problems can you encounter when implementing such a service? <br><br>  Of course, the problem of trust.  This problem, in my opinion, is small - people make donation on the Internet rather impulsively, and an idea that requires donation almost always has some credibility.  There are many practical examples of trust - for example, purchases on ebay. <br><br>  Another problem: what to do if the required amount is not collected?  The problem is complex and it is connected with the features of Internet payment systems.  A donation (deposit) should occur as a pledge (I don‚Äôt know exactly how it is in Russian ‚Äî my Russian is not native) ‚Äîthis is the introduction of a sum that can be taken back under certain conditions (the dictionary says that this is a pledge).  Paypal has a maximum term of 26 days (not much IMHO).  So, if the declared amount is not recruited - those who threw off, get the money back.  Topikstarter should be able to change (reduce / increase) the amount of the required amount. <br><br>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blog/startup_ideas/44201.html">As noted in the comments to the first article on the topic</a> , the results must be open source. <br><br>  I believe that the implementation of such a service is a useful and progressive business, since on the one hand it allows users to save money, on the other hand, it supports and motivates the developers of open source software. <br><br>  I would be happy to discuss and comments on the substance and form. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/27133/">https://habr.com/ru/post/27133/</a></p>
