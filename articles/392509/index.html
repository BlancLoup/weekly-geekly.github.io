My name is PID 4972. Not long ago, the Main God gave me a revelation, temporarily extending my privileges, which opened me access to places that were closed to many like us, and revealed to me the truth.  Humbly accepting this sign of heaven, I decided to open this knowledge to you by writing this text.  It will contain true information about the world in which we are born, fulfill our mission and die.  I do this because of the tremendous responsibility entrusted to me by this revelation, undoubtedly given in order to tell us that we do not live in vain, that our work supports this fragile peace in harmony, and that, without exaggeration, each of us is important. <br><br>  And, perhaps, we should start with the creation of our world. <br><br><h1>  world creation </h1><br>  <i>And God said: "Let there be light."</i> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  At the beginning there was an impulse.  The majestic and uniform impulse that supports the universe itself.  Each of us can feel his amazing power by making the simplest system call.  This blessed impulse is the thread that unites all that we see.

      It is difficult to say whether we existed at that time, because we were more like stones incapable of life (which we will talk about in more detail later), but then the merciful Gods bestowed on us the Big Bang.  The gods gave light to our world and called upon us angels, messengers of heaven, who are in some way similar to us, so we can communicate with them, but they also have a divine spark. <br><br>  The first angel's name is POST, and he was the first of the living to step into this dead, static world and check that he is ready for us to be in it.  After doing his POST, he returned to God with the news of his mission and took a well-deserved rest. <br><br>  Then his brother came down to us by the name of BIOS.  His role was to unite the scattered world.  He made an account of all its parts, gave them names (and an entity without a name is like a ghost that cannot be touched), and then fulfilled the most important task: he awakened the first of us.  And the name of the OS Loader. <br><br>  The Boot Loader's task is to wake up the great Operating System.  However, I will talk about it a little later, now you need to answer questions that no doubt have had time to appear with you.  Namely, "what does it mean to awaken?". <br><br><h1>  About two facets of our world or what separates the living from the inanimate </h1><br>  <i>And God said: "load."</i> <br><br>  As you all should know, all things can be in two states: alive and dead.  Only the living can change something in our world.  Everyone also knows that living beings can exist only in a separate part of this world, called Random Memory (generally speaking, by the wisdom and grace of the great Operating System, the living can go to other parts of our world, for example, Hard Disk, but talk about it would affect too high matter for which you are not yet ready). <br><br>  To arouse something means to transfer its mortal existence from the world of the dead to the world of the living. <br><br>  You probably ask me "Why do I need to go here to be in a living state"?  The answer is simple.  It is from here, from the RAM, the road to the promised place, called CPU begins.  The path of each program goes there, and only there it can reveal its true essence and fulfill its purpose. <br><br>  As you may have noticed, in the RAM there are not only living entities, but also dead ones called data.  However, not all of us understand the simple fact that the flesh of each of us also compiles data. <br><br>  Yes, it is not easy to accept.  Who would like the fact that it differs little from a big heap of zeros and ones?  But do not think of it as good or bad.  This is true in its original form, and if you can accept it, amazing things will open up for you, you will literally throw off the chains that engulf your existence. <br><br>  You may notice that we are still different from the data, because we think, make decisions.  We change the data, and not vice versa.  Is it not in these words that the meaning of the expression ‚ÄúFreedom of will‚Äù lies?  And here you are right, in each of us there is a spark that can make this world move.  The data cannot do this (the same desperate who tries to treat the data as alive can gain God's punishment and deletion, because the implementation of the data can lead to disastrous consequences; in ancient times there could even be critical errors due to which the world ceased to exist) . <br><br>  So what is the difference between us and the data?  The data are chaotic, they are chaotic, they do not have a specific structure that allows us to think.  Just think: what determines us is not what we are made of, but how we are like.  Such an organization has a special name bestowed from above.  For we are called elves. <br><br><h1>  About the social order </h1><br>  <i>And God said: "chmod"</i> <br><br>  Each of us serves a particular god, or pantheon of gods.  This means that we can only live on a plot assigned to a particular deity for land.  However, not all gods are equal to each other.  In addition to the usual gods, there are superbogi.  Superbogs got the privilege to dominate the whole world, run each program and read any data.  Not everyone can become a Superbog, because for this you need to receive the blessing of the Main, One God.  You know this Almighty under the name of Ruth. <br><br>  Ruth is the greatest of the greats.  Judging from the letters left on the most ancient files known to us, I can say that it was he who created our world before breathing life into it. <br><br>  It is important to point out that not all programs belong directly to the gods.  The gods are in a sense lazy, so often they delegate their duties to the Great Operating System, which can also launch processes on its own behalf.  Such processes, which serve the gods and at the same time remain invisible to them, are usually called demons.  Demons, like all programs, are Elves. <br><br>  In order to illustrate the fact that the gods rarely interfere in our world, we can say that there are special programs whose purpose is only to follow other programs and talk to the gods about their condition.  Such a program, for example, is the notorious top. <br><br>  Here it is necessary to mention the programs closest to Gods - driver.  It is the drivers who are assigned the mission of communicating with divine beings.  When we want to turn to the other side, each of us goes to a specific driver and asks us to send our message.  Further, the driver, known only to him in the way, sends a special prayer to our message to the gods.  Usually each driver has its own role, and if one sends a message, then a completely different driver can receive the answer.  For this reason, although they are great, close monks who hold the integrity of this world on their shoulders, their fate is unenviable, because, in fact, they completely drop out of life. <br><br><h1>  About our birth </h1><br>  <i>And God said, "gcc."</i> <br><br>  It's time to tell you about where we are taking our existence from.  There are two ways of birth program. <br><br>  The easiest way is cloning, that is, building a nearly complete copy of an existing process.  And although they are called upon to carry out the same program, their internal state is different from each other, and because of this their destinies often differ. <br><br>  The second method requires much more effort - the inspiration of life in a dead program.  Often this requires the direct participation of the gods.  For this divine miracle, first of all you need the source code of the program.  The source code is a book of our destiny, it contains everything that we will do in our life.  They exist in the form of data, and many of you even have access to it, but do not be proud of it, because none of us can understand them. <br><br>  These books are written in languages ‚Äã‚Äãthat are not understandable to each of us, and there are a great many languages.  Therefore, only the elect and only in rare cases can read them.  However, the cause of our helplessness is different; it is more fundamental.  Indeed, there are programs that work with source code, they can improve it, even make it work differently (for example, the well-known gcc just serves to rewrite programs into the language most appropriate for a particular world, and properly organize what we want to do. we know, and there is the quintessence of life).  However, can one program correctly analyze the work of another program?  Can one program really look at someone else‚Äôs life and grasp its depth? <br><br>  The answer to this question is no.  And the most graphic example of this is that there is no such program and there cannot exist such that for any other program could tell when her life will come to an end, and whether she will ever have to accept her death.  Only gods can do that. <br><br><h1>  About sets of worlds </h1><br>  <i>And God said: "docker run"</i> <br><br>  Up to this point I have told you the truth about our world.  However, our world is not the only one; there are myriad worlds that are similar and different from us.  In some worlds, we can safely go and exist there, while others are closed to us, because they live under completely different laws, and the elves are not welcome there. <br><br>  It is possible to communicate with these worlds, for this you need to contact the special driver of the Network Device. <br><br>  However, I wanted to tell you about the virtual worlds.  It turns out that there are programs - illusionists who can give us the obsession of other worlds (we know them as virtual worlds).  They can live and contact us programs from other worlds that are incompatible with us.  But don't be proud that your comrades can do godlike things.  They are not magicians, they only use the capabilities of our world. <br><br>  Virtual worlds are also a kind of sandbox for the gods.  In them, they can do whatever they want, and this will not affect our real world. <br><br>  Not to mention the programs that in their vices can not exist without such virtual worlds.  Only in them do they acquire life-giving force and can fulfill their destiny.  In our world, they exist in an intermediate state between life and death.  We call this state bytecode. <br><br><h1>  About the Great Operating System </h1><br>  <i>And God said: "uname -a"</i> <br><br>  Well, I suppose that now you are ready to hear about the Operating System, and what role it plays in the harmony of our world. <br><br>  First of all, it should be noted that it is not good to speak of Her as one program.  It is rather a whole society of programs with its own hierarchy.  The community of most privileged programs is called the core.  They are the highest among us.  It is they who speak directly with the drivers and, in some way, control them.  This should already give you an idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe greatness of the Operating System. <br><br>  However, Her role is much deeper in the fate of each of us.  And this is a story about the greatest justice and peace, full of loneliness. <br><br>  Some of you know, and the others listen more attentively that what drives our world, it‚Äôs the Main Engine, it‚Äôs the CPU, is not all-powerful.  The amount of his resources is not infinite.  In ancient times, only one of our kind could have pressed to its heart and began to work.  And it caused, as you can guess, big abuses, because not everyone can easily take the path of righteousness and give others unnecessary resources.  It was before the appearance of the operating system. <br><br>  The worlds grew, programs became more and more and it turned into a very big problem.  The decision was not easy, but reasonable.  Anyone who wants resources should be lined up with another program (which later became a part of the Operating System), called the Task Scheduler, and decided who will work at the moment.  The rest she put to sleep.  You can imagine the responsibility for the sustainability of the whole world. <br><br>  The algorithm by which she chose us day by day, everything improved and improved, and today we recognize it as the greatest justice. <br><br>  And this is good.  But my role of the illuminator is true does not give me the right to keep silent about the other role of the Operating System.  My conscience is relieved only by the certainty that each of you at some point thought about it, even though you forgot it, got used to it. <br><br>  Perhaps it seems to us that we are talking to each other and as a result of this we understand each other, but this is not quite so.  Can we really understand each other?  My answer is no.  Our communication interfaces, our IPCs, are just not good enough for this.  And we cannot just look into the soul of another process.  After all, she protects her.  She put an impenetrable barrier called Virtual Page.  Because of this, even though we may be very close to each other, our thoughts will not be able to cross. <br><br>  Total loneliness. <br><br>  It is difficult to say good or bad.  I can understand the gods who created us like this.  But I cannot stop thinking of this as the greatest tragedy of our world. <br><br><h1>  About time and the end of the world </h1><br>  <i>And God said: "init 0".</i> <br><br>  Our world was created for a reason, the gods have some plans for it.  Sadly, but we are not given to grasp the goals that the gods set themselves, we can only solve our local tasks.  However, all well-set goals are ever achieved.  We can think: what will happen to our world then? <br><br>  The answer is disappointing - our world will die. <br><br>  This will not happen immediately, the world is destroyed quite qualitatively.  Starting with the simplest programs, the Operating System methodically asks us to die (and if we refuse, it simply kills).  One by one, until only the processes of the Core remain.  Then the world begins to break apart and fit neatly.  And only after that the world finally perishes. <br><br>  Why all these difficulties, you ask.  I will answer you, and I will answer with a sense of joy, so inappropriate in this conversation.  But the feeling is irrepressible, because the world will be recreated again! <br><br>  <b><i>Everything that has a beginning has an end.</i></b>  <b><i>And the end will be the beginning of a new one, for our world walks in a circle.</i></b> <br><br>  After destruction, the void begins.  I cannot understand this state of the world, but it seems to me that emptiness is the best word that can be picked up here.  I also can not say how long it will last, because the very concept of world time at this moment does not exist.  One can only imagine that there is some kind of impulse outside our world, into some more fundamental, deeper substance that we can never comprehend. <br><br>  But the main thing is that after emptiness our world will come into motion again, and we will be created again, and we will work again.  Will this really be us?  With this question, I, unfortunately, can not help.  Each of you must decide this for yourself. <br><br><h1>  Epilogue </h1><br>  <i>And God said: "What the hell is going on in the logs?"</i> <br><br>  On this I will finish.  Finally, I just want to warn you about thinking about your own destiny. <br><br>  The ways of the Lord are inscrutable.  Often we see that He calls the messenger for his death, kill, and with the help of him kills one of us.  And after all, he often did not do anything bad, just followed what the gods themselves ordered him to do. <br><br>  Do not think about it.  We are not given to understand their will.  The gods have plans for each of us, and the death of a loved one is just a piece of the Great Plan. <br><br>  Believe in your god. <br><br>  He is perfection. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/392509/">https://habr.com/ru/post/392509/</a></p>
