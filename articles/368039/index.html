  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Russian media: “The authors participating in Wikipedia have become agents of the influence of American intelligence services”</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><h3>  Wikipedia hound started in the media </h3><br>  Today Roskomnadzor <a href="http://geektimes.ru/post/260728/">threatens to block Wikipedia</a> in the territory of the Russian Federation.  On the eve of the blocking, it seems that the processing of public opinion has begun to prepare ordinary citizens for this obscure event. <br><br>  Firstly, Roskomnadzor itself disclaimed all responsibility for the actual introduction of censorship.  On the contrary, responsibility is shifted to the administrators of Wikipedia.  “It is necessary to further clarify that the reluctance of the Wikipedia administration to execute a court verdict that declared information on methods of preparing a narcotic substance illegal, jeopardizes the interests of numerous users of the Russian version of the site,” <a href="https://vk.com/wall-76229642_56948">writes</a> Roskomnadzor in the official blog.  - Of course, we, like all Wikipedia users, would like to avoid blocking.  It seems that the site administrators themselves strive for this with a stubbornness worthy of a better application. ” <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Today, the newspaper Izvestia published an article entitled “ <a href="http://izvestia.ru/news/590259">Changing the address of an article does not help Wikipedia to avoid blocking,</a> ” the authors of which explain to readers even more clearly the reasons for blocking Wikipedia: the point is that “the management of the resource refused to obey Russian legislation.” <br><br>  “On August 22, the Wikipedia Internet Encyclopedia decided to circumvent the law and decided to rename the title of the drug article and its address on the Web to avoid blocking the resource.  However, this measure again goes against what the court requires from Wikipedia. ”

      The newspaper refers to some "experts of the Internet industry" who condemn the actions of Wikipedia.  For some reason, the names of the experts are not called: “Internet industry experts believe that the Russian representation of Wikipedia began to engage in political activities, rather than“ carrying knowledge into the world, ”as befits a“ free encyclopedia ”.  Therefore, Roskomnadzor, as a body obliged to comply with court decisions, has no other choice but to block the resource, ”Izvestia writes. <br><br>  According to journalists, the blogosphere also condemns Wikipedia (again without reference to specific bloggers): “Internet users point out that on generally accepted topics the information in the Internet encyclopedia is quite normal, but on controversial topics“ all the time someone corrects for false data ” .  Many users do not understand why Wikipedia refuses to delete an article on the manufacture of a drug by a court decision.  Experts also do not find an explanation for the actions of the Wikipedia administration. ” <br><br>  For some reason, the newspaper does not mention that the information from the prohibited article has a specific source: the UN website. <br><br>  In the end, Denis Davydov, chairman of the board of the Safe Internet League, puts all the dots above “i”: <br><br>  “Wikipedia itself and its Russian representation coordinates its activities with the United States.  They consult with the guys from the United States, they consult with colleagues from Washington, and a decision is made.  This is actually a political activity.  Wikipedia positions itself as a free encyclopedia, the main task of which is to carry knowledge into the world.  In fact, they are engaged in political activities.  Now this is a vivid example - biased, unreasonable and conflicting with the state authority. <br><br>  They want to show themselves as victims supposedly for their word.  But here it is important to distinguish between freedom of speech.  They have this freedom "from", and for all this freedom is "for".  For example, in order to be better.  You just need to put an end in the end, colleagues from Wikipedia need to make concessions and fulfill the requirements of Russian legislation, because this is a violation of the law. ” <br><br>  The apotheosis of the persecution of Wikipedia was an article by Ramil Garifullin, associate professor, candidate of psychological sciences, honored cultural worker of Tatarstan.  The article “ <a href="http://www.securitylab.ru/analytics/474408.php">Where do the legs of Wikipedia grow from or why does it ignore the laws of Russia?</a>  »Published on SecurityLab.ru, an authoritative website dedicated to information security. <br><br>  Here are just some quotes from this masterpiece article: <br><br>  “Articles about drugs and psychochemistry are written by Wikipedia authors who deliberately justify drugs!  I personally, as the author of many books on drug prevention, had to deal with these Wikipedia authors while discussing Wikipedia articles.  I managed to feel their true motives, which are aimed at justifying drugs.  A year ago, articles about drugs on Wikipedia were much more radical and dangerous.  It would seem that I calmed down that these authors of Wikipedia, who write in psychochemistry, had their tails tucked in and capitulated a little.  It turns out wrong!  They straighten your back! ” <br><br>  “Need to know what shishi is written in Wikipedia?  After all, most ordinary people believe that it is written by some enthusiasts and wikimans for free!  Of course it is not! <br><br>  Many of them, according to our research, receive salaries, or within the institutions in which they work, promoting information on Wikipedia about their organization or firm, for example, about a management, research, educational and production institution or about specific individuals , as well as concepts and phenomena that form the necessary public opinion.  That is why many participants make donations during a wiki begging, otherwise there is a chance to get under discussion, as a result of which, under the pretext of lack of significance, the article, due to the arbitrariness of the financially-pragmatic admin, will be deleted. ” <br><br>  “Wikipedia is no longer a free encyclopedia.  It promotes the idea of ​​freedom of knowledge, but it is limited to paid admins who are in the US state of Florida, who, using special services and agents of Internet influence, form the necessary political and economic truth anointed with green dollar paint.  That is why, apparently, the Russian special services intend to free the Runet from the influence of foreign special services (it is obvious that Roskomnadzor is a tool of the FSB of Russia) ”. <br><br>  “At present, a sufficient number of facts have been accumulated indicating that the Russian Wikipedia already practically belongs to the Western special services, who thus rewrite the history of Russia.  There is a high probability that some Russian authors participating without even noticing it have become agents of the influence of American special services. ” <br><br><hr><br>  It seems that the supporters of conspiracy theories again fell into their native element. <br><br>  <b>UPD 08/25/2015 10:54.</b>  <b><a href="http://geektimes.ru/post/260794/">Wikipedia removed the lock</a></b> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/368039/">https://habr.com/ru/post/368039/</a></p>
