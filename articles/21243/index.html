  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Eight trends from the stars of Internet marketing Runet</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/0f7/7f5/05d/0f77f505d51aa5972d129bf229ea2341.jpg" width="300" height="225" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="left"><br>  Recently, well-known IT specialists from Moscow and St. Petersburg (Sergey Kotyrev, Leonid Rumyantsev, Ilya Poyarkov, Alexey Morozov and others) took part in the conference ‚ÄúIncomeConf II Effective Internet Business‚Äù in Pushkin, near St. Petersburg.  When discussing topics relevant for Runet (search technologies, partner programs, startups, traffic conversion ...), professionals recognized in their field expressed a number of opinions that reflect the main trends in the development of modern Internet marketing, on the basis of which we outlined the most striking business trends in modern Internet: <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  1. Offline communication is one of the driving forces of online.  Publishers of the new magazine Terminal.ru believe that online today is at a stage in its development when successful growth requires an influx of people and information from outside.  ‚ÄúCollaboration and information sharing outside the Internet ensures further growth of the industry and a high level of income for all,‚Äù Roman Domorenok, editor-in-chief of Terminal.ru magazine, addresses readers.  The main audience of the magazine, which rely on publishers - those who do business on the web. <br><br>  2. Use original content.  Leonid Storchevoy, editor-in-chief of the PerevodBy project (Online Translation Services), recommends filling sites with original content: copywriting, rewriting, user-generated content and translation.  Customers who copy foreign-language text do not need to be afraid of foreign copyright holders: the translated material is a new, independent text, which means original content. <br><br>  3. The main threat to contextual advertising is a slip of advertising budgets. <br>  ‚ÄúDo not click where it is not necessary!‚Äù - Alexey Morozov, the head of the special department of the company ‚ÄúRunner‚Äù, called on the participants of the conference.  According to Alexey, the advertiser suffers most from inappropriate clicks (ineffective spending of advertising budgets).  The second ones are hit by affiliate programs (reputation falls, budgets fall), Webmasters follow them, and ultimately the market as a whole, capturing designers, programmers and copywriters ... There is no panacea for sklik, but, for example, ‚ÄúRunner‚Äù, as told Morozov, boasts a three-level system of checking traffic: online and offline filters, as well as manually.

      4. Link exchange - saving time for the optimizer and the opportunity to earn for the web-master. <br>  It is in this sequence (in order of reducing the number of users) according to the analysis of the market for buying and selling Runet's links conducted by Armee (a well-known optimizer) that the main players are located: <br>  1.Sape <br>  2.Xap <br>  3.Mainlink <br>  4.Clx <br>  5.Propage <br>  6.Promtext <br>  Referring to the west, Armee notes: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs hard to imagine that the link market is dead.  In the West, often without buying links just can not do, despite the emergence of new filters search engines.  Yes, and a certain number of requests in principle is difficult to promote without reference. "  Optimal placement, according to Armee: 3-4 links to a page, not more than 30% of the site pages. <br><br>  5. The future of the domains of the form dog.rf.  So says Ilya Poyarkov, domain investor, project coordinator for DNDialog.com.  In general, as Ilya notes, it is difficult to analyze the Runet's domain market - cybersquatters are in no hurry to report transaction amounts, fearing the tax burden.  Unlike the west, where domain sales are auctioned, and DNjournal.com keeps weekly charts. <br><br>  6. Provocateur on the forum - the key to the activity of visitors.  Advocate Devil advises to start on forums to generate communication activity Nikita Gurbashkov, PR-manager of the LiveIdea.ru project.  This is a kind of ‚Äúdecoy duck‚Äù, a person who, with his ambiguous, even aggressive comments, will ‚Äúwiggle‚Äù users, evoking stormy emotions of members of the forum, and, therefore, increase interest in the site being promoted. <br><br>  7. Social networks can earn money on puzomerii.  So calls Leonid Rumyantsev (studio Usability. Ru) the desire of people to be better than others.  As an example, Leonid cited dating sites, where 80% of the profits are paid for the first positions in the ranking and the first places of the show.  In general, according to Leonid, the social network should be monetized with extreme caution.  The more accurate this happens, the more painless it will take the community, the more profit the site will bring.  The quieter you go, the further you'll get. <br><br>  8. The labor market is experiencing a shortage of IT people.  Perhaps, there was no second person at the conference who was listened to just as attentively as Efremova Anastasia.  Nastya, HeadHunter marketing and PR manager, St. Petersburg raised the issue of ‚Äúdaily bread‚Äù.  It turns out that employers, on the example of St. Petersburg, are willing to pay up to $ 5,000 to programmers, developers, web designers, engineers, analysts, technical writers, in general, IT specialists.  True, technical directors at the same time not only lose in salary, but also less in demand. <br><br>  Some of these thoughts will seem controversial, but for this they expressed themselves in the framework of live communication, so that people could discuss them in their own professional environment.  Therefore, if the task of the conference was to meet people doing business on the Web, then it fulfilled it: someone found new partners, someone talked, someone had a rest.  Let's see how it affects online. <br><br>  <a href="http://blog-maye.ru/%3Fp%3D39">Original article</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/21243/">https://habr.com/ru/post/21243/</a></p>
