  <section class="page js-page"><h1>RuTracker can be blocked for users from the Russian Federation, as in the Netherlands are struggling with similar problems?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Not so long ago, one of the largest peer-to-peer services in the world reported a possible blocking of access to its resource for all users from the Russian Federation.  Resource delivered ultimatum requirements to remove more than 320,000 hands or be blocked.  Detailed information is available <a href="http://rutracker.org/forum/viewtopic.php%3Ft%3D5106232">on the website of the tracker</a> .  There is a vote on this issue. <br><br>  By the way, resource owners are mistaken; as a result of blocking, the site will become inaccessible not only in Russia, but also for the majority of Belarus users.  Beltelecom is the main backbone provider of Belarus and uses Rostelecom‚Äôs foreign channels.  That is, Belarus, in fact, sees the foreign Internet through Russia, as well as Kazakhstan and other nearby countries.  Ukraine, fortunately, does not go on this list and indeed in Ukraine access to the site will not be blocked. <br><br>  In this publication, we would like to touch on the topic of violation of rights in general, the legality of such projects, methods of dealing with violations, as well as learn your attitude to this issue.  After all, it is important to eliminate the causes, not the consequences. <a name="habracut"></a>

      It should be noted that such sites have always been on the verge of law, not only in the Russian Federation.  This is not the first attempt to block the work of the resource.  Since February 18, 2010, the Ru-Center registrar suspended the delegation of the Torrents.ru domain, as a result of which the domain name was changed to the current one.  At the moment, the administration of the resource is actively cooperating with the right holders; nevertheless, respected Russian organizations for the protection of rights and business interests, find such cooperation insufficient. <br><br>  Of course, it is difficult to make any assessment here without detailed trials, but definitely the blocking of the activity of the resource must take place in the legal field. <br><br>  For example, in the Netherlands there is an organization BREIN, leading litigation with the owners of resources that violate whose rights or even Data Centers that provide services and do not respond to notifications of violations.  As a result, a website that violates the laws of the Netherlands may be closed, and often moved outside the country to a country with more loyal legislation, if such content is allowed there.  However, it is worth noting that in this case, blocking access to the resource for residents of the Netherlands is not carried out, since the Internet is free space, and, among other things, such blocking would probably violate the constitutional rights of citizens. <br><br>  It is also worth noting that RuTracker has been located in the Netherlands for a long time, and the same BREIN has nothing against it.  Among other things, you can always send a complaint to ICAAN, block a domain if serious violations occur.  But for some reason, these methods of influence are used extremely rarely.  Restricting access to an audience for a resource can certainly be an effective method, but this is not always and not always legal and is essentially on the verge of the law, as are resources with non-authorial content.  In addition, those wishing to gain access will find methods.  The same OpenVPN can provide not only encryption, but also trouble-free access.  And in order to really resolve the issue, it is important to still deal with the causes, and not with the consequence. <br><br>  And how do you feel about this situation?  Do you agree with the restrictions?  Will you look for workarounds in case of access restriction to something? </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/270423/">https://habr.com/ru/post/270423/</a></p>
