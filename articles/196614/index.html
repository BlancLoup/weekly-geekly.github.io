So, on September 23, 2013, the third sports programming championship finished - the Russian Code Cup 2013. The first place went to Petr Mitrichev, repeating his own achievement in 2011, the second - Gennady Korotkevich, who won this year together with the ITMO team in the ACM ICPC finals in St. Petersburg  The third was Dmitry Dzhulgakov, the third time participating in the finals of the championship, but for the first time won a prize. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage3/56d/103/e21/56d103e21bc5fe809419ef9c0e4ca215.jpg"><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  In addition to the three main awards, which this year amounted to $ 10,000, $ 5,000 and $ 3,000 for the first, second and third places, respectively, two more special prizes were awarded in the final: <br><ul><li>  Pavel Kunyavsky received the shortest (and correct) solution of the iPad mini and applause in the nomination ‚ÄúShortness - Sister of the Company‚Äù established by the representatives of the press (fifth place in the final) </li><li>  in the nomination ‚ÄúThe fastest (and correct) solution‚Äù, the prize to Dmitry Zhukov (the twentieth place in the final) was presented by Nikolai Nikiforov, Minister of Communications and Mass Media of the Russian Federation. </li></ul>

A master class on managing them took place right before the award ceremony.  Not without emergencies - one drone could not hold on to a sharp bend and crashed.  :( Be careful with piloting! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage3/768/5c7/67c/7685c767cf923ba6e3747819623d5467.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage3/02d/b38/39c/02db3839cb8c51c8dc1160c6ae446d96.jpg"><br><br>  We congratulate the finalists and participants of the third championship.  And now - a little about the championship itself and the organization of the final. <br><br>  <i><b>Facts and Figures</b></i> <br><br><ul><li>  The final was attended by 50 people, 26 of whom were finalists of the Russian Code Cup and in 2012 </li><li>  Slightly more than half of the finalists from Russia - 58%, 18% from Ukraine, 10% from Belarus, the same number came to us from the USA, one person from Bulgaria and one from Switzerland </li><li>  Age of finalists - from 18 to 29 years </li></ul><br><br>  In fact, the event lasted two days: it began on Sunday evening from the meeting of the finalists in our office, and on Monday morning the championship started.  During Saturday and Sunday, the guys gathered in Moscow.  The finalists came from almost all of Russia, from the CIS countries, from Europe and America.  By the way, in order to meet and take to the hotel the finalists arriving by different flights and different groups, it was necessary to organize logistics very ingeniously.  Since we planned to hold the entire event this year in our new office, we decided to settle the finalists nearby, at the Renaissance Monarch Center hotel. <br><br>  On Sunday evening, all the guys gathered at the hotel and from there already arrived at the Mail.Ru Group office, where they were waiting for dinner and a meeting with our technical experts. <br><br>  Before the final, we decided to show participants the place where the decisive stage of the competition will take place.  After dinner, Mail.Ru Group employees conducted an excursion around the office for the children, showed their jobs, told them about the development services and technologies that they use every day.  The tour ended on the 26th floor.  Here, the finalists met with Dmitry Grishin and in an informal atmosphere talked with each other, and with employees of Mail.Ru Group. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage3/a02/9a0/649/a029a064983ab88efb9c1e0912e715a2.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage3/abf/08a/1a1/abf08a1a13b2218bffe09a25350154cd.jpg"><br><br>  The same evening, the guys got acquainted with their places, where the next day they will solve the tasks of the RCC 2013 finals, met with the jury chairman Andrey Stankevich and Codeforces project leader Mikhail Mirzayanov.  We made sure that all places have access to the Internet and their own laptops are easily connected.  And Mikhail Mirzayanov also managed to interview several finalists.  We planned to show these interviews the next day during the broadcast. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage3/0ed/6c5/da4/0ed6c5da4cd9bcd48c583d55993208dc.jpg"><br><br>  The contest started on Monday, September 23rd, at 10:45.  The finalists settled down at their workplaces on the 23rd floor, and Mikhail Mirzayanov and Andrei Kravchenko settled in the wheelhouse of commentators.  Began live broadcast.  By the way, how persistently during the previous weeks we prepared and polished the broadcast script!  How many unexpected and difficult moments had to be taken into account, corrected, rewritten.  We really wanted to make the broadcast interesting for other sports programmers, and for viewers who are far from this topic. <br>  During the contest, Mikhail and Andrei invited guests into their cabin.  Among them were the founder of the RCC Dmitry Zevelev, the author of the project SnarkNews Oleg Khristenko, the chairman of the jury of the RCC 2013 Andrei Stankevich. <br><br>  The culmination of the broadcast from the competition hall was Mikhail Mirzayanov‚Äôs teleconference with the event host, Anton Komolov.  At the end of the teleconference, after Anton's sacramental phrase: ‚ÄúMichael, frost of the scoreboard!‚Äù The standings were frozen, and only the judges knew about the future course of the competition. <br><br>  By the way, it was not by chance that Anton was chosen as the leading RCC - he himself studied at the physical-mat school and graduated from Bauman Moscow State Technical University, so we thought that IT should be close to him and we were not mistaken.  In addition, he has an excellent manner of reference, he joked a lot, and from time to time the whole room exploded with laughter.  I want to say a special thank you to Anton - it was great. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage3/5d7/05a/c07/5d705ac07a6735e886e0d85cc24d6ab0.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage3/cfa/661/313/cfa6613138ffd82c80bb8d301825f3b0.jpg"><br><br>  The guests began to gather in a large hall on the second floor of the office at 11:30.  A few weeks before the final, when we sent invitations to guests, we decided to call on the event not only IT experts, programmers, managers of IT projects, but also students, schoolchildren and school teachers of computer science and mathematics.  The idea was that the championship on sports programming gathered around itself both accomplished professionals and undecided children in the future: this contributes to the maximum popularization of the programmer's profession. <br><br>  While there was a contest, in the large hall on the first floor of the office, the guests watched the technological installations, and from 13:20 the speakers, <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/mailru/blog/194214/">Dmitry Sklyarov, Ken Goldberg and Edward Jordon, took turns speaking to the audience</a> .  Inviting the speakers, we tried to make the reports interesting to the maximum number of guests and covered the main topic from different sides - the presentations were about the future development, about robotics, and about applied aspects of analysis and programming. <br><br>  Famous illusionists Marco Tempest and Simon Piero made speeches between the master classes of the speakers.  The idea to invite illusionists arose not by chance, we wanted to dilute the speeches of the show component speakers. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage3/878/6c1/625/8786c1625773cf6e058e916177e89f5d.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage3/220/e49/353/220e49353b9cb4c87e5c74f28459eca7.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage3/12e/ee1/254/12eee12546b83ce68ca719ab5534f8d7.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage3/aa2/b8a/9bb/aa2b8a9bb1143053b4615105d1186f17.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage3/9e2/03f/51a/9e203f51a6ddf93a85b1a333f9b247f6.jpg"><br><br>  After the contest ended and dinner, the finalists joined the guests in the large hall, who greeted them with loud applause.  And soon the award ceremony began. <br><br>  In past years at the RCC, all three winners received small cups, in the same year we decided to make a single big cup for the winner - the strongest sports programmer!  It turned out even more honorable. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage3/56d/103/e21/56d103e21bc5fe809419ef9c0e4ca215.jpg"><br><br>  Simultaneously with the reception, the autograph session of Edward Yordon began.  For half an hour more than 200 books ‚ÄúThe Way of Kamikazes‚Äù, signed by the author, were dismantled. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage3/d67/37f/5bf/d6737f5bf1c8d20506902ed0fdb23a26.jpg"><br><br>  During the reception, guests talked and took pictures with speakers and distinguished guests.  Our special guest, Anatoly Wasserman, attracted special attention. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage3/bab/9b8/57d/bab9b857de0bd574a2dc340036d99eb7.jpg"><br><br>  After the reception, the finalists were taken to the RCC traditional journey along the Moscow River, which has already become three years in a row.  There, to the songs of "The Adventures of Electronics", accompanying dinner with board games, we completed this long and busy day! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage3/c37/d66/4d7/c37d664d7642543fbedd4206fa5f80a9.jpg"><br><br>  PS: The next day after the event, we conducted a survey among guests, and here are the reviews we received: <br>  - Hold the event better on weekends or in the afternoon. <br>  - Some speeches of the speakers were very long. <br>  - In my opinion, the main thing in the intellectual competition is the tasks: you have to imagine exactly what the participants are competing for.  Therefore, it would be worthwhile to actively promote tasks, for example, to put leaflets with conditions in bags that were given to guests.  If I understand correctly, there are no obstacles to this - the conditions of the tasks cease to be secret at the moment of the start of the competition.  Now I look <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/mailru/blog/195164/">at</a> them <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/mailru/blog/195164/">on Habrahabr</a> , really like ... <br>  - The only negative - holding in the working day, everything else was on top. <br><br>  <b>Anatoly Wasserman:</b> ‚ÄúIt reminded me a lot of the atmosphere of those contests of young programmers, in which I myself once participated.  The tasks have since become more difficult, the means are much more convenient, but the atmosphere has remained the same. ‚Äù <br><br>  <b>Alexander Dyachenko, Upgrade magazine:</b> ‚ÄúThe president and founder of the Mail.Ru Group Dmitry Grishin is such a simple dude.  Like him and the whole event. ‚Äù <br><br>  <b>Sergey Bobrovsky, PC Week:</b> ‚ÄúThis year it is only the second programmer organization (out of a couple of dozen I have visited) where developers are treated like human beings and do not tend to stuff into stuffy rooms under the pretext of lack of space nose ... Organization of the event show for five plus.  By the way, having plenty of food throughout the event is a sure sign of the professional organization of the process and respect for visitors. ‚Äù <br><br>  The opinion of the guests is very important to us, and next time we will organize the RCC according to the wishes. <br><br>  If you have not been to the event, watch the video to feel the atmosphere: <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/658LYcuXHp0%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=25657,15700022,15700043,15700186,15700191,15700253,15700256&amp;usg=ALkJrhijD9extQoz-4uzyUjnBUC7h-wSzA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  <i>Dmitry Voloshin,</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Director of Research and Education Mail.Ru Group</i> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/196614/">https://habr.com/ru/post/196614/</a></p>
