How do the promalpy on the tower Lakhta Center</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  In the discussion to the previous <a href="https://habr.com/ru/company/lakhtacenter/blog/450836/">post</a> , industrial climbers who are now working on the Lakhta Center tower were in the focus of attention.  And so we decided to tell you more about these guys, whose exciting work makes you feel both keen envy and the thought - ‚ÄúOh, no way !!!‚Äù, usually expressed much more briefly and succinctly.  If you share this adrenaline-charged emotional dualism, then we invite you to the front!  Today - hang out with climbers! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/_x/ob/q3/_xobq3_rbmrasd8mzcbx_worrtg.jpeg" alt="image"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h3>  What's the point of this? </h3><br>  When it comes to climbers, as a rule, there are two irreconcilable camps.  Some people think that people who devote all their free time to climbing cliffs, risking their lives every minute, and climbing to a height where all living things die from lack of oxygen and severe frost are just adrenaline maniacs. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/le/to/82/leto82csfdpbkerdq1p_tnntaiy.jpeg" alt="image">

      Others admire the brave ones who are ready to give everything to look at the world from the summit of the highest mountain or follow the route that nobody has ever walked. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ve/db/mt/vedbmtgrusw3yes7jrphn9tbfsc.jpeg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/sd/mi/kz/sdmikzfibx5jnxlr49p0kp_k-oe.jpeg" alt="image"><br><br>  Truth is somewhere in the middle.  On the one hand, overcoming difficulties to achieve the goal, striving for the new is the most important part of human essence.  On the other hand, it is probably not particularly reasonable to talk about a justified risk for the sake of conquering unexplored peaks, dying in a giant queue on Everest. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/9y/mi/yj/9ymiyj2boebie955abjm_illk0a.jpeg" alt="image"><br><br>  However, there are people who spend most of their lives at dizzying heights, not having a reliable point of support, but at the same time they are engaged in a business that even the most skeptical expert will not call meaningless.  We are talking about industrial climbers. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/fg/e5/i8/fge5i8pzwy_asrp_3ldlyvoqbry.jpeg" alt="image"><br><br><h3>  Not romance.  Or yes? </h3><br>  Industrial climbers themselves say that romance in their work is at most 10%, and the rest is hard work.  But somewhere here - cunning.  Judging by the self-made by installers working on the construction of Lakhta Center, the work did not become routine for them. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/fj/us/ft/fjusftvxubmayeelqxh7yavk7vk.jpeg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/jw/ps/vz/jwpsvzmz6ytfyswbly4pb8vloey.jpeg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/_h/7p/vo/_h7pvoi-dwpiw0sfxd2vr4qzdsu.jpeg" alt="image"><br><br>  Climbers from the Ilros Montazh and Almaz Group companies share the tower on Lakhta.  Their current tasks are the installation of <abbr title="Facade maintenance system">SOF</abbr> rails and barrier lights on the steeple.  Lakhta Center - among the most interesting and complex objects on which it was necessary to work. <br><br><blockquote>  Sergey Belousov, industrial climber "Almaz Group": <br><br>  - This tower is the first of its kind and, probably, will be the only such one.  Still, the tallest building in Europe, and the view from the top is nothing like that.  Everyone knows that there are very beautiful sunsets in St. Petersburg, and from there they are even more beautiful. </blockquote><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/mx/_k/n8/mx_kn8awkr2tonpyebs7gsgmuc4.jpeg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ee/ri/5h/eeri5htt_a-jp2njqsnhu-sefxa.jpeg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/39/om/z8/39omz8l-uw9ws20uks7fv2agwla.jpeg" alt="image"><br><br><h3>  Through the heavenly gates </h3><br>  Before going to work through the technical gates, located on the 87th level of the tower, compulsory instruction: the shift receives the task, disassemble who and what he does, pick up equipment and tools. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/k8/lu/qo/k8luqoqhoz1dbydkrx4oocuoera.jpeg" alt="image"><br>  <i>"All nodes must be in Feng Shui"</i> <br><br>  Next - inspection equipment and not the closest way almost to the top of the skyscraper. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/dj/7j/f2/dj7jf2r8tvhpaxggcdwy2xje4oa.jpeg" alt="image"><br><br>  The ‚ÄúHeavenly Gate‚Äù, from which the crane of the facade maintenance system (FSS) will go in the future, and now the climbers go to work, deserve a special mention.  They are located on the technical floor and represent a complex of 20 ‚Äúsecret doors‚Äù - special facade sections around the tower‚Äôs perimeter.  When you need to go to the facade of the building, the sections automatically open up inside.  The control system of this design "sees" all sections at the same time, determines the climatic risks and connects the gate with the elements of the SOF. <br>  Here is the open section: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/nf/kf/a2/nfkfa2cp_tl0vt8yy2ckc65zws8.jpeg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/bw/od/qo/bwodqokiri6j5hct52gr1vavsiu.jpeg" alt="image"><br>  <i>The door to the "Zafasadye"</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/a7/md/cx/a7mdcxkkuzfrxym1vvtiqqcrebk.jpeg" alt="image"><br>  <i>Going to work</i> <br><br><h3>  Sandwich on a string </h3><br>  Before going to the facade - a mandatory photo. <br><blockquote>  Maxim Gerliman, Chief Specialist of the Department of Labor Protection and Fire Safety at IFC Lahta Center: <br>  - Before going out onto the facade, climbers are examined by a responsible manager and take pictures of them for daily reports.  In the photo it should be clear that the personal equipment is complete, all the fixtures are in order, and the ropes used for the descent are securely fastened.  All tools used by installers must be attached to the climbers to prevent falling down.  For the same reason, a special hardware catcher was even developed for the installation work of the SOF rails. </blockquote>  The main part of the tools is placed in such small bags with a puff: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/0-/zr/ih/0-zrihu9f0n16vm32xgosd1cgqg.jpeg" alt="image"><br>  <i>The weight of each can reach 15 kilograms.</i> <br><br>  From there, as if from a magician's hat, keys, screwdrivers and nippers appear at the right moment, all on a leash: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/gx/oi/lj/gxoilj28tnuddtn_-stkvne5ksi.jpeg" alt="image"><br><br>  Some tool is separate, but also connected with its climber as an inseparable link: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/on/5t/fu/on5tfuvy2lu37xj0wtn4w0bgc7u.jpeg" alt="image"><br><br>  And still the signalmen are on duty below, preventing outsiders from entering the danger zone.  Climbers joke that they do not have a snack while working, just because everything must be tied, and it is impossible to tie a sandwich. <br><br><h3>  Four </h3><br>  Promalpinista cell - link: there is an observer at the top, an observer below and two people at the montage.  On the steeple installation can go by three. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/vb/tn/e1/vbtne13hhopgxdjj4ofc44ydzus.jpeg" alt="image"><br><br>  But one by one at a height does not work - this is the law, because even such a minor nuisance, like a tangled rope for a loner can be a problem. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/5l/wh/q8/5lwhq8qff4f6isfr7qpo-khs1gc.jpeg" alt="image"><br><br>  As a rule, the links have a stable composition.  People are friends, communicate, work or not work.  And people who work together uncomfortable, do not fall into one link. <br><blockquote>  Alexander Lugovoi, work manager from Almaz Group: <br><br>  - Once a person was even banished from an object, because he could not get along with anyone.  People went down and said to the foreman: "Do not put me with him anymore, it is impossible to work together."  And when this man went through all the links and did not work with anyone, of course, he had to leave </blockquote><h3>  Weather </h3><br>  Works behind the facade go all season and in different weather conditions.  Chill climbers love less than heat. <br><blockquote>  Sergey Kolpakov, industrial climber "Ilros Montazh": <br><br>  - A lot of clothes have to be worn.  She is heavy, starts to cling to everything, hinders movement.  Even if necessary, it will not be possible to quickly descend.  In addition, a lot of energy goes to keep warm.  In the heat, you can take water with you, but in -15, what will you take with you? <br></blockquote>  Heavy and bulky clothing is not at all like a sheepskin sheepskin coat, as is drawn.  At the height and with many hours of work, such sensations can be obtained in a moment even from weightless and warm membrane anatomical overalls - a typical winter equipment of industrial alpinist. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/5y/7u/s2/5y7us2vrcq8oocr6oazmeqfclzy.jpeg" alt="image"><br>  <i>Winter outfit</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/px/gf/t3/pxgft3cvhjztvrsa9pjn13lklrc.jpeg" alt="image"><br><br>  In the wind the work is limited.  According to the rules, the critical force is 15 m / s, but often the work stops even at 10 m / s. <br><br>  The subjective basis for the climber to stop working and come down to the ground is a feeling of discomfort. <br><blockquote>  Alexander Lugovoi, work manager from Almaz Group: <br><br>  - It‚Äôs normal when a person decides to stop working, if he is not ready for it, feels insecure, he doesn‚Äôt like something, it even seems that the wind is coming now.  Nobody needs a climber who will hang at a high altitude and will need to be rescued ... <br></blockquote>  Climbers never work in a thunderstorm.  At the same time, they are the only people who see live traces of last September‚Äôs ‚Äúbattles‚Äù of the tower with lightning, when they powerfully attacked the spire three times.  It didn‚Äôt cause harm to the skyscraper, and yet the heavenly guest left spiers such small marks: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/gs/m8/l8/gsm8l8j90tqgn85tlz9tf0ekhdc.jpeg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/eo/h1/zo/eoh1zo38oi4mqkumzslvgmtfive.jpeg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/pc/9i/04/pc9i044ahx290j2ymuascek1h2m.jpeg" alt="image"><br>  <i>"Scars" for memory.</i>  <i>It was an honest battle.</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/i8/gw/ku/i8gwkuuuf_rr2yboedoth2jwoqa.jpeg" alt="image"><br>  <i>Photo by Anton Galakhov "Thunderstorm in Petersburg".</i>  <i>Read more about how lightning protection works and how the tower was made by a lightning conductor of a city scale, read <a href="https://habr.com/ru/company/lakhtacenter/blog/434212/">here.</a></i> <br><br><h3>  Lakhta, as you hear, welcome! </h3><br>  All communication is upstairs - by radio, although it also catches mobile.  Usually the phone is uncovered not for the sake of talk - you need to take a photo or video in the process.  And sometimes just for fun.  Where else can you see the sun, when the clouds are immediately and under your feet, and above your head? <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/f6/-a/k8/f6-ak8rfglmsys1e2w7_edz2que.jpeg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/v-/b3/wd/v-b3wd-wd6g_ngiq_sdtjfgcqme.jpeg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/j5/ly/4i/j5ly4i1jr2bfzgn4who96zntpsu.jpeg" alt="image"><br>  <i>Says and shows: camera plus radio.</i>  <i>For continuous technical video fixation, climbers use gopro cameras.</i> <br><br><h3>  Do mosquitoes fly to the sky? </h3><br>  In the air at a height of 400 meters full of living creatures.  According to climbers, sometimes the spire is simply covered with midge.  It's amazing how she gets here - not otherwise, on the wings of the wind ... There are also larger "smaller brothers". <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/fg/4l/tg/fg4ltgdpllbdqfe4s5iglpqukfq.jpeg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/mq/v6/qf/mqv6qft3kzemsynrlfkya9_gsbo.jpeg" alt="image"><br>  <i>High flying mouse</i> <br><br>  And Lakhta Center simply attracts pilots' pilots.  In flight, they are far from always aware that they can prevent people working on the facade and put them at unnecessary risk.  The exception is the official shooting with climbers - and people are ready, and the shots are fantastic. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/pu/ve/sz/puveszuhosyqleqmz-n1_xknot8.jpeg" alt="image"><br><br>  *** <br><h3>  How to get to the spire </h3><br>  What you need to get on the skyscraper spire?  Of course, do not be afraid of heights.  Secondly, to undergo serious training and constantly improve their qualifications. <br><blockquote>  Ilya Pichuzhkin, Head of Ilros Montag Company: <br>  - I know that you can buy a crust of an industrial climber.  But we have this strictly.  Athlete you or not, go to study.  We periodically go through internships - the last one was in February.  The whole team rented a training ground, invited instructors, and everyone worked, including rescue work.  This, by the way, is required by European standards IRATA - the international cable access association. </blockquote>  Several photos from the February internship: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/fl/ml/vv/flmlvvcj51cz-uwtyp_mv3wephm.jpeg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/dk/vv/zo/dkvvzocoahyiaml5jyzvgjcp9z0.jpeg" alt="image"><br><br>  Working out rescue actions: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/m5/pv/ds/m5pvds7_4asgfre9amlgllv15dk.jpeg" alt="image"><br><br>  <i>The first who will come to the rescue at the height - a partner.</i>  <i>When work is at risk, and you are responsible for the life of the person hanging, it is not enough to know what to do.</i>  <i>It is necessary to work everything out in practice, so that in a difficult moment not to indulge in memories of the theory of first aid, but to act immediately - clearly, correctly, without getting lost</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/yj/vf/ro/yjvfrodmlaovs5ofqlz3xstq-sw.jpeg" alt="image"><br><br><h3>  Assembler - today, electrician - tomorrow, climber - always </h3><br>  The main trick with promalpi is that mountaineering itself is only a way to be on the job site.  Therefore, all have a bunch of additional specialties.  For example, in order to mount the barrier lights on the Lahta Center spire, you need to be an electrician.  And the climbers became electricians.  This is a much more realistic approach than getting an ordinary electrician in the Fasadee, teaching him the basics of mountaineering. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/o-/h8/qj/o-h8qjct5jscow012lroi-zhsji.jpeg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/6q/_8/0r/6q_80r990n_v1xja4lwfhnxobzq.jpeg" alt="image"><br>  <i>Work on the installation and adjustment of signal lights on the steeple of the tower Lakhta Center</i> <br><br>  Since there is no constant recipe for work in skyscrapers - every ultra-high one is unique, you need to have a certain ingenuity and engineering vision.  For example, the very first question faced by installers at the towers of Lakhta Center: what to do with 360 meters of free ropes, because they are mounted at level 87 and go down to the ground.  To prevent the ropes from being carried by the wind, they had to be fixed on the facade, and so that it was not only safe, but also convenient.  It wasn‚Äôt possible to achieve this right away, and the installer‚Äôs journey to the place of work took 3-4 hours, as the climber had to run across every five floors - in the places where the ropes were attached.  As a result, a simple fixture with a bracket with a corner and a carabiner holding the rope was developed. <br><blockquote>  Alexander Lugovoi, work manager from Almaz Group: <br>  - The project in reality, as a rule, differs from what is on paper.  All you need to refine on the spot, including in production.  We, for example, participated in assembling the rail of SOF at the factory and found on the ground a few less feasible when working at height of assembly manipulations. </blockquote><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/vf/4n/0v/vf4n0va54slu0fxmlajt7pwncxi.jpeg" alt="image"><br><br>  Very different people come to industrial climbers.  Among them are techies and humanities.  Someone likes to spend holidays in the country, and someone goes to the mountains for new difficult routes.  Combines one: <br><blockquote>  Sergey Belousov, Almaz Group: <br>  - We are all different and appreciate the differences between each other.  But for everyone industrial mountaineering is an opportunity to combine work with the feeling of freedom that gives height. </blockquote><br>  This feeling is exactly freedom, not risk or adrenaline euphoria.  A competent industrial climber will never allow himself to risk his life or his partner.  In a professional environment, there is an admonition that a climber who has ceased to be afraid must be fired immediately. <br><blockquote>  Ilya Pichuzhkin, Ilros Montazh: <br>  - How many worked as a climber, the feeling of excitement, when you step over the edge out, was always. <br></blockquote><blockquote>  Alexander Lugovoy, Almaz Group: <br>  And one more feeling - pride in what I do.  This is not pathos, just our profession, objectively, not everyone can get <br></blockquote><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/k-/b5/8r/k-b58r_pi-yj-4_b6sbn3h7lzs4.jpeg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/v6/ho/mb/v6homb7hxkut71lthtbwjgrxiiy.jpeg" alt="image"><br>  <i>Sergey Kolpakov, industrial climber "Ilros Montazh", with a memorable album "New Height".</i>  <i>On the cover photo of Sergey on the steeple of the tower of Lakhta Center</i> <br><br>  PS <br><br><h3>  Adjustable spidermen </h3><br>  All climbers working on the tower Lakhta Center, is dedicated. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7oD9npK4nB4" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  *** <br>  We thank for the help in preparing the material of industrial climbers - Ilya Pichuzhkin, Sergey Kolpakov (‚ÄúIlros Montazh‚Äù), Sergey Belousov, Alexander Lugovoy (‚ÄúAlmaz Group‚Äù), the project manager of the TetraStroy company Ildar Nasypyov and the head of the section Yegor Lapin - also from ‚Äú TetraStroy ", as well as - Alexander Lucina - Head of the Facades and FPM of the Tower Building and Maxim Gerliman, Chief Specialist of the Department of Occupational Safety and Fire Safety at the IFC Lakhta Center </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/457552/">https://habr.com/ru/post/457552/</a></p>
