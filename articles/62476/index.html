      Now everyone, even a novice musician, can lay out his tracks and begins to earn reward points that he gets from the audience. <br><br>  We made several different ratings that allow us to subject each track to a comprehensive analysis (said, adjusting points), for example, to see the number of auditions, see the assessment of the hall, we even have a jury of several professional musicians who can express their own opinions.  Also, according to a secret formula, we calculate such a vital thing as the popularity of the artist. <br><br>  We tried to make the navigation as varied as possible: for example, you can view artists by genre, by country, and of course, write entries by any letter. <br><br>  Of course, we have a general <a href="http://www.musicdepo.ru/top-10.html">rating of</a> artists, consisting of one hundred positions, sorted by an unbiased opinion of the audience and a biased opinion (joke!) Of the jury. <br><br>  Also, you can write your own news that will appear on the main page, even more drawing attention to their creativity. <br><br>  And, yes, you will not believe what we are going to do.  Each artist will be able to buy a small promo for honestly earned reward points here, on the museum, as a line in the catalog of artists by genre, as well as a couple of other services, such as sending your data and tracks to special agencies around the world, which we carefully compiled.  Of course, this is like a dream: you simply upload your tracks, which you may have forgotten 5 years ago, enjoy the reaction of the audience, and having gained popularity and reward points, spend them on the very only chance that we have prepared for you .  Simply put - we figured out how to turn virtual popularity into real, acting as a producer for you. <br><br>  It makes no sense to say that everything went for a long time to this - artists earn less and less, coming to the Internet, independently organizing VKontakte groups and earning just as much as they are talented. <br><br>  Today, more than a thousand <a href="http://www.musicdepo.ru/artists/">artists</a> <a href="http://www.musicdepo.ru/">have</a> registered for <a href="http://www.musicdepo.ru/">MuzDepo</a> , and the number of <a href="http://www.musicdepo.ru/listeners/">listeners is</a> close to five hundred, which makes us very happy: it means that we did a really useful thing. <br><br>  We were pleasantly surprised to meet some well-known tracks.  Remember, Coca-Cola, "Holiday comes to you"?  So <a href="http://www.musicdepo.ru/users/Canty">that same girl</a> with the most wonderful voice. <br><br>  Are you asking what are the plans? <br>  I will list them in the list so that you, dear community, will be more comfortable to read. <br><br><ul><li>  Replenishment of the prize account using sms (for example, for promotion) </li><li>  Conclusion of reward points, conversion into rubles </li><li>  A more complete set of services for the "promotion" of artists for reward points </li><li>  Live broadcasting from music clubs and venues (here with <a href="http://www.delesalle.ru/muskulls.html">this</a> kit, carefully, flash) </li><li>  Fans will be able to give artists virtual gifts or directly transfer reward points to artists </li><li>  In the online store you can buy real products for reward points, of course, musical </li><li>  Events of artists associated with the sites, for example, the performance of the group X * nd Hammer in the B2 club </li><li>  Vkontakte own application </li><li>  Well, little things like RSS feeds, web radio, karaoke player </li></ul><br>  For those who look at the littered horizon: yes, the layout of the opera flies a little, and also we are going to eliminate some nasty bugs and inconveniences, we will be very grateful for any help, including publicly. <br><br>  PS Attention, in secret to the whole world! <br>  Try to place the cursor on the logo and do not divert seconds for three =) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/62476/">https://habr.com/ru/post/62476/</a></p>
