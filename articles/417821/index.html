    <h2>  About IB </h2><br><blockquote>  <a href="https://habr.com/company/vasexperts/blog/414937/">‚ÄúInaudible frequencies‚Äù: a firewall blocking ultrasonic cookies has appeared</a> </blockquote><ul><li>  It will be a new application for mobile devices SoniControl, which is able to ‚Äúcatch‚Äù acoustic cookies and block them.  We talk about the principles of the system and here are some basic ways to protect gadgets from ultrasonic interference. </li></ul><blockquote>  <a href="https://habr.com/company/vasexperts/blog/412997/">Hide and seek, or the first botnet, which is not afraid of reboot</a> </blockquote><ul><li>  In April, the Bitdefender team discovered an updated version of the acclaimed IoT botnet Hide and Seek.  Hackers implemented a custom P2P protocol and a number of other features, ‚Äúteaching‚Äù the malware to remain on the device even after it was rebooted.  We tell how the virus works and how to protect against it. </li></ul><blockquote>  <a href="https://vasexperts.ru/blog/bezopasnost/firewall-ili-dpi-instrumenty-zashhity-raznogo-naznacheniya/">Firewall or DPI - protection tools for different purposes</a> </blockquote><ul><li>  The subject of the article is how and how you can restrict access to the network.  Let's talk about the advantages and disadvantages of DPI, and also explain why this system in the provider's network can be more effective than packet filters, proxy servers, or managed switches combined. </li></ul><blockquote>  <a href="https://habr.com/company/vasexperts/blog/353516/">History of Information Security in China: Laws and Regulations</a> </blockquote><ul><li>  In November 2016, the All-China People‚Äôs Assembly <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-11-07/china-passes-cybersecurity-law-despite-strong-foreign-opposition">approved a</a> new cyber security law (here you can read the <a href="https://www.chinalawtranslate.com/cybersecuritylaw/%3Flang%3Den">unofficial translation of the law</a> ), which <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2017/05/31/chinas-new-cybersecurity-law-takes-effect-today.html">came</a> into force in June last year.  This post is about what tools China uses to ensure information security in the country - talking about all sorts of classifications and laws. </li></ul><blockquote>  <a href="https://habr.com/company/vasexperts/blog/354698/">A brief history of information security in China: how to build the Great Chinese firewall</a> </blockquote><ul><li>  Continuation of the material on the history of information security in China.  It is dedicated to content filtering technology - ‚ÄúThe Great Chinese Firewall‚Äù.  Let us dwell on the principles of its work: mechanisms for intercepting DNS and content filtering. </li></ul><br><h2>  Pro network protocols </h2><br><blockquote>  <a href="https://vasexperts.ru/blog/bezopasnost/ipv6-texnologiya-nastoyashhego-ili-budushhego/">IPv6 - present or future technology</a> </blockquote><ul><li>  How did it happen that IPv4 addresses began to dry up?  Why was implementing IPv6 harder than expected?  Should I switch to IPv6 at all?  The material will answer these questions and evaluate the benefits of the new protocol. </li></ul><blockquote>  <a href="https://habr.com/company/vasexperts/blog/414935/">UN special agency publishes IPv6 transition plan - IT community is dissatisfied with it</a> </blockquote><ul><li>  The International Telecommunication Union has developed a draft document for migration from IPv4 to IPv6.  However, engineers, Internet registrars and other members of the IT community did not like the plan due to a number of drawbacks of the proposed model: from potential problems with network security to reducing the service life of the protocol.  In the post - more about the arguments in favor of the inapplicability of the plan and the possible reasons for the slow implementation of IPv6. </li></ul><blockquote>  <a href="https://habr.com/company/vasexperts/blog/358932/">Out of IPv4 - the RIPE recorder gave the last block</a> </blockquote><ul><li>  Free IPv4 addresses have been terminated ‚Äúfor sure now‚Äù since 2011.  This time, the last unallocated block was given by the RIPE registrar.  We understand the situation: how did it happen, what can be done about it and why is IPv6 the only worthy replacement for IPv4. </li></ul><blockquote>  <a href="https://vasexperts.ru/blog/telekom/protokol-ipv6-ot-teorii-k-praktike/">IPv6 protocol - from theory to practice</a> </blockquote><ul><li>  Here we offer to evaluate the experience of implementing IPv6 in companies around the world: how the new protocol is transferred in China, what difficulties they encountered in Yandex, etc. In addition, let us tell you how IPv6 is used in home and production networks and what prevents simply take and implement a new protocol. </li></ul><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/-r/um/ed/-rumedy_7ewthpfoxh6oi8ovsdk.jpeg"><br>  <font color="#A9A9A9"><i>/ Flickr / <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/107803477%40N08/14083233043">BT's BDUK</a> / <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/">CC</a></i></font> <br><br><h2>  About carrier networks </h2><br><blockquote>  <a href="https://habr.com/company/vasexperts/blog/359352/">"Finishing line": 5G networks to be, but not before 2020</a> </blockquote><ul><li>  We are talking about obstacles that do not allow to deploy 5G early: the lack of frequencies, money, fiber, and so on.  Also, let's see what ‚Äúpositions‚Äù are occupied by different countries and companies in the 5G race. </li></ul><blockquote>  <a href="https://habr.com/company/vasexperts/blog/358416/">Battle of Net Neutrality: New Hope</a> </blockquote><ul><li>  Despite the fact that after the abolition of the rules of net neutrality in the US, half a year has already passed, the opponents of this decision are not going to give up.  The article will answer the main question: is there a chance that net neutrality will still stand against the FCC?  We will describe the course of the <a href="https://habr.com/company/vasexperts/blog/351366/">struggle of</a> individual states for maintaining net neutrality on their territory and the successes of concerned citizens, companies and human rights organizations in the battle with the FCC. </li></ul><blockquote>  <a href="https://vasexperts.ru/blog/bezopasnost/ddos-i-5g-tolshhe-truba-bolshe-problem/">DDOS and 5G: thicker "pipe" - more problems</a> </blockquote><ul><li>  For some reason, few people think about the potential threat to 5G networks and IoT devices - DDoS attacks.  In this material we tried to correct it and argued that the introduction of these technologies will require more advanced protection methods than they are now.  We also offered possible solutions to the problem of DDoS attacks for service providers: traffic clearing centers (more expensive) and integrated systems (cheaper). </li></ul><blockquote>  <a href="https://vasexperts.ru/blog/telekom/ekonomiya-na-spichkax-i-neskolko-sposobov-vystrelit-sebe-v-nogu-kriticheskie-oshibki-v-stroitelstve-setej-operatorov-svyazi/">Shot in the leg: critical errors in the construction of networks of telecom operators</a> </blockquote><ul><li>  We offer a look at 6 ways to destroy the network - there will be real cases from life, and the "beliefs" of networkers. </li></ul><blockquote>  <a href="https://vasexperts.ru/blog/telekom/internet-v-derevnyu-stroim-radiorelejnuyu-wi-fi-set/">Internet to the village - we build radio-relay Wi-Fi-network</a> </blockquote><ul><li>  In our blog on Habr√© we have already <a href="https://habr.com/company/vasexperts/blog/344120/">told</a> how IT giants are delivering the Internet to remote areas.  This post is devoted to a more practical topic - ways to implement point-to-point or point-to-multipoint microwave radio for remote locations.  We will share our personal experience - when it is better to choose a cable, and when - a radio bridge, and how in the process you do not accidentally break the law. </li></ul><blockquote>  <a href="https://vasexperts.ru/blog/roskomnadzor/integraciya-setevyx-servisov-skat-dpi-i-lanbilling/">Integration of SCAT DPI and LANBilling network services</a> </blockquote><ul><li>  Here is a practical example of L2 BRAS integration based on SCAT DPI (with connection diagrams).  VAS Experts experts share their experiences. </li></ul><br><h2>  About legislation </h2><br><blockquote>  <a href="https://habr.com/company/vasexperts/blog/414933/">Mesh networks on Wi-Fi: why the Wi-Fi Alliance offered its standard</a> </blockquote><ul><li>  Overview of the new Wi-Fi standard EasyMesh: how the technology works, why it was developed, and to whom it can be useful.  We are also talking about the situation with the ecosystem of mesh-networks in general. </li></ul><blockquote>  <a href="https://vasexperts.ru/blog/skat-dpi/predostavlenie-besplatnogo-wi-fi-soglasno-zakonodatelstvu/">Providing free Wi-Fi according to the law.</a> </blockquote><ul><li>  In this material we explain in simple words how to design and implement a free Wi-Fi network using Hotspot technology, in accordance with the legislation of the Russian Federation.  As an example, we will give a case with the implementation of authorization in Wi-Fi on SCAT DPI in the network of one of our clients. </li></ul><blockquote>  <a href="https://habr.com/company/vasexperts/blog/414931/">"Proof of Transit": IETF proposed a new approach to confirm the path of network packets</a> </blockquote><ul><li>  This approach will make sure that the packet has passed along a given route and has not been replaced or modified.  We are talking about the mechanisms of the Proof of Transit, the proposed methods of ensuring packet security and criticism from the community. </li></ul><blockquote>  <a href="https://vasexperts.ru/blog/roskomnadzor/izmeneniya-metoda-vygruzki-spiskov-ot-roskomnadzora-s-polnogo-spiska-na-delty/">Changes in the method of unloading lists from Roskomnadzor.</a>  <a href="https://vasexperts.ru/blog/roskomnadzor/izmeneniya-metoda-vygruzki-spiskov-ot-roskomnadzora-s-polnogo-spiska-na-delty/">From the full list to the delta</a> </blockquote><ul><li>  The new approach involves not unloading the entire registry, but only the changes made.  The material discusses the advantages of the delta method and other methods that simplify the unloading process.  Share what methods of unloading we use in VAS Experts. </li></ul><br>  <i>PS Our other collections and digests:</i> <i><br><br></i> <ul><li>  <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/vasexperts/blog/338862/">DPI-digest: information security, virtualization and regulation</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/vasexperts/blog/328186/">DPI-digest: IPv6, SD-WAN and more</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/vasexperts/blog/315008/">Digest: traffic analysis, comparison of platforms and manufacturers of DPI-systems</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://habr.com/company/vasexperts/blog/354584/">Personal experience: speeches and webinars of VAS Experts on SCAT, BRAS and SORM-3</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://habr.com/company/vasexperts/blog/353984/">Personal experience: speeches and webinars of VAS Experts on SCAT, CG-NAT and DPI systems</a> </li></ul></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/417821/">https://habr.com/ru/post/417821/</a></p>
