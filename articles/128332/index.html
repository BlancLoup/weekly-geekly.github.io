      <i>April 1, 2008</i> <br>  The source of the first version of the neighbors was uploaded to the server of the site <a href="http://www.i-stroy.ru/">i-stroy.ru, which</a> was friendly to me  Unfortunately, by this time all the domains that I looked after earlier were already taken, so after some deliberation I <i>temporarily</i> called myself esosedi (Œ£sosedi). <br>  Any operations with the site were possible only after registration, it was good to not think of fashionable invites at that time. <br>  Attendance 300-500 hosts per day.  Predicted limit (based on niche analysis) - 5k. <br><br>  <i>Summer 2009.</i> <br>  Sometimes in the city I see active advertising aroundme.ru. <br>  Something gnaws at me and makes me work harder. <br><br>  <i>August 29, 2008.</i> <br>  I decided to <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/startup/38405/">otrelizit</a> neighbors on Habr√©.  Only then I realized that Œ£ reads like sigma, and in general the designer of me is not so hot. <br>  Attendance 5k per day.  The predicted limit is no more than 15k. <br>  Soon youterra, telnews, several investors contact me. <br>  I gave the first the source code and the basis for their version of the development of the situation, I give the second one an interview for which, and in a couple of years I am ashamed.  I do not understand why investors are needed. <br><br>  <b><i>September 13, 2008.</i></b> <br>  I am on vacation in Sochi with my wife and child.  For the first time in several years. <br>  Suddenly a strange network activity begins. <br>  Articles from habr and telnews are replicated on the Internet. <br>  This, apparently, and gave a critical mass. <br>  Site attendance 25k. <br>  Sometimes, coming from the sea, we watched TV, heard about some kind of crisis. <br>  It's time to go home.  The bank that served the salary card no longer exists. <br>  I have a wife in my arms, a fifteen-month-old son, 5k and a car with two punched wheels. <br>  Three years have passed since then. <br><br>  Since then, I have not been lucky, wherever I could climb all alone cards. <br><br>  <i>October 2008.</i> <br>  Passing quests in the FSB and the management of K-they do not like secret objects on the map.  Thanks to the work - we did not just VoIP, but VoIP for the FSB. <br><br>  <i>December 2008</i> <br>  the office is bursting at the seams. <br>  I remove the registration requirement from the neighbors, replacing the captcha for the guests. <br>  I begin to notice that I program the web for most of the day, and not the main work. <br>  As a result, for the new year, I turn to work for the wonderful guys from <a href="http://wikimapia.org/">Wikimapia</a> . <br><br>  <i>May 2009</i> <br>  Finally, hands reach to tie the Yandex cards to the neighbors. <br>  I transfer the rights to manage the domain of unprofitable neighbors to the server host where they are located. <br>  The first redesign of the neighbors. <br>  We are hiring a former manager ( <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/integra/" class="user_link">integra</a> ) by that time you‚Äôre already closed, but what she wanted to do then I‚Äôm starting to do just now.  And then, did not grow together. <br><br>  <i>July 2009</i> <br>  Immediately after the rendering of the Wikimapia tile render, I turn to <a href="http://gdeetotdom.ru/">GdeEtotDom.ru</a> <br>  Excellent company, only there for the first time in 15 years of my programming life I learned teamwork and began to reveal the secrets of our industry. <br>  Attendance of neighbors 40k, no one understands why they are needed, but I continue to do something, it is no longer a habit, but a way of life. <br>  After a little thought, captcha with operations performed by guests. <br>  This raises the activity on the site almost 10 times. <br>  Behind the calm watches a crowd of robots <br><br>  <i>December 2009.</i> <br>  On GDD GoogleMaps v3 is advertised.  I was instructed to remake the cards. <br>  With the hope of ever making a backport, I make the neighbors engine refactor and get those maps that are now available at the <a href="http://gdeetotdom.ru/map/">home office</a> . <br>  <i>I should say my desire never came true, although I started rewriting the system for myself about a year ago and it is already <a href="http://tili-testo.ru/">ready</a> for a <a href="http://tili-testo.ru/">long time</a> , and relatively many sites already work on this system, besides who it was originally intended for.</i> <br>  Looking through somehow the logs of the end of robots are protected from spam, I am terrified by the number of rebounds and translate them into deferred triggering (analysis of the time for sending comments, shingles, detection of robots via accessors) <br>  This gives an additional + 10% to activity. <br><br>  <i>2010</i> <br>  The second redesign, attendance at the beginning of the year 50k people and is slowly growing. <br>  All year busy with the birth of the second son, the main work, work on new cards. <br>  For the sake of consistency, all users are moved to subdomains of esosed.ru (for example, <a href="http://kashey.esosed.ru/">kashey.esosed.ru</a> ) <br>  At some point, something magical happened and the income from YAN jumped 10 times (if you count from the plinth). <br>  This allowed to update the server park and develop further. <br><br>  <i>December 2010.</i> <br>  I leave GedEtotDom and turn to another company, and again the card :) <br><br>  <i>spring of 2011</i> <br>  After partial refactoring of client scripts and optimized reaction times, attendance began to grow slightly faster. <br>  The main core of the system does not give in to refactoring and remains what it has been all this time. <br><br>  <i>June 2011.</i> <br>  Yandex.Metrica recorded 98 thousand visitors per day. <br>  Exactly in the middle of my vacation, the security system captures the intruder‚Äôs penetration of the server. <br>  Unknown was installed viral js code on two main sites. <br>  From the roof of the house in the country (there is no Internet below) I somehow find the way of penetration and <i>close it</i> . <br><br>  <i>July 2011.</i> <br>  We transfer the server to hetzner. <br>  Due to the wrong choice of the glusterFS version, we have been experiencing strange server failures for several weeks. <br>  Unstable work leads to a drop in attendance. <br>  Having sneezed on the admin, I figure it out myself, exactly on the day when the GlusterFS update comes out, indicating that our problem was fixed <br><br>  <i>August 2011</i> <br>  In the middle of the day the wife calls and says that Kaspersky is swearing at the site. <br>  And he continued to swear for almost three weeks, while I fought with an unknown, but undoubtedly, talented hacker. <br>  I had to shovel 60 megabytes of sources that had accumulated on the server over the many years of its existence. <br>  Disable various commands (for example, touch, which can change the mtime file, and look for changes), hang guard on nodejs, which monitors changes in FS and even add a second authorization for administrator accounts. <br>  Well, physically isolate all scripts that I don‚Äôt trust (for example, a forum for invision) <br>  <i>(This is the price to pay if half of the scripts were written 5 years ago, and the admin is lazy, and we also want to sleep ourselves)</i> <br><br>  <b><i>September 2011.</i></b> <br>  On the approach is another refactor, which will finally remove the binding from prototype.js and transfer the cards to the new system. <br>  Attendance 70k. <br>  After a couple of days, I am again going on vacation and again in Sochi. <br>  The circle will end. <br><br>  <b>Update</b> <br>  September 18, 2011.  Sochi. <br>  Yesterday we sat on the ‚ÄúBossa Cottage‚Äù and celebrated 7 years from the date of the wedding. <br>  Came sms - sites are not available. <br>  The server has dropped the network card. <br>  During the restoration work, someone didn‚Äôt very carefully rebuild the server and his innoDB crashed. <br>  <i>All as I waited</i> <br><br>  Only three years since the launch, but in these three years you can put half of the life that I remember. <br>  For three years I, from C programmer, turned first into almost pure php, and then into a completely pure js programmer. <br>  He managed to get a certificate from googleMaps (a piece of paper and a T-shirt, currently the program is closed), and get a Chihuahua, in addition to two cats and two boys. <br><br>  Despite the fact that the neighbors already bring more than the main work, they still remain my hobby, which is given a maximum of two hours a day, as long as I travel by train to work. <br>  Unfortunately, despite several of my attempts to attract at least one more programmer (or, a dream, a designer), I still work alone. <br><br>  Over the years, it is clear that the original model was differently chosen from other projects and, as a result, the neighbors are now a cartographic talker, and not a cartographic system. <br><br>  Now neighbors is <br>  15 thousand registered <s>neighbors</s> people, because registration is <s>terrible is</s> not required <br>  20 thousand tweets <br>  250 thousand comments left to various places <br>  400 thousand different places and 350 thousand reference objects <br>  and 700 thousand edits of these places and objects. <br><br>  And thanks to Habra for teaching me how to do all this, and to Yandex, who made it all possible. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/128332/">https://habr.com/ru/post/128332/</a></p>
