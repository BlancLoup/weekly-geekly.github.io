In a smaller business, these rules do not work.  There, as a rule, everyone does everything. <br><br>  Of course, I think that you chose the ERP system correctly, and did not point your finger at the sky (I wrote how to do this <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/erp_systems/91996/">here</a> , <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/erp_systems/92235/">here</a> , <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/erp_systems/93448/">here</a> and <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/erp_systems/94352/">here</a> ).  Of course, you are not trying to automate chaos, but you have distinct business processes or you use those that are incorporated in the ERP system.  These things are not even discussed here. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h5>  Everyone is responsible for their data and he enters them </h5><br>  There should not be a situation when in reality one employee generates some information, and another enters this data into the system.  This just should not be.

      Once I observed a company in which managers were too lazy to enter accounts into their clients.  It was for them that their assistants did.  And it turned into madness.  The manager, at best by email, and at worst on the fly, informed the assistant that such and such a client needed to issue an invoice for such and such goods.  But the problem is that the manager believes that this client and this product are called in a certain way, and in the system it is listed a little differently.  As a result, the assistant after several hours of proceedings writes out the same invoice.  But to the wrong customer and the wrong product.  Just because the database has several similar names and customers and products, but the manager did not specify.  The client calls the manager, the manager calls the assistant, he corrects, but again the inaccuracy.  The invoice takes 5 calls and half a day of work of several people.  I asked the head of the company why he would not stop this vicious practice.  He received the answer: ‚Äúmanagers are very busy people and they have no time to write invoices themselves‚Äù.  I think any reasonable person will understand that this is nonsense.  The manager himself will write out a bill in 5 minutes and everything will be right there.  And the client will not be nervous, and no one will lose time. <br><br>  Coming and writing off goods from the warehouse should be only one person.  Storekeeper.  Sam, do it yourself.  If the goods to the warehouse are received (written off) by someone else, I guarantee you that, sooner or later, you will get a problem when the goods left by the program show and the real balances simply do not converge.  100% guaranteed.  If you feel sorry for the money on the storekeeper, you are not implementing ERP. <br><br>  To accept, write off money from the cashier should the cashier and no one else.  That is, the one who sits and takes this money in real life.  Otherwise, get the problem, as with the stockman. <br><br>  It is better not to deposit money in the bank at all with your hands, but to import a bank statement from a client-bank.  One inadvertently entered extra zero and your remnants "float."  If you do not have a client bank, then I have no words. <br><br><h5>  Clear separation of chains </h5><br>  The purchasing manager should never enter customer invoices.  This should be done by sales managers.  Moreover, the purchasing manager should not even communicate with customers.  The client should have one person in your company who deals with his problems.  This is a sales manager.  The seller, in other words.  If your sales managers connect customers with purchasers to let them know when the goods will arrive, then either your ERP is not exactly ERP (because you cannot see it in it), or you need to solve the problem in management and force the sellers to look at this information yourself . <br><br>  Everyone should be responsible for their site.  The sales manager must work with customers and enter relevant information into the system.  The purchasing manager should work with suppliers and enter relevant information. <br><br>  The storekeeper must come / write off goods from the warehouse, the cashier accepts / issues money, the accountant imports the bank, etc. <br><br>  There should not be such that someone comes up to someone and asks him to enter some information into the ERP.  This should never happen!  Everyone enters information.  Otherwise, you will get a problem when someone brought it, but not so.  And then it begins: ‚ÄúI asked you to bring this here, and you brought it in the wrong place.  I told you wrong, etc. ‚Äù <br><br><h5>  Inquiry Office </h5><br>  No one should work as an information desk.  ERP-system is the tool that should save the company from it.  Every employee should know where and what information he can see.  Every employee is annoyed when everyone calls him and asks for the same thing.  When will the goods arrive?  Pay us the bill?  Have you agreed a contract?  Etc.  All such information should all receive their own.  If you do not know how to get it, you can call and ask where to look at it.  If your ERP system does not allow you to get rid of the "help desk", you made a mistake and chose the wrong ERP system. <br><br>  When your employees work for each other's help desk, the whole company suffers.  Labor productivity is declining, which means the company is losing money. <br><br><h5>  The law is one for all </h5><br>  There should not be situations where everyone should work according to certain principles, but there are employees for whom exceptions are made.  For example, if in order to receive money, you need to fill out an application, then everyone should do it.  Even the CEO.  The storekeeper should not give the goods to the executive director without an electronic application, because "well, he's executive." <br><br>  All these problems should be solved by the head of the enterprise.  Employees who do not want to work according to the rules need to either reason or dismiss. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/100414/">https://habr.com/ru/post/100414/</a></p>
