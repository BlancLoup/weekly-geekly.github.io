  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Copter Shot</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  According to statistics and analytics, from 2014 to 2017 the number of drones in the commercial and amateur field increased by 3 times.  And these drones sometimes fly in the wrong place.  Such a situation with flights could not be ignored and the lawmakers almost banned (could make it almost impossible) UAV flights of up to 30 kg in the territory of the Russian Federation.  Fortunately, they came to their senses in time and anyone can take pictures of beautiful shots from a bird's eye view almost at any point.  But what to do when someone‚Äôs drone is approaching a closed area where the strategic secrets of our country are kept?  For each task there is a weapon and for the "landing" of drones safe and sound now such a weapon also exists. <br><br>  <i>Read to the end of the bonus - a demonstration of "shooting" a gun.</i> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/65d/e56/497/65de56497cb6425c8db3bb5bbf24fd5f.png"><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The picture shows a valid copy in a reduced state.  In fact, the gun against drones looks like this: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f76/7cb/3b0/f767cb3b06794906ae7e2f6319abbefe.jpg"><br><br>  It is quite obvious that the weapons produced by Hikvision.  But it is known on the market primarily for excellent video surveillance systems.  Founded in 2001, the company has grown from 28 to 17,000 employees in such a short time.  Moreover, the staff has more than 7,000 engineers who are engaged in R &amp; D or scientific research.  It is possible that this weapon was developed in the fight against competitors' drones, who looked into the windows of the Hikvision engineers, but this is not a proven fact.  And the fact is that this gun works.

      Let's go back to the statistics. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/9e3/c2b/fdb/9e3c2bfdb8794234adaef2d5adc2d794.jpg"><br><br>  Judging by the forecast of analysts, we are expected to increasingly fill the flight zone with various types of unmanned aerial vehicles.  And although the military budget for UAVs changes very slowly (based on US statistics), the commercial and civilian use of drones will continue to evolve. <br><br>  And this is not so much about the protection of private territory, when some citizens do not want to make public the <s>area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe storage</s> facilities and the location of the objects in the territory, but rather about restricting flights over a particular zone. <br><br>  From the above, there are only two ways out: the physical destruction of the drone or the disabling of the drone control systems with its immediate landing or expulsion from the protected territory. <br><br>  Then it's time to talk about the possibilities and principles of the gun.  And the principle of operation is simple and effective: break the connection with the control unit and drown out the satellite navigation signal. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/76b/be7/06a/76bbe706a9f74dd6a0da407ef1798162.JPG"><br><br>  The gun suppresses three bands at once: GNSS (GPS / GLONASS / Galileo L1 / BeiDou B1), 2.4G, 5.8G.  Confident defeat distance reaches 1200 meters.  Power consumption in active mode - up to 100 watts.  Signal power at frequencies: 39.5dBm (1.5 GHz) 50.5dBm (2.4 GHz) 48.5dBm (5.8 GHz).  The question arises: what will happen to the navigator of the aircraft if it gets into the sight of such a gun?  And there will be nothing: the civilian L1 band operates at a frequency of 1575.42 MHz, and the planes receive a navigation signal from satellites at a frequency of L2 of 1227.6 MHz.  The antenna's directivity angle is 29 degrees diagonally and 25 degrees vertically, so you should not aim very carefully. <br><br>  How it works? <br><br>  If you just need to drive off the drone, then it is enough to silence the signal from the operator‚Äôs console.  Almost all drones are able to return to the starting point on the GPS coordinates with the loss of communication with the remote control. <br><br>  If it is necessary to force the drone to be forced, then it is necessary to jam not only the signal from the console, but also the satellite navigation signal.  With the loss of all types of communication, drones are programmed to land.  In this case, the UAV will remain on foreign territory if the operator has decided to fly over a closed object. <br><br>  Now consider what the whole system consists of. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/697/758/0d0/6977580d09b8408a8d1b83d79dea0401.JPG"><br><br><ol><li>  Power Adapter Connector </li><li>  Control block </li><li>  Battery </li><li>  Radiating antenna </li><li>  Trigger - activator of the radio emitter </li><li>  Adjustable butt </li><li>  Indicators: battery charge / status, active mode, radiation mode;  frequency power controllers </li><li>  9x optical scope </li></ol><br>  Please note that the rifle mounted two Pikatini trims, which means that you can change the sight or add a body kit.  And although the angle of the gun is quite wide, the 9-fold sight will not be superfluous, especially with a shooting distance of a kilometer or more. <br><br>  Now it remains to understand how much this structure weighs and how long it can work autonomously.  To do this, refer to the specification.  So, the manufacturer promises at least 10 hours in standby mode and at least 1.5 hours in shooting mode - and this is a very good result, taking into account the output power.  But you have to pay for everything.  The weight of the gun is 3 kg, the control unit - 3.5 kg and the battery 0.9 kg. <br><br>  Dimensions of the control unit: 315 x 230 x 96.5 mm <br>  Gun dimensions: 871 x 341.6 x 148.1 mm <br>  Operating temperature range: -20 to +55 <br><br>  But Hikvision has achieved success not only in the fight against the UAV, but also developed its own drones.  In addition, developments are underway in robotics and the automation of familiar and seemingly inconspicuous procedures, for example, in parking a car.  If you are interested in these topics, then leave the questions in the comments, and I will definitely tell about this in the subsequent materials. <br>  In the meantime, I propose to look at the gun in action. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mIyY4P1EeFc" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/403271/">https://habr.com/ru/post/403271/</a></p>
