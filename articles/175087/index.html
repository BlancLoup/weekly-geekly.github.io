  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Why MineCraft is worth using in education</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  I read the article <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/165863/">that Minecraft lessons were introduced in Sweden</a> and thought, but in this, there is something!  This game stands out against the background of its teaching ability. <br>  I decided to write an article on why Minecraft should be used as a learning platform for children, with an example of how it was useful to me, that he made me learn and try to argue why I should show this game to a child, and it‚Äôs better to start playing with it on one server.  At the same time, I will describe the features of the game for those who know about Minecraft, "just that everything is square there." <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/24b/4a1/a3d/24b4a1a3db937ab7254575f70922a103.jpg" alt="image"><br><a name="habracut"></a>  I'll start from the beginning and classic Minecraft: the scaring threshold for novice players is high.  To survive the first night of the game you actually need to read the guide and learn 5+ recipes.  You rarely see this in games.  But this is easily compensated by the next sitting parent, who will tell and show everything, at the same time and get points of respect in the form of ‚Äúand my father knows what difficult things he knows.‚Äù  Further, the child will in fact learn to survive, even in a virtually uninhabited world, he will understand that things are made of something, and other things of those that have already been made.  He will learn how to plan (it‚Äôs necessary to stock up on food in advance, if you haven‚Äôt saved him from stress by setting a peace-loving level of difficulty).  Memory will be trained and logical chains of the ‚Äútree of production of objects‚Äù will be built.  On this, in principle, it would be possible to finish the useful effects of the game, but for a long time there is a huge number of mods for real life projections, and you should personally talk about the most popular and proven ones. <br><br>  <b>BuildCraft and IndustrialCraft2</b> <br><br>  As the name implies fashion adds to the game industry.  These are various engines and mechanisms, electricity and its consumers.  Personally, these modes forced me to remember the materiel of electricity.  After a couple of exploded due to improper connection of devices, I realized that the voltage should be approached more seriously in the game.  Just remember about the resistance and such a thing as insulation of wires.  At first, the devices are assembled in the mod, and the first sources of electricity for them are received.  Then there is the study of those things that can be made from the products of these devices and how to use electricity.  On the jet pack, many are sure that they will not refuse to fly, it is he who forces them to learn a large production chain.  After the euphoria of free flight and the fact that you yourself collected IT (not too hard, but not too easy), you will want a quantum (if the child plays online).  And here comes the understanding that it is necessary to do a nuclear reactor (!) Because for a quantum Iridium is needed, which can only be obtained from matter, and for its production you need a huge amount of energy.  And it‚Äôs okay to assemble a nuclear reactor, we still need to plan it properly, so that it does not jerk and give the necessary amount of energy.  Usually, the more energy, the less the reactor can operate without cooling, but this is a matter of the reactor circuit and the number of resources invested in it. <br>  So we got a quantum armor that makes us fast, almost invulnerable (you can swim in the lava), not experiencing hunger and giving the opportunity to breathe underwater.  Personally, I would, if I started playing like this in my childhood, I would immediately become interested in science, and not years later!

      <b>Forestry</b> <br><br>  This mod adds mechanisms to simplify the extraction and processing of various organic components.  Almost all instruments need the power of engines from BuildCraft.  It seems the same industrial, with a bunch of new devices having built which you can simplify your life, and what will it teach then?  Do not believe it, but because of him I teach that the biology teacher at school and the teacher at the institute, and specifically the fundamentals of genetics, the laws of Mendel, could not force me to learn.  This mod adds more beekeeping.  Bee products are used in simple crafts, and you can not go into the wilds of genetics, but if you do the selection and the correct crossing, you can get bees with different characteristics.  The most interesting is that which gives experience if you stand with a hive where the Paradise Bees work.  After entering the opportunity to enchant the book, it became possible to obtain delicious effects, but it is necessary to spend a huge amount of experience.  But in order to get heavenly bees, you need to withdraw and cross 3 different branches.  On my server, one player brought them out and sells the opportunity to stand in the "rays of endless experience" "not for cheap." <br><br>  <b>Total</b> <br><br>  All of the above child can easily master, the main thing would be motivation.  This is the way the human psychology works, that there is more motivation in games than in ‚Äúyou have to learn so that you have a future‚Äù.  Children will be hacked into computer games, the only question is how much benefit from counteraction or football on a joystick?  Let them develop creativity, logic, planning and memory.  The world is changing and teaching methods should also.  I think it is worth taking a step into the future and start showing the child the right toys that at least give him something. <br><br>  <b>Update: The</b> article is not a call to make children play computer games, but rather to pay attention to the fact that some of the attention of the current generation has gone into computers and it is necessary to compensate for this with a more thoughtful approach to what the child is playing. <br>  <b>Update2:</b> to complete the picture of the possibilities of creativity in minecraft, add this <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/143363/">link.</a>  ATP for her <a href="https://megamozg.ru/users/s1im/" class="user_link">s1im</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/175087/">https://habr.com/ru/post/175087/</a></p>
