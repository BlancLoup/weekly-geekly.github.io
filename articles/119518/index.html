It's just not very pleasant when you think that you are dealing with a solid company, but instead you run into another fertilizer. <br><br>  The situation is painfully simple and at the same time probably unexpected for the average man in the street.  I have a mailbox on Yandex, which I have been using for eight years now, and a wallet that I have not used, tied to the specified mailbox.  In my billing information I have a verified cell phone number.  So, I did not use Yandex.Money <i>(I specify, the wallet existed, but was not used, I kept the amount of 99 kopecks)</i> until last week, until I was aground and I did not think of anything, how to borrow 600 rubles from a friend who had the means only on the account sabzh.  I saw the money on the account, the same moment, but when it was soon necessary to pay for mobile communication, I was faced with the notice ‚ÄúOperation is prohibited, contact the support service!‚Äù <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The support service informed me that:

To do this, do the following: <br><br>  1. Fill out the form attached to this letter, indicating additional information on this account - any information confirming the management of this account, for example, how money was credited to the account, or another. <br>  2. If you are in Moscow or St. Petersburg, you can bring the completed application in person to the Yandex.Money system representative office.  Addresses of representative offices are listed on our website: <a href="">money.yandex.ru/doc.xml?id=157622</a> <br>  You must have a passport or military ID with you. <br>  3. If you are unable to come in person, you need to notarize your signature on the application and send us this application by registered mail to: <br>  119021, Moscow, POB 57, OOO PS Yandex.Money. <br>  In this case, note that the notary, certifying the authenticity of the signature on the document, does not certify the facts stated in it, but only confirms that the signature was made by a certain person (see Art. 80 of the Fundamentals of the Russian Federation Law on Notary). <br><br>  Important information: <br>  - The application should be sent by mail only to the mailbox, and by express mail and courier delivery - to the address of the Moscow office. <br>  - <b>Applications without notarization of</b> signature, sent by mail or courier delivery, are <b>not considered</b> . <br>  - Applications from minors are accepted only in the presence of parents or in the provision of their notarized written consent to use the system. <br>  - The term of consideration of the application is <b>20 working days</b> from the date of its receipt. <br><br>  Your application will be reviewed and, <b>if technically possible</b> , satisfied.  If the result is positive, your account will be identified if it has not been identified before.  The identification will need to be confirmed on the Yandex.Money website or via the Internet.Wallet program, if you use it. </blockquote><br><br><blockquote>  As we have already explained, in accordance with clause 4.6.2.5 subparagraph 3 of the Agreement on the use of the Yandex.Money payment system, the system operator has the right to: <br><br>  4.6.2.5.  To prohibit the User any actions related to the management and use of the Virtual Account until the User provides clarifications on the form established by the System Operator and reviews them in accordance with clause 10.3 in the following cases: <br>  3).  the emergence of the System Operator, at its discretion, of the need to identify the User. <br><br>  Accordingly, our Security Service reserves the right (at its discretion) to ask for identification or clarification about the use of the account of any user. <br>  You have accepted the terms of the Agreement upon registration by checking the ‚ÄúAgree‚Äù box. </blockquote><br><br><blockquote><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/b5b/95b/d73/b5b95bd73c5d4128c8794a00f764c431.jpg" alt="image" align="right"><br>  Please note: <br>  1. Expenditures are suspended temporarily, until a positive decision on your application.  At the same time, all your money - both credited earlier and incoming now - is saved on your account. <br>  2. The decision to suspend spending transactions is a necessary measure, due to the fact <b>that the circumstances of using your account differ from the standard ones.</b>  <i>(aha, I finally got money there, as much as 600 rubles a pancake)</i> .  This does not mean that you are accused of something, but we need to get comments from you.  Unfortunately, according to the requirements of security and confidentiality, we do not have the right to discuss this issue by e-mail or by phone.  Hope for your understanding. <br></blockquote><br><br>  And the phrase is clearly from a person, not from a robot: <br><blockquote>  To restore access you need to act as we recommended in previous letters. <br><br>  Unfortunately, there are no other options. </blockquote><br><br>  As a result, in order to get access to my 600 rubles (now hostage to Yandex), I need to spend a comparable or large amount and wait up to one month.  Tremendous efficiency in the age of information technology and electronic payments. <br>  Thank you, dear guys from Yandex, for such a gorgeous pig.  Of course, I myself Sam-Seb-Zlobny-Buratino, but in life there are different situations, when you need to urgently pay for the mobile, but there is no money.  At your service, I promise to discourage your friends from retiring. <br><br>  <b>UPD</b> Question to the lawyers, but is it possible to qualify it as extortion or the imposition of services?  I look here a lot of sufferers ... Can we issue a class action lawsuit?  Incidentally, I am working purely by chance in arbitration. <br><br>  <b>UPD 2</b> Dialogue with Yandex.Money representatives <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/pay_sistem/119518/">habrahabr.ru/blogs/pay_sistem/119518/#comment_3907839</a> Actually there is no dialogue, the guys talk about their corporate principles, like robots, and do not rush my specific client problem. <br><br>  <b>UPD 3</b> Forcing the issue issue in Radio-T <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/pay_sistem/119518/">habrahabr.ru/blogs/pay_sistem/119518/#comment_3909276</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/119518/">https://habr.com/ru/post/119518/</a></p>
