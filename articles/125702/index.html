They do not want to work with rare exceptions, and therefore need strict authoritarian control.  The opinion of the employee by default is considered idiotic and is not taken into account by the leaders.  This reality, by the way, is still preserved in some places. <br><br><h2>  Employees in a creative team - partners </h2><br>  Modern business assumes that you are working in a creative team, where they rule not just stupid repetitive operations, but flexibility, that is, the ability to quickly respond to changing conditions.  There is even the concept of "learnability of the company", that is, the possibility of systemic change along with a change in external conditions.  The faster a company learns - the better it does business, in general.

      Employees in this model want to work.  Yes, yes, they are motivated to achieve business goals that overlap with personal goals.  It is interesting and useful to work: and most of the staff in the company of such a model understands this. <br><br><h2>  What is characteristic of new model companies? </h2><ol><li>  A business leader who does not set the task ‚Äúdo it like this‚Äù, but forms the <b>criteria for the result</b> .  Simply put, an employee has a high degree of discretion in achieving the goal. </li><li>  <b>High information exchange within the team</b> .  Everyone should feel the results of their actions, and therefore all the business of the company is conveyed to the employees. </li><li>  <b>Dispersive management</b> : it is possible that on one task you are in charge of an employee, on the other his voice becomes decisive.  Plus a floating structure: teams are formed for projects, an employee can move from group to group as needed. </li><li>  <b>The opinion of people on the ground is</b> very important: they help to improve the processes from the bottom up, that is, they train the company.  Business leaders introduce a common strategy, but a great deal depends on the implementation at the executive level. </li><li>  <b>Stimulate learning.</b>  The employee is not obliged to know all the subtleties of the processes at the time of entry into the project, but the ability to quickly learn and constantly improve skills is very valuable. </li></ol><br>  We adhere to about this model, but we combine it with a clear regulation of the duties of sellers in stores (a la work algorithms).  This is due to the fact that the further a person is from the core of the company, the more difficult it is to give him the necessary information - and it is replaced with instructions. <br><br><h2>  The most valuable quality employee </h2><br>  Usually at the interviews are assessed the professional qualities of specialists and their compliance with the stated requirements.  However, if your task is not to close one local project, but to create a cohesive team (and the team is one of the most important assets of any company), then you need to choose a little differently, taking into account the perspective. <br><br>  <b>The most valuable quality of an employee is sincere interest in the case.</b>  If a person goes to the office to sit for money, he is absolutely not needed: it is much better to find, perhaps a little less professional, but not indifferent to the result.  The second important quality is the compliance of the team in the spirit.  For example, we communicate fairly informally in the office, we have a constant positive and slightly frantic pace of solving many issues.  I know from experience that not everyone can withstand even the positive atmosphere in itself, as well as 10-15 minute meetings on major issues. <br><br>  Why is it important that a person be in spirit and be interested in business?  Because then he will very quickly understand how to act most correctly and logically in any situation.  For example, there are people who will ask 500 questions before doing - or vice versa, they will immediately rush into battle without specifying, which is no less difficult.  A person who loves his business, keeps in mind the desired result and understands what happens next depending on his actions.  When he needs, he asks when he needs it, immediately he does it with an inner understanding of correctness.  A person who is not aware of such things gradually begins to slow down the workflow. <br><br>  <i><b>UPD</b> .</i>  <i>The comments write about professionalism versus motivation.</i>  <i>Yes, professionalism is very important, but with any choice, motivation is crucial.</i>  <i>I know that many large companies prefer to train specialists from scratch, so as not to encounter the ‚Äúbad legacy‚Äù and outdated working methods.</i> <br><br><h2>  How is the interview? </h2><br><ul><li>  Interview with us, in Mosigre, is conducted with everyone who is more or less similar to satisfying the requirements.  Invite 3 people instead of 10 is tempting, but if you need a good employee, it is better to call everyone. </li><li>  The interview is conducted by the head of the department or a responsible person for a couple with the executive director.  No intermediate staffing specialists. </li><li>  Mandatory quality is positive.  Without this in any way.  Many at first wildly perceive the atmosphere of our interviews, but if the wave is ‚Äúpicked up,‚Äù then everything is fine. </li><li>  A person should not want to please you.  A competent specialist chooses the work himself, and does not try by all means to get it from you. </li></ul><br><h2>  Team motivation </h2><br>  While the company has several people selected by the described criteria, everything is simple: everything is in sight, the head, in fact, one, a special structure is not needed.  Employees see the result of their actions and therefore work effectively.  As the number of people in a team grows, the opportunity to see what has been done decreases.  The farther a person is from the ‚Äúcenter of activity,‚Äù the less productively he works. <br><br>  Accordingly, to maintain motivation, it is first of all important to build a scheme that allows you to keep everyone abreast of the company's activities.  For example, we have weekly general meetings for senior outlets (which then convey information to salespeople on the spot), a corporate blog, where anyone can suggest an idea or contact the director directly on any issue, have general English classes and so on.  Recently, 30 people left for the Invasion to work together - this is a rest, experience and, of course, an important event for us. <br><br>  We try to make the workflow itself motivate people.  I know that one of the most enjoyable activities for management is to stand in stores and trade like ordinary sellers: it‚Äôs very pleasant to ‚Äúlight up‚Äù the good mood of customers, who will certainly give an equally remarkable answer.  By the way, just look at our books with feedback in stores: they are literally filled with thanks to the staff, which also motivates a lot.  The scheme of building such a positive serves to increase customer service and staff motivation. <br><br><h2>  About the main </h2><br>  So that tasks do not ‚Äúhang‚Äù for each is assigned responsible.  This eliminates unnecessary discussions and increases efficiency.  When the military send two soldiers to get water, they still appoint an elder who, in which case, will decide which way to go, how to take water and other issues so that there is no dispute. <br><br><h2>  Silent means consent </h2><br>  When information about a task arrives (for example, by mail), it is considered that if the employee did not answer, he understood everything and works.  While he is silent, the manager knows that everything is ok.  If the task is complex-important or not fully formalized, then the employee answers as follows: <br><ul><li>  What is accepted in the work (this is important). </li><li>  Evaluates the term and asks to set a priority, if necessary. </li><li>  Asks questions and requests resources. </li></ul>  The next exchange of information occurs when there is a deviation from the plan (‚Äúwe‚Äôll do it a day later,‚Äù ‚Äúwe cannot, until Task X of the neighboring department closes‚Äù) or during actual execution. <br><br><h2>  Question of trust </h2><br>  The general policy is that all possibilities of abuse of the position should be excluded.  Here is a very important point: on the one hand, to know that everyone is honest, and on the other - not to create a temptation. <br><br>  A typical example is a corporate discount.  It is equal to the maximum retail, that is, 10% (we never give more discounts to retail because we keep the minimum prices on most of the price list).  A discount could provoke more abuses, for example, characteristic of bartenders (an order for cash at a regular price, breaks through with a discount). <br><br>  Such a policy of selling games to its employees makes it clear the real value of the product and, oddly enough, it is better to sell it.  Of course, this discount is valid for any employee (even if he worked a year ago) and for his friends, to whom he can also sell goods at a discount. <br><br><h2>  Who does not mow - that does not work </h2><br>  Mistakes happen always and at all.  They are divided into two categories: the first is when the performer is a sincere deer (which happens in our reality), and the second is when he conducted the experiment and was mistaken.  In the second case, this is not a mistake, but simply the information received, for which the company paid.  For 10 such errors, there are 1-2 actions that pay back losses at times - and these actions would not have been taken if everyone was cautious.  Another situation is possible when an employee makes a mistake because of you: for example, you didn‚Äôt train him, explain something, etc. <br><br>  For example, if our salesman in the store received a fake bill and did not check - this is his personal material school.  If he could not check due to the lack of equipment, this is a jamb of the territorial head, the employee was completely right in his actions. <br><br><h2>  Pro Awards </h2><br>  In my first company, prizes were awarded upon delivery of a large order.  This was understandable and reasonable, but in no way connected with a personal contribution to the cause.  In the second award were given for "labor feats" and combined with fines.  At the exploits no one went out of caution.  In another place, bonuses were given at the end of the month due to two factors: results of work and availability of money - if you worked well, the bonus may or may not be.  The result was simple - no one understood the mechanics of awarding the prize, and because of that it did not work. <br><br>  Bonuses should be such that you can clearly understand why the employee received a bonus.  If the prize is given at the end of the month, the moment of its ‚Äúconquest‚Äù must be somehow noted, for example, at least in a letter.  Many things can be awarded intangible: for example, travel, some additional features, even letters of thanks. <br><br><h2>  About corporate parties </h2><br>  It is assumed that they unite the team.  Literate - yes, but literate is good if 5%.  The rest unite the team only for the period of drinking alcoholic beverages and, in fact, do not work. <br><br>  One cosmetics company once asked their managers: ‚ÄúInvite a group to speak or give out to everyone on the iPod‚Äù?  Although the staff were not fans of apples, but they loved this group, they still chose the glands.  Hence the simple rule: when organizing a corporate party, always think that you can simply distribute 100 bucks to employees.  If the effects are comparable, then the corporate party you do not need. <br><br><h2>  Do what you want, but spice must flow! </h2><br>  Freedom of realization unleashes hands and makes labor effective.  If you simply set a task and describe when it is needed and how you will check the implementation, believe me, the result will be several times higher than when stated in an authoritarian way.  If you add to this a deep understanding and motivation, the result will be simply magical.  In order for this to work, you need to choose positive and ready-to-learn people - and to support just such a corporate spirit.  Interestingly, a motivated person either works only 1-2 years, or during the same period significantly increases the position in the company. <br><br>  PS I hope my experience helped you.  If I understood how flexible management works, why it is important to communicate almost everything to employees, how to handle jambs and much more at least three years ago, I would save at least a couple of projects from my practice. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/125702/">https://habr.com/ru/post/125702/</a></p>
