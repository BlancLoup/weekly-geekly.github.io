  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Work on elance for beginners. Part 2</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img src="http://sergeychik.ru/images/elance.gif"><br>  So, in the previous part ( <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/arbeit/39870/">How to start working on Elance.com. A quick guide for a web designer.</a> ) We stopped at the bids (applications for the project) <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  Correct bids with examples, getting started </h4><br>  This is perhaps the main part of my story.  How you can make and throw bids will determine the profitability of your work. <br><ul><li>  Immediately introduce yourself as an individual, no need to invent any nonsense and write in the style of "we are a talented young company / web studio that satisfies everyone left and right."  In the bidet you can briefly list the advantages of working with an individual. </li><li>  Do not write generic bids (I have super development experience, I know all the technologies, I will do your project at the highest level).  Laziness is a good thing, but it is here that you need to overcome it. </li><li>  Insert 3-4 links to specific thematic screenshots.  Links to the portfolio are very long so use tinyurl.com </li><li>  Insert a short plan with the stages of work (deadlines and prices) </li><li>  Leave in the text and the price the possibility of maneuver for the customer </li></ul><br>  Examples: <br>  <a href="http://sergeychik.ru/bids/bid1.html">Bad Hindu Bid</a> (used in the same form for any projects) <br>  <a href="http://sergeychik.ru/bids/bid2.html">My bid for the project</a> (I feel that after such a rape, he will still meet me at the elance, which of course I would not want to - add my thoughts to the text :)) <br><br>  This does not mean that nobody bites at generic bids, the matter is still in your level - when you become big and famous, you will manage without bids - the customers will come themselves))) <br><br>  Sometimes customers, in addition to screenshots from a portfolio, may ask you for recommendations from clients or links to work projects (this is of course more for those who have just registered and have no reviews).

      References - reviews from your previous US-based clients, so here customers really check them by email or phone. Therefore, you shouldn‚Äôt write what I did on ibm.com, because you can ask for a phone.  This is quite common practice. <br><br>  If you cannot show a working project and so on to the request of a new customer, then try to say that you signed the NDA (nondisclosure agreement - confidentiality agreements, practiced everywhere) - not a fact that they will believe you, but at least they will be left behind. <br><br>  Total: a competent bid that is clearly suited to solving the problem of efficiency many times greater than generic bids <br><br><h4>  Business terms </h4><br>  After you have been selected by the project executor, it is necessary to coordinate the plan of works and payments.  First, according to this plan, you will receive money (since the process is automated to some extent, it is simply more convenient to send an application for a specific payment, which is already spelled out in your plan). <br><br>  Secondly, this is a very important point when resolving conflict situations with the customer. <br><br><h4>  Project execution, reviews </h4><br>  PMB - private message board - internal message system <br><br>  From the very beginning of execution, keep all correspondence through PMB (at least with new customers).  Be sure to send all work only through it.  Otherwise, in the event of a conflict, do not find the ends. <br>  I took it more lightly, but the last order made me change my mind. <br><br>  I will not describe the implementation of the project - there is already someone in that much, but know that you can always remember your razvdezdystvo in the recall :) <br><br>  Feedback (feedback) is a key thing for your development, it is even more important than a portfolio. <br>  Therefore, always try to carry out the project like this (work in good faith and make small concessions) in order to get a positive feedback from 4 to 5 points. <br>  If something has not grown together during the work, then try to agree - for example, throw off the price, do additional work for a good review. <br><br>  Good advice for beginners - take on small and cheap tasks that others neglect, do them quickly, so as to quickly get the first reviews. <br><br>  Remind the customer after the project, that would be nice to leave a review. <br><br>  In general, do not skimp on the words of gratitude for the customer and the results of the project - ‚Äúexcellent, super‚Äù - we are not particularly accepted, but there - yes.  Leave people a good impression of the work. <br><br>  Total: Honor must be protected from the youth :) to spoil the reputation - very quickly, and to turn out - for a very long time. <br><br><h4>  Financial issues, conflicting prices, payments, withdrawals </h4><br><h5>  Cost of participation for the event </h5><br>  The cost of participation - approximately 250-400r per month (depends on the number of bids, they can be re-purchased) <br>  Payment to Elansu, percentage of the transaction - 10% <br><br>  Payment - by plastic card or from an internal account, there are no problems. <br><br><h5>  Payments, conflicts </h5><br>  Use escrow - the designer is much easier to throw than the programmer (personally, I can not stand pinching the gips and setting up the watermark), so use a secure transaction.  This is generally accepted.  In general, the choice of payment model determines the customer when placing the project, you can only confirm. <br><br>  In the event of a conflict with the customer, we can refer to elance arbitration to resolve the issue.  Arbitrage works only with money deposited into an escrow account. <br><br>  The essence of arbitration is elance trying to act as a regulating party and resolve the issue with the world (to draw up a new work plan, etc.), if attempts to reach an agreement did not lead to anything, then elance itself then decides to release the money from the account. <br><br>  Arbitration is conducted on the basis of facts obtained from the buisness terms, internal correspondence and the result of the work sent. <br><br>  They say that decisions are often made in favor of the performer, but I can neither confirm nor deny. <br><br><h5>  Withdrawal of funds </h5><br>  Getting the first payment is also a pleasure to receive the first girl <br><br>  Very simple, two good options: <br><br>  1. Transfer to the account of individuals in a Russian bank. <br>  For example, you go to Alfabank, get yourself a plastic visa / mastercard card, gold cards are distributed practically for that, plus a lot of chips like SMS notifications about money receipt are convenient. <br><br>  Takes 2-4 working days (respectively, try to accumulate funds and throw them off once a month at the beginning of the week).  If I am not mistaken, then one withdrawal per month is free, following this month - for a fee. <br><br>  Of course, there is a question of taxes and business activities, but knowledgeable people say that if the amounts are less than $ 10k per month, you are not interested in anyone. <br><br>  2. There is a very smart option.  Elance works with Payoneer plastic cards. <br><br>  How to get a card - fill in the application form in the profile (do it immediately after registration) and wait for the envelope with the card by regular mail.  It takes 2-4 weeks, costs $ 10 - money is withdrawn when the card is activated, serviced at any ATM, withdrawal rates are acceptable. <br><br>  This completely solves the problem of delays in 2-4 days with the withdrawal of funds and potential tax problems.  Recommend. <br><br><h4>  Links to other exchanges </h4><br>  I did not work at all, but maybe someone will be interested. <br><br>  <a href="http://odesk.com/">odesk.com</a> <br>  <a href="http://guru.com/">guru.com</a> <br>  <a href="http://rentacoder.com/">rentacoder.com</a> <br><br>  However, elance is more suitable for designers. <br><br><h4>  Conclusion </h4><br>  He told everything he knew, as he gained new experience, it is possible that some new interesting moments will emerge. <br><br>  You may have the impression that working on elance is easy money.  This is not true.  To earn on freelancing, you need to work and be responsible for the result of their work. <br><br>  Do not count on the fact that you are sitting at work now, register and you will not straining to receive an increase of 1-2k $.  In addition to money, it will be very useful for many to gain experience of real work in a competitive environment outside the Russian market. <br><br>  It should also be understood that by registering on elanse, you come to an open field, where no one knows you, and your portfolio is most likely not what you need.  We will have to build the foundation of our material well-being from scratch, but it will depend only on you and will not disappear anywhere. <br>  Like everything new, it‚Äôs harder than driving, but over time your reputation will work for you, not you for it.  And now think how much the projects that you have done before this work for you (familiar company, Vasya, at work ...) <br><br>  This concludes my story about working at elance. <br>  Good luck) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/39944/">https://habr.com/ru/post/39944/</a></p>
