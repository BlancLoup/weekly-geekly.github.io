If you make an analogy with life in the company, that once in your career you will have a bad boss or at least it will be bad only for you.  Bad bosses are very diverse: slippery and insensitive, indecisive, inconsistent and unfair, there are micromanagers who suppress the desire to work and develop, as well as the ‚Äúmatador manager‚Äù - skilfully avoiding every tough question and suggestive fog.  So, the question is not whether or not you will have such a boss, but what you will do when you get him. <br><br>  Facing such a boss face-to-face, many people pass, complaining about it with their whining colleagues or taking the passive position ‚Äúsomeday it will end - you just have to endure‚Äù.  Or in the case of an extremely negative relationship with a bad boss, an employee is forced to change jobs and often with bad recommendations. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/bed/a27/ec5/beda27ec56074b89e2a9ed320aade1e5.jpg">

      What to do?  Read under the cut. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  To begin with, faced with such a bad boss, you should understand the following things. <br><br>  First, your boss, regardless of whether he is effective or not, is the main influencing factor in your work and he plays a key role in shaping ideas about you, your work and your prospects for higher authorities. <br><br>  Secondly, in most organizations it is difficult or almost impossible to shift a boss in the short term.  And for frequent, when you start to dig under the boss, you discover that he has some special knowledge or skills that are very valuable for the company.  For example, a close relationship with the company's key clients, or he may have some special knowledge that others do not have.  Advice, having learned this, do not despair and do not follow plankton - act proactively. <br><br>  Start by understanding what you can do in this situation and what is up to you.  What are the chief goals and interests?  What is important to him?  First, calmly assess the whole situation, gather carefully all the information before proceeding to action.  Find out who your boss is, what approaches in management he uses, how he receives information - verbally, visually or audially?  How does he make a decision: independently analyzing the data obtained or based on the opinion of advisers?  Determine which areas of responsibility he will never pass on to anyone and will manage himself, and which questions you can ask delegate to you, i.e.  you will act proactively - taking responsibility for yourself.  Helping the boss to achieve his goals and actively discussing topics of interest to him, and doing this by imitating his own style (the greatest chance that he will like it) - you can begin to build trust and make your work more productive, at least while you work with him.  Just watching your boss, try to learn from him something - knowledge or skills. <br><br>  And very often, the boss sees that you are helping to do his job, he receives full information about what is happening from you, which allows the boss to keep everything under control.  This means that your efforts have been crowned with success and your relationship with your boss has become more pleasant and productive. <br><br>  Of course, this tactic is not a panacea, but it should be used if you want to have career prospects in the company in which you work.  Using such tactics make sure that the boss knows about your career ambitions.  Tell him that you are communicating with superiors from other departments or with your superior.  Of course, he may not like it, but you will be so honest with him, which means he will be more calm. <br><br>  When building your connections in a company, never criticize your current boss.  After all, communicating with other leaders, they conclude that if you come into submission to them, then you will also respond about them.  <b>The golden rule: about management and company, either good or nothing.</b> <br><br>  Try to participate in some related projects, try to ensure that your activity was noticed, and the result was evaluated positively by as many responsible people as possible.  This will give you the opportunity to be first in the list of applicants, if you open a new position in the current company for which you are ideally suited, or find a corresponding job in another company where your new competencies are required. <br><br>  At the same time, even if you leave, you will have good relations, both with a bad boss (if he will remain so for you) and with the company as a whole, which guarantees you positive recommendations and a good career as a valuable employee in the market. <br><br>  *** <br>  Poker should be played by those cards that went, and not by those that you want. <br>  And most importantly - it's poker face. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/641/2fd/98b/6412fd98b7a683ee8ddb999c4cc2f9e6.png"><br><br>  The post is based on the article <a href="http://blogs.hbr.org/cs/2012/06/dealing_with_a_bad_boss.html">Dealing with a Bad Boss by John Beeson</a> <br>  I did not begin to make out as a translation, since the meaning remained the same, but the translation itself is somewhat voluntary.  It is even better to say, adapted to Russia. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/147013/">https://habr.com/ru/post/147013/</a></p>
