There were ancient reasons for the heavy workload, which really is good news.  =) <br><br>  So.  On the first day of the conference, the LOVATA Group studio in the amount of 2 people went to this event: Pavel Lovtsevich and Sergey Atanasov.  We immediately decided that we would not go to the beginning of registration, because  nothing interesting from the outset was not foreseen.  Therefore, having slept perfectly, I drove by Sergey for a car, and we went to the Yunost JCC, which is located on the picturesque coast of the Minsk Sea (I took pictures of the sea later from the 11th floor of the complex). <br><br><img src="http://images.lovata.com/photos/DI-2007/IMG_0574.JPG" alt="Business Internet - 2007">

    <a name="habracut"></a><br><br><img src="http://images.lovata.com/photos/DI-2007/IMG_0575.JPG" alt="Business Internet - 2007"><br><br>  We arrived at the place near the beginning of the 12th day, where we were greeted with a banner with a greeting in the best traditions of the USSR, if we ignore the sponsors' logos. <br><br><img src="http://images.lovata.com/photos/DI-2007/IMG_0556.JPG" alt="Business Internet - 2007"><br><br>  In the lobby, we were met by pretty girls who registered participants in the event. <br><br><img src="http://images.lovata.com/photos/DI-2007/photos.tut.by-01.jpg" alt="Business Internet - 2007"><br><br><img src="http://images.lovata.com/photos/DI-2007/photos.tut.by-02.jpg" alt="Business Internet - 2007"><br><br>  In addition, they handed out just such a freebie.  =) <br><br><img src="http://images.lovata.com/photos/DI-2007/photos.tut.by-04.jpg" alt="Business Internet - 2007"><br><br>  We still had time to attend the conference part of the event in the main hall (cinema). <br><br><img src="http://images.lovata.com/photos/DI-2007/IMG_0560.JPG" alt="Business Internet - 2007"><br><br>  Fedor Korolenko spoke about the situation in Bynet in numbers.  By the way, here is his promised photo. <br><br><img src="http://images.lovata.com/photos/DI-2007/photos.tut.by-05.jpg" alt="Business Internet - 2007"><br><br>  As usual, he did not disregard his speech: <br><br>  “… There is no sex on the Bainet, and after the dating sites are covered up, it is not expected, apparently.” <br><br>  “... I congratulate you Yury Anatolyevich, people in search engines are looking for the portal tut.by!” <br><br>  In general, he clarified the data of his report at the previous conference “Bynet 2.0 ″. <br><br>  In general, the conference was held in three rooms: <br><ol><li>  Cinema </li><li>  Coffee room </li><li>  Conference hall </li></ol><br>  Then we decided to visit the Payments section on the Internet.  However, they made a mistake with the hall and got to some side event on marketing.  As a result, we missed the report of Andrei Leonovich on the subject " <br>  Prospects for the development of WebMoney in Belarus. ”By the way, this was not the last time we mistakenly fell into the wrong section. <br><br>  The report by Oleg Veremeychik “Analysis and prospects for the development of payments by bank cards on the Internet” and his subsequent discussion opened up a depressing picture to the public.  It turns out that our banks are <strong>forced to</strong> respond to the needs of the market, they are not going to offer anything. <br><br><img src="http://images.lovata.com/photos/DI-2007/IMG_0565.JPG" alt="Business Internet - 2007"><br><br>  Alexander Shostak presented his report “Payment by bank cards on the Internet: the payment system works in detail” in the form “for the smallest”. <br><br>  In general, the speakers dealt with those of Internet banking, Internet acquiring rather superficially, without taking into account the fact that the public has gathered IT-oriented and is interested in more details than general phrases. <br><br><img src="http://images.lovata.com/photos/DI-2007/IMG_0569.JPG" alt="Business Internet - 2007"><br><br>  Then we went to the section “Experience of using the Internet in state organizations”.  Approximately by the middle of the report “High-Tech Crimes” by Igor Parmon and Alexander Makarevich.  In principle, there was something to listen to, especially to the public, unrelated to jurisprudence. <br><br><img src="http://images.lovata.com/photos/DI-2007/IMG_0570.JPG" alt="Business Internet - 2007"><br><br><img src="http://images.lovata.com/photos/DI-2007/IMG_0571.JPG" alt="Business Internet - 2007"><br><br>  Then there was something.  The report by Matvey Braginsky "Internet technologies as an element of interaction between the state and the population."  Nothing is clear, apparently, our state.  The authorities themselves do not yet know how to properly and effectively apply such a powerful tool as the Internet in working with the public. <br><br><img src="http://images.lovata.com/photos/DI-2007/IMG_0573.JPG" alt="Business Internet - 2007"><br><br>  “... the results of your tests (in the clinic) can be viewed on the Internet.” <br><br>  At the same time, the speaker first did not give any guarantees of the security of viewing such confidential data, then he realized himself and began to say the opposite. <br><br>  The presenter of the section, Andrei Shubaderov, also presented his report on the topic “Basic aspects of ensuring the security of state bodies, organizations, enterprises when using the Internet”.  Pearls below. <br><br>  “... our boys play computer games, and the girls go to the army, because there are men there, in real life they are hard to find!” :) <br><br>  “... the site of the Ministry of Defense often receives messages, here is my neighbor, a healthy guy, drives cars, loves my girls.  They do not call him into the army, but they call me.  And the contact details of this neighbor.  This information, coming to the Minister, goes with the team "Deal!" Time passes and the guy is called.  Someone will say: “Thirty-seventh year!” However, behind the slope of this guy is a doctor and a military commissar because of the image of the sun! ” <br><br>  The report was very good and the speaker did not disappoint. <br><br>  Next was lunch. <br><br>  Food.  It is necessary to thank the organizers for the good coffee breaks. <br><br><img src="http://images.lovata.com/photos/DI-2007/photos.tut.by-06.jpg" alt="Business Internet - 2007"><br><br><img src="http://images.lovata.com/photos/DI-2007/photos.tut.by-07.jpg" alt="Business Internet - 2007"><br><br><img src="http://images.lovata.com/photos/DI-2007/photos.tut.by-10.jpg" alt="Business Internet - 2007"><br><br>  And the dinner itself was served in the canteen of the Yunost complex, on the whole, quite well, not a restaurant of course, but given the quite affordable price (about $ 3.5), it was a sin to complain. <br><br>  Our next visit was to honor the continuation of the section Internet providers and technologies. <br>  “Home Networking.  Problems and prospects of interaction "Sergey Oleynikov first caused controversial judgments and the degree of awareness of the speaker in the topic under discussion.  Because  I myself am not the last to relate to the home networks of Minsk, I was surprised at the level of the report because the speaker was, as it turned out later, also an active character in the community of home networks in Belarus. <br><br><img src="http://images.lovata.com/photos/DI-2007/IMG_0578.JPG" alt="Business Internet - 2007"><br>  Next came the Search Engine Marketing section.  The first report of Mikhail Kozlov “Effective campaigns of promotion in search engines.  Search engine promotion strategy.  Search engine optimization sites and contextual advertising as a way to attract visitors from search engines ”I really liked, as a person unfamiliar with this industry web. <br><br>  After the next coffee break, the Management and Development of Web Projects section started, which Denis Petelin gave a start with a good report “Software Software Economy - Why Donate Money?” Although many questions remained about the validity given by the speaker of the theses. <br><br>  Next was the annealing performed by Alexei Shorkin on the theme “Consulting approach in web development”.  After his speech, as noted by Yuri (Shilyaev and Zisser), they had nothing to add.  The report was very dynamic and fascinating, besides, it was one of the few truly useful.  Pay attention to the part of the thesis behind his back ... =) <br><br><img src="http://images.lovata.com/photos/DI-2007/photos.tut.by-11.jpg" alt="Business Internet - 2007"><br><br>  Yury Shilyaev presented his report with a similar approach to the submission, which was demonstrated to them in a company with Yury Vetrov at the Bynet 2.0 conference.  Everything is good, but my IMHO, less democratic need to be with the staff.  I say this as his former subordinate.  Although he is the most pleasant person and overall a great leader. <br><br><img src="http://images.lovata.com/photos/DI-2007/photos.tut.by-12.jpg" alt="Business Internet - 2007"><br><br>  The first day in this section was closed with the expectedly strong reports “Team spirit and democracy as the key to success of the Internet project” by Yuri Zisser and “How to create a technologically reliable startup?” By Dmitry Kruglov and Maxim Baryshnikov. <br><br>  Next was the banquet, which we decided to skip. <br><br><img src="http://images.lovata.com/photos/DI-2007/photos.tut.by-13.jpg" alt="Business Internet - 2007"><br><br><img src="http://images.lovata.com/photos/DI-2007/photos.tut.by-14.jpg" alt="Business Internet - 2007"><br><br><img src="http://images.lovata.com/photos/DI-2007/photos.tut.by-16.jpg" alt="Business Internet - 2007"><br><br><img src="http://images.lovata.com/photos/DI-2007/photos.tut.by-17.jpg" alt="Business Internet - 2007"><br><br>  Day two began for us with a cheerful report “Advertising of women's goods on the Internet” by Elena Korovets, continued with speeches “Non-standard receptions and media in Internet advertising.  Indirect Action Strategy ”by Mark Bernstein,“ Video advertising on the Internet ”by Natalia Sinkevich. <br><br>  Then, by mistake, we mistakenly got into the Content.BY section and missed the much-awaited report by guest guru Alexey Kopylov, “Ajax — the exciting capabilities of new interfaces or the programmer's bad dream?”.  We have already found only the last report of the section of Sergey Baidachny on the topic “Using Live Technologies”.  On which I managed to bit a little a couple of cues from the hall.  =) <br><br><img src="http://images.lovata.com/photos/DI-2007/IMG_0585.JPG" alt="Business Internet - 2007"><br><br><img src="http://images.lovata.com/photos/DI-2007/IMG_0587.JPG" alt="Business Internet - 2007"><br><br>  At this point we decided to end our visit to the event and went home. <br><br>  In general, I could characterize the conference as a fairly well-organized IT event with quite good reports, which has become perhaps the most popular lately in Bynet.  Next year, we will certainly, with our reports. <br><br>  Related Links: <br><ol><li>  Video on <a href="http://itv.by/showvideo/razdel/delovoyinternet.html">ITV.by.</a> </li><li> Video report from the <a href="http://naviny.by/rubrics/computer/2007/10/04/ic_media_128_1175/">Belarusian news</a> . </li><li>  Photo on <a href="http://foto.tut.by/album/11559.html">foto.tut.by.</a> </li><li>  Photos on <a href="http://analytics.bybanner.com/article/5921.html">bybanner.com</a> . </li><li>  Photo on <a href="http://inf.by/library/tag/%25E4%25E5%25EB%25EE%25E2%25EE%25E9%2B%25E8%25ED%25F2%25E5%25F0%25ED%25E5%25F2%2B2007/">inf.by.</a> </li><li>  Photos on <a href="http://forum.onliner.by/viewtopic.php%3Ft%3D523679%26amp%3Bpostdays%3D0%26amp%3Bpostorder%3Dasc%26amp%3Bstart%3D40">onliner.by</a> . </li><li>  Press release on the offsite company tut.by. </li><li>  Press release on the website of the <a href="http://www.ipr.by/ru/press/press2007/press_36.html">Institute of Public Relations</a> . </li><li>  Presentations of speakers on <a href="http://di.by/programm">offsite</a> . </li><li>  Report on <a href="http://analytics.bybanner.com/article/5920.html">bybanner.com</a> . </li><li>  Nikolay Shchetko's report on <a href="http://it.tut.by/news/97886.html">it.tut.by.</a> </li><li>  Report Yuri Shilyaeva personal <a href="http://yuri.shilyaev.com/archives/2007/10/10/376/delovoy-internet-2-itogi.html">blog</a> . </li><li>  Notes tut.by team in a <a href="http://tut.blog.tut.by/category/delovoy-internet/">corporate blog</a> . </li><li>  Site report <a href="http://s13.by/2007/10/05/delovoy-internet-biznes-internet-v-belarusi-ochen-malenkiy-dorogoy-stabilnyiy-netraditsionnyiy-i-neoriginalnyiy/">Promotion in the regions</a> . </li></ol><br>  Crosspost from <a href="http://webdev.lovata.com/">webdev.lovata.com</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/15492/">https://habr.com/ru/post/15492/</a></p>
