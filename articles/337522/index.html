But what if the standard ‚Äúcreate a regular payment‚Äù is not enough for you?  What if you need to "pay the phone every time I have a balance below a certain amount"?  Or ‚Äúmake a purchase when the price / rate falls below the threshold‚Äù?  Obviously, such complex scenarios require both access to the parameters of third-party services and access to the management of their payment instruments. <br><br>  Such as access, which gives the API wallet QIWI.  In order for as many developers as possible to learn and test the automation capabilities of their wallets through our API, QIWI holds a contest for QIWI Wallet applications, which will end in Moscow on September 23 with the final stage.  Until September 15, 15 teams will be selected to measure the quality and originality of their QIWI wallet automation options for the main prizes: a trip to the <a href="http://www.fintechfestival.sg/">Singapore FinTech Festival</a> and a business breakfast with QIWI CEO <a href="http://www.forbes.ru/profile/255063-solonin">Sergey Solonin</a> , included in the Forbes list of 200 richest businessmen in Russia.

      But even if you are not a developer, then you can help the hackathon participants and get your prize for this by reading this post to the end - we will tell you how to participate in the contest for the most promising QIWI wallet application ideas. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h3>  How did the QIWI API appear </h3><br>  There are many reasons why a programmer is cool.  One of them is the ability to automate a significant part of the daily routine associated with staying online and working with gadgets and on the computer.  Where ordinary users are forced to use ready-made solutions or do a lot with their hands, the developer can write a script that will do everything in seconds, beautifully, accurately and automatically.  Sometimes, however, the development of the script can take a lot more than it saves for all the time of its work - but the beauty of the solution is still more important.  And then, in most cases, this is really practical. <br><br>  Of course, among the multimillion army of users of QIWI wallets, there are enough of those who lacked curiosity and ability to automate the work with our services.  This allows the applied architecture of microservices interacting with each other through special requests.  Minimum programmer skills are enough to pull out the requests sent in order to pick out the details of the Wallet, or integrate the individual functions of your QIWI wallet with your own program programs. <br><br>  Noticing how, in parallel with the development of the site, a whole ecosystem of similar ‚Äúgray‚Äù third-party solutions develops in a ‚Äúgray‚Äù mode, not legalized in the user agreement and not provided by our support, we decided to legalize it at some point - Citibank, Wargaming and Vkontakte - to streamline the download of data from the site.  So in April, the first version of the user API appeared. <br><br>  And now we have decided to support such activity, offering developers not only to submit their ideas to the public, but also urging the public to tell the developers what other options are possible to automate the work with the QIWI wallet through the service API. <br><br><h3>  How to take part in the competition if I am not a programmer </h3><br>  Easy.  Although the implementation of ideas will, of course, be engaged by developers, to formulate a task for them, by everyone‚Äôs power.  For example, thinking about some unnecessary or routine operations that have to be done through online payment services. <br><br>  You can combine ideas from different areas: for example, QIWI wallet and smart contracts - how do you like the service that automatically pays for freelancers when an order is marked on the service as completed?  Or betting service, which transfers money to the winners on the basis of sports matches. <br><br>  The combination of the capabilities of the API wallet with AI opens up an even wider scope for imagination: any voice assistant a la Siri with your QIWI wallet turns into a whole Jarvis, able to manage the entire household, listening to user commands. <br><br>  With the help of a QR code scanner, which since July 1 is now on every check in Russian stores, such an application could keep track of personal expenses.  And yet such an application can be a piggy bank, listing a part of all receipts to another savings account.  And even a personal broker, following stock prices or cryptocurrencies, and making purchases. <br><br>  Of course, you can approach the task more formally by studying <a href="https://developer.qiwi.com/ru/qiwicom/index.html">the QIWI API documentation</a> - but we think that any user can give a valuable idea by simply describing their need.  At this stage, not its elaboration is important, but the uniqueness, value, originality and potential mass character.  We will mark the top 10 of them right in the comments at the beginning of the next week and award them with certificates for the replenishment of a QIWI wallet for 1000‚ÇΩ. <br><br>  And teams planning or having the opportunity to take in the hackathon on September 23, we encourage comments to read, choose ideas for the soul and <a href="https://inspirussia.timepad.ru/event/557373/">feel free to register</a> .  The selection will last until September 15. <br><br><h3>  Just for your eyes </h3><br>  Almost all types of operations with the wallet through the API require a user token request to access it.  Without it, the data set that a third-party application can work with is extremely poor ‚Äî practically only with data on commissions, and only that.  Token gives four access levels: <br><br><ul><li>  to user profile information; </li><li>  to the Wallet balance; </li><li>  to payment history; </li><li>  and full access to making payments. </li></ul><br>  In other words, the transfer of a token with first to third access rights is equivalent to leaving your personal account on the QIWI wallet site open on a public computer, while the token with full rights is also an unlocked phone to which the wallet is attached, lying next to it. <br><br>  It is clear that we cannot yet allow the development of applications requesting access to tokens.  Therefore, the QIWI contest is rather a prototype review, rather than a mass decision.  Anyone can take the source code of the application-finalists on the same Github, compile it in themselves, substituting their parameters in the token_access parameter - but for now and only. <br><br><h3>  Idea contest </h3><br>  Leave your ideas right in the comments.  If you do not have an account or an invite, it‚Äôs not scary, every user has the right to register a read &amp; comment account with comments that are included in pre-moderation, but we will miss all your suggestions. <br><br>  Recall that the ten ideas, marked the most promising for QIWI employees, will be awarded on September 12th with a winning thousand rubles for QIWI Wallets. <br><br>  In turn, developers can safely read comments, choose ideas and register to participate in the selection of finalists on September 23: <a href="https://inspirussia.timepad.ru/event/557373/">inspirussia.timepad.ru/event/557373</a> <br><br>  Go! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/337522/">https://habr.com/ru/post/337522/</a></p>
