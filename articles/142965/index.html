These are mainly tips (in the manner of a certain famous website about tips) to ‚Äúsysadmins‚Äù who work ‚Äúfor themselves‚Äù, in small and medium businesses, as well as in state organizations. <br><br>  The rules helped me ‚Äúin one‚Äù to have a park in the city of Novosibirsk 100‚Äì150 computers without losing the quality of work and situations when my services were refused and not get tired for even my family. <br><br>  It is very difficult at a time when there is a task, but you cannot consult with someone. <br>  Now communication has replaced the Internet and forums, earlier it was only sleepless nights and experiments (for example, to have a special computer in our technical department, on which we tested viruses and studied how they work and how to treat them).

      I am sure that these tips will help someone, and someone will cause nostalgia for this profession. <br><br>  1. The client is the most important thing we have in the admin case!  This accountant and technicals. <br>  2. Archives are what separates us from ‚Äúdeath‚Äù, careless competitors and our good reputation. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  3. The latest versions of programs and updates are IMPORTANT and for some reason they are released, so everything needs to be updated: both software and firmware, and, first, on their computers or devices.  Accountants are particularly important updated programs, as they have interest, reports, forms and your salary.  Do it at a time when nobody works. <br>  4. Assume when the end of the cartridge at the customer and order (change) in advance.  Have a spare. <br>  5. Keep documentation on clients, passwords, accesses, addresses, mail, servers, etc.  to ensure that your colleagues do not fight hysterically due to lack of information. <br>  6. Study the documentation before doing. <br>  7. Do not confuse plus and minus. <br>  8. Complete all the information (article, documentation) before you take action. <br>  9. Draw on a piece of paper, think over the structure well, so as not to redo it. <br>  10. Lay on an hour or two more time than in terms of "great challenges." <br>  11. Make the information and structure simple and easily accessible. <br>  12. Keep all drivers in the near place. <br>  13. The Internet is not only designed for "admins", but also other people work - "turn off the torrent"! <br>  14. Look, read, explore the news of the IT industry, choose your strengths profession, move in this, save up the experience, share it and ask how others do.  Choose or know everything a little, or become a narrow specialist. <br>  15. Install proven software and not new, new software requires more of your time and attention - check out new features and technologies for yourself. <br>  16. Explain clearly.  Replace the concepts ‚Äúin it‚Äù, ‚Äúthere‚Äù, ‚Äúin the Word program‚Äù, ‚Äúin the input field‚Äù, ‚Äúin the taskbar‚Äù and your client will understand your language.  You build bridges with clients and restore the tarnished reputation of ‚Äúsystem administrators‚Äù and programmers, and at the same time teach your clients computer literacy. <br>  17. Many non-computer people "sysadmin" programmer, installer, electrician and installer - one person "programmer" - get used to it. <br>  18. Arrange in advance with the client, inform about the meeting or warn that the meeting will not take place.  Respect other people. <br>  19. Learn the language of "foreign" professions - this will save your time and them, as well as arouse trust in the client. <br>  20. Do ‚Äúas yourself,‚Äù even if the client wants to ‚Äúquickly‚Äù and take time into account at the same time. <br>  21. Do IMPORTANT and NOT URGENT in the first place - do not panic in the future. <br>  22. Someone needs figures, and to whom surely ‚ÄúI will do everything well‚Äù - take into account who you are talking to. <br>  23. Create a rule to call folders (folder structures) everywhere the same, which would explain to the user without hesitation by telephone.  Do so that the absence of you does not cause negative situations. <br>  24. You install a new computer - copy the drivers of this computer to the hard disk, it will help to visit the client in those cases when there is no ‚Äúflash drive‚Äù, no disks, no Internet.  Save your time. <br>  25. Users work during the day, and servers work at night.  Servers themselves must copy, archive, check, reboot, run and send reports! <br>  26. Monitor servers more than client computers.  Server is more often the heart of the organization than the file of the user.  Do not confuse the user and accounting, there is an annual report on the "weight" of the server. <br>  27. Do not bend prices, prices are not a reason to lose a client.  Look for customers who pay for the fact that everything works, and not for what you have in front of your eyes. <br>  28. Do not scold the software different from yours, better tell why you use it. <br>  29. Let the client choose, even if you know what he needs.  Any choice of his discuss in any case. <br>  30. Come to work 30 minutes earlier, check the performance of the ‚Äúnetwork‚Äù - sellers earn you money. <br>  31. Smile and be calm for your work. <br>  32. Do not scold other "admins", it takes you away from the positive image of "admins" and therefore "admins" to put it mildly "not good". <br>  33. Know where all the paper documents, statements, certificates, reports, "guarantees" are located. <br>  34. Get ready before going to the client, and have a spare "small things" in the "trunk". <br>  35. Screwdrivers and tester only yours! <br>  36. Sign the wires, but it is not clear to others what is going where. <br>  37. Find a way to save money in an organization without losing time and quality; in the IT field this is possible. <br>  38. Offer new approaches and acceleration of business processes or do not interfere with the existing system. <br>  39. Do not translate clients as friends, you cannot earn money with friends. <br>  40. Installing the operating system and software, set up and remove unnecessary from startup.  Find out the list of client software and install it.  Have your "gentleman's set" of software and install it. <br>  41. For the average user, desktop shortcuts are closer than in the ‚ÄúSTART‚Äù menu, but do not allow a large number of them. <br>  42. Keep some software on the Internet on your page with access only for you. <br>  43. Learn all ways to work remotely with computers and protect them from penetration. <br>  44. Develop with the boss levels of access to network resources. <br>  45. Do something extra in your work that will help you in the future to avoid unforeseen situations. <br>  46. ‚Äã‚ÄãKnow the colors, icons and the names of all the programs that you install, as well as their location. <br>  47. The deadlines in official documents indicate that the work must be completed before the start of this date, but not after.  In general, the timing is important. <br>  48. Choose suppliers with quality.  Quality will allow not to appear at the client and to find new.  Word of mouth will work for you after the first well-executed task. <br>  49. Have the opportunity in the form of a "call a friend" or "help the hall" in a difficult situation and replace yourself with a vacation. <br>  50. Be available on all contacts that everyone should know.  Take the phone when ringing and do not change phone numbers.  Clients happen, do not call for years because everything works for them. <br><br>  <i>As the saying goes, ‚ÄúWhat I wish for you and dear habrovtsy!‚Äù</i> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/142965/">https://habr.com/ru/post/142965/</a></p>
