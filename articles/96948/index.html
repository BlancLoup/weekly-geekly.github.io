  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Netbook, where you can play - ASUS 1201T</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  There was a task - to choose a small (10 "-13") laptop, on which one could not only work (browser, mail, office) but also play, albeit at minimum settings, but without obvious brakes.  In Crysis, of course, no one was going to play, but sometimes they love to run in World of Warcraft or go to NFS.  That is, I needed a balanced laptop computer - moderately smart, moderately light, moderately cheap (I wanted to meet thousands of 15-17). <br><br>  Netbooks on the Atom + GMA950 / 500 immediately fell off - WoW on average gave out 10-12 fps at 1024x768, at 800x600 it got a little better, but you could forget about the comfortable game. <br>  Laptops like my Acer 1410, on the CULVs with the GMA 4500MHD, provide an average FPS of around 25-30, don't like raids, but you can already play.  Unfortunately, they have practically disappeared from sale, especially the variants with the dual-core SU2300?  and what remains - has risen in price by 150 bucks.  I took a laptop in March for 16 thousand, and now the average index price for it is about 20 thousand. <br><br>  Therefore, the choice ultimately came down to the <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/lenovo/blog/87290/">Lenovo X100e</a> (Athlon Neo + Radeon), <a href="http://www.fcenter.ru/eshop.shtml%3F90117">ASUS 1201NL</a> (Atom N270 + ION) and <a href="http://www.fcenter.ru/eshop.shtml%3F88668">ASUS 1201T</a> (Athlon Neo + Radeon). <br><img src="http://i7.fastpic.ru/big/2010/0621/39/a1202666be36c9ec8171e6a90a974439.jpg"><img src="http://i7.fastpic.ru/big/2010/0621/82/f3ea1f02305ca7b63c0959dbb8ed1082.jpg"><img src="http://i7.fastpic.ru/big/2010/0621/57/dcbc2b8bdff321091c7f18b47b904a57.jpg">

    <a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b>x100e</b> dropped due to design.  Although he is just very cute to me and I seriously thought about buying one at one time, but now the decision was not mine.  I noticed that the design of Lenovo's laptops is usually liked by boys, and in girls it causes rejection.  <b>1201NL</b> , in spite of the more productive video and lower price, was dropped due to a weaker processor, less RAM, a smaller screw and the lack of Bluetooth.  So in the end <b>ASUS 1201T</b> was purchased. <br><br>  I will not post many pictures, the benefit of <a href="http://geektimes.ru/users/boomburum/" class="user_link">Boomburum</a> has already done a <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/asus/blog/92093/">review of a close relative of</a> this machine.  The case is exactly the same, the pros and cons are similar, all claims for gloss are in place. <br><br>  And I will write a little about personal impressions, but I will conduct a couple of comparative tests.  Basically, I will compare with the Acer 1410 (Celeron Dual Core 1200 / 4GB) and the Roverbook Neo U100L (aka MSI Wind U100) - I have the first one now, I used the second for a year and a half.  For good, you should compare it with some ion netbook, but I don‚Äôt have them, so I‚Äôll have to refer to other people's tests. <br><br><h5>  General impressions </h5><br><br>  In general, I liked the laptop - a comfortable keyboard (although with fast typing it is pushed in places), quite small dimensions and weight, decent screen sizes and resolution (for 1024x600 in my old U100 I managed to get it). <br>  Glossy, yes.  But they are all like that now.  I attached a sticker to my cover, it does not look very neat, but at least the fingerprints are not so noticeable.  This, it seems, will also be plastered, at least on top. <br>  The touchpad is pleasant, thanks to the pimples, it is quickly groped, unlike the laptops, where it is made flush with the case.  The swing button is not always convenient (sometimes you have to press two buttons at once), but this is compensated by multitouch. <br><br><h5>  Screen </h5><br><br>  For the netbook - the most it.  "That same color, that same size ..." The matrix is ‚Äã‚Äãbetter than that of the Acer 1410, the viewing angles are bigger.  And the screen diagonal, it seems, is just for this resolution - I didn‚Äôt even have an idea to increase the font size.  Although it would seem, with 11.6 "the difference is only half an inch. <br><br><h5>  Processor and video </h5><br><img src="http://i7.fastpic.ru/big/2010/0621/42/bd6192ba144f6af183cd2d802d3cf042.png" alt="image"><img src="http://i7.fastpic.ru/big/2010/0621/41/eef30c6ade07e734a38f4cdbbb754341.png" alt="image"><br><br>  The numbers written in italics nadergal from the rating <a href="http://www.notebookcheck-ru.com/Reiting-mobilnykh-processorov-sravnenie-proizvoditelnosti.14099.0.html">plate</a> of mobile processors, because I either don‚Äôt have this processor at hand (I don‚Äôt have the N270, I have 330), or I‚Äôd lazy to drive the 3D Mark. <br><table><tbody><tr><td></td><td>  SuperPi 2M </td><td>  wPrime 32M </td><td>  3D Mark06 CPU </td></tr><tr><td>  Atom n270 </td><td>  <i>211</i> </td><td>  <i>143</i> </td><td>  <i>479</i> </td></tr><tr><td>  Atom 330 </td><td>  233 </td><td>  103 </td><td>  <i>825</i> </td></tr><tr><td>  <b>Athlon Neo MV-40</b> </td><td>  163 </td><td>  138 </td><td>  <i>601</i> </td></tr><tr><td>  Celeron SU2300 </td><td>  103 </td><td>  81 </td><td>  <i>1000</i> </td></tr></tbody></table><br><br>  Reproduces movies without problems, hardware video acceleration works.  Although it consumes processor time more than 4500MHD.  40-50% against 10-15.  Not ideal, but try running Avatar's remix on a normally atomic netbook.  :) Unfortunately, there is no HDMI, so connect to the TV only via DSUB. <br><br>  Subjective performance significantly exceeds the single-core atom.  That is, to work Athlon Neo is preferable to the Atom N270.  Although the Atom N270 + ION games make Athlon Neo + Radeon with a one and a half times superiority.  But by lowering the comfort of everyday work.  So, as a universal netbook, on which not only do you want to play, but also edit pictures (for example, edit (cut, rotate, etc.) on trivia), solutions with an atlon seem to me better than with an atom.  Although I would still like to see the dual-core version ... <br><br><h5>  Memory </h5><br><img src="http://i7.fastpic.ru/big/2010/0622/c3/8ae68f49d72cbb009de65d01329f1ac3.jpg" alt="image"><br>  Memory as a memory.  There is one module, you can put another one.  But then you have to change the OS. <br><br><h5>  Nutrition </h5><br><br>  Battery life is 2 hours and 20 minutes of play in WoW with simultaneous downloading of torrents (via Wi-Fi).  So, I think it‚Äôs realistic to get 3.5-4 hours. <br><br>  The power supply and cable are quite large.  The power supply unit is one and a half times larger than the power supply units of most similar laptops, and the power cable is a standard euro-plug.  Okay, at least the wire itself is shortened.  But you still need to change to a more compact one. <br><br><h5>  operating system </h5><br><br>  The operating system is Windows 7 Starter (Initial).  Someone will say "take down and put XP / 7 Ultimate."  To which I ask the question "what does not suit you in the initial?" <br>  The main disadvantages of Starter: <br>  1. Memory support only up to 2 gigabytes.  It is unpleasant, but clearly not on a computer of this configuration. <br>  2. There is no possibility to create a home group, you can only join it.  Again - weakly imagine the creation of a home group with a netbook - either a desktop or a home server.  Since netbooks tend to periodically leave the home network. <br>  3. There is no Aero.  The disadvantage is significant, but considering that they used to put XP on netbooks, in which there is no Aero either, everything remained as it was. <br>  4. No multi-monitor support.  Poorly. <br>  5. There is no fast switching between users.  On netbooks usually one user. <br>  6. You can not change the wallpaper.  Very bad.  But ASUS specifically for such cases released a utility called <a href="">ASUS System Setting</a> . <br><br>  So, in fact, we have three insignificant drawbacks, one bypassed and two such that can really lead to OS replacement, but by no means all. In general, I consider Windows 7 Starter to be a successful replacement for Windows XP Home as an operating system for netbooks and cheap laptops.  And I don‚Äôt see much sense in changing (until I stop arranging, and not just out of love to put Ultimate :)). <br><br><h4>  A little performance test: </h4><br>  <b>Atom 330 + ION (1.6GHz, 2GB)</b> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/126/b22/d1a/126b22d1ae6274b35845852f4f291cc6.png" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>Celeron Dual Core SU2300 + GMA4500MHD (1.2GHz, 4GB)</b> <br><img src="http://i7.fastpic.ru/big/2010/0620/a8/ac51becf103929c91b294acf1f6e19a8.png"><br><br>  <b>Athlon Neo + Radeon HD3200</b> <br><img src="http://i7.fastpic.ru/big/2010/0620/43/0daf100b6898bc341e95c9af5a7c5643.png"><br><br>  Well, since it was bought for WoW, it would be strange not to drive its built-in benchmark.

It is somewhat more expensive than necessary, but in general - not bad.  Noteworthy competitors are listed at the beginning of the article. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/96948/">https://habr.com/ru/post/96948/</a></p>
