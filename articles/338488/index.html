In our team of ten fighters, only three had previously participated in such competitions.  The rest had little idea what it was.  Some, as subsequent events showed, were very, very poorly aware of what was awaiting them! <br><br>  An exhausting race with a bunch of difficult obstacles.  Dirt to the waist, cold water, high fences, rukohody, tanks, barbed wire ... Injuries (two people had a leg cramped, one beat off a knee) and a sharp decline of strength ... It all happened - but it didn't matter on the track: we did not stop, breathed in the back of competitors and "ate" them one by one! <br><br>  Our team probably wasn‚Äôt the strongest physically, but she was definitely strong in spirit!  The result - immediately the third place in our first Race of Heroes!

      See below photo report, as it were. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/e35/bdc/b3d/e35bdcb3ddd8484f9c76bc9224dbfac1.jpg"></div><a name="habracut"></a><br>  This summer, I unexpectedly took part in the Race of Heroes and after a while I stumble upon a separate IT Championship of the Race of Heroes.  It turns out that on September 16, the organizers decided to make a separate test - a competition among the teams of IT companies.  Our leadership supports almost any of our creative, so we quickly get an acceptance and put together a team. <br><br>  Before the start of the whole week.  Everything is ready with the organizers - booklets, dummies, etc.  We have - nothing yet.  But for our all-powerful PR manager Xenia, this is not a problem.  She quickly agreed with everyone, and now, one day before the start, all issues are resolved - we are ready to participate in full uniforms and inspiration! <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/1ad/c9c/90f/1adc9c90f89b4e79a413f0eb39d44781.jpg"></div><br>  In total, 8 teams participated in the IT Championship.  In each team - 10 people.  In addition to the LANIT team, teams from Kaspersky (3 platoons), Group-IB, SEGMENTO, ITelligence, and CargoOn Lab LLC took part in the competition.  The others, apparently, were frightened and immediately surrendered ;-). <br><br>  We started the last but one.  This created additional difficulties, as other teams could delay our progress.  But on the other hand, it gave an additional incentive to catch up and overtake the next competitors. <br><br>  The length of the track is 10 km, the number of obstacles is 61 pieces.  We need to overcome the entire track.  You can not lose anyone or forget somewhere in the trench.  Everyone has two attempts at passing obstacles.  If someone fails the test, then a penalty point is calculated equal to one minute.  To get to the finish line should the whole team, otherwise - disqualification.  By the way, only 6 teams out of 8 started the finish. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/930/95d/d23/93095dd2301641af86daad6cfb5bf17d.jpg"></div>  Last photo where we are clean and funny.  After registration, we take pictures of our memory alive and healthy and go to the starting field! <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/584/cca/553/584cca553ba04c86bf24eeb7db819cb5.jpg"></div>  There we meet our instructor Alexander.  He immediately hints at $ 2 million in exchange for help in passing the track.  Ufff ... I had to run honestly. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/7f1/d98/3d8/7f1d983d83a94f60be710e4ff685a031.jpg"></div>  First 30 minutes warm-up and short instructions on how to best pass the obstacles. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/1ac/49e/c30/1ac49ec30aa7433da959c8c3b6b33053.jpg"></div>  Before the start, the last instructions and proposal to change your mind is not too late ... <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/6e4/f7e/204/6e4f7e2048844d1ea05d8d875a1e5098.jpg"></div>  The very first obstacle makes you think that there is some kind of trick. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/1b0/033/877/1b00338773604ab09f49982fb8137c80.jpg"></div>  Well, forget ... Then everything will be fine. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/a81/b97/0b0/a81b970b0195483c93bbd00745a8d2d1.jpg"></div>  You have to cling to all parts of the body.  In the water somehow reluctance. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/fcf/956/190/fcf95619078549039025d4c02f3aee42.jpg"></div>  Next you need to crawl about 20 meters under barbed wire.  Around someone firing Kalash or whatever they have. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/992/2dd/c15/9922ddc154314efe81a623cbc012346f.jpg"></div>  Obstacles do not get lower. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/ba3/e6c/8e1/ba3e6c8e1e254fd2a0278efa6d6e0ff9.jpg"></div>  Got out of another puddle.  There are 5 seconds per photo. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/a68/73c/4d9/a6873c4d96744ee596c73c99500d8d4d.jpg"><br>  And go!  Forward!  Go for the victory!  Rest on retirement! <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/d4d/32d/ae3/d4d32dae32714776a25492b64ac3a9b1.jpg"></div>  That you are not in tanchiki at the computer all night blunt! <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/78a/ba7/83e/78aba783e586401f9f531d35f1de2803.jpg"></div>  Heat the most important parts of the body. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/822/2c1/1e0/8222c11e0c8743cf9c24dfff9f1a3956.jpg"></div>  Again, climb and again just that - in the water!  For a missed obstacle - a penalty of 1 point, so everyone tries as soon as they can. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/751/75f/0a4/75175f0a46a3406bb35eb9b7fce74c63.jpg"></div>  Obstacles must not be missed.  One is difficult, but in the team - the most it. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/623/0e3/824/6230e38241344fd481a12904410e9124.jpg"></div>  The detachment of fighters rushes forward. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/f6b/366/0a6/f6b3660a69764f2bbd9b580e6d32eed0.jpg">  Another opportunity to swim in the cool waters. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/a3e/103/f83/a3e103f832ae4742a3b267d321028b4a.jpg"></div>  And we just need to go there. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/c2a/cfb/e74/c2acfbe749ce48fcb008615835c2799a.jpg"></div>  Some fighters halfway through were hit by an enemy bullet, but we are not throwing ours. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/f79/438/26d/f7943826d1c5489887c95f9641b94e9a.jpg"></div><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/ece/7f6/747/ece7f67478f4493cab20d42cd024634f.jpg">  This is our favorite obstacle. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/551/2ae/546/5512ae5467fa457e906ad2035637f1db.jpg"></div>  Timur: ‚ÄúAgain, water!  But how much more will it be! ‚Äù <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/90a/5d9/557/90a5d95572924d96b0e29977f34a3607.jpg">  Height taken. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/fe5/b43/2dc/fe5b432dc08546e18cee9c8b8b386d01.jpg"><br>  And forward again!  Rest only in our dreams. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/cd3/ec7/f49/cd3ec7f49339458bb0a6dcb340b64273.jpg"></div>  Again work, work ... ahead of competitors, we must get them.  Instructor Sasha, meanwhile, is posing far away - that's someone having fun. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/e39/294/3c0/e392943c0a0144c697d67ee4001f5396.jpg"></div>  Mom and daughter cheerfully overcome obstacles.  Probably, the participation of two generations is an unprecedented event in the Race of Heroes. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/c7a/5c5/042/c7a5c5042dbd45a2b9ef8344f135bf2a.jpg"></div>  Detachment out of the environment.  We go to the periscope depth.  Some have already started to turn on the autopilot. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/e35/bdc/b3d/e35bdcb3ddd8484f9c76bc9224dbfac1.jpg"></div>  Half way passed.  It seems to have not lost anyone. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/8a6/ce3/801/8a6ce38018964009834d2e67e0d5af2f.jpg">  Alexey met the two girls and gallantly leads both on the arm during an easy walk through the park. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/1d3/f9b/385/1d3f9b3855a64387bd38b8ab7da1964e.jpg"></div>  The frame somehow hit the legs of our photographer. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/9cf/d37/434/9cfd374347774da6bb76b51e0d8686fc.jpg"></div>  Fantasy organizers know no bounds.  Only dirt remains unchanged. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/baa/06f/c58/baa06fc589174194a0dd44090cca7a0c.jpg"></div>  Guys need to go completely by themselves, but for the girls made a small exception - they can ride a riding colleague. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/329/46c/0b7/32946c0b7ed54840a164b1ba6869321d.jpg"></div>  It may seem that Zhenya is resting, but this is not quite so.  He is born again (the so-called obstacle). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/38a/d93/8e2/38ad938e26a74a4fbd7aeee964ee3f03.jpg"><br>  Poor our legs.  Why am I not doing stretching in the morning? <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/a5c/72c/f9a/a5c72cf9a122412eab4324fb2efd9a60.jpg"></div> The sea will swell violently ... and they will find themselves on a coast, in scales as the heat of grief, thirty-three bogatyrs. <br>  We have reached!  Only one thing remains, but the most important obstacle is the seven-meter Everest. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/7c5/20a/c3e/7c520ac3e7f744108f467c3160a358f4.jpg"><br>  We storm "Everest". <br><br>  At the end of the exhausting distance of 10 km and after 60 obstacles, the body refuses to obey.  But you need to make one last effort and climb this steep wall along a tightrope. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/e9a/3c7/dbb/e9a3c7dbbee94d47ae33290f97d2b039.jpg"><br>  Alexey: ‚ÄúWhat ... can I get there?‚Äù <br><br>  I manage to climb myself.  Further I help to get the rest.  Girls - pull on the rope. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/6b0/ec1/dbf/6b0ec1dbfffe454f97e105c638a5c79d.jpg"><br>  That was great.  I am proud of our team.  Despite the hardest track, convulsions, bruises, we all got in full. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/dba/28d/eb3/dba28deb37b5440fadf83fc092b4e177.JPG"></div>  Waiting for the awards ceremony we warm ourselves in a tent, eat front-line buckwheat with meat and drink sweet tea with bagels. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/e22/76c/846/e2276c846e4a40c28e8338368d78cd16.jpg"></div>  We have reached our goal!  We went through the whole route in about 3:30, got not so many penalty points.  We have overtaken many competing teams that started before us, and took the third prize.  For us, this is definitely a victory and a very high reward. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/e48/f80/23e/e48f8023e9fb4acdaa186cd8751c5697.jpg"></div>  General photo with all the winners and prize-winners.
