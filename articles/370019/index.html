Yes, yes - the one that <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/smartgadget/blog/229489/">independently develops</a> its devices in its own production in the city of Alexandrov.  There, in the Vladimir region, AdvoCam tests all its models for resistance to freezing temperatures and shaking on the roads.  And at the same time, he always organizes a test pre-production assembly of limited shipments of devices to identify and eliminate possible ‚Äújambs‚Äù and bugs before launching mass production at the facilities of Asian partner factories.  Exactly in the same way, by the way, all the world's leading giants of the portable electronics market work, including Apple. <br><br>  AdvoCam-FD8 Red II (GPS + GLONASS), which became the successor of the 2013 flagship AdvoCam-FD8 Red, was mentioned in the material among the current models of DVRs of the brand.  In the updated version, the single-system GPS was replaced with GLONASS / GPS, the top matrix of the American company OmniVision was installed with support for HDR mode (we lighten dark areas, we align the brightness of the frame).  Got a good machine for 9 500 rubles. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/8e8/485/a0a/8e8485a0abfe4c67a09f55c32970b377.jpeg"><br><a name="habracut"></a>

      According to AdvoCam, the updated AdvoCam-FD8 Red II (GPS + GLONASS) is the most thoughtful video recorder of the middle price segment (8-12 thousand rubles) in Russia at the end of 2016.  In this case, ‚Äúreasonableness‚Äù means Super HD shooting, a GLONASS / GPS receiver, HDMI, internal memory, a large screen and other useful features in a compact package.  Well, let's understand how successful was the update of the popular model. <br><br><h2>  Equipment </h2><br>  AdvoCam-FD RED-II GPS + GLONASS is notable for a rather rich package.  So, besides the registrar, the following accessories were put in the box. <br><br>  1. Cigarette lighter charger with optional USB port.  Thus, through the adapter, you can charge not only the autoreg, but also a smartphone or tablet. <br>  2. Convenient mounting on the vacuum suction cup. <br>  3. Plastic hooks on 3M adhesive tape for neat cable routing around the car (only 6 hooks, which is enough even for a bus or a truck). <br>  4. Cable for connecting the recorder to a computer (USB-microUSB). <br>  5. User Guide. <br>  6. Disk with software.  There you will find instructions in electronic form, as well as a player for viewing videos and codecs.  However, the manual is on the site AdvoCam.  This is important, since CD drives today are not available on all laptops or even desktop computers. <br>  7. Information sheet from the president of the board of legal protection of motorists and the popular TV and radio host Viktor Travin.  This brochure lists the actions you need to do with video recording in the event of an accident.  Information is useful, it is difficult to deny. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c46/37d/c76/c4637dc7691b4961a055808787e854ad.jpeg"><br><br>  All of the above is packaged in a rectangular box made of cardboard.  Packaging is decorated in red and black colors.  In addition to the image of the AdvoCam-FD8 RED-II GPS + GLONASS itself, the value of the device control keys is indicated on the box.  Here you can find the main characteristics of the recorder.  There is also a table of the ratio of the amount of memory cards and the length of the video that fits on these cards. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/dce/d9a/fac/dced9afacb0b4d508b1f97861b9e259d.jpeg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/4e9/668/0d4/4e96680d4d6a45299166a77e2a6623d7.jpeg"><br><br><h2>  Design and controls </h2><br>  AdvoCam-FD8 RED-II GPS + GLONASS looks almost the same as all other models of the FD8 line - Black and Gold of this brand.  All of them are made in one design: a body elongated in a horizontal plane, rounded corners and beveled edges.  The only difference is in the color of the plastic lining around the camera lens, in our case it is red.  As it is clear from the name of the device. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/9df/f3a/6f7/9dff3a6f717447a6afd5ddebfb1c29b7.jpeg"><br><br>  In addition to the aforementioned lens and red insert, on the front side of the device (that is, the one that looks at the road) are the slots of the speaker, as well as the LED backlight.  The latter should not be used in motion, as its light will be reflected from the windshield, which will significantly degrade the quality of the video.  This light is needed to illuminate nearby objects when the car is standing.  For example, with its help on the record you will see the face of the traffic police inspector who came up for a conversation or, God forbid, an attempt to sell you his striped wand.  Also on this side of the AdvoCam-FD8 RED-II GPS + GLONASS, we see the AdvoCam logo and an indication that the device is recording video in Super Full HD 1296p. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/7b8/7b5/766/7b87b576695d4897b79ce39a87a47910.jpeg"><br><br>  On the opposite side of the recorder is a large 2.7-inch display.  Such a diagonal is enough for studying the menu, and for aiming the camera on the road, and even for watching the recorded video.  On each side of the screen AdvoCam-FD8 RED-II GPS + GLONASS are located the control buttons - one double key on the left and right.  By the way, about management: this device (as in all other AdvoCam models) has a proprietary OneTouch interface that allows you to enable or disable one or another function (turn on / off the screen, record sound, light, and much more) with one click.  It is actually convenient and very easy to learn.  I note that even a beginner will not have difficulty managing AdvoCam-FD RED-II GPS + GLONASS. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ee1/997/8f3/ee19978f36444f6687e47187d11052d5.jpeg"><br><br>  On the upper side of the AdvoCam-FD8 RED-II GPS + GLONASS there are two more control keys: power and instant photo.  There is also a connector for connecting to a computer and an AV output.  In addition, at the upper end is a contact area for the mounting bracket.  Yes, the power to the AdvoCam-FD8 RED-II GPS + GLONASS is supplied through the mounting bracket, and not directly.  That is, the cable of the charger is not connected to the recorder, but to the mount (although you can ‚Äústick‚Äù in the case).  This design allows you to quickly remove or install the autoreg on the glass - and no fuss with the wires. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/18d/382/6e9/18d3826e94a3497c9aec64a947c1dc75.jpeg"><br><br>  At the bottom of the recorder there are only vents, there is nothing more here. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/bb1/f1d/255/bb1f1d255233469d805de059af220cc1.jpeg"><br><br>  On the right side of the AdvoCam-FD8 RED-II GPS + GLONASS (as viewed from the screen) there is a slot for a MicroSD memory card.  The gadget easily recognizes cards up to 128 GB inclusive.  About 16 hours of video in Super Full HD format or a day of continuous shooting in Full HD will fit on a USB flash drive of this size.  Thus, you can capture even a very long trip entirely. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/723/f76/d4e/723f76d4e6b94ea0bbd712f5234acfa2.jpeg"><br><br>  On the left side there is a reset button (reset) and a miniHDMI output recessed into the case.  The latter is used to connect the recorder to the TV. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/fa3/9bd/c51/fa39bdc51d4546a5b06544d2859f518c.jpeg"><br><br>  The body of the AdvoCam-FD8 RED-II GPS + GLONASS is made of black rough plastic.  The material is pleasant to the touch and quite practical.  So, it does not leave fingerprints or minor scratches on it, it is not prone to collecting scuffs, and does not slip out of his hand.  I have no complaints about the quality of the assembly of the recorder.  All parts are clearly fitted to each other, there are no uneven joints, no burrs, or large gaps. <br><br>  Here I will say a few words about the mounting on the vacuum suction cup.  As I said, the power cable is not connected to the recorder, but to the mount.  It also has the advantage of compact dimensions and a reliable swivel joint.  In other words, you can quickly turn the recorder in any direction without unscrewing the screws and pushing the clips.  For example, in the salon or in the direction of the driver's window to record a conversation with the traffic police inspector. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/522/dd7/8e8/522dd78e8c0b4dd1b84596f851f12c14.jpeg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/8f2/588/5de/8f25885debd74132852735057b4e1cfc.jpeg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/34f/06b/5a2/34f06b5a2c36493aa0ef2e4642bec5cf.jpeg"><br><br><h2>  <b>Video recording</b> </h2><br>  AdvoCam-FD8 RED-II GPS + GLONASS records video in resolution - Super Full HD (2304x1296 pixels).  Therefore, it is foolish to assume that it uses cheap plastic lenses, a Chinese processor and a Chinese matrix.  With such savings, many brands that produce relatively inexpensive recorders sin, but AdvoCam is not one of them. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/6a8/d24/1a8/6a8d241a840649759768d3213327131d.jpeg"><br><br>  So, the AdvoCam-FD8 RED-II GPS + GLONASS lens consists of six lenses made from coated professional glass.  This suggests that the matrix receives a greater amount of light in comparison with plastic lenses;  as a result, the evening and night videos are of a higher quality.  In addition, plastic lenses can deform over time under the influence of temperature drops, and this will not happen with glass. <br><br>  The viewing angle of the lens is 120 degrees diagonally.  So not only what happens right in front of the hood of the car, but also the side of the road gets into the frame.  At the same time, the image remains ‚Äúsmooth‚Äù, that is, it is not bent at the edges, as is the case with wide-angle lenses. <br><br>  On the processor for AdvoCam-FD8 RED-II GPS + GLONASS also did not save.  This is the top version of the American Ambarella - A7LA50.  The matrix here is also American - 4-megapixel OmniVision OV4689 format 1/3 ".  That is, the size of the sensor is larger here than in most other recorders, where it is usually 1/4 ‚Äùor even smaller.  This has a very positive effect on the quality of the recording in low light conditions, since the larger each pixel of the matrix, the better the night and evening video will be.  And all this - especially emphasize - in the registrar of the middle class, and not in the flagship model! <br><br>  AdvoCam-FD8 RED-II GPS + GLONASS records video in the following modes: <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ 2560 x 1080 pixels, 30 frames per second; <br>  ‚Ä¢ 2304 x 1296 pixels, 30 frames per second; <br>  ‚Ä¢ 1920 x 1080 pixels, 30 frames per second; <br>  ‚Ä¢ 1920 x 1080 pixels with HDR, 30 frames per second; <br>  ‚Ä¢ 1280 x 720 pixels, 60 frames per second; <br>  ‚Ä¢ 1280 x 720 pixels, 30 frames per second. <br><br>  I suggest to get acquainted with examples of video recorded on AdvoCam-FD8 RED-II GPS + GLONASS at different times of the day and under different weather conditions: <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/T766YXPBiJM" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fhZ-94assiY" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VX-caVbxRs8" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/60Hlw66A5gs" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d9e/16b/355/d9e16b355f914a8491640b60cf6be8ad.jpeg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/487/2af/495/4872af49551f4dbaa16cb4970a1ad3b7.jpeg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/2c3/14d/14e/2c314d14e8c44edb8b49e02ef641c611.jpeg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e91/392/a66/e91392a6644c4150b56e5dbb2d703551.jpeg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/cc1/f0e/5e9/cc1f0e5e9efd47c98e55e2c5712f025a.jpeg"><br><br>  I‚Äôm not a bit misleading if I say that AdvoCam-FD8 RED-II GPS + GLONASS writes high-quality video.  The records show all the small details, such as traffic signs, the color of traffic lights, car license plates, texts on road signs and so on.  Also note the absence of dark areas in the frame and unnecessarily lightened - the picture is flat. <br><br>  All of the above applies to both day and night shooting.  I can not believe that AdvoCam-FD RED-II GPS + GLONASS belongs to the middle class of autoregs.  In the afternoon, the readability of state numbers is about 17-18 meters, at night - up to 12 meters.  These are excellent indicators for a model of an average price range with a price tag of less than 10 thousand rubles.  Chinese competitors for the same money give worse performance: during the day - a maximum of 15 meters, at night - about 10 meters. <br><br><h2>  <b>Additional functions</b> </h2><br>  Here I start with the fact that AdvoCam-FD8 RED-II GPS + GLONASS automatically turns on and starts recording after starting the engine of the car.  Shutdown occurs in a similar way - the engine was muffled, shooting stopped and the recorder turned off.  You can also activate the manual start / stop recording.  The loop recording function (saving new clips over old ones when the memory card is full) is, of course, present.  In the settings you can choose the duration of the rollers between 1, 5, 10 and 15 minutes. <br><br>  In order for an important video not to be accidentally deleted during a loop recording, any fragment can be marked as ‚Äúimportant‚Äù and ‚Äúundeletable‚Äù manually.  A built-in G-sensor is also provided for assigning an emergency tag, which automatically responds to ‚Äúemergency situations‚Äù, for example, a blow, sudden braking, hitting an open hatch, a large pit, etc.  In this case, the sensor works and automatically protects the current fragment of the video from being overwritten.  By the way, in the settings you can adjust the sensitivity of the G-sensor.  Let's say you often drive on dirt roads or roads with poor coverage - you need to set the sensitivity to a lower level so that the sensor does not work on the smallest holes and bumps.  And vice versa: if you ride only on good roads, we ‚Äútwist‚Äù the sensitivity to a higher level. <br><br>  Separately, I note the function "copy for the protocol."  With its help, you can quickly copy the ‚Äúemergency‚Äù video into the recorder's memory (256 MB of internal memory is provided for this, which is enough for almost two minutes of recording in Super Full HD resolution), and pull out the memory card and give it to the traffic police officer.  Agree, it is convenient.  You do not need to copy the video to your phone or equip the recorder with a second memory card slot.  I really liked this option. <br><br>  Many features in the AdvoCam-FD8 RED-II GPS + GLONASS add a two-system GPS / GLONASS satellite navigation receiver. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/500/49a/228/50049a2287df4b1dbb480fb4f886bcae.jpeg"><br><br>  For example, it defines the speed that can be displayed on top of a video sequence in the form of a stamp.  In addition, in the settings you can set the maximum speed limit, which will be shown in the video.  So to say, an option specifically for drivers of our country who like to break the speed limit.  In addition, AdvoCam-FD8 RED-II GPS + GLONASS is able to warn the driver in advance about approaching traffic police posts, speed cameras (including the Strelka-ST), etc.  That is, in case of exceeding, you always have time to reduce the speed to the allowed.  It works as follows.  In the memory of the recorder contains a database with the coordinates of posts and cameras.  When approaching such points, the device will alert you with a sound signal, and your current speed and allowed speed will be shown on the screen.  You can use it as an ‚Äúofficial‚Äù database from AdvoCam (available on the official website of the <a href="http://advocam.ru/bazy-koordinat/">brand</a> ) or use the bases from enthusiasts (there are more than enough on the Internet).  In addition, you yourself can edit the file with the database - delete outdated "points" or add your own.  Everything is simple and convenient, the file has the extension TXT. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/65d/a05/070/65da050705af46918e4366d30c904b7f.jpeg"><br><br>  If someone does not know, than the two-system satellite navigation module is better than the usual GPS (single-system), I will explain.  The GLONASS / GPS option is more confident in communicating with satellites in poor signal reception conditions, such as tunnels or places with a large number of tall buildings.  Plus, the search for satellites, that is, the start of the navigation module takes less time.  AdvoCam is one of the few recorder manufacturers that equips its models with dual-system GPS-GLONASS receivers.  Chinese and pseudo-Russian brands, which resell ‚ÄúChina‚Äù under their logos, almost always put a ‚Äúbare‚Äù GPS and do not take into account national specifics for Russian consumers. <br><br>  It is also worth mentioning the availability of the LDWS security system in AdvoCam-FD8 RED-II GPS + GLONASS, the function of which is to reduce the number of accidents caused by a driver who is asleep or distracted.  So, the recorder monitors the movement of the car on the road lane and in the case of a shift to the side of the road or to the next lane, it emits a loud signal.  Thus, the driver will have time to recover and avoid accidents.  The function is very useful, only for its proper operation you need high-quality road markings, not covered with dust, dirt or snow.  That is, this function will work as a matter of fact only in summer in good weather. <br><br><h2>  <b>Conclusion</b> </h2><br>  To summarize.  AdvoCam-FD8 RED-II GPS + GLONASS belongs to the middle class of DVRs, but its membership determines only the price (9,500 rubles).  Otherwise, it is quite possible to call it the flagship device, and for this there is every reason.  Judge for yourself: the recorder writes a highly detailed, high-quality video in Super Full HD resolution, for which it is worth thanking expensive components.  The numbers of cars driving in front are distinguishable during the day from 17 meters, at night - from 12. Very, very worthy result for the average price segment.  It is also equipped with a dual-system satellite communications module (GPS / GLONASS), unlike most Chinese models, which only include GPS.  AdvoCam-FD8 RED-II GPS + GLONASS has a very wide range of additional functions - almost the maximum.  Including warning of approaching radar, cameras and traffic police posts, and the increasingly popular LDWS system.  Add here a high build quality and rich equipment.  As a result, we get a modern car for an affordable price.  However, if you want to save a little - you can buy the AdvoCam-FD8 RED-II version for 8,000 rubles without the GPS / GLONASS module. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/370019/">https://habr.com/ru/post/370019/</a></p>
