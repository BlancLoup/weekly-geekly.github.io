  <section class="page js-page"><h1>On the problem of choosing a specialty and university ...</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Just a week ago, I received another newsletter from Bounty Hunters (hh.ru) ... and maybe, as usual, I would send it to the scrap, but my attention was drawn to one interesting headline: <i><b><a href="">Do Russians feel sorry about their education?</a></b></i> <br><br>  What is interesting for me personally this topic?  Probably everyone) Quite recently having graduated from a large Siberian university and having worked there for a year as a teacher ... I notice more and more often that most students come to university not to study, but simply because it is prestigious, cool, it gives "opportunities" ... <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Teaching quite difficult disciplines (programming and others like them) in a profile specialty that I successfully graduated a couple of years ago ... every year I meet guys who are not only unable to get on the budget, but are also willing to pay 50 thousand a year, realizing that they can learn they will be incredibly difficult at the specialty and that they definitely cannot work in their specialty.  Many of my friends when choosing a specialty were guided not by their own abilities, inclinations, chtoli talent ... but by what is fashionable, it sounds beautiful, the university is quoted ... <br><br>  Maybe I‚Äôm not quite right, but IMHO earning a lot of money depends little on the choice of university steepness and the inscription in the diploma) One friend of mine left the first year ... went to the construction site ... worked as an electrician (unofficially of course) for 40 thousand a month ... I think that for Kemerovo with an average salary of 15, this is not bad ... I worked for six months and went as a loader for 20-25 to work ... and this is without diplomas and all sorts of knowledge) It's funny.

      Returning to the figures published in the article, I will say ... the numbers are not far from the truth ... I have been disaccustomed for 5 years and who have not seen: smart, stupid, cunning, nerds, talented ... But in the specialty they go to work consciously (clearly representing why and where they are going) 20 percent each stream ... the rest go where they take. <br><br>  It is very very strange ... WHY do people spend 5 years of their lives, and many still pay pretty good money for this spending?  Why not choose an interesting specialty and become a professional? <br><br>  I think that if in the near future people ... young people ... do not begin to think with their heads, then the percentages of those who are not satisfied with their specialty, those who have never worked in the specialty, those who are retrained will steadily grow. <br><br>  ZY: somehow my first post on Habr√© emotionally turned out ... probably it was painful ... somehow I felt uncomfortable in the same group with people who were aimlessly killing time ... I would like to have more purposeful, active and far-sighted people around me) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/71580/">https://habr.com/ru/post/71580/</a></p>
