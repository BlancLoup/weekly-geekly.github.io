Good watch with a sim card</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  No wonder that representatives of shops from Aliexpress are reading Geektimes, but it was a little unexpected to get an offer to write a few words about the watch, because we just write the least about watches. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/g5/_y/z5/g5_yz5nmuiwhtyo6ejl_at1yaru.jpeg"><br><br>  The clock on the pictures seemed quite curious, and it is quite possible that someone needs just such simple ‚Äúsmart watch‚Äù. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The company that sells this watch mainly <a href="https://flovemes.ru.aliexpress.com/store/511717">specializes</a> in accessories for smartphones, cases, portable docking stations, cables, etc., having several stores in its arsenal.

      In one of them, and sold a model with the modest name " <a href="https://ru.aliexpress.com/store/product/FLOVEME-Smart-Watch-LCD-Camera-Android-Bluetooth-Smartwatch-SIM-Card-Men-Women-Wristwatch-For-Samsung-Sony/511717_32686093836.html">Smart Watch</a> ".  As usual, China in the pictures seemed quite impressive: they do something, and they know how to issue cards for goods, and all the images are really captivating. <br><br>  <b>In short</b> <br><br>  The clock is, in fact, a small phone where you can insert your Sim with 3G support.  Probably, in connection with this, and the battery, as in the good old Nokia, is removable, and under it is a connector. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/vl/mo/fh/vlmofh5cy4ast_lcycswnzn2-gc.jpeg"><br><br>  Frankly, there are now so many ways to connect with a person that the value of a second smartphone is questionable, however, some still use a second SIM card for work.  As a second smartphone, of course, the watch is equipped with a speaker and a microphone. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/kx/av/hi/kxavhiwrbu3gdjcu_benca49nsm.jpeg"><br><br>  The speaker is full of voices, but to communicate, you will have to bring the microphone closer to your lips for better call quality.  Actually, in this watch is not very different from the phone, where, in general, the microphone is also brought to the lips. <br><br><blockquote>  As a result, you have on your wrist a simple little talker that will make room in your pocket, <br>  removing the second phone from there.  Quite a compromise solution, however, is probably still in demand. </blockquote><br>  <b>Bluetooth watch</b> <br><br>  Smart watch is the second possibility of this model.  By ‚Äúsmart watch‚Äù, we understand the classic ability to synchronize with a smartphone in order to receive notifications from the main smartphone. <br><br>  This is perhaps the most understandable and correct way to operate this model, where calls are also available, listening to music from the phone‚Äôs memory, etc. What is important to note right away is that the clock supports Russian, so notifications will come in normal encoding. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/e-/3v/c-/e-3vc-7zoggj_wsqje-maecosio.jpeg"><br><br>  The clock connects to the smartphone via Bluetooth, not Bluetooth-smart, and this means that they act as if in a headset, that is, in pairing mode with a smartphone, neither to the watch nor to the smartphone, say, you don‚Äôt connect a headset anymore baffling.  Calls that you make in Bluetooth mode will be transmitted by speakerphone through the clock speaker when dialing a number from the main SIM card of the smartphone. <br><br>  Also with music.  Moving to the appropriate section of the menu on the clock and selecting "Bluetooth Music", you will hear your playlist through the speaker of the wearable device. <br><br><blockquote>  As a result, you have a Bluetooth-headset on your wrist that can activate some functions of the smartphone and provide quick access to them, as well as display notifications from the main device in Russian. </blockquote><br>  <b>Menu</b> <br><br>  The watch has a single button that turns the device on and off, and everything else is available in ‚Äútouch mode‚Äù.  With your fingers, you can switch between multiple screensavers with dials. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/eg/jd/3d/egjd3dbxneqfagailrkws4eh4cs.jpeg"><br><br>  And also work from the main menu in the device, where you can set up a language, use a calculator, set a stopwatch, and so on, and similar functions that are available to simple android smartphones. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/wg/fa/gp/wgfagp4wspb6rlvrvhfrlyojdfc.jpeg"><br><br>  The main screen after the splash screen looks like this. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/nk/58/uy/nk58uy16yyr_vqp6kzpsw8jc3cs.jpeg"><br><br>  As you can pay attention, the clock supports the Russian language not only for notifications, but also for the operating system as a whole, so there should be no difficulties in adjusting and optimizing the device. <br><br>  The clock menu has a section with a QR code, which, when scanned, sends you to Apk with the application.  Yes, the watch has its own proprietary software. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/qs/ph/ow/qsphowr1wqzxv2wt1hhyzq3ptmm.jpeg"><br><br>  There are several options for setting up notifications, the main one of which is, in fact, the choice of applications from which you want to receive "pushes".  Again, it's nice that the application is localized. <br><br>  For those who will use the clock and as a pedometer and calorie counter, there are also several sections with statistics on activity and sleep. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/oo/1b/qd/oo1bqd2v85zsnlo3zbfnmmlyxp0.jpeg"><br><br><blockquote>  As a result, your smartphone has a small and uncomplicated, Russified assistant, thanks to which you can monitor activity and open notifications to applications. </blockquote><br>  <b>Why Apple Watch?</b> <br><br>  The design of the device is close enough to the most important clock.  In general, you probably don‚Äôt need to intentionally make a watch unlike Apple Watch: the apple gadget is cool, sold, popular, why not be equal to the leader? <br><br>  When we first saw the photo on Aliexpress, it became interesting, but is it really so, so they even requested a photo from the seller. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/bt/xt/wl/btxtwlljs2eaca4gxmwnu-iwb-4.jpeg"><br><br>  Well, really, it seems?  However, the stuffing here is much simpler: we will not get a heart rate monitor or GPS.  The watches are based on Qualcomm MTK6260A, have a resolution of 240x240 and a 1.54 "LED display. <br><br>  And, perhaps, the only thing that still unites, apart from the rather attractive design of this model with the Apple Watch model, is autonomy.  Chinese watches come with a 300 mAh battery, which lasts a couple of days.  It feels like several complete discharges / charges did their job and the watch began to work a little longer than immediately out of the box. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/wk/ln/3h/wkln3hauvw76vc0o2l5fdmxbrwi.jpeg"><br><br>  The truth here is to say that the advantage is that its branded docking station, which you need to have on hand, is not, and the model is charging from MicroUSB, which means you can ‚Äúcorrect‚Äù the charge situation at least from the PowerBank on the road. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/qi/cu/u9/qicuu9cy9ryw64xx0evaepr5e68.jpeg"><br><br>  The connector is located on the same side where the speaker and microphone, exactly between them. <br><br><blockquote>  As a result, you have a visually attractive accessory on your wrist, comfortable enough for wearing because of a soft silicone strap that does not cut into your hand. <br>  The straps, despite the fastening design, are still non-removable. </blockquote><br>  <b>Spy things</b> <br><br>  Despite the fact that, as we have said, there is one active button here, you have already noticed two ‚Äúeye-catching parts‚Äù on one side of the case. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/eh/ka/ld/ehkaldrght6oaxxvcx8im5n2v0s.jpeg"><br><br>  And, probably, they have already seen that the crown here serves as a camouflaged camera.  Let's say at once that we do not understand why this is necessary.  First, such an arrangement of the camera makes it at least somewhat suitable only for those who wear a watch on the left hand, and secondly, 0.3 megapixels - well, so-so wealth. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/cg/zo/ks/cgzoksxiexgesdhov67eq9wtygs.jpeg"><br><br>  Nevertheless, the camera is working, and there is even a zoom, and the pictures can be transferred to a computer using the same MicroUSB: the device will be defined as a removable disk. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Photos from the clock</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/xi/xn/yh/xixnyhhidgackqpqvfodcuwshjm.jpeg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/lz/42/tc/lz42tcoc_kkpwdzuafqznqgoddy.jpeg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/uq/aj/vd/uqajvdbpsd_dxmzdyqjd_f8vrje.jpeg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/_2/o8/js/_2o8jsstvl9j3rslr84f2z9x-08.jpeg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/l_/kv/ll/l_kvllvowaojyncug8m_vhngnw8.jpeg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/xd/i5/vq/xdi5vqiw7x1bxlci06ojmadvc3s.jpeg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ni/vr/3n/nivr3napd6tsaptyvf_ws4sm9uc.jpeg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/dd/-l/1-/dd-l1-yqs5tld5wdpc-s4tabpak.jpeg"><br></div></div><br>  Watches are delivered in a compact box, nice proportional look. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/xf/ff/yz/xfffyzdjd_igmymwwr6ykzw4a_k.jpeg"><br><br>  And inside there is even a welcome message in Russian. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/pq/ia/ud/pqiaud94h6hviiypfila84t9-do.jpeg"><br><br>  In general, everything is not bad, if you do not expect something supernatural from watches worth up to 2,000 rubles.  They are not bad tailored, no negligence in the design is not noticed.  Looks all neat. <br><br>  If we consider them not as watches up to 2,000 rubles, but as a smartphone on the wrist up to 2,000 rubles, it seems that this could also increase their value in the eyes of potential buyers.  Low autonomy in the background of all other models of smart watches with built-in battery does not look blatant.  It is clear that Chinese developers do not invent, but copy, or ‚Äúquote‚Äù, so it‚Äôs not necessary to expect something innovative.  It‚Äôs just a cheap watch with smartphone and Bluetooth 3.0 features. <br><br>  They are <a href="https://ru.aliexpress.com/store/product/FLOVEME-Smart-Watch-LCD-Camera-Android-Bluetooth-Smartwatch-SIM-Card-Men-Women-Wristwatch-For-Samsung-Sony/511717_32686093836.html">inexpensive</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/370971/">https://habr.com/ru/post/370971/</a></p>
