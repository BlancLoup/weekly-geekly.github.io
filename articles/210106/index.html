Or why we do not go to the clouds</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The reason for writing this article was <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/209450/">this post</a> , telling that in the very near future, most small and medium-sized businesses will move from ‚Äúa whole department with incomprehensible people who need to be registered, pay salaries, provide workplace, plus a dedicated server room , with air conditioning, racks, servers, consuming electricity at the speed of a huge iron that never turns off "to" a man in a suit who comes at the end of each month with a bottle of French brandy and a bill  m for IT services. " <br><br>  Under the cut thinking about what can and cannot be transferred to the clouds on the example of a real enterprise. <br><h6>  <i>Caution: there are no pictures and not much text</i> </h6><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h5>  Small introduction </h5><br>  I work at a distillery with five production lines.  From IT equipment, a little more than a hundred workplaces, a dozen servers, some specific equipment, a sea of ‚Äã‚Äãtwisted pair, a pair of fiber optic cables and an awesome wide Internet channel of 4Mbps (we plan to increase it to 10Mbps) <br><br>  At the time of my employment, there were almost two times fewer workstations, one server and two non-servers (the Internet gateway and file manager on ubuntu 12.04 without raid) and the complete lack of documentation of something, and even without a domain.  On a single server spun 1C.

      The IT department consists of, in fact, two people: me (head of department + 1C administrator) and system administrator (whom you can‚Äôt find how - 4 people changed in half a year) <br><br><h6>  Content </h6><br>  It is no secret that IT is a cost that affects the cost, and therefore the competitiveness / profitability of the enterprise.  Let's try to cut them and give them to feed to an external cloud. <br>  Will consider in this order: <br><ul><li>  Server </li><li>  Workstations </li><li>  Specialist.  equipment </li><li>  Staff </li></ul><br><br>  <b>Server</b> <br><ul><li>  Internet gateway with billing and courtesans - not translated, otherwise there will simply not be the very Internet to connect to the cloud </li><li>  Print server (for managing the print queue + driver storage) - stupid to translate - a waste of the Internet channel, but additional delays </li><li>  Server 1C is theoretically possible, but accessibility is critical for it, and this will not allow the existing Internet channel </li><li>  Surveillance servers - traffic from 50 ip cameras through 4 megabits?  Are you seriously? </li><li>  File server - with the Internet, it will lose all meaning </li><li>  Domain controller and backup controller - to outsource spit on information security?  well, I do not </li></ul><br><br>  <b>With workstations, it is</b> somewhat more interesting - you can put RDP or Hyper-V clients, but firstly the capacities of most machines are not far from such equipment, and again the Internet channel will not allow keeping the cloud server of workstations virtualization. <br><br>  <b>At the expense of special equipment,</b> everything is simple - it is impossible.  Neither the EGAIS server and workstations, nor the blend servers and controllers, nor computerized alcohol and bottle counters on the lines, nor machines with various sensors connected.  This hardware and software is not adapted to cloud computing in any way; moreover, in most hardware and software specifications, black and white print and blue print is prohibited.  And nothing else. <br><br>  So quickly we came to the main problem (well, I don‚Äôt know how to pour water and compose long posts) - the <b>staff</b> .  Even if you forget about all of the above, and send everything to the cloud with your admins, you still need 2 IT specialists.  As it is not regrettable, but the main work of the system administrator is to turn on the printers, correctly insert the paper tray, install the cartridges, press ‚Äúok‚Äù on warning messages, turn off the Caps Lock mode and other nonsense.  I, as the administrator of 1C, basically make sure that the accountants do not put crutches, that the data do not diverge from the actual and ongoing training of employees, because out of 80+ users of 1C, about 60 saw it for the first time only in our eyes.  If we remove the history of Bash from our work, then one person would be enough for half the rate, but this is the harsh truth of life. <br><br><h5>  Total </h5><br>  The main problems for general virtualization and cloudization (crooked word - just leave it here) are: <br><ul><li>  lack of broadband and stable Internet access, except for big cities </li><li>  computing and resource requirements for client equipment are small enough, which makes senseless transfer to virtualization </li><li>  Some "retardation" of developers of specialized software regarding new technologies, most likely associated with testing and ensuring maximum reliability </li><li>  The almost complete lack of "computer literacy" of employees of other services </li></ul><br>  The article <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/donjenya/" class="user_link">donjenya is</a> relevant, in my opinion, only for megacities and companies providing services, and not engaged in production - it is not very soon cloud computing will be able to "capture" manufacturing enterprises of the outback. <br><br>  <b>PS</b> Depth = 200km from the center of Moscow.  There is no internet connection outside Moscow Ring Road </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/210106/">https://habr.com/ru/post/210106/</a></p>
