I am for you!</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Remember this advertising technique when the advertised product asks the consumer who I am?  So, it is very important to correctly answer this question.  We live in a society of active and thoughtful consumption, therefore, we want to tell about ourselves somehow meaningfully. <br><br>  For example, start an interesting blog on Habr√© to share impressions and discoveries, both with professionals in the field of collective purchases, and with those who just love discounts. <br><br>  Here it is necessary to clarify what kind of product we sell.  The very concept of collective shopping services came to Russia from America.  Let's just say: this is a service that provides discounts from 50 to 97% for visiting cafes and restaurants, entertainment centers and clubs, beauty salons and SPA, training courses, etc.

      In the USA over the last year, the number of companies with a similar concept has grown by as much as 8 times!  The largest ones are Groupon and, LivingSocial.  Just a note: Groupon.com was launched in November 2008 with 400 subscribers.  Now the number of subscribers is already more than 4 million people from 58 cities around the world. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  In Russia, this market was opened by pokupator.ru and zakupator.ru, although their idea was slightly different from KupiKupon - the initiative to search for and select lucrative offers and payment methods had to come exclusively from buyers. <br><br>  <a href="http://kupikupon.ru/">KupiKupon</a> itself appeared recently - on May 1 of this year, but at the moment we already have more than 250,000 active users - will you agree worthy?  Meanwhile, at first in Moscow we were met with suspicion.  Still, people who are ready to deceive are accustomed to be on the alert: fear of being deceived overcame any common sense.  I had to call marketers, SEO, PR, and explain what collective online shopping is, what KupiKupon is and why (and most importantly - to whom!) It is profitable, etc.  After a couple of weeks, people began to look closely and try, after a month to make the first active purchases.  The circle of discount lovers has expanded to other cities of Russia: St. Petersburg, Nizhny Novgorod, Rostov-on-Don, Voronezh, Novosibirsk, Krasnodar, Krasnoyarsk, etc. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/23f6f41a/5c4c39ad/f265af54/1de0fd06.png"></div><br><br>  By the way, we are generally against borders and are aimed at wide expansion in Russia and not only.  If we are not in your city yet, it is only because we have not reached it yet.  Everything will be, we promise.  For this, including, and the blog started, so that you were aware of what we have and how. <br><br>  You, probably, already know that this market is developing very abruptly now, and our colleagues in Russia are already under 40. KupiKupon, whose ideology fits into the pronoun "we", prefers to be friends and unite with competitors.  So we have united with NadoVmeste in the Ural region, because the expansion of geography for us is a priority. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/3edf1a07/8620ed26/2f3cdd6d/64362302.jpg"></div><br><br>  So today the company's shares are available to residents of 15 major cities of Russia, as well as Kazakhstan, Ukraine and Belarus.  In the near future we plan to connect the Baltic countries to the service. <br><br>  Very soon the turn will reach Donetsk, Odessa, Kharkov and Dnepropetrovsk, because the Ukrainian audience is active and has a very positive attitude to such projects.  If about Kazakhstan, then 60% of the total kaznet accounts for only 6 major cities of the republic - Almaty (48%), Astana (8%), Karaganda (6.5%), Pavlodar (5%), Atyrau and Aktobe (2 each). five%).  Geographically, the development of the project here will go just in that order. <br><br>  The good news does not end there, and we plan to keep you informed.  Subscribe to not miss anything, follow our updates on Twitter and Facebook, and if you have questions - ask them in the comments to this post - we will be happy to answer, show and brag. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/106799/">https://habr.com/ru/post/106799/</a></p>
