On some of the existing freelance exchanges, the system of building a rating of specialists is far from being objective, since feedback on the result of the work is not always set by customers: there is a solid exchange of feedback between freelancers, not to mention the fact that reviews can be bought.  As a result, customers often face incompetent specialists, despite the fact that the rating of these specialists is relatively high.  In turn, specialists with sufficient work experience and a high level of professionalism, but not raising their rating for money, find themselves in the lower ranks of the lists, undeservedly remaining unnoticed by employers. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <a href="http://www.prohq.ru/">The remote work exchange PROhq</a> offers its users a system of building an honest rating, which is based on objective indicators, including activity on the site, customer relationships and participation in published projects.  In the aggregate, these criteria become a reflection of the professional and business qualities of each freelancer, which has a significant influence on the decision-making of employers when choosing a specialist to perform a project.  In this case, the contractor does not have the opportunity to raise his rating on a fee basis, respectively, the employer can easily distinguish an experienced specialist from a beginner, and fair competition arises between freelancers. <br><br>  In our article we will share the secrets of how to raise your rank on PROhq.

      The performer's rating is increased each time a specialist takes part in published projects, receives positive feedback after their completion or payment using the PROhq services.  In addition, many other indicators are taken into account when compiling the rating. <br><br>  <b>The main components of the rank of freelancer:</b> <br><ul><li>  <b>Work on the site PROhq</b> </li></ul><br><br><img src="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/3644553/%D0%A1%D1%82%D0%B0%D1%82%D1%8C%D0%B8/%D0%94%D0%BB%D1%8F%20%D1%80%D0%B0%D1%81%D1%81%D1%8B%D0%BB%D0%BA%D0%B8/activnost_.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  This indicator is indexed and updated by the PROhq exchange every week, reflecting the freelancer's experience in using the tools of the exchange and its loyalty to other users.  The activity on the site also includes the income of the freelancer, obtained using such tools as ‚ÄúSecure Transaction‚Äù and ‚ÄúDirect Payment‚Äù, the total number of completed projects published on the exchange, and feedback received from customers.  Fines are negatively affecting the activity indicator, which are assigned to the user by the exchange administrator for violating the service rules described in the user agreement. <br><br>  One of the innovative criteria taken into account is the income level of a freelancer.  Legally working freelancers will eventually be able to demonstrate the size of their fees.  On the one hand, it will allow to adequately assess the level of freelancer.  On the other hand, it will simplify the choice of the contractor for your project to the customer.  This indicator is one of the main in the developed English-speaking market, being an objective indicator of everything, and qualifications and business skills. <br><ul><li>  <b>Customer relationship</b> </li></ul><br><br><img src="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/3644553/%D0%A1%D1%82%D0%B0%D1%82%D1%8C%D0%B8/%D0%94%D0%BB%D1%8F%20%D1%80%D0%B0%D1%81%D1%81%D1%8B%D0%BB%D0%BA%D0%B8/vz_klint.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  This indicator is also updated every week and displays the level of quality customer relationships and the overall level of service freelancer.  The indicator is based on recommendations that are provided by the customer to the contractor after the project is completed.  It also includes such characteristics as the average income from clients, obtained using the payment instruments of the exchange, the number of clients and the number of clients who applied to a specialist again. <br><ul><li>  <b>Marketing</b> </li></ul><br><br><img src="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/3644553/%D0%A1%D1%82%D0%B0%D1%82%D1%8C%D0%B8/%D0%94%D0%BB%D1%8F%20%D1%80%D0%B0%D1%81%D1%81%D1%8B%D0%BB%D0%BA%D0%B8/marketing_.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  It is updated weekly and reflects the quality and quantity of information about the freelancer.  It takes into account the completeness of the information that is presented about the specialist on the PROhq exchange, the quality and size of the portfolio, as well as the user's loyalty to the anti-dumping policy of the PROhq.  In addition, marketing is based on such indicators as the number of specialist invitations for project candidates, the number of skills that the freelancer confirmed using official PROhq documents and tests, and the number of exchange users who joined the freelancer partner network. <br><br><img src="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/3644553/%D0%A1%D1%82%D0%B0%D1%82%D1%8C%D0%B8/%D0%94%D0%BB%D1%8F%20%D1%80%D0%B0%D1%81%D1%81%D1%8B%D0%BB%D0%BA%D0%B8/lift_up.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The rank of freelancer is displayed in his profile, where customers can familiarize themselves with it, getting from the search. <br><img src="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/3644553/%D0%A1%D1%82%D0%B0%D1%82%D1%8C%D0%B8/%D0%94%D0%BB%D1%8F%20%D1%80%D0%B0%D1%81%D1%81%D1%8B%D0%BB%D0%BA%D0%B8/proj_type.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Selecting a contractor for your project, the customer sees the freelancer rank in the project interface at the competition, where he evaluates the responses received for the project.  Accordingly, the higher your rank, the more noticeable your response. <br><br>  Thus, the overall rating of a freelancer listed on the PROhq remote work exchange is very objective and allows each employer to get the right idea about a particular specialist.  In turn, the freelancer leads a fair fight with competitors, increasing their level of popularity through their own positive characteristics, which gives him the opportunity to stand out in the general list of specialists and attract the attention of the customer.  On PROhq, you can increase each indicator that affects the rank, separately, which will not only improve the rating, but also improve the real quality of services, and this will also affect the income of a freelancer. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/136804/">https://habr.com/ru/post/136804/</a></p>
