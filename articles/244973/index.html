      This book will help you quickly master the basic concepts of the Haskell programming language, its libraries and components, and also lay the foundation for the functional programming paradigm, which is becoming increasingly important in the modern world of software development.  The book offers a design approach to the development of the material, using as a prototype a project to implement an online store.  It covers the Haskell ecosystem and its tools, Cabal project management tools, HUnit and QuickCheck modules for program testing, Scotty framework for developing web applications, Persistent and Esqueleto for database management, and many other components and Haskell libraries. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h4>  About the author: </h4><br>  Alejandro Serano Mena is an ardent supporter of functional programming, he has been using Haskell for personal and commercial projects for more than five years.  He is currently writing his thesis at the University of Utrecht.  His area of ‚Äã‚Äãinterest relates to the development of systems with strict typing and interaction with such systems, for example, through the Haskell language. <br>  He has contributed to a number of open source projects, including Mono and Nemerle.  In 2011, he participated in the Google Summer of Code program, improving the EclipseFP Haskell plug-in for the popular Eclipse development environment.  In 2012, he and two friends founded the company Nublic, whose activities are focused on providing cloud tools for home environments.  The main part of the software for this project was created using the Scala language, which combines object-oriented and functional aspects. <br>  Alejandro received a diploma in computer science and mathematics from his native University of Madrid.  During his studies, he actively promoted free software ideas and a functional paradigm among students.  His articles can be found in the Spanish magazine Todo Programaci√≥n. <br><br><h4>  About the science editor: </h4><br>  Jean-Philippe Mauresmo has been writing programs for fifteen years.  He has been creating web applications since 1996 and has always had an interest in integrated development environments and language analysis. <br>  He is actively involved in the Haskell open source application development community and is also part of the EclipseFP project support team.  His blog is located at <a href="http://jpmoresmau.blogspot.com/">jpmoresmau.blogspot.com</a> .  J.-F.  Mauresmo with his wife and two children lives in the south of France. <br><br><h4>  Why do you need this book </h4><br>  This book focuses on both the ideas behind the Haskell programming and its practical aspects.  It shows how functional programming concepts are applied in real-world scenarios.  Here you will learn how to work with utilities and libraries provided by Haskell for solving specific problems.  However, not only those new to functional programming will benefit from reading this book.  Developers who write in Scala, Clojure, Lisp, or ML can figure out what makes Haskell different from other programming languages. <br>  The material of the book is based on the project to create a storefront online store.  The five parts of this book describe all the subsystems of the store: the presentation of customers and products in memory, data acquisition (using parallel and simultaneous calculations), persistent storage, discounts and offers, the overall architecture of the application.  Themes have been carefully selected to give you an idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe Haskell ecosystem. <br><br>  Book <a href="http://f.gdeslon.ru/f/ea1cc6296a5b82c7b4041c09b44b616a4e10f72f">on the publisher site</a> <br>  <a href="http://storage.piter.com/upload/contents/978549601188/978549601188_X.pdf">Table of contents</a> <br>  <a href="http://storage.piter.com/upload/contents/978549601188/978549601188_p.pdf">Excerpt</a> <br><br>  For Habra, <b>Haskell</b> coupon discount - 18% </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/244973/">https://habr.com/ru/post/244973/</a></p>
