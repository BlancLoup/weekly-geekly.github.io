  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Raxan, or web programming alone</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  I came to the world of web technologies sometime in 1998.  Admin of the web server, wrote a little on Perl and PHP, but at the same time I was never engaged in web programming professionally - this is how I rather manage several medium projects for myself.  Well, because the admin is bad, he can't figure out the developers‚Äôs jambs and tell me where to fix it.  Again - here you need to admin admin, there is something else ... <br><br>  Then - family, children, time was running out and I fell out of web development.  And when I returned a few years later - my mother, my dear, how things have changed.  Instead of the usual tabular layout - block, and even everything is ambiguous;  instead of single js scripts, Jquery and other frameworks.  The world does not stand still.  There is a problem ... <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  It is good when big studios are engaged in web development, where there is a whole team in each direction.  And if the project is small, then it turns out that a <b>modern single web developer should know 5 languages</b> : something server-based (PHP / Perl / Python etc), SQL, HTML, CSS, and Javascript.  If you are engaged in the development of full-time professionally - probably, it is still possible to remain ‚Äúin line‚Äù in all directions, but if you just need to occasionally write small applications ... I think I'm not alone with this problem.

      The server part is more or less clear: the server part always works in the same way.  But the features of the layout and JS in different browsers and even in different versions of these browsers - this is a stone, about which you can stumble and smash your head, because all this is gained exclusively from your own experience.  ‚ÄúFor chromium, we prescribe such a style, but in IE this tag does not work and you need to write another one instead,‚Äù everyone came across, I guess.  Well, in terms of layout, in simple cases you can use the same Bootstrap, but JS ... <br><br>  As a result, I wondered: why, I ask, in the 21st century I have to write an event handler on JS on my knee, send ajax requests to the server, then a handler of these requests and send responses to PHP (for example), then the processor of these answers again on JS ... break your leg yourself.  And he began to look.  And found. <br><br>  There is such a framework in PHP - <a href="http://raxanpdi.com/"><b>Raxan</b></a> .  According to the functionality of the top frameworks, of course, it doesn‚Äôt suit your eyebrows - work with the database, localization and other goodies from him, frankly, in a very rudimentary state.  But the killer-feature is different: it allows you to work with page elements from PHP.  That is, I can write <b>directly in PHP</b> ‚Äúif a button with id =‚Äù mybutton ‚Äùwas pressed on the page - then put such and such text in a div with id =‚Äù errortext ‚Äù, and make the button inactive‚Äù.  And it will be so.  Moreover, it is precisely in this mode of operation that it is oriented. <br><br>  No samopisny ajax, handlers for you - just a couple of inclides.  Generally not a line of code in JS.  Moreover, this mechanism is easily integrated not only in new projects, but also in existing ones. <br>  I will not <a href="http://raxanpdi.com/sdk/docs/table-of-contents.html">specifically</a> mention here, for those interested, there is <a href="http://raxanpdi.com/sdk/docs/table-of-contents.html">documentation</a> on the site and many <a href="http://raxanpdi.com/sdk/examples/">examples</a> .  From myself I will say that I wrote a couple of intranet web applications on this framework, although I had to suffer. <br><br>  There is only one drawback - the project, alas, stopped its development more than two years ago.  Maybe the mintaire was tired, and maybe something else - but ... not a developing project = a dead project. <br><br>  And here's a snack for a highly respected community: maybe someone knows similar functionality as part of other, more live PHP frameworks?  Or separate libraries?  The idea is beautiful ... </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/191142/">https://habr.com/ru/post/191142/</a></p>
