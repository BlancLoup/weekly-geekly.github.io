  <section class="page js-page"><h1>iPad in United Kingdom May 28</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Approximately 3-4 days before the official sales of the iPad in England, almost all advertising spaces were bought up by everyone's beloved Apple and they showed off their beloved tablet.  Having taken this into service, I decided to go to the Apple Store on May 28 and see for myself what this device is and what the prices are not. <br><br><img src="http://img2.pict.com/fb/14/f6/3567658/0/640/dsc00009.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  (traffic, photo) <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  I arrived at the store at about 8:40 in the morning, but there was already a screw line and people ran one by one (traffic-traffic, hehe).  By the way store in London on Oxford Circus.  When I arrived, I was presented with the following picture shown in the photo.

    <img src="http://img2.pict.com/36/3c/00/3567626/0/640/dsc00007.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  I wanted to get closer to the queue, but they told me that it, the line, starts around the corner.  I purposefully went around the corner and then I saw something similar. <br><br><img src="http://img2.pict.com/cb/28/f0/3567636/0/640/dsc00017.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Having thought hard and realizing how much it will be necessary to stand, I headed to the end of the line.  But here it was not boring, because  Apple employees constantly walked in blue T-shirts labeled with iPad and talked to customers, told about the device's capabilities, what to do with it and what not to do. <br><br><img src="http://img2.pict.com/13/31/8e/3567669/0/640/dsc00019.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  It was also pleasant that not only they sat in my ear, but they also carried free water, it was hot and there were a lot of people who wanted to drink, so the bottles went to pick up. <br><br><img src="http://img2.pict.com/85/9f/cf/3567641/0/640/dsc00020.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  In addition, there were a lot of people with quite serious equipment (video and photo cameras), who now and then photographed and filmed everything that happened.  While standing in line a couple of times people were interviewed, and the questions were mostly like: ‚ÄúHow will you use your new iPad?‚Äù And the answers were almost the same: ‚ÄúI‚Äôll replace my laptop with this great laptop computer.‚Äù  Looking ahead, I will say that many bought the dock for the iPad along with the keyboard.  It turns out now there will be mass replacements of laptops for this miracle of technology. <br><br><img src="http://img2.pict.com/12/f3/16/3567630/0/640/dsc00010.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="http://img2.pict.com/5b/55/f5/3567694/0/640/dsc00021.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  There were posters with the device on the window and it was itself presented for general viewing. <br><br><img src="http://img2.pict.com/d0/13/9a/3567854/0/640/dsc00023.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Approaching the entrance it was clear that there were a lot of people in the store, but not a crowd, although the iPad did not squeeze around the demonstration stand.  Here, at the entrance, a cheerful guy shook his hand to everyone, asked what name they were and if he was happy that he would buy a new computer for himself.  With each new client, Apple employees clapped and shouted at full length, thus welcoming every customer and they continued to do it as I understood from 8 am to 12 pm.  (This is how much energy you need to drink ..) <br><br><img src="http://img2.pict.com/03/ff/61/3567736/0/640/dsc00024.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  When I got to the stands, I saw that one employee spoke into a microphone and clearly showed how and what, and most importantly, where to press to understand the device.  I do not know who listened to it, because everyone looked exactly down - on the table where the tablets were. <br><br><img src="http://img2.pict.com/32/32/3e/3567642/0/640/dsc00027.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  I caught one free consultant and tried to find out whether it was possible to somehow connect a mouse to the device.  In her view it was clear that she had no idea how and what, but she ran to find out from others.  I waited not long, the benefit of the staff was enough.  The answer was one-sided - no, but a number of men said that ‚Äúthis is not yet possible, but the Russians will come up with something‚Äù (he himself was a pure Englishman). <br><br><img src="http://img2.pict.com/88/66/7a/3567645/0/640/dsc00030.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Finally, having waited for one calm and free space, I picked up an iPad for the first time.  The reaction was: "It's nice to hold and it is light."  And then I began to explore all of its capabilities, of which there were many: it supports the Office functions, i.e.  you can make tables, documents, presentations and something else, for each task its own icon (app), also liked the implementation of the calendar (like a real organizer), notebook and iPod applications.  This application is very similar to the iTunes program, so it's very easy to navigate.  The photos were made with a bang, better than in the iPhone, the Book reader is also soundly made, especially as the pages turn over (as in this book).  The graphics of games from the iPhone has not gone far, but ... there is something in it.  The browser is something that I have not yet experienced such a feeling of convenience and comfort.  The implementation of the keys for printing - the tower - you will not miss, and very clearly, remembering how the iPad is lying, I tried the blind printing method.  From 5 sentences one mistake is very good. <br><br><img src="http://img2.pict.com/ab/4a/f7/3567649/0/640/dsc00031.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Now the main question is how much it costs and is it worth it.  Looking at the stand next to it, I saw the prices: <br>  WiFi model <ul><li>  16 GB - ¬£ 429 </li><li>  32 GB - ¬£ 499 </li><li>  64 GB - ¬£ 599 </li></ul>  WiFi + 3G model <ul><li>  16 GB - ¬£ 529 </li><li>  32 GB - ¬£ 599 </li><li>  64 GB - ¬£ 699 </li></ul>  Having made a simple conclusion, we see that in fact for the 3G option we pay extra ¬£ 100.  For me, this is a very good and adequate price, considering that out of the box, the iPad can do almost everything, and what it cannot do is allow. <br><br><img src="http://img2.pict.com/8b/c4/fe/3567648/0/640/dsc00032.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  When I left the press, the press still continued to interview people with white bags (those who bought the iPad).  I really liked the idea with the bag, I feel now there will be such a fashion - who comes with this bag has an iPad.  It's like with white headphones, here Steve Jobs is well suited to this issue. <br><br><img src="http://img2.pict.com/58/6b/ab/3567856/0/640/dsc00011.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  My thoughts remain the same - people want not to add, but to replace their home computers with an iPad.  He can do everything the same as a simple PC.  Here I mean what ordinary people do - watch movies, photographs, use the Internet and check email, as well as create documents, read books, play and much more.  Will I buy this innovation?  I will, but not as a replacement, but as the main tool.  Having understood everything, I realized that I need a laptop only for creating websites.  If someday it will be available on the iPad, then I will sell my laptop at all. <br><br>  <b>UPD:</b> All media materials are already available on a special Lincut account, which was made for the iPad.
