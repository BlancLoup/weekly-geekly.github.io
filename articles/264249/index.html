  <section class="page js-page"><h1>New Hyper-V vNext features</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Greetings, habravchane! <br>  Not so long ago, a new version of Windows Server Technical Preview 2 was released, which more clearly demonstrates the possibilities of a future release of the latest server operating system.  For those directly involved in the operation and development of the IT infrastructure, I have prepared a short note on innovations related to virtualization. <br><br>  Discuss the following topics: <br><ul><li>  Enhance the security of the virtual environment </li><li>  Virtual Machine Configuration </li><li>  Infrastructure Performance Management </li><li>  New Resiliency Features </li><li>  Common virtual disk enhancements </li></ul><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  But first, a few words about Nano Server - a new type of installation of Windows Server Technical Preview 2, which allows you to solve two popular IT tasks: <br><ul><li>  Build a highly reliable IT infrastructure: ensure the implementation of strict SLA, have a long uptime and low OS system requirements; </li><li>  Reduce operating costs by simplifying and reducing the maintenance and management of IT infrastructure. </li></ul><br>  Microsoft promises that the basic installation of Nano Server will require no more than 400 MB of disk space, which is about 20 times less than installing a full-fledged edition of Windows Server.  It is important to note that with such promises Nano Server will retain full support for Windows Server drivers. <br><br>  The Nano Server will be managed through WMI and Core PowerShell, which has a reduced set of cmdlets and limitations related to the absence of .NET.

      Nano Server can be deployed both on a virtualization server and in a virtual machine.  In addition, both methods of creating containers for Windows Server and Hyper-V are supported.  Windows Server Containers is a new feature in Windows Server TP2 that isolates the application runtime in an instance of Windows Server.  Hyper-V containers extend these capabilities in a virtualization environment, which, in this case, eliminates the influence of the guest OS on the operating system of the host or another Hyper-V container. <br><br>  <b>Enhance the security of the virtual environment</b> <br>  Why do companies reluctantly migrate their infrastructure to the public cloud?  I believe that trust in the service provider is the most important selection criterion, followed by the issue of data security. <br><br>  Microsoft worked in this direction and introduced a new Trusted Platform Module (TMP) feature in Hyper-V that allows you to use data encryption in virtual machines.  TPM allows BitLocker to encrypt data, even if the virtual machine is located in a public cloud. <br><br>  Hyper-V in Windows Server TP2 supports the creation of secure virtual machines (Shielded Virtual Machines), the data in which is encrypted and protected from access by system administrators.  This feature is based on the new Host Guardian Service server role, which supports the integrity of a protected server group and controls the data encryption mechanism.  In combination with System Center, new, interesting automation scenarios appear: <br><ul><li>  You can create a new protected virtual machine; convert an existing virtual one into a protected virtual one; </li><li>  You can move protected virtual machines to a private or public cloud and transfer control to external administrators, while ensuring data security; </li><li>  You can create new secured virtual machines from Virtual Machine Manager.  In this case, VMM allows you to track whether the image of the virtual machine template is trusted and consistent at the time of creation; </li><li>  External administrators can migrate protected virtual machines between secure virtualization servers in the same way as before; </li><li>  External administrators can back up and restore protected virtual machines in the same way as before. </li><li>  In addition, for virtual machines with Linux, the Secure Boot feature has appeared, which provides for checking the integrity of the kernel source code at the time of loading the operating system. </li></ul><br>  <b>Virtual Machine Configuration</b> <br>  In Windows Server TP2, a number of typical functions have been updated.  Now, when using them, no need to restart the virtual machine: <br><ul><li>  Resizing and viewing data on the use of RAM in virtual machines for which dynamic memory is not configured; </li><li>  Changing the replication status of new virtual disks without affecting the configuration of Hyper-V Replica for existing disks; </li><li>  Hot add / remove network adapters; </li><li>  Upgrading a Hyper-V cluster from a Windows Server 2012 version with the ability to roll back; </li><li>  View a virtual machine version in a GUI (version 5 for Windows Server 2012, version 6.2 for Windows Server Technical Preview 2) </li><li>  Use Windows Update to update the integration services. </li></ul><br>  <b>Infrastructure Performance Management</b> <br>  I will not hide my joy - finally, in Windows Server TP2, the storage quality management parameters (Storage QoS) appeared.  Now you can not worry about the fact that some kind of virtual machine suddenly ‚Äúslows down‚Äù the storage system. <br><br>  Storage QoS allows you to push IOPS policies for groups of virtual machines that share scalable file storage or CSV.  In the policy, you can set the minimum and maximum IOPS values ‚Äã‚Äãfor the virtual machine. <br><br>  <b>New Resiliency Features</b> <br>  The new features of Virtual Machine Storage Resiliency and Virtual Machine Cluster Resiliency make it possible to secure a virtual machine from unplanned storage system failures, incl.  and CSV. <br><br>  During the period of unavailability of storage systems, Storage Resiliency keeps the virtual machine suspended (suspended).  This feature is similar to Resilient File Handles, which is already present in Windows Server 2012, but at the same time, Storage Resiliency is more reliable, because  allows you to cope with long periods of downtime (Resilient File Handles could provide a suspension for a period of not more than 30 seconds of downtime). <br><br>  The main purpose of the Virtual Machine Cluster Resiliency feature is to avoid unloading the cluster node in the event of a short disconnect.  Instead, the machines continue to work on the disconnected node, and if the connection is restored within 4 minutes, the cluster will continue to work in normal mode.  If a node receives the status of ‚Äúunreliable‚Äù (for example, several periodic failures were recorded), then at the moment of restoring the integrity of the cluster, virtual machines are automatically moved to other nodes, and the problem one will be moved to quarantine. <br><br>  <b>Common virtual disk enhancements</b> <br>  In Windows Server 2012, it became possible to use shared virtual disks Shared VHDX for several virtual machines.  This feature allows for the rapid implementation of typical virtual failover clusters.  The disadvantage of this feature is that it does not support backup scripts that run on the server for virusization. <br><br>  Windows Server TP2 eliminated this problem - the host-based backup scripts for Shared VHDX work, and the option of hot resizing the disk appeared.  It is worth noting that these features will require conversion to the new VHDS format. <br><br>  <b>Conclusion</b> <br>  In this post I told you about the new and changed features of Windows Server Technical Preview 2, which, in comparison with Windows Server 2012, have been significantly improved.  Microsoft confidently sets the tone for the hypervisor and cloud computing industry.  And if a few years ago it was possible to have doubts about the use of Hyper-V in its infrastructure, then now it is worth thinking again about the opening possibilities of this choice. <br><br>  My project experience suggests that the use of modern IT solutions significantly increases the efficiency of IT infrastructure operation.  When planning changes, it is always worthwhile to calculate moves a few steps forward. <br><br>  Thanks for attention. <br><br>  To download Windows Server Technical Preview 2, use the link: <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/evalcenter/evaluate-windows-server-technical-preview">www.microsoft.com/en-us/evalcenter/evaluate-windows-server-technical-preview</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/264249/">https://habr.com/ru/post/264249/</a></p>
