  <section class="page js-page"><h1>iGrajdanin: social service for caring people</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  In the corporate blog "Smart-Soft" we decided to publish not only related to information technology articles.  Today we will talk about social services, in which the company is directly involved.  Our CEO Andrey Davidovich, who is also the managing partner and one of the creators of this interesting project, tells about the <a href="http://www.igrajdanin.ru/">iGraydanin</a> website. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  About e-government in Russia began to speak at the beginning of the two thousandth, and since then, many ideas have been implemented.  First of all, I mean the portal of public services, which is now used by hundreds of thousands of people in our country.  There are other projects launched from above.  This is very good, but there is a huge problem - the available services function fragmentary.  The lack of a single entry point prevents network users from effectively interacting with government agencies: for example, in order to send a message about an illegal dump, you will have to find the agency dealing with this issue (at least, its email address) and then independently monitor the execution of the appeal. <br><br>  In 2012, we launched the <a href="http://www.igrajdanin.ru/">iGrajdanin</a> information service based on the principles of crowdsourcing.  It is relevant mainly for the residents of Kolomna near Moscow (the project was created by caring citizens: Andrei Lezhnin, Anton Smirnov, Karen Ter-Oganov and the author of this article), but quickly expands its sphere of influence throughout the country thanks to the high activity of Russian Internet users and the support of Smart-Soft ".  For six months, the service has expanded and ‚Äúregistered‚Äù in fifteen cities, and the developers debugged the mechanism of interaction with local administrations: I would like to highlight the positive experience of cooperation with the government of the capital - the few complaints Muscovites have worked out very clearly until the result. <br><br>  It is very easy to interact with the site (this is an important difference from government projects): just register, log in (Facebook and VK login are supported) and you can report problems.  The main task of iGraydanin is to give messages the status of official appeals.  People write here about the road and communal services, the social sphere, the work of transport, etc., express ideas on how to make life in the city more comfortable.  The service automatically sends the data to the official responsible for solving the problem and monitors the processing status of the request.  In fact, it is a kind of gateway between users who are accustomed to a convenient interface and a bulky state machine.

      <br>
      With iGraydanin, we, as they say, got to the point: six years after the adoption of the law on the procedure for handling appeals (including electronic) of citizens, the officials no longer openly ignore it and the appearance of such resources is quite natural.  They allow you to make information public and this is a good incentive for the executive branch ‚Äî when the whole city finds out about the problem, it becomes difficult to ignore it.  Of course, critical publications in blogs and social networks were before, but they did not have an official status and could not be paid attention to such things in state structures. <br><br>  The service created a few months ago is constantly evolving: in 2013, we plan to release a mobile application for iOS and Android that will be as easy as possible to interact with users.  In addition, on iGrajdanin there will be a rating of officials and special projects for problems that are not solved by the authorities, but can be removed by the civil society.  Our most important task is for officials to work more actively with iGraydanin - a personal account will be created for them, allowing them to track the process of solving problems. <br><br>  Unfortunately, not many government agencies want to work with an existing service, preferring to create new products and trying to impose them on network users.  There are serious difficulties with the lack of reaction to official appeals within the time limits established by law.  I think the point here is related to the inability to control the analytics of the system of fears - the ineffective work of a specific artist on our site is clearly visible.  Meanwhile, with the help of such resources, any official can raise his rating, but only the initiative from below will force him to interact with citizens through projects created by the community.  The more popular the service becomes with the population, the more difficult it is to ignore it, so I urge everyone to actively use iGraydanin. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/176971/">https://habr.com/ru/post/176971/</a></p>
