    <hr><br><h2>  Software development </h2><br><hr><br><ul><li>  <b><a href="https://herbsutter.com/">Sutter's mill</a></b> </li></ul><br>  The blog of Herb Sutter, an expert (and author of books) on C ++.  It is not surprising that, in the blog, the Coat of Arms talks mainly about the intricacies of C ++ programming, lays out videos and notes from his speeches at specialized conferences and publishes an essay on the development of programming, information technologies and concurrency, the most famous of which are his sequel " <a href="https://herbsutter.com/welcome-to-the-jungle/">Welcome to the Jungle</a> ". <br><br><hr><br><ul><li>  <b><a href="https://henrikwarne.com/">Henrik Warne's blog</a></b> </li></ul><br>  Blog Henrik Warne (Henrik Warne) from Stockholm, a software developer with 20 years of experience.  In it, he tells about his experience as a programmer and observations made on the basis of many years of work in the profession.  A blog will be useful to those who want to learn more about IT career planning and motivate themselves to study programming in depth. <br><br><hr><br><ul><li>  <b><a href="http://codesimplicity.com/">Code Simplicity</a></b> </li></ul><br>  The author of the blog is Max Kanat-Alexander, the author of the book ‚Äú <a href="http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920022251.do">Code Simplicity.</a>  <a href="http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920022251.do">The Fundamentals of Software</a> believes that there are too many complex things in our world.  Therefore, the blog is based on the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãsimplicity in everything, and its main goal is to make the complex world of programming understandable and accessible.  Now Max is working in Google, where he also has a <a href="https://testing.googleblog.com/2017/04/code-health-googles-internal-code.html">blog</a> .  In his free time, he <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/imagineeighty/videos">writes music</a> , plays the guitar and sings. <br><br><hr><br><ul><li>  <b><a href="https://martinfowler.com/intro.html">martinfowler.com</a></b> </li></ul><br>  ‚ÄúI started this blog in 2000 and since then I managed to turn into a monster of writing articles about various aspects of software development,‚Äù says Martin Fowler.  Martin has worked for the <a href="https://www.thoughtworks.com/">ThoughtWorks</a> software development company, and is also the author of half a dozen books, for example, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0201485672">Refactoring:</a> The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0321127420">Patterns of Enterprise Application Architecture</a> and often <a href="https://martinfowler.com/videos.html">speaks at conferences</a> .  Among the features of the blog can be noted a huge amount of materials and easy <a href="https://martinfowler.com/intro.html">navigation</a> . <br><br><hr><br><ul><li>  <b><a href="https://blog.codinghorror.com/">Coding Horror.</a></b>  <b><a href="https://blog.codinghorror.com/">Programming and Human Factors</a></b> </li></ul><br>  Jeff Atwood, one of the creators of the much-loved Stack Overflow, created his blog back in 2004 to track software development, record thoughts and share stories about work results.  The blog will be interesting for both beginners and advanced developers.  A nice bonus is the opportunity to have a dialogue with Jeff directly, since, in his opinion, any blog should be built in the format of two-way communication. <br><br><hr><br><h2>  IS, Testing and IT Management </h2><br><hr><br><ul><li>  <b><a href="https://aphyr.com/">Aphyr</a></b> </li></ul><br>  Security guru Kyle Kingsbury (Kyle Kingsbury) aka Aphyr, expert for testing distributed systems ( <a href="https://jepsen.io/">Jepsen</a> ) and developer of the tool for monitoring and processing events <a href="http://riemann.io/">Riemann</a> in his blog shares the secrets of working with Jepsen, reviews on games, tells how to pass an interview on developer post, and more. <br><br><hr><br><ul><li>  <b><a href="https://www.highscalability.com/">High scalability</a></b> </li></ul><br>  This site was created by Ted Hoff as an attempt to combine as much knowledge, lifehacks and stories about practical experience in creating scalable websites in one place.  Especially worth noting is the series of posts of Real Life Architectures - regular publications on how to work on scaling in eBay, Flickr, MySpace, LiveJournal and Amazon. <br><br><hr><br><ul><li>  <b><a href="https://watirmelon.blog/">WatirMelon.Blog</a></b> </li></ul><br>  Australian Alister Scott (Alister Scott) created his blog to share experience as a tester and security specialist.  Inside you will find reviews, reports, related links and many other useful materials.  In a blog, you can search for posts by specific tags, and the style of the author of the articles is full and clear.  You can also read Alistair‚Äôs book <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25788685-pride-and-paradev">Pride and Paradev</a> (and what a paradev is, you can find it <a href="https://watirmelon.blog/2013/01/31/so-what-exactly-is-a-paradev/">here</a> ). <br><br><hr><br><ul><li>  <b><a href="http://larahogan.me/blog/">Lara callender hogan</a></b> </li></ul><br>  The author of <a href="http://designingforperformance.com/">Designing for Performance</a> , <a href="http://buildingadevicelab.com/">Building a Device Lab</a> , and <a href="https://abookapart.com/products/demystifying-public-speaking">Demystifying Public Speaking</a> , Lara Hogan, in her blog, talks about the difficulties that you might encounter when working as an IT manager.  The blog will be interesting not only to those who are just going to take this position, but also to those who have experience: there are many posts in the format of tips and lifehacks, as well as materials about the author‚Äôs life experience and working tasks. <br><br><hr><br><ul><li>  <b><a href="http://ewontfix.com/">EWONTFIX</a></b> </li></ul><br>  The goal of Rich Felker's blog is to draw the attention of the audience to the flaws and bugs in the software, especially Free and Open Source.  Even the name of the blog itself EWONTFIX makes fun of developers who refuse to correct or deny their mistakes.  However, instead of simply blaming, the author hopes to raise the quality level of open source software and help beginners avoid mistakes. <br><br><hr><br><ul><li>  <b><a href="http://www.elidedbranches.com/">Elided branches</a></b> </li></ul><br>  As you know, managing a group of people is far from easy.  And the IT industry is no exception.  The author of the blog, as well as the author of the book ‚Äú <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Managers-Path-Leaders-Navigating-Growth/dp/1491973897">The Manager's Path</a> : A Guide for Leadership Navigating Growth and Change‚Äù, shares his experience gained as a project manager, gives useful tips, considers difficult situations that may arise during work. <br><br><hr><br><h2>  3D graphics </h2><br><hr><br><ul><li>  <b><a href="http://c0de517e.blogspot.com/">C0DE517E</a></b> </li></ul><br>  According to the author of the blog, Angelo Pesce (Angelo Pesce), his blog is a place to write rambling and chaotic notes about a variety of things that, thanks to this, you can safely get rid of your head and keep it safe on the Internet.  In part, a blogger is right - the content of posts is very diverse: from tutorials on rendering to advice for candidates who are going to be interviewed.  However, in each post, the author tries to give practical advice and recommendations.  And even if the navigation in the blog is not very convenient, then, using the search, you can find unique materials on the topic of interest. <br><br><hr><br><ul><li>  <b><a href="http://diaryofagraphicsprogrammer.blogspot.com/">Diary of a Graphics Programmer</a></b> </li></ul><br>  Wolfgang Engel, the author of the blog, is the CEO of <a href="http://www.confettispecialfx.com/">Confetti</a> , whose products and services were used in the development of games like Tomb Raider, Call of Duty Black Ops 3, Battlefield 1, Mafia 3 and many others.  In addition, Wolfgang is the author of several books that game developers and renderers often recommend reading.  Among them, for example: " <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Programming-Vertex-Shaders-Charles-Graphics/dp/1584503491">Programming Vertex and Pixel Shaders</a> ", " <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Beginning-Direct3D-Programming-Premier-Development/dp/193184139X">Beginning Direct3D Game Programming</a> " and " <a href="https://www.amazon.com/ShaderX4-Rendering-Techniques-Wolfgang-Engel/dp/1584504250">Shaderx 4 Advanced Rendering Techniques</a> ."  The blog is kept in a diary format in which Wolfgang describes work tasks and how to solve them.  All this, of course, is complemented by illustrations, diagrams, diagrams and code examples. <br><br><hr><br><ul><li>  <b><a href="http://graphicrants.blogspot.com/">Graphic raants</a></b> </li></ul><br>  Blog author Brian Karis is a graphics programmer at <a href="https://www.epicgames.com/ru">Epic Games</a> .  In a blog, he shares thoughts about graphics, game development, as well as news from the life of the company.  A distinctive feature of the blog - a detailed analysis of the material and links to reputable sources at the end of almost every post. <br><br><hr><br><ul><li>  <b><a href="http://www.reedbeta.com/">Nathan Reed</a></b> </li></ul><br>  The author of the blog Nathan Reed has experience in companies like <a href="http://www.nvidia.com/content/global/global.php">NVIDIA</a> and <a href="http://www.devtechsys.com/">DevTech</a> , and at <a href="https://www.suckerpunch.com/">Sucker Punch Productions</a> he developed rendering technology for the <a href="https://www.infamousthegame.com/">Infamous</a> games on PS3 and PS4.  Since 2002, he has worked on a variety of tasks, including the creation of fog, surround lighting, engaged in visualization in linear space, as well as optimizing the performance of the graphics processor.  In addition to graphics, the author is interested in theoretical physics and programming languages.  He writes about all this in his blog.  The realized projects of the author can be found at <a href="http://www.reedbeta.com/made/">this</a> link. <br><br><hr><br><ul><li>  <b><a href="http://www.realtimerendering.com/blog/">Real time rendering</a></b> </li></ul><br>  Three developers lead the blog: Thomas, Eric and Neti (Tomas Akenine-M√∂ller, Eric Haines and Naty Hoffman), who are also authors of the eponymous <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Real-Time-Rendering-Tomas-MOller/dp/1568814240">book</a> .  For the most part, a blog consists of explanations, comments and a detailed analysis of the issues raised in it. <br><br><hr><br><ul><li>  <b><a href="https://blog.demofox.org/">The blog at the bottom of the sea</a></b> </li></ul><br>  The main topics of this blog are game and graphics development.  However, in addition to this, the author talks about such things as, for example, development in C ++.  It is worth noting the regularity of the blog update (an average of 3-4 publications per month), a sufficiently large amount of visual material and light humor in most posts. <br><br><hr><br><h2>  Game development </h2><br><hr><br><ul><li>  <b><a href="http://preshing.com/">Refreshing on programming</a></b> </li></ul><br>  Jeff Preshing, who dedicated 13 years of his life to game devs and worked on projects such as Rainbow Six, Child of Light and Assassin's Creed, writes mostly about Python and C ++ on his blog.  However, Jeff himself considers the main themes of his blog to be ‚Äúreverent awe of programming and endless love for him.‚Äù <br><br><hr><br><ul><li>  <b><a href="https://eev.ee/">Fuzzy Notepad</a></b> </li></ul><br>  The posts of blogger Ivy (Eevee) are devoted to programming in general, however, this blog will be most useful for game developers.  <a href="https://eev.ee/dev/">Here</a> you can find weekly reports on the development process and the difficulties associated with the process of creating games.  And also - materials about drawing, teaching technologies, specific languages ‚Äã‚Äãand platforms (Ivi writes very detailed and thorough analyzes - which he immediately warns readers about). <br><br><hr><br><ul><li>  <b><a href="http://ithare.com/">IT Hare on Soft.ware</a></b> </li></ul><br>  On this site you will not find banal programming tips and answers to common questions, because the authors of the resource believe that their audience knows how to use Google and Stack Overflow.  But there is a lot of information about software development, game development, security, and IP architecture. <br><br><hr><br><ul><li>  <b><a href="http://fabiensanglard.net/">Fabien Sanglard's Website</a></b> </li></ul><br>  Fabien Sanglard, the author of the site, devoted his blog to game development and everything connected with it.  Inside there are detailed analyzes of the source code (for example, <a href="http://fabiensanglard.net/doom3/index.php">Doom 3</a> ), <a href="http://fabiensanglard.net/c/index.php">tips</a> on ‚ÄúHow to become a good developer in C?‚Äù, Collections of <a href="http://mrelusive.com/books/books.html">books</a> , solving <a href="http://fabiensanglard.net/timer_and_framerate/index.php">various game problems</a> and much more.  A nice bonus will be the organic design of the site and easy navigation. <br><br><hr><br><ul><li>  <b><a href="http://www.pentadact.com/">Tom Francis Regrets This Already</a></b> </li></ul><br>  The developer of the game " <a href="http://www.gunpointgame.com/">Gunpoint</a> " Tom Francis (Tom Francis) does not stop there.  More recently, on September 21, Tom released another game called ‚Äú <a href="http://www.heatsig.com/">Heat Signature</a> ‚Äù, the creation process of which is described in the blog.  In addition, Tom is testing <a href="http://www.pentadact.com/2016-05-14-rewarding-creative-play-styles-in-hitman/">different games</a> , recording <a href="http://crateandcrowbar.com/">podcasts</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/Pentadact">videos</a> on YouTube.  In addition, he is the author of <a href="http://www.pentadact.com/tag/things-i-wrote-for-pc-gamer/">articles</a> for the PC Gamer and several <a href="http://www.pentadact.com/2013-03-05-my-short-story-for-the-second-machine-of-death-collection/">stories</a> for the science fiction collection Machine of Death. <br><br><hr><br>  PS Our digests: <br><br><ul><li>  <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/it-grad/blog/337836/">15 code structuring materials for developers</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/it-grad/blog/331620/">100 practical materials on safety, economics and IaaS tools</a> </li></ul><br>  PPS What else do we write in our corporate blog: <br><br><ul><li>  <a href="http://iaas-blog.it-grad.ru/funkcionalnost/balansirovka-nagruzki-v-oblake-iaas/">IaaS cloud load balancing</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://iaas-blog.it-grad.ru/funkcionalnost/virtualizaciya-prilozhenij-kak-pravilno-nastraivat-virtualnye-mashiny/">Application Virtualization: How to Configure Virtual Machines</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://iaas-blog.it-grad.ru/bezopasnost/osobennosti-dvuxfaktornoj-autentifikacii/">Features of two-factor authentication: does it work in the IaaS cloud</a> </li></ul></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/340136/">https://habr.com/ru/post/340136/</a></p>
