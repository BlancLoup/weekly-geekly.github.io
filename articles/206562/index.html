But it‚Äôs always hard to say goodbye to what you‚Äôre used to.  And I'm not talking about the portal at all, as such - I mean our community, which has been created over the years.  These are millions of users who vigorously discussed regular news on the forum, shared interesting photos, published articles and simply shared their thoughts with friends.  This was our virtual home, in which we spent not the worst hours of our lives.  And this all suddenly disappears into oblivion, disappears from the network and remains only a memory ... No, that should not be so.  You can always find an opportunity to preserve what is dear to you.  And I am pleased to announce that we all have such an opportunity today. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  As you already understood from the picture, I'm talking about the new portal Vivaldi.net.  Perhaps you are interested in who decided to build a new home for the MyOpera user community.  I can say that this is a well-known person to many of you, who once initiated the birth of the MyOpera portal, Jon von Tachner.  Let's not guess what prompted him to take such a step - just read his letter addressed to all MyOpera users. <br><br><blockquote>  Like many of you, I was very upset by the news of the imminent closure of My Opera.  The user community was a powerful and vital part of Opera, which was key to the success of both the Opera browser and the My Opera portal.  I spent a lot of time reading your comments in forums and blogs, and I still continue to do so.  The support you gave us at Opera was irreplaceable.  Without you, there would be no Opera browser.

      I, as one of the founders of Opera, have a hard time seeing the destruction of the community that we have created together.  Therefore, some of those who for years have created a browser and portal for you, decided to get together and build a new home for you, our old friends. <br><br>  As you can see, a lot of work remains to be done.  The news of the closure of My Opera was unexpected and we tried to prepare a new portal as quickly as possible.  We wanted to open it as soon as possible to let you know that there is a place where we can get together again. <br><br>  I hope that you will like the new portal and you will help us to make it as convenient as possible for you, because you are our community. <br><br>  Your friend, <br><br>  Yo </blockquote><br><br>  So, I invite you all to our common new home - the <a href="http://www.vivaldi.net/">portal Vivaldi.net</a> , which I hope will be a good replacement for My Opera. <br><br>  Probably, the picture on the screen saver raises some questions, so I will explain.  The picture shows the northern lights over Iceland, and this is not accidental: Jon is from Iceland and it is here, in the country of geysers, glaciers and volcanoes, we have placed our servers.  But do not worry - it is absolutely safe in all respects, both in terms of the safety of the servers themselves, and all the data that you will store on them. <br><br>  Briefly about what we have prepared for you on the new portal.  Here you can blog, store your photo albums, chat using the built-in chat or email service, make new acquaintances and, of course, chat with your old friends.  We also prepared <a href="https://vivaldi.net/blogs/entry/vivaldi/migrating-images-to-vivaldi-net">small instructions</a> on how to transfer some of your data from My Opera to a new portal.  That's all and <a href="http://www.vivaldi.net/">see</a> you on <a href="http://www.vivaldi.net/">Vivaldi.net</a> ! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/206562/">https://habr.com/ru/post/206562/</a></p>
