  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Usability: sawing state budgets is far away</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The second, and therefore already legally called annual <a href="http://userexp.ru/">User Experience 2008</a> conference, was held in the last days of October at the Infospace Center in Moscow.  The program, as <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/ui_design_and_usability/16096/">in the past year</a> , was a mass of reports both for professionals and for those just interested in the topic. <br><br>  For example, a lot of positive feedback from listeners gathered Jeff Johnson, a senior consultant at <a href="http://www.uiwizards.com/">UI Wizards Inc..</a>  and author of the book "Web Bloopers".  Jeff had a lot of fun for listeners with stories about common mistakes in web-interface design and called for more often to listen to their own common sense. <br><br>  But if everyone had enough of their common sense, there would not be the very scope of usability consulting services.  And this market, according to <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/dmitrysatin/" class="user_link">dmitrysatin</a> , is on the contrary ‚Äúbottomless‚Äù. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  And although ‚Äúbottomless‚Äù also means ‚Äúnot amenable to any dimensions‚Äù (only estimates like ‚Äúusability market volume = web development market size in general / 10‚Äù), Alexander Denisovets from the <a href="http://www.webmastera.org/">Union of Webmasters of Russia</a> is sure that there is a demand for usability .

      Now in Russia this demand is more likely caused by curiosity than by confidence in the profitability of investments in improving UI, but world practice has already fully matured to sum up statistics.  Tommy Strandvall of the Swedish company <a href="http://www.tobii.com/">Tobii</a> cited data from the study of Jacob Nielsen from the beginning of this year.  According to them, the return on investment in work on usability today is about 83% per annum. <br><br>  6 years ago, it was 130% - and this, according to Tommy, says that now the convenience of the interface just immediately pay more attention.  And the percentage of site visitors who can be turned into customers has doubled on average over the past 6 years - from 1% to 2%. <br><br>  Therefore, when Dmitry Satin promises that UsabilityLab is ready to double the incomes of ‚Äúvirtually any‚Äù online store, you can agree with him, relying on this statistics. <br><br>  And you can not agree, of course.  But the interest of e-business in the ‚Äúcheap‚Äù way to increase its sales is likely to grow anyway.  And sometime the state will also be engaged in the development of new trends.  Which, as Denis Kotlyarov from Microsoft rightly noted, ‚Äúis a large corporation‚Äù.  And to which, undoubtedly, a high degree of comfort in using departmental websites is needed to reduce the costs of servicing its clients - citizens. <br><br>  But when it comes ‚Äúsomeday‚Äù, no one will predict now.  Alexander Denisovets believes that even before the formulation of recommendations on the fulfillment of the mandatory conditions of the UN Convention on the Protection of the Rights of Persons with Disabilities signed by the Russian Federation, ‚Äúapproximately 10 years‚Äù will pass.  When I asked whether it was worth waiting for the emergence of the federal usability budget program, Alexander just smiled with a clear sense of the ‚Äúdream-dream‚Äù. <br><br>  The convention has not yet been ratified by the State Duma.  But its provisions aimed at ensuring the availability of information for people with disabilities - this is just a question that would be worthwhile to attend to now.  Victoria Zontikova, a spokesperson for the United Nations Office in Russia, said that now only 2% of the information flow is accessible to people with visual limitations.  Worldwide, Internet sites that fully meet the requirements of the convention can be counted on fingers. <br><br>  According to the general feelings, the groundwork that UsabilityLab together with its partners laid last year has already yielded some fruits this year.  It seems that the number of people who are generally familiar with the meaning of the concept of usability has doubled.  And those who consider it all obscurantism and pseudoscience - on the contrary diminished.  And because of this, it became more useful sense, which managed to pass during UserExp. <br><br>  And the ribbons on the badges of the conference attendees are twice as thick.  So money in the industry has already wound up ... </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/44013/">https://habr.com/ru/post/44013/</a></p>
