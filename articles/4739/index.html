  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Journalist will answer for Kovrov's forum</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The unflattering posts on the <a href="http://kovrov.ru/">forum</a> site of the provincial town of Kovrov were announced by Dmitry Tashlykov, a columnist for the Vladimirsky Krai newspaper.  It was he who was charged during the trial initiated by Vladimir Region Governor Nikolai Vinogradov.  Vinogradov wrote a statement to the ‚Äúorgans‚Äù after he learned that on the website kovrov.ru, in the most voluntary terms, there is a discussion of his gubernatorial activities. <br><br>  In a statement, the governor accused "members of the forum" of defamation.  But the composition of this crime in the statements was not found.  Instead, they found that several participants in the discussion violated article 319 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation, insulting a representative of the authorities. <br><br>  Today, <a href="http://www.regnum.ru/">Regnum</a> published the text of the decision to bring Tashlykov as an accused in this case.  It says that the accused took an active part in discussing the events of the social and political life of Kovrov and the Vladimir region, publishing messages under the nickname Myshkin on the forum.  In particular, it is known that in the section of the site ‚ÄúHistory, Politics, Mass Media‚Äù rumors about the preparation of the contract killing of the head of Kovrov Irina Tabatskova were discussed with statements about the possible involvement of the governor in this.

      ‚ÄúMyshkin deliberately, with the intention to publicly humiliate the honor and dignity of Vladimir Region Governor Nikolai Vinogradov, realizing the indecent and offensive nature of his speech, published a message on the Kovrov forum‚Äú This creature, called the governor, is capable of anything, ‚Äùsays investigator Vladimir Klimov.  Another message, which became ‚Äúknown to the unlimited circle of people‚Äù and thus caused moral suffering to the governor, is this: ‚ÄúFor almost 10 years this bitch has been playing the whole area.  If we could prove his involvement in the impending assassination attempt (if it is being prepared), the Kremlin would remove the governor at one moment. ‚Äù  The investigation concluded that Tashlykov was hiding under the name Myshkin, and as a result, the journalist was also accused of violating part 130 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation.  He faces a punishment in the form of a year of correctional labor or a monetary fine. <br><br>  At the same time, Dmitry Tashlykov himself does not plead guilty, believing that the regional administration in the person of Governor Vinogradov made a ‚Äúpolitical order‚Äù against him.  He noted that while working freelancely with the newspaper ‚ÄúVladimirsky Krai‚Äù, he did press reviews, and often had criticism of the head of the region.  ‚ÄúI think that everything taken together caused hostility towards me from the side of Governor Vinogradov,‚Äù said Tashlykov, ‚Äúand the fact that I have a‚Äú home ‚ÄùInternet was only a clue to initiate a criminal case against a person who has no relation to my Myshkin nickname Kovrov forum ". </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/4739/">https://habr.com/ru/post/4739/</a></p>
