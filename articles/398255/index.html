Once again, the manufacturer followed the ‚Äúvery good and very cheap‚Äù principle: in China, Redmi Note 4 went on sale at a price of $ 135.  The fourth generation of the Remdi Note line is similar to the previous one, but on the whole the model has been significantly improved: the novelty has received an updated camera, all-metal case and a new platform - inside the Redmi Note 4 there is a ten-core processor. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/132/7fc/06b/1327fc06b1172ab2c7bcce44d558088d.jpg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b>Specifications Xiaomi Redmi Note 4</b> <br><blockquote><ul><li>  <b>Screen:</b> 5.5 '' FullHD </li><li>  <b>Processor:</b> Ten-core MediaTek Helio X20 2.1 GHz </li><li>  <b>Graphics accelerator:</b> Mali-T880 MP4 </li><li>  <b>Operating system:</b> Android 6.0 + MIUI 7.3 </li><li>  <b>RAM:</b> 2/3 GB </li><li>  <b>Built-in memory:</b> 16/64 GB </li><li>  <b>Memory card support:</b> microSD, microSDHC, microSDXC </li><li>  <b>Connectivity:</b> GSM / EDGE, UMTS / HSDPA, LTE </li><li>  <b>SIM:</b> microSIM + nanoSIM (combo slot) </li><li>  <b>Wireless interfaces:</b> Bluetooth 4.2, Wi-Fi 802.11a / b / g / n / ac </li><li>  <b>Navigation:</b> GPS (with A-GPS support), GLONASS </li><li>  <b>Cameras:</b> main - 13 megapixel (autofocus, flash), front - 5 megapixel </li><li>  <b>Sensors:</b> fingerprint scanner, FM radio, G-Sensor, gyroscope, light sensor, proximity sensor, digital compass </li><li>  <b>Battery:</b> 4100 mAh </li><li>  <b>Dimensions:</b> 76x151x8.35 mm </li><li>  <b>Weight:</b> 175 grams </li></ul></blockquote><br><h2>  Design and ergonomics </h2><br>  Externally, in <a href="http://www.gearbest.com/cell-phones/pp_462199.html%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_medium%3Dyulia%26utm_campaign%3Dg16">Xiaomi Redmi Note 4 it is</a> very difficult to recognize the device of a low price category (internally, too, but more on that later): the smartphone is enclosed in a solid metal case without plastic inserts, the back panel is curved at the edges.  On it are narrow plugs for antennas, as well as the usual center round lens of the camera, flash and fingerprint scanner. <br><br>  The design of the smartphone consists of a very elegant combination of clear edges with smooth lines.  Rounding the back of the case allows you to comfortably hold it in your hand, despite the large size.  Due to the dense assembly and quality materials, the gadget is perceived as an expensive and status thing.

Below the screen are the hardware buttons "Menu", "Back" and "Home".  They are equipped with soft lighting and vibration feedback. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/159/ebd/4cf/159ebd4cf7a1d908c88dc71185e967f1.jpg"><br><br>  The case of the Xiaomi Redmi Note 4 is not collapsible.  The SIM card slot is removed from the left edge with a special clip.  It is combined, allows you to install either microSIM and nanoSIM, or microSIM and a memory card. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/046/48e/f5a/04648ef5a75e91054734f326ac601023.jpg"><br><br><h2>  Fingerprint scanner </h2><br>  The fingerprint scanner, located on the back of the Xiaomi Redmi Note 4, is distinguished by its high response speed: it takes literally a fraction of a second to touch the round touchpad with your finger.  The scanner also works when the screen is locked - to turn on the smartphone, simply touch your finger.  Fingerprint registration does not take much time - the system requires about seven to ten touches to memorize a finger.  In general, the technology is perfectly implemented and helps to save time when working with a gadget.  The only thing, taking into account the large diagonal of the device, it is not always possible to clearly put a finger on the scanner (it turns out to be attached by the side of the pad), which sometimes leads to a trigger error. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/c9d/881/cc0/c9d881cc0f57d945d1a5c230e894f19c.jpg"><br><br><h2>  Screen </h2><br>  There is a small black frame around the Xiaomi Redmi Note 4 display, but it absolutely does not interfere with perception - its width is only a couple of millimeters, and the screen itself is large, 5.5 inches.  FulHD resolution provides a very clear picture, without looseness and distinct points.  Maximum brightness is enough to work on the street, plus there is a quick and adequate automatic adjustment. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/b0b/808/741/b0b808741dee67ec218daf9a5cddd7e1.jpg"><br><br>  Viewing angles can not be called ideal: the picture fades when tilted, but it still remains visible.  In the settings you can adjust the color temperature of the screen, as well as select one of three color modes - standard, contractual and automatic (implies optimizing the image depending on the light). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/0bc/fe9/d3c/0bcfe9d3c1bfddbb6e612bf262e25da1.png" width="350"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/d81/f10/261/d81f102614833008f6c3044b3d95f51f.png" width="350"><br><br><h2>  Interface </h2><br>  The Xiaomi Redmi Note 4 interface is based on Android 6.0 with MIUI 7.3 firmware installed.  Russian language is not provided in it, only Chinese and English.  Simple utilities are anglified - clock, calculator, notes, voice recorder, player, and so on, they can be used without problems with minimal knowledge of English.  But the shops of those and applications are completely in Chinese, as well as about a third of the pre-installed software.  Everything superfluous (or at least incomprehensible) can be deleted in the settings, and through the branded App Store you can download Google Play, with which you can install all the necessary applications. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/7ef/dcb/8a5/7efdcb8a57909ecaad4bb7267ec56ce6.png" width="350"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/5de/448/c37/5de448c37c2bc9cea3cb7665f7b0f9eb.png" width="350"><br><br><h2>  Apparatus in operation </h2><br>  Xiaomi Redmi Note 4 received a platform, though not from a top manufacturer, but powerful - this is a ten-core SoC MediaTek Helio X20.  The cores operate at a maximum clock speed of 2.1 GHz.  We had a <a href="http://www.gearbest.com/cell-phones/pp_436904.html%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_medium%3Dyulia%26utm_campaign%3Dg16">copy of the</a> test with a 64 GB drive and three GB of RAM, in addition, there is a 16 and 2 GB version for sale.  In AnTuTu, the smartphone ‚Äúknocked out‚Äù is a rather serious result - more than 83 thousand points.  The result is not flagship, but noticeably higher than the average price segment. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/1b9/924/3ba/1b99243baf218b58cbf8ba7a8874e5bd.png" width="350"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/43a/4d0/c37/43a4d0c379eca90130060e8319c34dd9.png" width="350"><br>  <i>Benchmarks of AnTuTu and PCMark</i> <br><br>  To test performance in games, we used the World of Tanks Blitz tank battle simulator.  In it, at low graphics settings, the fps value varies from 40 to 55-60, the body heats up slightly.  At maximum settings, fps drops to 15-17, as a result, the animation looks ragged.  Most likely, most toys will go to Redmi Note 4 adequately, except perhaps not always with maximum graphics. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/aff/b07/681/affb0768176bda5a52fe46be63544546.png"><br><br>  Xiaomi Redmi Note 4 handles telephone functions with a bang: there were no problems with the quality of voice transmission, the sound of the speaker during a conversation is loud enough.  The smartphone supports LTE, the data transfer rate is high.  GPS started and connected to the satellites in just a few seconds. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/eb5/4b8/4da/eb54b84da4bfc4a8d7c8aceb61db6f91.png" width="350"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/28d/1a0/5f3/28d1a05f3bd00595460ebd83c6d86f3a.png" width="350"><br><br><h2>  Camera </h2><br>  Xiaomi Redmi Note 4 received a 13 MP camera - this is less than 16 MP in Redmi 3 Pro, but it shoots better. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/62a/bd2/ee2/62abd2ee29ac861f13973fac1e3665f0.jpg"><br><br>  Basically, the camera focuses quickly, but several times the autofocus slows down when macro shooting.  The pictures are cool: with a beautifully blurred background, a clear object and in most cases correct shadows.  Perhaps, Xiaomi Redmi Note 4 "does" not only competitors in the segment, but also more expensive devices.  With artificial lighting sometimes distorted colors, but in general, all is well.  Night shooting is adequately exposed and does not suffer from noise.  Finally, the application has a manual mode that allows you to adjust the ISO and white balance. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/8c6/2be/299/8c62be299451dacef8917382022c5575.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/2fd/751/9ce/2fd7519ceda604ab0be87aa9d7a25656.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/b71/979/e00/b71979e001091e8c07a91a672d3856b4.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/708/4ea/a1b/7084eaa1b444d3787e23e4e9eec57cb1.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/658/bd2/574/658bd2574414c8a87f61aaa644041387.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/9b0/081/d5d/9b0081d5d82b5f4527f0eadbbee9b09f.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/9b5/f72/48f/9b5f7248f54c4d066b3cbe396db9aaa9.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/d4d/7d8/8c9/d4d7d88c9473a4d671738b070f6f46c0.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/6cf/1a0/bb3/6cf1a0bb344d293860ca22962d46b2a9.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/37a/fdb/73b/37afdb73b0847046286ef478737e7335.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/1a8/e2d/3d4/1a8e2d3d4e036876259bd726c39e4d12.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/539/9ce/359/5399ce3593792c0d342af331b5b2f336.jpg"><br>  <i>Shooting the same story with HDR turned off and on.</i>  <i>This mode helps to get rid of glare and too deep shadows and expands the dynamic range of the image.</i> <br><br><h2>  Autonomous work </h2><br>  The battery capacity of the Xiaomi Redmi Note 4 is outstanding - 4100 mAh - but energy-intensive hardware does not allow to set records of autonomy.  Nevertheless, the novelty discharges slowly: Redmi Note 4 lasted seven and a half hours, continuously playing video with the maximum screen brightness.  According to the results of the PCMark battery test, the battery lasts for six and a half hours of continuous active work.  This is more than a decent result, above the market average.  A full-time battery is just enough; if you like, you can ‚Äústretch‚Äù it for two or more days (depending on the usage scenario). <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/37d/294/c70/37d294c703ab77ee9c3bb85f7c62cf46.png" width="500"></div><br><h2>  Results </h2><br>  Xiaomi Redmi Note 4 is quite similar to its predecessor - Redmi Note 3 Pro.  Why buy a new model?  The reasons are many: this is a more powerful processor, an updated system (the sixth generation of Android instead of the fifth), an increase in memory and a noticeably improved camera.  In the end, the design of Redmi Note 4 became more balanced, with rounded glass and a case without plastic inserts.  At the same time, Redmi Note 4 inherited all the advantages of previous models - it is a monolithic assembly, thanks to which the gadget leaves a feeling of an expensive and high-quality thing;  good autonomy and excellent screen with a large diagonal and high pixel density.  Definitely, this smartphone is worth the money.  Only the absence of the Russian language can cause inconvenience, but, first, local firmware will appear in the future, and secondly, with such a low cost, nothing prevents yourself from reflashing the device. <br><br>  <b>Pros:</b> <br><br><ul><li>  large FullHD screen </li><li>  ten core processor </li><li>  solid metal body </li><li>  fast fingerprint scanner </li></ul><br>  <b>Minuses:</b> <br><br><ul><li>  sometimes it slows down the camera's autofocus </li><li>  There is no Russian language in the base firmware </li></ul><br>  Pleasant discounts: <br><br>  <a href="http://www.gearbest.com/cell-phones/pp_436904.html%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_medium%3Dyulia%26utm_campaign%3Dg16">Xiaomi Redmi Note 4 64GB</a> with REMIT coupon will cost you <strong>$ 200.99</strong> <br>  <a href="http://www.gearbest.com/cell-phones/pp_462199.html%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_medium%3Dyulia%26utm_campaign%3Dg16">Xiaomi Redmi Note 4 3GB</a> with NOTE4G coupon will cost you <strong>$ 191.99</strong> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/398255/">https://habr.com/ru/post/398255/</a></p>
