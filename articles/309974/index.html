      Despite the lack of an official announcement from the scene, Apple will expand the geography of Apple's application to another two countries - New Zealand in October and Russia, which is scheduled to launch on ‚Äúthis autumn‚Äù. <br><br>  In July, the list of countries whose users have access to Apple Pay was added to France, Switzerland and Hong Kong, and the company's global presence expanded to 9 markets.  At the same time, more than half of all Apple Pay international payment transactions occur outside of the United States. <br><br>  The popularity of payment technology is also gaining momentum.  Each week, Apple Pay's client base increases by one million new users.  For all this time, the service has helped consumers spend billions.  The acceleration of growth was particularly noticeable in the second half of 2015. <br><br>  The growth rate observed during this period was 10 times higher than in the first half of the year, while the number of applications of the payment instrument in applications in the second half of 2015 more than doubled compared to the first half. <br><br>  Today, Apple Pay has already gone to tens of millions of users, while the monthly number of active users in June increased by 450% compared with the same figures last year. <br><br>  Apple Pay currently accepts over 11 million merchants around the world equipped with contactless terminals, 3 million of which are located in the United States. <br><br>  The technology also won the lion‚Äôs share of the US mobile payment market.  According to Phil Schiller, more than 90 percent of wireless payment transactions in the United States are done using Apple Pay. <br><br>  The functionality of Apple Pay for websites became available with the launch of iOS 10, which took place on September 13th.  You can use Apple Pay in Safari, provided that your Mac is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/06/22/an-early-look-at-macos-sierra/">running on macOS Sierra and was produced no earlier than 2012</a> . <br><br>  To use Apple Pay in a browser, you need to make sure that the website you are looking for supports this payment method and find the appropriate payment button when placing the order.  After that, the purchase must be completed using the TouchID on the iPhone or through Apple Watch. <br><br>  When you pay with Apple Pay, the transaction information is encrypted and transferred by your device to Apple Pay servers, and the online merchant, in turn, eliminates the need to store your credit card numbers in its database, which allows you to provide Apple Pay users additional level of protection. <br><br>  According to the <a href="http://www.coindesk.com/circle-brings-blockchain-payments-iphone-ios-10-update/">Coindesk</a> publication, <a href="http://www.coindesk.com/circle-brings-blockchain-payments-iphone-ios-10-update/">Circle</a> 's payment p2p project, based on the Bitcoin blockchain, reported on the integration of social payments with iMessage for iOS 10, which indicates the development of iMessage's potential as an open platform for developers.  About the addition of Circle to the iMessage functionality, it also became known after the release of the iOS 10 update. Users of the iPhone 5, iPod Touch 6th generation, iPad mini 2 tablets and higher, the fourth generation iPad, as well as iPad Air and iPad can use the Bitcoin start-up functionality. Pro.  Thanks to the enhanced iMessage functionality at the expense of Circle, users will be able to transfer dollars, euros, pounds and Bitcoins to each other.  Also, users can transfer money and withdraw funds from an account in any bank in the US and the UK.  Europe is next in line. <br><br>  In early September, Apple <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/iphone7-enables-bitcoin-payments-ethereum-classic-might-be-next">allowed</a> Jaxx blockchain wallets to work with only 6 types of cryptocurrencies: Bitcoin, Dogecoin, Litecoin, Ethereum, the DAO and Ripple, demanding that Dash cryptocurrency be removed from the functionality of the Jaxx mobile application. <br><br>  <i>Continue to follow <a href="http://payonline.ru/%3Futm_source%3Dhabrahabr%26utm_medium%3Dreferral%26utm_campaign%3Dwebpayments-main">PayOnline</a> processing blog updates and stay up to date with the latest news from the global payment industry.</i> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/309974/">https://habr.com/ru/post/309974/</a></p>
