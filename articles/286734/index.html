Winning interview in 6 steps</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/248/d26/e6c/248d26e6ca4f491786928b67054337e1.png" alt="Block" align="left">  I bring to your attention the translation of the article by the vice-president of ‚ÄúGoogle‚Äù on work with personnel. <br><br>  Recently, several amazing things have happened to me.  First, the publisher sent me a copy of my new book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Work-Rules-Insights-Inside-Transform/dp/1455554790/ref%3Dasap_bc%3Fie%3DUTF8">Work Rules!</a>  Secondly, after my <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/23/opinion/sunday/friedman-how-to-get-a-job-at-google.html%3F_r%3D0">interview with Tom Friedman,</a> one CEO of a large company asked me how to apply some of the methods I described in the interview.  And thirdly, a new employee of the company in which I work (Google) stopped me in one of the cafes of our campus and told me that he had read all my articles on Google‚Äôs resume and requirements, and as a result was hired. <br><br>  Let's assume that you, like my new friend, have a great resume in which you avoid mistakes that prevent the other 60 percent of the resume from becoming effective. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  You are now at the interview.  How to convince the person at the other end of the table to hire you?  How to win in this situation?

      Use the fact that most of us are not very good at this. <br><br>  ‚ÄúYou will never have a second chance to make a first impression,‚Äù the headline advertising campaign of Head &amp; Shoulders in the eighties. <br><br>  This expression perfectly describes the interview today.  Tricia Pricket and Neya Gada-Jain, two psychology students at the University of Toledo, in collaboration with Professor Frank Berieri in two thousand, published a study that the judgments made in the first 10 seconds after the start can predict the outcome of the conversation. <br><br>  In other words, most of what we think about interviews is actually far from the truth.  Most interviews are a waste of time, because 99.4 percent of the time is spent trying to validate the initial impression.  All of these: ‚ÄúTell me about yourself.‚Äù ‚ÄúWhat is your biggest weakness?‚Äù And even ‚ÄúWhat are your strengths?‚Äù - they are not worth anything. <br><br>  If you are looking for a job, the lack of understanding of the right interview for most of us is itself a trump card.  This disadvantage can be used to manage a meeting.  <i>What should be done?</i> <br><br><h4>  Predict the future. </h4><br>  90 percent of the questions of any interview are fairly predictable.  Write a list and think over the answers.  If nothing comes up, look for the 20 best questions of this kind with a search engine. <br><br><h4>  Plan an attack. </h4><br>  For each question, write your answer with your own hand to activate the mechanical and visual memory.  You want to achieve automatic responses? <br><br><h4>  Always have a plan "B". </h4><br>  In fact, for each question write three answers.  Why three?  You must have options.  If the first interview does not work, you will need to say something to another visitor. <br><br><h4>  Prove yourself. </h4><br>  Every answer to a question must be thought out down to examples.  Answering the asked question, always give examples from the life, proving your competence in the subject. <br><br><h4>  Look around. </h4><br>  Use to answer the question all that you see around.  Look around.  Focus on the other person.  For the first ten seconds, pay attention to the features of the interior, various surrounding objects and the behavior of the interlocutor to use this to provide a favorable impression. <br><br><h4>  Do everything to Carnegie Hall. </h4><br>  How to be on the stage of Carnegie Hall?  The answer is simple - practice.  The same goes for getting a job. <br><br>  When I was in my second year at business school, I practiced interviews out loud until I could tell myself about myself.  As a result, I received 7 job offers from 5 companies. <br>  How is this possible?  Practice! <br>  Everyone deserves an amazing job.  I hope that the article will help get this to all readers. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/286734/">https://habr.com/ru/post/286734/</a></p>
