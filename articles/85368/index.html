  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Vedic approach to freelance work</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  It will be useful to beginners who have not yet become stronger freelancers with a frustrated approach to customers.  At once I will say that this article is not a stronghold of feng shui and other, non-readable it-community nonsense.  Here is a natural logical approach to life, in particular to customer relations. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  <b>Hello% username%!</b>  <b>Good day to you!</b> <br><br>  So, the Vedas (they have nothing in common with the Slavic-Aryan Vedas lzhnikniga) - a collection of the most ancient scriptures (see <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2592%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B4%25D1%258B">Wikipedia</a> for details), the progenitor of most psychological, medical, physical, sociological and many other knowledge.  To this day, many scoop information from them, embellish it, and pass it off as their discovery, research, or invention.  The Vedas contain spells, historical narratives, exhortations and moralizing.  The last two are most interesting for mere mortals.  We will analyze them further when solving several problems.  If you do not have such problems, perhaps your friends have them.

      <b>Problem 1: Lack of time.</b> <br>  On a loved one, on vacation, on relationships, at work, for part-time work, etc. <br><br>  <b>Problem 2: Shortage of money.</b> <br>  They took out a loan, a child appeared, the rent for renting an apartment rose, they bought a car, moved to a new apartment, quit their job (you or your spouse), etc. <br><br>  <b>Problem 3: Tired of working.</b> <br>  But I can‚Äôt do anything else, I‚Äôm tired of a certain job, I‚Äôm tired of a certain customer, I‚Äôm tired of doing a specific job-related job, etc. <br><br>  <b>Problem 4: Can‚Äôt do anything.</b> <br>  Dream, desire, aspiration, long-standing idea, start a business, get a certain company to customers, etc. <br><br><h4>  Complete solution. </h4><br><br>  1. Change your attitude to money.  Stop thinking (or think much less often) about how much you need, how much is missing for something, how much you would like to receive, how much you should, etc. <br><br>  2. Change your attitude to dreams and desires.  Dream less, do more at least something in your life.  You should not give up dreams, but you need to dream about the accomplishment of what you believe and allow for probability.  And you need to wish for yourself less, not to good it.  Your every desire to get something for yourself takes away your time, money and energy (that is, it also affects your performance).  Especially noteworthy is the prevailing materialism of the majority - the desire to get as much as possible and better than any things, at a time when you can be content with little.  Upgrade a normally working computer (for example, for the sake of games), purchase ‚Äúclothes‚Äù in order to dress up better with some clothes, etc. <br><br>  3. Try to say the word ‚Äútry‚Äù less.  Speak firmly - ‚ÄúI will do it‚Äù or ‚ÄúI will not do it‚Äù (or their synonyms). <br><br>  4. Change your attitude towards people.  First of all it concerns your clients, those who pay for your life.  Love them, but not for paying bills, but for the result of the work.  Strive to do more than agreed, but do not boast about it.  Talk to them about their business, try to help solve their problems (lack of clients, inactive advertising, etc.). <br><br>  5. Talk with your relatives if you do not live alone.  Parents, spouse (s) do not have to constantly remind you about what money is needed for and how much.  Most often, such speeches cause negative feelings in you - despondency, upset, maybe even anger.  Money is better to distribute as they arrive. <br><br>  6. If you haven't started yet - start doing something for yourself.  Startup, project, business, just a site (for example a blog).  Do not waste your time only on work and rest from it - you will live your life without noticing, and then there will be nothing to remember. <br><br>  7. Do not hurry.  Nowhere.  Do things calmly and calmly and come to meetings.  Forget about the lack of time.  If you don‚Äôt have time to do something today, you shouldn‚Äôt stay up until morning, get enough sleep and complete your work much better and faster with new forces. <br><br>  8. Get up before sunrise.  Buy or download sunrise calendar.  If you do not want or forget to look at the calendar - get up at 6 o'clock.  Go to bed preferably at 22, with a maximum of 0 hours. <br><br>  9. Stop cheating.  If you think that you are not deceiving people, stop lying to even yourself. <br><br>  To comprehend such changes need to be consistently and gradually, one after the other and one by one.  Do not immediately try to remember and do everything - it will not work and you will switch to the old habitual way of life. <br>  Finally, I want to communicate the main knowledge needed to switch from one to another - hold out for 21 days, then everything will go like clockwork.  To hold out - use relatives, reminders in the phone and computer, leaflets, whatever you like, the main thing is to hold out. <br><br>  What do you get if you do all this and continue to live like this - a question for self-reflection.  The question <b>‚ÄúWhy do I need exactly this?</b>  "And <b>" Why should it work? "</b> Ask yourself, to prove that you need it, I will not.  If you do not want or do not believe, then this is not for you (you are still not morally and spiritually mature), and if you are ‚Äúplagued by vague doubts,‚Äù just try, then decide for yourself whether to continue. <br><br><h6>  For the most "smart" I will say - "I do not teach you to live, the Vedas teach."  I do not expect approval, I want to share what helped me and helps to get great pleasure from work, do not need money and have a little more rest. </h6></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/85368/">https://habr.com/ru/post/85368/</a></p>
