The event was attended by 67 participants and 12 teams from Kiev, Kharkov, Dnepropetrovsk and Odessa. <br>  Within the framework of the hackathon, two round tables were held, the first of which was devoted to the development of e-government in Ukraine, while the second was discussed urban IT initiatives. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/6d0/3f5/351/6d03f535141e4a2995b61991a15fa40a.jpg"><br><br>  The first session was attended by representatives of government agencies and socially active IT-community. <br>  E-government is a topic relevant for Ukraine.  The introduction of e-government will simplify the provision of information and the provision of public services to citizens, businesses, other branches of government and government officials, in which the personal interaction between the state and the applicant is minimized and information technology is used as much as possible.
