  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Life is a game?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"> Prologue <br>  In this article, I would like to consider some issues related to games in a historical perspective.  Of course, I am most worried about the current state of affairs in the game-industry. <br><br>  Let's start with a look in depth.  What exactly encourages people to play, and why does a reasonable person need such a frivolous at first glance need?  We will try to understand the motives of the person playing, and as conclusions we will try to dissect the imperishable superhit “The Sims”, considering the game in the context of its psychological foundations.  Was success determined by Will Wright’s cool calculation, or was the development team just lucky? <br><br>  Plato in the “Laws” calls man “some kind of fictional toy of God,” the purpose of which life is to “live, play” in the “finest games” to which he referred sacrifices, songs, dances and battles with enemies.  In “Politics”, the term “Game” means all the arts “directed exclusively to our pleasure” - painting, decoration, music.  Shakespeare said that life is a theater, and we are only actors in it.  However, they say, even the Sumerians came up with this.

      Whether we want to know it or not, it does not matter: the games we play, exist independently of us.  Everyone is involved, even if he does not think about it. <br><br>  Among specialists, two points of view on the nature of games are best known: <br><br>  * One of the opinions suggests that the toy responds to some unchanging natural features of the child (instincts leaving the evolutionary layer of human nature) and is in no connection with the life of society and the life of the child in society. <br>  * According to another opinion, the game in its content goes back to the work of adults.  From which it follows that a toy cannot be anything other than the reproduction in one way or another of a simplified, generalized and schematized form of objects from the life and work of society adapted to the characteristics of children of a given age. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/b9f/fd5/346/b9ffd5346a866895465845074e5305e7.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><a name="habracut"></a>  Where did two so diametrically opposite opinions come from?  Consider both points of view consistently. <br><br>  Historical parallels: Why did the games need ancestors? <br>  In the article "Instinctive programs and the path to success," I attempted to consider the role of instincts in shaping the behavior of humans and animals.  Often a person does not realize that at certain moments on the unconscious level, the mechanisms of instinctive programs that determine his behavior are activated.  The article mentioned indicated some ways to use instinctive programs for the needs of the gaming industry. <br><br>  Let's try to make a historical excursion, relying, if possible, on reliable sources.  Considering the fact that the prehistoric epoch has been studied rather superficially, special attention will be paid to modern parallels.  Note that the most valuable sources of information about the Stone Age are the tribes and ethnic groups that are at the primitive level of development.  Many interesting observations about the life of primitive tribes can be found in the works of the great travelers and researchers of past centuries. <br><br>  S.P.  Krasheninnikov, describing his journey through Kamchatka (1737-1741), notes about the Koryaks: “The people are more rewarding of this people that, although they love their children too much, they teach the works to the works;  what for the sake of them and keep them no better than serfs, they send firewood and water, order them to carry weights, graze deer herds, and the like, to do. ” <br><br>  V.F.  Zuev, who visited the Ob peoples in 1771-1772, wrote about the children of the Ostyaks and Samoyeds: “From the young age, the little guys have long been accustomed to bear any difficulty, as can be seen from their rough living, which in no case leads them in regret.  It is true to say that this people was born to bear the labors of insufferable things and, indeed, if they had not become accustomed to this, they would have had little hope of seeing the sons of the big helpers themselves and of the works of the amazing helpers.  Only the boy will have little idea, the mother or the nanny is nothing but an embarrassment, like a squash of sheer bowstring, and when he begins to walk, his father will cook him and onions.  I have seen little of these guys in my passage through the Ostyak yurts, who would wander in the simple evening time between the game without a bow, but usually they shoot trees or something on the ground.  There are ezi around their yurts, constipation there;  and it seems as if their toys already foreshadowed their future life.  And is there any way to look at the river, through some river made, it is impossible to see that someday the old men with the lazy people would sit there, except for the little guys, and the big ones would swim along the rivers or with seines, or with caldan and perimeter, where it is too small or unable to, or not understand, it is impossible to keep up ”. <br><br>  The famous Russian researcher of the Papuan Papuans life.  Miklouho-Maclay, who has lived in their midst for many years, writes about Papuan children: “Children are usually cheerful, crying and crying infrequently, the father and sometimes the mother treat them very well, although the mother usually treats children less gently than the father.  In general, the Papuans love for children is very strong.  I have even seen toys in them that they are not often found among savages, namely, something like boxers, small boats that children let on the water, and many other toys.  But early on the boy accompanies his father to the plantation, wandering through the woods and fishing trips.  Already in childhood, a child will practically learn his future activities and, as a boy, he becomes serious and cautious in handling.  I often had to see a comical scene, how a little boy of about four seriously lit a fire, carried firewood, washed dishes, helped his father to clean the fruits, and then suddenly jumped up, ran to his mother, squatting for some work, grabbed her by the chest and , despite the resistance, began to suck.  Here, the custom of breastfeeding is widespread for a very long time. ” <br><br>  Pointing to a very common love among the natives for teaching others, Miklouho-Maclay explains its origin in this way: “This is noticeable even in children: many times young children, six or seven years old, showed me how they do this or that.  This is due to the fact that parents teach children to practical life very early;  so that, being still very young, they had already looked more closely and even learned more or less all the arts and actions of adults, even those that do not suit their age at all.  Children play little: the boys play is throwing sticks like spears, archery, and as soon as they make little progress, they use them in practical life.  I saw very small boys, spending whole hours by the sea, trying to get from a bow to some fish.  The same thing happens with girls, and even more so because they start to do housework earlier and are made assistants to their mothers. ” <br><br>  In the prehistoric era, the division of labor was only in its infancy, man hardly distinguished himself from the world of nature, from the midst of his fellow tribesmen.  Hunting, gathering, satisfaction of spirits, procreation - everything was an inseparable part of a single stream of life. <br><br>  All the knowledge possessed by the tribe, had to be transferred to the younger generation in the shortest possible time.  Naturally, the accumulated experience was transmitted to children through games.  Education was aimed at the early training of social work for the good of the tribe, which is understandable with an average life expectancy not exceeding 25-30 years. <br><br>  Many Soviet researchers of the peoples of the Far North also point to the early inclusion of children in adult work and special training for work.  So, A.G.  Bazanov and N.G.  Kazan write: “From a very early age, the Mansi children are drawn into the fishing industry.  They barely walk, and their parents are already taking them into the boat.  And as soon as they start to grow up, small oars are often made for them, they are trained to control the boat, they are taught to live in the river. ”  In his other work, A.G.  Bazanov writes: “The Vogul child was only able to knock at the age of 5-6 years, and he was already running around the yurt with a bow and arrow, hunting birds, developing accuracy in himself.  The hunter wants to be.  From 7-8 years old Vogul children begin to gradually take to the forest.  In the forest, they learn how to find a squirrel, wood grouse, how to handle a dog, where and how to set sloptsy, chirkans, traps.  If a native man cuts down poles for slops, then his little son adjusts his settings to the slopes, loosens the soil, arranges a bait, puts a sandpiper, pebbles, berries here. ”  Children, even the youngest, are passionate hunters and, coming to school, have dozens of squirrels and chipmunks on their account.  A.G.  Bazanov, describing fishing, very well noticed the basic principle of education in these conditions: “There were four adults and the same number of small children ... We came out on a sandy cape speaking in sharp tongues and, standing in two rows, began to choose a net.  In the middle between us were the kids.  They also clung to the edges of the seine tanned arms and helped to transfer it to the boat. ”  “My guide is Zyryanin,” continues A.G.  Bazanov, - someone from the guys shouted: "Do not push under your feet."  The old vogul glared at him, shook his head.  And then he remarked: “It’s not wrong, it’s impossible.  Let the children do everything we do. "  G. Startsev points out that “already at the age of 6-7 years, children are taught to rule the reindeer and catch them with lasso“. <br><br>  S.N.  Stebnitsky, describing the life of Koryak children, writes: “The independence of children is especially evident in economic life.  There are a number of business sectors and jobs, the execution of which rests entirely on children. "  “S.N.  Stebnitsky - is also harvesting firewood.  In any frost and bad weather, the boy must, harnessed the dogs remaining at home, sometimes go ten kilometers behind the wood. ”  “Girls,” continues S.N.  Stebnitsky - enter into all this work effortlessly.  At first they will give a shred, a serrated blunt knife, a broken needle, then they will take up the real one not skillfully, then they will acquire skills and unnoticed by themselves will be drawn into the age-old female shoulder strap. ” <br><br>  In former times, the game itself was an imitation of the behavior of adults and the fact that by 5–6 years old the child had an N-th number of trophies on account, in a sense, blurred the line between the game and the real hunt.  The beginning of the game, therefore, was a way to involve the child in real life. <br><br>  If we briefly describe the realities of that time, then, in my opinion, the phrase “Life is a game” is more than appropriate. <br><br>  There is a definite tendency - the more developed a society, or the more successful a family where a child is brought up, the more time is given to him for entry into adulthood.  And today, much has changed: for example, child labor is a crime against society, and the barrier of adulthood has shifted to a much older age. <br><br>  M. Kosven, speaking of the people of Cuba, writes: “Children stay with their parents and follow them in search of food for up to 10-12 years.  From this age both boys and girls are considered to be independent and able to organize their own destiny and their future.  From this point on they begin to wear a dressing covering the genitals for the first time.  During parking, they build a separate hut next to the parent.  But they are already looking for food on their own and eat separately.  The bond between parents and children gradually weakens, and often the children are soon separated and begin to live independently in the forest. ” <br><br>  Let me make some intermediate conclusions on the topic. <br><br>  In antiquity, games were imitative in nature, which in the shortest possible time allowed to raise a completely independent unit out of a child, capable not only of feeding itself, but also, if necessary, of his family. <br><br>  After humanity has moved to a settled way of life, it became possible to make supplies for a longer time.  Crafts appeared, which required considerable time and some talent for training.  These circumstances gradually increased the age of the child’s entry into adulthood, and the boiling energy that does not have the possibility of practical application in the child will always find an opportunity to spill out.  Today, it spills over with a variety of social role-playing games that children of our time prefer to play. <br><br>  Continuing the thought, I would like to draw attention to the fact that the entry of a child-young man into adulthood is always and everywhere associated with the onset of sexual activity and the possibility of creating a full-fledged family.  It should not be forgotten that the family is a very specific obligation, which is often equally borne by both men and women.  And if yesterday a man was a breadwinner, and a woman was the keeper of the hearth, then today these barriers do not exist. <br><br>  Today's society is moving away from the old "games" intended for early learning, i.e.  engaging the younger generation in adult life.  Imitation games have receded far into the background, and social role-playing games have taken their place. <br><br>  Thus, we substantiated the first point of view: in the past, games in the past allowed a person to quickly learn phenotypic (acquired) knowledge, due to which the individual was able to survive in the realities of that era.  And the games allowed to achieve the necessary in the shortest possible time. <br><br>  The current stage of development <br>  In the modern world (in developed countries) food is no longer a problem.  To eat and dress, there is no need, like in the prehistoric era, to go hunting, and from animal hides to make clothes that functionally must protect against natural adversity, and not be a sign of belonging to a particular class.  It must be said, however, that clothing at a rather early stage has become an indicator of the owner’s success, and today one of the main criteria for a person’s success is money (they are usually power). <br><br>  From the above it follows a direct conclusion that children now most of all should want to become persons involved in Forbes magazine.  In part, this is the case ... I do not want to run ahead, I will try to be consistent.  What are the kids playing now? <br><br>  Adults usually think that playing for a child is a fun, easy way to spend your free time.  But this is far from the case.  In the game, the child develops, and his meaningful play activity is quite comparable with the serious occupation of adults.  During the game, the child acquires many invaluable qualities: it develops dexterity, observation, imagination, memory.  The game stimulates a variety of abilities: the ability to compare, combine, reflect, analyze.  How important the game is for the child, can be judged if only because in modern psychotherapy for children there is a special section called “game therapy”.  A child with whom they play a lot from an early age quickly becomes independent, because with time he himself begins to invent activities and games for himself. <br><br>  Here are some numbers: a 5–7-year-old child can be in a calm state (without movements) for no more than 15 minutes, an 8–10-year-old can concentrate for no more than 20 minutes.  Therefore, summing up all the really useful time that you can devote to study, we get about 6 hours per day for 6-year-old children, and 3.5 hours for 8-year-olds.  That is why the well-known proverb “time is a good time for fun” is not quite suitable for children.  Consequently, children's games can not be neglected.  The more creativity there will be in them, the faster and more fully the child will develop. <br><br>  At this stage of development, there are simultaneously two changes in the nature of education and the process of forming a child as a member of society.  The first of these is that some general abilities that are necessary for mastering any tools (development of visual-motor coordination, small and precise movements, dexterity, etc.) are found out, and society creates special objects for the exercise of these qualities.  These are either degraded, simplified and lost their initial functions, reduced tools of labor, which served at the previous stage for direct training, or even special items made by adults for children.  Exercises with these items, which cannot be called toys, are shifted to an earlier age.  The second change is the appearance of a symbolic toy.  With her help, children recreate those areas of life and production, in which they are not yet included, but to which they aspire. <br><br>  For me, the very fact of the evolution of toys is interesting - from a real weapon that killed or was used in everyday life to objects with a purely symbolic role.  Although functionally they could not change (a sports bow kills no worse than a combat one). <br><br>  Role play arises in the course of the historical development of society as a result of a change in the child’s place in the system of social relations.  Role play is social in its origin, in its nature.  Its appearance is not connected with the action of any internal, innate instinctive forces, but with well-defined social conditions of the child’s life in society. <br><br>  The phenomenon of "The Sims" - random success or proper use of the human need to play? <br>  Kids games are a must.           .  ,      ,    ,    ,     , , , .       .   — ,  ,   .  ,      ,       . <br><br>    ,   ? ,  ,      , .    ,              .       ,    (). <br><br>  ,     ,    .           .&lt; <br><br>  : „        ,     ,       ,    “», «», «», «    », «»,         .  —   -    ,    ". <br><br> ,    ,      , , ,     . <br><br>  ,             ,      ()   ,       .  «»     . <br><br>  : «     , ,      , ,        ,       (recognition-hunger —          —  ,  ,    —    )». <br><br> «      ,               — »" —      ", —  . <br><br>       « — »  «The Sims». <br><br>         ,     . <br><br>              «     »,  ,    «Black &amp; White»   (Peter Molyneux).       . ,       (Will Wright)  ,          . <br><br>      , «SimAnt»,     -  .
