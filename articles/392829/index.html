Recall: MEGA Accelerator is a project of IKEA Centers Russia, managing MEGA shopping centers throughout Russia, to search for innovative, unusual and cool ideas to improve consumer experience in the MEGA shopping center and beyond. <br><br>  March 11 was the opening of coworking PO2PT.  Our correspondent went to the event to see everything with his own eyes, to get acquainted with the teams that passed the selection and tell Geektimes readers about everything.  Photos of coworking and not only under the cut. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  <font color="228b22">Facts and figures</font> </h2><br>  As planned by the organizer, a special meaning is put into the abbreviation PO2PT:

    <ul><li>  Port - start, the starting point for the departure of a large navigation. </li><li>  The port is a transport hub that connects cities, different people, different spheres of life. </li><li>  Port - the way / place to transfer information, experience. </li><li>  O2 - the formula of the oxygen molecule. </li><li>  Coworking PO2PT on the 15th floor - high, fresh, spacious, airy. </li></ul><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b10/0ad/f2b/b100adf2bf084d8dbf4a60a07fce6276.jpeg"><br><br>  We would, perhaps, add another hidden meaning for the Russian-language outline - software (software) 2 (to, for) ReTail - PO2PT.  After all, it is in this coworking that teams that doom retail and shopping malls for a technological future work and develop. <br><br>  The business center in which the co-working is located was built in 2008 - by the standards of the builders the building is quite young, and by the standards of the tenants it is already inhabited and endured all the childhood diseases of the new buildings.  What you need! <br><br>  Despite the fact that the business center is located 3 km outside the Moscow Ring Road, its location is extremely successful.  It is very easy to get here: in the morning everyone goes to Moscow, so the lane to the region is free, in the evening - on the contrary.  This is convenient for everyone, but, above all, for residents of the North-West of Moscow and the Moscow region.  Now, freelancers, startups, young businessmen can not waste time trying to get to co-working or a tiny office in the city center.  Hired jobs in a cafe, you can also leave, good, the prices for rent to this have. <br><br>  Rent a place in coworking can any individual or company, prices do not bite: <br><br><ul><li>  1 day - 450 rubles </li><li>  7 days - 2 500 rubles </li><li>  month - 9 000 rubles </li></ul><br>  For comparison, the price of a month of renting co-working in major cities of Russia (except Moscow and St. Petersburg) ranges from 5,000 to 12,000 rubles.  At the same time, in most cases coworkings are located not in large business centers, but in buildings with a non-cost of buying and renting housing. <br><br>  PO2PT occupies the last, 15th, floor of the glass high-rise of Khimki Business Park.  The co-working area is 700 square meters.  In addition to the huge workspace there is a parking for cars and an open roof terrace.  Can you imagine summer sunsets and views from there? <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/3dc/5ea/e67/3dc5eae670244c05bc7c3cc8469e2b2f.jpeg"><br><br>  <i><font color="999999">View of the parking lot from the 15th floor</font></i> <br><br>  The building itself is a triumph of glass and concrete, but not to which residents of Russian cities are accustomed.  Light, seemingly almost weightless design resembles a mosaic of bright clean windows: the architecture of the building is based on panoramic windows.  In our northern latitudes, this solution allows us to receive our portion of daylight even in the most severe, inclement weather.  And it always has a positive effect on health and mood. <br><br><h2>  <font color="d9d507">Welcome to the virtual tour</font> </h2><br>  Scientists from the University of Exeter conducted an experiment and found that if you decorate the interior of the office with plants, paintings, photographs, the staff will work on average 32% more productive.  Interior solutions are especially critical when it comes to open space.  Employee dissatisfaction arises from the wrong light, the smell of food, noise and constrained surroundings.  Improperly organized, uncomfortable workplace can not only make you quit, but also leads to health problems: eyesight, spine, nervous system.  That is why, working on the co-working of PO2PT, we set a goal to ensure maximum control, ergonomics and, most importantly, care for the health of residents. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d56/6a1/e1e/d566a1e1e96245b8a2a80fa742824098.jpeg"><br><br>  <i><font color="999999">The meeting room</font></i> <br><br>  Inside the co-working is designed to match the architecture - it is easy to breathe in space, the glance does not ‚Äústumble‚Äù against corners and walls.  Laconic and functional office furniture is perfectly combined with positive multi-colored ottomans, pear chairs and sofas.  The floor covering provides additional noise insulation and pleasantly resilient under your feet - here you just don‚Äôt want to sit and walk without replaceable shoes. <br><br>  Only at first glance, bright elements seem to be just a design decision - in fact, this is an excellent tool for switching attention, which psychologically lies at the basis of concentration.  In general, when developing a design concept for a room, a lot of attention was paid to interaction within the space: after all, co-working implies communication and the work of completely unfamiliar representatives of different fields of activity.  For their positive communication, the co-working space and activities should work to unite, but not merge. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/7d3/ac9/d80/7d3ac9d80f414928bffdfd5f8d6eb54c.jpeg"><br><br>  <i><font color="999999">Space lecture</font></i> <br><br>  Residents of PO2PT do not spend the whole day in one chair, joining the table and the monitor - they can work even though they are lying upside down.  To do this, in the co-working space there are many nice and cozy corners.  A change of position in the process of work helps to prevent pathological changes in the spine and blood stasis.  And this is the prevention of at least half of the typical diseases of an office worker. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/82f/1ab/9c2/82f1ab9c246b442e9bec301a7d3c5880.jpeg"><br><br>  <i><font color="999999">Lobby and seating area</font></i> <br><br>  High backs and soft seats of chairs make the workplace as comfortable as possible.  Luminaires attached to the boards allow each user to choose the most appropriate lighting option for eye comfort.  Wireless Internet is available for each workplace, which guarantees users excellent speed even when working with large amounts of information. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ae0/e71/4ac/ae0e714ac49f4cf8b51c269b4725b816.jpeg"><br><br>  The organizers of the co-working sought to arrange space in such a way that a person would be comfortable to spend the whole day here.  That is why there are opportunities for recreation and changing activities (play area, roof terrace and by the pond).  So, if you wish, you can get distracted by outdoor games or make a small stretch in one of the spacious rooms.  To switch attention and relieve stress (the work has not been canceled!) In co-working there is a game room with XBOX ONE and table football. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/edf/18c/382/edf18c38280540f885dc2051eceeb48b.jpeg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/9f8/9cb/fd6/9f89cbfd62e0485b8e2738321cf3b79e.jpeg"><br><br>  <i><font color="999999">Negotiation room</font></i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/305/ffd/e1f/305ffde1f5be4388a063c2bd55ce0cf0.jpeg"><br><br>  <i><font color="999999">Creative space</font></i> <br><br>  Different people gather in coworking, with their own interests and tasks, but each of them can start the day with playing table tennis, take a shower in clean showers, have a cup of freshly brewed coffee in the dining room or in his place.  Isn't that the morning of a fruitful working day?  Here and Monday is not terrible. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/5e8/fb2/ef1/5e8fb2ef1ea34b7bae8dc3ae30c09fcc.jpeg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/827/94e/1a4/82794e1a4d494514acaeefa0b70a9566.jpeg"><br><br>  How many office disputes flare up because of lovers to talk on the phone!  In co-working, this problem is acute - after all, while some residents silently write the program code, others actively communicate with customers, customers or other remote colleagues by the nature of their activities.  The solution was found: the space is equipped with special booths for talking on the phone.  It is checked: inside there is a complete sound insulation and no decrease in the signal level of the cellular communication, as it sometimes happens in office corridors and recreation. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/363/038/4b4/3630384b47f74f3f9b5d9b6d752ccd78.jpeg"><br><br>  Not the comfort of a single person alive.  You should never forget about self-development, especially since the inhabitants of coworking are creative, focused and ready for constant intensive growth.  After all, something made them abandon the cozy-swampy office amenities and become freer, more independent, stronger.  That is why in the evenings in coworking interesting educational lectures are held, which serve not only as a source of new information, but also inspire. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/856/82f/e60/85682fe600b94462adc015079fc6c0a0.png"><br><br>  <i><font color="999999">Lecture in coworking</font></i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/5d0/e42/fbd/5d0e42fbd61041c987fff9ef6399e844.png"><br><br>  <i><font color="999999">Advisor to the Rector of the University.</font></i>  <i><font color="999999">Lobachevsky on innovation, Kendrick White.</font></i>  <i><font color="999999">He has worked in Russia since 1992 and believes that Russia is an ideal country for innovation.</font></i>  <i><font color="999999">Over the past 20 years, Russia has gone through an evolutionary path for which the United States took 200 years.</font></i>  <i><font color="999999">It is difficult to see being here, but simply from the outside - Russia is a country of innovators.</font></i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/5da/413/7b7/5da4137b7caa4758bc742b06d4065e25.png"><br><br>  Here he is, a brand new coworking.  No matter how beautiful the office is, sooner or later you get tired of office walls, of monotony and severity.  Not without reason, the largest companies like Google and Facebook have filled their offices with the most incredible devices for leisure, food and entertainment of employees.  It seems that sometimes it comes to the extreme - and all these chips begin to distract from work.  There is no such thing in co-working - here there is a sense of style and measure in everything.  It seems to us that this should be the ideal working atmosphere. <br><br><h2>  <font color="ff0000">Resident co-working</font> </h2><br>  After such an acquaintance, it is time to introduce several resident coworking - the selected members of MEGA Accelerator.  They filled the space with the sound of keys, voices, pleasant jokes, and most importantly - ideas. <br><br><ol><li>  Guaranakam - the project gives information about the behavior of visitors in the mall. </li><li>  Raid - the project analyzes the loyalty index. </li><li>  <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ilovedonate">iLoveDonate</a> - customer loyalty program based on charity </li><li>  Chatferst - chat bots, leading a dialogue with the buyer in the human language. </li><li>  Rocketboard - a system of forming individual offers to guests of a shopping center. </li><li>  Surfancy - the solution allows you to turn any surface into a sensory one and explore the behavior of consumers. </li><li>  Kvini is a mobile robot consultant. </li><li>  Nobelmart - e-commerce program. </li><li>  Instashow - integrates customers with the brand in social networks and allows it to express its attitude to the brand directly. </li><li>  Texel - 3D model allows customers to try on things right in the application. </li></ol><br>  We will tell more about the teams and lecture topics in the following posts in the MEGA Accelerator blog posts on <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/mega_accelerator/">Habr√©</a> and <a href="https://megamozg.ru/company/mega_accelerator/">Megamind</a> . <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/33c/7ee/49e/33c7ee49ef9645c88370d691b7d5f443.jpeg"></div><br>  The teams will take part in the accelerator program, which consists of three parts: <br><br><ol><li>  The theoretical part - familiarity with international experience. </li><li>  The practical part - for each project a plan and goals are formed. </li><li>  Questions to experts MEGA Accelerator </li></ol><br>  But the main thing that participants need to understand at this stage is that they are already winners.  A serious selection missed only 5% of the projects in the accelerator and 5% in the incubator.  This is a tougher selection than at Stanford.  If you have passed such a selection, then your idea has already fired and you are sure to launch the project - but you can‚Äôt relax, you have to go to success along the marked road. <br><br>  <i><b><font color="42aaff">We wish the teams good luck!</font></b></i> <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/3bc/993/c44/3bc993c44afc4beea79faf48feb28ffd.jpeg"></div><br>  Perhaps the most important secret of entrepreneurial success of the majority of Russian business is yet to be learned.  This secret can be shocking - there is no right opinion, the right point of view and a ready-made recipe for a thriving company.  Look at all the organizations and even countries that have found ‚Äúthe only true doctrine‚Äù - sooner or later they flew into a ditch of business or history.  It is important to be able to listen, evaluate, learn, think critically and not be afraid to build one‚Äôs own on the best of others, because experience is given for this.  One should not be afraid of abandoning ideas, experimenting, and turning to experts and colleagues ‚Äî dialogue gives rise to steep insights.  This is networking, coworking.  Not the one that is the premise, but the one whose spirit of cooperation, healthy competition and intensive growth. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/392829/">https://habr.com/ru/post/392829/</a></p>
