The thing is that a few months ago, the so-called “Slow Media Manifesto” was created and published in Germany.  This manifesto was the impetus for the adoption of a new concept of media, which greatly disturbed the Western media. <br><br>  Circles on water are beginning to appear in our country too, so I hasten to familiarize the Habra community with this topic.  Perhaps some of you have already read the Manifesto, and in the original, and if so, I invite you to join the discussion.

    <a name="habracut"></a>  So what is Slow Media?  This concept is a kind of opposition to the information boom, in which we consume a huge amount of information, most of which is absolutely useless.  You can compare the concept of “Slow Media” with “slow food”, the antipode of “fast food”.  Here we see a symbiosis of "consumer" and "product" in which the "product" is carefully balanced and contains extremely useful elements, and the "consumer" chews it all slowly, trying to assimilate all the useful contents. <br><br>  So, “slow media” allows us not to mindlessly consume information, but to carefully select and prepare it.  “Slow Media”, in the opinion of the creators of the concept, is hospitable, friendly and very fond of sharing information and content. <br><br>  Let's look at the main provisions of the "Manifesto", proclaiming a new type of media resources.  After reading all the provisions, let's think about what resources from those you know fit the concept of “slow media”.  It is also interesting to find out if, in your opinion, Habr himself fits this concept? <br><br>  1. <b>“Slow Media” is a contribution to sustainable development</b> .  In this case, sustainability is associated with raw materials, processes and working conditions, which serve as the basis for the production of media products.  Neither over-exploitation, nor low salaries, coupled with unlimited commercialization, can serve to create sustainable media.  At the same time, sustainable consumption is one of the criteria for “Slow Media”; <br><br>  2. <b>“Slow Media” promotes mono-task</b> .  This type of media requires a complete concentration of users, in this case, superficial consumption of information is impossible.  As well as the production of good food, which requires the concentration of all the senses of both the cook and the consumers, “Slow Media” should be perceived by attentive readers. <br><br>  3. <b>The goal of Slow Media is excellence</b> .  This is not perfectionism, but a real desire to continuously improve its product.  Not necessarily “Slow Media” should offer something new for the market.  More important is the improvement of the reliability of the interface, its availability and convenient functionality. <br><br>  4. <b>“Slow Media” creates tangible quality</b> .  In other words, Slow Media strives to meet the highest standards of production, design and content.  They differ from fast media in a premium interface or aesthetic design. <br><br>  5. <b>“Slow Media” promotes the concept of “prosumers</b> . <b>”</b>  Prosumers, unlike consumer products, know what they choose, know what and how they want to create and consume.  It is “Slow Media” that is the impetus for the development of new ideas and active actions of prosumers.  This allows you to oust mindless, passive consumers from the media field. <br><br>  6. <b>"Slow media" are discursive</b> , they go towards dialogue.  They cooperate with competitors who know how to conduct a dialogue.  It is very important not only to be able to speak, but also to be able to listen.  In this context, "slow" means going towards, thoughtful, the one that goes towards, is able to accept someone else's point of view. <br><br>  7. <b>“Slow Media” - social media</b> .  Slow Media gathers communities around it.  The authors of such media debate with their audience, such media actively promote various points of view. <br><br>  8. <b>“Slow Media” respects its own readers</b> , is friendly to them and understands the irony that users in some cases show.  Slow Media will never impose its own opinion. <br><br>  9. <b>“Slow Media” is distributed through recommendations</b> , and not through advertising.  “Slow Media” will never “crush” across all possible channels. <br><br>  10. <b>“Slow Media” is timeless</b> .  In other words, this type of media is always relevant, these are long-lived resources that have been around for decades.  The quality of such media is improving over time. <br><br>  11. <b>“Slow Media” radiates aura</b> .  Users of such resources feel something special when interacting with Slow Media.  Such resources, despite the standard production methods, are unique. <br><br>  12. <b>“Slow Media” is progressive, not reactionary</b> : “Slow Media” depends on technological advances and on the network structure of society.  Despite the acceleration of all spheres of life, "Slow Media" deliberately not in a hurry, this is the key to survival.  “Slow Media” does not oppose the high speed of various resources, such as Twitter and blogs, they use their advantages. <br><br>  13. <b>“Slow Media” tries to focus on quality</b> , both in terms of production and content perception.  Mastery in general cultural problems, such as sources of criticism, classification and evaluation of information resources, are becoming increasingly important in increasing the availability of information. <br><br>  14. <b>“Slow Media” requires trust</b> .  It is clear that certain time should pass until Slow Media gain such trust.  Behind Slow Media are real, real people, and we can feel it. <br><br>  As we see, the topic is really very important, it is clear that not only the Western media should be concerned about this concept.  Let's try to understand the discussion and try to accept this? <br><br>  By the way, if anyone is interested in reading the source, the Manifesto itself, here <a href="http://en.slow-media.net/manifesto">it is</a> . <br><br>  What do you think, habrovchane? </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/288796/">https://habr.com/ru/post/288796/</a></p>
