This is how technology gets cheaper.  Although I have no regrets and even decided to write a review about this little monster.  Who cares - I ask under the cat.  <b>Caution, traffic at 784 KB.</b>  <b>:)</b> <br><br><img src="http://pikucha.ru/175237/wd.jpg" alt="image"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  You cannot warm your hands from this hard drive - that‚Äôs a fact.  At night, he will not wake you up, as he is practically silent.  But data can store, and perfectly fulfills this function.  And it is also quite small, and not too heavy (compared to the other 2 TB external disks). <br>  Well, let's learn more about it.

    <h4>  Specifications </h4><br><table><tbody><tr><td>  <b>Title</b> </td><td>  WDH1CS20000 </td></tr><tr><td>  <b>Ruler</b> </td><td>  My Book Home Edition </td></tr><tr><td>  <b>The size</b> </td><td>  2 TB (actually 1.81 TB) </td></tr><tr><td>  <b>Buffer size</b> </td><td>  16 mb </td></tr><tr><td>  <b>Rotational speed</b> </td><td>  7200 rpm </td></tr><tr><td>  <b>Average access time</b> </td><td>  8.9 ms </td></tr><tr><td>  <b>Interfaces</b> </td><td>  USB, eSATA, FireWire x2 </td></tr><tr><td>  <b>Dimensions</b> </td><td>  54x166x137 mm </td></tr><tr><td>  <b>Weight</b> </td><td>  1.15 kg </td></tr></tbody></table><br><br><h4>  Equipment </h4><br>  The box is quite beautiful and not heavy (not more than 1.5 kg).  Inside, in a plastic container, are: <br><br>  - 2 TB hard drive <br>  - USB cable <br>  - Firewire cable <br>  - Network adapter and adapter <br>  - Instruction <br>  - A small reminder to the user <br><br>  As I saw all the contents, immediately began to call the store.  I thought that I forgot to put an eSATA cable.  After all, there were cables for USB and FireWire, but not for eSATA.  It turned out (much to my chagrin) that it should be so.  I had to run to the nearest computer store and buy an eSATA cable.  Mentally damning the company Western Digital, their hard drives, employees, and all that is possible up to 5 knees, I ran back and forth in the rain, and purchased a cable.  It has a length of 50 cm, and it costs 235 rubles.  Almost 5 rubles per centimeter, robbery, what to say.  :) <br><br><img src="http://pikucha.ru/175133/SNC01111.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  From the software included (all software is on the hard disk): <br><br>  <b>WD Anywhere Backup</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/4cf/d7d/189/4cfd7d18927f51c63e79c91374321447.jpg" alt="image"><br>  As the name implies, the program for creating backups.  There is a data encryption function. <br>  Convenient utility, you can minimize to tray and ask to eat less resources.  What is surprising, obeys. <br><br>  <b>Memeo autosync</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/ac1/9d8/501/ac19d8501805a2c13b2c21dd79818b6f.jpg" alt="image"><br>  As, again, as the name implies - a program to synchronize. <br>  It can encrypt data as well as create flexible synchronization plans and auto-sync. <br><br>  <b>Google software</b> <br><br>  Includes <b>Google Desktop</b> , <b>Toolbar</b> and <b>Picasa</b> . <br>  The first can be used to search for files on a computer after it has them indexed. <br>  About Picasa nothing special to tell, a sort of "mini-photoshop." <br>  Allows you to remove the red-eye effect, adjust the contrast and brightness, as well as add some effects. <br>  Well, toolbar can block ads and auto-fill forms.  You can put, for IE, for example. <br><br>  Very upset that all the programs in English.  Care about Russian users is not felt.  Although, in general, the programs are convenient and quite useful. <br><br><h4>  Appearance </h4><br>  By itself, the hard disk is very beautiful.  Do not be ashamed to put next to a laptop on the table or show friends. <br>  A disk indicator shows when data is being read or written.  If there is no disk access, the indicator just lights up. <br><br><img src="http://pikucha.ru/175089/hard1.png"><br>  <i>Size relative to the stick</i> <br><br><img src="http://pikucha.ru/175143/SNC01065.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <i>Morse code top and back vents</i> <br><br><img src="http://pikucha.ru/175153/SNC01081.jpg"><br>  <i>2 FireWire connectors, then busy eSATA port, free USB and power adapter connector</i> <br><br>  Also, at the back there is a Kensington lock slot - so that if they steal it, then along with the table or any other place to which you attach the drive with a steel cable.  The case, by the way, is shockproof and specially designed to protect the hard drive from shocks.  This feature has not yet been verified, it is necessary to believe the developers of the word. <br><br><h4>  Measurements </h4><br>  Considering that there is only one disk, it is not necessary to expect high speeds.  No matter when 2 disks in RAID 0 are combined.  But to download / upload to DC ++ / torrents such speeds is enough.  And not just that, by the way.  I was able to watch an HD movie weighing about 15 GB and simultaneously distributed in DC ++ and torrents, the speed was quite enough.  However, it does not only depend on the disk. <br><br>  The tests took place when connected via eSATA program <b>HD Tune Pro 3.50</b> . <br>  The values, unfortunately, do not coincide with the stated ones (access time, for example).  Perhaps due to the fact that a couple of days after the purchase, I had already managed to score about 1 TB on the disk and continue my attempts until now. <br><br><img src="http://pikucha.ru/175182/test1.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  As you can see from the screenshot, the CPU does not use the disk at all.  Tested 3 times, always writes "-1.0%". <br><br><img src="http://pikucha.ru/175183/test2.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Good, but not perfect performance.  However, it suits me. <br><br><h4>  Price </h4><br>  There are quite a few hard disks on 2 TB, with eSATA and in order not to be ashamed to put on the table.  At prices this disc is one of the most reasonable options, with a good value for money.  Personally, he cost me 8577 rubles.  + 235 rubles.  I paid for the eSATA cable (see above).  Total 8812 rubles., Quite profitable (I live in St. Petersburg).  In the rest of the stores where I called, the integrity of the packaging was compromised somewhere, somewhere there was an ‚ÄúOEM version‚Äù, without packaging.  There is, however, a wonderful shop in Moscow, where I took a USB flash drive, with a good price for this screw.  But then it would have had to wait for a month or more (at the moment the party is at the border + sending by mail to St. Petersburg, even from Moscow, takes a lot of time). <br><br><h4>  Total </h4><br>  <u>Pros:</u> <br>  - Large volume <br>  - Small size and fairly low weight <br>  - very quiet <br>  - Almost does not heat up (although there is no built-in fan) <br>  - Stylish design <br>  - Good measurements <br>  - A variety of interfaces <br>  - Useful software included <br>  - Reading indicator <br><br>  <u>Minuses</u> <br>  - Lack of eSATA cable (why not complete the device with an eSATA connector with the necessary cable right away, but!?) <br>  - Initially formatted for FAT32 <br>  - Power button in the back (though it is not needed, the hard drive is turned on and off with the laptop) <br>  - There is no support for the Russian language in the programs (and setup, by the way, also in English) <br>  - No direct Ethernet connection <br>  - <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A2%25D0%25B5%25D1%2585%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BB%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B3%25D0%25B8%25D1%258F_SMART">SMART</a> supported but not working <br><br>  As you can see, there are more pros than cons.  Some cons, even had to specifically invent.  Joke.  :) <br>  I am pleased with this acquisition and I hope it will serve me for a long time.  Yes, and a guarantee of 2 years. <br><br>  I apologize for the quality of the photos, I made them from the phone.  I hope you enjoy my 2 TB locker and its review. <br><br>  <b>Thanks for reading!</b> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/71899/">https://habr.com/ru/post/71899/</a></p>
