The <b><a href="https://mobiusconf.com/">Mobius</a></b> mobile development conference, which has been successfully held in St. Petersburg for a long time, will come to Moscow for the first time <b>on November 11</b> .  The need for this is clearly overdue: this spring, conducting the fourth St. Petersburg Mobius, we found that about a third of all viewers turned out to be Muscovites. <br><br>  What can be expected from the first metropolitan Mobius?  The names of the speakers and other details - under the cut.

First, Android and iOS are widely represented in the program (there are also reports on cross-platform development on Mobius, but most are dedicated to native). <br><br>  Secondly, the emphasis on technical specifics for professionals - instead of abstract reasoning, marketing speeches, reports for beginners and the like.  At the same time, the reports vary in complexity (from introducing a certain technology to those who have not worked with it before, to hardcore, which requires deep knowledge from the viewer), and the notation in the program helps to select suitable performances: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/1e0/e8c/fbc/1e0e8cfbc50f4a00a962b6dc6813df22.jpg"><br><br>  Thirdly, the discussion area.  Usually the questions after the report are tightly limited in time: there are a few minutes, and then it is time to free the hall.  In our case, the matter is not limited to this - after each speaker, each speaker moves to a specially designated area, where interested listeners can continue to communicate with him longer. <br><br>  Among the themes of Mobius there will be ‚Äúeternal‚Äù and actual now.  Among the eternal ones that interest us are: <br><br><ul><li>  Design Patterns </li><li>  Architecture (at least Android, where Google recently rolled out the ‚Äúofficial‚Äù <a href="https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/guide.html">approach</a> , at least iOS) </li><li>  "Reactive" </li><li>  Shortening the development cycle (hot redepla on the device, optimizing build scripts, emulators, testing approaches). </li></ul><br><br>  But the ‚Äúfresh‚Äù ones that interest us (if you yourself have something to say about it, see below the section ‚ÄúBecome a speaker‚Äù): <br><br><ul><li>  New Android O </li><li>  Kotlin best practices.  Topics like ‚Äúwhat's new in Kotlin‚Äù and ‚Äúhow the korutins are arranged‚Äù were already widely disclosed - now it is time to learn to write well in it.  Therefore, we are interested in the experience of using Kotlin in production. </li><li>  Similar to Swift best practices.  There have already been quite a few ‚Äútheoretical‚Äù reports about the language, the community is waiting for the analysis of real life examples. </li><li>  Machine Learning: Google announced a lightweight version of TensorFlow for use on a mobile device, but is it so easy to use it now? </li></ul><br><h2>  Speakers </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/6ac/d11/cf6/6acd11cf6ea74d0086090f7e25d43887.jpg"><br><br>  Work on the program is now actively underway, so later the list of speakers will become much longer, and some of those listed below may still fall off.  But according to this preliminary list it is quite possible to make a general impression about what to expect at all: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/c78/7ea/a45/c787eaa452124dd8beb466c677554c3b.jpg" align="left">  <b>Denis Neklyudov</b> (90Seconds) is a ‚Äúveteran‚Äù of the conference and has the honorary status of Google Developer Developer.  This spring, Mobius in St. Petersburg was especially actively talking about architecture - and one of the reasons for this was Denis and Stepan Goncharov‚Äôs presentation ‚ÄúA Modern Approach to the Android Application Architecture‚Äù. <br><br><br><br><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/c09/8be/9d6/c098be9d60c6443cacc8c192c1bac80d.jpg" align="left">  <b>David Gonz√°lez</b> - but this famous android driver, unlike Denis, did not speak at Mobius before.  But with Denis, he is similar in another: firstly, he also has the title of GDE, and secondly, he also talks about architecture to Mobius - it will be interesting to compare their reports. <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/094/7c1/4d7/0947c14d77724ee48dd3d1e5066c7498.jpg" align="left">  <b>Alexander Zimin</b> (Uberchord GmbH) is also a prominent speaker, but not on Android, but on iOS.  The winner of the WWDC 2015 Scholarships program, led the first Swift courses in Russia, the organizer of CocoaHeads Russia - you can transfer his merits for a long time.  We still can not announce the topic of his new report, but we can recall the previous one: on Mobius 2017 Piter, he talked about measuring UX in an iOS application. <br><br><br><br><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/fe0/4c8/157/fe04c815747a4ae48df162cd3ae73510.jpg" align="left">  <b>Matvey Malkov</b> - in 2015, his report on reactive programming for Android was included in the <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/jugru/blog/281551/">top reports of</a> Mobius 2015 according to audience estimates.  In 2016, having developed the topic of reactivity, Matvey was again <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/jugru/blog/320392/">at the top</a> with her, and also made a report on the use of Scala in Android.  He missed Mobius 2017 Piter, but he will be in Moscow - so in 2017 Muscovites were more lucky with him than the Petersburgers. <br><br><br><br><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/4b0/770/1e0/4b07701e019b4da2b93fe19b778170d4.jpg" align="left">  <b>Maxim Sokolov</b> (Avito), whose report ‚ÄúAdvanced Swift Generics - let's move on to &lt;T&gt;‚Äù last year, became a favorite of viewers on the St. Petersburg Mobius.  Now Maxim, while developing the Avito messenger, gained even more experience with Swift - and will share this experience with the new Mobius. <br><br><br><br><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/bec/5ba/01a/bec5ba01a94043c8adc7de7f6fb75b4e.jpeg" align="left">  <b>Aleksander Piotrowski</b> , the Polish speaker who spoke about ConstraintLayout in St. Petersburg, Mobius, was then grateful that we do not mind using this photo of him: ‚ÄúSome conferences, when I send it, ask to send something else.  I don‚Äôt understand why they didn‚Äôt like my forehead? ‚ÄùIn general, we are waiting for Alexander with his forehead in Moscow in the fall, hiding a lot of knowledge about Android. <br><br><br><br><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/884/90f/bef/88490fbef88544c8b7fad8e9f777459c.jpg" align="left">  <b>Igor Kashkut</b> (Badoo) spoke at Mobius twice already (with the themes ‚ÄúThe Leaning Tower of Mobile Development‚Äù and ‚ÄúThe Process of Developing an iOS Application‚Äù), and the second time the audience was significantly more inspired.  Work in Badoo should give a lot of material for the new report in Moscow - we will try so that viewers like it even more. <br><br><br><br><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/3ba/188/50b/3ba18850bcd34344b7b344a75eb30a07.jpg" align="left">  <b>Alexey Denisov</b> (Uberchord GmbH) - last time talked about mutational testing.  We will not let you know the topic of the new speech, but when a speaker appears at the mobile conference, immersed in the world of low-level programming and knowing firsthand about technologies like LLVM, this is interesting anyway. <br><br><br><br><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/bd8/fe8/54a/bd8fe854a9024e8ab313ebcc74e0ad35.jpg" align="left">  <b>Jonathan Levin</b> at Mobius 2017 Piter delivered two reports at once: ‚ÄúIPC: AIDL is not a curse word‚Äù plunged into technical details, and the closing keynote ‚ÄúHow to make a product out of your application‚Äù was intended for everyone.  The audience liked both performances, and it would be foolish not to call Jonathan again.  Now he doesn‚Äôt know exactly his travel schedule and has not yet confirmed participation, but we hope that the loud voice of the community will make Jonathan find time in his busy schedule (and you can contribute to this - for example, in the comments). <br><br><br><h2>  Become a speaker </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/afb/025/a07/afb025a0793041cab289341ad6cfa443.jpg"><br><br>  If you want to see your name in the list of speakers - now is the time <a href="https://mobiusconf.com/cfp/"><b>to submit a report to us</b></a> !  Our strict program committee includes only really good performances in the program, but the same committee helps the speakers bring their promising developments to the right level - so even if you do not have relevant experience, but there is an interesting topic, do not be afraid to apply. <br><br>  And if you have experience, refer to the video recordings of reports that you did earlier, and this will significantly speed up the decision making by the program committee. <br><br>  The main requirement is one: your report should be useful to other developers. <br><br><h2>  Program and Registration </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/833/4b2/7bb/8334b27bb54a44da9278a58c6a4ca2d3.png" align="left">  The conference program will gradually be replenished, and you can monitor its most current status on the <a href="https://mobiusconf.com/">site</a> .  And now the <a href="https://mobiusconf.com/tickets/">sale of tickets</a> is open on this site - and over time, their price will rise, so now you can have time to buy at the most favorable conditions.  We are waiting in November! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/331640/">https://habr.com/ru/post/331640/</a></p>
