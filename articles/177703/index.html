As an example, we can cite services for calculating the cost of delivery, searching for similar products and comparing prices. <br><br>  As you know, Yandex Market plays a very specific role in Russia.  The role of the Center of the Universe, if I may say so.  Therefore, if we decided to create a Russian analogue of one of such applications, we would use the data of Yandex Market.  In general, this is how we did and wrote an <a href="http://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B0%25D1%2580%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B5%25D1%2582-%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B3%25D0%25B0%25D1%2582%25D0%25BE%25D1%2580/edkanhffbhbognfkkdodomkknnceampc%3Fhl%3Dru">application for price comparison</a> . <br><br>  The application is called <a href="http://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B0%25D1%2580%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B5%25D1%2582-%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B3%25D0%25B0%25D1%2582%25D0%25BE%25D1%2580/edkanhffbhbognfkkdodomkknnceampc%3Fhl%3Dru">Market Navigator</a> .  In the Google Chrome store there are so far only a few funny reviews.  No more information about this application anywhere, and this small review will be the first. <a name="habracut"></a>

      I gave the application a maximum rating and wrote a positive review not because I took part in the development, but because: <br><br>  1. It is useful <br>  2. It is free <br>  3. It works <br><br>  Maybe it will seem strange to many, but this is quite enough.  I, as a user, need nothing more.  I understand perfectly well that none of these applications will become revolutionary, will not create a sensation on the Internet, and in general, does not pretend to anything serious.  But if I suddenly want to know how much this thing costs in stores, I just have to press one button and I will get all the necessary information. <br><br>  To be more specific, you should clarify what our application does.  Fortunately, this does not have to write a lot.  The application shows prices in stores for the product you are interested in.  Just ridiculous, isn't it.  Prices are displayed in the form of a list of stores where this product is in stock.  From the application window, you can immediately go to the online store with the lowest price, and immediately to the product page and buy it. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/54a/a2c/9de/54aa2c9de934332f226d8233be8ef115.jpg"><br><br>  There are still such things as product characteristics, product reviews, modifications and shops nearby, although the last 2 tabs are still inactive (Chrome shows version 0.0.8, so it's scary to imagine what will be there for the first stable release). <br><br>  In advance of warning reasonable comments on the topic of duplication of the Yandex Market functional, I remind dear readers that we are all lazy.  I work on the Internet browsing hundreds of pages of stores with prices and descriptions, but I'm stupidly lazy to score every product in Yandex Market.  And <a href="http://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B0%25D1%2580%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B5%25D1%2582-%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B3%25D0%25B0%25D1%2582%25D0%25BE%25D1%2580/edkanhffbhbognfkkdodomkknnceampc%3Fhl%3Dru">Market Navigator</a> shows all the necessary information at once - I personally find it so much more convenient.  By the way, let me remind you once again that the application is completely based on data obtained from Yandex Market (I hope that this is legal). <br><br>  Of course, if I am going to buy plasma for 100K, I will not be lazy and spend more than one hour on Yandex Market, but most often the information is needed very quickly and in a very condensed form.  And here for me there is no more convenient solution than an unknown, accidentally written ‚Äúon the knee‚Äù application. <br><br>  By the way, it seems to me that this situation has recently become the norm in Runet.  Perhaps the reason for this is the general desire of everyone and everyone to Zuckerberg‚Äôs laurels and millions and, as a result, the arrogant disregard for the user's specific and simple tasks.  But this is a topic for the next holivar dispute, but I still would like to receive a diverse and unbiased assessment of a specific application.  By the way, thanks to everyone who somehow helped me get it. <br><br>  From myself I will add another interesting feature.  I don‚Äôt know how useful it is for a wide audience, but I‚Äôll still add my five kopecks.  Despite the fact that the application must be used on the product pages in stores, it works quite well on ordinary sites.  That is, if you read a review, review or topic on the forum (or an article on Habr√©) about any new gadget, then by clicking on the application icon, you can immediately see where it is for sale and how much it costs.  Personally, I really like this thing. <br><br>  In conclusion, I want to clarify once again that the purpose of writing this material was not so much to advertise the application (although advertising free services is just for my part), but a completely understandable desire to get an audience assessment.  Will the app be useful?  Does it violate any user agreements?  What functionality could be added?  And once again, thanks in advance for the comments. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/177703/">https://habr.com/ru/post/177703/</a></p>
