    <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  The Dash project differs from the rest of the cryptocurrencies in that when generating new blocks, part of the award goes to Masternod operators, which ensure the operation of the network.  At the moment, the Masternods receive 47.5% rewards from the Dash block, along with miners (they ensure the safe operation of the blockchain). <br><br>  Having a security deposit in DASH and having invested only about $ 50 in equipment, you can also join those rational investors who earn money by running Dash Masters on <a href="http://raspberrypi.ru/">Raspberry Pi</a> microcomputers. <br><br>  <b>Pi time</b> <br><br>  We interviewed two Masternode operators and asked about their expenses, settings, and recommendations.  The participants of the official <a href="https://dashtalk.org/">DashTalk</a> forum "Mangled Blue" and "Fuzzyduck" support the work of their Masterno at Raspberry Pi 2, which cost about $ 40.  They added microSD (8GB) memory cards for the price of $ 8. <br><br>  Mangled Blue told us that it also uses an HDMI cable, an HDMI monitor, a USB keyboard and a USB mouse.  He said that the microcomputer can be used to charge from a mobile phone, or to power it with a microUSB-b-&gt; USB cable.  When everything is ready, it connects its Pi to the Internet modem using an Ethernet cable.  He does not recommend using the connection via Wi-Fi, but recognizes that such a solution can work.  He adds: <br><br>  ‚ÄúI knew about DASH cryptocurrency almost everything, in the smallest detail, as well as about other cryptocurrencies, but the process of launching my own Masternody opened for me a lot of new things.  It also prompted me to gain new knowledge - for example, a year ago I did not know anything about the Linux operating system. ‚Äù <br><br>  Fuzzyduck told us that the Raspberry Pi 1 model has only 512MB of RAM, which may not be enough for Masternody.  But the model Raspberry Pi 2 is armed with a whole gigabyte of memory, which is quite another matter.  From his words: <br><br>  ‚ÄúMy Pi2 is now very stable, and I hope that the new versions will work just as well.  I hope many people decide to try and launch such a solution themselves. ‚Äù <br><br>  <b>Security</b> <br><br>  To start Masternoda, you need to have a provision of 1000 DASH.  This amount remains at the user's complete disposal (the private key is not transferred anywhere).  The user can spend his DASH at any time, but his Masternoda‚Äôs work will stop as a result. <br><br>  The work model, which requires cash security, serves to protect the network from being taken over by ill-wishers (the so-called ‚Äú51% attack‚Äù) - a logical defense is in place that prevents concentration of a significant part of all Tornodn in one hand and makes attack attempts very costly for attackers .  This also has the side effect of stabilizing the price of DASH, which makes Dash very attractive for use as a stable currency. <br><br>  Are you interested in running Masternoda, but do not have the full amount of the security?  It's not a problem.  ‚ÄúEven if you do not have the required 1000 Dash, you can find companions with whom you will be able to launch the Masternode together - this is how I acted at first,‚Äù says ‚ÄúMangled Blue‚Äù.  "You will find a lot of information and responsive people on the forums that will help you get started and work." <br><br>  <b>Earnings</b> <br><br>  ‚ÄúAfter my Masternod has been working steadily for more than a month now, I can say with confidence that she has already paid for herself!‚Äù Says Fuzzyduck.  ‚ÄúThe current price of DASH exceeds $ 3.  My Pi2 costs about $ 35.  I get about three DASH every four days.  Do the math yourself. ‚Äù <br><br>  And regular payouts are not the only advantage for Fuzzyduck.  He continues: ‚ÄúSince many of us are techies, we love messing around with all the hardware and software - just for fun!  If I manage to do this, then you can do it too! ‚Äù <br><br>  <b>Security &amp; Risk Management</b> <br><br>  The user of the DashTalk forum "Flare" touched the security topic.  He says: <br><br>  ‚ÄúThe work of a publicly accessible host always requires compliance with security measures ‚Äî security policies that are used when running servers and VPS ‚Äî should also be used in the work of hosted Pi houses (including firewalls must be enabled and remote root access prohibited).‚Äù <br><br>  But even if your home network is hacked, the deposit of 1000 DASH will still remain secure, as neither Pi nor VPS will ever store your private keys. <br><br>  <b>Additional benefits</b> <br><br>  Dash masters do much more than just provide paid services to networks (first of all, very important systems such as DarkSend and InstantX work on their basis).  Each new node also enhances the decentralization of the Dash network - and this is a key element of any peer-to-peer system that aims to ensure sustainability and reliability. <br><br>  How successfully is the decentralization of Dash promoted through the masterno reward system?  The numbers speak for themselves: Bitcoin capitalization exceeds $ 4 billion, and the entire system operates on a network of only 6,000 nodes.  In contrast, the capitalization of Dash is only $ 20 million (less than half a percent of the Bitcoin index), but at the same time, the Dash network reliably operates on the basis of 2,700 Masternodes, and their number continues to grow. <br><br>  Visit the <a href="https://dashtalk.org/">DashTalk</a> forum and look for answers to your questions about how to run your Masternode.  To get started, read the detailed instructions from ‚ÄúFuzzyduck‚Äù ‚Äú <a href="https://dashtalk.org/threads/masternode-on-raspberry-pi-2-model-b.4083/">How to run the Dash Masternode on Raspberry Pi</a> ‚Äù. <br><br>  General information about what Dash is: <br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VsdLYy7UR7k" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/262659/">https://habr.com/ru/post/262659/</a></p>
