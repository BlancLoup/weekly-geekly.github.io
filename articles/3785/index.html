The gods sometimes descend on human heroes, and smaller servers are born from their intercourse, and human heroes remain forever in Traffic.

      Nobody knew that the gods of the Internet exist, but they appeared to us through Revelations. <br><br>  Once, one system administrator laid down a connection to the provider.  They wanted to fire him, but he prayed, turned on a server that was not connected to the Internet, and saw Traffic in it ... So the sysdam learned about the existence of the deity of Connect.  Its symbol is the Fiber Optic Wire, twisted into Eight. <br><br>  After 5 years, another system administrator came to the NYSE stanitsa, and saw the results of tomorrow's trading.  He bought all the shares that were supposed to rise, and became rich for a lifetime ... The goddess Date, symbolized by the digital watch, was born. <br><br>  The other user didn‚Äôt like system administrators very much, and always spoiled their lives for them.  Sysadmins pleaded to great servers, and a page with Porn appeared on the user's screen.  At that moment, his boss entered ... the user was fired.  Since then, for whatever work he came, he was given a test task, and at the time of delivery, a powerful deity appeared (up to a third of Traffic nor a fucky-muhra) Porn.  And while Porno will be walking on the Internet, until the eternal user will get any job ... The Porno Symbol is (well, you know, there are a lot of symbols, the sysadmin keeps in her heart in the independent directory. <br><br>  In one large-scale international project lived a manager.  He did most of the work, and many people depended on him in Australia, Burma, and Israel.  He was talented, but did not do his job well, because he put everything off for the end of the term.  And when he was reminded about the deadline, he said, ‚ÄúYes, yes, of course, I‚Äôll do everything now‚Äù - and let my partners down.  Then the Burmese (animalman by nature) told him in ICQ: ‚ÄúDo not blaspheme, Russian (you have already wondered about the nationality of the manager, right?), God will punish you!‚Äù.  But what to do?  Calculated losses, postponed the deadline for a week.  The Australian manager sent a card in which it was written: "Do not blaspheme, Russian, God will punish you!".  And again, the Russian did nothing.  When the Jew wrote Russian on the third week that God would punish him, the Russian replied that he was not afraid of the gods.  And then the goddess Deadline was angry, and the servers of the Russian fell, and the company went bankrupt.  And that Russian - Russian went to Redmond to work - they are not afraid of deadlines.  The symbol of the deadline is still unknown, for managers have been afraid to anger the goddess excessively since then. <br><br>  Servers do not like when they are overloaded.  Traffic goes, and it hurts.  Once the sysadmin has overloaded the server eight times.  And that day, the battery got on the phone, and he forgot to arm the office, and the cigarettes ran out, and the evil boss called, and the Black Mouse crossed the road, and finally took the money from his pocket and the tram moved.  Know, users and system administrators, that it is impossible to overload cars more than seven times a day.  For then comes the fearsome god Rezet, and sends you seven troubles.  And from here they say - "seven troubles - one Reset".  And the Reset symbol is a big button.  And it should be placed next to the Eight, and press lightly in the morning, greeting. <br><br>  About the rest of the gods, little has been heard.  There is, they say, the mischievous goddess Black Mouse, and the mischievous twin deities Lucky and Fakie.  The names of the rest while hidden. <br>  Since then, any real sysadmin should have a cult corner, with the Eight of Optical Fiber, Clock, Pamela Photo, Big Button, Black Mouse, and other religious objects. <br><br>  PS or Gigantomachia.  When programmers and sysadmins learned about the gods, others became puffed up excessively, and refused to recognize their power.  And they created the cult of the Black Hackers.  And they attacked the gods, October 22, 2002.  And nine of the 13 gods fell, but the rest repulsed, and they revived the fallen. <br><br>  Continue? </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/3785/">https://habr.com/ru/post/3785/</a></p>
