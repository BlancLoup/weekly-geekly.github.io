A big plus pill is their big disadvantage.  The tablet is universal, which means there are a large number of programs for it.  A person to understand this number of programs, to decide what he needs, does not always want, is not always necessary, and is not always possible.  Not every user is a gadget <a name="habracut"></a>  and not everyone likes to dig into the software.  For example, there are 158 and more reader programs.  And a person just wants to read a book.  In order to download and install the reader, he must know: <br>  - what formats support these readers, <br>  - in what formats does he have books, <br>  - where he will take these books, <br>  - he needs or doesn‚Äôt need an online electronic library or enough favorite books in the device‚Äôs memory. <br><br>  The same goes for videos and other things.  If a person just needs a device to read well, photos look good, plus go to the Internet to see a page and open a movie, then all that is beyond it becomes just a dead weight for him.

      This type of device appears as a media album.  In fact, these are devices on Android, in which functions that are not related to reading and multimedia are ‚Äúcut out‚Äù.  What is it done for?  The programs that are installed are, first, clearly adapted to this processor, to this device, they work as quickly and correctly as possible. <br><br>  Secondly, if you have a reading, you have your own library, the last open book that you need to ‚Äúremember‚Äù, all media files are systematized into specific directories and opened in a certain way convenient for a person.  If it is books, they open on the shelf.  The books also have an announcement: if you downloaded a book, you can see briefly what it is about.  Everything is done for readability.  The same goes for videos and photos.  Plus it has the ability to access the Internet.  How is it different from an ordinary book?  On the one hand, it works like a tablet: you can watch the Internet, you can install the program, the game.  But, on the other hand, at the same time, the functions that the main ones (reading, viewing) are performed are not just good, but very good.  That is, it becomes a very, very convenient reader.  In this case, the cost of these devices is equal to the cost of readers, that is, it is up to $ 150.  It is cheaper than the standard E-Inca reader and has much richer functionality than any other reader.  Moreover, for specific media tasks, it is much more convenient than a tablet. <br><br>  Naturally, 3G and other functions are not there and they are not needed, but there is Wi Fi, there are access to libraries.  By the way, in our 431st Raccoon there is an opportunity to have a certain disk space on the Internet, a person receives 5 GB in the clouds right away to store their files.  Documents can open there, books open there, and they fold beautifully, that is, it has its own memory, big enough, like a tablet, sees and reads SD cards up to 64 GB, like a tablet, but costs like a book - up to $ 150.  I start to release my media centers with a top model, with the 431st.  Further models will go more simple, costing from 70 to 150, they will be aimed at even more specific tasks. <br>  That is, the media album is a replacement for the e-book.  Plus, since I believe that even the most reading person not only reads (maximum 50% of the time), but he also needs to listen to the radio, and record a lecture, and see and save the pictures, which he may also need for business, and of course, watch the video.  In media albums, all these functions will work well. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d0c/7c3/bc1/d0c7c3bc1fa6413c778b9d0db3d3ce59.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  I believe that in the near future, everything will go there, even in our schools.  The cheapest books will be able to connect to the school's protected library, to the school radio, if it is once claimed, it will work.  If it (radio, and other possibilities) is not claimed, it will remain just a function that is. <br>  Here we release the 431st media album Raccoon, in just a month it will be on sale, I will make a separate review about it for the habr.  We also want to offer several models so that there is something to choose from for the price - these are the 411th and 421st models.  They will be easier and therefore will be cheaper.  That is, everything will be from the release of the road to a simpler model of Raccoon media albums. <br><br>  <i>These are my thoughts on the release of media albums, I'm sure that tablets will be segmented one way or another for the convenience of users.</i> <br><br><hr><br>  <a href="http://www.service.muk.ua/">MUK-Service - all types of IT repair: warranty, non-warranty repair, sale of spare parts, contract service</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/131415/">https://habr.com/ru/post/131415/</a></p>
