  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Billing a new generation. Part 1</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Hello to all! <br>  This is our first corporate blog post.  I was in a hurry, because I learned that tomorrow I would <a href="http://priceplan.ru/ru/">give a</a> presentation on PricePlan at RIW15.  Before that, I would like to talk about our product here - if you have any questions, suggestions or comments, ask them in the comments or <a href="http://riw.moscow/expo/softool/">tomorrow at RIW</a> . <br><br>  For three years now, my team has been working on creating a new generation of billing platform.  I am sure that many Habr readers have already encountered similar systems in their projects and understand their purpose and functionality.  So now I will not talk about what billing is and how it works.  Instead, I would like to tell you about those functions of PricePlan, which allow to refer it to a new generation of billing systems.  We are happy to continue this topic at a more "technical" level, if it interests you. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/1a7/b99/0f5/1a7b990f55eab987419d7ae5cde17e09.jpg" alt="image"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Firstly, by billing a new generation, we mean the possibility of cloud-scale scalability of the service under load and the presence of the principle of ‚ÄúMulti-tenancy‚Äù.  This allows you to reduce the time of introduction of the system in a typical service company to several days instead of several months.  A scan of the full version of billing in the cloud today can take only a few seconds. 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>
        <script>
          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      Secondly, the billing of a new generation is isolated from the business processes of a particular industry.  The basis of our platform is a system of events, triggers and rules, which allows the user to customize the billing for his model.  The most important thing is that the user-built logic can be easily changed at any time upon the first demand of the business. <br><br>  Thirdly, the billing of the new generation includes the sandbox mode - in PricePlan it is enabled by default at the beginning of work.  In this mode, the user can change the settings, create new rules and test the logic of billing processes.  After the user creates tariff plans in the system, sets price limits, determines discount models and business rules, our robot will be able to automatically perform all actions on a specific personalized system built by the user. <br><br>  <b>What can we do today:</b> <br>  - Declare and create new business logic in the rules module; <br>  - Create charges: periodic, one-time, upon use (counters); <br>  - Create invoices for payment and a package of closing documents; <br>  - credit payments to personal accounts from banks and payment systems; <br>  - Send trigger messages by email and SMS; <br>  - Exchange data with third-party programs through the REST API and Webhooks; <br>  - In real time, display information in the user's personal account; <br>  - Calculate data metrics CHURN, MRR, ARPU, LTV; <br>  - Bilateral integration with 1C Accounting and payment systems. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/253/f75/733/253f75733b4fc2187dc401d7b008d556.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>Who this service is for:</b> <br>  - SaaS, PaaS; <br>  - IaaS (Openstack and Azure); <br>  - Insurance companies; <br>  - Digital media; <br>  - Rental Property; <br>  - Any service working on a recurrent model. <br><br>  <b>Features of the engine.</b> <br>  In the sandbox mode, it is possible to create business rules and move in a time machine any day to the future in order to test their logic in a test mode.  The user can check the history of write-offs, renewals of subscriptions, notifications and submitted documents.  The mode helps to see all errors, inconsistencies in the rules and correct them before they affect the end users. <br><br>  After the system is tested and debugged, the user enters the ‚Äúcombat‚Äù mode.  The current date and time are synchronized with GMT.  Here you can act on two models: <br><br>  - Two-step (semi-automatic, with confirmation of each operation) model.  The closing of the day is done here in 2 steps: Automatic calculation of all operations and Manual confirmation of billing. <br><br>  - One-step (full automatic) model.  All actions specified in the rules are automatically executed at the close of the day.  All customer documents will be created and maintained, subscriptions renewed, notifications sent out.  The Full Automatic model is most effective, but also accompanied by the greatest risk.  In this mode, there is no possibility to cancel billing actions, the user can only check the report. <br><br>  We recommend using the first model for the first 2-3 months after the start of work and switch to the automatic model after - with full confidence in the correct operation of all rules. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/146/14b/a5c/14614ba5c3d4451da9a6d15c5e13fb42.png"><br><br>  Our team has made a lot of efforts to make the platform convenient for developers and integrators.  Practically everything that you find in the interface can be implemented through the <a href="http://docs.priceplan.ru/">rest API</a> .  I will wait for your questions and suggestions here in the comments.  And I will be happy to talk to you personally at RIW.  See you! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/269201/">https://habr.com/ru/post/269201/</a></p>
