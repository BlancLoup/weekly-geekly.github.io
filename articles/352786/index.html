      Hello to all.  My name is Ilya, and I am one of the veterans of the Microsoft Student Partners program.  I want to tell you about all the available suggestions for using Azure for students. <br><br><h2>  Azure for Students Starter </h2><br>  A lot of time has passed since Azure entered the market, but earlier, students had to pay the full cost of all the services used if they heard about new technologies and wanted to try them.  And to help students, Microsoft in 2015 released a special offer for students.  It had both a number of advantages (a subscription is created for 1-2 minutes and no credit card data is needed during creation) and its own drawbacks (from the services only a free web site and SQL database of up to 30 MB were available).  Frankly, this is not even enough for the prototype of a student project.  For 3 years, the number of services increased to 6, however, age restrictions of 16+ appeared. <br><br>  So, Azure for Students Starter is the ideal solution for people who want to get acquainted with cloud technologies.  However, the presented stack of technologies is not enough for a full development. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/r_/0u/lw/r_0ulws9hocu0ae-0ck-f4jtyuk.png" alt="image"><br><br>  If this offer is of interest, then you can read it <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/students-starter-faq">here</a> . <br><br><h2>  Azure Free Account </h2><br>  More recently, a new Azure Free Account offer has appeared.  It includes the use of about 30 very different Azure services, but it has some limitations.  First, all services are limited in resources (750 hours of computing on virtual machines per month, 10 applications with the Azure App Service), and if their use passes beyond the limit, then the ‚Äúgolden parachute‚Äù in the form of $ 200 saves (money issued to first 30 days).  Secondly, some services (the same databases and virtual machines) will be available for free for only 12 months.  Also, to activate this account, you need credit card details. <br><br>  In addition to limited services, there are 25 unlimited free services (for example, Azure Active Directory, Azure Service Fabric and cognitive services). <br>  Here are some of them: <br><br><ol><li>  10 sites, mobile, or application APIs using the Azure App Service with 1 GB storage </li><li>  30,000 Face API transactions per month and 20 per minute </li><li>  750 hours Azure B1S Virtual Machine on Linux or Windows </li><li>  2 million characters in the Translator Text API </li><li>  100 Machine Learning modules and 10 GB storage access per hour for each experiment </li></ol><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/t-/8u/rs/t-8urszakp_hh4vun-puhhnwhr0.png" alt="image"><br><br>  As a result, Azure Free Account is an offer that is much more technological than the previous one.  It gives $ 200 for the first month, but it requires credit card details.  This offer is suitable for teachers who want to demonstrate the ability of Azure and will not go beyond the limits. <br><br>  Read more <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/free-account-faq">here</a> . <br><br><h2>  Azure for Students </h2><br>  Students can be attracted by the first offer, since there are almost no obligations in it, but it is not very rich in technology.  On the other hand, the second offer is more attractive from a technological point of view, but for its activation it is necessary to enter credit card details.  Moreover, the starting $ 200 is given only for 30 days. <br><br>  Why am I doing this?  Besides, Azure for Students is a symbiosis of the first two sentences!  In it, a large stack of technologies (the same as in the Azure Free Account) is intertwined with starting $ 100 (no time limit) and the lack of credit card data.  To get it, you need to have three things: <br><br><ol><li>  Live ID (account in Windows 10) </li><li>  Phone (to verify your Azure account) </li><li>  Participation in the program Microsoft Imagine (free) </li></ol><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/kt/0q/0v/kt0q0ve8tc-6-87ht9xiwwcz7ly.png" alt="image"><br><br><h2>  How to become a member of Microsoft Imagine? </h2><br>  Microsoft Imagine is a program to support students of technical (and not only) universities.  It provides free software (in particular, Visual Studio and Windows Server) and access to student Azure. <br><br>  In order to receive it, you must confirm your student status (mail on the university domain / Microsoft activation code / Shibboleth account).  Shibboleth and university mail are not very common in Russia, and the Microsoft activation code can <b>only</b> be obtained at official student events at Microsoft or Microsoft Student Partners.  Activation can be done in two ways: either through the portal Microsoft Imagine, or through the <a href="http://aka.ms/azure4stud">site</a> .  After that, you need to give contact information on the Azure portal. <br><br><h2>  Activation through Microsoft Imagine </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/in/nl/8i/innl8i3caagp-_wuwsurjao7iui.png" alt="image"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/6z/on/po/6zonpo1eqsbvdqraglqvqrihan8.png" alt="image"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/8i/7k/ic/8i7kic9vppamw68xslpc__n_joa.png" alt="image"><br><br><h2>  Activate through student site Azure </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/7l/5f/rq/7l5frqzkbjbohiaw2yprdmevqvk.png" alt="image"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/vp/9z/ev/vp9zevnrsyh3ozvo2ztc_olkcmu.png" alt="image"><br><br>  After that, you will be taken to the Azure Account Setup page and your account will be ready. <br><br>  To summarize, Azure for Students is the best deal for students to use the cloud.  It includes many different services and can serve as an excellent start for any student project.  And in order to understand how to use Azure in real projects, I advise you to visit the Russian Final of the international Imagine Cup competition, which will be held on April 14 in Moscow and take part in a technology quest.  And, if you are a student or a high school student, you can also receive a verification code for Microsoft Imagine. <br><br>  If you have any questions about Azure or about student activities, write me a private message. <br><br><h2>  Imagine Cup 2018. Russian final in Moscow </h2><br>  Microsoft invites you to become a spectator of the Russian final of the international technological competition of student projects Imagine Cup 2018. This year we are gathering the best students for the 16th time to select the winner! <br><br>  On April 14, we invite you to the Red October territory, to the Digital October space, where the finalists will present their innovative projects. <br><br>  Do not forget to <a href="https://aka.ms/imaginecup2018_offline">register</a> . <br><br> <a href="https://aka.ms/imaginecup2018_offline"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/jd/ca/1j/jdca1jupjieeifyctx9povedu7o.jpeg"></a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/352786/">https://habr.com/ru/post/352786/</a></p>
