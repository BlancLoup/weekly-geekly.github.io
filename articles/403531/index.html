Of course, children cannot drive a car, but a child can still fulfill his dream, learning the tricks of driving on his own electric cycle or drifter. <br><br>  The company Razor offers a choice of many models of electric bikes, cars, electric scooters.  Today we decided to focus on the Razor Power Rider 360 and Lil Crazy, which are designed for different driving styles and different ages of children.  Let's see what is here and how. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h3>  Razor Power Rider 360 </h3><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Op55GBptaS4" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  A smart electrocycle for a child aged 8+.  There is no need to turn the pedals, the owner only has to follow the direction of the movement - the bike can handle the rest.  Power reserve is very good - the child can drive 15 kilometers, before the battery sits down.  Of course, we are not talking about someone driving a Razor PowerRider 360 on the road.  But in the yard, in the country you can ride as much as you want, not really thinking about the fact that the battery is about to sit down.

      In Power Rider 360 everything is thought out to the smallest detail.  The front wheel is pneumatic, with a conventional nipple.  Rear wheels - double roller, with a slope for drift and rotation.  Probably, on such a thing would be happy to ride and adults, but no - this is a children's electrocycle.  Although, if an adult weighs 55 kg or less - it is possible to try, the scooter is designed for just such a weight.  As for growth, the child or teenager with a growth from 110 to 170 cm can easily fit. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/cf3/60f/9a2/cf360f9a2f0a5e7437070c0eb32a4c67.png" width="1200"><br><br>  Power reserve provides a battery of 24 V. A fully charged battery will allow the child to have fun for about 45 minutes (this is if you drive continuously).  You can recharge the battery from any source of energy for 220 V. Both a child and an adult can use the charger.  Of course, the charger is designed in such a way as to be as safe as possible, but if parents want, they can charge the scooter themselves.  Battery charging time is about 12 hours. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/219/f19/eea/219f19eea6d7201fe890aa33277e03f7.png" width="1200"><br><br>  As for speed, the Razor PowerRider 360 can dial up to 13 kilometers per hour.  This is fast enough, so that the young driver should wear a helmet and protection, as for roller skating.  The scooter is made as stable as possible, but we all know the ability of children to look for adventures :) In any case, the scooter will not roll over even if the child decides to make a sharp turn around the axis while driving, as in the video shown above.  For this you can not worry. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/ed9/617/689/ed9617689e1b38fa5e340a8604c091af.png" width="1200"><br><br>  The base of the scooter is made of durable stainless steel, which allows it to withstand significant loads.  At the same time, the scooter is light enough so that the child can handle it.  By the way, the instruction is very clear - this is important, because the Razor PowerRider 360 can be called a complex device that you need to deal with before you go.  Moreover, the vehicle after purchase, you must first collect.  It's not so difficult, we managed to bring the scooter on full alert for 15 minutes. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/612/92d/15e/61292d15eac0cb368dc6e7fdfca7c45f.jpg" width="1200"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f2e/964/a5a/f2e964a5ac4249bc93a9c29d0b964d9d.jpg"><br><br>  As in a regular scooter, under the seat there is a vault for small things.  Surely the child will want to take with him his favorite things + some tools for a scooter.  Such a system is more convenient than the glove box on a children's bike, which some readers of Geektimes may remember.  There also fit a lot of things, but there is much more space under the scooter's seat than in the bicycle glove compartment. <br><br>  <b>Specifications</b> <br><br><ul><li>  Dimensions: 70 √ó 61.5 √ó 26 cm; </li><li>  Weight: 14.9 kg; </li><li>  Recommended age: for children from 8 years old (height from 110 to 170 cm); </li><li>  Frame: welded steel, folding foot tights; </li><li>  Motor power: 100 W; </li><li>  Maximum speed: 13 km / h; </li><li>  Power reserve: up to 40 minutes; </li><li>  Front wheel: pneumatic, with car nipple; </li><li>  Back wheels: double roller, with a bias for drift and rotation; </li><li>  Brake: front manual; </li><li>  Steering wheel: soft rubber grips; </li><li>  Maximum load: 55 kg. </li></ul><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/f67/1a4/499/f671a44995aa48c344763c0917942fdd.jpg" width="1200"><br><br>  By the way, you can also drift on this scooter!  To get started, click on the button and go on the road.  Having accelerated, you can perform all sorts of different maneuvers. <br><br>  Where can one buy?  In Russia, the electric <a href="http://madrobots.ru/p/elektroskuter-dlya-drifta-razor-power-rider-360/%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes.ru%26utm_medium%3Dpr%26utm_campaign%3Drazor">cycle</a> can be purchased <a href="http://madrobots.ru/p/elektroskuter-dlya-drifta-razor-power-rider-360/%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes.ru%26utm_medium%3Dpr%26utm_campaign%3Drazor">at Madrobots</a> . <br><br><h3>  Razor Lil Crazy: Drift for Kids </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/f54/802/269/f54802269e4369eff35288e73d9afb35.jpg" width="1200"><br><br>  If the Razor PowerRider 360 is an electric cycle on which already grown kids can ride, then the Razor Lil Crazy is designed for the youngest drivers from 2 years old (and up to about 5, then the child does not fit).  Such cards will definitely appeal to both boys and girls, whose height is no more than 120 cm, and weight - 20 kilograms.  There is everything that is typical for a regular map, including the steering wheel, the gas pedal, the wheels for drifting. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/57e/dc1/8a3/57edc18a3f58f00ea256ace6146f9783.jpg" width="1200"><br><br>  The card works thanks to an electric motor at 6 volts, which allows you to accelerate up to 3.5 km / h.  Power reserve is about the same as in the previous version - you can ride for about 50 minutes in a row. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Peo-4rNsito" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  What can be done on such a map?  Of course, drift!  From an early age, the baby will learn to coordinate with the movement of the vehicle.  In addition to pure pleasure (the children really like this card), we also get training on how to control your own machine. <br><br>  The direction of movement is set using the steering wheel.  A special arrow shows its correct position so that the child is not confused.  In order to get under way, you need to press a special pedal.  We recommend wearing a helmet, despite the fact that the cards are very stable, safety has not been canceled. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/dd7/67d/4a0/dd767d4a0afd635f77f6c7faa4db21ff.jpg" width="1200"><br><br>  Before you go, you need to collect drift cards, it will literally take a couple of tens of minutes, not more.  Comes with a charger for the card. <br><br>  <b>Specifications</b> <br><br><ul><li>  Age: from 2 years; </li><li>  For children in height: from 80 to 120 cm; </li><li>  Maximum load: 20 kg; </li><li>  Dimensions: width 47 cm, total length 69 cm; </li><li>  Steering wheel: 360 degrees; </li><li>  Speed: up to 3.5 km / h; </li><li>  Operating time: up to 40 minutes of continuous use; </li><li>  Manual power on: the engine is activated by pressing the foot pedal; </li><li>  Steering functions: Allows you to rotate and rotate; </li><li>  Material: polypropylene (front wheels) and urethane (rear wheels), urethane (rear wheels). </li></ul><br>  Buy, as always, <a href="http://madrobots.ru/p/razor-lil-crazy/%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes.ru%26utm_medium%3Dpr%26utm_campaign%3Drazor">you can from us</a> . <br><br><hr><br> <a href="http://madrobots.ru/%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes.ru%26utm_medium%3Dpr%26utm_campaign%3Drazor"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d29/4c3/07d/d294c307dde04335ac3f425e73b36a7a.gif"></a> <br> <a href="http://madrobots.ru/about/mails/%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes.ru%26utm_medium%3Dpr%26utm_campaign%3Drazor"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/7fa/417/fe3/7fa417fe3d464fa5aa186b1ab30da53a.gif"></a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/403531/">https://habr.com/ru/post/403531/</a></p>
