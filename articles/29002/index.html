  <section class="page js-page"><h1>MuzKontakt - social network of musicians</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  In May 2008, a new musical resource, <a href="http://muzkontakt.ru/">MuzKontakt.ru,</a> appeared on the Internet.  Internet project is focused on people involved in music.  The site can be a good helper in a quick search for musicians, music bands, help get timely and useful information from "colleagues in the shop."  The distinction of Muzkontakt.ru from a variety of sites is the focus, primarily on the musician, as a unit of musical culture.  The purpose of the site is to enable musicians to tell about themselves personally, about their experiences, interests, their musical groups. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/cc2/379/970/cc23799701d5e8ee50e95b406161ab71.jpg" width="450" height="300" hspace="10" vspace="10"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  And now I will tell why this site is needed and why the idea to make it appeared.

      Now (already) a lot of social networks, including music, for musicians.  Usually they are made like this, register as a group, add photos, audio tracks, etc.  Next, we begin to develop the social component, to be friends with other groups.  What is it like?  How can a band be friends with a band?  Usually this is the case, the leader of the group made an account on the social network, filled out the information and found groups where he knows someone, added them as a friend.  It is even better when adding groups of friends becomes an end in itself on a resource, to measure something before each other.  Those.  the idea is that the social component is not transparent, or even turned on its side. <br><br>  The Muzkontakt website had an idea to implement a slightly different approach.  Only musicians who can add their own musical groups are registered on the site.  Those.  4 members of one group registered, and added this group to the site.  And as they will be friends and build social bridges, it is their own business.  Moreover, in order to add a group, it is not necessary at the same time to go all over to the site ‚Äúby joining hands‚Äù at the same time :) It is enough for one musician from the group to register, add the group and invite their musicians to it. <br><br>  One more thing they tried to take into account on the site, these are groups that have already broken up and do not exist.  Here is a direct analogue with all sorts of sites, such as remember, pierce, etc.  And also in the group there may be participants who played in the team once, and the current composition of the group. <br><br>  Thus, we get 2 interesting stories: 1) the history of the musician, in which groups he played 2) the history of the group, which musicians played in it. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/fb1/d05/88a/fb1d0588a77f2bc66a42b6a2cf1c9fff.jpg" width="450" height="300" hspace="10" vspace="10"><br><br>  For the site there are still a few ideas that will be useful to musicians.  This includes rehearsal bases, a list of music stores, studios, etc. <br><br>  Immediately make a reservation, the site is still "damp", there is still a lot of work on it. <br>  We write it in PHP + MySQL + Prototype.  There are 3 people in the team, but only 2 of them are programmers :) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/29002/">https://habr.com/ru/post/29002/</a></p>
