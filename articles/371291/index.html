Two weeks later, this document <a href="https://www.rrauction.com/preview_itemdetail.cfm%3FIN%3D5002">will be auctioned</a> with a price forecast of $ 50,000. <br><br>  A college guy wanted to get a job as an ‚Äúelectronics tech or design engineer‚Äù.  As you can see, he was still striving to work in this promising area from a young age: electronics and computers inspired young Jobs. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  One page of the application for employment contains quite a few spelling, punctuation and semantic errors.  ‚ÄúTrue, the document does not reflect the perfectionism you might expect from an entrepreneur who founded one of the most successful and influential technology companies in the world,‚Äù <a href="https://www.theinquirer.net/inquirer/news/3027270/pre-apple-steve-jobs-cv-to-go-for-usd50-000-at-auction-next-month">writes</a> <i>The Inquirer</i> .

      For example, as a home address, Steve Jobs wrote ‚Äúreed college‚Äù with a small letter.  This is a college in Oregon, where young Steve did not study long after he left school in Cupertino.  He quickly dropped out of school, but after that he lived in a college dormitory for another year and a half, apparently during this period he wrote this resume.  During these one and a half years, Steve Jobs engaged in self-development, <a href="https://geektimes.ru/post/130425/">took drugs</a> , flew to India, became a Buddhist, attended courses in Shakespeare, dance and calligraphy.  In 2005, he recalled calligraphy courses as an important thing that later influenced the style of Apple and Mac. <br><br>  In the sections ‚ÄúSpecial Skills‚Äù (Special Abilities) and ‚ÄúInterests‚Äù (Interests) Steve Jobs wrote: ‚ÄúTechnical engineer or designer.  digital. "(tech or design engineer. digital.) In an indiscriminate hand, further added:" - from the Gulf near Hewitt-Packard "(- from Bay near Hewitt-Packard).  Probably, Steve Jobs wanted to write the name of the company Hewlett-Packard, which at that time was one of the most innovative companies in the field of information technology. <br><br>  Although Jobs himself wrote in a statement, what kind of work he wants to get, but the resume does not indicate for which vacancy the document is being drawn up - and it does not even indicate what kind of company attracted the attention of the young talent.  This is just proof that from a young age Steve Jobs dreamed of working in the high-tech industry: to design and create a design for new devices ‚Äî something that he did very well after decades.  Obviously, the 18-year-old Stephen already felt this talent in himself. <br><br>  But the fact is that he was not hired.  In 1974, he still got a job as a technician at Atari, and in 1976, enthusiast and visionary Steve Jobs founded Apple with engineer Steve Wozniak.  14-year-old Jobs met a 19-year-old Wozniak in 1969 - they were united by a love of technology and electronics. <br><br>  In a statement, Jobs also noted that he has a driver's license.  On the question of whether there is access to transport, he replied, ‚ÄúProbably, but not likely‚Äù (possible, but not probabale), which is also unusual.  In the column "phone number" - "absent." <br><br>  In the column for specifying the skills, ‚Äúcomputer‚Äù and ‚Äúcalculator‚Äù are marked with a note ‚Äúdesign, technology‚Äù. <br><br>  This small document reflects the extraordinary personality of Stephen Jobs, who, at the age of 18, wrote his small name with a small letter, showing a non-pattern of thinking. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ar/xw/so/arxwso-yh-nq8dl2pvz_qh7ru2k.jpeg"><br><br>  Steve Jobs passed away from cancer in 2011 at the age of 56. <br><br>  The auction will be held by the company RRAuction from March 8 to 15, 2018.  In addition to the application for a job, two more lots related to Apple and Steve Jobs will be put up for auction - this is Mac OS X technical guide signed by Jobs in 2001 (estimated cost from $ 25,000), and an autograph from 2008 year (estimated cost from $ 15,000) with a photo of Jobs and the title "New, faster iPhone will go on sale at a price of $ 199."  In fact, ten years ago, iPhones sold much cheaper than they do now.  Although there, probably, was indicated the price with the contract. <br><br>  Perhaps, one of the Russian patrons of art will wish to take part in the auction in order to bring the relic to Russia, where Steve Jobs has many fans. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/371291/">https://habr.com/ru/post/371291/</a></p>
