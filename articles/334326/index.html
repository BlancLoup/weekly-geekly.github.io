  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Yota in Russia: from unlimited to flexible packages</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  In 2014, another player appeared on the Russian TV market: Yota began to provide mobile services.  The main feature of our products for the smartphone and tablet has become unlimited internet.  The basic package of services also included an unlimited number of minutes within the network, from 100 minutes of calls to external numbers in Russia and the ability to connect unlimited or piecemeal SMS.  The range of services and the geography of Yota's presence has gradually expanded: today our SIM cards for smartphones can be purchased in 82 regions of Russia. <br><br>  We always strive to give our customers the most convenient product, and today we will tell you how to reinvent mobile services. <br><br> <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/yota/blog/334326/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/f51/c10/5f0/f51c105f010347aab7b5cfe237f36b81.jpg"></a> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  For 1.5 years, we practically did not change the principle of providing services for a smartphone.  But it became obvious to us that almost all the clients who really needed unlimited Internet had already joined us.  And 85% of new customers consume no more than 5 gigabytes of Internet per month.

      That is why at the end of 2016 we decided to change the format of service provision.  And in early 2017, Yota introduced the first version of the line.  Now, clients could independently choose the best traffic for them + outgoing minutes to other numbers in Russia, as well as connect the unlimited applications option, thanks to which it was possible to use the most popular social networks and instant messengers without any restrictions. <br><br>  This kind of service provision remained until July this year.  And the option of unlimited applications turned out to be so popular that a quarter of customers connected it or switched to the new line. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/292/3f0/ca0/2923f0ca0fb949a184cec486b65b5d02.jpg"><br><br>  However, the product, as shown by feedback from customers, was still not optimal.  Most often, users were asked to make the services of the mobile operator Yota even more flexible and to give the opportunity to collect more personalized packages. <br><br>  On July 25, we presented a completely reworked product.  Thanks to the new lineup, customers can just collect their own optimal set of services in just a few clicks and literally in 30 seconds and pay only for what they need. <br><br>  First, gigabytes are no longer tied to minutes.  You can separately select the required number of minutes for outgoing calls to numbers in Russia.  Depending on the region, the line starts from 100-300 minutes, and the maximum package includes 5000 minutes.  Yes, by the way, calls within the Yota network are still unlimited, regardless of the regions where the interlocutors are located, and I do not spend the minutes from the package. <br><br>  The traffic range starts from 1-2 GB, the maximum package includes 30 GB.  Gigabytes of the package can be distributed to other devices.  And if suddenly the package ends, you can always buy another 5 GB.  For example, in Moscow an additional package costs 100 rubles. <br><br>  Secondly, we have shared the option of unlimited mobile applications.  And now you can buy unlimited access to the most popular social networks and instant messengers individually.  Currently, nine applications are available for unlimited connectivity: Facebook + Facebook Messenger, VKontakte, Odnoklassniki, Instagram, Twitter, WhatsApp, Viber, Telegram and Skype. <br><br>  Of course, we also kept what our customers liked in our previous lines.  We will still give you the opportunity to choose unlimited or piece-by-text SMS, change your package every new billing period, use text messages in international roaming for free and do not charge additional fees when traveling in Russia. <br><br>  <a href="https://yadi.sk/d/4GiEQWFa3LLyuX">Video</a> <br><br>  You can try to create your optimal package and see how much it will cost, you can on our website <a href="https://www.yota.ru/">yota.ru.</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/334326/">https://habr.com/ru/post/334326/</a></p>
