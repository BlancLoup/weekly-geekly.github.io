We add to the kettle Wifi - we get a new cool <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/avi/blog/194438/">gadget</a> .  We add WiFi to the objective ... And we get a new class of devices that can take pictures without even having a screen.  Meet - Sony Cybershot DSC-QX10. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/2b4/157/ef5/2b4157ef50e4c918df9261f261084460.jpg"><br>  Of course, photographing without a screen is rather difficult.  The screen is any phone to which the ‚Äúcamera‚Äù transmits a picture.  To manage, you only need to install a proprietary program from the manufacturer. <br>  So what is this under-camera or re-lens? <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  <font color="#C98437">‚ñ∫</font> Introduction <br></h4>  I noticed this thing a long time ago, from the time it was shown at IFA-2013.  I immediately thought - if they are so good as they describe it, then this is a great thing for phones in which their camera doesn‚Äôt shoot very much.  And as soon as the opportunity presented itself, I immediately found and bought it. <br><br>  The first association when a box came into my hands was a roll of toilet paper. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/61a/8c3/908/61a8c39085f49950c5b7ed55b58d6cf4.jpg"><br>  Well, indeed, even the texture is indistinguishable from a cardboard roll, on which this toilet paper is wound. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b37/821/b6b/b37821b6bff143505695ed88436577b6.jpg"><br>  But on the packaging of toilet paper is usually no WiFi icons and power supply.  Apparently this saved the gadget from being misused. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/43a/565/b3a/43a565b3a577abf3accce457966fafeb.jpg"><br>  He still got me on the table.  Equipment: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f08/60a/a1d/f0860aa1d41bc9b8a22a13f1d5fcc72b.jpg"><br>  Objective (every time I stumble when I call it so - what is it an objective, if I can take a picture and save the picture on the card?), Fasteners on the phone, battery, hand strap, cable and a set of pieces of paper. <br>  Completely ordinary microUSB cable: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/0ba/68f/8a5/0ba68f8a59bd32351d5d3e1f3d9d63f5.jpg"><br>  630mAh battery: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a1d/aee/ec6/a1daeeec6f54e528ec6da399640fa64d.jpg"><br>  The device itself: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/bf7/376/607/bf737660714cd665d2b8e2d50e2e4a63.jpg"><br>  Sliding fasteners with which the lens can catch on almost any phone: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/3f8/812/372/3f881237212789241e2b76dd3379505b.jpg"><br>  It looks like this: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/73f/9b4/0b5/73f9b40b598b04e8ec92aaf3696ddac6.jpg"><br>  It fully clings to the Xperia Z, and you can push it a little more.  The maximum width of the phone that can be fixed in it is a little more than 7 and a half centimeters.  And the thickness is about one and a half centimeters.  In short, it will work on most phones, with the exception of the Samsung Note line. <br><br><h4>  <font color="#C98437">‚ñ∫</font> Appearance <br></h4><br>  Bottom side - a hole under the standard tripod hardware, and fasteners for the strap on the hand. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/660/358/614/6603586147c4c8dc23616c425a7a7345.jpg"><br>  On a tripod it looks pretty funny: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d79/05a/3b7/d7905a3b7fb14d83cff8238e282702b2.jpg"><br>  It is clear that it is designed for small tripods.  By the way, Sony thought and nevertheless made a flat pad down - the lens stands well on any flat surface. <br>  At the top - the power button, indicator, two microphones and NFC. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/883/db9/17f/883db917fb9773d08862a90b1c279a80.jpg"><br>  The indicator glows green during operation, yellow - during charging.  After a full charge goes out. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b7b/104/1db/b7b1041db2c6cb057a5e957d874fb47d.jpg"><br>  NFC performs two functions - when you bring it to the phone, it opens a link to the program in the market, and when the program is running, it turns on the power to the device.  It looks like this, bring the phone to the lens, the program starts on the phone, the lens turns on and connects to the phone.  And you do not need to enter a password. <br>  On the right side (when looking at the lens) - the shutter release button and zoom lever.  What's nice, the shutter button is not only with the half-press, it also works fine in the application, allowing you to take pictures without touching the screen at all.  And without an application, you can also take pictures (if you insert a memory card) - just turn it on and press a button.  True, aim terribly uncomfortable in the absence of the viewfinder.  Here it is not enough, at least for framing. <br>  Even on this side there is a charging connector - the usual MicroUSB: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/24e/8a8/541/24e8a854171b518bd1ff6145728f6078.jpg"><br>  Unfortunately, it only works to charge.  You cannot copy photos from a memory card or control the camera from it.  What is interesting - despite this, it is still defined in the system as a USB Powered Device. <br>  Behind - fasteners for grabbing the phone and the battery cover: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/eb0/1f7/275/eb01f7275b1d945c2bcd232c5620a1c7.jpg"><br>  Under the cover is the battery itself: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f63/e45/f6b/f63e45f6b4a00918eefd17940f5616a3.jpg"><br>  And below - a slot for memory cards.  Once again, the joke is confirmed that Sony supports the Memory Stick because it cannot release the device without it ‚Äî they won't understand it, but MicroSD ‚Äî because they won't buy it without it :) <br>  On the battery cover - a sticker with a password for the connection: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/2f1/78d/db4/2f178ddb4acad9ff1569065d508b8a85.jpg"><br>  The same sticker is present on the manual: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/0ee/dc0/0c8/0eedc00c8113aecf19b2598be485f912.jpg"><br>  The password does not change, and you can not find it. <br>  On the left of the interesting - only a small LCD screen: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/45b/537/0c9/45b5370c9381eea88a9cc6f9f715bc0e.jpg"><br>  It shows the battery charge and the presence of a memory card in the card reader.  If there is no memory card, it shows nothing.  If charging is in progress, yes, it also shows nothing!  :) <br>  The matrix inside - Exmor R CMOS diagonal 1 / 2.3 inches.  Not very much, but compared to telephone 1/4 - almost twice as much. <br>  Focal length, reduced to 35mm - from 25mm: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/04a/37f/2cb/04a37f2cb4c8fb38422ffef0a59c5ff3.jpg"><br>  Up to 250mm: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/661/6ca/d43/6616cad43e217f4d59eee52d52c9dbdd.jpg"><br>  Which, of course, is called a tenfold zoom :)

    <h4>  <font color="#C98437">‚ñ∫</font> Application <br></h4>  In operation, the construction looks like this: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/843/8a9/a92/8438a9a928f1c99b1d90a604296ba238.jpg"><br><br>  When you first start the application offers to turn on the lens, but you can make it easier - attach a label to the phone's NFC reader.  It will turn on the lens itself and connect with it. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b4a/935/33c/b4a93533c237626206fc74f994a2100c.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/cbb/65f/78c/cbb65f78c9f5cfc58514a92139aef9eb.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/093/20f/557/09320f5570ffe13a8cd881fed4c78bc2.png"><br>  After connecting, we get to the main screen of the program.  Although there are a lot of different icons, nothing can be done with them by and large.  poking at the screen, you can choose the place where you want to focus, using the W and T buttons - <s>change the zoom</s> pardon, zoom. <br><br>  The top icon can choose one of three modes: Intelligent auto mode, super auto mode, and auto program.  From the name is absolutely not clear how they differ.  However, from the photos too - they remove all three modes in my opinion absolutely equally, they determine the type of frame (macro, portrait, other) also correctly.  Use the Mode button to change the type of shooting - video photo. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a1d/007/145/a1d00714570d09b28056111dfabf1a70.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/12a/692/392/12a6923926a0205903b4c25473cf400d.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/7b9/4e1/64b/7b94e164bb489996414a07b4ad78efd7.png"><br>  Well, go to a rather scanty settings, in which you can choose the size of the picture, adjust the display time after taking photos, as well as the size of the photo to copy to the phone and save to the card.  Small images are copied much faster after shooting than full-sized ones, with full-sized ones being saved on the map, from where they can always be pulled out and copied into the light.  And for <a href="http://instagram.com/vvz_vlad">instagram there</a> are still big pictures without need. <br><br>  After pressing the shutter (even on the lens, even in the application), you will see a sign with the progress of copying the photo, after which it will be saved to the Play Memories Mobile album (you cannot change the name) and appear on the screen.  Also, by selecting the ‚Äúcopy from a connected device‚Äù option in the settings menu (!), You can view the photos on the memory card and copy them to the same folder. By pressing the camera icon, you can go back to the photographing screen. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/bdd/e66/1f8/bdde661f8084fa39087b01bd7267161d.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/9ff/b9b/98e/9ffb9b98e7ee4762ed9c1c039cab7077.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c4c/3eb/459/c4c3eb4593acc2dc509f7c4ed8b51bbc.png"><br><br><h4>  <font color="#C98437">‚ñ∫</font> Case for Xperia Z <br></h4>  In addition to these gadgets here, for Xperia Z, you can purchase a case with a mount for the lens: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/5f5/fab/fe1/5f5fabfe12fe1a658d409c039182bea8.jpg"><br>  With him, by the way, much more convenient.  You can unhook and attach the lens at any time, the cover without the lens can remain on the phone without interfering with the work with it.  The latch mechanism can be closed swivel cap: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/fec/c6f/c8b/fecc6fc8b7a94f203ea4f5e0fd86293f.jpg"><br>  And this is how it looks without a cap: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/884/8fc/08c/8848fc08c4e60544f797d63e30caa061.jpg"><br>  He sits quite tightly, it is difficult to remove him from his habit. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a9b/d08/beb/a9bd08bebbf38c9821686aca88a9372a.jpg"><br>  In addition, it saves a centimeter of thickness of the structure: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/7a8/7a6/b9c/7a87a6b9cf9a6bb3fef6d6db50dbd772.jpg"><br>  And with a case: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/22c/73b/7e6/22c73b7e6a11ac3c77e6d208b4e1c3ca.jpg"><br>  It is a pity that it is only for one phone.  Maybe after a while, the Chinese will pop up. <br><br><h4>  <font color="#C98437">‚ñ∫</font> Photo <br></h4>  And now the slides!  Macro: <br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/1e6/a44/154/1e6a441543bdc7632fcbf16821226f15.jpg" alt="image"></a> <br>  Another macro: <br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/4eb/55c/978/4eb55c9786e7e709871b0da3e65eb1dd.jpg" alt="image"></a> <br>  And yet (well, I love macro): <br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/643/294/357/6432943571e241e1d37e202ead06893f.jpg" alt="image"></a> <br><br>  The corner of the room with a focal 25mm: <br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/7bb/aa2/08e/7bbaa208e34d6418e0d39bb7e064d114.jpg" alt="image"></a> <br>  The same, but 250mm.  Everything was filmed with hands, without emphasis. <br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/4bb/a23/2d4/4bba232d449577a8c2bca1ad0da70291.jpg" alt="image"></a> <br><br>  Food: <br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/daf/d53/126/dafd531262913b0bae50723f03e63e2c.jpg" alt="image"></a> <br><br>  Of particular note is the possibility of shooting in low light.  There is some tricky technology when he takes more than one shot with a shutter speed of 3 seconds, but 5-10 pieces with shutter speeds of 90-120, and then sticks them together.  Click-click-click-click-click-click-click-click, and at night it turns out such a frame: <br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e81/f07/68b/e81f0768b50dab0a47feb56aa5e4b6f9.jpg" alt="image"></a> <br>  The previous photo was taken at 9 pm, it was already quite dark.  And this one - at one in the morning: <br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/2d5/7b8/af1/2d57b8af1beea85ab5fe914f2c5ad643.jpg" alt="image"></a> <br>  Here, too, all the frames from the hands.  Naturally, I didn‚Äôt shoot at the stretched arms while running, but stood calmly ‚Äúbreathed out, stopped, pressed the trigger‚Äù.  But nevertheless, on long exposures this technique does not help, and the frame turns out to be filled with a nasty shag, and the lamps leave a tortuous mark. <br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/36c/d37/31f/36cd3731fdc514d08db6d100df91ffec.jpg" alt="image"></a> <br>  This was generally done in near darkness. <br><br>  And here is a comparison with my phone (Xperia Z): <br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/604/7f5/0ea/6047f50eac66eb302f054de8ec5c5386.jpg" alt="image"></a> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/364/985/843/3649858431a38e504a62d4f3b2b314a7.jpg" alt="image"></a> <br><br>  Video example: <br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/VX4n3oITTnQ%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700019,15700186,15700190,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhh9ZiDYbkZ6zp68ofYZxftQS_YGqQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><h4>  Findings: <br></h4>  A very interesting device that photographs much better than a phone, but not the size of a system camera or a DSLR.  And what is more important, there is no hemorrhoid "to photograph on the camera, transfer it to the phone, send it", as is the case with WiFi cards in ordinary cameras, the photos immediately appear on the phone. <br>  Minuses?  Well, there is little.  It is necessary to charge once a couple of days, adds seriously to the thickness of the phone - in the pocket of jeans or shirts together no longer shove, you have to disconnect.  Get the phone and click will not come out, how not accelerate - less than 6-8 seconds before the first photo does not work, time is spent on downloading the program and the connection. <br><br>  This is not a replacement for the camera of the phone, and in the tasks of ‚Äúquickly clicking on a sheet of text‚Äù it easily merges the built-in camera.  But if you go somewhere for a walk, to an exhibition, a conference, to study - to throw such a thing into a backpack will not be superfluous.  We occupy places incomparably smaller than a normal camera, and provide acceptable, if not good, then pictures. <br><br>  PS I know that this is now called a smart scanner, but I have a headache from this word. <br><br><h4>  <font color="#C98437">‚ñ∫</font> Links <br></h4><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/646/7e3/c69/6467e3c6977c4ccedfbe35655cde8e4f.png" alt="image">  <a href="http://www.sony.ru/product/dsc-qx-series/dsc-qx10">Offsite page</a> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ed0/f7b/582/ed0f7b5824ab06080013c7ef95d5a7c0.png" alt="image">  <a href="http://www.mobile-review.com/articles/2013/sony-qx10.shtml">MobileReview Overview</a> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ca0/59e/8b1/ca059e8b168d10d044bb3c33582fa8ca.png" alt="image">  <a href="http://hi-tech.mail.ru/review/misc/Sony-DSC-QX10-prev.html">Review from Hi-Tech@Mail.ru</a> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e44/453/9ca/e444539ca603937358ac952cfafc325e.png" alt="image">  <a href="http://www.3dnews.ru/771274">3dnews review</a> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/41d/d73/056/41dd730569da1a10d0c0474994b38dc5.png" alt="image">  <a href="http://digit.ru/columnists/20131121/408350811.html">Digit.ru Review</a> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/db5/4f0/db2/db54f0db2398b0fcb34909c7efc84dc3.png" alt="image">  <a href="http://www.ferra.ru/ru/digiphoto/review/IFA-2013-Sony-Cyber-shot-QX10-QX100-smartograph-lens-camera/">Review from Ferra.ru</a> <br><br>  If someone from Sony or their resellers reads me, I have a desire to test the older brother of this lens (QX100), if someone wants to offer it to me, please email vvzvlad@gmail.com. <br><br>  If you do not have an account in Habr√©, you can read and discuss this article on our website: <a href="http://boxoverview.com/reviews/gadget/sony-qx-10-ili-obektiv-s-vajfaem">BoxOverview.com</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/203916/">https://habr.com/ru/post/203916/</a></p>
