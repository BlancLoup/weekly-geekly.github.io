Such large projects without a technical assignment usually do not, but before you start it, you need to decide on the conditions of what we all want from the planet.  Some of them I ventured to list. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/d3b/9d0/d2c/d3b9d0d2c544e6f05dd81e64be5d338e.png"><br><h5>  Conditions </h5><br><h6>  Gravity </h6><br>  Gravity I think that should be the same as the Earth, but you can think about options.  If you slightly reduce the force of gravity, some things can be made easier, for example: to transport cargo, fly on airplanes or even on simpler aircraft.  But on the other hand, the weak force of attraction will not be able to properly hold the atmosphere, so this option does not suit us and leave gravity alone. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h6>  Size of the planet </h6><br>  With the correct internal structure of the planet, you can slightly increase its diameter, without changing the force of gravity.  So I think this approach is quite reasonable.  You can also change the shape, flatten or stretch out, but I do not see any benefit in these manipulations, so leave the shape spherical and slightly flattened from the sides.

    <h6>  The slope of the planet and the moon </h6><br>  Let's leave these parameters alone.  Any changes to them do not carry anything good.  But I think that a ring like Saturn can be added - beautiful! <br><br><h6>  Land to Ocean Ratio </h6><br>  In my opinion it is better not to change this ratio in order not to disturb the natural balance.  Perhaps on Earth, ideal conditions for life are associated with this ratio, but you can always increase a little land in moderately continental areas at the expense of polar regions. <br><br><h6>  Sushi form </h6><br><ul><li>  The sushi form should provide many parameters, here are some of them: </li><li>  Access to marine vessels in all residential areas. </li><li>  Convenient undercurrents that do not disturb the natural balance. </li><li>  The ability to quickly move on trains throughout. </li><li>  Mountain ranges are located in such a way as not to create hurricanes, tornadoes, etc., but the movement of air masses must be uniform for all territories. </li><li>  Volcanoes are located in such a way that in the event of an eruption it is possible to quickly evacuate people to other territories, as well as to prevent the ashes from them from interfering with traffic flows and the extraction of mineral resources. </li></ul><br><br><h6>  Minerals </h6><br>  Concentrate in one place different or dispel all a little for each area?  I tend to ensure that each of the minerals is in 2-3 places so that you can deploy large capacity for mining.  If all minerals are located in each territory little by little, then this will lead to uneven consumption, idle capacity and, ultimately, the first option. <br><br><h6>  Localization of animals, insects </h6><br>  If you make all areas similar, the species diversity will be greatly reduced, but you can only grow the necessary animals.  We are building the planet from scratch.  Unlike minerals, animals are better placed on different sites in the same area, so that during epidemics you can create quarantine zones. <br><br><h6>  Resort and resource zones </h6><br>  Each territory should include both places for entertainment and for work.  It is necessary that the territory is not empty.  It is better to locate them in areas with a temperate climate and make them slightly elongated along the meridians, so that from one side there is a tropical climate, and on the other - moderate. <br><br><h5>  My idea of ‚Äã‚Äãsuch a planet </h5><br>  It should be something like a truncated icosahedron.  The areas should be hexagonal, perhaps slightly elongated along the meridians.  Most of them should be absent.  The rest should be mainly located on the sides of the equator.  At the equator itself there are enough 4 such areas, as in the polar regions.  Unfortunately, I can not draw. <br><br><h6>  And what, in your opinion, the necessary conditions for the planet are still needed? </h6></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/189476/">https://habr.com/ru/post/189476/</a></p>
