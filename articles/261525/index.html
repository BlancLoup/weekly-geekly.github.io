  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How to control response time or how fast your website loads?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  It is well known that server response time has a direct impact on the indexing of a website by a search engine.  The longer the site is loaded, the lower it is ranked, and low search results have a number of negative consequences: fewer visitors from search traffic, a decrease in conversion rates, an increase in the number of refusals, and the like.  Response time is the time when a server responds to client requests, which is most often a web browser.  Response time directly affects the speed of loading web pages, so these two characteristics are often confused.  <a href="http://www.host-tracker.com/">HostTracker</a> offers a function to measure this time from different countries and continents. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ac0/b56/ca9/ac0b56ca9497460ba6404e2c7ba07b3c.png"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h5>  Linking seo and response time </h5><br>  The Internet contains a lot of various statistics of various degrees of utility.  For example, you can find a study of the dependence of the position of the site in the search results from its response time.  Search robots also love websites that load quickly - websites with good response times, ceteris paribus, are often located in the top search results positions.  What is this good time?  Of course, this depends on the category of the site, since different types of sites by default contain different amounts of content and different buns.  But for most sites, a good download time of 0.35-0.38 s is considered.  Such a time, as a rule, is demonstrated by sites with TOP search engines based on popular requests.  Up to one second is also considered a good result, but the total position can be affected by a difference of only 0.1 or 0.2 s.  Of course, content and relevance are still in the first place in terms of their impact on search results, but with the current level of competition, good webmasters take into account more and more factors.

      It is logical that when measuring response time it is necessary to take into account the geographical location of the server with the site.  If a user from Iceland suddenly decides to climb on Australian sites - then he certainly will experience some discomfort.  After all, the farther away from the server is the user who wants to open pages located on it, the more hosts will go to him through the answer, and the processing on each of them takes some time (we‚Äôll keep silent about the finite light speed).  Therefore, it is highly desirable to place your website as close as possible to your target audience.  For global sites, the problem is solved using a CDN (Content Delivery Network). <br><br><h5>  Response time monitoring </h5><br>  Host-Tracker provides several server response time tracking capabilities.  Firstly, the response time from different parts of the world is recorded with an instant check, available free of charge even for unregistered users.  If you are interested in statistics, monitoring from a specific region, or alerts about time exceeding - then you can use the function "Check response time";  Also, this function is available when setting up the ‚ÄúSite Check (http)‚Äù task - the response time is configured in the advanced settings of the HTTP task. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/0f6/679/1f6/0f66791f667442f3a98d405efcfc6a3d.jpg"><br><br>  In the settings you can specify the maximum allowable response time for your site.  If the server did not respond within the time set in the ‚ÄúTimeout‚Äù field, then Host-Tracker will send a message that the site has started to ‚Äúslow down‚Äù.  By the way, this can be useful even if you do not fight for a fraction of a second - a sudden or gradual increase in response time may indicate various technical work carried out on the server, or an overload of the web server by the hosting company. <br><br>  It is also important to pay attention to the region from which to check, since the response time is highly dependent on the geography of the site.  This option is configured in the list of advanced settings of the task. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/aca/1b1/66e/aca1b166e35b4628856a424cd00f04c9.jpg"><br><br><h5>  Conclusion </h5><br>  As you can see, <a href="http://www.host-tracker.com/">HostTracker</a> can help.  The researchers call the most acceptable response value 0.5 s, which is very important for indexing a site and for its ranking.  Given the geography, this value can be expected about 1-3 seconds.  If the response value stably turns out to be greater than the specified value, then you need to think about changing the hosting or site optimization. <br></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/261525/">https://habr.com/ru/post/261525/</a></p>
