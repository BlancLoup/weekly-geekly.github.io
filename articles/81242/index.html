  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Student placement</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  What do students expect from their institutions?  What are university education expectations?  One thing I can say for sure is that all this is illusory and erroneous. <br>  Most students still spend their academic years according to the formula "students live happily from session to session."  After such a ‚Äúformula‚Äù, it is erroneous to expect that after obtaining a diploma and a degree, work is much easier to find than before these stages of your life.  Naturally, the calculation does not include a criminal place in the company for a dad / husband / anyone call, a ‚Äúgolden spoon‚Äù, a dedication to spiritual life, and so on.  But everyone needs work and needs to receive it, that is, to sell yourself to an employer. <br><a name="habracut"></a>  For many, obtaining a diploma is a ritual for obtaining passes to high-paying jobs.  It becomes a mantra that you cannot yet think about about the future.  But this is only a waste of time when it is possible, with less risk to reputation, to break wood. <br>  Unfortunately, many students may not know, or may not have enough experience and wisdom to notice that in life there are facts when a person, or rather even a person, without a specialized education, or not having a higher education at all, rather successfully does not work for grandmothers on a fat cat-uncle, but successfully builds and manages his business. <br>  These self-made cases are the clearest example that everything really depends on us and on our activity. <br>  Student years give an incredible and ‚Äúpurely useful‚Äù reason for their activity in the field of education of the architect, designers, copywriter, programmer, to some extent a lawyer, in general, all professions that, in addition to fundamental knowledge, require ambiguity in their application and creativity. <br>  After graduating from the university and when reading the vacancies, many people are embarrassed by the phrase ‚Äúwork experience‚Äù, since the majority of this experience doesn‚Äôt have the hard days of the ordeal of working out this experience. <br>  Much of this can be avoided and by the end of the university, not only to gain the necessary work experience, but also to assemble a decent portfolio of the following actions: <br>  - to take part in as many contests as possible, including foreign ones (this does not require a good knowledge of a foreign language, but knowing the language is not only useful, but necessary).  The more contests, the more assessments of your abilities.  The more contests, the more you understand what to focus your attention on in your work.  The more contests, the more chances to win prizes.  The more contests, the bigger and more interesting your portfolio becomes.  And your portfolio becomes really creative, and not two or three works sucked from your finger in two days, so that you can show something to your employer; <br>  - Try yourself as an intern.  And try in two organizations to understand the organization of processes and their types.  This will further avoid the risk of getting into an office with an unfavorable ‚Äúclimate‚Äù; <br>  - read the special sites for your activities and if it is clear that one company has concluded an order with another company for the implementation and implementation of an idea, make this idea for yourself.  If you do this and send it to a company that has already implemented this idea, your chances of making friends with your employer for the future increase dramatically.  It is necessary to live not only the present, but also the future. <br>  You just need to understand that the student for the employer is one of the many products on the shelf.  And what product, that is, the student, will be chosen by the employer, depends on the student. </div>
