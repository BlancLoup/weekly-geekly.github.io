      It all starts with the awakening of psychological endurance.  Until now, coping with everything that life presents presents you, in the main, were helped by skills, not perseverance, dedication and conscious will effort. <br><br>  Fortunately, there are some fairly simple techniques that everyone ‚Äî from ‚ÄúFur Seals‚Äù to participants in the United States ‚Äî use to maintain psychological stability.  Begin to introduce these <a href="http://testutor.ru/blog/utrennij-rezhim-kak-preuspevayushhie-lyudi-nachinayut-svoj-den/">good morning habits</a> , and then you can become just as strong person. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0071c5">1. They use positive internal dialogue</font> </h2><br>  According to the researchers, every minute we mentally pronounce from 300 to 1000 words.  That is why the American "Fur Seals" infinitely believe: a positive internal dialogue is a way to survive a busy day. <br><br>  If at that moment, when they are under water, their oxygen supply suddenly stops, "Kittens" are able to overcome this situation, repeating to themselves that everything is fine, and continuing to think positively.  Most likely, this advice will allow you to endure the <a href="http://blog.mbaconsult.ru/blog/personal/pochemu-ne-stoit-krasit-steny-ofisa-v-belyy-tsvet/">day in the office</a> . <br><br>  To get started, getting to work on the subway or sitting behind the wheel of a car, tell yourself how cool your day will be.  And if the morning turned out to be inhospitable, leave the office for a couple of minutes and repeat some more positive affirmations. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0071c5">2. They represent the problem resolution process.</font> </h2><br>  American Olympic champions during a marathon or endless swimming training as an effective way to maintain the mood use visualization. <br><br>  At the same time, they do not just present themselves at the finish line, but see how they do everything they need on the machine.  This is a scientifically proven method of developing your willpower, which works flawlessly, regardless of whether you jump over obstacles or do paperwork. <br><br>  Visualizing in the morning how you cope with the task, you not only build confidence in yourself that everything will work out, but also come up with unexpected ways out of the situation between times. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0071c5">3. First of all they solve the most complex tasks.</font> </h2><br>  Here is what psychologically enduring entrepreneurs have noticed: you need to start a working day by doing the largest or most unpleasant task.  It has been scientifically proven that motivation and willpower are exhaustible resources that run out during the day.  Therefore, by preparing ‚Äúthe largest fish‚Äù in the first place, you guarantee that you have enough energy to complete the current business.  In addition, everything that follows it will seem to you a mere trifle. <br><br>  Tip from the pros: do not allow yourself in the morning to link in the responses to emails.  Send only the most significant messages, and leave less important messages for the time when you will be finished with the main projects. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0071c5">4. They do not give up their power.</font> </h2><br>  How many times has it occurred to you that something like ‚Äúmother-in-law will drive me crazy‚Äù? <br><br>  TED Talk star and motivation expert Amy Maureen says that such thoughts "take your power away."  Instead of thinking that you are going to lose your temper because of the mother-in-law (or that the working day is stressful), Maureen recommends using a useful alternative: ‚Äúthe world is what I create it.‚Äù <br><br>  Take away the confidence that you have to get up early and go to hard work, and begin to see it as an opportunity to succeed and influence the world.  Believing that you are at the helm, you will really begin to rule. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0071c5">5. They avoid comparisons (and Twitter)</font> </h2><br>  If among your morning habits is checking Facebook and scrolling your Instagram tape, then you start the day incorrectly.  Amy Maureen also says that seeing the ‚Äúideal‚Äù friends on Facebook in the morning hurts her all day.  It's simple: you see someone's cutting with the best moments, and not real life.  And this occupation does not bring anything except the feeling of <a href="http://blog.mbaconsult.ru/blog/personal/kak-otklyuchit-vnutrennego-kritika-i-ignorirovat-stremlenie-k-sovershenstvu/">its own insignificance</a> and the malicious need to ‚Äúconform‚Äù. <br><br>  According to one wise remark: ‚ÄúThe only person with whom you should compare yourself is who you were yesterday.‚Äù  Giving up social media and <a href="http://blog.mbaconsult.ru/blog/personal/perezagruzka-svoey-zhizni-1/">concentrating on self-improvement</a> is a far more accurate start to the day. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0071c5">6. They exercise and put their health first.</font> </h2><br>  Scientifically proven: physical strength is an integral part of psychological endurance.  Doing aerobic exercise reduces anxiety and stress and gives other amazing results.  Not surprisingly, the most successful people, before going to work, direct their energy to physical activity. <br><br>  And, of course, there is no greater proponent of exercise and proper nutrition than Michelle Obama, who said in an interview with Oprah Winfrey: <br><blockquote>  ‚ÄúIf I had to get up early to take care of my children, I would do that.  But when it really comes to you, it suddenly turns out: "Oh, I can not get up at 4:30."  Therefore, you need to make changes.  If I don‚Äôt practice, I‚Äôll feel bad.  I will get depressed. ‚Äù </blockquote><br>  Being an active entrepreneur, you can take risks, but spending a small amount of time on healthy eating and <a href="http://blog.mbaconsult.ru/blog/personal/7-sovetov-zanimatsya-fizkulturoy/">caring for your own body</a> is an investment that gives you 10-fold profit. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0071c5">7. Before work, they communicate with their loved ones</font> </h2><br>  Being an effective executive director doesn‚Äôt mean sacrificing everything for work.  Even the busiest people in the world know that psychological endurance cannot be maintained without a full-fledged personal life. <br><br>  For example, President Obama takes time to have breakfast and dinner with his wife and daughters.  And he helps Malia and Sasha get ready for school in the morning. <br><br>  It doesn't matter if you are talking about a friend or family member - you need to chat with someone at the beginning of the day.  This will support the relationship, as well as allow you to objectively perceive the situation, while maintaining a good mood while working. <br><br>  PS We recommend another useful article on the work on oneself - the <a href="http://testutor.ru/blog/nauka-o-tom-kak-razvit-duxovnuyu-stojkost-v-rabote-i-v-zhizni/">science of how to develop spiritual endurance in work and in life</a> . <br><br>  The author of the translation is Vyacheslav Davidenko, the founder of the <a href="http://testutor.ru/">TESTutor</a> company. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/308386/">https://habr.com/ru/post/308386/</a></p>
