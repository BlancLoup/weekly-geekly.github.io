What do little Americans like?  Teddy bears.  What do older Americans like?  Teddy bears with a camera in the eye!  In online stores such thing is quite expensive.  Not that I set myself the specific goal of getting such a bear at any cost.  Do not think I'm not a fool and not a pervert.  I just had an old Chinese phone with two cameras and a teddy bear for a long time (sad story, from where I have a teddy bear, I will share it some other time).  So I decided to try to make such a spy bear with my own hands.  The idea, as it seemed to me, lay on the surface.  The phone is an ideal donor for such an undertaking, because besides using the camera itself and the phone‚Äôs memory, we can use the Wi-Fi module of the phone to stream video ... After some thought, I got down to business.  The process itself took not too much time, the main thing in all this action is <s>not to drink for some time to</s> be able to solder small parts. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  To begin with, I disassembled the phone and, surprisingly, found a camera unit soldered to the motherboard on the back panel.  Having discharged the block from the motherboard, I began to look for a train, which was supposed to help the camera get into the outside world.  By the way, the good old ATA / IDE 80 was lying around in my drawer. The thing is that ATA / IDE 80 has 80 wires in a row, between which there is enough distance so that they can be easily separated.  It doesn‚Äôt matter how to put a loop, as long as there are 26 contacts (that‚Äôs what is needed for one camera).  Attention!  A long loop will interfere, so it‚Äôs important to know when to stop.  Soldering the contacts of the camera with the contacts of the cable, turned out to be the longest exercise, which required steel nerves and considerable effort.  The connectors and boards are very small, so I had to use a magnifying glass and a thin soldering iron.  Having soldered the camera to one end of the loop, the other one, naturally, I connected to the motherboard.  In the process of soldering, I, as expected, eloquently regretted that I got involved in it, cursed the Chinese and sincerely sympathized with the jewelers. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/8b5/424/835/8b5424835718468bb171a41c62139c52.JPG"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/764/18f/c8f/76418fc8f08d4d85a9cdb149140bc698.JPG">

      Fortunately, apart from this, there were no particular difficulties in the process of creating a plush spy. <br><br>  Full of pride, I proceeded to the decorative part, namely, the modernization of the teddy.  The following are the revelations of the maniac: I took the bear and ripped it along the seam.  I felt like ‚ÄúDr. Evil‚Äù and I liked it.  He pulled an eye, which, as it turned out, was attached on the principle of rivet.  I cut off the protruding part and drilled a hole in the eye for the camera. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/5b0/23f/48d/5b023f48d2e546239eec1547c9de61b0.jpg"><br><br>  He fixed the camera, inserted the phone into the bear's head, and glued the eye on the glue to the bear.  I also remembered that the phone somehow needs to be charged.  I had to rip the poor bear again, only now from below.  He put the charge in the phone, spent the wire from the bottom of the toy, plugged it into the outlet.  I shoved all the contents of the bear back, sewn up.  Now the spy bear is ready! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e65/a11/fe7/e65a11fe7a6146bc99487577206eb46c.jpg"></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/235301/">https://habr.com/ru/post/235301/</a></p>
