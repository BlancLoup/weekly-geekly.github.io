That was suddenly remembered. <br><br>  For the first time with a computer collided in the 70s.  Parents of geophysics worked on computers like PSS (machines for processing seismic data).  Bulbs there was Nemer.  There was something like a plotter.  Drew myself curves. <br><br>  Then on one of the birthdays my parents bought me a toy computer.  It was possible to simulate the simplest binary operations.  Introduction to Boolean algebra so to speak.

      In the late seventies, he met with BESM-6.  Has occupied the whole building in two floors.  I became acquainted in the sense that I saw this colossus with my eyes.  Magnetic drives occupied the whole room.  The very magnetic tape in the reels with a bang diverged from summer residents.  Shielded cottages, tied up trees.  And the shells themselves were a great place for storing radio components, bolts, screws. <br><br>  In the early 80s, when he was a student at the Kharkov Institute of Radio Electronics, he saw NAIRI.  They wrote on FORTRAN, then punched cards (they really were punched cards).  The resulting pile carried in the engine room.  The operator has run your pack into a reader - this is something like the current banknote counters.  Since the machine worked as an interpreter, the program stopped at your very first error, you were given your pack of punched cards, a printout until the moment of error, and a goodbye.  After that you looked for an error, corrected the map and again into the computer room.  There were dozens of such a walker. <br><br>  By the way, Nairi occupied only one room. <br><br>  The next computer I had to meet was DZ-28.  There was no monitor, the keyboard is designed to enter information in hexadecimal code.  They wrote in assembler, then they were manually translated into a hexadecimal code on paper interpretation and also manually entered.  It was possible to write the code on punched tapes or on magnetic tape (the recording went on a regular MK-60 tape).  By the way, a little later, being in the Leningrad Physics and Engineering Department, I saw the DZ-28 with monitors. <br><br>  Then there were the DCK, Yamaha, EC-1841, Spark (already with a screw).  And I remembered eight inch floppy disks.  Nightmare, here are the sheets. <br><br>  Then the desktop circuits appeared in the radio, but they didn‚Äôt have to face them live.  And only in 1993 I saw the first IBM XT. <br>  Not counting, of course, the <a href="http://igrushka.kz/vip27/bumkom.shtml">paper version</a> . <br><br>  And how the memory and RAM took care.  Words can not convey On the screw in 10 megabytes stood DOS, turbo assembler, macro assembler, C ++, clipper, carat, utility norton, norton itself, of course, and even a lot of toys. <br><br>  And now a toy in 10 Gig is a common thing.  Mess! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/12588/">https://habr.com/ru/post/12588/</a></p>
