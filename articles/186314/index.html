In this post I want to tell you how you can easily lose a domain with a 1.5 million daily attendance. <br><br>  Versions on the Internet roamed the most different: from the new law to the good old complaints of the right holders <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/1e8/ee0/45e/1e8ee045e6464ad87ae69af7873ac6ab.png"><br>  The new address of the service <a href="http://pleer.com/">Pleer.com</a> . <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Two months ago, I took up the project closely and all the time began to devote him: I made the software completely free, I started writing new chips and decided to put everything in order with the zoo of domain names.  The task was to collect all the project domains from one normal registrar.  This would allow from a single point to manage ns-records and not to miss the dates of payments. <br><br>  The domain transfer process is very simple: you need to ask the new registrar to confirm acceptance of the domain and to receive a push password from the old registrar, which should be reported to the new one.  All these operations have been done, it remains only to wait for the result. 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>
        <script>
          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      Suddenly, our old registrar idotz.net, instead of confirming the transfer and saying goodbye to us, asked to ‚Äúremove illegal content from the service‚Äù and ‚Äúconfirm the data of Whois records documented‚Äù.  Idotz set aside 48 hours for this. <br><br>  I did not attach much importance to this letter and created a ticket in their system with the question of what kind of content should be removed and what will happen in 48 hours.  The answer was, alas, in rude form: <br><blockquote>  Since you are in accordance with ICANN requirements. </blockquote><br>  What literally means ‚ÄúKohl, you decided to argue with us, instead of providing supporting documentation, your account is permanently blocked.  Domains will be frozen in accordance with ICANN requirements. ‚Äù <br><br>  Idotz behaved inadequately, obviously, I didn‚Äôt argue with anyone, they decided to punish me and immediately blocked the domain, not waiting for the end of their 48 hours. <br><br>  Domain blocking had a sobering effect, and I quickly began to fuss in several directions: the site picked up at prostopleer.net;  sent a request to one of the domain name selection services;  Began to solve the problem with unlocking the domain. <br><br>  Initially, the domain was registered with some fictional data, since no one thought that the project would be used by anyone and it would gain such popularity.  Nevertheless, I clearly remembered that half a year ago I had replaced them with real ones and immediately sent Idotz a scan of my passport.  As it turned out, Idotz changed the data only in its panel, but did not change the information on Whois.  From me now it was required to confirm the data from Whois. <br><br>  <a href="http://www.idotz.net/Invoice.cfm%3FOrderID%3D601211247476">www.idotz.net/Invoice.cfm?OrderID=601211247476</a> , the panel of the registrar <br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/dc4/398/db6/dc4398db683871e3e94e2c3ca180e101.png"><br></a> <br><br>  I did not argue and swear with Idotz, saying that they did not change the Whois data in time.  Every day a lot of domains are registered for fictitious data, which means there should be an easy way to change them.  I dug over the whole Runet, but I found almost no valuable information on this issue.  Apparently, not many people encountered locks.  Then the decision came to be honest with Idotz and I said that the registration data was indicated random, but now I ask for help with solving this problem and I am ready to provide any documents.  In response, I received an adamant "provide proof of whois data." <br><br>  There were not many solutions to this problem: <br><ul><li>  To persuade, offer money and blame them so that they simply unlock the domain, at least without transfer. </li><li>  Urgently look for a new domain and run the service on it.  I haven‚Äôt liked prostopleer for a long time.  it is quite long and completely incomprehensible to foreign audiences.  On one domain selection service I was offered a lot of options, the most interesting of them: pleerok.com, wowmuz.com and many similar ones. </li><li>  Try to buy the domain pleer.com, which I have long been staring at.  This is a successful 5-character domain associated with the old name.  In addition, it turned out that the current owner from Moscow and with him you can negotiate. </li><li>  Forge documents that meet the requirements. </li></ul><br><br>  At first, I offered Idotz money, said I was ready to pay, only help to resolve the issue, but was refused.  After that, it was decided to go on the longest journey and the least enjoyable.  I found in one forum a person who draws documents and made him an order for a passport in his hands and a utility bill.  I sent my photo for work, where I hold a Russian passport, and he promised to replace it with a Latvian one.  The man puffed all day and, late at night, he still gave the result, which I was very pleased with. <br><br>  I hold my passport in my hands (click to enlarge) <br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/172/cd1/338/172cd1338a681c8115d03d1fa2e68a1a.jpg"><br></a> <br><br>  Passport scan (click to enlarge): <br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/0f0/944/54d/0f094454dd3ffcfd69157ff1e5769e73.jpg"><br></a> <br><br>  Scan billing for communal (click to enlarge): <br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/5e5/50f/b23/5e550fb23105e18767b7955a66696d90.jpg"><br></a> <br><br>  Then I calmed down and began to wait for the moment of unlocking.  I was sure that Idotz would not sit with a magnifying glass and invite experts, but they would accept documents and unlock the domain.  On the third day of the passport, they issued a verdict - a fake! <br><br>  On the second day of problems with the domain, I still bought the address pleer.com and raised the service on it.  The cost of this was the loss of millions of embed codes with the player, placed on all corners of the Internet.  I also lost the trust of users and this is very disgusting at heart. <br><br>  During the week of these events, I experienced all the stages of accepting death: denial, anger, bidding, depression, acceptance, because  Your favorite project is like a child that you constantly think about, you are constantly engaged in it, and losing a project is very painful, attendance has dropped critically and is unlikely to return to previous heights. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/1ea/e1a/5c4/1eae1a5c4795492f05b0788792e7b4f6.png"><br><br>  I have the last hope that there are people on Habr√© who can share their advice. <br>  Perhaps there are owners of diary, LJ and Li.ru on Habr√© and they will be able to immediately replace all users in embeds with links from prostopleer.com to pleer.com, so that people can make music on blogs. <br><br>  upd.  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/prostopleer/blog/187644/">the second part of</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/186314/">https://habr.com/ru/post/186314/</a></p>
