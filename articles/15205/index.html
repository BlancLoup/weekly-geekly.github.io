In my opinion, subscribers are the basis of a successful blog. <br>  I present to you 10 simple, but effective strategies, starting to apply which, you will increase the number of subscribers in the near future. <br><ol><li>  <strong>Make your subscription easier.</strong>  Make the elements of the subscription of your blog more noticeable, place the offer to subscribe at the end of each post, offer as an alternative to the RSS subscription by email. </li><li>  <strong>Focus on one topic.</strong>  Focus on any one topic, and the more specialized it is, the better.  Evaluate your chosen niche - are there many potential readers?  It is better to be honest with yourself initially than to work hard and end up with nothing. </li><li>  <strong>Let's take bribes.</strong>  Do not worry - there is no crime here.  We are talking about moral bribes in the form of free e-books, articles, training courses or sound recordings.  It is believed that this technique works only with subscribers to the email newsletter, since you can attach the bonus attachment to the letter.  However, there is one clever way to do this with RSS. <br>  If your blog is powered by RSS, use the free <a href="http://www.text-link-ads.com/feedvertising">Feedvertising</a> plugin, which allows you to create a ‚Äútricky‚Äù link to the page with a bonus.  This link will be displayed only in the feed, and it will not be in the post itself.  Thus, only subscribers will get access to bonuses. </li><li>  <strong>Distribute your e-books.</strong>  This is one of the varieties of the strategy of "moral bribes", but in this case the e-book (of course, with a "embedded" link to the blog or a proposal to subscribe) is distributed to your friends by your readers.  Thus, the e-book will promote your site and increase the number of subscribers. </li><li>  <strong>Create a subscription page.</strong>  Create a page on the site that will be devoted solely subscription.  Visitors to this page can come from your blog, contextual advertising or from anywhere else.  You can even place it on a separate domain and use the already mentioned ‚Äúmoral bribes‚Äù to attract interest. </li><li>  <strong>Allow me to copy your content.</strong>  Someone seems to be a stupid idea to allow everyone to copy the content of their blog, however, in fact, this is a very effective strategy to attract visitors and increase the subscriber base.  Discuss in advance with the author of the blog for which you are writing that at the end of the article there must be a link to your blog. </li><li>  <strong>Record podcasts on your topic and share them.</strong>  In each episode of the podcast, mention your blog and talk about the benefits that your subscribers receive.  Try to interview any of the famous players in your niche.  By the way, podcasts are a great example of bonuses for subscribers. </li><li>  <strong>Write on the forums.</strong>  Be an active participant in forums that are authoritative in your niche, try to write more.  When people see that you have something to tell, they will surely visit your blog in the hope of finding something special there.  Do not disappoint them. </li><li>  <strong>Make friends.</strong>  Perhaps this is the most underused strategy for attracting traffic to the blog and increasing the number of subscribers.  Do not solicit links from other bloggers, as this is not effective.  Find a way to help them in any way.  As a result, business relationships and even friendships may arise.  And surely these people will not only become your subscribers, but will regularly quote you on their blogs. </li><li>  <strong>Promote each other.</strong>  Here is another interesting way to use <a href="http://www.text-link-ads.com/feedvertising">Feedvertising</a> for WordPress. <br>  Find a blogger who writes related topics.  Agree that you will promote each other's blogs on the RSS feed using Feedvertising.  Thus, both of you will increase both traffic to the blog and the number of subscribers. </li></ol><br>  Translation: <a href="http://www.seowrite.ru/">Damir Khalilov</a> <br><br>  <strong>Related articles:</strong> <br>  <a href="http://www.seowrite.ru/%3Fp%3D140">How to find time for blogging</a> <br>  <a href="http://www.seowrite.ru/%3Fp%3D153">10 ways to make your blog attractive to advertisers</a> <br>  <a href="http://www.seowrite.ru/%3Fp%3D167">Effective blogging: tips from the stars of the blogosphere</a> </div>
