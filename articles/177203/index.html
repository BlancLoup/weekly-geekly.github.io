      And, really - when you take on big business, it is subsequently difficult to remember what was separately fascinating.  But in 22 years we have accumulated enough to talk with you, dear reader.  During this time, the flight never turned into a fall, and our mission continues. <br><br>  Initially, we‚Äôll warn you: this is not just a monologue in a hub that needs to be learned as it is.  This is an invitation to dialogue. <br>  To talk about what is " <i>good</i> " and what is " <i>bad</i> ."  It is, after all, an invitation to cooperate, but by no means arrogantly ranting about how beautiful we are. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Although, beauty, we really do not hold;) <br><br>  But let's move on to the main thing - the story of what kind of a spacecraft is this - <a href="http://r-style.com/">R-Style</a> . <br>  What are his mission and place in the chain of information technology world?  Well, if 22 years is a significant life span of any person, then a similar age among Russian information technologies is saying something. <br><br>  First, that we managed to survive the dashing 90s, to build and establish a business, to prove our own usefulness and expertise, even if it was not easy.  Few people know that R-Style was initially a highly diversified business: the company combined production (assembly), distribution, service, banking software, regional offices, and so on.  Then it was justified, because the prospects were foggy, but over time, it became clear that it was necessary to combine key activities under the same roof. <br><br>  It is from this that the restructuring of 2011 began, in fact, which changed the face of the company and brought everything to its current form: a large integrator solving large, complex tasks.  Without ragged communications, disintegration and other diseases strongly distributed by the purposes of businesses. <br><br>  The overall growth of professionalism, which has greatly changed the Russian IT market over the past 10 years, also played a major role. <br>  Plus, the development of the Internet as a whole has led to the fact that we have shifted from hardware to infrastructure, service and application projects, in many respects - for the state customer. <br><br>  Then it became clear that R-Style did not concentrate on the low-margin and high-risk business, so it was decided to abandon it altogether (mostly, they were ‚Äúconsumer‚Äù areas), in order to concentrate all forces on a large corporate sector - so-called .  Enterprise. <br><br>  And, since 2005, we have accomplished with our company what IBM once did, abandoning "production" and switching to the creation and maintenance of "services" aimed at solving very specific business problems.  In many ways, thanks to this, we met the crisis of 2008, which hit the whole economy painfully, fully armed, and were ready for any market fluctuations. <br><br>  At the same time, a big goal was adopted - to become one of the leaders in the field of integration of complex and voluminous projects in all sectors of the economy.  At today's 2013, we can say that it was possible.  But we will not run ahead, because we will tell readers about the most interesting projects;) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/227/6a0/f47/2276a0f47e0b6ba5b008be5c6afdb5fe.jpg"><br>  <sup>Our main astronauts: Sergey Serikov (director of business solutions department), Vasily Vasin (general designer), Alexander Lanin (director of integration technologies department) and IDC expert</sup> <br><br>  With the growth of the company, everything is clear - we would hardly have written about our work here, if it hadn‚Äôt been noticeable, we‚Äôll try to briefly talk about what, in fact, we are doing, and at the same time set goals for more detailed stories about each of the cases separately. <br><br>  <i>By the way - if you are interested in a certain moment, do not hesitate to ask in the comments, we will listen to your opinion and try to shape the appearance of the hub according to the wishes of the accomplices</i> . <br><br>  It is hardly worth mentioning separately the fact that any integrator, by virtue of his profile and business goals, undertakes only <i>truly</i> complex and voluminous tasks.  The integrator business is like a dragon from fairy tales that can easily swallow a cow, but at the same time runs the risk of choking and suffocating from the little bone. <br>  Therefore, we are forced to maintain our own versatility in order to work with any customer, while choosing those areas in which we are strong and to concentrate our own efforts on them.  We are still in the process of selecting key areas for ourselves, but one thing is certain, we will continue to implement projects where the government is the customer. <br><br>  In addition, we, not being ashamed of this phrase, <i>pioneerly</i> , master areas where traditionally Western companies are traditionally considered to be leaders: the financial market, transport, and energy.  Take the same "energy efficiency" - on a small scale we have learned to produce truly energy-efficient systems, but at the level of the whole state, and even the federal district, very few people can imagine how to build such work. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/036/b19/93b/036b1993bfcbe8e6f4092de62a4c1a76.jpg"><br>  <sup>The delegation of journalists at the space press lunch</sup> <br><br><h4>  Trees grow slowly but live long </h4><br>  Strangely enough, but many areas of work of integrators in Russia, and this applies not only to R-Style, took shape only recently, although they were started as early as zero. <br><br>  So, in the mid-2000s, when we spent strength on the acquisition of competencies related to business intelligence, this direction did not look as attractive as it is today, when the demand for such services has grown exponentially. <br><br>  A similar situation with information security, which seriously, not superficially, began to take care only recently, at least in Russia.  There are a lot of sources of active growth - from FZ-152 to the conscious need for ensuring information security of business.  Accordingly, the decisions and technologies that we are able to implement are sufficient.  In particular, after the implementation of some turnkey projects, we ensure their information security to this very day, with very large customers. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/254/44c/26b/25444c26b8f63217f86ffe50aaac0126.jpg"><br>  <sup>Vasily Vasin draws plans for future space missions</sup> <br><br>  One of the company's unique experiences is in the development and implementation of mobile business solutions. <br>  Moreover, the systems are diversified: starting from ‚Äúbanal‚Äù mobile BI solutions, and ending with whole complexes of mobile office work with the possibility of using digital signature, cryptographic protection, allowing to completely replace the stationary workplace of a high-level state leader. <br>  We also have a very specific product in this area called ‚ÄúRS-Patrol‚Äù - this is a complete set of accidents fixation for traffic police: from photos of places of traffic accidents with Glonass / GPS coordinates referenced to operational verification with target databases.  Businessmen more and more often want to be not tied to the office, we are giving this opportunity now, already in completely specific products, ready to use. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/608/43f/eb5/60843feb5ed780a6c9b38fe4f4d37ccd.jpg"><br>  <sup>PC-Patrol interface on an Android device in the hands of a journalist</sup> <br><br>  The company as a whole is very strong in software development.  Do not lie if I say that you can develop anything at all.  This is one of the main directions and one of the key expertise.  We have a staff of developers, system architects and analysts.  We have development centers in Russia and Belarus.  And we actually developed for the entire CIS, and in Russia for all telecom operators, for the FIU and many other respected customers. <br><br>  Finally, the construction of data centers is an area in which there are few players, but each of them is strong in its own way.  Now we have mastered the full cycle, from designing on paper to the turnkey implementation of all engineering systems in the data center, ranging from cooling and power supply systems to security systems, so our expertise in this area is, in our opinion, very high. <br><br>  It should be understood that the data center itself is a concentration of top engineering technologies, each of which is important and necessary in its own way, in the whole mass of projects and implementations.  SCS is required in the office infrastructure;  cooling, power supply and control systems ‚Äî while building intelligent buildings, etc.  Therefore, the data center for us is not just an engineering project, it is the top foundation of our engineering, which shows the maximum of our skills, experience and expertise. <br>  The one who can build a super-modern data center, believe me, can make any IT infrastructure. <br><br>  Of course, in addition to the above, expertise and solutions from the R-Style great variety.  In order not to bore the reader, I‚Äôll tell you more in the following posts.  And if you have questions - ask. <br><br><h4>  Not a single "Gazprom" </h4><br><br>  As a result of all the reading, you could get the impression that we work only with giant customers.  In fact, this is not the case, and although we practically do not provide our services to small businesses, we have many offers for medium-sized companies with modern requirements for IT infrastructure, and the demand for them is just as noticeable. <br><br>  Modern professionals, including the owners of ‚Äúsmart‚Äù business, which is relatively young in Russia so far, as the trends for its normal life activity have appeared quite recently, are well aware that most modern corporate solutions scale to any volume of business.  And our normal customers, say, non-monopolistic businesses, understand this well and are not afraid to work with R-Style. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/479/bb0/245/479bb0245d14cda0904a3f80b9714ea5.jpg"><br>  <sup>Festive cake for Habrakhabr :)</sup> <br><br>  We hope that this information was interesting to you, dear accomplice.  Now please pay attention to this: <br><br><ol><li>  If you are interested in getting to know us better, ask your questions and get answers to them - feel free to do so, in any form.  If you are interested in working in a company or cooperation - do the same! </li><li>  We would like to hear the wishes of the accomplices on the subject of further posts in the Hub.  We have something to tell, the main areas of work of the company are already mentioned here.  If there is something about which you would like to hear our opinion, look at the implemented projects and get the opinion of our specialists - select and ask, we will try to meet the requirements of our readers and only talk about what is interesting to read. </li></ol></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/177203/">https://habr.com/ru/post/177203/</a></p>
