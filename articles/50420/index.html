Today I want to tell you how to write an article about your company on Wikipedia.  At the same time on a specific example, I will introduce the main principles and rules. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h1>  Is it worth writing? </h1><br>  So, the first thing to do is to carefully read the criteria for the significance of <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2592%25D0%259F:%25D0%259A%25D0%2597%25D0%259E">conventional</a> and <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2592%25D0%259F:%25D0%259A%25D0%2597%25D0%259A%25D0%259E">commercial</a> organizations for the encyclopedia.  It is believed that the criteria of significance came up with terrible people who just like to delete articles =).  Your article may also try to delete because of insignificance.  But if your company is a recognized leader in its field, if you have dozens of medals for excellent products, and profits exceed the state budget of an average African country, you are invulnerable. <br>  Attention!  If the significance is not shown in the article and is not confirmed by third-party sources, the article will be deleted anyway. <br><br><h1>  Who am I?  Where I am? </h1><br>  So, Wikipedia is right for you, and you are Wikipedia.  What next?  Register! <br>  It is not difficult to register, even it is not necessary to have an e-mail.  But there are some significant advantages: <br><ul><li>  Articles of interest to you can be added to the watchlist.  Then you can track changes made by other users. </li><li>  You will be able to communicate with you on your discussion page, which is one, in contrast to the discussion pages of anonymous, which change when your provider assigns you a different IP address. </li><li>  Traditionally, the degree of confidence in the registered participant is higher than to the anonymous author. </li></ul><br>  What name to choose?  Roga &amp; Copyta, ltd is clearly not suitable - the degree of confidence in your edits will be zero.  And the article you create, even if it complies with all the rules, will be subconsciously perceived as an advertisement.  Better something neutral like Vasi Pupkin =)

    <h1>  Getting Started </h1><br><h2>  We have everything on the site! </h2><br>  Writing an article! <br>  We are writing, copying from the about section of the site has never brought anyone to good.  There are two reasons for this: <br><ul><li>  People in Caps will delete your article as a clear copyright infringement.  In an hour, maybe two.  If your article lasts a day - you're in luck. <br>  How to avoid it?  And in general, what kind of nonsense?  How can I violate my copyright? <br>  The problem is this: that you are you, nobody knows.  You can confirm your authorship in two ways - by adding the inscription ‚ÄúMaterials are licensed under GFDL (http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/fdl.html)‚Äù to the source text page, or you can follow the instructions on the page <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2592%25D0%259F:%25D0%2594%25D0%259E%25D0%2591%25D0%25A0%25D0%259E">VP: GOOD</a> . </li><li>  Those who compose texts for the ‚Äúabout the company‚Äù page prefer the words ‚Äúbest‚Äù, ‚Äúdynamic‚Äù, ‚Äúleading‚Äù.  For an encyclopedic article such text is not suitable.  Even if not removed, then rewrite. </li></ul><br><br><h2>  Article title </h2><br>  As the title of the article is usually used the name of the company without specifying the form of ownership.  That is, for Roga &amp; Copyta, Ltd.  the title of the article will most likely be ‚ÄúRoga &amp; Copyta‚Äù.  If an article with the same title is already in Wikipedia, then after the title there should be a clarification in brackets - ‚ÄúRoga &amp; Copyta (company)‚Äù. <br>  More information about the naming of articles can be found in the relevant rule - " <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2592%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BF%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B8%25D1%258F:%25D0%2598%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B5_%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D0%25B0%25D1%2582%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B9">Wikipedia: Naming of articles.</a> " <br>  After selecting the name, type in the browser ‚Äúru.wikipedia.org/wiki / &lt;% Name%&gt;‚Äù and click on ‚ÄúCreate an article‚Äù. <br><br><h2>  Content </h2><br>  The subject of the article should be described in literary Russian in a neutral style.  Any emotion (‚ÄúRoga and Copyta FOREVER!‚Äù) Is unacceptable.  Excessive praise or humiliation without reference to independent authoritative sources, too.  All statements in the article must be verified. <br>  The content of Wikipedia articles is governed by several fundamental rules - <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2592%25D0%259F:%25D0%259D%25D0%25A2%25D0%2597">VP: NTZ</a> , <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2592%25D0%259F:%25D0%259F%25D0%25A0%25D0%259E%25D0%2592">VP: PROV</a> , <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2592%25D0%259F:%25D0%2590%25D0%2598">VP: AI</a> . <br><br><h2>  Sources </h2><br>  As mentioned above, all statements in the article must be verifiable and confirmed by <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2592%25D0%259F:%25D0%2590%25D0%2598">authoritative independent sources</a> .  Publications in newspapers, articles in specialized journals, feedback from experts - all this should be searched before writing an article.  The more third-party sources are given, the better.  If there are no such sources at all, the article is a candidate for removal.  If after each sentence there is a footnote, that's just fine. <br>  Separately are links to your company's website as a source.  To confirm the words ‚Äúwe are the best‚Äù, links to the official website are not enough, to confirm the information on the number of employees, the structure of the company, and the management - quite. <br><br><h2>  Registration </h2><br>  As an example for the design and content of an article about a company, <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siemens">Siemens</a> is an excellent choice - a selected article in Russian Wikipedia, one of the best examples. <br>  In general, a wikipart is no more difficult than html, but somewhere even easier.  You can read more about it in <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2592%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BF%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B8%25D1%258F:%25D0%259E%25D1%2584%25D0%25BE%25D1%2580%25D0%25BC%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B5_%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D0%25B0%25D1%2582%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B9">the Wikipedia design guide</a> . <br>  To check the possibilities there is even a special page - a <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2592%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BF%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B8%25D1%258F:%25D0%259F%25D0%25B5%25D1%2581%25D0%25BE%25D1%2587%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D1%2586%25D0%25B0">sandbox</a> where your edits will not hurt anyone. <br><br><h1>  Wrote, what's next? </h1><br>  After the article is written, the best solution would be to ask any of the active editors to check your creation for compliance with the rules.  This can be done by creating a new topic on one of the Wikipedia forums (‚Äú <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2592%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BF%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B8%25D1%258F:%25D0%2592%25D0%25A3">Attention of participants</a> ‚Äù, for example), or by placing the {{helpme}} template on the article's discussion page and describing the request.  Experienced participants will help. <br><br>  In the next series - ‚Äúwhat is worth doing and what is not, if the article was still removed for deletion‚Äù and ‚Äúhow to upload your images correctly (for example, a logo)‚Äù.  This will be rendered in separate articles, as this has turned out too big.  Accepted proposals for the creation of articles on other topics of concern to the public. <br><br>  Remarks to the style, typography, typographical errors, etc., please send in habrakposhtoy and does not apply too harshly - I am still a programmer, not a journalist =) <br><br>  I am pleased to answer your questions. <br>  Respectfully, <br>  <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Track13">Russian Wikipedia administrator Track13</a> <br><br>  UPD1.  In the comments correctly noted that the best way to write a neutral article is to ask others =) <br>  UPD2.  In principle, this guide applies not only to companies. <br></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/50420/">https://habr.com/ru/post/50420/</a></p>
