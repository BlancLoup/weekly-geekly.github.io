  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Street Wars or an attempt to create a MMORPG VKontakte</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  It just so happened that many developers dream of creating a full-fledged RPG in domestic social networks.  Interest in this direction of games is clear: a huge audience in the social network, it is easy to monetize and promote the product.  The truth is to make high-quality MMORPG and unleash it to an acceptable scale so far few have succeeded. <br><br>  And the issue of quality is probably secondary.  The main problem is the willingness of the social network audience to play such games.  Already probably no one is surprised that everything that is more complicated Zuma causes rejection of the brain of an ordinary user.  What to say about full-fledged RPG. <br><br>  Nevertheless, the developers are desperately trying to create something more than a common <s>farm</s> hodilka.

      We invite you to observe the development of the project of our company <a href="http://www.indeeinteractive.com/">INDEE Interactive</a> <a href="http://vkontakte.ru/app1756611">"Street Wars"</a> .  In general, INDEE Interactive is known in media circles as a developer of large interactive projects, but the social direction is becoming more interesting to us. <br><br> <a href="http://vkontakte.ru/app1756611"><img title="Street Wars" alt=" " src="http://img35.imageshack.us/img35/7237/68352858.jpg"></a> <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  It was done initially without a deep understanding of social mechanics; we no longer did a social service, but a game.  We simply realized what we would like to play in and thought that this is the main criterion that will arouse the interest of other users.  First of all, it can be seen on the pumping system - you do not need to call friends or put in votes to grow.  It all depends on the player.  The game is all about the brain, not money.  The ability to correctly calculate which stuff to use will give much more advantages than a fat wallet. <br>  It became interesting to us what kind of audience the application with a pumping system that is not inferior to the system in Bitter 17 (Odium), step-by-step battles and a huge number of weapons and modifiers (a kind of craft) can type. <br><img src="http://img202.imageshack.us/img202/9199/35703569.jpg"><br><br>  As a rule, if the game involves extensive pumping, then in order not to frighten the user with a choice and not unnecessarily strain his brain, at the first levels you can choose from 2-3 almost identical stats.  Another very common technique is not to allow the user to see things on older levels - got level 6, get pants on level 6.  We decided not to lisp with users - in the store the player sees at once all the weapons that are available in the game.  And here the brain of an ordinary user should be torn to pieces from the abundance of characteristics, properties and limitations. <br><br>  I must note that the entrance barrier to the game is very high.  And this is both paradoxical and a plus and a minus game.  The downside to the fact that the game remains, probably, 1% of those who have come for the first time.  But the percentage that remained and figured out the game is people with whom it is pleasant and interesting to play.  The question is whether such people are ready to pay, and if they are ready how much?  The answer will show time. <br><img src="http://img193.imageshack.us/img193/2085/50764123.jpg"><br><br>  It is reasonable to assume that we will gradually ‚Äúrender‚Äù the game and Osocialim in order to attract more audiences.  Moreover, the first step to this has been taken - until recently, the game was called ‚ÄúPress mobile 3‚Äù.  An attempt to attract an audience with jokes and a banter about Gopnik failed, and an aggressive setting scared away some users.  Along with the change of the name, the word ‚Äúgopnik‚Äù, which was present in every second description, was removed from the game. <br>  Also now, in order to support the project, we began to place our mini flash games, which, as we plan, will become traffic generators for the main project - the practice is not new, but we are interested in trying it out.  With toys, by the way, can be found at the links: <br><br> <a href="http://vkontakte.ru/app1896118"><img title="Satellite" alt="" src="http://img805.imageshack.us/img805/7417/sputnikbanner.jpg"></a> <br> <a href="http://vkontakte.ru/app1902953"><img title="Air battle" alt=" " src="http://img408.imageshack.us/img408/1190/airfight.png"></a> <br> <a href="http://vkontakte.ru/app1898685"><img title="Treasure of Heaven" alt=" " src="http://img210.imageshack.us/img210/3482/socrovishbanner.jpg"></a> <br><br>  Summing up, I will say that anyone can witness how a game designed for a thoughtful audience is fighting for survival in casual VKontakte.  We hope, quite an exciting spectacle should turn out. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/99267/">https://habr.com/ru/post/99267/</a></p>
