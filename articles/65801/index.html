  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Full bowl: work at home, with his wife and small child</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  I read the topic about <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/arbeit/65783/">work at home 2 hours a day</a> , as well as comments. <br>  I'll tell you about my experience at home.  I started working at home for a remote customer when my wife was in the last months of pregnancy.  It was a wonderful time.  Nobody says when I get up for work, when I leave work, a lot of time is saved because I don‚Äôt have to spend it on the road, and the work is done surprisingly quickly.  My wife and I walked a lot, spent a lot of time together.  And then a wonderful daughter was born! .. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  While she was very tiny - it worked out great at home.  Most crumbs sleep a lot, and almost do not interfere.  Slightly and for periods only the wife, who demanded help, did not allow to work, because it is difficult to cope with the child alone.  Now everything was almost as before, but instead of having a lot of rest and spending time with my wife - I tried to help her manage the child and the house.  But there was still time left for work and there were no complaints from the customer. <br><br>  Then, when the child was six months old, I began working on a project in the office.  I will not talk about this: what interesting things can be at work in the office ... Work as work.  :) <br><br>  When the project was completed in 2 years, I started working at home again.  The child at that time was 2.5 years old.  As a result, I became the most unhappy and tired man in the world.  My wife thinks that since you are at home, you owe her and the child to pay attention and help.  Arguments about what to do a lot of work - almost do not help, because you're home.  And try to explain something to a two-year-old child.  He simply does not slazit around his neck, or worn around his beloved daddy, shouting something and demanding attention, and this leads to the fact that it is impossible to work at all.  And considering that this is a favorite daughter, she has to pay attention, whatever one may say.  As a result, there is no work during the day, you work only at night after a day full of noise, din and anything else, but not the work day.  As I remember ... In the morning a child wakes up with a wild cry ‚ÄúDaddy!  it's time to get up!  And in the afternoon after a sleepless night there is no mood or desire not only to work, but also to pay attention to the family.  And everything goes in a circle.

      The last straw was that the employer began to hint at the fact that I was not working well, and what was most shameful: he was right.  Having weighed everything, I realized that it was not possible to work well with my wife and child at home.  I stayed in this mode for exactly one month, and I would not wish such an experience to the enemy.  No health is enough.  As a result, I did not really pay attention to my wife or work.  There were mutual insults and quarrels.  I ended up giving projects to childless friends, finding a well-paid job in an office with a flexible, non-volatile schedule, and for the past year and a half I have not regretted it at all. <br><br>  PS: okay, let's not prevaricate ... sorry, but just a little bit. <br><br>  PPS: this is my first topic on Habr√©, do not judge very strictly. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/65801/">https://habr.com/ru/post/65801/</a></p>
