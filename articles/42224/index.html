Medvedev's speech, stating the need to build aircraft carriers. <br>  I decided to write about my service.  On these aircraft carriers. <br>  I am writing as it is.  Without exaggeration, without embellishment, without convention.  I write as I see.  I will write both good and bad.  All. <br>  You will read and answer the question of the topic.  I am also convinced that what is written here will be read by high state and military officials.  I hope they will, too. <br><br>  <u>I write as simplified as possible for understanding by a normal civilian person.</u> <br>  ============================= <br>  Autumn.  Leningrad Nakhimov Naval School.  LNVMU - in one word. <br>  Went to the sidekicks in another company.  I see a cadet returning from practice from the North.  Tells about the reception of aviation "Kiev".  Handsomely!  Spectacular!  Impressive! <br>  Even in the form of an oral story. <br><br>  Practitioner for any cadet set.  After each course.  And they studied for five years.  And we were lucky because we always went to the coolest fleet - the Northern.  The coolest squadron - the Atlantic, the 7th OPESK.

      <b>1.</b> Birthday  We go to the cinema.  " <b>The case in the square 36-80</b> ".  U-ffff!  This is the power!  This is aviation!  This ...! <br>  Later, the people who starred in the film became my superiors.  I still maintain good relations with them. <br><br>  <b>2.</b> And the officers were striking - officers of the Kiev ‚ÄúKiev‚Äù <i>(Tak - heavy aircraft carrying cruiser; approx. Avt.)</i> .  It seems that people are like people, but there was something in them that was not entirely clear, which distinguished and distinguished from all.  Here stands a group of twenty people and officers of the cruiser "Kiev" are visible in this group.  And the form on them somehow sat differently, and the look is different, and all of them are different.  From them flowed some not ordinary light.  He felt in everything.  In shape, in walking, in movements, in manners, in conversation.  In all! <br>  They are always trimmed, shaved, ironed, decorated with expensive cologne.  These were brilliant naval officers whom we used to imagine from books and films. <br>  There were carefully selected.  There, just like that, do not get.  Of the officer elite, there served the most elite. <br><br>  Suddenly they say that the shots send me to ‚ÄúKiev‚Äù.  In, lucky!  In, happiness! <br>  This, probably, and I will be so polished! <br><br>  <b>3.</b> Sevastopol.  I come to the sidekick in the coastal military unit and ask them to call a classmate at the checkpoint.  Tell me that you came ..., with ... <br>  Michman, who was on duty at the checkpoint, looks at me with an astonished look.  He is in a daze.  He is in shock.  He looks at me like a god.  He looks for a long time, then, embarrassed, asks: " <b>Is this you right in the" Kiev "who serve in the North?</b> " <br>  " <b>Well, yes</b> " - I answer: " <b>Right on it and serve</b> ." <br>  ‚Äú <b>A long time ago?</b> ‚Äù The midshipman modestly reproaches. <br>  " <b>Yes, a few years already</b> " - I answer. <br>  Michman calls by phone.  Calls up.  Transmits my request and puts the handset on the device.  And at least he did everything completely, but he breaks down and runs verbally through the territory of the unit to transfer information about my arrival verbally. <br>  <b>Nice damn it!</b> <br><br>  <b>4.</b> Georgia.  Gudauri.  Ski resort.  Do not know what the hell - 8 km track. <br>  Come to the tavern.  A rustle of tavern: " <b>Sailors came</b> ." <br>  An elderly Georgian approaches and asks: " <b>Do you guys serve in the navy?</b> " <br>  " <b>We serve</b> " - we answer modestly. <br>  ‚Äú <b>On the Black Sea, on small boats?</b> ‚Äù - specifies. <br>  ‚Äú <b>Not, in the North. And we have a small ship like this - 270 meters in length.‚Äú Kiev ‚Äùis called</b> ‚Äù - calmly replied. <br>  The Georgian choked, coughed and went. <br>  Since then, the whole tavern considered it fortunate to invite us to a table and treat us at our own expense. <br>  The Caucasus is a delicate matter.  It seems like a man should not allow himself to pay for others.  On the one hand. And on the other hand, you can offend a person by refusing. <br>  Get out.  How?  I do not remember. <br><br>  <b>5.</b> Girls. <br>  " <b>Wow! You serve on a ship! How interesting! Rockets, deck, antennas! Shape! Light carcasses at once!</b> " <br><br>  Continuation <a href="http://cayman.habrahabr.ru/blog/42237/">here</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/42224/">https://habr.com/ru/post/42224/</a></p>
