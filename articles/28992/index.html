No matter what, but except for 4 people (me and another company of guys), nobody cared about him, the tram signaled to drive, and all the rest went along with their business (to sleep). <br>  Tolstoy guys immediately began to call in an ambulance.  But they can see it for the first time, since they didn‚Äôt even know that they couldn‚Äôt call directly from their mobile phones on 01.02.03. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>  And at this very moment the victim himself (a man of 25-27 years old, only in his underwear and barefoot, half drenched in blood, and holding his chest with his hand) continued to move away towards the VDNH m along the tram routes, with persistent persistence refusing help.

      Without thinking twice, I dial 112 myself, where the operator suggests pressing 1,2,3 depending on the service and so on. In general, I call you soon, the woman writes everything from my words that the guy is naked, in blood and in alcohol intoxication goes toward the subway along the paths.  At the same time she asked me if I didn‚Äôt know where he would go in 10-15 minutes (while the ambulance would go), and at the end of the conversation I recorded my phone number. <br><br>  While I was walking home myself (since you don‚Äôt go to public transport later than 12-00 in the night) a woman calls me back (10 minutes after the application for the ambulance), and starts asking again all the same questions, supposedly from where what happened to him and how, but at the end she began to raise her voice, with complaints about, they say, why I didn‚Äôt call the police, but to the ambulance. <br>  When asked why I should call the police first, the answer dumbfounded me: ‚ÄúAnd what, my team will stop him on the tracks, the police should do it, or you yourself.‚Äù  And after this phrase, she threw the phone. <br><br>  When I got home in a ‚Äúlight‚Äù shock, after 20 minutes a woman called me back (already different, and from her mobile phone) completely calm and adequate, and asked me to tell me again where I saw who and in what condition, explaining that contacted the police, and that they, together with the ambulance brigade, began to search for the victim.  At the end of the conversation she thanked me and wished me a pleasant night. <br><br>  And now I sit and think, does a person‚Äôs life really depend on the mood of the people. <br>  After all, the one who called back and hung up the phone at the end was not very interested in what was there and how she needed to drive in, because I had disturbed them first, and not the police. <br>  But the last girl, she found out everything, contacted the Police herself, and also thanked her and wished them all the best. <br><br>  Thank you for the fact that there are still Good people for whom the Hippocratic Oath means something. <habracut></habracut></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/28992/">https://habr.com/ru/post/28992/</a></p>
