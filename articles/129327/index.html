We, too.  Maybe such a defocus is not very true, but in any case it is convenient for customers.  In addition, for IT companies, the site acts as the main carrier of corporate identity, and in the absence of work, it is necessary to begin with style. <br><br>  We do not like the phrase "corporate identity" - it does not really mean anything.  More precisely means, but all the time something is different.  Probably there is no more confusion with any term. <br><br>  We have divided this type of work into 4 areas - they are called here in a completely different way and correspond to the very specific tasks of our customers.  It seemed to us that such a classification could be useful to other companies, both developers and customers.

    <a name="habracut"></a><h5>  Office Recruitment </h5><br>  The easiest level of work is to prepare business documents: business cards, letterheads, envelopes, folders, invoices, printing, etc.  Most often, new companies are ordered in order to simply start workflow. <br><br><img src="http://out.nimax.ru/publications/f_style/nimax_publications_f_style_1.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Objectives: ensuring the daily activities of the company. <br><br>  Result of work: models of all objects. <br><br><h5>  Corporate Style Media </h5><br>  Making a number of carriers: office documents, printing, souvenirs, interior elements, cars, site.  In each project, the list changes according to the tasks of the client. <br><br>  Guidelines are often made brief and rather for internal use by the agency - the customer doesn‚Äôt really need them, because all the carriers are ready.  Such projects are easily recognizable by the huge, sometimes several pages, list of objects that need to be arranged. <br><br><img src="http://out.nimax.ru/publications/f_style/nimax_publications_f_style_2.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Tasks: visual distancing from the environment with a precisely known list of items necessary for work. <br><br>  Result of work: models of all objects. <br><br><h5>  Visual identification system </h5><br>  The system of visual identification is already beyond the design of specific objects.  Created rules, in accordance with which you can arrange anything.  Corporate identity design is developed according to these rules, modifying for each carrier.  The main result of the work is not layouts, but detailed guidelines sufficient for transmission to the customer and his contractors. <br><br><img src="http://out.nimax.ru/publications/f_style/nimax_publications_f_style_3.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Objective: the creation of corporate identity, as a system of visual distancing from the environment that can grow with the business without the participation of developers.  As a rule, such a system is necessary for a developed advertising activity involving the company's own designers and a number of external contractors working with the corporate style. <br><br>  The result of the work: a guideline on the use of corporate identity, media layouts. <br><br><h5>  Visual communication system </h5><br>  A visual communications system is an integral part of the overall business communications system.  Through corporate identity, part of a common, pre-planned interaction with target audiences begins to take place.  For such projects, a description of the company's positioning, a detailed story about the target audiences with which to interact, and the rules by which this interaction will take place are necessary. <br><br>  It sounds complicated, so I‚Äôll give an example: if we, for some unknown reason, use clip art with foreign people in our corporate style, this is just a design.  And if during the brief study we found out that contact with the company‚Äôs managers is extremely important for Central Asia, we decided that we needed to show these people, took pictures of them and asked to blog on the company‚Äôs website - this is a planned interaction, part of which is done via a visual channel. <br><br><img src="http://out.nimax.ru/publications/f_style/nimax_publications_f_style_4.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Objective: the creation of a system of visual distancing from the environment, capable of communicating informational and emotional messages. <br><br>  The result of the work: communication platform, guideline, layouts. <br><br>  We usually have the third and fourth types of work.  It turns out <a href="http://www.nimax.ru/portfolio/8.html">like this</a> . <br><br>  PS: Despite the fact that, from the point of view of identification, logo and naming are key elements, we don‚Äôt consider them in this material, as they are usually pretty straightforward. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/129327/">https://habr.com/ru/post/129327/</a></p>
