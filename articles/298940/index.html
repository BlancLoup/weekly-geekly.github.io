And this is not the worst case, because if there is a limited number of options, you can always weigh everything pretty quickly and choose the best one.  And if you can‚Äôt choose at all, you can toss a coin or dice and rely on chance. <br><br>  Worse, when instead of a fork with a road stone, a person is simply ‚Äúin the open field,‚Äù and he has no options at all in his head.  I learned "on the machine" in the tower, and then suddenly the student life was over, and you hang.  One of the reasons for such uncertainty may be the subconscious aspirations that dominate a person, which he cannot formulate in verbal form.  A person simply does not understand what he really needs in this life.

      But in fact, to navigate in this situation and identify possible ways of career development in just 10-15 minutes.  The European branding and personnel agency Universum Global has created an <a href="https://career-test.com/">original test</a> that helps to determine the professional inclinations of the individual, compare their salary expectations with their regional competitors for an armchair and get references to vacancies from your employer. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  According to Universum Global, there are 7 different career types, depending on career preferences, goals, and personality traits.  Understanding what type you are is very useful for self-identification.  <a href="https://career-test.com/">The test</a> will help determine which of the seven conditional career types you belong to and give them a characteristic. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/933/e53/878/933e538788a0581dbdbaf412af616762.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><br><br>  If you decide to enter your e-mail at the end of the test (if you are paranoid and are afraid of spam, enter not the main box, but <i>they do not send spam</i> ), you will be given access to statistical information about the salary expectations of applicants from your industry and region references to the vacancies of the most suitable employers.  Among them, there will surely be those about which you have never even heard of, but which provide good career opportunities. <br><br>  Of course, the test doesn‚Äôt do any magic, and you won‚Äôt expect miracles, but the most important thing is that while passing the test, you focus on your career ambitions, perhaps a long-forgotten dream will flash in your head.  The test gives the very guidelines, the options, seeing which, it is already easier to start moving forward, and serves as the very coin that helps to make a choice. <br><br>  By the way, many people probably know about the coin flip paradox.  " <i>When you are faced with a choice, just toss a coin. It may not give the right answer, but at the moment when the coin is in the air, you suddenly start feeding on one of the possible outcomes</i> ."  If you do not agree with the results of the test, it means that you have become clearer in presenting your perspectives. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/298940/">https://habr.com/ru/post/298940/</a></p>
