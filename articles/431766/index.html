In 1950, Dirk Brauer and Adrianus Van Voerkam suggested that the eccentricity of the Martian orbit also changes with time, leading to changes in its climate.

      However, even the first flying missions transmitted pictures of too low quality to lift the veil of secrecy on this issue.  But already <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259C%25D0%25B0%25D1%2580%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580-9">Mariner 9</a> (for the first time among Earth probes that went into the Martian orbit and worked on it from November 14, 1971 to October 27, 1972) managed to transfer more than 7 thousand decent quality images with a resolution of 100-1000 meters per pixel.  For fans of <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2590%25D1%258D%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B8%25D1%2582%25D0%25B0">"Aelita"</a> Alexei Tolstoy and <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2592%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B9%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B0_%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B8%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2">"War of the Worlds" by</a> HG Wells, the news was disappointing: the channels on Mars opened by Giovanni Schiaparelli were just an optical illusion, and Mars itself appeared to humanity as a lifeless desert.  Temperature fluctuations on the planet ranged from -143 ¬∞ C at the poles in winter to + 35 ¬∞ C on a sunny day at the equator in summer, and the atmospheric pressure over most of the planet was so low that water ice turned into vapor and back bypassing the liquid phase. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/oc/xv/dd/ocxvddlo0l7oapxixv4z7bq_wsm.jpeg"><br>  <i>The first traces of the inconstancy of the Martian climate obtained by ‚ÄúMariner-9‚Äù: the picture clearly shows the layered structure of the polar caps going from the upper right corner of the image to the center of its lower part.</i> <br><br>  However, there was some good news: the device managed to photograph more than 70% of the Martian surface, including the polar caps.  There were almost no craters on them, which indicated their young age (it was estimated at 20 million years).  Also everywhere, starting from the 80th parallel to the very poles, a layered structure was fixed - this meant that the polar caps of Mars are not only very young formations, but also periodically changed during this period.  The theory of the variability of the Martian climate began to be confirmed. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/mr/rg/ua/mrrguadldedf37ykhjaq0rcedag.png"><br><br>  The first simulations gave changes in eccentricity in the range of 0.004‚Äì0.141, which almost coincided with modern estimates of 0‚Äì0.16.  The current value of the eccentricity for Mars is estimated at 0.0934 - it is still very important compared to the Earth's 0.0167 and it is second only to Mercury.  It was precisely on the basis of the observations of Tycho Brahe of the Mars movement that Johann Kepler was able to come to the conclusion that the orbits of the planets are elliptical, rather than circular, which later allowed him to compose his three <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2597%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BA%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BD%25D1%258B_%25D0%259A%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BF%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0">famous laws</a> . <br><br>  The cyclicality of eccentricity changes was also correctly determined by two periods of 95 thousand and 2 million years (although due to difficulties in measuring the deposition rate of rocks in the polar caps of Mars, errors were estimated to be as much as <a href="http://planetary.brown.edu/pdfs/2839.pdf">two orders of</a> magnitude).  But the changes in the orbital inclination were estimated incorrectly: due to the understatement of the effect of <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259F%25D1%2580%25D0%25B5%25D1%2586%25D0%25B5%25D1%2581%25D1%2581%25D0%25B8%25D1%258F">precession</a> on this parameter, the first calculations of the researchers gave only 15-35 ¬∞ instead of modern 0-80 ¬∞. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/is/ez/w2/isezw2wamq0ubjnw5wvwqvddgry.gif"><br>  <i>Animation of the precession of the axis of rotation of the Earth.</i>  <i>Mars is going in the opposite direction.</i> <br><br>  Despite the fact that Mars weighs almost 10 times less than Earth, its cycles take much longer.  For the Earth, the precession cycle takes <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomy_on_Mars">25,800 years</a> , while for Mars it is as much as 56,600 years (the speed of the precession is <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259F%25D1%2580%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B0%25D1%2580%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B5_%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B2%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B9">50.3 angular seconds</a> for the Earth and <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Jihad_Touma/publication/6108775_The_Chaotic_Obliquity_of_Mars/links/00b7d53553beb1b85b000000.pdf">8.26 angular seconds</a> for Mars, respectively).  The cycle of change of the axis of the Earth‚Äôs tilt is 41 thousand years, and Mars has 124 thousand.  The precession of the axis of rotation of the planet leads to interesting effects: the gradual change of the axis of rotation of the planet associated with it leads to the fact that the title of the "polar" star eventually moves from one of them to another.  At the same time, it gradually ‚Äúdrifts‚Äù and the beginning of the seasons: on Earth, they shift backward by 1 day every 70.5 years, and on Mars, on the contrary, they shift 1 day forward every 83.3 years.  The rate of change in this case almost coincides with the fact that the Martian year itself is 1.8 times longer than the earthly one. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b2c/fe5/199/b2cfe5199a4d4801b1696242b48e3603.gif" alt="image"><br>  <i>Evolution of the south polar cap according to the images <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mars_Global_Surveyor">of Mars Global Surveyor</a> .</i> <br><br>  Due to the high eccentricity of the Martian orbit, which coincides in <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2590%25D1%2584%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B9">aphelia</a> (the most distant point of the orbit from the Sun) with winter in the southern hemisphere, the climate in this hemisphere is more severe, and the southern polar cap is much larger than the northern one in size.  Among other interesting features: the duration of the day on Mars is 37.4 minutes longer than Earth‚Äôs, but further the separation will decrease, as the rotation of Mars slows down at a speed of 3 orders of magnitude less than that of the Earth, which is associated with a small mass of two Mars satellites compared to our moon. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/5l/3d/dq/5l3ddqt2t6vemgdivzwa8zpacay.png"><br>  <i>1001 <a href="https://spacescience.arc.nasa.gov/mars-climate-workshop-2012/documents/extendedabstracts/Laskar.pdf">simulation of the</a> change of the axis of rotation of Mars.</i> <br><br>  In <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/338237a0">1989,</a> Lascar established that the parameters <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259F%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B5%25D1%2582%25D1%258B_%25D0%25B7%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BC%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B9_%25D0%25B3%25D1%2580%25D1%2583%25D0%25BF%25D0%25BF%25D1%258B">of the terrestrial planets</a> change chaotically (mainly due to the influence of the also randomly moving asteroids West and Ceres, which are influenced by the objects of the Asteroid Belt).  This leads to the fact that it is impossible to accurately determine changes in the slope of the axis and the eccentricity of Mars for a period of more than 10 million years (this period is called <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2592%25D1%2580%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BC%25D1%258F_%25D0%259B%25D1%258F%25D0%25BF%25D1%2583%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B0">Lyapunov time</a> ), and for a period of more than 50 million years it becomes impossible to determine even the statistical distribution of their values ‚Äã‚Äã( for the Earth, these intervals are 50 and 250 million years, respectively).  But for periods within 10 million years, the characteristics of the orbits of all the planets of the solar system can be determined with sufficiently high accuracy. <br><br>  Studies of these indicators for other planets also yielded <a href="http://adsbit.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-iarticle_query%3F1994A%2526A...287L...9L%26defaultprint%3DYES%26filetype%3D.pdf">very interesting</a> results: with the fact that the parameters of the orbits of the giant planets do not practically change, Mars and Mercury have their eccentricities fluctuated over very wide limits.  And for Mercury, they were so great at all that they could at intervals of billions of years lead to the fact that it could be thrown out of the solar system as it approached Venus (this probability was in the past and persists in the future).  It can also allow us to take a different look at <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259F%25D0%25B0%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B4%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BA%25D1%2581_%25D0%25A4%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B8">the Fermi paradox</a> (the problem of why we do not find traces of life in other stars), since for the emergence of life on the planet it turns out that it not only needs to form in the <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2597%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B0_%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B1%25D0%25B8%25D1%2582%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BC%25D0%25BE%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D0%25B8">habitable zone</a> with its star, but still be in quasistable state with other planets, so as not to fall out of it. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/h1/z2/ni/h1z2nihvbl12l5rddg183plrnny.png"><br><br>  But back to Mars.  According to estimates, the original atmosphere of Mars had a pressure of 6 times the current Earth, but as a result of the <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259F%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B7%25D0%25B4%25D0%25BD%25D1%258F%25D1%258F_%25D1%2582%25D1%258F%25D0%25B6%25D1%2591%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B0%25D1%258F_%25D0%25B1%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B1%25D0%25B0%25D1%2580%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B8%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B0">late heavy bombardment with</a> asteroids and comets (which happened 3.8 billion years ago), Mars lost most of it retaining a pressure of <a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1029/1999JE001048">0.5-1</a> Earth's atmosphere (500- 1000 <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2591%25D0%25B0%25D1%2580_(%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D1%2586%25D0%25B0_%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B7%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D1%258F)">mbar</a> ).  But now we are seeing an average pressure at the Martian surface of only 6 mbar - where did the rest go?  Until recently, the main reason for the loss of the Martian atmosphere was the disappearance of the magnetic field, which ceased to prevent the atmosphere from "blowing off" under the influence of the solar wind. <br><br>  But as shown by further studies, the absence of a magnetic field, on the contrary, <a href="https://habr.com/post/384695/">slows</a> down its rate of volatilization: the atmospheric loss measured by the MAVEN satellite in the first 2 years of its operation averaged <a href="https://hal-insu.archives-ouvertes.fr/insu-01599004/document">2,193 tons</a> per year.  Even if we take into account that these measurements were made on the decline of solar activity, and the average value will be several times higher, this is still not enough: the previous estimates of scientists, based on a loss rate of 568 tons per year in the solar minimum in modern times, gave a total loss of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere in the amount of <a href="https%253A%252F%252Fwww.researchgate.net%252Fprofile%252FRickard_Lundin%252Fpublication%252F6547754_Martian_Atmospheric_Erosion_Rates%252Flinks%252F02bfe5107d7ba26934000000.pdf%26cc_key%3D">0.8-43 mbar</a> over the previous 3.5 billion years.  That is, extrapolating their estimates for the MAVEN data obtained (which turned out to be 3.86 times higher), we get a leak at 31-166 mbar during this period, against a minimum of 500 mbar. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/4w/uu/wa/4wuuwa5zpqscgazaexmmoa0jk4a.jpeg"><br>  <i>The change in atmospheric pressure for the Martian year.</i>  <i>The difference in testimony is due to the fact that Viking-2 was located 900 meters below the average level of the Martian surface than its fellow Viking-1.</i> <br><br>  What other suspects are there?  The Viking landing platforms found that the Martian soil contains a significant proportion of <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259C%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BD%25D1%2582%25D0%25BC%25D0%25BE%25D1%2580%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BB%25D0%25BB%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D1%2582">montmorillonite</a> clays, which can adsorb a significant mass of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.  So besides <a href="https://repository.si.edu/bitstream/handle/10088/16762/201163.pdf">4-5 mbar</a> wandering from pole to pole in polar caps (according to newer data there can be <a href="https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1186/BF03351682.pdf">up to 85 mbar</a> ) and 6 mbar in the atmosphere, it is assumed that about <a href="https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19940017198.pdf">300 mbar of</a> carbon dioxide from the atmosphere was absorbed by the soil and another 130 mbar turned into carbonates in it.  Estimates of the total current carbon dioxide reserves on Mars by various scientists vary within fairly wide limits: <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0019103505003209">from ‚â§200 to ‚â•450 mbar</a> .  But before that, they altogether fluctuated in the range of <a href="http://lunar.earth.northwestern.edu/courses/438/mckay1991.pdf">200-10000 mbar</a> . <br><br>  The reason for this spread was our poor knowledge of the internal structure of the ‚ÄúRed Planet‚Äù.  Even now, even though we have not bad studied the polar caps of Mars, as well as the near-surface layers of Mars throughout its area to a depth of a couple of meters, our knowledge of its internal structure leaves much to be desired, which is why the spread of estimates is still large.  Opening the curtain on this issue should be the landing platform <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/InSight">¬´InSight¬ª</a> , which landed on Mars on November 26.  Onboard the InSight are a sensitive seismometer and a 5-meter folding drill (chemical analysis of the soil is not collected in this case, but measuring the physical properties of the soil at such depths will be a big step for us). <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/t6/nz/xo/t6nzxouzgjv2is8wnxxsfj8kqpe.png"></a> <br><br>  ‚ÄúHow does all this affect the Martian climate?‚Äù - you can ask.  The point here is that the eccentricity determines how closely the planet approaches the Sun and how much time per revolution it spends in this position.  Thus, eccentricity affects the climate of the planet as a whole, and the tilt of the axis affects its latitudinal distribution: when the rotational axis of the planet reaches the slope, the values ‚Äã‚Äãof the planet <a href="https://atmos.washington.edu/~davidc/papers_mine/Catling-MarsAtmos-inpress2006.pdf">‚Äôs 54 ¬∞</a> pole begin to receive the same amount of sunlight as the equator.  And with a further increase in slope - even more than him.  Thus, the climate at the poles becomes warmer than at the equator, which in turn leads to the melting of the upper layer of polar caps consisting of <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A1%25D1%2583%25D1%2585%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B9_%25D0%25BB%25D1%2591%25D0%25B4">‚Äúdry ice‚Äù</a> (frozen carbon dioxide).  And since carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas, its release causes warming throughout the planet as a whole. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/c6/jr/sy/c6jrsyvpjy_srrwuvvgzuvjw9n4.jpeg"><br>  <i>The graph of annual peaks of temperatures in the regions of the polar caps according to a 2012 <a href="">study</a> .</i>  <i>The highest temperatures are highlighted in black, and the middle temperatures are red and yellow, and low temperatures are white (with the diamond showing the current state of Mars).</i>  <i>The blue rectangle indicates the interval for changing the parameters of eccentricity and inclination near the Earth.</i> <br><br>  Over the entire set of factors, the optimal parameters for heating Mars are the average eccentricity (0.06-0.08) and the coincidence of the orbit perihelion with the day of the equinox (0 ¬∞ or 360 ¬∞), but in general these parameters have a much smaller influence on the climate.  The current values ‚Äã‚Äãfor Mars are 25.19 ¬∞ axis tilt, eccentricity of 0.0934 and perihelion 286.502 ¬∞.  The eccentricity of the orbit of Mars is now moving to its peak at 0.105 (which should reach 24 thousand years later), after which it will move back to the indicator of 0.002 (which will reach 100 thousand years later).  Unfortunately, the slope of Mars is now in its quiet phase, near a cycle minimum of 2 million years, and does not plan to rise above 36 ¬∞ in the near future.  So Mars in the foreseeable future for us must remain a vast desert. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/59/d5/02/59d50247f28a9678377333.gif"><br>  <i>Sandy whirlwind filmed by the Spirit rover on May 15, 2005.</i>  <i>Gif displays the process of movement of the vortex in 9.5 minutes (the interval between frames is about half a minute).</i> <br><br>  However, this does not mean that the climate of Mars will not change in the near future.  More precisely, it is changing right now: for the period from receiving the latest information from <a href="https://habr.com/post/407901/">the Vikings</a> in 1977 and until receiving the first data from <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mars_Global_Surveyor">the Mars Global Surveyor</a> probe in 1999, the temperature of the Martian surface rose <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature05718">to 0.86 ¬∞ C.</a>  This process is not directly related to the phenomena described above - scientists have found an explanation for him in the change in the <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2590%25D0%25BB%25D1%258C%25D0%25B1%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B4%25D0%25BE">albedo of</a> Mars (the degree of reflectivity of its surface) which, as it turned out, has changed by more than 10% in these 22 years by one third of the Martian surface. <br><br>  This change does not portend so far to make the terraforming of Mars much easier, because according to preliminary estimates by scientists, it is required to raise the surface temperature by as much as <a href="https://ucarecdn.com/49fee49b-7688-4878-9cdf-513a33d9f104/mckay1991.pdf">25 ¬∞ C</a> - otherwise, after removing the external influence, Mars will return to its original cold state.  The change of Mars albedo itself seems to be associated with dust storms, and as seen in the photographs, the south polar cap ( <a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2004JE002345">formed</a> during the period of the year when a global dust storm occurs on Mars) becomes dirtier than the north one. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/fv/p5/iw/fvp5iwe1syo2e0iu0gkypye1m48.jpeg"><br><br>  Now these data are based on only two time points and it is too early to talk about any patterns.  However, studies of eccentricity and tilt cycles also suggest that global warming is occurring on Mars right now, but at a much lower rate: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/_r/hf/xa/_rhfxawpelahbwwsa2k4x-pjkmu.png"><br>  <i>The blue line is the temperature at which the permafrost begins to melt in the Gale crater, located 5 ¬∞ south of the equator (obtained from <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259C%25D0%25B0%25D1%2580%25D1%2581%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BD%25D1%2581%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B0%25D1%258F_%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B0%25D1%2583%25D1%2587%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B0%25D1%258F_%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B1%25D0%25BE%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0%25D1%2582%25D0%25BE%25D1%2580%25D0%25B8%25D1%258F">Curiosity</a> ).</i> <br><br>  What can give us this small peak on the graph, to which we are now moving?  Generally speaking, quite a bit.  With an increase in the average temperature on Mars, global warming should also occur there, as on Earth: with an atmospheric pressure of 6.1 mbar and a temperature of 158 ¬∞ K in Martian soil it can adsorb up to 11 cm¬≥ of carbon dioxide per gram of soil, but at a temperature at 196 ¬∞ K, saturation occurs already at 3.5 cm¬≥ per gram.  Thus, the heating of the soil will cause the release of the greenhouse gas accumulated in it.  However, in general, from this small increase in the average temperature, the effect itself will be insignificant.  Moreover, due to the limited thermal conductivity of the soil, it does not warm up immediately, but at a speed of about 1 meter per year, so these narrow peaks do not have time to warm up Mars to a considerable depth and cause the release of significant volumes of carbon dioxide. <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/dm/d5/39/dmd539zwxsimd9hdbaqidsu6xfs.jpeg"></a> <br>  <i>A suspension of dust in the Martian atmosphere makes his sky opposite to the earth.</i> <br><br>  In addition to the release of gases from the ground, one more effect that increases warming is possible: with a significant increase in atmospheric pressure, the famous global dust storms of Mars, <a href="http://www.mars.asu.edu/christensen/classdocs/Toon_ClimaticChangeMars_icarus_80.pdf">according to scientists,</a> should come to naught.  It should also raise the average temperature on the planet, since these storms can cover the entire planet for a period of several Earth months to half a year, reflecting part of the world back into space.  But perhaps even more important consequence of this is that according to another <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0012821X18305065">recent study,</a> these storms are a source of perchlorates on Mars, which in large concentrations are poisonous to humans and most life forms on Earth (including plants).  Thus, the climate warming on the ‚ÄúRed Planet‚Äù can directly serve to increase the fertility of its soil.  However, this effect requires much more warming than will be achieved in the current temperature increase cycle, so this is more likely to be discussed in the context of the terraforming of Mars, which will be discussed in the next article. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ii/nx/v6/iinxv6zjmblfjpj_e_sp2smpgxk.jpeg"><br><br>  <i>At the end of the article, I would like to invite everyone interested in research, colonization and terraforming of Mars to subscribe to the group of the Martian society on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/marssocietyrussia/">Facebook</a> and <a href="https://vk.com/themarssociety">VKontakte</a> , and also <a href="http://www.marssociety.org/home/join_us/">join</a> our ranks or become the coordinators of the Martian society in the regions in order to make their own contribution to the transformation of "In blue-green.</i>  <i>To do this, you can contact <a href="https://vk.com/perasperaadmars">me</a> or <a href="https://vk.com/id28811828">Alex</a> .</i> <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Climate infographic in Gale crater</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/gp/l1/kw/gpl1kw3fkncmutakm7rg071qd5q.jpeg"></div></div><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">References to the used literature</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  <a href="http://planetary.brown.edu/pdfs/2839.pdf">Orbital forcing of the martian polar layered deposits.</a> <br><br>  <a href="http://science.sciencemag.org/content/180/4086/638">Periodic insolation variations on Mars.</a> <br><br>  <a href="https://doi.org/10.1029/JC079i024p03375">Climatic variations on Mars: 1.
