  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Revival of the legend: we put the OS on Libretto 50 CT</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Inspired by the articles of my friend <a href="http://geektimes.ru/users/kurtkrut/" class="user_link">kurtkrut</a> about how laptops were made in the 90s, I remembered that there was just the same machine in the country, I immediately thought to revive it and even start using it.  This Toshiba Libretto 50 CT came to me a long time ago from my friend, I used it mainly for writing reports at school and programming in Turbo Pascal.  After I lost the power supply, the laptop was abandoned with a dead battery to hell. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/621/e90/813/621e90813765af3b774aa39ff885f99c.jpg" alt="image"><br>  So, I found my Libretto and decided to revive it using Linux! <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h1>  Introduction </h1><br>  So in order to start this unit it was necessary to find a power supply and take into account all the limitations of equipment and hardware available, and they are not small.  Firstly, I only had PCMCIA Floppy from the manufacturer, and there was no CD-ROM or ZIP, as well as the ability to get them.  Secondly, the HDD in the laptop is 810MB, which does not allow writing a full-fledged image of a Linux distribution to it.  I found <a href="http://geektimes.ru/users/kurtkrut/" class="user_link">out</a> what kind of power supply I needed from <a href="http://geektimes.ru/users/kurtkrut/" class="user_link">kurtkrut</a> and went for the 15B unit to the store.  Already in the store took what was on the 15V, which was the first step. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/a29/258/845/a292588452e7285ce3d6a477ac21b559.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Next, I studied the distributions and the possibility of installing them on weak computers.  It was decided to try 3 distributions: <br><ul><li>  DSL </li><li>  Black cat linux </li><li>  Deli linux </li></ul>

    <h1>  Attempt number 1 </h1><br>  To install DSL, I needed to download the latest installation disk and prepare a set of boot floppies.  The hard drive was removed from the laptop to write an installation disk to it.  An external controller was used for operation. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/523/e6f/98e/523e6f98e262a6f61472410ecf8ab44c.jpg" alt="image"><br>  Screw had to be divided immediately into three sections: <br><ul><li>  Section with DSL installation on 120 MB in FAT16 </li><li>  32MB swap swap partition </li><li>  Section to use </li></ul><br>  Burning the image to the newly broken disk was successful right away, it was also easy to create floppy disks and boot disks (there are three of them in theory) <br>  Replacing the screw in place, I started the process: after checking the memory, the laptop gave me a GRUB prompt with installation options where I entered due to the dsl options fromhd = / dev / hda mem = 16M.  The kernel was loaded for several minutes and required a root floppy disk, but the floppy was somehow strangely buzzing, after examining the log, it became clear that Toshiba‚Äôs regular floppy was undecided ... I couldn‚Äôt do anything about it. <br><h3>  Conclusion </h3><br>  DSL in such a way could not be put on it due to the lack of support for the floppy disk drive. <br><br><h1>  Attempt number 2 </h1><br>  Pulling out the screw, I decided to install Deli Linux in the same way, but tormsbt linux was used to boot from floppy.  Recorded the necessary data on the screw, created a floppy disk.  I load and see absolutely the same picture as in the first case. <br><h3>  Conclusion </h3><br>  It became clear that all the floppy distributions are based on the same package and they do not support Toshiba floppies.  It's a pity‚Ä¶ <br><br><h1>  Attempt number 3 </h1><br>  After reading all that I found on this topic on the net, I liked the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãinstalling from a virtual machine.  I once saw the opportunity to connect a physical screw to a virtual machine and this virtual machine was VMware, having created a new guest system in it, I was disappointed that it only hooks the physical screw as a SCSI device.  So, I created a virtual screw like IDE and put Deli on it.  The next step was to boot from the Ubuntu LiveCD in a virtual machine and hooked virtual and physical hard drives.  With the dd utility, I copied everything from one to another. <br><br>  #dd if = / dev / hda of = / dev / sda <br><br>  So I got a HDD with an installed system and a slightly wrong partition table.  Using the fdlisk utility, after adjusting the partition table, I returned the disk to my laptop‚Äôs native connector. <br>  It is not possible to imagine my delight when I saw the LILO loader and the choice of Deli.  Clicking on a system point, I was again disappointed: the kernel booted and reached init, but after the current, as it began to check with the fsck.ext2 partitions, I saw a core dump ... my breakdown had no limits ... <br><h3>  Conclusion </h3><br>  In this way, I tried to install all three systems proposed above, but the result was only one with different addresses in the core dump. <br><br><h1>  Conclusion </h1><br>  So, I concluded that it is impossible to put Linux on this machine without additional processing and acceleration, everything was checked on the same Libretto 50CT for <a href="http://geektimes.ru/users/kurtkrut/" class="user_link">kurtkrut</a> and the result was the same. <br>  All three approaches made it possible to study how to install systems without a network and a CDROM, with only floppy in hand.  If the kernel booted up normally, then I would be happier, but the main thing is experience! <br><br><h1>  PS </h1><br>  The first pancake is lumpy, but I did not stop and make it work under DOS and WIN95;) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/46025/">https://habr.com/ru/post/46025/</a></p>
