      About this kind: <blockquote>  check with the evening crushing us of people‚Äôs travels, the hobby demanding my years was tearing up the bones of everything Mozhenskys imenitatsyy tossed between karmy and soviet father, he wasn‚Äôt revived, they‚Äôll be his person who punched him I know I‚Äôm not married to wedding marriage archives whoever prevailed and revenge his hands on them for half an hour on the night before the rest the other feathers would see the thousand fairy for her fool for the tedious day of the day papazazatyanul  emne from idela professet and mock gorkulto captive tera </blockquote><br><br>  For my taste, it is much more fun. <br><br>  The idea is quite simple - it is to generate the text by letter, taking into account their compatibility in the Russian language. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h4>  Materiel </h4><br>  The text is modeled as a <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A6%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BF%25D0%25B8_%25D0%259C%25D0%25B0%25D1%2580%25D0%25BA%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B0">Markov chain of the</a> Nth order, where individual letters appear as elements of the chain (outcomes of events).  The current state of the stream is determined by the N letters already typed, and the next letter is determined by the transition matrix. <br><br>  The transition matrix for each chain of N letters determines <br>  which letters are allowed for the continuation of the text and the probability of their appearance. <br>  In practice, it is a frequency dictionary of letter combinations: <br>  dict [prefix] [letter] = probability / frequency of this letter after this prefix. <br><br><h4>  Compiling a dictionary </h4><br>  To compile a dictionary, you need to scan a sufficiently large amount of text <br>  and count the number of occurrences of all possible letter combinations, and then normalize all values ‚Äã‚Äãunder each prefix. <br>  In the dictionary, you can include prefixes of fixed length, or all from 0 to the maximum. <br>  The only benefit for generating text is that using one dictionary, you can generate texts of varying degrees of readability.  And also put words in a word matrix shorter than the depth of the dictionary. <br><br>  Two options are possible: scan in a continuous stream (by text) or by words (for example, according to a dictionary). <br>  With <b>continuous scanning</b> , word delimiters (spaces, and even punctuation marks) are included in the prefix, and this makes it possible to take into account the compatibility of words to some extent (combinations like ‚Äúsame,‚Äù ‚Äúsame,‚Äù ‚Äúwhat,‚Äù etc). <br>  To scan the stream, you must save N previous letters (tail), enter each new letter in the dictionary [tail] [letter], then add it to the tail, which is truncated along the length. <br> <code>"... ...":&lt;br/&gt; <br> [...][] [...][], [..][], [.][], [][_], [_][], [_][], [_][], [_][], [][], ... <br></code> <br>  If the dictionary is not fixed depth, then in the matrix, you can enter the prefixes from the maximum to 0. (The transition matrix from the empty prefix determines the unconditional probability of a letter.) <br> <code>[][], [][], [][], [][], [][]</code> <br> <br>  When <b>scanning by words</b> , word delimiters are included in the prefix only as the first character. <br>  To add a word, you need to enter into the dictionary all the substrings are N-1 + long, adding separators to the beginning and end of the word.  With a fixed dictionary depth, shorter than N words in the dictionary will fail. <br> <code>"", "":&lt;br/&gt; <br> [_][], [][_],&lt;br/&gt; <br> [_][], [][], [][], [][], [][_]... <br></code> <br>  With such a scan, the maximum prefix length can be limited to a long word. <br><br><h4>  Text generation </h4><br>  You can also generate text in a continuous stream or by words. <br><ol><li>  An arbitrary prefix from the dictionary is selected as the starting line, <br>  beginner with a space (so as not to begin the text with letters not found at the beginning of a word) </li><li>  and until you get bored: <ol><li>  take the tail of the already typed text long N </li><li>  all possible continuations are searched in the dictionary </li><li>  the continuation is selected in a randomly weighted way and added to the text </li><li>  if the text is generated by words, and the last letter added is a separator, then you need to re-select the starting line. </li></ol></li></ol><br>  According to a dictionary compiled according to words, it can also be generated only by words, because after adding a separator to the text and tail, the entry in the dictionary will not be found, since the separator is not included in the prefix. <br>  <i>/ * "Randomly weighted" I called the method of selecting an element from an uneven distribution.</i>  <i>It is implemented by dividing a single segment into segments, proportional to the probabilities of each element, and choosing a point on this segment using a uniformly random value.</i>  <i>* /</i> <br><br>  The deeper the dictionary is used, the more readable is the generated text, but the more meaningful the words will appear in it. <br>  The average word length is in Russian = 5.28, with the depth of the dictionary&gt; = 5 most of the words are meaningful. <br>  A good ratio of readability and meaninglessness is obtained when using combinations of 3-4 (~ syllable length). <br><br><h4>  Examples </h4><br>  As a fairly representative basis, I used the <a href="http://www.artint.ru/projects/frqlist.asp">frequency dictionary of S.A. Sharov</a> <br>  It contains ~ 70000 words (word forms) occurring more often than 1 time per million, <br>  and built on the "national case of the Russian language", rather carefully compiled by scientists. <br>  Of course, it is only suitable for generating text by words. <br><br>  The full dictionary of letter combinations from 1 to the longest word (24 letters) is 820105 entries. <br>  The dictionary of combinations from 1 to 5: 240784 records. <br><br>  N = 1 <br><blockquote>  bycicles a la u lushi yla skla skhtru for skilebrut no and notusno boislchekayavskoy these not vilisenashen stalkmyruh szhavh tustoedlo chil pkost ptoch chalsr i amoblu ras eto koglu sneznotm kanazakogotrakopirovki obes  oteznopl bsnaprobe of Chez ntolily in natalst ki th d Zuren vabatayavetutoda </blockquote><br>  N = 2 <br><blockquote>  That is why they saved it for me, but I didn‚Äôt bake half the time for it, not for oh, orio on a special occasion, for which I burned the pedels because of the fact that it wasn‚Äôt bad for you, but obliquity and obscenity, I cursed a lot of the room, we used a pattern. double genocupalization of the plains by simonovaya I am not one of the otated years of this etninovori hoi onresting durii by the bed of stratepei not broken koles by the hall of them and caravnulan we think the same ska got into il otsuyu  is worried in love </blockquote><br>  N = 3 <br><blockquote>  and this sistil shook or hasn‚Äôt gotten all over the nickname of the faithful person he didn‚Äôt pick up the closest ones and he loves where you didn‚Äôt call a hoax so much that you‚Äôve gotten the aggressor In obrazu barratsii at that time for proit u in closed the first refusal from the department echel ud would have reduced uzhdun pushi same folded like a rotor just obezhomu just for what ekspekt organgetto podprovy not and if  bu difficult mouth called eslatsya </blockquote><br>  N = 4 <br><blockquote>  The traveler's boxing coat Sostok suddenly noticed that the nature doesn‚Äôt so much as asking for it, tilting the evening by traveling the most populous in the changes in the posts as a wonderful lift up the door of the cartel go to his kitchen room the habit of everything else in the evening with a drink at night probably it stops me I thought and thought it was interesting only mine in the door are in the circle I am very lads and the manual here it is in that counting from sitting cured on paper you and paper and that you agreed the main thing most friends would fail in assuring  avatel turned on sitting and breathing right hand fights </blockquote><br>  N = 5 <br><blockquote>  It was perfect for her to run down before the war before order in a huge day head only from the goats of the publishers of time.
