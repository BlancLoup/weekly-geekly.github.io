  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Are you still using Google Reader?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  When in March of this year it became known about the closure of Google Reader, I think many rushed to study similar third-party services.  And I was no exception.  Having stumbled into various services, I never found what I personally would have liked and continued to use Google Reader safely.  But time X inevitably approaches and less than two months have left before the service closes, so I again decided to look for an alternative.  This time I decided to try various opensource solutions and raise the rss reader on my server for myself and my friends.  Having studied this question, I came across ‚ÄúTiny Tiny RSS‚Äù, which, by the way, was also appreciated <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/172967/">in Habr√©</a> . <br><br>  I liked him so much that I completely stopped logging into Google Reader.  And the thought occurred to me, why not open the registration for everyone? <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  So, meet <a href="http://tinyrss.ru/">tinyrss.ru</a> 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>

      In Tiny Tiny RSS, you can import OPML (this is done in the Actions menu -&gt; Settings -&gt; Channels -&gt; OPML).  My more than a hundred feeds were imported without problems.  There are also hotkeys, the same as Google Reader and the visual interface is very similar.  There is an <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details%3Fid%3Dorg.fox.ttrss%26hl%3Dru">Android client</a> and an <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tiny-tiny-rss-notifier/pehjgkflglcdbmhkjjpfjomemgaaljeb/related">extension for Chrome</a> .  It looks like this: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/69c/5b6/3cb/69c5b63cbae960269a94fa4132a6dcdf.png"><br><br>  After voicing ideas to my friends, I heard three questions that habrayuders are likely to ask.  Immediately answer them: <br><br>  <b>Where is the service located?</b> <br>  The service is hosted on a dedicated server leased in Hetzner.  On the same server I keep some of my projects at work.  Server Specifications Intel Core i7 X980, 24 GB RAM, 2x300 GB SAS (RAID 1). <br><br>  <b>You are not afraid of a habraeffekt?</b> <br>  Well, firstly, I do not think that the topic will cause a big stir.  Secondly, I wrote above the characteristics of the server and in my opinion they are sufficient to draw out the habraeffect.  In any case, it is interesting to see how the server behaves under load :) <br><br>  <b>Where is the guarantee that the service will not close in a month?</b> <br>  You are right, there is no guarantee.  But I myself plan to actively use this service, and given that I have been using Google Reader for 5 years, I plan to use tinyrss.ru at least as much as I don‚Äôt see for myself a more convenient tool. <br><br>  But of course it is up to you to decide whether to use this service or not.  So, I repeat the address <a href="http://tinyrss.ru/">tinyrss.ru</a> <br><br>  <b>UPD.</b>  Some statistics.  Almost three thousand people have already registered in three hours!  Now the flow has subsided, but several people per minute continue to register.  Visited the site more than 4 thousand people. <br><br>  <b>UPD2.</b>  In connection with the habroeffect, not everyone has received letters with passwords.  You can re-request a password on the site via the link " <a href="http://tinyrss.ru/public.php%3Fop%3Dforgotpass">Recover password</a> ". <br><br>  <b>UPD3.</b>  The influx of volunteers turned out to be so large (as of May 11, more than 2,000 users were registered and more than 300 simultaneous connections to the service were recorded) that almost the whole of yesterday (May 10) it was impossible to get to the service.  After some optimization of the database server, the situation has been stabilized and the service is now working tolerably.  But, the option of transferring the service to a separate, more powerful server is being considered. <br><br>  <b>UPD4 from May 20th.</b>  Transferred to a separate server.  Long fumbled with optimization.  As a result, instead of apache, I now have nginx + php-fpm there.  The database has been optimized for several days and delivered to the ssd disk.  As a result, now everything works quickly. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/179091/">https://habr.com/ru/post/179091/</a></p>
