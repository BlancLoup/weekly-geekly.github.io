We are a modern IT company.  We are engaged in both the development of innovative projects and investment.  Topics of interest to us: e-commerce, payment systems, social networks and e-government.  One of the strategic directions of our development is associated with the BlackBerry brand. <br><br>  We are one of the first companies in Russia that began to cooperate with the vendor of these smartphones - the Canadian company Research In Motion (RIM).  We want to tell about our cooperation. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b>How it all began ...</b>

      In 2010, when developing the payment system for Alliance Bank, we decided to support the Apple iPhone mobile platform.  In the process of work, the theme of mobile applications presented to us a very interesting and promising.  As a result of market research, it was decided to focus on BlackBerry devices, as this is a new, interesting for us, as a developer, direction. <br><br>  Then we began to learn about the features of developing applications for BlackBerry devices, our specialists completed internships in the London branch of Research In Motion, and began to develop their applications for distribution through the BlackBerry AppWorld. <br>  We see the development of our cooperation in application development - games, image applications for music brands, clients of e-government platforms, as well as mobile applications for payment systems. <br><br><img src="http://pics.kz/s6/f4/e0/68/f4e0685f56f687c9229a3597687ba3ba.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  It's no secret that applications for Blackberry are currently significantly smaller than applications for iPhone and Android.  As for the PlayBook, there are still very few applications for it, so this direction is particularly interesting and promising for us.  This is not surprising - after all, this device was held in the hands of units, but work on applications for it is already underway! <br><br>  In the process of working with the PlayBook, we have to overcome problems known to any developer of a new platform: from insufficient information on API and unclear plans for the development of this interface to insufficient documentation on assembling an already signed project or lack of information on removing applications from the PlayBook.  We found the answers to all these questions, walked around if not all, then almost all the pitfalls, and we can share the acquired knowledge with the community. <br><br>  And now, attention!  What would you be the most interesting to read about in the next post?  We have a few Blackberry themes for you to choose from.  We can prepare a report on the trip of our employees to the training on the development of applications for BlackBerry OS 6 in England, that they learned what was interesting and useful there;  we can write about the features of the development of applications for the PlayBook;  We can talk about the subtleties of publishing applications in AppWorld.  In short, anything you choose :) <br>  Choose the most interesting topic of our next post! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/118209/">https://habr.com/ru/post/118209/</a></p>
