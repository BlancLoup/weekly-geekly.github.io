This text is a free answer to one of the commentators of the author. <br>  Attention!  There is obscene language. <br><br>  <strong>Anxiety as an exact science.</strong> <br><br>  First a bit of theory.  Immediately decide for yourself - do you think that you know exactly how the world functions, in one of the back streets of which you have lived comfortably for some ridiculous time.  If you think that yes (or you suspect that ‚Äúwell, at least a little bit I know‚Äù), you don‚Äôt need to read further - go watch TV or make ‚ÄúEuropean-quality repair‚Äù.  If you are not an asshole, then read;  what is written below will help you to smoke the sky even when three quarters of the assholes living next to you will glue the flippers together.  Why did they suddenly lift their hooves?  Because the strong assholes living in the neighborhood strongly want this and have been working on this topic for a long time and are working competently;  and more, read here carefully: and they invested in this noble enterprise ENOUGH enough funds, including ours.  Again I ask - why the scoop grunted, himself or not himself?  If your answer is yourself, then you are an asshole and your fate is to die in the near-medium term, so do not bother yourself with this paranoia, but really improve the living conditions of your family.  Direct to you in M ‚Äã‚Äãvideo, take a large plasma there on credit.

    <a name="habracut"></a><br>  Why am I about the scoop.  I'm not trying to say that a scoop is bad or good, on the drum, to be honest.  Another thing is important, the main thing: the scoop guaranteed the continuity of the supply of heat and light, and successfully extinguished everyone trying to limit their own and others.  It was stitched from him in the BIOS, he could not otherwise.  Now there is no scoop, and the force that devours his corpse is not interested in you, moreover - it wants you to die.  And you - an asshole, if you do not understand it until now;  so do me a favor - be offended by this rudeness and do not read further - grovel before the animals, who agree with the plan of their own slaughter, I do not feel like it. <br><br>  Further.  The corpse of the scoop is not against your killing, and even if he were against it, it would not change anything.  Here is the built-in test again.  A state with an atomic bomb is like a person with a shotgun - it can blow a doublet, there will be no remains.  But this is a man.  The corpse is not something to zhahnut, and even mu can not say, but the assholes constantly see one thing, they don‚Äôt want to see much at once - it is unnerving and makes it difficult to anticipate future pleasures.  They shout - nonsense, a shotgun on the spot!  Well, they don‚Äôt clean it but it‚Äôs worthless, it‚Äôs a garbage, the main thing is that it is still there.  When it will be necessary, we will charge and how we will give from both trunks ... Not even funny.  Our shotgun is attached to the decayed corpse, in which we are still fumbling.  Yes, it stinks no longer how ten or fifteen years ago, dried up on top, glass slush.  In places where it blows, it does not stink at all.  In some places you can even live, but there is one unpleasant moment: a killer with a hook is lying next to you in a chaise longue and waiting.  While the carrion does not dry up to a clean-fit state, he does not want to touch it - you will break the crust, it will still fall apart, and the place will be nepadetsky mysterious. <br><br>  He does not need this, he wants a clean place where you can safely drive into the pit of specially trained maggots, so that they get him all sorts of oil and gases.  From the fact that the pit has already been dug, but some unnecessary, to anyone, not even to themselves unnecessary opagus, devour its oil (and this, frankly, its oil), it has less and less patience.  It seems everything is clear - what is the fate awaiting an individual maggot, not trained in the extraction of oil from holes in the ground.  No, it‚Äôs unclear to the assholes, ‚ÄúEverything is somehow formed,‚Äù some are even sure that they will carry it through here.  Well, to hell with them, there they are and the road.  You are not an asshole, you still have to live - unless, of course, there are reasons. <br><br>  Most likely, the PPC, as it is usual for him, will sneak up unnoticed and you will not be ready for it, despite the rather long and unambiguous preparatory period.  The most important signal will be in a year or six months, when the killer begins to sharply scare away the corpse of others, so as not to crawl over the moldy worm.  Here you will need to think a little - you believe yourself or the box.  If you still with the herd and death is red, do not worry.  Mark a week or a month, and they will score you for a half a cup or just for nothing - and what a great exit, not for long to suffer.  This is not a joke, seriously, think, and you need it - to live?  This is a hard and ungrateful job; in the end, all the same, you will die and that's all.  If you agree, what for then to read it all further - aftar, a beast, is worn out by everyone, does not ‚Äúrespect‚Äù, does not hurry to like it - how about such moral injuries to you, especially since I will continue to mock.  While I scratched you on the bristles. <br><br>  Why "on the bristle."  People are pigs, jackals and people.  Here we are with you pigs.  Jackal one or two to the company of pigs, this is about.  Maybe one to two companies.  Seems like more?  No, it's just that some pigs have learned how to mow under a jackal, and turn brown until they see a knife.  People who are people you have never seen and never will see.  If you are a jackal, you will not finish reading it;  mean you're a pig.  And you're a stupid pig.  If you were a smart pig, you wouldn't even take such a blizzard.  This is elementary logic: smart pigs really value their time and do not waste time reading about such abstract, paranoid and nonpositive things.  Firstly, among smart pigs, this is zapadlo, and secondly, they constantly remember that as many pigs can be bred for these minutes for one more bag of mixed feed.  If you consider such an assessment of what is usually called a ‚Äúunique and unique Person‚Äù to be fair, then you can read further, only say first: ‚ÄúI am a stupid pig, at last I was stuck with a snout into this indisputable fact.  I will never forget about it again! ‚ÄùSo you better understand what is written further.  If it seems to you that you always understand everything, remember who you really are and how you became so;  and after all was born a man.  And do not forget, you stupid pig. <br><br>  From the receipt by the people of confirmed information about the occurrence of PPC and to the start of full-scale lawlessness, not a day, and certainly not a week, but hours.  Of course, this depends on the behavior of the cops and the military in the village, but it is wiser to focus on the minimum time - many people (whatever you think about this) have long been ready for such a development of events, and they will not delay. <br><br>  Immediately throw out of my head the option "stay in the city and rest in pain".  You will not make it.  If you think that it will be fun and simple, you again get an asshole.  SchA osnovnuyu. <br><br>  The first.  You are a pig, do not forget?  Therefore you promise exactly before the first meeting and real marauders-jackals.  Now figure out where the handful of predators are.  In the accumulation of prey, in order to minimize movement and maintain control over the feeding area.  Do you need to spin on their forks?  Chances to drastically repaint and join the predatory team you have little.  Theoretically, there is, but relying on them is suicide.  If suicide is what you want, stay. <br><br>  The second.  Staying in the city means continuous movements, and not with the purpose of killing someone and taking candy, but with a lot more dangerous and unproductive.  This goal is to control the situation; it is impossible to sit still in urban areas.  If you do not understand what it is and why it is needed - right now go to the toilet and stand there.  So you do not conceal the minus two people who will be forced to confide in you.  ‚ÄúDad said we‚Äôll wait out the riots at home.‚Äù  At first there was a niche, and then he was brought home under the knife by some guys from the second entrance, my mother and I opened it, and they fucked and killed my mother and my father, they kicked us and then we wrote off everything ... ‚ÄúChe, do you think everything?  Well equals stuffed!  Pnimash is standing here, he recklessly, like a Martian in a position, the rolls relaxed ... <br><br>  Third.  The only thing that can unscrew you from your ass named "city" is incredible luck and great experience.  Neither one nor the other in pigs does not happen, alas.  You can argue that "it is not so", only somewhere else and only about luck.  About experience, I hope you will not argue.  And they won't let you buy it, don't think: the experience of fighting in the building is acquired only and exclusively as part of a unit.  And not every unit, but under the command of a real commander;  Moreover, this experience is bad and good, and there is little good in life.  He has those who not once and not three walked around the Martan and shoved grenades into the basements, and at the same time did not catch a full belly of iron.  There are not many of them, and they, like smart guys, will immediately make a warm company something that I‚Äôve been bothering to advise you - tries from the city. <br><br>  I will add that the fact of the collapse of a familiar picture of the world provokes even healthy people to inappropriate behavior, and in addition a whole sea of ‚Äã‚Äãdifferent psychos walks between us, with and without references.  From Spitak, a few days after the area was taken under control, a whole Stolypin cannibal was sent under control - why did they think there was nothing to eat there?  In short, break the stereotype right away - ‚ÄúIf you don‚Äôt touch anyone, then nobody will touch you either.‚Äù  Touched, even as, especially in the very first days.  Then they will calm down, and start cutting each other out of some practical considerations, but first they will perekolbasyat a lot of people just like that.  If you think that these are such chernushnye jokes, close the file and read something positive, for example, search the net for something about good neighborliness and mutual assistance shown by motorists and passengers stuck on the highway either in Lensk or in Yakutsk ;  in short, somewhere in Eastern Siberia last year before last.  The words for Yandex are here: <a href="http://gl-notes.livejournal.com/891104.html">gl-notes.livejournal.com/891104.html</a> <br><br>  In addition, the exit from the city can become difficult, therefore, One Familiar Paranoid believes that it is necessary to break in the first few hours, and I agree with him: in power, until it finally collapses, there is a bad manner to limit movement in accessible territory.  It should also be understood: the longer you stretch, the more untied the bespredelschiki at the roadblocks.  The checkpoint, which at least twice a day does not congregate in all respiratory-puffing, decomposes to the ground in three to four days.  To the bottom - this means that you can be shaken out and slapped without thinking and without a special reason.  So be sure to take something for them - if you came out on time and you can not get around. <br><br>  If you leave the city without problems, do not relax: you are a pig pig model, but not all yogurts are the same.  There are people who look more like jackals and hyenas.  And they are not so stupid as ruminants, and they smelled PPC much earlier, and very much hope to meet with you;  because you, sadly, their food base.  This is me to the fact that outside the city you have to graze, and avoid any contact.  Any - it means any at all, and not just those that seem dangerous even to you.  Moreover, the crowd of other pigs doesn‚Äôt help and doesn‚Äôt save from anything - if a jackal is found in the crowd and something yours likes it, nobody wants to wave it off - it has been checked by many pigs, who naively relied on the feeling of elbow that had been eradicated from people. <br><br>  It is better to knock down the legs on the windbreak, but go alone, than on the road, but in the company.  If so, at night.  Night is generally the safest time for such mild and tasty, as we are with you - but only on familiar terrain.  Did you notice that you should not do everything ‚Äúlike all normal people‚Äù?  Some people ordered the so-called ‚Äúnormal people‚Äù of our country to die - and I‚Äôm giving a tooth, will achieve a result, as if you and I did not want to keep our pig lifestyle.  The normal way of life of a human being is war.  The sooner and more fully you realize this, the more chances your puppies grow, and yours will die humanly.  You lived as a pig, which is already there, but how you die is up to you. <br><br>  Speaking of war and any such army.  For the effectiveness of actions in the group there is a wonderful technology that dramatically increases the chances of the group that has mastered it.  It is called "unity of command".  This is when everyone obeys one with the probability of execution of the order of more than 0.5.  If you are going to lead a family, immediately click on the woman in the face, before leaving.  First, designate that there is a martial law in the house, and at the slightest disobedience (and it will not force itself to wait), do it a couple of times - serious things reach the women slowly.  It is important to do this with a muzzle like a Terminator, then you will not have to upgrade along the way;  and do it right away.  After it will be late, when it starts to slow down and scores on the execution of commands.  Children in this regard are much more reliable and savvy comrades, and it will be wise if you listen to what they feel and feel free to consult with them. <br><br>  If some people seem to be safe companions for you, know that you are halfway to a hole in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãvital organs.  You are safe here, since someone seemed safe to you.  People judge by themselves, agree?  That is why do not have anything voluminous with you.  Predatory people will surely think that you carry various useful things and rudely separate you from them.  This, by the way, can make you even the same pigs as you, only more resolute. <br><br>  Here we come to the main thing.  How to make it so that you have everything, but for you there was no niche.  Popular wisdom: If you want to be healthy, eat alone in the dark.  Before you there is an elementary strategic task: to ensure the preservation in the ranks of a ridiculous amount of personnel not leading active actions.  Simple questions: How to prevent the destruction of l / s many times superior enemy forces?  Retreat, ensuring sufficient distance between the l / s and the enemy.  How to ensure the supply of l / s during the retreat, before the occupation of the MTD (place of permanent deployment) and deployment of the rear service?  Create reserves.  What is the probability to use the created reserves in the conditions of the enemy's maneuvering by the reserves, and the overwhelming superiority of the enemy in manpower and technology?  Zero or close to that.  How to increase this probability to acceptable values?  The reserves should be removed from the place of the likely activity of the enemy, dispersed, concealed from the enemy their movement, ensuring for themselves that access to them is unhindered, taking into account possible changes in the situation. <br><br>  Nychka the first serves to ensure arrival to the nychka main.  What in it to nykat, see for yourself, this question depends on too many associated factors to specify something.  The only thing that H1 should have in any way is a pill from those who twist your hand behind your ear and make it show.  This should be very well remembered, and it is desirable to realize it at all: from the moment of the announcement of gut you are meat.  You are no longer a full-time senior manager or accountant in good standing, with ramish and gaap, but weak fatty meat that anyone can poke a piece of iron.  And no nychka will not save you, if you are brought to her under the white wings unshaven guys, like the word "cattle", which you so love to screw on occasion.  Love, do not excuse yourself.  First, you will see how your little stitch is gutted, then you will see vaguely familiar guts, and then - very close, but not for long - a cute ant on a blade of grass.  So remember - the little thing, not protected from the accidents of an unpleasant property, is not yours, even though you paid for it and buried it.  To become your nychka, need protection.  What it will be - a knife tied to a branch with a scabbard, Arthur a sword in a rock, a grenade or its dummy - you decide, but I‚Äôd get it doubled, if I didn‚Äôt touch such a thing.  So, cutting tails. <br><br>  Simple situation - you are led to H1 under the barrel.  You quickly calmed down, all the way behaved talented and no one is afraid of you.  On the approach to the nychka it turns out that the very nychka has very little space, and it is impossible to approach everyone.  There is enough space only for you, and the candidate for the dead N1, the rest will have to wait aside.  (If the terrain allows, do H1 in such a place, so that before it it was necessary to climb the mountain along the only possible route, and halfway down the device, unnoticeable canopy from solid cobblestones) You take the candidate to a nychka, he sees , ‚ÄúStep to the side - I will tear off the head‚Äù, to untie your hands and force you to pull out the candy yourself.  How to achieve this?  The easiest way - again, the selection of places.  Nychka should be in a place where it is simply dangerous to reach it - either a blockage falls on your head, or you fall into a deep ravine. <br><br>  So, your hands are untied, you bend down to lift the first board out from under the sod, and you get rid of the ergeocho without a ring.  Or you cut the belt yourself about being hammered into a secluded (at belt level) place a piece of relish cloth from a mechanical saw.  (Lubricated with litol and put on a plastic bag.) Estimate in advance, where about you will be pushed to stand-show, there and beat 2-3 such things.  By the way, one or two (if super lucky) escort men can be planted on them by the way.  If you are a rich guy, attach the same grenades or models, a knife or a light bulb.  The psychological effect of transforming a weeping chmoshnik into an insolent reptile with efkoy in hand is huge, maybe you don‚Äôt even have to shout ‚ÄúDrop the trunks!  Running, fuck !!!  I‚Äôll put it out !!! ‚Äù, an unprepared person is very afraid of a grenade, even if he was a jackal three times.<font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">However, if you are completely unlucky and experienced creatures take you into circulation, you can always deal with them, only the price will be higher - but if your little thing will save your family, you will be glad about that. Even against experienced reptiles there is an unkillable scrap - the same ahead of time on the route of the grenade (IED), or Hochma, about which below. Along the way, you fall several times to get used and not strained. The last time you fall with tied hands on a grenade tied with a good wire to a good stone, you pull out a pre-compressed check and the sound of the rebounded lever + 1 sec. playfully roll back. You can not get a meter, if the place is prepared, and the ears return on the third day. Best of all - notch, it will send the energy of the explosion as you need. (Ideally, the 400th checker with UZRGM, a natural excavation in a solid rock base,and a quarter of a cube of a sharp stone with a fraction of one or two fists - only to roll back for something on the side of the axis of direction and behind the wave front, bits of all other problems will swing on the surviving trees in the most respectful distance. Rolling something in my lip, huh?) Rolling back - the dawning and the ears are easier, and you leave those in neponyatka, they will gobble up, their eyes bulging - who is there for the ass? If you roll back silently, they will immediately smell and zalyagut.bulging eyes - who is there chmoshnika ass fucked? If you roll back silently, they will immediately smell and zalyagut.bulging eyes - who is there chmoshnika ass fucked? If you roll back silently, they will immediately smell and zalyagut.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Now, about simple, but very funny jokes. Hochma for places where there is a cliff ‚Äî by forcing the pidaras (as always, picking up a place) to pile up on a patch, you with a businesslike appearance or like that should push a hefty Kamenyuk off the cliff. To the kamenyuk it turns out to be either tied-up-quadruped barbed wire, or a tattered rope, or you can think up it yourself and carefully dig it around the circumference of the site. The second end, of course, tightly fixed on the cliff. It is clear that pidaras blows like pins. Maybe even from the cliff - it's really as lucky. (If there is a chance of falling, then the landing site is also being prepared) This is two to three to five seconds of your time, during this period you can simply smash a couple of pidos with rebar, sharpened at both ends and rewound in the middle for greater uvatistosti. This is me about the one that you will dig near Kamenyuki,and you drag the wire out and wind it on a noticeable knot, such as ingrown into the ground.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In the same way, Hochmas are arranged not with a thorn loop, but with a ‚Äúfallen and peacefully lying tree‚Äù, in which the lower branches are cut to slip, and the top of the cable is bounded from the bumpling shaft or trunk on the top; if you are the head of the mechanic, then you can even cringe at all, you understand the principle. Navari, for example, on old cutters of sharpened reinforcement and pass the cable through them - just carefully grease and wrap when you bury. I will repeat - most importantly, choose the approach to the nychka so that the location of the pidaras on the approach can be accurately predicted, and it is easy to harm the person right up to the cessation of breathing. The best source of energy for all such hochmas is a cliff or mountainside.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Okay, suppose you were lucky and you brought your family to H1. You need to go further, to NG - nymke main. Now imagine your family, which passed the night forest of five kilometers, and think about what should be in H1.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It became bad? If not, then you are either not thinking at all or very rich. When you think well, it should be bad; this tab climbs bucks under seven hundred or eight hundred minimum (for three). And now another news - you should make at least two such nychek. And more news - about the location of at least one you should not know. So as not to blab who does not need. Do not think that you are such a pioneer-hero - who really wanted to, split you in five minutes, and you can‚Äôt say only in one case - if you don‚Äôt know. Naturally, this is not necessary if you are going to walk on your own. In the development of this direction, such a countermeasure, such as creating false nychek, perfectly fits, so that, if they took it in the ass, bring the reptiles to a pit filled with the same kind of thing as a normal nympha, but something just a little and everything is cheap.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Now about the road to NG. The radius at which it makes sense to locate the NG from a populated area should exceed the distance of the daylight crossing with light, the distance should be inconvenient. Coming out in the morning to track you, a clever reptile, the enemy must come to a place where it is worth sniffing more densely at the worst hour when it is dark and it's time to sleep, and not look for anything. It all depends on the area, this distance can be 5 or 40 km. The exception is quite large NPs, such as Ekaterinburg or Samara. From them and seventy miles will not be superfluous. I generally keep quiet about Moscow - hundreds and a half to run from it.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">So, why such a distance - the zone of daily walking will be scoured like a city park. Please note that this is a ski course, so plan accordingly, just remember that the distance on the map is not equal to the distance in fact. The OZP (to one paranoid friend) knows the places from which it is possible to distinguish a passenger car traveling through the city, while remaining completely inaccessible. Also hack down the following:</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The location of the NG should be as far as possible from small settlements, since the local population shies through the forest extremely actively, knows the forest, and can scratch your nychka the next day after the laying. A distance closer than 10 km is unacceptable, it is ‚Äúnot far from here‚Äù by the village standards, and children go to such distances jokingly. Children - this is the main danger to nychki in peacetime. On the other hand, they can be easily distracted - do something ‚Äúinteresting‚Äù a hundred meters away, and the problem is solved.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">NG location near the road - zer gut. In peacetime, there are already fewer mushroom pickers, and there are no hunters yet. Speaking of hunters, the paths to the meadows, on which the ‚Äúbottle-canned‚Äù hunters gathered, will become a very busy place, and it is necessary to foresee that the future path between the nearest NPs and this Klondike does not pass near NG. In general, special attention should be paid to forecasting the future economic activity of the neighbors, and positioning them so that they are not adjacent to areas of the area that are to become more lively. Here, first of all, it is necessary to take into account the mowing - the OZP ran across the penny in the middle of a forest clearing and twenty kilometers from the village, and it was not the Jaeger penny.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The location of NG in the selected area should proceed from the main principle of the device nychek - they should be done there, where no one will climb. In those places that a normal person will walk in a wide arc. In each locality they are different, and it is useless to specify it. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The second thing to consider. Two reptiles can destroy your little thing - man and water, nobody else. What is the use of a nychka that no one has found, but everything is spoiled by water. So - choose a uniquely dry place. These are even on the swamp, just enough to climb on it well. And do not regret polyethylene, the thicker and more - the better, it will be useful to you as well. Polyethylene, especially thick, in PPC conditions is the most demanded building material, which cannot be replaced by anything else.</font></font><br><br>  Third.<font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">NG should be located on the nickle, the entrance to which is tweet, and the exit is the ruble. That is, the tactical characteristics of the terrain should evoke a smug smile in those who are in it, and those who are looking outside will have a mortal longing and desire to drop everything and return home as soon as possible. Ideally, bringing the tail, you should easily sit there for as long as you need, without any problems mocking at the problem-sticking chase. At the same time remember that even Sun Tzu wrote about the "fire attack". (If you don‚Äôt bother to read one of the most important books, live to the bluff, remember what you said about pigs and people, and make sure again.) </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The rest of the requirements for the Nymko Main come from those read.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It makes no sense to disclose the contents of NG - I will only note that it should consist of two parts. Part one, the most important, necessary and important - Capital. Yes Yes. It is impossible to leave a market economy in a mountain forest - when the gut comes, then it will be meaningless to expect that ‚Äúeverything will become normal‚Äù. "As it was" will never be. So, everything that you can exchange for daily earnings, after His Coming you cannot earn in a year. And for four, I will add. You can work out the prognosis here for a long time, but I advise you to take into account the experience gained today. You do not know that many of our fellow citizens are practicing survival right now, and no further, how is it half an hour from you?</font></font> Got it?  Right.<font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Tea, smoke, lard and sweets. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">More precisely, the smoke, tea, lard and sweet, like this, in descending order of value, practice shows. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">One amendment - the prisoner does not have a gun, so the Big Five lacks one position - ammunition. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Separately stored - primer, cartridge case, gunpowder in unopened jars. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Weights, measures, twists, grease and other crap. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Boots and accessories for shoes remote, coarse calico and flannel (it costs everything). </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Kiln gadgets, thick polyethylene, steel wire (this is the most valuable item in the forest), saw sharpened, hand still sold? </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Yes, count it yourself, how will the surviving people live and what it needs to be buit. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The second part of NG is important, but it is unnecessary to dwell on it: it is clear to everyone that he should have an annual hike in nature.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> On the nychka for the construction of MTD (permanent deployment). </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">To build something in peacetime is pointless - everything will be, at best, izgazheno and broken, but rather all that you build, good people will burn. What makes sense is to buy and collect a log house. Fit, number and roll back. Then drag (independently; or cut the tractor driver later) on the tractor carriage to the MPD, and fold it on the poles, rolling it up with a thick wire (6- to such a state that the farmer, who has found your nychka, scratched his head and spat: Nothing, but so much fussing, well, well, damn them, and lay down in a hole, where either a cast iron stove or a set of oven fittings with the necessary amount of brick and chamotte are already buried. If you don‚Äôt like to work with your bare hands, you can add some tool.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Such training will take you at least four years, and no less than a dozen of money. Think about whether it makes sense to bathe, when to die is much faster and cheaper, and the remaining time to "live like a human being." The only minus of the option to ‚Äúdie out‚Äù is a terrible smell, from which Rexon will not help, and a bad credit history - which is much more serious. Here is the path of a pig unwilling to become fertilizer. In short, see for yourself, everything is chewed. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">This is how you can, if you really want to, miss out on the fresh air for a year or two of the most fun time. And then either you will die, or the infrastructure scattered from the ashes will suddenly be revived from the ashes, or a new, already truly democratic government will build you a house, give a velfer and run water, gas with electricity and fast as diarrhea Internet.
