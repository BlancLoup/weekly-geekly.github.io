  <section class="page js-page"><h1>To be or not to be paid advertising on social networks - Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Are you wondering if it makes sense to advertise on a social network?  A huge number of people are registered on Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn (let's call them intelligently - demographic profiles), if handled skillfully, this factor can provide good advertising opportunities. <br>  All three platforms are constantly coming up with new and improving the old ways of advertising.  In social media, the main thing that any marketer needs is a huge amount of information about users (or target audience).  Thus, these sites provide a wide field for conducting advertising experiments with potential buyers / clients. <br>  As a result, each advertiser chooses a certain social platform, which becomes the most useful for him, it all depends on the business goal. <br>  In this article, I will look at the advertising opportunities that exist on Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn, taking into account the maximum impact on the consumer and receiving feedback. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  <b>Facebook</b> <br>  It can be considered the most famous platform with the provision of a huge number of advertising opportunities.  It is used in most cases.  Also, the advantage is that even a small business can afford it. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/a4afa999/1617a5f9/580eb761/6543c2b5.png"><br>  As the platform is still evolving, CPC prices are acceptable compared to channels such as Yandex.Direct. <br>  Facebook allows you to target your advertising messages according to various criteria that are specified in the user profile.  For example, you need women 25-30 years old who are addicted to jazz music.  You are welcome!  Exhibit the necessary criteria and your women 25-30 years. <br>  It's safe to say that advertising on Facebook will be effective in the B2C segment, since all social factors are taken into account.  You can also plan your advertising campaign based on the geography of your end-user location. <br>  But in the B2B segment advertising will not be effective, because most of the information in the profile (brand page) still carries the personality character of the person who filled it. <br>  Advertising can also help attract likes to the official page in order to further grow an active community.  But do not forget that the page itself must also contain interesting content, otherwise your community may become large, but still not active.  In general, one advertising will not get off. <br><br>  <b>LinkedIn Ads</b> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/a324df45/f672814a/e0e858e8/d0072a30.png"><br>  A wonderful professional community that is not as popular as the one mentioned above, but nevertheless it is a great way to attract a B2B segment. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/328f036b/29f85353/679c06b7/9e29f845.png"><br>  LinkedIn will allow you to show ads only to people with a specific qualification or position, for example, a programmer or a marketing director.  Accordingly, you effectively spend money on advertising. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/2ec32ede/4ab75bc0/8622644c/d6fec182.png"><br>  When setting up your advertising campaign, LinkedIn will make sure there are any suitable communities that may be useful for you.  In groups, people spend a lot of time, because it is there that they discuss business issues and problems. <br>  Now advertising on LinkedIn is actively developing and growing, so it can be assumed that in the near future prices may rise significantly.  Now in Russia, units are advertised there, but the Russian community exists.  We conclude that it is better to be ahead of everyone.  Now you have more chance to stand out and be seen.

      <b>Twitter</b> <br>  Currently, the most underdeveloped advertising platform is Twitter.  Only big brands are eligible for Sponsored Tweets and Promoted Trends. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/c385fc06/875da83c/97099daa/b5843c79.png"><br>  Advertisers pay to be in the top when using a particular hashtag or in a search. <br>  As a result, advertising on Twitter is not achievable for most applicants.  But it is likely that this platform will soon begin to offer advertising to smaller customers. <br><br>  <b>Let's sum up:</b> <br>  1. Marketers should think about their target audience and start experimenting with social media. <br>  2. Each site offers something different in advertising communications.  You need to choose your network and method of advertising. <br>  3. First, it is better not to invest large sums in one social network, try to invest a little in different ones.  This will help you find the most suitable option. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/119332/">https://habr.com/ru/post/119332/</a></p>
