  <section class="page js-page"><h1>HeadHunter 2014 programmers start recruiting</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  A new, already the fifth annual recruitment of <a href="http://school.hh.ru/">HeadHunter programmers</a> to <a href="http://school.hh.ru/">school</a> for the 2014-2015 season has opened today.  During the first part of training, students are waiting for the lectures of our specialists, and during the second, the children will have the opportunity to apply knowledge in the team development of their own projects.  Classes will be held from November to May 2015 on weekdays in the evenings in the Moscow office of the technical department HeadHunter near the metro station "Alekseevskaya". <br><br>  This year, the training program covers the entire stack of technologies we use: from Java and Python to JavaScript and XSLT.  In the second part of the training, students will receive a monthly stipend of 15 thousand rubles, and the best students will receive an invitation to join our team. <br><br>  Admission consists of three simple steps: you need to <a href="http://school.hh.ru/">fill out a questionnaire</a> , perform a test task in Java or Python and pass a face-to-face interview.

Of the 12 people who entered the school last fall, 7 reached the second part (team projects). They created prototypes of hh.ru resume-builder interfaces and search for vacancies, including search for vacancies on a map for mobile applications.  As a result, the set turned out to be very successful - 6 people joined our team right away: one person joined the Android application team, and five of them work with the frontend-part.  The only graduate to whom we could not make an offer, also found a good employer a month and a half after graduation. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/56d/c93/715/56dc937157e040468f4df608702b2e1b.jpg"><br><br><h4>  What will happen this year </h4><br>  The task of the fifth anniversary set is to prepare full-stack developers, not limited to knowledge of specific tools and technologies, but capable of solving a wide range of practical tasks.  Last year‚Äôs school fully resolved the technical department‚Äôs requirements for Android and frontend developers, so this year we are returning to the classic format. <br><br><h5>  The first part - lectures </h5><br>  The training program is quite diverse: we will tell students about Java and the various frameworks we use ourselves, about Python and its use for developing asynchronous web services.  A separate course of lectures will be devoted to frontend-development: JavaScript, CSS and XSLT.  Teachers will talk about the architecture and operation of high-load services, flexible methodologies and engineering practices.  More detailed program can be <a href="http://school.hh.ru/">found on the school website</a> . <br><br>  Lectures will be delivered <a href="http://school.hh.ru/">by HeadHunter specialists</a> , many of whom have been doing this for more than a year, and some were themselves once our students.  Time and dates of classes will be coordinated with the applicants, so that it is convenient for everyone to learn.  In addition to the lectures, during the first half of the course homework is provided for, so I think I recommend that you plan to do it in advance to plan for 10-15 hours per week.  "Slash" from homework will not work: for poor progress or lack of motivation, students can be expelled from school - such precedents were, therefore, immediately tune in to serious work. <br><br><h5>  The second part - team projects </h5><br>  During the second part of the training, students of the School will work on full-fledged team projects under the guidance of our curators, project managers and designers.  During the work on the projects a scholarship in the amount of 15 thousand rubles will be paid to students. <br><br>  The HeadHunter school of programmers is designed mainly for undergraduate students, recent graduates and graduate students, young specialists: for all of them this is a great chance to systematize knowledge, to get real practice of working in a team, and perhaps continue to develop as a member of our development team.  Although at once I will make a reservation that we do not set any restrictions on age and education, so we welcome everyone who wants to study and work with us.  If you are already a person with experience and knowledge, it is better to immediately send a resume to our hunter Ksenia Zueva: <a href="">k.zueva@hh.ru</a> or respond to <a href="http://hh.ru/hh">vacancies on the site</a> . <br><br>  During the four years we have been conducting the School, <a href="http://school.hh.ru/">15 graduates</a> have become my colleagues, almost all of them work with us so far.  If you have questions about the school, ask them in the comments or write to the mail <a href="">devschool@hh.ru</a> . <br><br>  This year, the set will last until the end of September, applications are <a href="http://school.hh.ru/">already open</a> , welcome.  See you in class! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/4b5/d3d/8e6/4b5d3d8e64b346b296f59b6a623ef403.jpg"></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/235503/">https://habr.com/ru/post/235503/</a></p>
