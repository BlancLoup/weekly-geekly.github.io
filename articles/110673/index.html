Today, the hero of the review was a new "ee-e-pis", the most pleasant feature of which is a practical matte case and screen.  But there is something else interesting in it, which I will briefly describe below. <br><br> <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/asus/blog/110673/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/3f3/f55/182/3f3f5518274ac3806be6f17ab828cbd7.jpg" alt="image"></a> <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Today is Friday, which means readers who are tired of the week can not be heavily loaded) Well, yes, I will not.  Just tell a few words about the new netbook, which I had to use the other day.  I'll tell you very briefly, because there is nothing fundamentally new in it - this netbook has a lot in common with those I have already <b><a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/asus/blog/104234/">mentioned</a></b> (for example, the <b><a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/asus/blog/86127/">1008P KR</a></b> or <b><a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/asus/blog/104234/">1018P</a></b> ).  But this modification has some interesting differences, the most interesting of which is a matte screen.

      So, <b>ASUS EeePC 1015PEM</b> .  Once I wrote <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/asus/blog/88684/">an article about labeling</a> ASUS netbooks and laptops - if you refresh this information in memory, the following becomes clear from the title: <br><br>  " <b>10</b> " means the diagonal of the screen - in this case it is 10.1 ".  The standard resolution of netbooks with such a diagonal is 1024x600 - in this case it is. <br><br>  ‚Äú <b>15</b> ‚Äù is simply a serial number for the model.  Roughly speaking, after the popular "thousandth" models, this is almost the fifteenth. <br><br>  " <b>P</b> " says that the Intel Atom processor (Pine Trail) is installed inside.  In this case, this is true ... moreover, this is one of the first netbooks to which they installed a new dual- <a href="http://ark.intel.com/Product.aspx%3Fid%3D50154">core Intel¬Æ Atom ‚Ñ¢ N550</a> processor with a clock frequency of 1.5GHz (released in Q3 2010). <br><br>  The letter " <b>E</b> " means that the model comes with a high-capacity battery (Extended?).  In fact, each time it is something different, but this time the capacity is relatively small - 5200 mAh. <br><br>  " <b>M</b> ".  Honestly, I do not know the exact meaning of this letter in the name of the model, but apparently, it is directly related to the word "Memory".  For example, in this model 2GB of RAM is installed (DDR3), while in many netbooks they still put one.  Well, the hard drive is very voluminous - 160, 250 or 320GB. <br><br>  Looking at the name alone, it is already possible to draw some conclusions about what we have in front of us.  Roughly speaking - a compact netbook of average performance (as far as I know, a discrete NVIDIA Ion is not put in a model with a 10 ‚Äùscreen), which, thanks to its long-playing battery, can easily turn into an excellent‚Äú marching version ‚Äù.  Looking ahead, something like this in practice turned out to be, therefore, if such a description still interests you, then you can safely read it. <br><br><h2>  Specifications ASUS EeePC 1015PEM </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/277/e65/825/277e65825229d6dc9388bb7d4be90050.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>Processor</b> : <a href="http://ark.intel.com/Product.aspx%3Fid%3D50154">Intel¬Æ Atom ‚Ñ¢ N550</a> (1.5GHz, 2 cores, 1MB L2) <br>  <b>Chipset</b> : Intel¬Æ NM10 <br>  <b>RAM</b> : 2048MB (DDR3) <br>  <b>Hard Drive</b> : 160, 250 or 320GB (2.5 ‚Äù, SATA2, 5400ob / m) + 500GB for EeeStorage <br>  <b>Graphics Card</b> : Intel¬Æ GMA 3150 <br>  <b>Screen</b> : 10.1 ", opaque (1024600, with LED illumination) <br>  <b>Interfaces</b> : 3xUSB 2.0, VGA, Head Phone, Mic-in, RJ45 (gigabit) <br>  <b>Optical drive</b> : no <br>  <b>Card reader</b> : SD / MMC / MS / MSPro / xD <br>  <b>Webcam</b> : 0.3 megapixel <br>  <b>Wireless</b> : Bluetooth v.3, 802.11b / g / n <br>  <b>Battery</b> : Li-Ion (6 cells; 5200 mAh, 56Wh);  there are others, including banana <br>  <b>Battery life</b> : 11 (6 cells, 63Wh), 8.5 (56Wh), 6 (48Wh) or 3 (23Wh) hours <br>  <b>Operating System</b> : Microsoft¬Æ Windows 7 Starter + ASUS ExpressGate <br>  <b>Dimensions</b> : 262x179x23.6 ~ 36.4 mm <br>  <b>Weight</b> : 1.1 ~ 1.25kg (with battery) <br><br><h2>  Appearance </h2><br>  There are several body colors (judging by the flare, there are also glossy variations) - I collected their range in one picture: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/29c/09b/99b/29c09b99b68875151294122c750ea7fc.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  In my case, there was a black matte case with rounded shapes, completely unmarked: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/70e/338/f7c/70e338f7c8b6d6dc8ad3d6ef5aee2ff0.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The reverse side has a pleasant rough texture, rubber feet and a compartment for accessing the RAM.  There is no direct access to the hard disk, so the installation of the SSD-drive can result in a small warranty problem.  Or it may not spill out :) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/cfd/c6b/048/cfdc6b0489b54e9ab57a0306343f3230.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The lithium-ion battery (A32-1015; this one is suitable for the EeePC 1015xxxx 1016xxxx 1215xxxx and VX6xxxx) models has a capacity of 5200mAh (+ 10.95V, 56Wh), which is not so much for an ‚ÄúE‚Äù - if you recall, the 1000PE model has a battery was already at 8700mAh!  But on the other hand, in this case, the battery almost does not stick out of the case, on the contrary - it creates a small ledge, convenient for ‚Äúgrip‚Äù and transportation.  As in some other models, there is a connector for installing a SIM card behind the battery, despite the fact that support for work in 3G networks is not officially announced.  There was a great desire to disassemble and see what was inside, but most likely, there is just a little room for the optional installation of the corresponding module. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/8ce/38a/465/8ce38a465032d0d780ccd14b37f20404.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/119/1a4/c65/1191a4c65095b34562642c04ebb61b76.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  All connectors are standard, as is their location.  Neither the front nor the back is nothing. <br><br>  Inside the open "book" is not so cloudless - I have a frame around the screen, which, damn it, is glossy.  Like some area around the keyboard ... well, they could not resist, sorry) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/3c5/1e0/bc3/3c51e0bc3350dbc4071eabcd080925b2.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  But as I said, there is also good news - the screen is completely matte, from the bottom left pixel to the top right.  The touchpad and all the space around it is made of matte plastic. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/3f9/863/e46/3f9863e464f8c88f371c0f8658202725.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Contrary to all traditions, the only touchpad button has become matte.  Nicely! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/f6a/91b/57e/f6a91b57e4238248dc17f54a8cf93e7e.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The keyboard is standard - despite the slightly reduced key sizes, it is quite possible to overclock it with a ten-finger method.  Two buttons "Fn" and two "Shift", the correct "Enter", "Backspace" and without an extra left slash - all great.  It is especially nice that this is not a ‚Äúoverseas‚Äù engineering sample with a European layout - this is exactly the layout of this netbook if you place an order right now :) The only thing I didn‚Äôt like was the reduced arrows. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/ef6/f13/46b/ef6f1346b614c4550392c1050af1a984.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Multitouch touchpad by Elantech. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/82f/4b6/7a5/82f4b67a5453f4bbc3b8a2d4d42ae368.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The body is full of stickers, which I advise you to unstick immediately after purchase - it can be sideways later.  Nevertheless, they write on the biggest sticker, they say, inside the Intel Atom N550 processor, the Bluetooth 3.0 module, preinstalled by <b><a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/asus/blog/88512/">ASUS ExpressGate,</a></b> and that the netbook may work up to 11.5 hours.  Turn on. <br><br><h2>  Netbook work </h2><br>  The only thing that is heard at startup is a working hard drive, so installing an SSD drive will make the netbook almost completely silent and less warm (after all, an ordinary HDD in a load heats up everything else in a complex). <br><br>  Alternative OS (pre-installed ASUS ExpressGate) is loaded in 7 seconds - the latest version of this small Linux distribution is on board.  This distribution is really very small, there‚Äôs really no one to ‚Äúeat‚Äù the resources ... but already here you can look at the power indicator and see that the battery life is unlikely to be released in 6 hours.  No, wait.  Turning off wi-fi and doing the minimum brightness of the display ... and we see that the figure has increased to 8.5 hours - well, this figure is much more interesting, but it‚Äôs far from 11 hours (I decided to google and found what I‚Äôve found. It turns out for this netbook ( and for a handful of others that I mentioned above) there are at least 4 versions of the batteries - in each of them there are 6 cells, but the capacity of these cells is different. For example, the largest (in Watt-hours) is 63Wh, followed by is 56Wh (as in this netbook) and then uninteresting, but compact 48 and 23Wh. So if you are lucky to find  on this very 63Vtch, then squeeze 11+ hours is quite possible, I think. <br><br>  While typing the previous paragraph, I suddenly realized that the opening angle of the lid was too small - when the netbook was on my lap, I wanted to open the ‚Äúbigger‚Äù screen. <br><br>  When you first start the netbook goes through some ten-minute initialization, which I get tired every time :) Upon completion - 32-bit Windows 7 Starter. With all the ‚Äúfirewood‚Äù and a handful of unnecessary software (if you download it, then the netbook boot time can be greatly reduced ).  Initially, the boot time is 35 seconds. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/326/a5a/421/326a5a421e3b554ed0abe0f6f75b6f1d.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The resolution is 1024x600 - as my practice has shown, it is quite possible to work for this ... but sitting now for 24 ‚Äù, I understand that a higher resolution would be much better.  Alas, for 10 "such a standard. <br><br>  The webcam has a shutter - as a software is a functional <b>CyberLink YouCam</b> .  With insufficient light from an incandescent bulb, the image is very yellow, but in daylight everything is fine. <br><br>  Inside there is a dual- <a href="http://ark.intel.com/Product.aspx%3Fid%3D49490">core Intel¬Æ Atom ‚Ñ¢ N550 processor</a> , the nominal clock frequency of which is 1.5 GHz.  Depending on the mode of operation, the frequency may be less or vice versa, a little more.  There is also an integrated graphics core Intel¬Æ GMA 3150 - I do not want to repeat once again about its capabilities ... I can only say that among the netbooks of this class (10 "") this bundle is probably the most productive.  Behind all this you can work quite comfortably (office, Internet, HD-video, simple games), but to play Crysis and do three-dimensional modeling is better at home in the hospital :) <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/cd8/d0a/753/cd8d0a7539641cb4a7c30c634e3d8edd.png" alt="image"></a> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/560/85b/5b2/56085b5b23fa39e8e2f135c9fb9c5c55.png" alt="image"></a> <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/828/11a/b1e/82811ab1ecf1232a10b2c8cfbbb47f1d.png" alt="image"></a> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/30a/96c/529/30a96c52972f8f1a191ad4bd0196deb9.png" alt="image"></a> <br><br>  Memory.

But in practice, it turned out to be quite a good and practical netbook, which can be safely recommended to active users with undemanding tasks.  Compactness, performance, autonomy, appearance - all this is rather well intertwined together.  So if the shortcomings I found do not bother you, then by the new year you can have time to make yourself a nice gift in the form of this everyday assistant. <br><br>  I also advise you to pay attention to the model <b>ASUS EeePC 1015PN</b> - there is almost all the same, only with pearl buttons.  I mean, also with NVIDIA Ion 2!
