The application, ‚ÄúMoscow's Assistant,‚Äù which has gained popularity among Muscovites, who are eager to punish violators of the metropolitan parking rules with a long and not very ruble, will soon introduce an incentive incentive option for each piece of useful information.  This measure, according to the authorities of Moscow, will help, if not completely free, then significantly improve the situation with countless violations of parking rules and chronic non-payment of parking stations.  In addition to the existing options, in the very near future, the application will acquire options for recognizing offenders who neglect the restrictions of the signs ‚ÄúParking and stopping is prohibited‚Äù and the possibility of fixing violations related to parking on sidewalks and pedestrian crossings. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/bfb/734/6d8/bfb7346d8c4ad9ed7981e8efc79d9d5e.jpg" alt="image"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Who does not know about the initiative of the city authorities, we recall that at the end of August last year, the Moscow Department of Transport, together with the Moscow mayor's office, announced the application ‚ÄúAssistant of Moscow‚Äù, which for the first 4 days already 13,500 people downloaded.  Probably the owners of iOS and Android devices in the capital really liked the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãjoining a cohort of photo and video inspectors, and at the same time to teach the utterly beloved owners of vehicles who parked cars where and how it was necessary.  To access this opportunity, a voluntary private inspector will need to register on the <a href="https://pgu.mos.ru/ru/">‚ÄúGosSlugi‚Äù</a> portal, after which he will have the full right to identify vehicles whose owners have not repaid parking in the parking zone, fix their vehicles to the camera and send data to the traffic police, as well as receive the opportunity exchange the accumulated bonuses of the Active Citizen program to which the Moscow Helper is tied for parking space and other incentive prizes. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/50f/181/a7d/50f181a7d7d34561b7fa7c15bc5f9ae8.jpg">

      If initially the program‚Äôs capabilities were limited to controlling the drivers who did not pay for parking in accordance with the established regulations, over the past six months the application has undergone significant refinement.  In an interview with journalists, the deputy mayor said that after the update, released a few days ago, active users will be able to report information about violators who have placed personal or commercial vehicles directly in the traffic police.  Such an opportunity is provided by the ‚ÄúAssistant‚Äù, thanks to the connection to the database of the electronic map of the city, which now contains data on the road network and on all signs registered today in the territory of the capital. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/3a9/3ff/592/3a93ff592d3b4823b573a04d801c6873.jpg"><br><br>  In order to form a violation report, a car, in accordance with the program‚Äôs instructions, needs to be photographed from several angles so that it is possible to distinguish the license plate and the road sign, whose requirements have been violated.  If the algorithm is not violated, the Assistant will automatically identify the number, tie it to the geotag, and send the data to the traffic police to further fix the offense and make a decision.  The collected photo and video information sent to the traffic police will go through a standard processing procedure, after which the violator will receive a corresponding notice of the fine. <br><br>  Thus, as the authorities of the capital expect, "... the capabilities of the surveillance cameras of the existing city network will be significantly expanded and supplemented by the activity of conscious residents of the city." <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/834/3e2/6e7/8343e26e78c9444cbd270fde4d1a2adb.jpg"><br><br>  As the deputy mayor of the capital noted, ‚ÄúMoscow's Assistant‚Äù today is the only application that has been certified for measurement accuracy, correctness and immutability of data, which makes it possible to regard the information in users' messages not as an appeal from citizens, but as a basis for issuing a fine.  The application can be installed on any modern smartphone that has a camera with a resolution of 5 megapixels and above, 50 megabytes of free space and a GPS / GLONASS receiver. <br><br>  As the authorities of the capital inform, until recently, the activity of the users of the Moscow Helper application did not imply any material stimulation, now, for the manifested consciousness of ‚Äúwalking‚Äù Muscovites and car enthusiasts, they will stimulate with bonuses on a fixed scale.  Thus, each set penalty, in addition to moral satisfaction, will bring the user to the ‚ÄúHelper‚Äù 200 conditional points, and in some cases (which are not yet reported) up to 2000 points.  Further bonuses can be converted within the municipal program for certain privileges, such as free parking hours for car enthusiasts, etc. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b4f/850/7fc/b4f8507fc45f4cde942abc58e7ef7e27.jpg"><br><br>  The application ‚ÄúAssistant of Moscow‚Äù, which has already begun to bring the city treasury a tangible income, is replenished with new opportunities.  New features of the application were presented on March 14, 2016 at the exhibition as part of the meeting of the Presidium of the State Council of Russia on road safety.  The developers promise that in the near future, the program will be able to identify and violate parking rules at pedestrian crossings and sidewalks, which rightly irritates pedestrians, who often literally maneuver in the miraculously remaining free openings between the carelessly parked Lexuses and Rovers.  And, according to the authors of the development, studying reviews, opinions and wishes of users, they ask to connect such functions literally from the first days of launching the application. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/00c/684/65a/00c68465af7b4cc68bc0a1a2d521ffce.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/44d/b99/a34/44db99a3497842498c4fb9f259d22b95.jpg"><br><br>  <i>Quick reference</i> <br><br>  Although, in general, during the time elapsed since the announcement, the application proved to be quite effective, the conducted journalistic investigation recorded a number of ‚Äúgrowing pains‚Äù - problems with geotags, presence identification (the network periodically lost the user of the application, inviting him to go outside to take pictures), etc. Many drivers, before leaving the car for some time, remove or cover the license plate, which automatically reduces all the efforts of the Assistant users to a zero result. <br><br>  Certain problems with testing were also observed with ergonomics, or rather, the speed of processing the Assistant's algorithms - the first step is a photo of the state number of a possible intruder and sending it for analysis, the second is waiting for confirmation of the system that parking is not paid, the third is taking a photo from the door + Shooting a general video review of the car for at least 10 seconds.  Upon receipt of information, the inspector must wait 15 minutes before sending the notice of the detected intruder, after which, if the fact of payment during this time is not confirmed, send the data to the Processing Center. <br><br>  How the journalists shared the fact of the investigation, the daily raid ended in successfully sending all the required data in the right format to the six violators.  After a day, having received the system's report, the initiators were somewhat surprised, since only one of the six signals was useful.  The remaining five violators have already managed to compensate for the fine before the shooting. <br><br>  And one more news for the residents of the capital, who have not yet had time to appreciate the benefits of personal vehicles.  According to Liksutov, the development of a free application for land transport of the capital is nearing, which makes it possible to create routes, report the arrival times of buses and other urban transport. <br><br>  Well, I would like to wish our drivers never to fall under the lenses of those who want to join innovative technologies in this way, and active citizens will have fewer external reasons for their activity. <br><br>  <i><sub>If you wish, you can download the Moscow Helper by following the links below:</sub></i> <br><br>  <i><sub><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details%3Fid%3Dru.mos.helper%26hl%3Dru">for Android</a></sub></i> <br>  <i><sub><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/ru/app/pomosnik-moskvy/id1023672049%3Fmt%3D8">for iOS</a></sub></i> <br><br><hr><br>  Dear readers, we are always happy to meet and wait for you on the pages of our blog.
