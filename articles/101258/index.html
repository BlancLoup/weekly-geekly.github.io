  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Mobile operator LIFE and GSM \ GPS trackers</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img src="http://live.daemony.org/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/stop-life.png" alt="image"><br>  Recently, on Habr√©, I often notice topics related to various GSM / GPS trackers.  I have also been following these devices for a long time and even use them in everyday life.  Recently I installed a <a href="http://www.alans.org.ua/goods.php%3Fid%3D9363">GSM-GPS tracker</a> on my car.  The system worked for exactly three weeks and I was almost happy about it.  But yesterday there was a very unpleasant moment, I decided to send an SMS to my car in order to find out the coordinates of its position.  But within 10 minutes of the response SMS did not come, then I decided to call, to which I heard the familiar voice of the robot "This number is temporarily not served."  Strange, I thought, maybe some glitch?  This morning, I specifically went to the garage to check the system, tried to make another call, but the result was the same. <br>  Then I pulled out the SIM card and moved it to the phone, checking the balance, I suddenly found out that there was only 1 hryvnia in my account, although there should have been about 50 hryvnias.  And also in response to the USSD request, I did not see the usual line with the end date of the SIM card. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Then he tried to make an outgoing call, but he heard only one signal and silence, it was thought that the card had died from the intense heat, but it seemed to be registered on the network and answered USSD requests.  It was unbearably hot +41 in the shade, so it was decided to sort things out at home.  Having come home, I decided to top up the balance first!  Successfully replenished the account for 50 hryvnia, but you can not call again?  Strange ... I called the operator, answered as always a sweet female voice, I briefly described the problem to her.  The girl asked to stay on the line until she checks the information on my number.  After about a minute, she gave me the following phrase: ‚ÄúOur company recorded that you are using your SIM card in third-party equipment, such as tracking systems \ alerts, and if you refuse this idea, then go to any of our branch with your passport, there you will renew the number. "  I tried to clarify with the girl: ‚ÄúCan I not use my SIM card in the GSM tracker?‚Äù To which she affirmatively answered, ‚ÄúOf course not!‚Äù.  I tried to find information on this issue on the Internet and on the official website of the <a href="http://life.com.ua/">LIFE</a> operator, but did not find anything.  Question to habouiers, can someone come across this problem, what are the solutions, and is it really illegal to use the operator's sim card in such devices? <br><br>  In general, I was today at the office of Life.  Employees really could not explain anything to me :( <br>  I wrote a statement to explain in writing what clause in the agreement I violated and how they learned about it.  Also demanded to return the money that disappeared from the balance.  They promised to sort out and unlock the number.  We are waiting ... </div>
