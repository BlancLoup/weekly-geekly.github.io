  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Employment portals: an unexpected marketing tool</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Today I decided to talk about a rather non-standard topic.  Several times in my practice I have come across the fact that job search portals (HH, Superjob and others) can serve as very useful tools in marketing activities not at all for their intended purpose - job search or employees. <br><br>  Free (or completely inexpensive) we can get access to huge databases of companies or people who may be our potential customers, contractors, competitors.  What can be useful to extract from this data for yourself?  Let me try to list a few tricks that may be useful in the work. <br><br><h4>  Your service reference index: resumes / vacancies </h4><br>  If you are promoting a startup / service that people use for workflows (especially b2b), then one of the metrics reflecting the distribution efficiency of your product may be the number of references to it in the vacancy database and resume (for a certain period). 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>
        <script>
          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      The requirement (or wish) for knowing your product in the job description is a very useful metric that shows how popular your product is among your Central Asia and what its dynamics are.  The graph of the number of such references can serve as one of the KPI marketing (although, of course, not the main one). <br><br>  The same applies to the mention of your service in the resume of employees.  If your product is so good that the applicant indicates it in his application form, then possession of it is considered one of the competitive advantages.  This metric can serve as a good KPI for products, one of the elements of the strategy for which is the promotion of services ‚Äúfrom below‚Äù, orientation not only to decision makers, but also to ordinary employees. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Needless to say, no one will interfere with collecting exactly the same data for competitors, analyzing them depending on certain actions to develop functionality or change positioning.  In a sense, the collection of these data can serve as a ‚Äúlightweight analogue‚Äù of full-fledged research on the recognition of your brand and competitors among Central Asia (which, as a rule, cost a lot of money). <br><br>  Of course, such a metric will be quite useless for the agency business, but when the name of your studio / agency begins to appear in the job description of competitors: ‚Äú <i>Experience in XXX, YYY and ZZZ</i> is <i>preferable</i> ‚Äù is also a good sign. <br><br><h4>  Point of ‚Äúcold‚Äù entrance with an already initiated client need </h4><br>  Often, potential customer vacancies can serve as a good entry point for the initial appeal.  Constant monitoring of new vacancies for positions of interest to you (for example, vacancies of Internet projects manager on the client side - for web studios) will be able to expand the pool of ‚Äúwarm‚Äù customers who can offer their product or service. <br><br>  In addition to the sales themselves, you can actively recommend particularly interesting vacancies on the side of a potential client to your former employees and acquaintances - so you can get a loyal manager to you on the client side and, consequently, increase the likelihood of starting a collaboration. <br><br><h4>  Point catching owners and directors of SMB </h4><br>  A huge number of companies and agencies consider their business owners to be Central Organ.  The competition to reach such an audience is often very high, and there are not so many points of concentration of this Central Asian. <br><br>  If we talk about medium and small business, then often in such companies there is no dedicated role of the HR director and or manager, and directors and top management are directly involved in the selection of employees.  And this means that they themselves are looking for employees from the databases of job portals.  Thus, you can ‚Äúcatch‚Äù this audience by placing your ad in the personal offices of employers or in the search results of a resume. <br><br>  You can also try to catch the audience you need among applicants (for example, in your account or job search results) - for example, by promoting all sorts of educational things, training, professional literature, etc. <br><br><h4>  Virus Jobs </h4><br>  Often, a non-standard job or a job with a ‚Äúcreative‚Äù description can become a full-fledged virus on social networks, working to promote your brand.  I think everyone remembers the case on "The <a href="http://www.adme.ru/creativity/luchshaya-reklama-v-mire-nitro-54341/">best job in the world</a> ." <br>  You need to use this technique when you can tie a creative to real marketing benefits for your company, because a virus for the sake of a virus can do more harm and cost than good. <br><br><h4>  Competitive intelligence </h4><br>  Your competitor‚Äôs published vacancies can be a valuable source of information about their development plans.  For example, the published vacancy of the ‚Äúmobile application developer‚Äù speaks for itself, as well as the vacancies ‚Äúpartner manager with a knowledge of the realities of the Ukrainian market‚Äù, ‚Äúdirector of medical services‚Äù. <br>  These are simple options, it happens that the information you need is buried deeper.  Sometimes it is possible to extract it by simple letter / call with a request to clarify details on the described vacancy. <br><br><h4>  Contractor reliability analysis </h4><br>  If you want to start cooperation with a partner or contractor, about which you know not so much, again, job portals will be able to help you (however, of course, like social networks).  Find resumes of employees who have worked there before - make 5-6 calls, and after that much will become clear.  At the same time, of course, we must understand that the responses of former employees often have a certain bias in the negative direction - and make an amendment to this. <br><br>  Similarly, it is possible to assess the level of turnover in competing companies - by the dynamics and number of resumes appearing fast employees.  If a large rotation in the sales department where interns are recruited is not so important, but if the company ‚Äúran,‚Äù for example, project managers of high qualification is already a bell. <br><br><h4>  Conclusion </h4><br>  Of course, these are just a few examples that I personally encountered in practice.  I am sure that in fact there are much more of them - let's discuss this in the comments, offer your ‚Äúhodovka‚Äù. <br><br>  Sincerely, <i>Terekhov Andrey</i> <br><br>  <i>PS</i> By the way, we (Ruward) just yesterday announced the results <a href="http://www.ruward.ru/index-ruward/united-seo-rating-2013/index.html">of the 2013</a> ‚Äú <a href="http://www.ruward.ru/index-ruward/united-seo-rating-2013/index.html">Unified Rating of SEO Companies</a> ‚Äù.  At first I wanted to write about this, but then I decided that I would tell something useful better =) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/169961/">https://habr.com/ru/post/169961/</a></p>
