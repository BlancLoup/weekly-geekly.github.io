Being by nature a person rather consistent and balanced, I decided not to be carried out on colorful advertising, but to independently familiarize myself with all the widely used variants of content management systems ... <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  From the very beginning of the review, the task was defined - from among those presented on Runet today to consider the most popular and progressive CMS, focused on the creation of online stores.  However, for a number of my own considerations, I had a desire to work with the ‚Äúdomestic‚Äù product as it were.  Therefore, such CMS as magento, prestashop, opencart and the like were not taken into account by me. <br><br>  Accordingly, each of the engines considered, which took part in this review, had to meet a number of criteria.  The criteria themselves were selected on the basis of trends in technological development, on the one hand, and from the specifics of the work of such resources, on the other. <br><br>  So, the generated list of criteria is as follows:

Some articles have tutorials available for download. <br><br>  <b>Integration with 1C:</b> implemented at a good level; bidirectional data exchange with ‚Äú1C: Enterprise‚Äù is ensured due to the built-in standard means.  Supported starting from version 6.5. <br><br>  <b>Convenience of the admin panel:</b> It is worth noting the overall convenience of <b>the admin panel</b> , thoughtful placement of functional elements, as well as the ability to quickly transition between the back-end and the front-end.  Nevertheless, the level of intuitive perception seems low; a person without experience with this engine will obviously have to study documentation. <br><br>  <b>Easy to install (local server):</b> installation is easy, because the installer is used, and everything that is required to run on LAN is already built into the distribution, even the Open Server / Denver is simply not needed.  While browsing the information found on the Internet, the impression was that it is better not to install this engine outside the ‚Äúnative‚Äù web environment because of the high probability of difficulties.  Some basic settings (color scheme, menu view) are determined by the user already in the installation process. <br><br>  <b>Work with the goods: there is</b> nothing difficult, in fact, there is no product addition, but everything is rather complicated and the process consists of several steps.  According to the documentation, in order to be able to place goods in an appropriate way, it is necessary to carry out as many as 4 steps of settings and creation of information blocks. <br><br>  <b>Manage shipping and payment methods: the</b> appropriate module is built in, which must be properly configured before you begin.  Immediately do not have to look into the documentation. <br><br>  <b>Design templates:</b> on the developer‚Äôs website in the ‚ÄúMarketplace‚Äù section there are a lot of templates with the ability to be viewed in demo mode.  There are also a number of third-party resources that sell templates at various levels for this engine.  The cost of patterns for Bitrix ranges from $ 200 - $ 300 and up.  Among the templates you can find templates of different subjects and quality of execution.  What is remarkable is that you should not rush to the choice of a template in this case, since their pricing occurs in a slightly strange way - sometimes a better template on one side of the resource costs less than the template is clearly weaker on the other. <br><br>  <b>Roles of users: the</b> necessary functionality is thought out and present, but for effective use it is necessary to more thoroughly understand the mechanism of work with the study of documentation. <br><br>  <b>Demo version:</b> you can try both a demo version online and download a distribution kit for testing on a local computer.  The online demo is complete, but only 180 minutes is valid.  You can appreciate the convenience of the implementation of all major actions. <br><br>  <b>Import / export of goods:</b> data exchange is carried out using CSV files, but import and export are located in different menu items, which does not contribute to the ease of use of the system.  Without studying the instructions in the documentation will need to understand a long time. <br><br>  <b>SEO-optimization features:</b> metadata and keywords for an online store can be filled already at one of the installation stages.  SEO tools are collected in a separate section of settings.  You can specify the main settings associated with optimization (keyword, description, title and h2) for the main page, as well as for individual products.  But is it possible to make adjustments for the product category - after getting acquainted with this engine, it remains an open question for me ... There are also paid additions for SEO optimization costing from 950 rubles. <br><br>  There are also recommendations for correcting possible SEO errors on the page.  For each page, you can track conversions from search engines and referring sites.  True, it is not entirely clear why this is necessary in a world where Google Analytics and Yandex.Metrica already exist :) <br><br>  <b>System requirements:</b> according to the data from the official site - PHP 5.3 and higher, Apache 1.3 and higher or MS IIS 6.0 and higher, MySQL 5.0 and higher, eAccelerator 0.9.5.  Test hosting for compliance with technical requirements using a special script that is on the official site. <br><br>  <b>Flexibility of content management:</b> there is nothing complicated in creating new sections and pages, everything is done with the help of step-by-step wizards - from the formation of a URL to the registration of meta tags.  You can edit an existing page using a visual editor or in HTML format. <br><br>  <b>Extensibility of functionality:</b> in the Marketplace, hundreds of different modules are available from both the company and third-party developers.  Including a lot of free. <br><br>  <b>Export to Yandex.Market:</b> present. <br><br>  <b>Backup:</b> there is, you can schedule. <br><br>  <b>Caching:</b> embedded. <br><br>  <b>Personal account of the buyer:</b> in the personal account, the buyer can edit personal information and delivery profiles, manage the subscription and monitor their orders. <br><br>  <b>Support:</b> tickets, forum discussions, documentation. <br><br>  <b>Updates:</b> regularly, during the year after purchase, the user receives all updates for free. <br><br>  <b>The cost of versions:</b> edition with the functionality of an online store - ‚ÄúSmall Business‚Äù (27,900 rubles), ‚ÄúBusiness‚Äù (56,900 rubles). <br><br>  <b>User reviews:</b> according to user feedback, the advantage of CMS Bitrix is ‚Äã‚Äãthe ability to create high-load online stores and adapt the engine for a variety of needs.  Also worth noting is a very large number of modules in the Market.  Of the minuses - most of the modules are paid, the high cost of maintenance and development of additional components, the demands on server resources, the inflated price of the license, the internal quality of the code leaves much to be desired. <br><br>  <b>Overall impression:</b> this engine is a bit like a full-fledged operating system, and not just a CMS.  This has its pros and cons.  Of the benefits - integrity, extensive functionality and the ability to run the project directly from the box.  Disadvantages of Bitrix are cumbersome, demanding of server resources, high cost of rework and inaccessibility for mere mortals who are not privy to the secrets of development for this system. <br><br>  <i>Test speed online demo:</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f43/f89/89b/f43f8989b68ea6efe796008bab3d9da4.jpg"><br><br>  <i>Category page loading speed:</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/956/a80/b3f/956a80b3f777403cafa58092db4d67e5.jpg"><br><br>  <i>Product page loading speed:</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/fa9/c53/e46/fa9c53e46323436cfb2aab3b71561eb1.jpg"><br><br><h2>  NetCat CMS </h2><br>  <b>Developer Documentation:</b> Well structured, divided into articles for developers and ordinary users who administer the site.  In addition to a simple description of one or another functional, there are lessons for various categories of users (administrator, designer, developer), video tutorials, as well as the ability to download the system manual in PDF format. <br><br>  <b>Integration with 1C:</b> Starting with version 3.5, the ability to work with 1C is implemented.  The latest version of NetCat 5.4 supports data exchange with 1C 7th and 8th versions. <br><br>  <b>Convenience of the admin panel:</b> admin and unusual and non-standard, though after a while you can get used to.  Navigating through the content is also hardly convenient, although it may be the result of the same non-standard approach to the implementation of the administrative part.  When working with NetCat, obviously, one of the tabs will have to keep several pages of documentation constantly open. <br><br>  <b>Easy to install (local server):</b> there were no problems with the installation on OpenServer, the whole process took about a minute of time. <br><br>  <b>Work with the goods:</b> there are both pluses and minuses.  The advantages include the compactness of the location of the necessary elements and the relative ease of creating a product card.  But the disadvantages include all the same compactness (sometimes excessive), the general intricacy of the process of creating a new section in the catalog and a commodity card. <br><br>  <b>Management of delivery and payment methods:</b> starting from version 5.3, management of payment methods is carried out through the module "Acceptance of payments".  There is nothing difficult in mastering; you can connect all popular payment systems. <br>  Delivery management is carried out through the Delivery menu item, which is also quite simple to work with. <br><br>  <b>Design Templates: There were no</b> ready-made or available templates for downloading or purchasing on the official website. <br><br>  <b>User roles:</b> the process of adding a new user is simple and straightforward, but the function of assigning rights is rather confused. <br><br>  <b>Demo: An</b> online demo is available, as well as the ability to download the distribution for testing on a local server. <br><br>  <b>Import / export of goods:</b> in addition to data exchange with 1C, data import / export is also available in CSV or XLS files. <br><br>  <b>SEO-optimization features:</b> for each page you can write a title, keywords and meta description, add or delete a page in sitemap.xml, set the priority of its indexing.  To do this, go to the desired page and select the item ‚ÄúSEO‚Äù in the settings. <br><br>  <b>System requirements:</b> Apache 1.3.30 and higher, PHP 5.2 and higher, MySQL 4.1, 64 MB of RAM (128 recommended). <br><br>  <b>Content Management Flexibility: You</b> can add sections, subsections, pages, and individual products.  In general, everything is convenient, but if the user is used to the standard type of admin panel, which is used in most CMS, then you can not immediately understand how to add this or that content element.  Nevertheless, to figure out what is what can be pretty quickly. <br><br>  <b>Extensibility of functionality: the</b> number of modules available on the site depends on the edition of the system used.  In a special section CatStore on off.  Site available components from third-party developers.  They are few, about a hundred, but most are free. <br><br>  <b>Export to Yandex.Market:</b> present. <br><br>  <b>Backup:</b> yes. <br><br>  <b>Caching:</b> embedded. <br><br>  <b>Personal account of the buyer:</b> is in all editions of the system. <br><br>  <b>Support:</b> tickets, documentation. <br><br>  <b>Updates:</b> come out about once every six months, and each one is made quite a large number of changes and corrections.  You can upgrade to the current version through your personal account. <br><br>  <b>Cost of versions:</b> components of the online store are available in versions of E-commerce (28,900 rubles) and Extra (34,900 rubles). <br><br>  <b>User reviews:</b> if you analyze reviews, the advantages of NetCat include ease of management of the majority of users, good technical support, a flexible system of modules and components.  Among the shortcomings - the complexity of refinement, if there is no experience with this engine, weak documentation. <br><br>  <b>Overall impression:</b> after working with NetCat, this CMS left an impression of a functional and modern tool, flexible in settings, in which there is nothing superfluous.  At the same time, this engine seems a bit ‚Äúgeeky‚Äù, going beyond the usual framework, and, accordingly, it will take time to get used to it. <br><br>  Judging by the amount of background information on the official website, for an effective work, the site owner managed by NetCat will have to be well acquainted with the documentation. <br><br>  <i>Test speed online demo:</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/336/be5/532/336be5532eab4eaf9133caa77dd51459.jpg"><br><br>  <i>Category page loading speed:</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/1cf/1e0/760/1cf1e076043868df86e412535dd73923.jpg"><br><br>  <i>Product page loading speed:</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/5cd/05c/43a/5cd05c43a45d9defbd4f5ea76b18106a.jpg"><br><br><h2>  UMI.CMS </h2><br><br>  <b>Developer Documentation:</b> Available in the form of training video articles and download files.  The documentation is structured and divided by user roles, although it has a slightly confusing look. <br><br>  <b>Integration with 1C:</b> UMI.CMS provides for integration with 1C, starting with version 2.8.  To integrate the current version 2.9.6, you must use "1C: Enterprise" version 8.1 or 8.2, "1C: Trade Management" is not lower than version 10.3.4. <br><br>  <b>Convenience of the admin panel:</b> well-organized functionality - almost no extra clicks.  In general, the admin panel is easy to manage and convenient, and I also liked the navigation.  But the design of the admin panel looks obviously outdated, it is difficult to call it modern. <br><br>  <b>Easy to install (local server): it</b> is easy to install, the distribution kit is unpacked using its own installer.  The whole process includes 9 steps, but before that it is recommended to read the readme file that comes with it. <br><br>  <b>Work with the goods: the</b> addition of goods, editing and management of commodity cards is implemented quite conveniently and does not cause any problems. <br><br>  <b>Managing delivery and payment methods:</b> via the Online Store module.  The processes of creating and managing payment and delivery are also pretty well thought out. <br><br>  <b>Design templates:</b> on the developer‚Äôs website there are about two hundred ready-made templates for online stores of fairly good quality.  However, this mass character also has a reverse side - the templates are of the same type and, if you do not take into account the images, they do not differ much from each other.  Templates are available as part of the Commerce edition, the value of 29900 rubles. <br><br>  <b>Roles of users:</b> with the help of the "Users" module there is the possibility of creating certain groups of users and giving them the corresponding rights. <br><br>  <b>Demo version:</b> you can work with the engine either through a full-fledged online demopanel or by downloading a distribution kit for testing on a local server. <br><br>  <b>Import / export of goods:</b> carried out using the module "Data Exchange", the main format are CSV-files. <br><br>  <b>SEO optimization</b> features <b>:</b> supports Yandex.Webmaster integration.  Editing meta tags of a separate page and section is carried out through the advanced fields or the admin toolbar. <br><br>  <b>System requirements:</b> Apache with the mod_rewrite and mod_auth modules installed and connected, PHP version 5.3 and above, MySQL version 5 and above (with support for InnoDB), RAM - from 64 MB. <br><br>  <b>Content management flexibility:</b> creating and editing new pages is easy, but a bit inconvenient compared to other engines, although the tree structure of the site allows you to quickly navigate.  It is worth noting an interesting feature: it is possible to edit the content in a visual form (Edit-in-place), while on the site, for which it is enough to press F2, logging in under the administrator account.  All changes made in this way can be saved immediately. <br><br>  <b>Extensibility of the functional:</b> there are 26 modules, the available number of which depends on the purchased edition of the system.  If necessary, you can buy additional modules separately.  I did not find a module store from third-party developers, so most likely additional components will need to be ordered from developers on the side. <br><br>  <b>Export to Yandex.Market:</b> export to YML is configured through a special module. <br><br>  <b>Backup:</b> yes. <br><br>  <b>Caching:</b> built-in, several types available. <br><br>  <b>Personal account of the buyer:</b> is. <br><br>  <b>Support:</b> tickets, documentation, forum. <br><br>  <b>Updates:</b> releases every 2 - 4 months, come out regularly. <br><br>  <b>The cost of versions: the</b> online store can be launched on the basis of the editions of Shop (19,900 rubles) and Commerce (29,900 rubles). <br><br>  <b>User reviews: the</b> positive aspects of the engine are convenient content management, well-developed documentation, the ability to work in the mode of visual editing, reasonable prices.  Of the minuses - the complexity of refinement and problems in finding third-party experts, the bulkiness of the system as a whole. <br><br>  <b>Overall impression:</b> this engine is one of the first and most popular in the markets, which, accordingly, suggests a well-thought-out functionality.  It can be seen that the developers are constantly working to improve the system - for example, even a mobile application is available for owners of online stores. <br><br>  However, it seems that the age of the system led to the appearance of its minuses.  For example, the admin panel seemed outdated to me, it would be nice to make its redesign.  And many programmers complain about the engine's intricate code. <br><br>  <i>Test speed online demo:</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f92/6a1/85d/f926a185d442c7eef412087558fa03c3.jpg"><br><br>  <i>Category page loading speed:</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/65d/48a/676/65d48a6766d4f752364f382de4c6f67d.jpg"><br><br>  <i>Product page loading speed:</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e84/f7d/69d/e84f7d69d85998bca11eaa2f6b527fbe.jpg"><br><br><h2>  Host CMS </h2><br><br>  <b>Developer Documentation:</b> Available in the form of archives and PDF-files for download, there are also video tutorials on the robot with Hostcms and a general guide for developers.  The existing documentation is clearly not enough, and in the event of a petty problem, to solve it, you will most likely have to shovel mountains of information on the forum to find a solution. <br><br>  <b>Integration with 1C:</b> you can import and export a catalog of goods and product offers from 1C: Trade Management 8.x, in CommerceML v.  1.xx, 2.0x or CSV. <br><br>  <b>Convenience admin panel:</b> usability and ease of use leave much to be desired.  The main remark here can be considered the ill-conceived structure of the placement of functional elements on the main panel, some of which are actually duplicated in their meaningful purpose or belong to the category of "very necessary" functionality.  For the unprepared user, its intuitive perception raises a number of big doubts and questions. <br><br>  <b>Ease of installation (local server):</b> Of the three attempts to install this engine on a local server, none were successful.  And before that, I even watched the installation video posted on the developers site.

Moreover, the imported file is converted by the system to CSV automatically. <br><br>  <b>SEO optimization</b> opportunities <b>:</b> there are opportunities for SEO optimization of the online store as a whole, including such content items as categories, pages and individual product cards.  Separately, it is worth noting the module SEO expert, which allows you to customize the display of meta tags in many ways for categories, brands and products in general, and for specific, selected by the user. <br><br>  <b>System requirements:</b> PHP 5.4 and above, MySQL 4.1 and above, enabled mod_rewrite, RAM 256 MB and above, PHP modules: json, mbstring, curl, pdo_mysql. <br><br>  <b>Content Management Flexibility: You</b> can add and edit various elements, such as pages, categories, product cards, etc.  - simple and clear. <br><br>  <b>Extensibility of functionality:</b> almost three dozen built-in modules are available.  There is an add-ons shop, but the number of modules available there is small.  However, the situation is the same with all engines except Beatrix. <br><br>  <b>Import to Yandex.Market:</b> is. <br><br>  <b>Backup:</b> yes. <br><br>  <b>Caching:</b> embedded. <br><br>  <b>Personal account of the buyer:</b> is. <br><br>  <b>Support:</b> ticket system, forum, documentation. <br><br>  <b>Updates:</b> regularly, every one and a half to two months.  All updates are free. <br><br>  <b>Version cost:</b> ImageCMS Shop Professional Edition ($ 349) and Premium ($ 599). <br><br>  <b>User reviews:</b> users note such advantages as convenient management, wide functionality ‚Äúfrom the box‚Äù, undemanding hosting, well-developed documentation and good opportunities for SEO-optimization.  The disadvantages, judging by the reviews, are the small number of templates available and the long responses from technical support. <br><br>  <b>Overall impression:</b> in general, the system left a pleasant impression - the management is clear, the admin panel is nice, there is more than enough documentation.  It can be seen that the developers are actively working on the engine, although the community is not yet quite large.  About two dozen template designs are available, but all have a completely modern look, so the emphasis is on quality, not quantity. <br><br>  <i>Test speed online demo:</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/bd8/ebf/a77/bd8ebfa7701d973b6912e1900d6a3dab.jpg"><br><br>  <i>Category page loading speed:</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/92d/40a/045/92d40a04599b51dc6e67268a157e0426.jpg"><br><br>  <i>Product page loading speed:</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f7e/f87/43f/f7ef8743fc9eadbfde1a6c2b6b0eb6ee.jpg"><br><br>  So it is time to draw conclusions from this review engines.  What I can say objectively is that of the content management systems I have considered for online stores, it is hardly possible to unambiguously highlight the best product, since each engine has its own specific strengths and weaknesses.  At this point, engine developers are trying to create a product that combines convenience, simplicity, lightness and functionality.  While this task is not given to everyone and not in full, but with each version of the CMS, the goal is getting closer. <br><br>  As for my general conclusions, they are approximately as follows: not necessarily the more popular engines are the best, but the less popular ones are the worst.  In this direction, growth and development are clearly observed in a more or less equal competition.  Such a state of things can lead to a certain qualitative breakthrough in the near future. <br><br>  After the completion of the review, I personally selected a couple of leaders from the general list, so I couldn‚Äôt make my own choices.  I do not know how correct it will be on my part, so that no one would consider me an advertiser and agitator, to name which CMS I gave the advantage to.  Still, Amiro, ImageCMS and UMI-CMS are in my top three.  Who is the first, who is the last in my top three - I'm sorry, I will not say.  I will only add that I prefer to do everything myself and do not plan to spend long hours studying the ‚Äúextra‚Äù documentation or involve third-party people to work at my store, of course, except for designers and freelancers, whose services I most likely need in the future ... Therefore, the key criteria for me were general simplicity, ease of operation and the same intuitive clarity of the admin. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/231097/">https://habr.com/ru/post/231097/</a></p>
