We found out that the most popular companies in Moscow are Yandex and Mail.ru, and in St. Petersburg - JetBrains and Yandex.  On the other leaders of the rating can be found in our <a href="https://habr.com/ru/company/moikrug/blog/342258/">previous study</a> . <br><br>  At the end of 2018, we decided to repeat the study and find out from IT specialists - users of ‚ÄúHabra‚Äù and ‚ÄúMy Circle‚Äù - what they think about the largest companies represented in Moscow and St. Petersburg. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The IT market in the two capitals is very saturated, we could not include all companies in the survey.  When selecting, we took into account the availability of office, company size, DevRel-activity and other parameters.

      First, let's say a few words about the research audience.  More than 1,000 people took part in the survey, of which 68% are in Moscow and 32% are in St. Petersburg.  They have programming experience - 74.5% of respondents. <br><br>  <b>Specialization and age of respondents</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/tl/d3/uc/tld3ucviegwgju9npns8ejpvv8w.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Almost 60% of respondents are developers, 75% of respondents are in the range of 22 - 35 years. <br><br>  <b>Respondent Experience and Programming Languages</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ek/hz/aw/ekhzawwunyt3dlkrfbqklorinhg.png" alt="image"><br><br>  60% of respondents have programming experience of more than 2 years.  The main languages ‚Äã‚Äãthat they use in their work: JavaScript, Python, Java, PHP, C #. <br><br>  In the first part of the study, we asked general questions about the popularity and popularity of companies. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/rt/5c/gr/rt5cgrm0rx7krb5fvubtq3hd_s0.png" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/cv/cq/3m/cvcq3m-ecc2dh6fr0wyilxjxfu4.png" alt="image"><br><br>  In St. Petersburg, Yandex is the leader, with JetBrains in second place (you can even say that two companies share first place).  Vkontakte is in the third place, the fourth is divided between Wargaming, EPAM, SberTech, Kaspersky Lab and Mail.ru. <br><br>  In Moscow, Yandex is well ahead of all companies, and no one disputes its first place here.  The second place belongs to Mail.ru Group, the third is taken by Avito, the fourth - by Tinkov, Kaspersky Lab, Badoo and SberTech. <br><br>  We see that, in general, the graphics data about the companies in which they want to work coincide with the data about the best companies: the respondents want to work in those companies that they consider to be the best.  However, there are a couple of interesting moments. <br><br>  In St. Petersburg, EPAM confidently occupies the fourth position among the best companies of the city, but at the same time they are ready to work there with the same probability as in other companies that are not in the top three and who are in fourth place. <br><br>  In Moscow, a similar situation with the Kaspersky Lab.  This company along with Avito confidently occupies the fourth position among the best companies.  But when it comes to the willingness to work there, she is no longer distinguished from those who are not included in the top three. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/mi/jh/jb/mijhjbq03hpqxmorgfbfbrharni.png" alt="image"><br><br>  In this question, you could choose any number of answers.  In St. Petersburg, 90% of developers are aware of the activities of the TOP-3 companies, more than 60% of respondents are aware of the activities of 10 leading companies, and in Moscow almost 90% of respondents are aware of the activities of TOP-3 companies, but the situation with the other companies in the list is slightly worse. <br><br>  In the second part, we wanted to explore the tools that companies use to engage developers. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/gp/sp/jz/gpspjz6chuiwcvgyt_s8subkbh8.png" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/wu/6o/ud/wu6oudgm2lvynxg9gcsfpbdrx1k.png" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/0l/_f/bd/0l_fbdgnprrtvnvatgrtmkz6vaa.png" alt="image"><br><br>  We see a curious correlation of these graphs with the previous ones.  Top of the best companies in the city correlates with the top of the companies where they hold interesting events or whose developers make interesting reports.  And the top companies in which they want to work most of all are with the top companies in which development tasks seem to be the most interesting. <br><br>  The graphs show that Yandex is the leader in events and reports in St. Petersburg, JetBrains is in second place, EPAM is in third place, and Mail.ru and VKontakte are in fourth place.  In Moscow, Yandex ranks first with a significant margin from other companies, Mail.ru Group is second, Avito, Kaspersky Lab and Tinkov are third. <br><br>  But again, there are a number of interesting and notable exceptions. <br><br>  In St. Petersburg, EPAM's development tasks do not seem as interesting as those of other companies that are not in the top 3. But at the same time, they want to work here a little more often than in companies with more interesting tasks.  Most likely, this company offers some additional motivators that our research does not know about.  And this is unlikely to be associated only with interesting events and reports. <br><br>  Moscow has a similar situation with Avito: people want to work here more often than in some companies that are not in the top 3, but whose tasks seem more interesting to developers.  And again, the point here is not that Avito is doing more interesting activities: Kaspersky Lab performs on an equal footing. <br><br><hr><br>  PS My Circle also has a <a href="https://habr.com/ru/company/moikrug/blog/417611/">company valuation service</a> , where current and former employees of the company can evaluate it by 12 criteria.  It is interesting to compare how the company is evaluated by employees who know the company from the inside and those who do not work in the company.  In our <a href="https://habr.com/ru/company/moikrug/blog/432904/">2018 ranking,</a> Yandex wins in the following categories: ‚Äú <i>Interesting tasks</i> ‚Äù, ‚Äú <i>Professional growth</i> ‚Äù, ‚Äú <i>Social package</i> ‚Äù, ‚Äú <i>Comfortable working conditions</i> ‚Äù and ‚Äú <i>The company makes the world a better place</i> ‚Äù.  Mail.ru - in the nominations " <i>Adequate Salary</i> ", " <i>Social Package</i> " and " <i>Comfortable working conditions</i> ".  JetBrains - in the nominations ‚Äú <i>Adequate Salary</i> ‚Äù, ‚Äú <i>Comfortable working conditions</i> ‚Äù and ‚Äú <i>The Company makes the world better</i> ‚Äù.
