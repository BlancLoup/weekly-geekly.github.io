  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Socialization coefficient. Practical use</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  In a <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blog/socset/37304.html">previous post</a> I reviewed the basic concept of the <em>coefficient of socialization</em> .  We found out that this coefficient can be an excellent indicator of the person‚Äôs integration into the social network.  But we have not considered how the COP can be applied in practice. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h3>  Analytics </h3><br>  Based on the components of the coefficient of socialization, it can be judged that this value can be both analytical and practical. <br><br>  The analytical part of the COP is expressed in the fact that, for clarity, we can (at the request of the user or on our own) estimate the degree of his <em>socialization</em> .  To do this, we, of course, will need user assistance, since often the data of CS indicators are personal (for example, relationships with individuals from the contact list, use of services with a narrow thematic focus, etc.). 
      <br>

      The assessment of the degree of socialization can be started by calculating the indexation of a person and the level of her citation on the Internet.  This is done with the help of search engines (and one search engine is indispensable here, since each of them indexes different masses of documents in the network).  This indicator is very significant in relation to the entire COP, as it reflects the public opinion on the person for whom the coefficient of socialization is calculated.  Analysis of the indexing should be done mechanically (with the help of an operator who will make queries to the search engine).  When using a search engine, you need to cover the maximum possible number of queries with different variations of user personalization: nickname, first name, surname, and so on.  That is why you should use the mechanical processing of the results of the issue: there is a very large number of collisions between different users of the network. <br><br>  This part of the study allows you to look at the user from different angles.  The public is able to soberly assess his skills, abilities, character, professional qualities, mental abilities.  First of all, it will help to create a psychological portrait of the respondent, sociability, which is very often one of the factors in employment. <br><br>  After conducting such an analysis, you need to consider the personal information provided by the user: his resume, questionnaire, all sorts of testing.  Immediately, it becomes possible to compare the data submitted by the respondent and the data obtained as a result of the analysis of person indexation, which will help to assess the user's internal self-consciousness. <br><br>  Such data is immediately supported by profiling: the user's personal data (gender, age, personal interests, etc.) are taken into account, which complement his professional and psychological portraits. <br><br>  In addition, there is an assessment of the user's relationship with their friends and colleagues.  This compares with the coverage of messaging services and contacts.  Such an assessment can be either automatic (analysis of the semantic contact graph of the user, XFN, evaluation of the contact list of the user), and mechanical (analysis of the respondent‚Äôs colleagues and friends, as one of the preferred options). <br><br>  The most recent stage involves viewing the narrowly focused thematic social networks visited by the respondent in order to identify his direct interests. <br><br>  Such analytical data can be successfully used in practice. <br><br><h3>  Personnel issue </h3><br>  As mentioned above, even a study of 75% of the indicators of the COP allows you to create a user profile on a social network.  Calculating the CS can help the employer in hiring a potential employee for one of the vacancies: at the interview, the respondent indicates the data necessary for the analysis, which the operator uses to calculate the CS (if desired, the respondent, of course).  This indicator can later be used as one of the factors of employment, because it is obvious that, with a negative level of the COP (and therefore, with the socialized nature of the potential employee), there is some risk that the current environment and working conditions in the company and the potential employee repel each other.  Even the measurement of person indexing and quoting can say a lot about the future employee.  Why hire an absolutely uncommunicative person who got negative indexes on social networks? <br><br>  But such indicators can be used not only in the personnel department.  It is possible to be guided by the COP when creating a favorable, <em>individual</em> atmosphere for each employee of the company.  The usual analysis of the visited narrowly focused thematic networks allows to determine the circle of interests of the employee and can help in revising the attitude towards him.  You can go further and erase the line between the Internet and everyday life: if a person (at the global level of analysis) is respected on the Internet, then they will respect him as a team, because very often the differences in human behavior on the Internet and everyday life are minimized (except when the person himself wants it for some reason).  Therefore, using the indicators of the COP, you can identify and highlight the individual parts of the operating mechanism of the company. <br><br><h3>  Social networks </h3><br>  Despite the fact that social networks themselves are one of the sources for calculating the CS, they can also use it. <br><br>  As an example, we can consider the mechanisms of regulation embedded in a social network (rating values).  They can be used both externally (to calculate the CS itself) and internally (to regulate the relationships within the social network, as well as to provide the necessary functionality in accordance with indicators of rating values).  For this, the algorithms for calculating such quantities should be constructed so that the social factor is fundamental. <br><br>  If you look from a bird's-eye view, then we will see a network of social networks.  In such a network, you can use the CS for official communication between the nodes of such a huge network.  This value (CS) will be transferred from one social network to another, or stored centrally, in a permanent data repository.  This method of calculating the COP will measure the attitudes of users of various social networks (decentralized) to one user.  The current development of the social network is such a mechanism of decentralization as OpenID.  So, by improving it to such a level that it can store (and synchronize) rating values ‚Äã‚Äãbetween different OpenID servers, it is possible to achieve the effect of load balancing the socialization coefficient across different social networks. <br><br>  Direct use of the COP is expressed primarily in the fact that the user does not have to look for the network that is right for him.  Social networks will find it themselves.  Therefore, it can be concluded that narrowly focused thematic social networks will gradually crowd out wide social networks.  Such newly appeared networks will find their users, taking into account their COP, its profiling, interests, and so on.  Such social networks will be really aimed at personalization of users of social networks. <br><br><h3>  Advertising </h3><br>  Advertising is one of the most complicated processes, since one has to take into account huge audiences of users who usually have very fragmented interests. <br><br>  The COP in this case can play the role of a kind of guide.  For example, you can take the usual advertising shows on any site.  If this site knows the coefficient of socialization of the current visitor, then he can choose advertisements for him much more clearly.  It will take into account the psychological characteristics of the user, and his professional orientation (Web-development - advertising about tools and innovations in the field of website development, as an example). <br><br>  But on the other hand, using the KS indicator - rating values ‚Äã‚Äã- you can build a service where users themselves will talk about their tastes, evaluate this or that advertisement, and advertisers will later use this advertisement as an advertisement that went through user sifting.  Each user in this service will show ads in accordance with his COP, which he will evaluate.  In accordance with its assessment, various adjustments to the CS own level are possible. <br><br>  Since the COP is transmitted to the social network, the entire space of this concept, the user will receive only the advertisement corresponding to the level of his COP. <br><br><h3>  Personal Optimization </h3><br>  Interestingly, by comparing data on the user's time on the Internet and his CS, you can determine the dependence of the CS change on time and build a graph that will show us how quickly this value has changed over time, determine its corrections and peaks, which will help us find out which events led to big changes in the COP and draw certain conclusions from this. <br><br>  The use of such data suggests the following idea: by analyzing your own CS level, a person can learn from his own mistakes and henceforth do not commit them anymore.  Obviously, for example, that the apparent rudeness and unworthy behavior on any resource will lead to an undoubted decrease in the COP.  And if a large number of other services are tied to this value, the user will think next time before speaking sharply about something, because it can cost him quite a lot (one of the options: the user‚Äôs account on social networks A and B. With inadequate user behavior in social network A, this may directly affect social network B, up to excluding the user from one of the social networks, or from both). <br><br><h3>  Results </h3><br>  We considered several ways of practical application of the coefficient of socialization.  The CC got into areas such as marketing research, personnel research, and simple analytics.  KS can be used not only as an indicator of integration into a network of social networks, but also to apply it when calculating other values. <br><br>  In the following articles, it will be possible to elaborate on practical application in more detail: at least mechanically calculate the CS of several people I can, and I will try to do it (maybe I will also attract volunteers). <br><br></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/23499/">https://habr.com/ru/post/23499/</a></p>
