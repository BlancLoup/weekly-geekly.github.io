It should be noted that now there are many cloud telephony services, offering, also, the basic functionality of CRM.  On the other hand, many CRM manufacturers are trying to integrate basic telephony functions directly into the user interface.  There are also ready-made ‚Äútwo-in-one‚Äù systems, in which communication capabilities were laid during the design. <br><br>  In short, the manufacturers of these solutions have heard the demands of the users and are moving in the right direction.  In general, the way it is.  However, the ‚Äútwo-in-one‚Äù approach has a number of disadvantages, the most important of which is unsatisfactory flexibility.  Agree, the creation of a functional system of unified communications and first-class CRM requires completely different competencies.  As a result, the user is faced with either limited communication capabilities, or a useless ‚Äúcut off‚Äù CRM with unclear prospects for development. <br><br>  In systems where CRM is initially combined with telephony, there are also a number of disadvantages: <a name="habracut"></a>

    <ul><li>  Often, the user cannot connect his equipment, especially SIP gateways and trunks from the operators he needs.  Manufacturer CRM provides its own SIP trunks with inflated rates. </li><li>  The stability of the telephony in such integrated systems is often a criticism, because it is not the main direction of development of the system. </li><li>  Very limited user settings, which are usually reduced to the simplest setting of statuses.  Ability to specify more complex call processing rules is missing. </li><li>  The functionality of the Call Queues and the call center is generally very limited.  The reason is the same - this is not the main priority, since  Immediately a lot of priorities. </li><li>  Limited performance and telephony extensibility. </li><li>  Limited work in distributed and multi-branch networks. </li><li>  Controversial price / performance ratio, especially in terms of opportunities. </li></ul><br>  Perhaps an all-in-one solution makes it impossible for a company to choose.  By combining communications and CRM in one system, you, in fact, will forever remain attached to it, and you will have to put up with all its shortcomings.  After all, these are two key technologies of your business.  Popular wisdom says - do not put all your eggs in one basket!  And one more thing - as was said, it is very difficult to equally well develop completely different technologies (telephony and CRM) in one product.  It is unlikely that the company will be able to bring together the best VoIP and CRM developers in one team.  And if they can, then the cost of the finished product you do not like.  As a result of this ‚Äúunified‚Äù approach, you get some averaged (or simplified) capabilities of both communications and CRM. <br><br>  Compare 3-in-1 coffee drink from a bag and deliciously brewed natural coffee of your favorite variety, with the right amount of good milk and other ingredients that you like.  Wouldn't it be better to have flexible telephony from recognized professionals and, separately, the most suitable CRM for you? <br><br>  3CX offers exactly this approach.  Having developed an inexpensive and well-proven unified communications platform, we made it open for integration with any information system - using a standard API! <br><br>  If you want to integrate the CRM you need with 3CX v15, first of all, pay attention to the <a href="http://www.3cx.com/crm-integration/">list of already supported CRM</a> .  If 3CX CRM integration is not implemented for your system, you can quickly and easily create your own integration plugin using the <a href="https://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/c9757015-d7ab-4d56-aa28-0c3d985f8b1b">3CX Visual Studio Plugin Template</a> .  This template will generate all the necessary integration code. <br><br>  If you do not have a developer, fill out the <a href="http://www.3cx.com/crm-integration/crm-integration-suggestion-form/">request for the development of CRM integration</a> on our website, and we will consider the possibility of implementing the integration by our resources. <br><br>  The 3CX Visual Studio Plugin Template includes a setup wizard, which specifies the type of authentication, type of web service and URL needed to develop the plugin.  After specifying these parameters, the setup wizard will generate an integration code.  You can use integration code with minimal changes to connect to your CRM. <br><br>  The template supports the following authentication types: <br><br><ul><li>  No Authentication </li><li>  <a href="http://www.3cx.com/docs/basic-authentication/">Basic Authentication</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://www.3cx.com/docs/oauth2-authentication/">OAuth2 Authentication</a> </li></ul><br>  The following CRM web service APIs are supported: <br><br><ul><li>  REST </li><li>  SOAP </li></ul><br>  <strong>The whole process of creating a plugin takes less than one working day!</strong> <br><br><ul><li>  Detailed instructions for creating a plugin is <a href="http://www.3cx.com/docs/crm-integration/">here</a> . </li><li>  You can discuss issues of integration and automation in a <a href="http://www.3cx.com/forums/app-integration-automation-f27.html">special forum</a> . </li></ul><br><h2>  Integration of 3CX Phone System Pro with Freshdesk CRM and Nutshell CRM customer support system </h2><br>  We are working to create the largest possible number of ready-made CRM integrations that our users can simply download and use for free.  Note that all integrations are open source, which you can modify by adding the necessary functionality! <br><br>  And now we are introducing new 3CX Phone System Pro integration plugins with the Freshdesk CRM and Nutshell CRM customer support system. <br>  Plugins provide the following features: <br><br><ul><li>  Click to Call - calls for a click on the client number in CRM.  Calls are made by 3CX Client or supported IP phone </li><li>  Call Pop-up - client's card in CRM automatically opens upon an incoming call </li><li>  If the caller's number is not found, the system creates a new contact in CRM </li><li>  Call Journal - all calls are recorded in the CRM call log </li></ul><br>  New plug-ins are located in the <strong>Updates</strong> section of the 3CX management interface.  Integration is included individually for each user. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d23/e12/249/d23e12249b6298acbccdb8af8f7ae0c7.png"><br><br><ul><li>  To integrate 3CX and Freshdesk, read <a href="http://www.3cx.com/docs/freshdesk-crm-integration/">this guide</a> . </li><li>  To successfully integrate 3CX and Nutshell, read <a href="http://www.3cx.com/docs/nutshell-crm-pbx-integration/">this guide</a> . </li></ul><br>  We also recommend that you familiarize yourself with the list of <a href="http://www.3cx.com/crm-integration/">other CRM systems</a> for which integration has already been implemented. <br><br>  <strong>Important:</strong> CRM integration is implemented only in the 3CX Phone System Professional edition! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/307270/">https://habr.com/ru/post/307270/</a></p>
