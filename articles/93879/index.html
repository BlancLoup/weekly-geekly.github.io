  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Emotional Leadership</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  During the search for literature about motivation, this book - ‚ÄúEmotional Leadership‚Äù - came into my hands.  (Daniel Goleman, Richard Boyacis, Annie Mackey) <br>  It is written by people who are engaged in the study of various management techniques, and of course advice, training and other things. <br>  As one would expect, a decent volume of the book is devoted to ideas, the introduction of which the authors actually do.  Where there is really a positive experience of application, and where marketing is sometimes difficult to figure out.  In general, the whole book is written in my opinion in a very advertising language, which makes reading for a technical person not an easy task.  The brain is very painfully trained to remove marketing glitters and other decorations from the text that hide the true meaning of what has been written.  But in general, the density of information is very good.  I even reread some chapters.  I could not immediately understand all the logical chains. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  The main benefit of the book is the authors' understanding of the problem of motivating people to work.  The problem of spherical motivation in a vacuum, which many modern companies suffer, which consider that a person wants to work well, is something that goes without saying, is not quite badly written.  Similarly, it is shown how the interests of employees can drastically diverge from the interests of the company, and that it is very dangerous for top management to score on such.  It is shown that with proper personnel management the risk of such situations can be significantly reduced.  Examples are given of fairly slippery in terms of the motivations of an honest person, types of business, like advertising. <br><br>  The book itself is divided into three parts. <br>  The first one tells what emotional intelligence is and how it relates to leadership styles.  Further, what is resonance in communication and explains why it is good.  Describes the techniques that in certain situations can be used to achieve the goals set before the leader.  It also describes aggressive management styles, which are based on the suppression of communication, describes their zone of applicability, although it is felt that the authors clearly do not like these styles.  The problem of information noise that surrounds any boss who speaks to subordinate courtiers or simply doesn‚Äôt like bad news is pretty well described.  The problems of such people are shown in self-esteem and in the fact that it is almost always inadequate, with all the ensuing problems in management, based on a misunderstanding of the situation as a whole, and of its role in what is happening.

      In the second part there is a discussion of how to learn the correct, from the point of view of the authors, management techniques.  On the whole, a very correct idea was expressed that everyone who already has management experience should, at the beginning, develop to a good level those styles that he already instinctively uses, and then master adjacent ones.  It is explained that management styles are associated with character traits and that an intelligent person uses what is well supported at the level of his character, because  then everything turns out to be sincere, which is important when managing strong employees who are extremely dangerous to cheat.  The problem of internal motivation of a person when learning is revealed, i.e.  it is shown that it is simply useless to learn the methodology, that it is necessary for the trainees themselves to understand that the old management method is not very effective. <br><br>  In the third part there is a story about building climate in the organization as a whole.  Those.  applications of these techniques are already at the level of large divisions.  It shows the difference in motivation to change at the level of the individual and at the level of a group of people.  It shows what difficulties usually arise when trying to change leadership style, what dangers pose in the top-down programs, without the real support of ordinary employees.  From the interesting it is shown that even such difficult processes as restructuring, mergers associated with layoffs and other bad ones, for ordinary employees, the consequences can be carried out without serious harm to the working climate in the organization, if you properly manage people's emotions using this very Emotional Leadership.  Everything is described quite clearly in examples, so that the sensation of a ‚Äúspherical leader in a vacuum‚Äù is not created. <br><br>  If you sum up. <br>  The main disadvantage of the book is the language by which it is written.  The density of advertising revolutions and phrases just rolls over, whole paragraphs are just about anything.  Sometimes because of this, isolating the meaning is rather difficult. <br>  The advantage of the book is the abundance of all sorts of examples in which the stories from your own work experience are completely recognizable.  This greatly facilitates the understanding of the problems described. <br>  In general, the book is worthy of attention, although a technical person, before reading it is necessary to have some fair patience. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/93879/">https://habr.com/ru/post/93879/</a></p>
