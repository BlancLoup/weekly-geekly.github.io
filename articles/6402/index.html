The second has changed the first long ago, and it happened gradually and smoothly.  What is popular now seems so obvious and understandable that the name ‚ÄúWeb 2.0‚Äù doesn‚Äôt turn.  Too pathetic name for everyday things like Livejournal or Google. <br><br>  The epoch of home pages and e-mail exchange was forgotten even faster than ‚ÄúHello, bear!‚Äù But I remember how to collect information for a school essay on the Web once was not something out of the ordinary ‚Äî it was a mockery of traditional , book and library sources of information, and, of course, teachers terribly did not like it. <br><br>  However, like it, do not like it - time is not worth it, and the Network is all the more so.  Five years ago, it was hard for me to imagine that the reports for the institute classes would be prepared during the breaks with the help of laptops with Wi-Fi and PowerPoint, and then through the projector to be demonstrated in class.  A laptop and a projector are the same ordinary things as a rag, chalk and blackboard.

      Do you think if all this is now, then what will happen next? <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  People are really thinking about it (see <a href="http://www.habrahabr.ru/blog/translations/6537.html">‚ÄúInternet based on common sense‚Äù</a> , <a href="http://www.habrahabr.ru/blog/columns/6409.html">‚ÄúWeb 3.0 will stir up human civilization‚Äù</a> ), and so I decided to draw a picture of the ‚Äúfuture web‚Äù - as I see it. <br><br>  Briefly and in the theses ‚ÄúWeb 3.0‚Äù is: <br><br>  1. <b>‚ÄúForever on line‚Äù</b> . <br>  Round-the-clock and ubiquitous online. <br><br>  The network cable for the computer is as important as the power cable. <br>  A computer that is not connected to an electrical outlet and a computer that is not connected to the Internet are equally useless. <br><br>  The speed of the Internet is comparable to the speed of access to the hard disk. <br>  It is not clear that it is faster to find the file through a local search or through Google;  Watch a movie from your hard drive or directly from YouTube.  I am already silent about finding the right song on a CD in the closet for much longer than downloading it from the network. <br>  2. <b>The collection is not pages, but information</b> . <br>  The phrase ‚ÄúAsk Yandex‚Äù has a literal meaning: a search engine understands questions like ‚ÄúI'm looking for a hotel no more than $ 100 a day at a warm resort overlooking the sea to rest there for two weeks in June‚Äù and displays possible options, taking into account not only the room rate in advance and the location of the hotel, but also the availability of rooms for June and reviews of other guests. <br><br>  A network is not a collection of pages, but a collection of theses ‚Äî informational atoms ‚Äî each of which has exactly one meaning. <br>  From these atoms, like Lego cubes, web services build responses to user requests. <br>  3. <b>Instead of programs - web services</b> .  <b>Instead of the operating system - the browser</b> . <br>  Imagine that when you buy a computer in a store, you turn it on and see only one installed program - a web browser.  Everything else is on the Internet. <br>  Want to create a text document - go to MicrosoftWord.com.  Do you want to save the results of work - at your service hosting or blog - all your files and documents are stored there. <br>  Web services, unlike stationary programs, are regularly updated, and you don‚Äôt need to think about it.  For example, you noticed how many times in the whole history LiveJournal.com was updated and what version number is it now? <br><br>  This is not to say that the concept of ‚Äúinstalling a new version of Winamp on your computer‚Äù is absolutely meaningless.  The same delusional notion, as if to say now ‚ÄúI downloaded a new Yandex‚Äù. <br>  The issue of free of charge, I think, will be solved in each case in its own way, but there will be enough technology for that.  For example, access to the site KasperskyAntivirus.com may be for a subscription fee.  Understandably, through WebMoney. <br><br>  And if you think about it, all this is already there, in one form or another.  Online is distributed in villages, Webster's has given way to Wikipedia, and the programs themselves are updated via the Internet.  The third generation also smoothly replaces the second, as it once changed the first. <br><br>  Microsoft long ago chose the correct strategy of ‚Äúinternetization‚Äù of Windows, but so far, despite the abundance of Internet lotions in Windows, the system operates in the old paradigm.  Although Windows Update is now an integral part of Windows, huge distributions of Microsoft Office go on DVD and are installed on machines offline, and programs go to the Network only for ‚Äúpatches.‚Äù  And there is a very real chance to overtake Microsoft by an entire generation - first of all, this refers to their main competitors - the developers of Unix, Linux and others like them.  By the way - a hint of an OS that consists of one browser gives us the latest versions of Opera with its widgets.  But who will be the first to develop a fully networked full operating system?  However, it may not be open source, but Google or Apple. <br><br>  The network is developing extremely fast.  We can only keep up with her.  Or at least persuade yourself that we have time. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/6402/">https://habr.com/ru/post/6402/</a></p>
