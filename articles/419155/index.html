    <h3>  VLIW architecture </h3><br>  A completely different architectural solution than superscalar architecture, which is more common in the market now.  VLIW allows you to more subtly express intentions in the code due to the explicit control of all independent arithmetic logic units (ALUs), which Elbrus has, by the way, 4. This does not exclude the possibility of some ALU being idle, but still increases theoretical performance by one clock cycle. processor. <br><br><h3>  Team Bundling </h3><br>  Ready processor teams are combined in bundles (Bundles).  One bundle is one big instruction that runs in a conditional cycle.  There are many atomic instructions in it that are executed independently and immediately in the architecture of Elbrus. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e77/da3/ebc/e77da3ebc083c57d019b34bbc58483af.png"><br><br>  In the image on the right, gray rectangles indicate bundles that were obtained by processing the JS code on the left.  If the instructions ldd, fmuld, faddd, fsqrts are all pretty clear, then the return statement at the very beginning of the first bundle is surprising to people who are not familiar with the Elbrus assembler.  This instruction loads the return address from the current floatMath function into the ctpr3 register in advance so that the processor can manage to load the necessary instructions.  Then in the last bundle, we are already making the transition to the pre-loaded address in ctpr3. <br><br>  It is also worth noting that Elbrus has much more registers 192 + 32 + 32 against 16 + 16 +8 for x86. <br><br><h3>  Explicit speculative versus implicit </h3><br>  Elbrus maintains clear speculation at the command level.  Therefore, we can call and load a.bar from memory even before checking that it is not null, as can be seen in the code on the right.  If the reading logically at the end proves invalid, then the value in b will simply be marked with hardware as incorrect and will not be accessed. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/822/ec0/bcb/822ec0bcbb07ec7cff3a3e35656ef99e.png"><br><br><h3>  Conditional support </h3><br>  Elbrus also supports conditional execution.  Consider this in the following example. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a34/39b/005/a3439b00564ddec3a66383e76bb58b96.png"><br><br>  As we can see, the code from the previous example about speculativeness is also reduced by using the convolution of a conditional expression into a dependency not on control, but on data.  Elbrus hardware supports predicate registers, in which only two values ‚Äã‚Äãof true or false can be stored.  Their main feature is that you can label instructions with such a predicate and depending on its value at the time of execution, the instruction will be executed or not.  In this example, the cmpeq instruction performs a comparison and places its logical result in the P1 predicate, which is then used as a marker to load the value from b into the result.  Accordingly, if the predicate was true, then the result is left with the value 0. <br><br>  This approach allows you to transform a rather complicated graph of program management into predicate execution and, accordingly, increases the fullness of the bundle.  Now we can generate more independent commands under different predicates and fill them with bundles.  Elbrus supports 32 predicate registers, which allows coding 65 control flows (plus one for the absence of a predicate on a command). <br><br><h3>  Three hardware stacks compared with one at Intel </h3><br>  Two of them are protected from modification by the programmer.  One ‚Äî the chain stack ‚Äî is responsible for storing addresses for returns from functions, the other ‚Äî the stack of registers ‚Äî contains the parameters through which they are passed.  The third, the user stack, stores variables and user data.  In intel, everything is stored in one stack, which causes vulnerabilities, since all the addresses of transitions, parameters are in one place that is not protected from modifications by the user. <br><br><h3>  No dynamic conversion predictor </h3><br>  Instead, an if-conversion scheme and transition preparations are used to prevent the execution pipeline from stopping. <br><br><h3>  So why do we need JS on Elbrus? </h3><br><ol><li>  Import Substitution <br></li><li>  Elbrus is brought to the home computers market, where Javascript is already required for the same browser. <br></li><li>  In the industry, Elbrus is already needed, for example from Node.js.  Therefore, you need to port Node under this architecture. <br></li><li>  The development of architecture Elbrus, as well as specialists in this field. <br></li></ol><br><h3>  If there is no interpreter, two compilers come </h3><br>  It was based on the previous implementation of v8 from Google.  It works like this: an abstract syntax tree is created from the source code, then, depending on whether the code was executed or not, an optimized or non-optimized binary code is created using one of two compilers (Crankshaft or FullCodegen), respectively.  There is no interpreter. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/569/0ab/9f1/5690ab9f1edaf8273f6fe62b64110d27.png"><br><br><h3>  How does FullCodegen work? </h3><br>  The nodes of the syntactic tree are translated into binary code, after which everything is ‚Äúglued together‚Äù.  One node represents about 300 lines of code on a macro assembler.  This, firstly, gives a wide horizon of optimizations, and, secondly, there are no bytecode transitions, as in the interpreter.  This is simple, but at the same time there is a problem - during porting you will have to rewrite a lot of code on a macro assembler. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/6b8/38c/79a/6b838c79ab83cd76a498d82bf4ac3884.png"><br><br>  Nevertheless, all this was done, and the version of the compiler FullCodegen 1.0 for Elbrus was obtained.  Everything was done through C ++ runtime v8, nothing was optimized, the assembler code was simply rewritten from x86 to the Elbrus architecture. <br><br><h3>  Codegen 1.1 </h3><br>  As a result, the result was not exactly what was expected, and it was decided to release version FullCodegen 1.1: <br><br><ul><li>  They made less runtime, wrote on a macro assembler; <br></li><li>  Added manual if-conversions (in the figure, as an example, the js variable is checked for true or false); <br></li></ul><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/588/974/2f1/5889742f19fa70280dcb5665e1e733d8.png"><br><br>  Note that checking for NaN, undefined, null is done at once, without using if, which would be required in the Intel architecture. <br><br><ul><li>  The code was not just rewritten from Intel, but implemented speculative stubs and implemented fast-path through MAsm (macro assembler) too. <br></li></ul><br>  Tests were conducted in Google Octane.  Test machines: <br><br><ul><li>  Elbrus: E2S 750 MHz, 24 GB <br></li><li>  Intel: core i7 3.4 GHz, 16 GB <br></li></ul><br>  Further results: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/fb4/922/ff5/fb4922ff553518321227b4a0c57f91bd.png"><br><br>  The histogram shows the ratio of results, i.e.  how many times Elbrus is worse than Intel.  On the two tests of Crypto and zlib, the results are noticeably worse due to the fact that Elbrus does not yet have hardware instructions for working with encryption.  In general, given the difference in frequencies, it turned out well. <br><br>  Further, the test is compared to the js interpreter from firefox, included in the standard delivery of Elbrus.  More is better. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/0ab/c77/0d4/0abc770d4a1717ca18156070f0b762a4.png"><br>  Verdict - the compiler coped well again. <br><br><h3>  Development results </h3><br><ul><li>  New JS-engine passed test262 tests.  This gives him the right to be called a full-fledged ECMAScript execution environment 262. <br></li><li>  Productivity has increased on average by five times compared with the previous engine - interpreter. <br></li><li>  Node.js 6.10 was also ported as an example of using V8, since it was not difficult. <br></li><li>  However, it's still worse than Core i7 on FullCodegen, seven times. <br></li></ul><br><h3>  It seemed nothing foreshadowed </h3><br>  Everything would be fine, but then Google announced that it no longer supports FullCodegen and Crankshaft and they will be deleted.  After that, the team received an order for development for the Firefox browser, and more on that later. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/9d7/f15/543/9d7f155439ad3b1436ebc4cc9c59d50a.png"><br><br><h2>  Part 2. Firefox and its spider monkey </h2><br>  It's about the browser engine Firefox - SpiderMonkey.  The figure shows the differences between this engine and the newer V8. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c91/301/274/c9130127464ac436103ab6e8ed8c187d.png"><br><br>  It can be seen that at the first stage, everything looks like, the source code is parsed into an abstract syntax tree, then into a byte code, and then the differences begin. <br><br>  In SpiderMonkey, the bytecode is interpreted by the C ++ interpreter, which in essence resembles a large switch, inside which bytecode jumps are performed.  Further, the interpreted code falls into the Baseline non-optimizing compiler.  Then, at the final stage, the Ion optimizing compiler is included.  In the V8 engine, the bytecode is processed by the Ingnition interpreter, and then by the TurboFan compiler. <br><br><h3>  Baseline, choose you! </h3><br>  Porting started with the Baseline compiler.  It is essentially a stack machine.  That is, there is a certain stack from which cells it takes variables, remembers them, performs some actions with them, and then returns both variables and the results of actions back to the stack cells.  Below in several pictures this mechanism is shown step by step with respect to the simple function foo: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d4a/8fb/d66/d4a8fbd66d65c39e23a22ed8c21b844e.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/744/c7a/927/744c7a92704b61ec0063a5223de84bda.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/fdd/0bb/b3f/fdd0bbb3f000f2738af72ee77afbc719.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/cfe/b02/db2/cfeb02db22e24368fca8632db5cf93f2.png"><br><br><h3>  What is a frame? </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/4a8/386/e3c/4a8386e3c926b0175dcd7508cfbd0783.png"><br><br>  In the images above, you can see the word frame.  Roughly speaking, this is a Javascript context on the hardware, that is, a dataset on the stack that describes any of your functions.  The image below shows the foo function, and to the right of it is what it looks like on the stack: arguments, function description, return address, indication of the previous frame, because the function was called from somewhere and in order to return to the call point correctly, this information must be stored in the stack, and then the local variables themselves and the operands for the calculations. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/14d/c18/a75/14dc18a750ddcddf752bc1ed53a6eed0.png"><br><br>  Thus, the <b>advantages of Baseline</b> : <br><br><ul><li>  Similar to FullCodegen, therefore, his porting experience came in handy; <br></li><li>  Porting the assembler, we get a working compiler; <br></li><li>  Convenient to debug; <br></li><li>  Any stub can be rewritten. <br></li></ul><br>  But there are also <b>disadvantages</b> : <br><br><ul><li>  Linear code, until you execute one byte code, you will not be able to execute the next one, which is not very good for a parallel computing architecture; <br></li><li>  Since it works with bytecode, you are not particularly optimizing. <br></li></ul><br>  It only remained to implement a macro assembler and get a ready-made compiler.  Debugging also did not foretell any particular problems, it was enough to look at the stack on the x86 architecture, and then on the one that was obtained when porting to find the problem. <br><br>  As a result, according to tests with a new compiler, the performance has increased three times: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/79e/20b/20b/79e20b20b8126f69cd9031c406af0da0.png"><br><br>  However, Octane does not support exceptions.  And their implementation is very important. <br><br><h3>  Exceptional work </h3><br>  First, let's look at how x86 exceptions work.  While the program is running, return addresses from functions are written to the stack.  At some point an exception occurs.  We turn into the runtime exception handler, which uses the frames we talked about above.  We find where exactly the exception occurred, after which we need to unwind the stack to the desired state, and then the return address is changed to the one where the exception will be processed. <br><br>  The problem is that due to a different stack device on the Elbrus architecture, this will not work.  It will be necessary to calculate the system calls, how much you need to rewind back in the chain stack.  Next, do a system call to get a call stack.  Next in the address in the chain stack we make a replacement with the address that makes a return. <br><br>  Below is an illustration about the order of these steps. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/21e/288/52b/21e28852b593e04e9712f55ced7484a5.png"><br><br>  Not the fastest way, however, the exception is handled.  Still, on Intel, it looks somehow simpler: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f4d/e44/ee6/f4de44ee6d999e24e8a275b027c4442e.png"><br><br>  With Elbrus, there will be more jumps up to the handler: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/8cc/239/b1f/8cc239b1f908dc1ab6c02953ef7641d9.png"><br>  That is why you should not base the logic of the program on exceptions, especially on Elbrus. <br><br><h3>  Optimize it! </h3><br>  So, exception handling is implemented.  Now let's tell you how we made it all a bit faster: <br><br><ul><li>  Rewrote inline caches; <br></li></ul><br><ul><li>  Made a manual (and then automatic) arrangement of delays; <br></li><li>  They made the preparation of transitions (higher in code): the earlier the transition is prepared the better; <br></li><li>  Supported incremental garbage collector <br></li></ul><br>  On the second paragraph, we‚Äôll dwell a little more detail.  We have already considered a small example of working with bundles, and we‚Äôll go to it. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/805/722/9dd/8057229ddec6aa5091fa132de5506a9a.png"><br><br>  Any operation, for example, loading is not done in one cycle, in this case it is done in three cycles.  Thus, if we want to multiply two numbers, we have come to the multiplication operation, but the operands themselves have not yet been loaded, the processor needs only to wait for them to load.  And he will wait for a certain number of bars, a multiple of four.  But if you manually set the delay, the waiting time can be reduced, thereby increasing the speed.  Further, the process of delaying was automated. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/af7/721/cba/af7721cba060984416301fb89004a502.png"><br><br>  Results optimization BaseLine v1.0 vs Baseline v1.1.  Undoubtedly, the engine has become faster. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/8f3/d34/6cf/8f3d346cf9c1731bff2d85d0e52df5eb.png"><br><br><h3>  How is it for programmers and not to make Ion's gun? </h3><br>  In the wake of the success of the implementation of Baseline v1.1, it was decided to port and optimizing compiler Ion. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b97/887/d35/b97887d35eae9e30d300fa7d60b24942.png"><br><br>  How does an optimizing compiler work?  The source code is interpreted, compilation is started.  During the execution of the bytecode, Ion collects data about the types used in the program, the analysis of "hot functions" - those that are performed more often than others.  After that, the decision is made to compile them better, optimize.  Next, a high-level compiler representation, operation graph is constructed.  An optimization occurs on the graph (opt 1, opt 2, opt ...), a low-level representation is created consisting of machine commands, registers are reserved, a directly optimized binary code is generated. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/294/80d/48a/29480d48a92487c40bd4a7de91c7b1ef.png"><br><br>  There are more registers on Elbrus and the teams themselves are big, so we need: <br><br><ul><li>  Team planner; <br></li><li>  Own register allocator; <br></li><li>  Own LIR (Low-level Intermediate Representation); <br></li><li>  Own Code-generator. <br></li></ul><br>  The team already had experience of porting Java to Elbrus, they decided to use the same library for code generation for porting Ion.  It is called TANGO.  It has: <br><br><ul><li>  Team planner; <br></li><li>  Own register allocator; <br></li><li>  Low-level optimizations. <br></li></ul><br>  It remains to bring a high-level view in TANGO, to make a selector.  The problem is that the low-level representation in TANGO is similar to an assembler that is difficult to maintain and debug.  What should the compiler look like inside?  In Mozilla, for greater clarity, they made their own compiler, HolyJit, there is also another option to write your own mini-language for translation between high-level and low-level representation. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/0a3/6b2/94b/0a36b294b7fb8241b5be77a22a4d0e09.png"><br><br>  Development is still underway.  Well, then how not to overdo it with optimization. <br><br><h2>  Part 3. The best is the enemy of the good. </h2><br><h3>  Compilation as it is </h3><br>  The process of optimization in Ion, when the code is heated, and then compiled and optimized - greedy, it can be seen in the following example. <br><br><pre><code class="javascript">function foo(a, b) {
 &nbsp;return a + b;
