      I have been registered on Ebay since 2007, then I was just 16 years old and I ran to open a Visa Classic bank card (at that time, PayPal accepted cards of no lower than this level).  It was on / in Ukraine, the card was issued quickly, PayPal subsequently no less quickly removed from it 2 dollars and thus I had a full account on Ebay. <br>  The first purchase was successful, though with a little nervousness and, as a result, a used LG Prada handset.  The purchase was terribly pleased. <br>  Six months later, he caught fire on a new purchase, and the Nokia N73 ME was acquired from the American for a record low of $ 150, they sent me a Chinese fake and a lot of frustration.  Immediately opened a dispute on PayPal, after talking with the seller turned it into a complaint (claim), representatives of the payment system advised to send the package back with tracking, which was done soon, tracking was also attached to the complaint.  After a while, PayPal closed the complaint, accusing me of falsifying tracking numbers.  Thus, I was left without money and without a Chinese phone. <br><br>  This episode made me temper the heat and I forgot about the auction. <br><br>  Later, I ended up in the Czech Republic, they sent me there to study, where I am today. <br>  Very incidentally, I remembered Ebay and began to gradually get involved in online purchases.  I will not bore readers about all my purchases and sales, but I will only tell you about the most interesting ones.  By the way, my first lot for sale was a broken wireless mouse, successfully acquired by some lucky one for $ 1.5. <br><br>  The most interesting thing is how PayPal works here.  Most of the cases (cases) that I opened as a result were resolved in my favor.  Somehow, a Chinese Gucci bag counterfeit, purchased for 170 evergreens, arrived.  The seller refused, a complaint to PayPal indicating the inauthenticity of the goods, and after a while I received a letter from PayPal staff encouraging me to sign a piece of paper that I would destroy the bag myself.  sending it to the seller may violate the law.  I signed the paper, sent it by fax and returned the money after 3 days. <br>  An unsuccessful experience was the acquisition of Sandisk microsd card 16gb for very little money, as a result, the card contained no more than 2 gig.  Paypal complaint stating that the product is a fake.  Asked for confirmation of the words.  I made a couple of photos for the digital SLR, uploaded it on the photo-trash and unsubscribed on the off-forum Sandisk about the problem, they confirmed to me that the card was nothing but a fake.  I sent a link to this correspondence to PayPal, made a couple of screenshots for reliability.  A few days later the case was decided in favor of the seller, allegedly I did not prove that the card was a fake.  Such pies. <br>  But in general, I bought and sold quite a lot on Ebay, in 4 years I collected about 200 reviews.  I also bought Chinese players and all kinds of covers on the phone and films, bought original equipment (of well-known brands), mice, keyboards, telephones, although I buy the latest ones on Ebay.co.uk, it takes 3-5 days to the Czech Republic and the phones are not locked to American operators . <br><br>  Now to the most important thing, my advice to you, since you decided to plunge into the world of auctions: <br>  - Always look at the sellers' reviews, pay attention if it is a private trader (they usually have little goods for sale and in a single copy) or a business seller (by the way, they even have a mark in the profile) if they are not sure about the lot or the price is too low look if there have already been similar precedents in the form of reviews in the past.  Take the time to examine the seller if the amount is significant. <br>  - Always carefully read the description of the goods, whether it is not enough what is written in the title and what pictures the seller used, if the description clearly states that this product is not working or is not a product at all, but only a brochure, then most likely you won‚Äôt win. <br>  - Do not be lazy and feel free to ask specific questions to the seller in personal correspondence before purchasing the goods, in case of problems you can use as indirect evidence of your correctness. <br>  - In the realities of the CIS, open the parcel at the post office in the presence of employees, you can also shoot the process on camera.  The more evidence you gather, the more likely it is that Ebay will side with you in a given dispute. <br>  - If you won a lot and the seller refused to send it to you, simply politely ask you to cancel the transaction (cancel my purchase).  If he rests and opens a dispute about non-payment, quietly peacefully pay for the goods, and after 5 days ask the seller to return the money, usually return, do not want, boldly open a dispute in Ebay and they will return the money to you, rather quickly, I wanted would notice. <br>  - If you have problems with goods up to 100 evergreens, I advise you to open a dispute directly in Ebay, they work there very quickly and almost always on the buyer's side.  If the amount exceeds the above, then you have a direct way (I wanted to write to Add) to PayPal, they work slower there, they need more evidence, but the chances of getting money are much higher.  Ebay can just give you a coupon for this amount, which is not good. <br>  - from the user <a href="http://ayrm.habrahabr.ru/">ayrm</a> ‚ÄúBe sure to keep all correspondence through eBay and nothing else.  If emails arrive simply by email - ignore and ask the seller questions via eBay.  You can also warn him there that you will not correspond with him, so that it would remain in the ‚Äúhistory‚Äù of the transaction if there will be a subsequent disassembly.  "Good advice, and as usual, the author's spelling is preserved :-) <br>  - The latest and most reliable advice, do not rush to cheap, if the proposal is too good to be true, then most likely - this is a scam. <br>  For this, I hasten to bow out, thanks for reading to the end, for all the pleasant purchases. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/123364/">https://habr.com/ru/post/123364/</a></p>
