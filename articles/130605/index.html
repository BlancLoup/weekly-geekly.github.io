  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The future of computer games exclusively for AI</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Hello, I want to share my thoughts about the future in the gaming industry.  About why developers will not make games at a resolution of more than full HD, that 5.1 sound will forever become standard in games, which will do nothing better than a joystick.  But the games will be more interesting and attractive. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>  A real limitation in games is first the person himself, his way of perceiving the world, and only then game consoles, computers and keyboards. <br><br>  First, let's deal with the sound.  We hear a certain range of sound waves and all modern systems almost completely cover this range, of course it is not as good as in real life, but what a modern 5.1 sound system gives is more than enough for any modern game.  Of course, when you shoot an AK-74 in a modern game and forget to open your mouth a little, you don‚Äôt lay your ears, and a grenade that exploded nearby will not rupture your eardrums.  But this does not disappoint the player and leads to the fact that the vast majority of players have a built-in sound card that fully satisfies them.  And the developers understand the players and are also in no hurry to implement complex sound effects in modern games, rarely in the game someone brags about the Doppler effect, etc.  Why?  Players just do not notice these little things.  A miscalculation of the reflection of sound waves and various effets of the medium force us to make very complex calculations in real time.  Well, why do all this for the player, if he just does not notice.

      A similar picture will happen soon with graphics.  Why?  It's all about the screen resolution.  Nowadays, modern games support full HD, and this is 1920 by 1080 pixels on the screen, which is more than enough if you are sitting in front of the TV on the couch, and not close.  After all, our eyesight and hearing are not unlimited, there is no point in making points on the screen a lot less than we can notice.  Knowing that the screen resolution does not change, you can safely say that the video cards will be transferred directly to the processor and their market will decrease dramatically.  And this is already happening now. <br><br>  Input devices, they have already come to their ideal state.  The joysticks from the first Sony (PS3) are almost identical to the joysticks from the third.  They got lighter, wireless and ... and that‚Äôs it!  Of course, someone loves the joystick more from the box (Xbox360), but is it any different?  Now there is a lot of talk about the fact that the future of input devices behind devices that directly read electromagnetic signatures from the player‚Äôs brain match them, approximate and transfer them to the game.  This technology is very interesting, but it will not work.  It's all about the very signatures of our brain, it just does not work the same and that's it.  Different areas of different people work in different ways and at different frequencies, of course, most people have a lot in common, but this is clearly not enough.  For example, when people are allowed to play around with this technology, they are offered to pick up objects, open doors, etc.  that is, to do very simple things and even in spite of this, many people cannot concentrate for a very long time or do not do enough to complete the action.  I want to say that this technology is promising in home security systems, where, according to the biological parameters of a person, the system will be able to open the door and turn off the light there and then when the person thought about it.  But this system is clearly not enough to control the character in the game when the user thinks: get down, shoot blindly through cover, dodge, jump behind the adjacent cover, grenade.  And the player does not say to himself during the game "bend down, shoot", etc.  we play and think only in images that are very different from person to person.  Therefore, the joystick for a long time secured the status of a leader.  For a human hand, a perfect embodiment mechanism, but this mechanism also has its limits, the number of fingers, the speed of pressing, the number of simultaneous pressing, etc.  Keyboards, steering wheels, mice will not disappear anywhere and will dominate their game genres. <br><br>  And what does this all mean for players?  This means that the golden age of creativity is coming soon.  The century when developers will invest their main potential in artificial intelligence, plot, new ideas, new worlds.  Just chasing new graphics will stop bringing guaranteed success to the project.  Developers will also benefit, because often very talented teams have not enough money for advanced engines and although they make interesting projects do not receive due attention. <br><br>  It is important to note that we all play games in our mind.  That is why it is often possible to find a very interesting game in which there are visually only pictograms, and the sounds are a system speaker, but the game is being played - do not come off.  Such a game is Civilization, but its last part already looks very nice.  I want to say that for any game, even a card, nice graphics and sound will not be superfluous. <br><br>  Artificial intelligence is the true future of computer games!  A lot depends on the measure of immersion in the game, and of course they are still trying to achieve this with graphics and sound, but as I said this method comes to an end.  A new and main way to evaluate future AAA class games is just AI.  Now, if you open any magazine on modern games and see how they are rated in such publications, it is clear that there is no separate AI criterion anywhere.  We are told what sound, how convenient control, how much texture, what kind of graphics, and only casually mentioned that bots do not behave very adequately.  In modern games, characters are simply none, they are not able to surprise you with their behavior.  Designers try to get around this with a good storyline and dialogue, which we think out of behavior and sometimes it works.  Many game razbotchiki cheated and realized that it is much cheaper not to write AI and make a multiplayer game and let the players entertain themselves.  Clever!  But there are a lot of problems.  It is almost impossible to immerse you in a strong epic story, because at any moment you can turn off the computer and leave your online comrades, or they can also leave you.  You can fight this too only through AI.  And what is the present of AI is the initial one; in the newest games, they only started using AI to control the animation of characters, when a character can start running away from you by dodging weapons aimed at him, while dynamically assessing the situation and during a run down from a box flying into him . <br><br>  And here it turns out that in order to reach a simple level, when we believe that a man plays a bot, it is still very far away.  The future of computer games in Artificial Intelligence, everything else has reached a level when further improvement will not give such a strong impact on the player. <br><br>  I want to hear the thoughts of others on this. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/130605/">https://habr.com/ru/post/130605/</a></p>
