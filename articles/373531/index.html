Your attention is invited to the May hit parade of the most media scientific developments of Russian universities.  Let me remind you that this monthly project was started by us, on the one hand, in order to popularize Russian science, on the other hand, I really wanted to understand what scientific developments are getting good press and cause a resonance in the Russian media. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Recall the criteria that guide us in the preparation of the rating.  Studies are ranked according to the simplest and verifiable principle - the number of reprints of the original message.  The number of reprints is determined using the information-analytical system of monitoring and effective analysis of the Russian media "Medialogia".

      Only Russian developments and only developments of researchers from higher educational institutions of the Russian Federation are included in the rating. <br><br>  Another important caveat - according to the principle of ‚Äúnot to mix the immiscible‚Äù, the ranking does not represent the achievements of scientists working in the field of the humanities.  The reasons are clear - it is already clear that any research on pensions in the media plan will leave far behind all other studies.  For this, we do not include a variety of monitoring, measurements of subsistence minimum, etc.  studies performed with a known frequency. <br><br>  So, meet the most popular scientific developments in the media of the last month of spring: <br><br>  <a href="http://news.ifmo.ru/ru/science/it/news/6633/"><b>10. "Sundress" as unloading</b></a> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/28f/d9b/142/28fd9b142202ede45fa2d84eac5fb970.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  At the tenth position of the TOP-SCIENCE charts are scientists from ITMO University who decided to create a tool to help mobile operators to optimally distribute the load on the network during emergency situations and help plan the work of the towers during mass events.  To do this, scientists have created a computer simulation, which works on the principle of "word of mouth" and illustrates the spread of news among subscribers of the mobile network.  As the authors say, the information collected by them from open sources made it possible to create a basic model, but the amount of data is clearly insufficient for solving applied problems.  Perhaps they will be helped by a distribution scheme for news about their work. <br>  <i>10th place, 102 publications</i> <br><br>  <a href="https://www.dvfu.ru/news/science_and_innovation/scientists_fefu_and_feb_ras_found_a_way_to_make_the_amur_grape_is_more_useful/%3Fsphrase_id%3D318986"><b>9. Not green, but useful.</b></a> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/9af/85f/0f0/9af85f0f031ea82bbe2bece485b6d189.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Chemists of the Far Eastern Federal University, in collaboration with colleagues from the Far Eastern Branch of the Russian Academy of Sciences, have found a way to force the cells of Amur grapes to increase the production of resveratrol by a hundred times.  This substance may have a positive effect on the life expectancy of some invertebrates and short-lived fish, as well as potentially having a whole series of useful properties - from cardioprotective to antitumor.  However, the results of clinical studies in humans yet, and in experiments with animals, not everything is clear.  The authors of the source material even wrote the name of the substance through ‚Äúh‚Äù.  It is all the more surprising that the release has collected more than a hundred reprints in various media outlets, which allowed this development to reach 9th place in the TOP-SCIENCE charts. <br>  <i>9th place, 108 publications</i> <br><br>  <a href="https://www.dvfu.ru/news/science_and_innovation/physics_far_eastern_federal_university_far_eastern_branch_russian_academy_of_sciences_and_japan_the_world_s_first_synthesized_quantum_metal/%3Fsphrase_id%3D318976"><b>8. Quantum and two-dimensional</b></a> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/f58/956/be8/f58956be89e2b6a407322dc3502b59b8.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  In eighth place - the synthesis of the first quantum two-dimensional metal, carried out by scientists from the Far Eastern Federal University, the Far Eastern Branch of the Russian Academy of Sciences and the University of Tokyo (Japan).  The synthesized material is a double layer of thallium atoms on a monocrystalline silicon substrate.  Two-dimensional thallium at temperatures below 272 ¬∞ C enters the superconducting state, when exposed to a strong magnetic field, becomes an insulator, and in an intermediate-value magnetic field, it is a quantum metal.  As one researcher, RAS Corresponding Member Alexander Saranin, explained: ‚ÄúExperiments have shown that in addition to the transition to an insulating or superconducting state, a two-dimensional system can remain a normal metal.  This unusual condition has been called a quantum metal or Bose metal.  It was this material that we were able to synthesize and study its electronic properties. ‚Äù <br>  <i>8th place, 115 publications</i> <br><br>  <a href="http://news.ifmo.ru/ru/science/photonics/news/6645/"><b>7. Death to Quantum Hackers</b></a> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/393/e22/bb5/393e22bb55596665b576f26e23ad254b.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The seventh position continues the TOP-SCIENCE quantum theme of the hit parade.  A group of scientists from the Kazan Quantum Center KNRTU-KAI and ITMO University successfully launched the first in Russia multi-node quantum network in full mode.  For the first time in the domestic practice, the quantum channels on the basis of the existing urban telecommunications infrastructure are combined four points located in different parts of the capital of Tatarstan.  Quantum communications, as is known, guarantee the absolute invulnerability of communication lines for hacker attacks, which is why scientists from leading countries of the world are working on the development of these technologies.  Earlier in Russia, in the urban conditions, the lines of quantum communications were launched, connecting only two points. <br>  <i>7th place, 116 publications</i> <br><br>  <a href="http://news.sfu-kras.ru/node/18934"><b>6. "Writer, are you angry ..."</b></a> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/f94/dfa/d60/f94dfad6019bad83ff4d1934fae24163.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The linguists of the Institute of Philology and Language Communication of the Siberian Federal University, together with scientists from the Institute of Space and Information Technologies of the same SFU, created the technology of automatic analysis of the power of emotions contained in the text.  According to the developers, the existing systems for automatic text analysis allow evaluating only positive or negative text color based on keywords.  The development of Krasnoyarsk scientists will allow to evaluate not only the color of the text, but also the degree of its emotionality.  Based on the analysis of texts that displayed basic emotions (fear, anger, disgust, joy, surprise, etc.), Siberian scientists identified words and phrases characteristic of a particular emotion and created corresponding linguistic models.  Now linguists of the Siberian Federal University are working on a technology that allows to evaluate texts by the degree of manipulative influence on the reader.  Perhaps the popularity of the news - a consequence of the first results in this area. <br>  <i>6 place, 116 publications</i> <br><br>  <a href="https://www.dvfu.ru/news/science_and_innovation/students_of_the_university_have_created_a_prototype_of_an_economical_biological_prosthesis_hand/%3Fsphrase_id%3D318956"><b>5.

According to the developers, the main feature of the presented prototype was its cost-effectiveness: the prosthesis is created from inexpensive materials, its final cost does not exceed 60,000 rubles, while the minimum price of analogs is about half a million rubles.  However, later it turned out that when creating the prosthesis, the team used a print on a 3D printer made from biodegradable plastic, but, as Daniel Fonov assured, ‚Äúin the future we plan to make prostheses made of titanium and aluminum, and various designs, for example, a culture sleeve, made of carbon fiber ".  The promise of a cheap prosthesis allowed the student to take the fifth place in the TOP-SCIENCE charts. <br>  <i>5th place, 120 publications</i> <br><br>  <a href="https://mipt.ru/newsblog/lenta/sonnaya_arteriya_vydala_biologicheskiy_vozrast_cheloveka"><b>4.

They have been trying to solve the problem of its determination for many years, and the most successful techniques based on DNA status data allow this to be done with an error of less than three years.  However, they require very expensive equipment and specially trained specialists and therefore have not gained acceptance in practical medicine.  Studies by Russian scientists were based on data from a human carotid artery ultrasound and tonometry.  The results obtained with the help of the carotid artery are inferior in accuracy of working with DNA (an error of up to 6.9 years for men and 5.9 years for women), but these studies can be carried out in any modern clinic. <br>  <i>4 place, 124 publications</i> <br><br>  <a href="http://www.msu.ru/science/main_themes/drevniy-suslik-okazalsya-predstavitelem-sovremennogo-vida.html%3Fsphrase_id%3D1034957"><b>3. "The ancient gopher from the gulag" survived</b></a> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/8db/378/27e/8db37827ef6cd9b4c5308b14aba176a5.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The third place in the May TOP-SCIENCE ranking from NITU "MISiS" is given to the development of researchers of the biological faculty of the Moscow State University named after M.V.  Lomonosov, who studied the ancient Indigir longtail gopher and found that his descendants today live in Kamchatka.  Indigirsky, they are Bering gophers - a fossil species described by the Soviet zoologist Boris Vinogradov in three specimens, which were found by unknown prisoners of the Gulag in 1946 in vertical mountain pits at a depth of 12.5 meters.  The study of their range makes a great contribution to the understanding of transberingian connections and ways of settling different animals during the Pleistocene period in northeast Asia.  But the record number of reprints, of course, due to very different circumstances.  And if we add that, apart from the Kolyma prisoners, Jewish researchers working on DNA, fossil lice, wild fox Alice and a well-known photo blogger, also appear in this practically detective story, then one has to be surprised rather that this research received only "bronze" <br>  <i>3rd place, 125 publications</i> <br><br>  <a href="http://www.tsu.ru/news/rossiyskiy-konkurent-windows-prokhodit-pervye-ispy/"><b>2.

In fact, Tomsk IT people write only the first domestic software tool complex for creating automated control systems for high-tech industries.  In May, a team of Tomsk citizens, which includes TSU researchers and specialists from EleSi, conducted preliminary tests of the first version of the complex.  As explained by Alexander Zamyatin, director of the Center for Computer Science and Technology at TSU, ‚Äúsince many of the fuel and energy facilities still use Windows OS, a weighted solution may be to develop such software solutions that can be reconfigured with an alternative Windows operating environment with minimal effort‚Äù.  The created software system operates under the control of Unix-like operating systems, and allows for the collection, processing and storage of production and technological data, to solve the problems of planning, distribution and control of the production process in real time. <br>  <i>2 place, 168 publications</i> <br><br>  <a href="http://minpromtorg.gov.ru/press-centre/news/"><b>1.

A significant contribution to the interest of the media was made by the head of the Ministry of Industry and Trade of Russia Denis Manturov, who in May announced that he would provide full support to the project from the ministry.  The project team began work on a solar vehicle in May 2016.  The machine has the shape of a catamaran hull, its hull is made of composite materials produced in Russia.  The car receives electrical energy from 4 sq.m.  solar panels installed on the roof, KDP panels - 24%.  The weight of the car is no more than 200 kg, the maximum speed is 150 km / h.  Note that Denis Manturov is not the first high-ranking official who spoke in support of this project.  Earlier, at the meeting of the Council under the President of the Russian Federation on the modernization of the economy and the innovative development of Russia, Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev showed great interest in the ‚Äúsolar car‚Äù. <br>  <i>1st place, 196 publications</i> <br><br>  In addition, in May, Russian scientists discovered "elf frogs" in the highland forests of Vietnam, accelerated the growth of cedars and cows, figured out how the evolutionary reduction of insects affects their organs, created contact lenses with a therapeutic effect, described the first Russian crayfish and worked on solving many no less important problems.  However, the number of reprints in the media did not allow these scientific developments to get into the TOP-SCIENCE hit parade from NUST MISiS. <br><br>  In the summer there will be new discoveries by Russian scientists, which TOP-SCIENCE will tell in early July.  We do not say goodbye! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/373531/">https://habr.com/ru/post/373531/</a></p>
