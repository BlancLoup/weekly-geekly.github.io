  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Conceptual model of an individual approach to teachers and students in the organization and planning of the educational process at the university</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  At present, education is beginning to be recognized by society as the most important factor not only in technological and socio-economic development, but also in the survival of civilization, as a condition for overcoming global ecological and spiritual crises.  Most researchers rightly believe that since the existing educational practice does not meet modern requirements and cannot provide timely and adequate preparation of people for the future that is rapidly approaching, it needs a radical restructuring, strategically focused on the challenges of the 21st century. <br><br>  The development of telecommunications means allows experts to predict the emergence of full-fledged opportunities to acquire the necessary knowledge, skills and competencies on individual learning paths at any age and in any point in space.  Such a concept would require such a planning and organization of the educational process from universities, when not the plans but the wishes of the students and the capabilities of the teachers will be in the first place.  This approach mimics the laws of the market - both teachers offer a set of courses, and students express a desire to study them, and students make requests for the formation of disciplines with specific competencies and substantive part, and teachers develop these courses. <br><br>  I propose to your court a conceptual model of an individual approach to teachers and students in organizing and planning the educational process in a higher educational institution. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b16/d03/3b7/b16d033b73ff7f67c73a8cb740195625.jpg" alt="image"></div>

      In the first step, the student should become familiar with his basic work curriculum and, having analyzed it, form a list of disciplines that he plans to study in the next academic year.  All students should see what the total flow of students who have shown a desire to learn the chosen discipline at the moment.  Also, the student has the right to offer to study a discipline that is not conducted at the university.  It is necessary to indicate an exemplary description, content and the desired set of competencies for the discipline.  This discipline, which is not yet officially approved and not conducted, students can also choose as desired to study. <br><br>  In the second step, the teacher already evaluates the expected contingent of students for the next academic year, their work plans, as well as the student list of desired disciplines to study.  Based on this information, the teacher forms his study load for the next academic year: indicates the minimum and maximum possible study load;  forms approximate flows indicating the maximum and minimum number of students;  indicates other teaching assistants by type of classes.  At the same time, he creates new training courses. For each discipline, the teacher may indicate a list of alternative disciplines that are taught at the university, or were requested by students as new ones.  Also, detailed annotations are given to the disciplines, as well as the formed competencies, prerequisites, as well as material and technical resources and organizational requirements for the course.  It should be noted that the teacher must form the study load "with a reserve" - ‚Äã‚Äãfor an alternative choice for students.  The alternative load must not be less than the declared minimum load on the teacher. <br><br>  According to the results of the formation of approximate flows by teachers, the system generates training flows for subsequent registration for students by discipline.  All missing required flows are created by the management department.  The head of the department monitors the process of formation of individual study loads and controls that students have the opportunity to choose not only the disciplines of the mandatory and variable parts, but also the alternative ones. <br><br>  At the next stage, registration of students for the discipline is opened.  The student, in accordance with the financial possibilities, taking into account the requirements for the maximum and minimum academic load, is an individual curriculum for the next academic year.  The student gets acquainted with the catalog of disciplines: looks at the description, formed competencies, history of course modification, statistics on training and progress, as well as reviews of those who completed the course.  The choice of disciplines is regulated according to the prerequisites.  The student has the right to study discipline in circumvention of the requirements for prerequisites, if he can confirm the set of knowledge and / or competencies necessary to study the chosen course.  The decision is made by a special commission of the profile department.  For the preparation of a rational and optimal individual curriculum, the student can use the help of a consultant. <br><br>  Together with the workload, the student should be provided with a financial calculator when he can estimate the approximate amount that he will need to pay for each planned training course for the next academic year (taking into account possible refinancing).  Students studying on a budgetary basis will also be shown an approximate scholarship, which they will receive for each academic semester.  This scheme gives the student the opportunity to control not only their workload, but also to look at the financial support of education. <br><br>  After the end of the registration period for disciplines, the process of checking educational flows for quality is launched, according to the results of which work, adjustments are made to the teaching load, unprofitable flows are disbanded (and destroyed).  <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A2%25D1%258C%25D1%258E%25D1%2582%25D0%25BE%25D1%2580">A tutor</a> (mentor) works out with each student who has not successfully completed the registration process for disciplines an individual learning path. <br><br>  At the end of the registration process (re-registration) for the disciplines, registration forms for each student are formed, printed and signed.  On the basis of the registration form, the student‚Äôs individual study plan is formed <br><br>  According to the results of registration (re-registration) for the disciplines, the calculation of hours in the departments is formed.  The management of the department distributes the free study load among teachers.  Based on the distributed calculation of hours, the instruction of the academic load on the department is formed, as well as the university calculation of hours. <br><br>  The individual learning trajectory makes adjustments to the organization of the learning process: now there is no need to form an order to transfer a student from course to course.  When forming an individual learning path, when postponing the study of some disciplines for another term, the student sees in real time how his individual curriculum changes: the approximate duration of training changes, the academic load for each year, and can also manage financial matters. <br><br>  Thus, the university forms a bank of disciplines and students, as well as the possibility of an objective assessment of the compliance of the curriculum content with the requirements of employers. <br><br>  PS: This article intentionally does not mention the means of implementation, but it is quite natural to trace the need for the use of automated information systems. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/195840/">https://habr.com/ru/post/195840/</a></p>
