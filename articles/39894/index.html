  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Sleep culture</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Long ago, while I was in school, I was constantly tormented by the thought that, even though I was getting enough sleep, I get up painfully and do not want anything in the morning.  Deep in my soul, I knew that it could be otherwise, but how can you make you literally jump out of bed in the morning and go to turn the mountains back?  Began to understand everything, and that's what came of it. <br><a name="habracut"></a>  Further <br>  I must say that I do not pretend to something revolutionary.  All the tips that help me are simply collected here, but, given the similarity of the species, they should help you too =) <br>  So let's go. <br><br><h4>  A bit of theory </h4><br>  A person‚Äôs sleep is known to consist of 2 types: deep and fast.  And they have a certain order, which looks like this: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/64e/fe0/47a/64efe047a0adc77b96368968136dd191.jpg"><br>  As you can see, there are promzhetki, when we ourselves almost-almost wake up.  During this period, and it is desirable that someone woke us.  But it is fine, general information. <br><br><h4>  Steps to improve sleep </h4>

    <h5>  1. Air out the room before bed. </h5><br>  I agree, trite, but very effective.  The presence of fresh air in the room helps our brain to rest normally. <br><br><h5>  2. Rid yourself of temperature fluctuations. </h5><br>  It often happened that in order to comply with point one, I simply opened the window and then forgot to close it.  And at night it usually gets colder than during the day.  The result is that you have a bad sleep and in the morning you just can't get out of the blanket. <br><br><h5>  3. Calm exercises or walk before bedtime. </h5><br>  By calm exercises, I mean light stretching or breathing exercises.  It improves the flow of blood and oxygen to the brain.  The walk is the same - movement + breath. <br><br><h5>  4. Do not get enough! </h5><br>  Also a hackneyed fact, but again, very important.  Stuffing the stomach before bedtime does not lead to anything good.  Tightly eat is necessary for 3-4 hours before bedtime.  Drink a lot too.  A sandwich and an average cup of tea are possible, but more obviously not worth it.  Pity your body, he wants to sleep too, and not to recycle your food. <br><br><h5>  5. Good pillow and bed </h5><br>  Yes Yes Yes!  Very important thing.  Have you ever woken up with body and neck aches (I do not take into account the load to sleep)?  That's what we need to wisely choose the furniture and bedding.  Here it is difficult to give concrete advice, as long as it is convenient.  I use a medium hardness mattress and such a pillow: <br><br><img src="http://img242.imageshack.us/img242/2861/b90950341dbee46fb7rv0.jpg"><br><br><h5>  6. Lavender oil </h5><br>  For those who do not sleep well, lavender oil will help.  How to use: buy in the nearest pharmacy, open the vial and breathe a little in pairs (I have enough minutes), and then anoint it with whiskey.  You fall asleep instantly. <br><br><h5>  7. Gadgets </h5><br>  I must say: not once is not advertising.  Just sharing joy.  On Habr√© once slipped <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/the_future_is_here/16863/">an article</a> about watches Sleeptracker.  So, everything is correctly described there.  True, I use only the second week, but there is no limit to joy.  They do their work for 100. You no longer need to calculate with the leaflet how much this damn alarm clock should be set.  And they wake up so gently that not every girl can do that either =) <br><br><h5>  8. Wake up! </h5><br>  This is not a dream, but a good one too.  As soon as you wake up, sit down straight, inhale deeply and hold your breath.  It is necessary to detain as long as possible, while you just can not bear it anymore  After that, instantly wake up and move.  This technique was taken from Buteyko‚Äôs breathing techniques. <br><br>  That seems to be all, if you have something to add, please come in the comments. <br><br>  <b>Healthy sleep for a habrasoobshchestvu!</b>  <b>=)</b> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/39894/">https://habr.com/ru/post/39894/</a></p>
