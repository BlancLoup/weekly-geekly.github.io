The project began as a homework in free time for my own pleasure and the practice of new technologies for me. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/7c3/8a0/542/7c38a05424c0435db3a3525ffea935b8.png"><br><br>  Later, two of my friends expressed a desire to join, and we thought about how from such home crafts for ourselves to do something useful for others and bringing money.  From the title of the article it is quite clear what we have come to - spent money, time and nerves on unusual tasks for us, such as finding investors, planning the budget and other start-up crap and did not come to anything useful at the end.

      Realizing that the world of startups, so colorfully described by all who feel like it, does not suit us for personal reasons, we finished torturing ourselves and our loved ones and abandoned the project.  From time to time, I return to it, as before, to try new technologies or just take a break from the monotonous everyday life, where the concept of Right Development instead of Hrenax-Heraks-Production, so beloved by me, prevails. <br><br>  And so I realized that it was time to open this sandbox.  A bit about technology: <br><ul><li>  Node.js </li><li>  Express.js </li><li>  Mongo DB </li><li>  Gulp.js </li><li>  Angular.js </li><li>  Go-lang realizing image service </li></ul><br><br>  Open repository on <a href="https://github.com/MGrin/Eventorio">github</a> .  The name is Eventorio. <br>  I open the code for anyone interested.  The project is absolutely classic, with users, events, search by text.  You can look at crutches and show others how not to do it, you can look at interesting solutions and take them to your project.  You can write something for Eventorio, you can fork ... In general - <b>yet another failed project</b> . <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h1>  Start </h1><br>  Over a year ago I worked in the laboratory of my university.  Thanks to my colleagues, I realized that I really love web development, I don‚Äôt see anything wrong with JavaScript on the server, and in general the language is pleasant and appealing to me.  Before that I wrote in Java, Scala, Python, some C ++, but after developing on Node.js I decided for myself that I don‚Äôt want anything on the server for REST api implementations except for it.  Do not misunderstand me, each task has its own tool, and for the REST api development task, another social.  network, site for a startup or something similar, I choose Node for myself. <br><br>  Since the technologies on which they worked out in this lab, I knew badly, I decided to invent a small project for myself, on which I would perfect my skills.  The idea of ‚Äã‚Äãa website for organizing events, selling tickets and all other nishtyakov was born.  Since the project was not going to go out to the general public, for myself I described it as ‚ÄúI must do what Eventbrite, Facebook Events do and any service in the business of events‚Äù.  He sat, sawed, puffed, taught Angular, and learned the pros with the minuses of MongoDB with its NoSQL and all the pitfalls. <br><br>  After several months of such homeworking, a couple of my friends suggested that I make a start-up out of this cycling industry, since it is fashionable now, youth, and in general.  I doubted for some time in this undertaking, since I did not feel the strength and spirit of start-up building in myself, but decided to agree, since the university started a course on start-ups.  So we started going to the lecture to Edward Bunyon ( <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edouard_Bugnion">Edouard Bugnion</a> ) and turning the homegrown project into a proper startup. <br><br><h1>  Startup </h1><br>  It was a very interesting subject.  We built business models, thought about finances, looked for investors, went to venture kick, in general did everything that young active unemployed people do.  They gave presentations, told friends, advertised through word of mouth, because there was no money for marketing ... It was interesting. <br><br>  After three months of such running around, I realized that I did not want to do this.  Search for investors, presentations, financial numbers that are not based on anything ... I felt very bad and was mentally exhausted.  Thank God, on Habr√©, Giktaims and Megamind there are enough articles on the topic ‚ÄúWhy you shouldn‚Äôt do your startup‚Äù, which helped me not to get upset because of my failure.  As a result, all the developments on the startup were given to my friends, who sort of continued this business (and, I hope, they will succeed!).  And I returned to my usual quiet life, periodically returning to Eventorio for my own pleasure. <br><br><h1>  Conclusion </h1><br>  After these active three months, the project did not really budge.  A part of the Go functionality for image processing, tags, small fixes was added ... This development didn‚Äôt have a special purpose anymore, I just wrote code when there was a desire and time, without even thinking about the future of this project.  And now I decided that these developments could be interesting to someone, and I post all the code, as it is, on GitHub.  I understand that my actions are very presumptuous, that there are a huge number of such projects and stories, and each programmer has a couple of abandoned works, but I would really like this code to be useful to anyone. <br><br>  Well, if not, then so be it, like hundreds and thousands of open source projects on GitHub, useless and non-working. <br><br>  PS The site is spinning now on DigitalOcean with minimal configurations, so it may well fall from habraeffekt. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/255193/">https://habr.com/ru/post/255193/</a></p>
