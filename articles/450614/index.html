CMS for March and April 2019. In digest: news about Joomla, a selection of links to tools for developers and webmasters, an overview of solutions for e-commerce.  Unfortunately, due to the numerous trips to our homeland, the publication was so late that there was no point in posting it in March. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ge/we/8k/gewe8knhiv7exla6b8lotnwi170.png"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h2>  Joomla development </h2><br>  Joomla World Conference 2019 will be held from 8 to 10 November in London.  It is planned that the conference will be attended by about 400 people. <br>  Rumor has it that Joomla 4 will try to release for this event.  Although I would put on the release of Joomla 4 in December.

This year the familiar J and Beyond conference will not take place for everyone.  The organizers initially wanted to change the format of the conference and move it to the end of the year, but the date of the Joomla World Conference 2019 made adjustments. <br><br>  Joomla 4 releases released <img alt="en" src="https://habrastorage.org/storage3/2e2/522/737/2e2522737ec404a9f76047e108dfaea0.gif">  <a href="https://developer.joomla.org/news/771-joomla-4-is-on-the-horizon-alpha-7.html">Alpha 7</a> and <img alt="en" src="https://habrastorage.org/storage3/2e2/522/737/2e2522737ec404a9f76047e108dfaea0.gif">  <a href="https://developer.joomla.org/news/776-joomla-4-is-on-the-horizon-alpha-8.html">Alpha 8</a> .  The most important change in Alpha 7 is the basic implementation of REST web service support.  In the release of Alpha 8, the focus was on the merge releases of Joomla 3.9.x.

Perhaps you have already met, with the opinion of some users that Joomla is very difficult to write articles, many tabs and buttons.  So this manager will simplify editing and creating new articles.  In addition, it is free. <br><br><h2>  Joomla and e-commerce </h2><br>  In this section, we will once a month talk about any component for commerce on Joomla.  The goal is to show a variety of solutions.  Today we will tell about <a href="https://www.webdesigner-profi.de/joomla-webdesign/joomla-shop/">JoomShopping</a> . <br><br>  We conducted this section in an unusual format, and in the form of a brief interview with Igor aka Nevigen, he was one of those who brought JoomShopping to Russia. <br><br>  <b>Describe briefly what is Joomshopping?</b> <br><br>  Joomshopping is one of the components of the store, designed for Joomla.  Acquaintance with this component happened in the search for alternatives to Virtuemart, at that moment there were many alternatives: RedShop, Xenmart, Joomshopping.  Joomshopping is a convenient, simple, free component that allows you to have a good store with an assortment of up to 50,000 - 70,000 items.  Perhaps more.  But it was not possible to work with such magazines. <br><br>  <b>Benefits of Joomshopping?</b>  <b>Why did you choose him?</b> <br><br>  Joomshopping is a very flexible and very expandable store.  The program code is written in such a way that virtually any aspect of the store can be changed by using plug-ins.  Also, this component was well popularized on the Joomla forum and the developers listened quite well to the advice, fixed the errors found and implemented the suggestions.  Joomshopping quickly developed taking into account the wishes of the users themselves, later he very quickly reached the level of Virtuemart.  Under it began to write extensions, payment plugins, extensions for SEO, and marketing tools. <br><br>  It is the simplicity and structuredness of the code in Joomshopping that gives it tremendous advantages in the use and formation of a very wide range of applications from a simple catalog to a store with a large load. <br><br>  Joomshopping has a fairly simple interface, sometimes even too simple and a bit outdated.  There are lots of free extensions, but they are not very functional.  A rather extensive community of developers who have experience in developing specialized solutions for individual needs of customers based on Joomshopping, as well as developers who sell ready-made extensions for Joomshopping, has been formed.  There is also a fairly active forum and many people who are ready to suggest how to make or help find the necessary solution. <br><br>  <b>What extensions and add-ons are needed for a full-fledged store on JoomShopping?</b> <br><br>  JoomShopping is a free shop, but this magic word is always misleading to begin online shopping.  In general, consider an online store any, not only ZhSh, it is worth as well as a regular store.  When you plan to open a store, you have a lot of questions, from repairs and wallpapers that need to be glued to placing windows and counters so that the customer is comfortable to look at and select a product.  And of course to arrange cash services in such a way that the client can pay as conveniently for him, quickly and without leaving anything extra taken at the cash register. <br><br>  Naturally there is a certain set of required "masthav" extensions.  It may be different for different stores, but there are key ones. <br><br>  Any store should have: <br><br><ul><li>  convenient basket, </li><li>  quick order, </li><li>  ordering on one page, </li><li>  necessary payment and delivery plugins, </li><li>  If the store has a large assortment of goods is needed filter </li></ul><br>  These are required extensions.  And with respect to Joomshopping, they are almost all paid.  There are free ones, but they are not as functional as modern approaches to trade require. <br><br>  The component template for the front of the site is simple, it is both a plus and a minus.  On the one hand, it is simple-minded in appearance - a minus, but on the other hand, it‚Äôs very simple to customize (customizing) - a plus. <br><br>  <b>In conclusion, what would you say to people who decided to make an online store at Joomshopping?</b> <br><br>  Joomshopping is quite a powerful and developing component for Joomla.  You can safely start your online store at its base, and you can definitely return the time and effort invested.  This is a guaranteed payback option for your e-shop, provided you have enough attention to it. <br><br><h2>  Articles and interesting news Joomla </h2><br><img alt="en" src="https://habrastorage.org/storage3/2e2/522/737/2e2522737ec404a9f76047e108dfaea0.gif">  <a href="https://www.joomdev.com/blog/entry/13-reasons-why-to-choose-joomla">13 reasons why you should choose Joomla</a> . <br><br><img alt="en" src="https://habrastorage.org/storage3/2e2/522/737/2e2522737ec404a9f76047e108dfaea0.gif">  <a href="https://www.joomlabeginner.com/blog/tutorials/167-improve-joomla-seo">15 ways to improve SEO on your Joomla site</a> . <br><br><img alt="en" src="https://habrastorage.org/storage3/2e2/522/737/2e2522737ec404a9f76047e108dfaea0.gif">  <a href="https://domains.joomla.org/">Now you can register domains through the service</a> . <br><br><img alt="en" src="https://habrastorage.org/storage3/2e2/522/737/2e2522737ec404a9f76047e108dfaea0.gif">  <a href="https://www.joomshaper.com/blog/one-click-installer-a-faster-way-to-install-joomshaper-templates">JoomShaper switched to the release of templates twice a month</a> , continue to dynamically enrich the functionality of PageBuilder and released the one-click template installation system - when installing the template adds another step, where you can choose to install demo data or not.

I highly recommend it to those who are not fan of any CMS or read it and watch the video in it.  Recommend watching a video about security. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/sySRbJeh_NY" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><h2>  Joomla templates </h2><br>  <a href="https://www.gavick.com/joomla-templates/wedding">Gavick Wedding Theme Template</a> <br><br>  Joomshaper templates: <br><br><ul><li>  <a href="https://www.joomshaper.com/blog/introducing-travus-the-complete-travel-agency-joomla-template">For travel agencies</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://www.joomshaper.com/blog/introducing-konstra-inclusive-construction-website-solution-on-joomla">For construction companies</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://www.joomshaper.com/blog/introducing-giver-a-non-profit-charity-website-template-on-joomla">For charitable organizations</a> </li></ul><br>  <a href="https://www.joomlart.com/joomla/templates/ja-aiga">Multifunctional template JA Aiga</a> <br><br>  <a href="https://yootheme.com/themes/yoko">Yoko</a> - template from Yootheme.
