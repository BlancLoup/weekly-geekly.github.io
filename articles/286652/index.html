  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Crisis is a good time to invest</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Any crisis allows you to earn - not one and not two financiers, investors, demonstrated the validity of this axiom.  And the point is not that ‚Äúit is convenient to catch a small fish in muddy water,‚Äù not at all.  It‚Äôs just that during a crisis there are always people and companies able to adapt to rapidly changing conditions and start earning. <br><br>  The current crisis is no exception.  It is different from everything that has been in Russia up to the present moment, and now most businessmen are at a loss.  However, investment companies and funds continue to invest, because they need to work under all circumstances.  And such companies are looking for where they can invest, having received a certain profit in the future.  It must be remembered that now investors do not panic, but there is confusion and misunderstanding of the situation.  <a href="http://daily.rbc.ru/opinions/business/13/03/2015/550287d59a794796c389c3db">Alexey Girin, managing partner of Starta Capital, is confident</a> that now there are favorable conditions for cooperation for both investors and start-ups. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h3>  New conditions </h3><br>  Now before investors who invest in domestic companies, there are interesting prospects.  For example, it is possible to invest rubles in a domestic company, and then if the company can reach a profitable level, and not only in Russia, the income will be received in dollars.  This is a good way to reduce costs and increase profitability. <br><br>  It is also worth highlighting the possibility of growth for technology start-ups: technologies and industry are more relevant today than ever.  And venture companies, investors, pay attention to technological startups associated with robotics, instrument engineering and other ‚Äúhardware‚Äù.

    <h3>  Investor specialization </h3><br>  Domestic investment funds have become more specialized.  A few years ago, such companies were almost universal.  But now many investors began to work only with a certain category of companies at different stages of development.  For example, Starta Capital invests in companies at the very start of their development, and Almaz Capital invests in companies that already have some results.  Runa Capital has already chosen quite large projects, and the sums invested are large: the bill is already worth millions of dollars. <br><br>  Investors in Russia got the opportunity to interact with each other thanks to the emergence of ‚Äúclub‚Äù systems, including the Skolkovo business angel club, Launch Gurus, StarTrack, Venture Club and other venues.  Here you can get useful information for investments and share your own experience. <br><br>  As you can see, business processes are not blocked, the business is simply changing, investors are looking for where to invest, and companies that would like to receive investments must meet new conditions. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/286652/">https://habr.com/ru/post/286652/</a></p>
