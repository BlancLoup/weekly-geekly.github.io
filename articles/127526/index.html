  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How to make your home "smarter"?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  We all dream of making our life simpler and more comfortable, so that ‚Äúat the request of a pike‚Äù (read ‚Äúat the touch of a button‚Äù) all small household chores are performed for us and, preferably, with the help of smart machines.  In general, the technique has reached the point that "your mother is shown there and there". <br>  Already today, descending in the elevator, you can give the command to warm the interior of your car. ... Now imagine: when you leave work, you program the oven to warm up to 200 degrees with an SMS message, change the conditioner mode, turn on the heated floors for children, and ask the video system Record your favorite TV show in case you get stuck in traffic! <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  "Unreal!" - You say.  ‚ÄúAlready soon!‚Äù We will correct you. <br><br>  Much of the above becomes possible today thanks to the development of Machine-to-Machine technology or, more simply, M2M.

      The meaning of this technology is simple and derives from the name - it allows the machines to exchange information with each other, or transmit it unilaterally.  For this purpose, wireless networks are used - the fastest data transmission channel for today. <br><br>  Recently, the rapid development of M2M in the whole world has become possible due to the spread of mobile communication: more and more people are using smart phones with the ability to connect to the network via GSM and GPRS modules.  The main advantages here are speed and low cost: one saving on cabling is worth something! <br><br>  According to the research company McKinsey &amp; Company, by the end of 2010, the total turnover of the M2M market in the USA, Japan and Western Europe was about 130 billion dollars.  In Russia, this figure is much more modest, however, experts argue that the M2M market of the CIS countries is rapidly gaining momentum.  The technology is actively used in the banking sector (ATM operation), the operational response sphere of special services (‚Äúquick call‚Äù buttons in medicine and law enforcement), the automotive industry (fuel consumption control, anti-theft systems based on GPS navigation) and many other areas of everyday of life.  Immediate goals on the way to ‚Äúsmart‚Äù robotization are automatic control of water meters and electricity in homes. <br><br>  As you understand, dreams about the ‚ÄúSmart House‚Äù will very soon become a reality - it does not take long to wait.  However, without new ideas and approaches, the process of improving the M2M technology can stop progressing and, simply, stop.  The fact is that many have only superficial knowledge about the achievements and discoveries of this sphere.  And this means that the ground has not yet been formed for the mass emergence of brilliant ideas for developments capable of changing our lives for the better. <br><br>  On September 20, the M2M: War of Machines conference will be held in St. Petersburg as part of the Ingria Business Incubator Lead the Way program.  In addition to the presentations by experts on the trends and prospects for the industry, one of the parts of this conference will be devoted to the presentations of projects that successfully apply this technology. <br><br>  We are sure that not all interesting projects from this field have been invited, so we are addressing the proposal to the Habra community: if you yourself are an M2M project developer or know those who are developing them and will be happy to speak at the event - write.  Be sure to contact everyone. <br>  All the others interested in this topic are invited to register (you can right in the comments to this post) and wait for September 20 at 18-00 at the address of Obukhovskoy Defense Avenue, 70/2, Ingria Business Incubator, 1st floor <br><br>  As a result of the event, we will compile an overview of interesting projects, as well as interview their authors.
