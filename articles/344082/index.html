Plus, the task was to ensure maximum disaster recovery in the event that several factory objects were suddenly destroyed. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The main integration solution for the project was the Cisco Meeting Server platform.  This is a software that allows you to combine a large number of participants with different equipment or without it in the framework of virtual negotiations.  And before the customer with this had great difficulty.

      It was like this: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/i6/ph/zv/i6phzvuvvcb-cxuxdcu4jj1e2zk.png"><br><br><h2>  Problems of the "old" HQS infrastructure </h2><br><ol><li>  Total 6 HD ports on the conferencing server.  This is not enough, but expanding them was more expensive than buying a new CMS with great potential. </li><li>  Integration with Lync broke (in the previous integration scheme, Cisco VCS Control server was used as a gateway).  It needed to be restored, but according to the old scheme the price of a single Lync connection to the conference was expensive.  The introduction of Cisco Meeting Server allowed us to rebuild integration with Lync and connect the ‚Äúunlimited‚Äù number of Lync users for free. </li><li>  Old customers of Jabber Video for TelePresence (formerly Tandberg Movi) are no longer evolving.  Therefore, it was necessary to replace them with Cisco Jabber or Lync (optional), especially in view of reducing the cost of connecting a Lync subscriber due to integration via CMS. </li></ol><br>  <b>This is how the infrastructure initially looked:</b> <br><br><ul><li>  CTP MCU 4501 multipoint server with 6 HD or 12 SD video ports </li><li>  CTP VCS Control internal call management server for 10 simultaneous connections </li><li>  CTP VCS Expressway external call control system server for 5 simultaneous connections </li><li>  Cisco TMS VCS control system server with the ability to service up to 25 devices and connect up to 25 Cisco Jabber Movi software clients </li><li>  Video conferencing session recording server CTP VCR 2210. The video terminal subsystem contained four video terminals equipped with a PTZ camera, microphone, display and sound devices.  The subsystem consisted of: Tandberg C40 - 1 pc .;  Tandberg C20 - 3 pcs. </li></ul><br>  The upgrade went smoothly and without snot. <br><br><h2>  results </h2><br>  On the new infrastructure, the customer can hold 3 conferences at the same time (by the number of licenses purchased) for 64 HD subscribers of any type, including glands and links.  Plus, if necessary, you can easily increase the number of such conferences. <br><br>  Who did not want to change the client - remained on Link.  There was an opportunity to connect people via a browser to one-time events - these are counterparties and guest participants.  A virtually unlimited number of connections were added from the side of Link - and in these conferences you can exchange content in both directions without hindrance. <br><br>  Translated all hardware servers to virtual.  Built a fault-tolerant network.  Gateways are now through different telecom operators.  Different data centers with servers, that is, if the operator falls or if one of the data-communication centers falls, the system is operational. <br><br>  By itself, the central node of Cisco Meeting Server is not failover because it is one.  But if it is destroyed, the new routing system will allow holding a conference on old equipment (that is, there will be a limit on the number of participants, but in case of network degradation, it will not be bad).  Plus there are p2p connections in the worst case. <br><br>  Here is the main server node: <br><br><ul><li>  two hardware servers for software Cisco Business Edition 6000M </li><li>  hardware server for Cisco Multiparty Media 410v multipoint conferencing software </li><li>  existing MCU multipoint conference hardware </li><li>  existing VCR recording hardware server. </li></ul><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/om/fk/5x/omfk5xyclzlud_mzsxet6dxinmk.jpeg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/dq/em/w0/dqemw08vstpxx10dn-ul2c-nxa8.jpeg"><br>  <i>Used equipment Cisco UCS C220</i> <br><br>  <b>Software like this:</b> <br><br><ul><li>  CUCM call control server </li><li>  Cisco IM &amp; Presence instant messaging server </li><li>  Cisco Meeting Server Multipoint Conferencing Server </li><li>  servers for communication with external networks of Cisco Expressway-C and Expressway-E </li><li>  Cisco TMS conference planning server. </li></ul><br>  All this is rolled out on virtual machines under VMWare ESXi on the physical servers of the site.  For the organization of fault-tolerant server clusters, standard manufacturer solutions are used. <br><br><h2>  fault tolerance </h2><br>  Fault tolerance is provided primarily for call management systems in the form of CUCM / IMP, Expressway-C and Expressway-E servers.  For multipoint conferencing, the fault tolerance is partial ‚Äî if the Cisco Meeting Server fails, some of its functions are taken over by the Cisco TelePresence MCU 4501 server, and the other part of the functionality (web clients, MS Lync subscribers) disappears before the server is restored.  The main hardware components of hardware (power supplies, hard drives) are backed up.  All server components of the VCS (except for the existing MCU and VCR) are software, installed on virtual machines running VMWare ESXi v5.5 (CMS) or v6.0 (other components). <br><br><br><table><thead><tr><td><br><p>  <strong>Server</strong> </p><br></td><td><br><p>  <strong>Functions SVKS</strong> </p><br></td><td><br><p>  <strong>Apply duplication and redundancy</strong> </p><br></td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><br><p>  Cisco Unified Communications Manager (CUCM) </p><br></td><td><br><p>  Call management. </p><br><p>  Device management. </p><br><p>  Maintaining an address book </p><br></td><td><br><p>  One CUCM server backup with the subscriber role.
