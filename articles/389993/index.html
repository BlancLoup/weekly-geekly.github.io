  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Motorola Brand Returns to Russia</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Hello friends!  As you remember, at the end of September we shared with you great news: the Motorola brand in Russia to be.  And today we are in a hurry to announce new details.  The plants have confirmed that they will ensure the production of the necessary volumes of products, and this means that the first gadgets with the cherished Moto logo will appear on the Russian shelves in February! <br><br> <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/lenovo/blog/270250/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/67b/265/8ed/67b2658ed46e246079437b18185268b9.jpg" alt="image"></a> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  One of the first ‚Äúswallows‚Äù will, of course, be the second generation <b>Moto 360</b> smart watches, which we <a href="http://geektimes.ru/company/lenovo/blog/261384/">announced in September at IFA 2015</a> .  The final cost of hours has not yet been approved, including for all <a href="http://zenrus.ru/">known reasons</a> . <br><br>  Taking this opportunity, we recall what kind of an animal it is.  If the watches of the first generation were produced in one single version, then in the case of the second generation, we already have a gender separation: a 42-mm dial for ‚Äúgirls‚Äù and a 46-mm dial for ‚Äúboys‚Äù.  By the way, if you are a guy, and you do not have a large hand, then the 42-mm model is also made specifically for you, because there are universal and not at all female colors.  The motivation is very simple.  A smart watch is not only a gadget, but also an accessory, so it should look appropriate on your hand.

In the Moto 360, the display occupies more than 70% of the case area, while for many competitors this figure does not even reach 50%.  And this is by no means a measurement from the category ‚Äúlook how cool we are‚Äù.  The fact is that if the ratio is in favor of the screen, and not in favor of the case, then the clock does not visually seem cumbersome. <br><br>  It is not hard to guess that in a 42-millimeter clock it is simply physically impossible to install the same screen as in a 46-millimeter model.  That is why the display diagonal of the ‚Äúbig‚Äù Moto 360 2 is 1.56 inches, and its resolution is 360 by 330 pixels.  The ‚Äúsmall‚Äù Moto 360 2 has other indicators: 1.37 inches and 360 by 325 pixels. <br><br>  The experience of our employees shows that in practice there is no difference in all this - you just need to forget about all these pixels and inches and choose the model that looks better on your hand.  But one thing that can be significant for someone is still there: in 46-millimeter hours a battery with a capacity of 400 mAh, and in 42-millimeter ones - at 300 mAh.  Averaged measurements in the first case suggest 1.5 days of battery life, and in the second - a day. <br><br>  But the rest of the "stuffing" in both versions is completely identical: a quad-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 400 processor with a clock frequency of 1.2 GHz, as well as 4 GB of constant and 512 MB of RAM.  This is more than enough to cheerfully ‚Äúroll over‚Äù the Android Wear operating system and all its many functions. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/df5/4b1/3e0/df54b13e01c546cf8d14c36b7d7da15f.jpg"></div><br>  For news from IFA 2015, you probably remember how we focused on the fact that changing the straps on all Moto 360 2 is very easy and simple: there is a special mount that is easier to show in the photo than to describe in words.  We don‚Äôt yet have detailed information about the supply of various interchangeable straps, but of course we don‚Äôt plan to forget about accessories, just unloading the watch as standard to the market.  Customization is still one of the main ‚Äúchips‚Äù of the Moto 360. <br><br>  The sports version of the Moto 360 has not yet been delivered even to European and American stores, so in Russia it‚Äôs too early to wait, no matter how much you want.  But we are working on it, because there is a demand for such special solutions.  Recall that the sports model is equipped with an additional sensor - GPS-module, and comes with a strap made of soft hypoallergenic material with enlarged holes.  So the skin is easier to "breathe" during workouts. <br><br>  Of course, it would be strange to be limited to Moto 360 2 alone, returning Motorola to the Russian market.  Therefore, we advise to follow further announcements - there will be other interesting news.  And thank you very much for your attention! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/389993/">https://habr.com/ru/post/389993/</a></p>
