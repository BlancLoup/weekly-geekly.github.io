"Internet of Things" - do it yourself</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d4b/975/c00/d4b975c00b3e49e4984d85c9b8d28979.jpg"><br>  A person, who for some reason turned out to be on Saturday morning, November 22, at the Central Telegraph building, would see a very unusual picture: quite a few people gathered at the entrance, on the street.  As one participant <a href="https://twitter.com/ilyautov/status/536040731723698176">noted</a> , the spectacle was somewhat reminiscent of the first day of any iPhone sales.  However, gadgets were not sold here, but rather the opposite - they were created by themselves within the framework of the Intel hackathon, which, in turn, was part of the <a href="http://iotroadshow.intel.com/">Internet of Things Roadshow</a> .  250 people from different cities of Russia registered for the hackathon, which can be considered a record for the event dedicated to the Internet of Things.  Before you - a small report on the past event. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  At the entrance, the first 100 lucky ones got into the hands of Intel Edison motherboards, which were born not so long ago, but have already gained their fans.  The rest received Galileo.  Together with the boards, participants also received a set of <a href="http://www.seeedstudio.com/depot/intel-iot-c-143/">Grove Starter Kit</a> sensors. <br><br>  The event started with <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/intelsoftwareru/intel-developer-zone-42124077">Alexey Igelstrom</a> ‚Äôs <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/intelsoftwareru/intel-developer-zone-42124077">presentation</a> on the Intel¬Æ Developer Zone program for IoT developers. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d9f/063/df9/d9f063df9337441c94cc933119a3c91e.jpg">

      The event's partner was the Skolkovo IT Cluster: <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/VRyzhonkov/iot-challenges-promissing-trends-sk-2015">Vasily Ryzhonkov presented an inspiring presentation</a> on the Internet of things and the forecasts that analysts promise to the <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/VRyzhonkov/iot-challenges-promissing-trends-sk-2015">participants</a> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e04/2c5/929/e042c59293744da692e1d16850451c33.jpg"><br><br>  Next, Matthias Hahn, one of the developers of the <a href="https://software.intel.com/en-us/iot/devkit">Intel¬Æ IoT Dev Kit</a> , <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/intelsoftwareru/intel-iot-dev-kit">conducted an introductory training</a> on working with Galileo and Edison boards. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/939/c85/bef/939c85beff7947dcb54bc33bcc04c1fd.jpg"><br><br>  After the presentations of the organizers and partners, the pitching of ideas began.  The participants had only 1 minute to talk about their project and invite the missing specialists to the team.  Almost all participants came to the hackathon with ready-made project ideas.  In many ways, this was facilitated by a preliminary IoT meet-up, which the Intel¬Æ Developer Zone team held together with Skolkovo a week before the IoT Roadshow.  The meeting was attended by 20 people, 10 teams were formed, which then continued to participate in the hackathon. <br><br>  As a result of speeches and during lunch, the final formation of projects took place.  40 teams have announced projects to work on.  Here is a <a href="https://www.hackerleague.org/hackathons/intel-r-iot-roadshow-v-moskvie/hacks">list of</a> them.  The most interesting things started: working with motherboards, connecting components, working out ideas and creating prototypes using the presented kits from Intel.  During the hackathon, Intel experts actively helped the participants: someone with code, and someone with customization and work, no one was left without help. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d87/2b9/bb5/d872b9bb56534eecaf6eaa1cc461ccc4.jpg"><br><br>  On the second day of the Intel IoT Roadshow hackathon, by 16 o'clock the teams had to complete the creation of a prototype of their device and present it to the judges, who examined them impartially, but in great detail. <br><br>  The final feature and the final presentation was reached by 27 projects that presented prototypes of devices developed during these two days.  Each project was allocated three minutes for a presentation or demonstration of the result and about the same for questions from experts. <br><br>  Most of the projects looked interesting and viable, although not everyone, of course, saw a commercial future.  I would like to highlight the project <a href="https://www.hackerleague.org/hackathons/intel-r-iot-roadshow-v-moskvie/hacks/magic-fridge">Magic Fridge</a> , where the presence or absence of various products in the refrigerator and even the level of liquids in the bottles, as well as <a href="https://www.hackerleague.org/hackathons/intel-r-iot-roadshow-v-moskvie/hacks/idea-saver">Idea Saver</a> , an intelligent wearable device with a simple interface, is determined to quickly fix ideas by creating voice and graphic notes.  The guys not only completed the technical implementation, but also made a prototype of the device. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a0e/d06/5eb/a0ed065eb4be4a33b0c2c48e2e6f8d7a.jpg"><br><br>  I also remember the project <a href="https://www.hackerleague.org/hackathons/intel-r-iot-roadshow-v-moskvie/hacks/simplelamp">Simple Lamp</a> : the light bulb is on a special stand, where the printed circuit board with the Intel Edison is located, as well as several sensitive sensors that determine the impact on the table surface.  Each punch on the table turns the light on or off.  The project caused an incredible stir in the jury, especially considering that he was the last to appear. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/7bd/cf8/8c9/7bdcf88c9d184c09bd6d32366a6e0fa2.jpg"><br><br>  After all the presentations and dinner, the judges retired to the meeting and determined the winners: <br>  <b>First place</b> .  <a href="http://www.hackerleague.org/hackathons/intel-r-iot-roadshow-v-moskvie/hacks/vis-cast">VIS Cast</a> is a device that adds the function of broadcasting an audio stream to a mobile device on any screen, TV, media or DVD player. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/1d9/30c/b52/1d930cb527bd405b95f7e441efc5ed14.jpg"><br><br>  <b>Second place</b> .  <a href="http://www.hackerleague.org/hackathons/intel-r-iot-roadshow-v-moskvie/hacks/ad-line-intieraktivnaia-bieghushchaia-stroka">AD-line</a> is an interactive running line that in real time receives content from the server for display. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/7c1/eb4/55f/7c1eb455fb9a4bb4bfae4a80f38c7f54.jpg"><br><br>  <b>Third place</b> .  <a href="http://www.hackerleague.org/hackathons/intel-r-iot-roadshow-v-moskvie/hacks/univiersalnaia-apparatnaia-platforma-dlia-proiekta-go-plus">Universal hardware platform for the project Go +</a> .  The project involves the creation of a universal hardware platform that can be embedded in any things for use within the concept of the Internet of Things. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/62a/8db/2ce/62a8db2cecd441a9aa8cdcbfc10fae5c.jpg"><br><br>  In addition, a number of projects were awarded special prizes from Intel and Skolkovo: <br><ul><li>  <a href="https://www.hackerleague.org/hackathons/intel-r-iot-roadshow-v-moskvie/hacks/umnyi-kontieinier">Smart container</a> - For the solution of social problems. </li><li>  <a href="https://www.hackerleague.org/hackathons/intel-r-iot-roadshow-v-moskvie/hacks/smart-mirror">Smart Mirror</a> - For originality. </li><li>  <a href="https://www.hackerleague.org/hackathons/intel-r-iot-roadshow-v-moskvie/hacks/umnyi-akvarium">Smart Aquarium</a> - For the solution of an important and understandable problem. </li><li>  <a href="https://www.hackerleague.org/hackathons/intel-r-iot-roadshow-v-moskvie/hacks/magic-fridge">Magic Fridge</a> - For a demonstration of magic with exposure. </li><li>  <a href="https://www.hackerleague.org/hackathons/intel-r-iot-roadshow-v-moskvie/hacks/emap-easy-mesh-and-positioning">EMAP - Easy Mesh And Positioning</a> - Audience Award. </li></ul><br><br>  According to Svetlana Emelyanova (@svetlanagem), marketing manager of the Intel¬Æ Developer Zone and event organizer, ‚ÄúIoT Roadshow is the first step in creating a Russian community of startups in the field of the Internet of Things.  Hackathon members will not be left without support.  We will hold regular meetings, help solve problems, so that the guys manage to implement a truly successful startup project.  Next year we will see many interesting events: the next Intel IoT Roadshow are planned in St. Petersburg and Moscow.  So join the <a href="https://plus.google.com/communities/107421064497139133332">Internet of Things</a> community <a href="https://plus.google.com/communities/107421064497139133332">: startups in G +</a> or <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/1568352470044467/1569771873235860/">IoT Startups on Facebook</a> - communicate with like-minded people and follow the news. ‚Äù <br><br>  Meanwhile, the first meeting of those interested in IoT under the auspices of Intel will be held in St. Petersburg on December 14th.  Registration for the event is <a href="http://intelsoftware.timepad.ru/event/166291/">already open</a> ! <br><br>  A detailed photo report of the Intel¬Æ IoT Roadshow event can be found in the community of the Intel¬Æ Developer Zone on Google+: <br><ul><li>  <a href="https://plus.google.com/photos/100558067996490752053/albums/6086752950293481857">Day 1</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://plus.google.com/photos/100558067996490752053/albums/6086757617259277441">Day 2</a> </li></ul><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/039/b7a/44f/039b7a44fce84f6ea273c4b9c0d83b68.jpg"></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/363679/">https://habr.com/ru/post/363679/</a></p>
