The program uses the NetWrix VideoScape technology, which assigns meta tags to actions and allows you to quickly navigate to the records of specific actions performed by the user.  For example, to understand how a certain event happened, you can simply enter certain information and save yourself from hours of watching a video ‚Äî you can see everything immediately if you specify certain filters. <br><br>  At the same time, it is possible to understand why the user did so - by chance or deliberately.  Video recording even at the lowest quality level allows you to sort out all the actions performed. <br><br>  The separate moment is a tracking of actions of vendors.  For example, you transfer the implementation of part of the administration of the IT infrastructure of another company, respectively, it is important to record the actions performed by its specialists.

      With the help of the program, you can add another level of administrative visibility and actually track the actions of privileged accounts in the most intuitive mode - in video mode.  In fact, the information is presented as clear as possible - here we see that the administrator somewhere in Samara after starting a remote session from home at night changed the access rights for users of a particular OU.  And a record of a specific action of the meta <b>tagging</b> system in the <b>NetWrix VideoScape</b> technology will help you find the <b>settings</b> (for example, launching a specific application or the window title) and receive only relevant information. <br><br>  By the way, it is not necessary to customize the program so that it tracks all user actions.  If you are only interested in working with certain applications, then this is easy to configure at the stage of configuring the observed object. <br><br>  <b>Briefly about the product</b> (we answer the question: ‚Äúshould you read this review further?‚Äù): <br><br>  Let's start with a formal presentation.  NetWrix User Activity Video Reporter is a tool for monitoring user actions (data collection and reporting).  List of product features: <br><ul><li>  Video recording of user actions during both interactive and remote sessions; </li><li>  Collection of session metadata (application names, window headers, etc.) that can be used for filtering and searching data inside video recordings; </li><li>  Ability to customize recording sizes (recording actions of specific users and applications; setting recording quality); </li><li>  Reports (in the form of tables and diagrams) on user actions with extensive sorting and filtering capabilities; </li><li>  The function of the subscription to receive reports - automatically receive reports by email; </li><li>  Integration with the audit system NetWrix Change Reporter Suite allows you to see how a specific change was made (a bunch of ‚Äúproduct that captures the change - the video‚Äù); </li><li>  The ‚ÄúNetWrix Console Audit‚Äù allows you to track any actions performed using the NetWrix Management Console and track changes made to the configuration of NetWrix software modules, monitored objects and global settings. </li></ul><br><br><h4>  Product operation </h4><br><br>  Data collection and generation of reports based on them is as follows: <br><ul><li>  The administrator configures the observed objects and sets the parameters for automatic video recording; </li><li>  NetWrix User Activity Video Reporter monitors computers and records user activities.  Videos are stored in a local directory called ‚ÄúAudit Archive‚Äù; </li><li>  The program sends to the mail the Activity Summaries reports to those recipients who were selected at the stage of product configuration (item 1); </li><li>  When the ‚ÄúReports‚Äù function is enabled and configured, the data is imported from Audit Archive to the SQL database.  Reports can be viewed through the NetWrix Enterprise Management Console or browser. </li></ul><br>  The product, as already written above, is integrated into the console.  About the console itself and its capabilities we will not write here, those interested are referred to the <a href="http://www.netwrix.com/ru/download/documents/NetWrix_User_Activity_Video_Reporter_Administrator_Guide.pdf">Administrator Guide</a> or <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/netwrix/blog/141630/">Habr√© review</a> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/023/e6a/cbe/023e6acbeeccb368202573afd81fcd36.png"><br><br><h4>  Product setup </h4><br><br>  The configuration process itself is quite simple, so we also briefly denote it.  Product setup begins with the appointment of the observed object. <br>  1. As an observable object, select ‚ÄúComputer Collection‚Äù <br>  2. Set the account that will be used by default for data collection; <br>  3. Set the SMTP server settings; <br>  4. Set the name of the collection of computers; <br>  5. Set SQL Server settings (for generating reports) (by the way, there is an automatic installation and configuration feature for a new instance of SQL Server Express Edition) <br>  6. After that, add items to the collection. <br>  The item type is Windows Server. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/1fe/93b/582/1fe93b582e3a70075a0195880c71f265.png"><br><br>  There are several options to add (computer name, AD container, IP address range, export from a .csv file) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/7d4/ba4/50f/7d4ba450fb2ee3c00bc92dec9bdf4a0f.png"><br><br>  7. We specify the users whose actions will be monitored (all, selectively, deleted) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/280/bc2/670/280bc2670e819d0fb7522fc89324c280.png"><br><br>  8. Set the sending of reports <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/92e/ba5/16f/92eba516f716e7063a97a76b733b0504.png"><br><br>  As you can see, you can receive reports quite often, which will allow you to respond quickly. <br><br>  9. Finish the configuration. <br><br><h4>  We work with the program </h4><br><br>  Access to the program settings is provided from the NetWrix Management Console.  Expand the <b>Managed Objects - &lt;your Managed_Object_name&gt; node</b> and select <b>User Activity Video Tracker</b> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/6ed/f14/8f7/6edf148f718c3e4f78e770abc033a749.png"><br><br>  What can be customized: <br><ul><li>  Users </li><li>  Applications </li><li>  Video Recording (Video Recording) </li><li>  Sending reports (Activity Summary Delivery) </li></ul><br><br><h4>  Users </h4><br><br>  Clicking on the ‚Äú <i>Specify Users ...</i> ‚Äù button opens a dialog box asking you to select users whose actions you want to monitor. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/95a/8bf/763/95a8bf7630c9a04bd35fb0357061ca36.png"><br><br><h4>  Applications </h4><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/3b7/8f7/ca6/3b78f7ca659808a2a3de971a73557937.png"><br><br>  In the event that we track individual applications, you will need to set their names. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/4ee/b83/b61/4eeb83b61dbe699cd50b603c8e56c954.png"><br><br><h4>  Video Settings </h4><br><br>  We set the video quality, recording duration and storage of recordings. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/318/1a3/b27/3181a3b27947ceaee2b953d158b37a29.png"><br><br><h4>  Sending reports </h4><br><br>  We set the address of the recipient and the frequency of sending reports <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/f18/44c/db6/f1844cdb689f2d8435ae205319a7f4ee.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/1b8/c3c/ae7/1b8c3cae7bef61e0452197c74b285606.png"><br><br>  Sample report in the mail <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/131/531/683/1315316832d7de64e510d27db075ae5c.jpg"><br><br>  By clicking on the link (in the Start Time column) video recording opens. <br><br><h4>  Monitored computers </h4><br><br>  The <b>Monitored Computers</b> console node allows you to check and manage the statuses of agents installed on the computers being monitored. <br>  Access ( <b>Managed Objects - &lt;your Managed_Object_name&gt; - User Activity Video Reporter - Monitored Computers</b> ). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/f74/d38/7e7/f74d387e775fb90b50e6998ade3516da.png"><br><br><h4>  Action Records </h4><br><br>  The <b>Activity Records</b> page gives access to video recordings;  filtering is set by you.  Access to them - ( <b>Managed Objects - &lt;Your Managed_Object_name&gt; - User Activity Video Reporter - Activity</b> ) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/251/960/917/25196091739a7547bde7651954c8b8e7.png"><br><br>  As we can see, there are plenty of filters: <br><ul><li>  Period of time </li><li>  Computer </li><li>  User </li><li>  Applications </li><li>  Window title </li></ul><br><br>  Adjust the filters and click Generate Summary <br>  As an example, consider the Activity Records report: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/e13/666/f78/e13666f784ab3b047feab0bab4390a36.jpg"><br><br>  From the console, you can immediately see how a certain action was carried out.  Video can be saved. <br><br><h4>  Reports </h4><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/000/f1c/e6f/000f1ce6fbbc14c5230a6ae8577b0645.jpg"><br><br>  In version 1.0, five reports are currently available. <br>  Take for example the report ‚Äú <i>All Users Activity</i> ‚Äù. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/807/939/365/807939365520f592100cd162e1e4413a.png"><br><br>  Set up the filters and finally get this report. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/b23/7ca/378/b237ca3789844c1f329b72acdac40912.jpg"><br><br>  By clicking on the date, the video action is opened. <br><br><h4>  NetWrix Console Audit </h4><br>  This option allows you to track changes made to monitored objects, NetWrix program configurations and global console settings. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/454/3fc/a4c/4543fca4c47cf001e95e2c0c983930bb.png"><br><br>  By clicking on the <b>Configure</b> button, an observable object is created that is similar to that described at the program setup stage. <br><br>  The program can be viewed in a short video. <br><iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/qy9qaV3pQzs%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700002,15700022,15700186,15700191,15700253,15700256&amp;usg=ALkJrhino8FTkwNIa_XFC61NC1c-BY9KmA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><h4>  Use the free version productively. </h4><br>  The program is available as usual in two versions - <a href="http://www.netwrix.com/ru/server_auditing_tool.html">basic free and extended commercial</a> .  And the main limitation that exists in the free version is that the video recording of user actions stops after 30 minutes of working with the application.  It would seem that such a restriction negates the existence of the free version.  However, pay attention to the fact that the video recording can start when you start a certain application and even the title of the window.  Take the example of working with SalesForce.  We are interested in the user's access to this site and actions with it. <br>  In the Applications section, add the Application Description * (or you can specify the browser that your users use), but specify the window title (Window Title) as * salesforce *.  You can go further and refine the appeal to a specific element of the site, for example, to a specific report, for example, ‚ÄúLeads Daily ~ salesforce *‚Äù, in order to get only the video recording of work with it.  Taking into account that the user does not sit around this report all the time, but periodically opens it during the day, 30 minutes will be quite enough to track activity during the day. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/3b7/8f7/ca6/3b78f7ca659808a2a3de971a73557937.png"><br><br>  And this is just one example.  You can, of course, come up with other options for using the program for tracking activity, based on the specifics of the work of your users. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/168349/">https://habr.com/ru/post/168349/</a></p>
