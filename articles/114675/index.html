  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Post-production for iOS applications: how to make a quality video presentation</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  I suspect that so many software developers for the iPhone / iPad will be just happy to read this post. <br>  I have been using Apple's gadgets for quite a while and regularly review thematic resources for reviews of various applications.  And to be honest, I am very annoyed by video reviews that are not made with a very high-quality camera and it is clearly visible that they are done unprofessionally. <br>  Of course, when the development budget is small, then a high-quality video clip is a luxury to write into the cost item.  Today I will tell you how to make a high-quality video presentation application for iDevaysov. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  I'll tell you in order.  A few days ago, I tried to videotape the work of my application, the development of which I already wrote on Habr√©.  I tried to shoot and holding the iPhone in my hands, and putting it on the table, but the result was just dismal.  In the viewfinder, the camera looked good, but only I transferred the video to the computer - I immediately wanted to cry.  Moire, poor sharpness, brightness jumps, etc.  This option did not suit me at all. <br><br>  And I began to dig in the direction of recording video directly on the device.  It is obvious that nothing useful was found in the AppStore, and I climbed into Cydia.  There were 3 applications: ScreenRecorder, Display Recorder and ScreenSplitr. <br>  ScreenRecorder - did not work, because it had a real frame rate of about 3 per second, and this is very bad for video. <br>  Display Recorder - I just didn‚Äôt start because I only needed iPhone 3Gs. <br>  ScreenSplitr is a solution for application presentations; it, together with an application for Mac OS X or Windows, iDemo displays on the computer screen everything that happens on the interface.  But often he has very low updates (works through a very slow VNC), so he immediately refused this idea. <br><br>  And now, the circle closed.  The device is not written, but the outside is somehow not beautiful. <br>  And when I was almost ready to give up, I found IT.  As they say: victory always comes one step before defeat.

    <h4>  THIS </h4><br>  And the casket opened simply.  One good man named David Beck has written a plugin for the iPhone Simulator, which records video from the simulator screen in real time, and prepares it very well for further use.  And this is not even all of its functions. <br><br>  Installation is extremely simple.  Well, firstly, it is necessary that the application you are shooting be compiled and installed in the iPhone Simulator.  If you do not have source codes, then it will not be so easy, but I think if it is good to dig in the internet, then you can even run the ipa file in the simulator. <br><br>  Next, download these two files. <br><br>  <a href="">SIMBL-0.9.9.zip</a> or <a href="">Mirror SIMBL-0.9.9.pkg</a> <br><br>  <a href="">iPhone-Simulator-Capture.zip</a> or <a href="">Mirror iPhone-Simulator-Capture.pkg</a> <br><br>  The first file is the mechanism for plug-ins in the iPhone Simulator, and the second is the same recorder. <br><br>  When the installation is finished, launch iPhone Simulator, and the Recording item should appear in its menu. <br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/23c/a4f/494/23ca4f494916dbc2a67a73afafd8d88c.png" alt="image"></div><br>  Immediately go to the Preferences and adjust what you need.  Particularly noteworthy button Install Fake Apps.  Very useful button.  She adds to the Spring Board all the standard application icons that are on iDevice.  Well, to look more beautiful. <br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/6b2/af7/ecb/6b2af7ecb73c531ae167e5a969c8bc90.png" alt="image"></div><br><br>  And then everything is simple - start Recording, press the red button, and when you finish - save the video. <br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ead/121/590/ead12159055583562fd8e7af240af16b.png" alt="image"></div><br>  The video is saved in mov QuickTime format.  Then you can do anything with it.  The quality is just super.  You can even record with Retina - then you can output a 1080 to a projector - it will not be a shame. <br><br>  Then I did the video processing in Adobe Premiere, put in a sound, added a background music.  And you can look at the result.  It all took about 3 hours of work (given the fact that I practically do not know how to work with video) <br>  Video in HD 720 format - so you can see all the details. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/1c05JqLI6HU%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,1500003,15700021,15700186,15700190,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhgH532oTiW6HpJztVlRePdIPYVfAw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/114675/">https://habr.com/ru/post/114675/</a></p>
