I remind you that the conditions are very simple: you leave a request for your project, we analyze it in detail and publish it after a while. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/915c1a11/d096984e/d13e53a6/667256bd.png" align="left">  In just a couple of days, 20 applications arrived, which is, in principle, a great success of the project - given the traditional desire for secrecy among our person and, especially, our entrepreneur. <br><br>  This week, as promised, we will publish the first Lynch.  Why the first?  First, to fit all 20 applications with comments in one post is unrealistic.  Therefore, we decided to break them into several cycles and lay out parts in two weeks.  Secondly, we hope that this is not the last experience of this kind, and there will still be those who want to get a qualified expertise - the <a href="http://www.facebook.com/FastLaneVentures%3Fsk%3Dapp_163337280400612">application form still works</a> .  The authors of all applications will receive a mail notification of the status of the consideration of the application and whether it will be published.

      For the first publication, we chose the most complete and informative applications in those areas of the Internet business, where Fast Lane Ventures has more experience.  They were five projects: <br><ol><li>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/fastlaneventures/blog/124224/">Regional</a> resume <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/fastlaneventures/blog/124224/">sites</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/fastlaneventures/blog/124224/">Selloby</a> - a mobile service and free classifieds website for sale, purchase, job search, rental housing and dating </li><li>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/fastlaneventures/blog/124224/">Sanviz 3D</a> - a program for visualizing tiles of various designs for bathrooms </li><li>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/fastlaneventures/blog/124224/">Carmio.ru</a> - an online service for calculating and comparing retail insurance products </li><li>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/fastlaneventures/blog/124224/">Znauvse.info</a> - a project that provides free answers to all questions by SMS </li></ol><br>  The structure of comments is simple: application (spelling and punctuation of the original), pros, cons, general conclusion and answer to the sacramental question - is Fast Lane Ventures ready to give money to this project?  Useful reading for all who have or who are just preparing to launch their own startup.  Well, just for everyone interested in the topic. <br><br>  So, let's go: <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><a name="1"></a><h4>  <b>The first</b> </h4><br>  <b>Regional sites for posting summaries</b> - the project aims at a niche in which large portals are poorly represented: regional sites with job openings ‚Äúfor the people‚Äù.  The business model involves monetization by micropayments and advertising. <br><br><h6>  Describe your project in one or two sentences. </h6><br>  Regional sites for placing vacancies and summaries "for the people" and not "Moscow's top managers." <br><br><h6>  What is the business model of the project, how will the revenue be generated? </h6><br>  1. Micropayments of SMS services (raise an ad, highlight in color, fasten at the top) <br>  2. Sale of banner advertising, 200-4000 $ from a regional site per month, depending on the penetration of the influence of the Internet in a particular region. <br><br><h6>  Who are the customers, why will they use your project? </h6><br>  - Recruitment agencies, personnel departments of organizations. <br>  - People in search of work. <br><br>  Large job search sites rarely contain job advertisements for cashiers, salesmen, porters, drivers, etc.  This is especially true for the regions.  People need a ‚Äúnative‚Äù regional platform, where they do not need to fill out 10 steps of the form, pay for registration or viewing.  Where there will be no spam and work associated with network marketing. <br><br><h6>  Who are the partners, suppliers, why would they be interested in working with you? </h6><br>  Advertisers are interested in a very clear regional targeting.  There are a lot of regions where our site can get to the top 3 regional sites by attendance, due to the weak development of the Internet in the region.  And there are advertisers and now they have almost no place where they can advertise. <br><br><h6>  How do you see the competitive environment and the market as a whole (the main <br>  competitors, segmentation, total adressable market)? </h6><br>  There are many large job search sites, hh.ru, job.ru, <br>  superjob.ru, rabota.mail.ru and others, but all of them are united by a small <br>  concentration on regions.  In fact, they are not even competitors, we have another <br>  niche vacancies and resumes. <br><br><h6>  Why is your project better than existing competitors? </h6><br>  - Most often they have paid access to the resume database, posting vacancies. <br>  we have free <br>  - Sophisticated forms of registration and adding data that scare ordinary users <br>  - On sites below the level, a bunch of spam and duplicates, ads to another city.  We have an analysis of duplicates, a block against spam, and algorithms for a ban that periodically violate the rules of users. <br>  - At sites below the level there are no helping functions, selection of suitable vacancies / resumes, mailings according to given parameters <br><br><h6>  Describe the development plan for one year and the strategy for the next 2-3 years. </h6><br>  - Development of functional <br>  - Writing a system that allows you to check each ad by other people for a fee (the analogy is how the Chinese recognize the captcha). <br>  - Improving the morphological recognition of duplicate ads <br>  - Start advertising the site in each region <br><br><h6>  How much time and money is needed to develop, before the project has the first client? </h6><br>  The project has already been launched in 23 regions ... it has been working for the third month already (vnwork.ru, vlgwork.ru, jobkir.ru and another 20).  Now the functionality is being added and just yesterday I personally drew a new design. <br>  <a href="">vnwork.ru/VNwork1.png</a> <br>  <a href="">vnwork.ru/VNwork2.png</a> <br>  <a href="">vnwork.ru/VNwork4.png</a> <br><br>  The first clients already exist, totally in 23 regions without any advertising at all: <br>  3000 unique visitors, the average depth of viewing 8 pages. <br>  3500 - registered users <br>  5000 vacancies <br>  1000 resumes <br><br>  What do we need: <br>  - We need marketing advice and marketing financing itself (we are developing every day - but not as fast as we would like) <br>  - 2 programmers, with a salary of 15-20 thousand rubles <br>  - 1 designer with a salary of 15-20 thousand rubles <br>  - content managers, for manual moderation of "dangerous" ads <br><br><h6>  What are the main achievements of team members and how are these achievements <br>  will help your project succeed? </h6><br>  There are two programmers in the team.  We draw, typeset, program, design interfaces, analyze user behavior, statistics, analyze the market, communicate with advertisers.  Do everything <br>  yourself - not because we do it perfectly, but because there is no money for hiring employees, but I want to work and earn money.  But it turns out not so bad ... We are two - but we are talented. <br><br>  The first version is running, albeit damp but already fully working.  The idea that people need regional platforms is proven!  For a month now we have been developing the functionality that users need. <br><br><h5>  <b>Summary of our analyst:</b> </h5><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/51001ff6/e1845213/530fae75/e93cbebf.png">  With proper execution, niche projects can be very substantial. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/51001ff6/e1845213/530fae75/e93cbebf.png">  The global success of online classifieds and the departure from traditional print formats. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/d9da1edb/df50d50b/53a69e1f/6c254b3c.png">  All Russian HR portals are targeting regions and small cities. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/d9da1edb/df50d50b/53a69e1f/6c254b3c.png">  Care in the regions and low-level vacancies are two steps away from a paying client. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/d9da1edb/df50d50b/53a69e1f/6c254b3c.png">  The monetization of 95% of hr-portals is based on the ‚Äúemployer pays‚Äù model; leaving this model requires careful justification. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/d9da1edb/df50d50b/53a69e1f/6c254b3c.png">  Advertising on a similar portal will be difficult to sell due to the peculiarities of the target audience, which does not differ in its solvency and the desire to buy something while looking for a job. <br><br>  The main question is why large portals are poorly represented in this segment: because they are cumbersome, and do not have time to do everything, or because the niche is unpromising and has no income?  What do they need to do in order to start competing in this niche?  Also, understanding is needed of how the ‚Äúvacancies‚Äù that you are targeting are closing in - most likely without the help of the Internet. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/dea2126d/cf4e8a3c/8821762b/dacccaea.png">  <i>Fast Lane Ventures: do not invest - in the case of a successful project, the absolute amount of revenue will be small.</i>  <i>If you want to interest an angel or an institutional investor, the project must have a good revenue potential - from several million dollars in two to three years.</i> <br><br><a name="2"></a><h4>  <b>Second</b> </h4><br>  <b>Selloby</b> - This project combines ‚Äúverticals‚Äù of classifieds, rentals, dating and job search in a mobile application. <br><br><h6>  Describe your project in one or two sentences. </h6><br>  Selloby is a social mobile service and free classifieds website for sale, purchase, job search, rental housing and dating. <br><br><h6>  What is the business model of the project, how will the revenue be generated? </h6><br>  The project will be monetized at the second stage, after the formation of a permanent user base.  Planned paid package accommodation for legal entities - car dealerships, travel agencies, shops, <br>  employers / employment agencies.  There are options for paid promotion of ads - raising in the tape, the inclusion in the followings of users. <br><br><h6>  Who are the customers, why will they use your project? </h6><br>  Socially active young people 20-35, users of Facebook and Twitter, students, young families with average incomes. <br><br><h6>  Who are the partners, suppliers, why would they be interested in working with you? </h6><br>  Service exists independently, does not require back office, financial support.  With a successful launch and dynamic development, a growing user base will attract partners (see p.2) to instantly and inexpensively alert / attract a large number of potential customers. <br><br><h6>  How do you see the competitive environment and the market as a whole (the main <br>  competitors, segmentation, total adressable market)? </h6><br>  The project is focused on all markets - USA, Europe, Russia.  In the USA, the main competitors are Craiglist, eBay Classifieds, Oodle + many small services that do not have a large base.  Craiglist's flaw is outdated design and functionality, lack of mobile services, a high percentage of spam and fraud, advantages - a huge user base, 15-year history.  In Russia - the only active resource Avito - 100,000 ads per day on the site. <br><br><h6>  Why is your project better than existing competitors? </h6><br>  Selloby exists for iPhone, Android, WP7, there is a full-featured website Selloby is built on the principle of twitter - quick short ads are written using hashtags and sadzhestov, instant photo taking and / or posting photos from the library <br>  The ability to remain anonymous - important for employment or job search <br>  Sharing ads via FB and Tw <br>  Default geolocation <br>  Custom system of followings <br>  Instant spam blocking - not an ad is blocked, but <br>  spammer <br>  Convenient messenger - correspondence with each user is conducted in the very <br>  application in a separate thread <br>  No premoderation <br><br><h6>  Describe the development plan for one year and the strategy for the next 2-3 years. </h6><br>  By the end of 2011, to launch a product in the markets of Russia and the USA, by means of PR and marketing tools, gain the maximum number of users - target 1M users.  Release at least two updated product versions + service for iPad <br><br>  Next two years <br>  - increasing user base <br>  - in 2013 - monetization of services <br><br><h6>  How much time and money is needed to develop, before the project has the first client? </h6><br>  The product is 100% ready to launch.  The creation took 3 months, $ 50,000 <br><br><h6>  What are the main achievements of team members and how will these achievements help your project succeed? </h6><br>  Pelevin Alexey - ux-designer, founder of design studio PARK, founder of Technopark and Parcsis <br>  Ilona Isupova - CEO, Project Manager, ex-owner of an online store, experience in e-commerce, PR, marketing <br><br>  Experience successful projects: <br>  Legal Reference System PRAVO.RU <br>  Card file of Arbitration Affairs kad.arbitr.ru <br>  On-line service to buy tickets and hotels on anywayanyday.com <br>  The site of the insurance company Renaissance Renins.com <br><br><h5>  <b>Summary of our analyst:</b> </h5><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/51001ff6/e1845213/530fae75/e93cbebf.png">  The project is not beaten and timely - it was recently too early, and soon it will be too late. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/51001ff6/e1845213/530fae75/e93cbebf.png">  Geo-targeting provides great opportunities for classifications. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/d9da1edb/df50d50b/53a69e1f/6c254b3c.png">  Lack of focus killed more than one project. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/d9da1edb/df50d50b/53a69e1f/6c254b3c.png">  Running a service from scratch in five areas complicates the two-sided problem five times: for each area you need to create a critical mass of users. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/d9da1edb/df50d50b/53a69e1f/6c254b3c.png">  It is extremely difficult to make a mobile application that brings money.  Through the small screen of the phone it is difficult to transfer content and create user convenience for which he is willing to pay. <br><br>  Klassifaydy - this is a complex business model, extremely demanding to the execution skills.  First you need to build a product that users will like, and then monetize it.  Russia has already managed to make classifications successful from a user point of view, but there is no success story from the point of view of money yet. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/dea2126d/cf4e8a3c/8821762b/dacccaea.png">  <i>Fast Lane Ventures: we will not invest - at the heart of the project there is no proven business model</i> <br><br><a name="3"></a><h4>  <b>Third</b> </h4><br>  <b>Sanviz 3D</b> is a program for visualizing tiles of various designs for bathrooms of standard layout, designed to help sellers of offline stores sell more efficiently. <br><br><h6>  Describe your project in one or two sentences. </h6><br>  A simple program for 3D visualization of the bathroom.  In building hypermarkets, a person fits a stand, draws his bathroom in 3D in one minute and selects an interesting design for him.  If you liked <br>  prints the estimate and goes to pay at the cashier with a forerunner.  The program monitors the balance and in case of shortage sends a request for delivery to the dealer.  Here is a video presentation <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DDo_ByLKYAzU">www.youtube.com/watch?v=Do_ByLKYAzU</a> <br><br><h6>  What is the business model of the project, how will the revenue be generated? </h6><br>  The percentage of paid precursors is taken.  Money is taken from the tile manufacturer. <br><br><h6>  Who are the customers, why will they use your project? </h6><br>  Tile manufacturers, ceramic tile dealers.  They will use it because they are still paying so that their stands with tiles stand in passable rows.  And the new booth will attract attention and <br>  increase sales.  Plus, you can get operational information about sales, quickly adjust prices and keep track of stock balances.  The cost of the stand is comparable to the existing expozitor. <br><br><h6>  Who are the partners, suppliers, why would they be interested in working with you? </h6><br>  Ceramic tile manufacturers.  Interested in new "chips" to increase sales.  Now sellers in stores do 3D visualization manually, and we will make it so that buyers themselves will do 3D visualization.  And it will be available only for the ceramic tiles of our partners.  If the stand increases sales by at least 1%, then the manufacturer‚Äôs sales will increase by millions of rubles. <br><br><h6>  How do you see the competitive environment and the market as a whole (the main <br>  competitors, segmentation, total adressable market)? </h6><br>  3D tile visualization programs are competitive, but in boutique sales segments.  Our product is focused on hypermarkets, when the buyer is not paid attention and he is forced to do 3D visualization himself.  At the moment, there are no analogues in Russia.  There are rumors that there is abroad, but there is no evidence.  Now in Russia there are 2 more companies leading work on a similar project. <br><br><h6>  Why is your project better than existing competitors? </h6><br>  1) Company leading development No.1 - they know the market from the inside, but are weak in <br>  technical part.  1 year looking for funding for the project.  We are <br>  a team in which there are also "techies" and <br>  "Sellers". <br>  2) A company that already makes an offline product and that ‚Äústole‚Äù our idea at the tile exhibition.  They have been involved in this area for 5 years and since they have not invented a vector of product development on their own, we will probably generate better ideas and stay ahead of them. <br><br><h6>  Describe the development plan for one year and the strategy for the next 2-3 years. </h6><br>  1st year: the introduction of stands for one manufacturer in all large construction hypermarkets in Russia.  Promotion of the product on the market so that other companies will learn about the new way of promotion. <br>  2-3 year: consolidation of the sales information system, balances for all manufacturers.  Replacing this system with purchasing / sales managers in wholesale companies that monitor the condition <br>  balances in stores and sale. <br><br><h6>  How much time and money is needed to develop, before the project has the first client? </h6><br>  1) For development - 1 million rubles, 6 months. <br>  2) First client - negotiations are underway to purchase a system that has not yet been created. <br>  or creating a joint venture. <br>  Here the main thing is to find a partner before the release of the product. <br><br><h6>  What are the main achievements of team members and how will these achievements help your project succeed? </h6><br>  1) The leader is an entrepreneur (from the word undertake =)), sociable with a good education and an IQ level. <br><br><h5>  <b>Summary of our analyst:</b> </h5><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/51001ff6/e1845213/530fae75/e93cbebf.png">  The task is set very correctly - visualization should not be technically complex and take a lot of time. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/51001ff6/e1845213/530fae75/e93cbebf.png">  Free for the user. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/d9da1edb/df50d50b/53a69e1f/6c254b3c.png">  In my opinion, in the application there is a bias towards the interests of the manufacturer and the seller, which will not remain unnoticed by the buyer. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/d9da1edb/df50d50b/53a69e1f/6c254b3c.png">  Also, the application does not solve many of the issues that the buyer puts before him - as options vary in price, visualization of the individual features of the project, taking into account non-standard dimensions. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/d9da1edb/df50d50b/53a69e1f/6c254b3c.png">  The monetization model requires verification, since  for the revenue share model, you need to convince the seller that the application helps to sell. <br><br>  In this project, the interests of the manufacturer, the store and the buyer are concentrated, and in many cases the success will depend on their proper balance.  Also, in my opinion, the implementation of this model in the format of an online store is promising. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/dea2126d/cf4e8a3c/8821762b/dacccaea.png">  <i>Fast Lane Ventures: we do not invest - since b2b project is not our key focus (80% of projects in the portfolio are focused on the end user) and there is no Internet component in the project.</i> <br><br><a name="4"></a><h4>  <b>Fourth</b> </h4><br>  <b><a href="http://www.carmio.ru/">Carmio.ru</a></b> is an online service for calculating and comparing retail insurance products. <br><br><h6>  Describe your project in one or two sentences. </h6><br>  Carmio.ru is an online service for calculating the cost of various insurance products in various insurance companies in Russia.  The service is designed for quick and easy calculation of insurance and is aimed at both insurance market professionals (insurance brokers, agents) and ordinary users who want to calculate and issue insurance. <br><br><h6>  What is the business model of the project, how will the revenue be generated? </h6><br>  Project business model: <br>  2.1 Sale of licenses for the required period of use of the system for insurance brokers, agents.  The calculation of the cost of a month of use is carried out using a flexible system of discounts depending on the number of licenses required, the number of months ordered and the intensity, which makes the system accessible even to individual agents, and creates large discounts for large brokers. <br>  2.2 Selling insurance to ordinary users who need to insure something.  This is implemented as follows - the client calculates the cost of insurance, if he was interested in the offer, <br>  he leaves a request on the website, or calls the operator, then we redirect the request to our partners who are directly involved in insurance, as a result, the client prepares <br>  insurance from our partners, and we get a certain percentage of the transaction.  In the future we plan to open our own brokerage insurance agency. <br>  2.3 Subscription fee for insurance companies for their presence in the settlement system. <br><br><h6>  Who are the customers, why will they use your project? </h6><br>  Our clients are insurance brokers, agents who every day need to calculate insurance costs for customers, while spending too much time, because each insurance company has its own calculator for calculating insurance, as a result, to calculate, for example, 15 companies You must have 15 different calculators.  With the help of Carmio.ru service such a calculation can be done in just 1 - 2 minutes.  Also, customers may be ordinary users who need to insure a car or any other type of insurance. <br><br><h6>  Who are the partners, suppliers, why would they be interested in working with you? </h6><br>  The partners of our project are, first of all, insurance companies, because this is a direct advertisement of their services, we introduce their tariffs, methods into our service, as a result, users calculate insurance and subsequently acquire insurance policies.  Also at the initial stage, a large insurance broker acts as a partner for consulting and identifying the needs and necessary functionality of the service. <br><br><h6>  How do you see the competitive environment and the market as a whole (the main <br>  competitors, segmentation, total adressable market)? </h6><br>  Our service competitors are companies that have implemented their settlement systems for 3 types of insurance: CASCO, CTP, Green Card.  But the difference is that our service will be much more functional and offers the consumer a wider range of possibilities for calculation.  This is the calculation of insurance for Personal Protection, VHI, Mortgage insurance, Tourism, etc. for various insurance companies. <br><br><h6>  Why is your project better than existing competitors? </h6><br>  Carmio.ru - will be the first project in runet, with which you can simultaneously calculate several different insurance products.  To date, there is not a single service in RuNet with such functionality.  We plan to make it possible to calculate insurance not only for well-known types of insurance CASCO, OSAGO, Green Card, but also for other types - LCA, personal protection, mortgage insurance in various insurance companies.  Those projects that are now implemented on the Internet are sites that offer to calculate insurance and at the end of the calculation they need to leave contact details so that you can contact the client and offer him services.  The difference of our project is that we do not require any contact information, the client, after calculating insurance with our system, sees the results of the calculation, and already decides whether the price suits him or not.  Also, the main difference between our calculation system and the existing ones is that we have implemented the maximum possible number of parameters for the calculation, which is the main advantage.  After all, the service is aimed at insurance market professionals - brokers, for whom the use of such a system will help reduce the time for calculating insurance, and consequently increase labor productivity. <br><br><h6>  Describe the development plan for one year and the strategy for the next 2-3 years </h6><br>  Development strategy of the project: Registration as a legal entity, search for premises for a company, refinement of the necessary functionality, organization of a large-scale advertising project company, search <br>  partner clients from insurance companies, processing applications from users for the purchase of insurance.
