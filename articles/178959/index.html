We will talk about the most obvious of them: what will happen if you intervene in the course of history?  There are several options for how the flow of time responds to the actions of the traveler from the future.  These models can be seen in science fiction films, more and more scientists are beginning to talk about them, but which model is closer to the truth - there is no consensus yet.  We are just beginning to penetrate the secrets of time, and still do not have the opportunity to experiment with movements into the past.  What can be clarified in this matter now?  Under the cut we will have a tour of the basics of the mechanics of time, we will discuss paradoxes, and we will conduct a small experiment.  Yes, it will be a test of a virtual time machine built on the basis of the Life algorithm! <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/150300/">Previous article of the</a> cycle. <br><br>  If you suddenly have not heard anything about the grandfather's paradox, its essence is as follows: the happy owner of the MW flies into the past, and by his actions interferes with his own appearance into the world.  For example, interferes with the acquaintance of their parents.  In the new version of the story the traveler is absent, there is no his flight into the past - it means that the story does not change.  But then the traveler will still be born, and as a result will fly into the past ... - a vicious circle of mutually exclusive conditions, which is why this is called a paradox. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/9a9/bfe/99d/9a9bfe99d52c286733c54a68eabc7dcb.jpg"><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Note</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  I think everyone understands that the emergence of a paradox is not tied to either the poor grandfather or to erasing himself from history.  A traveler may simply ask a young man not to invent a time machine (yeah, he listened so!).  Or send a note ‚Äúdo not send a note‚Äù for 5 minutes to the past.  The essence is the same: the result of the flight in the past is the cancellation of this flight in the past. </div></div><br>  The paradox exists only as our misunderstanding of how time works.  Surely nature does not allow the emergence of paradoxes, but how?  Consider the basic models of time, noting their pros and cons.

    <h4>  Models </h4><br><br><h5>  Model 1: the impossibility of time travel </h5><br>  <b>Essence: the</b> laws of nature prohibit movement into the past, completely, or with any serious limitations.  There are several variations on this topic: <br><ul><li>  Moving into the past is not possible in principle. </li><li>  Moving into the past, or at least its serious change, leads to the rupture of the fabric of space-time, the collapse of the Universe and other total cataclysms </li><li>  Moving, say, 1 year into the past, the traveler will be at a distance of 1 light year from Earth, and will be able to reach the starting point only at the time of his flight back - thereby, without being able to influence himself in the past (i.e. does not close the ring). </li></ul><br>  <b>Pros: the</b> triviality of the solution.  The easiest way to resolve the paradox is to exclude the conditions for its occurrence from the sphere of the possible. <br>  <b>Minuses:</b> what about the time machine?) Seriously, the fundamental possibility of time travel is too vast a topic to talk about now, so consider what else we have left, hoping that they are still possible . <br><br><h5>  Model 2: Predetermined History </h5><br><blockquote>  ‚ÄúAt that moment he realized that he was the same Joe.  Joe, whom he had already met before.  It was as if lightning suddenly dawned in Bob‚Äôs head the fact that it was not just the same situation that he himself had passed through, but that was exactly the situation.  Only now he perceived it from another point of view. ‚ÄùR. Heinlein‚Äú On the heels ‚Äù. <br></blockquote><br>  <b>The bottom line:</b> flying back in time is possible, but there‚Äôs nothing to change, since the pages of the story are fixed.  If archaeologists have found evidence that you have visited Akhenaten in ancient Egypt, this flight will surely take place, and this will take place exactly as it was in the past.  You can perform other actions there, or simply refuse to fly - due to some circumstances you cannot. <br>  Hence the conclusion that some points in the story can be created by time travelers.  For example, you decided to prevent the sinking of the Titanic - being on board, or you will encounter a lot of difficulties and will not be able to divert the ship from the iceberg, or you will realize with horror that your actions are the real cause of the disaster. <br>  It is appropriate to distinguish two variants of the model: strong and weak.  Strong predestination implies that it is impossible to change a single detail of the past.  Weak admits the change of small details, but the key points of the story, the general direction of events remain. <br><br>  Obviously, <b>predestination extends not only to the past, but also to the future</b> .  After all, if the past is fixed, and contains events of arrivals of people from the future, the future is also to some extent predetermined, because it must be the circumstances for these flights.  Within the framework of this model, it becomes possible to get a kind of "guarantee of history".  For example, scientists find evidence of a visit to the past by people from the 20th century ‚Äî this means that over the next thousand years, humanity will not only exist, but also actively develop science.  Here it is important not to deviate from the laws of logic and understand that the lack of evidence for such visits absolutely does not prove anything.  ‚ÄúIf time travel is possible, then where our descendants are from the future‚Äù is, you see, not serious, many explanations can be put forward. <br>  <b>Examples: the</b> movie ‚ÄúHunters for the relic‚Äù, the story of R. Heinlein ‚ÄúOn the heels‚Äù. <br>  <b>Pros:</b> There is a certain elegance in this model.  Maybe because it takes the middle ground between a complete denial of the possibility of travel (model 1) and their description involving not the most trivial concepts (model 3).  In addition, there are indirect <a href="http://www.membrana.ru/particle/2010">experimental confirmations of</a> this model at the level of quantum informatics. <br>  <b>Cons: the</b> idea of ‚Äã‚Äãpredetermination of the past and the future seems at least strange.  Even if it is a weak predetermination, it is not quite clear how the laws of physics limit the freedom of choice of a person to commit, and especially not to commit certain actions.  It is clear that this restriction occurs through circumstances.  Does every traveler in the past always have such circumstances that will not allow him to give up the flight?  Something similar can still be represented at the level of quantum particles, but the work of this mechanism in the macrocosm is not yet sufficiently described. <br>  Departing from fatalism to weak predetermination, we are faced with the question of the criterion.  To what extent does history allow itself to change?  What is considered a key point?  To this question we will return. <br><br><h5>  Model 3: alternate realities </h5><br><blockquote> "-Apparently, the time continuum was broken, and a new event sequence emerged that changed reality <br>  -Dok, you can be easier? <br>  - Now, let me illustrate.  Imagine that this line represents time, this is the present, 1985, the future and the past.  Up to this point in time, somewhere in the past, the line deviated at such an angle and another 1985 appeared, another for you, for me and for Einstein, but real for everyone else. "," Back to the Future-2 " </blockquote><br>  <b>Essence: a</b> change in history creates a new stream of time, where an alternative scenario of events develops.  The traveler himself remains in the reality he created. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/98f/f4d/ef2/98ff4def2a5b961ad9a56e725c12b490.jpg"><br>  <i>Fig.1 - a classic idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe branching of reality</i> <br>  It is usually implied that reality branches off only if there is a serious (aha, here it is again - a criterion?) Influence on history.  For example, you go into the past, and at the starting point remains the observer (H).  After your quiet walk through the past as a tourist, he will see your return. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/d92/d9e/bde/d92d9ebde798ae5574a06faffc4631f1.jpg"><br>  <i>Fig.</i>  <i>2 - time loop closed</i> <br>  But if you go to make (or prevent) a revolution, then for the observer you will not return from the past, because  become part of the new reality. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/81c/850/b1b/81c850b1b1a13fb111f1a8dd774397f0.jpg"><br>  <i>Fig.</i>  <i>3 - time loop broken</i> <br><br>  <b>For non-programmers:</b> the article often uses the terms "branch" (aka "branch"), "trunk", "merge" - let them not frighten you.  These concepts are used in the SVN version control system, which is not necessary to understand that: <br>  trunk - the initial, ‚Äúour‚Äù flow of time, the course of history. <br>  branch, branch - an alternative flow of time, formed by interfering with history. <br>  merge is the process of branch injection into a trunk, i.e.  the consequences of alternative history events become part of the main flow of history (the notion of the main / additional flow is conditional, here it‚Äôs rather a matter of one stream as the parent stream, and the second as a branch from it). <br><br>  Thus, you can at least rewrite history from scratch - only this will be its new branch, and the old one will remain intact.  A sort of GitHub with forks from any past revision. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/479/baf/d7e/479bafd7eaa90c9bc66a79fb812b3d01.jpg"><br>  In this model, time ceases to be a one-dimensional line, since  an axis of variation of events is added.  The Multiversum thus obtained (the Universe with many alternative realities) is visually depicted as a tree. <br>  The tree can be represented in expanded form, where nodes are events, and outgoing branches are possible outcomes (Fig. 4A).  When it comes to changing history, it is more convenient to take one of the tree‚Äôs routes as a reference (zero reality, trunk), portray it as a straight line, and alternative route as a branch (Fig. 4B). <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/863/f43/04b/863f4304bc78ca2f7658622a927c4079.jpg"><br>  <i>Fig.4 - tree of alternative realities in two views</i> <br>  It is logical: <b>after intervening in the past, the course of events develops along a new path, thereby tracing a different trajectory in the space of options</b> .  The only question is what is this space: the theoretical model, or the real parallel realities.  The fact is that we are faced with the concept of an alternative course of events not only when traveling into the past.  Remember the theory of the ‚Äúfissile universe‚Äù Everett.  In its popular exposition it is said that at each event the Universe splits into several realities, where the possible outcomes of the event are realized.  Roughly speaking, when a coin is thrown, reality is cloned into three copies: in one, an eagle falls, in another tails, in the third, it rises on an edge.  We threw a coin and an eagle fell - what are the other two realities?  Potential states of the quantum world, or physically existing parallel worlds?  This is the fundamental question of modern physics, the answer to which we do not yet have. <br>  <b>Examples: the</b> film ‚ÄúBack to the Future‚Äù <br>  <b>Pros:</b> this theory really resolves paradoxes.  And she does this without causing many questions of restriction of freedom of action in the past.  The notion of alternative time flows echoes a number of theories (the dividing Evevere Universe, the many-leaved Mega-Universe of Sakharov, the three-dimensional time of Bartini, etc.), and generally seems to be a logical extension of the one-dimensional time model. <br>  <b>Cons:</b> brilliantly resolving some issues, the model introduced others.  If a branch of history is formed only with serious interference in history, then what is the criterion for this ‚Äúseriousness‚Äù?  If a branch is always formed, how exactly does it flow back into the main stream, thereby ensuring the return of the traveler from the past?  The hypothesis of the merging of realities is not new, but so far remains insufficiently disclosed. <br><br><h5>  Model summary </h5><br>  There is another model.  It is rarely found in literature, it is fundamentally different from the rest, and now you will understand why.  So, the same basic data: the traveler erases himself from history, i.e.  In the new scenario of events, he does not appear on the light.  In this model, there are no parallel realities, the main one has changed, it is the only flow of time.  Returning in due time, the traveler will be unrecognizable by anyone.  The fact that now no one flies into the past does not mean that the traveler will still be born, because the change in history has already happened, and it simply remains. <br>  Imagine that a villain went on a time machine to the distant past in order to radically change the history of mankind.  We just disappear from reality, the word we never had.  It is logical that already accomplished events cannot be ‚Äúcanceled‚Äù and just disappear like that.  More precisely, this is dictated to us by intuition, but we need to think about the rationale.  <b>I propose for the time being that it is simply considered an axiom: history cannot be rewritten.</b>  <b>All previous models are various options for implementing this protection</b> : <br><ol><li>  Does not let fly into the past </li><li>  Does not give in the past something to change </li><li>  Does not allow to change the main flow of time, leading changes to an additional </li></ol><br><br>  The search for the model of resolution of paradoxes by mankind itself implies the following of this axiom.  Therefore, we have 3 time models at our disposal.  We will assume that this is how we outlined the contours of the first question: the protection of history against changes.  What can now be done with these models?  I propose to immediately exclude the first: if time travel is impossible, then all our previous and subsequent arguments are meaningless.  Two models remain - which one is correct?  Or maybe both are true, being special cases of a more general model?  Before we talk about this, we need to look at the issue of changing the story from a different angle. <br><br><h4>  Is Ray Bradbury right </h4><br>  Let us forget for a second about the models considered, about the predetermination of history or parallel realities.  We have a flow of history before us, a change is made in it - we are only interested in one thing: will the consequences of this influence attenuate, or will the degree of deviation from the primary scenario increase like a snowball? <br>  In Ray Bradbury's story ‚ÄúAnd the sound of thunder‚Äù a butterfly crushed in the Jurassic period leads to large-scale changes in our time.  The author develops a version about the high coherence of events, which makes history extremely unstable: even the slightest change in the past, especially the distant one, causes a serious deviation. <br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Fragment</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  We do not want to change the future.  Here, in the Past, we are uninvited guests.  The government does not approve of our excursions.  We have to pay considerable bribes so that we are not deprived of concessions. A time machine is a delicate matter.  Without knowing it, we can kill an important animal, a pichugu, a beetle, crush a flower and destroy an important link in the development of the species. <br>  ‚ÄúI don't understand something,‚Äù said Ekels. <br>  ‚ÄúSo listen,‚Äù Travis continued.  ‚ÄúSuppose we accidentally killed a mouse here.‚Äù  This means that all future descendants of this mouse will not be - right? <br>  - Yes. <br>  - There will be no descendants from descendants from all its descendants!  So, carelessly stepping foot, you destroy not one, and not a dozen, and not a thousand, but a million - a billion mice! <br>  ‚ÄúWell, they died,‚Äù Ekels agreed.  - So what? <br>  - What?  - Travis sniffed contemptuously.  ‚ÄúWhat about foxes, who needed these mice to feed?‚Äù  Not enough ten mice - one fox will die.  Ten less foxes - the lion will die of hunger.  One less lion - all sorts of insects and vultures will die, innumerable forms of life will disappear.  And here is the result: in fifty nine million years, a caveman, one of the dozen who inhabit the whole world, driven by hunger, goes hunting for a boar or a saber-toothed tiger.  But you, my friend, having crushed one mouse, thereby crushed all the tigers in these places.  And the caveman is starving to death.  And this person, notice yourself, is not just one person, no!  This is a whole future people.  Ten sons would have come out of his loins.  One hundred would have come from them - and so on, and a whole civilization would have arisen.  Destroy one person - and you destroy an entire tribe, people, historical era.  It's like killing one of Adam's grandchildren.  Crush the mouse with your foot - this will be tantamount to an earthquake that will distort the face of the whole earth, will radically change our destinies.  The death of one cave man - the death of a billion of his descendants, strangled in the womb.  Maybe Rome will not appear on its seven hills.  Europe will forever remain a dense forest, only in Asia will the magnificent life flourish.  Step on the mouse and you will crush the pyramids.  Step on the mouse and you will leave a dent the size of the Grand Canyon for Eternity.  There will be no Queen Elizabeth, Washington will not cross the Delaware.  The United States will not appear at all.  So be careful.  Hold on to the trail.  Never get off of it! <br></div></div><br><br>  Now consider a small example.  You are going to work in the morning, leave the house, and take the subway to it.  Somehow a correction is made in history: you have learned that the subway is not working today.  Taking a bike, you reach it.  We make one more correction: a tire is punctured.  But you will walk! <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/5f8/8b9/02b/5f88b902b2847238e8feda11f8d5d1cb.jpg"><br>  <i>Fig.</i>  <i>5 - the desire of realities to unite</i> <br><br>  Chronocard shows: <br>  1. Branch injection into a trunk occurs at different points in time, since  Achieving a target state (getting to work) occurs in different ways. <br>  2. The deformation does not completely fade, i.e.  Despite the fact that in all three cases you are at work, there are some minor variations (parked bike, dirty shoes, etc.). <br><br>  What happens if you abstract from the actors?  If the system has a goal, it will strive for it under any scenarios, thus possessing a certain <b>stability margin</b> (to deflecting effects).  Now I would not like to go into the jungle of philosophy and speak on the topic of purpose for material objects, people, society, etc. The fact that events in the world around us obey the laws of physics and in a certain sense are ordered - I think it is obvious.  <b>History can not be considered a set of coincidences, it has its own conditionality</b> .  After the primitive communal system, capitalism could not have come, bypassing the slave and feudal system.  If the start of the war in 1939 was prevented, it would probably have started anyway later, because the world would have preserved the prerequisites for that.  If a certain scientific discovery was not made by one scientist, someone else would have made it later, and so on.  <b>History events have a direction, a tendency, which means that any deviation of the course of history tends to fade.</b> <br>  This hypothesis takes us to the next level of understanding of the mechanics of time, because it actually combines the two models considered earlier.  In one we talked about the resistance of history to change, in the other about parallel streams of time.  Assuming that parallel flows of time tend to flow back into the main flow, we separate a single essence from these two models: the <b>elasticity of the flow of time</b> . <br><br><h4>  How is the merging of realities? </h4><br>  In the last article this caused a lot of questions.  The question is extremely difficult, therefore, on the assumption, I clarify: it is not the objects that merge, but the events.  Consider the well-known light cone, but instead of the spatial axis, we will have an axis of options. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/68f/dc0/7a8/68fdc07a85e77cec2d63143cdefcc880.jpg"><br>  <i>Fig.</i>  <i>6 - the present, as a projection of alternatives of the past and the root of the options for the future</i> <br>  The upper cone is the future, these are possible outcomes from the current state, the lower cone is the past, it is a certain spectrum of possible previous states.  The walls of the cones define the boundaries of reachability, i.e.  to go beyond the limits of the cone means to go into a state (delta along the b axis) that cannot be reached from the current state in a given period of time (delta along the t axis). <br>  The merging of events of the cone of the past at the point of the present means a common result for them.  But how does this happen at the level of changing the structure of objects, how do they overlap?  Perhaps something similar is happening as shown in ‚ÄúBack to the Future‚Äù, where the headline of the newspaper is smoothly changing right before our eyes ‚Äî this is ‚Äúbrunch to trunk‚Äù. <br><br><h4>  Quantum coin </h4><br>  Two people are sitting in the room: Alice and Bob.  Five minutes ago, Alice threw a coin and fell tails, they both saw it.  We have a time machine, and we make history correction: an eagle drops out five minutes ago.  As a result, we have two realities: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/27a/509/743/27a50974326f07c438b885f8480a955b.jpg"><br>  <i>Fig.</i>  <i>7 - experiment with two observers</i> <br>  Alice and the coin cannot be separated, since the result of a coin toss <b>does not exist in isolation from his observation</b> .  But we still have Bob, who with some delay also finds out the result of the coin toss, and he and Alice exchange a pair of replicas.  Two outcomes, and two realities - we see this in the diagram. <br>  Let's change the conditions of the experiment: Bob does not see the result.  From the point of view of Bob, these two realities are identical, in both of them he sees a coin toss, but does not know the outcome.  Important detail (thanks to <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/agent_j/" class="user_link">Agent_J</a> for the amendment): Alice does not tell the result to Bob, then for him the course of events is really the same in both cases.  Bob can leave in two brunches too, as soon as Alice tells him the result of the experiment.  Let's try this in 5D: <img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/99f/c6d/a46/99fc6da463b3dde7783d4431eaf738c3.png" alt="image"><br>  <i>Fig.8 - experiment with one observer</i> <br>  Think about it, it is really curious!  As if two Alice communicate with one Bob, but simply pronouncing a single phrase initiates the division of the listener's time flow. <br><br>  Here we come to understanding the role of the observer in the model of parallel realities.  <b>The line on the chronocard is not a reality, it is the state of a group of objects</b> , the observation of any of which includes the observer in this line.  Nature does not make a complete copy of the universe, it simply keeps a dif of their differences. <br><br><h4>  So after all, how is the merger? </h4><br>  First: the merger should not be interpreted literally, as if the worlds are becoming identical.  The two worlds are somewhat different, somewhat similar - and this similarity is something like a junction in the space of options.  As in the example where, in three ways, a person still got to work ‚Äî at this moment the three realities had this junction, they <b>partially</b> merged.  Of course, it is incorrect to speak of a complete fusion of realities, because reality itself, as has already been shown in the paradox of the quantum coin, is just a slice of the state space.  How different objects can be in different joints, pockets and streams of options space is a good exercise for the imagination! <br><br>  Frequently asked question: why do brunches merge, where does the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãelasticity of history come from?  I will answer in other words and briefly: system stability.  This is a universal property of almost any more or less complex system, be it a person, a country's economy, world politics, etc. The system has a goal (in one form or another), and the system works like an automatic regulator that corrects movement towards the goal.  Therefore, disturbances introduced into the past will encounter resistance to the stability of the systems of the world.  The points of bifurcation is quite another matter, the impact on them can drastically change the course of events.  But the damping of the dif will still be, just on a larger scale. <br><br>  In the course of the discussions, <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/mrseventh/" class="user_link">MrSeventh</a> proposed an <b>interesting hypothesis</b> : what if the physical carrier of the brunch of differences of brunch is dark matter and / or energy? <br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">I can assume the following</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  Dark energy is responsible for the accelerated expansion of the universe.  For a number of reasons, the theory of the pulsating Universe is close to me, i.e.  after the big bang and expansion, compression follows (cyclical pulsation, like heartbeat).  This means that the parameters of dark energy will have to change. <br>  As an option, the thing is this: the Universe is now young, and most brunch goes into discrepancy, it will take them trillions of years to begin to converge (according to the attenuation curve).  The synthesis of different variants of the Universe will begin in one, the combination of different brunches, the dif‚Äôs log will decrease, the dark energy parameters (if it is the physical carrier of these logs) change, the Universe shrinks to a state of singularity, where not only all matter, space, and time, but all options (time streams). <br></div></div><br><br><h4>  Single model </h4><br>  And now we connect all the above.  Two models of time (predetermination of history and branches) actually merged into one: "branches with merg".  Any changes in the history (even the fact of being in the past) draw alternative routes in the space of options, but the flow of time has the property of elasticity, which manifests itself as a gradual desire of alternative routes to join the main one.<font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> At the same time, the observed world is a cross-section of a complex quantum interweaving of time flows, when objects in the same space can belong to different time flows (as long as there is no observation between them). </font></font><br><br><h4><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> Mathematical model </font></font></h4><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">So, we need to simulate the attenuation of the deviation of history that occurs when interfering with the past. </font></font><br><br> <i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The first option: the</font></font></i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> most trivial, we believe that the brunch attenuation occurs with some constant acceleration. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It is described by a uniformly accelerated motion formula. </font></font><br> <i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The second option:</font></font></i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> more likely, where the flow of time is compared with the spring, and then the force (and hence the acceleration) is proportional to the current deviation. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">That is, the further the flow of history went to the side, the more he seeks to go back. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Described by the damped sinusoid formula. </font></font><br> <i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The third option:</font></font></i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> here is an interesting story. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The first version of the article contained</font></font><div class="spoiler"> <b class="spoiler_title"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">derivation of the formula for the 2nd option</font></font></b> <div class="spoiler_text"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/eb5/03c/b62/eb503cb621234588d80cc3439b57f303.jpg"></div></div><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Thanks to </font></font><a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/strepetarh/" class="user_link"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Strepetarh</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> , </font><a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/strepetarh/" class="user_link"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Sayonji</font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> , </font></font><a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/sayonji/" class="user_link"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">mayorovp</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> , an </font></font><a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/mayorovp/" class="user_link"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">error</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> was noticed: the calculation is based on a uniformly accelerated motion formula, which is not suitable here. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">But this formula, as it turned out, is well suited for describing the observed picture (see below).</font></font><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/5b2/cef/39a/5b2cef39a7fbc3e4724a04b7f816ef6e.jpg"><br><ol><li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> Equal acceleration attenuation. </font></font></li><li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> Attenuation according to the correct "spring" formula. </font></font></li><li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> The third is the old formula. </font></font></li></ol><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> And now it's time to move from theory to practice. </font></font><br><br><h4>  Experiment </h4><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">What if history data can be modeled?

After going through several options, I settled on Conway‚Äôs ‚ÄúLife‚Äù algorithm. I had heard almost nothing about him before, so I sat down to search - and I was surprised to find many articles on Habr√© on this topic. It remains to understand how to assess the difference between the worlds. I wanted to build a solution on a certain evolutionary principle, since the history of the real world is still progress and improvement, and not an established ‚Äúcell boiling‚Äù mode. Maybe something like </font></font><a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/154015/"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">a genetic selection mechanism.</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">, or something like that, which would introduce into the world some measurable characteristics that allow you to compare different versions of the story (for example, "the number of cells of the 42nd level"). On top of the algorithm Conway turned out to be quite difficult to screw something. He chose the optimal parameters of "Life", and my attempts to add my own rules to the algorithm made the world unstable. After some time, I chose the simplest solution: to use the classic version of the algorithm without any frills, and simply subtract pixel-wise one world from another (Hamming distance) - this will be the degree of divergence of the story. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I have embodied what was said in the project: </font></font><a href="https://github.com/TimeCoder/LifeTime"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">https://github.com/TimeCoder/LifeTime</font></font></a> <br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> There you can also download the collection for Windows: </font></font><a href=""><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">https://github.com/TimeCoder/LifeTime/raw/master/bin/lifetime.0.0.0.12.bin .win32.zip</font></font></a> <br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And also under Linux (thanks to </font></font><a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/vershov/" class="user_link"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">vershov</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> ): </font></font><br> <a href=""><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">lifetime.1.0.0.12.bin.linux.x86.tar.gz </font></font></a> <br> <a href=""><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">lifetime.1.0.0.12.bin.linux.x64.tar.gz</font></font></a> <br><br>  Video: <br><iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/iAhfBY2pLsI%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700022,15700186,15700191,15700253,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhjk7yqa3R3fdLxzcqLrn6aplppzjw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> Before launching our time machine, let's get acquainted with the UI and program code. </font></font><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/691/ef6/064/691ef60646bbbcba17ecbde77aff45ad.jpg"><br>  <i>Fig.</i> <i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">10 - controls</font></font></i> <br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> The program interface consists of 4 areas:</font></font><br><ol><li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">World - here the process of life development is displayed, after an accidental filling, the cells are formed and broken up according to the Conway algorithm ‚ÄúLife‚Äù. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The edges of the world are "stitched" among themselves.</font></font></li><li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Chronocard - in fact, here we see the chrono-wood, Multiversum, the space of options - call it what you want. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Initially, we have one straight line - the primary flow of time, zero reality (green). </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">When we move into the past, a tunnel (blue) forms over the main stream, and a new scenario will be represented by a curve (yellow).</font></font></li><li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> The control unit where the time machine is turned on and the movement starts. </font></font></li><li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> The output area of ‚Äã‚Äãvarious data about the world, the traveler and the movement. </font></font></li></ol><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> Now consider the procedure for working with a time machine: </font></font><br><ol><li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Immediately after launching the program, you will see the boiling ocean of life and a running time counter. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Wait a bit and press the "Begin" button.</font></font></li><li>   ,    .      ?

But now we need to draw the third curve. Suppose this reality spun off from a trunk, and differs from it as much (quantitatively) as the second - it turns out that the trajectories of the second and third streams coincide - but qualitatively different events take place in them! Another option: the third reality spun off from the second, and in it the course of history quickly comes to the trunk variant (for example, first the past was changed, reality 2 arose,then they flew into the past in order to return everything as it was - a reality formed 3, almost identical to the 1st). The deviation of the third reality from the second is the same as the second from the first. The task is to come up with an optimal method of drawing chrono-cards, taking into account such nuances.</font></font><br><br><h5>  Code </h5><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">A brief look at the architecture of the project, and the key points of individual fragments.

Not always dif fades out, sometimes the deviation constantly grows, including after the top of the loop. In order to accurately identify what it depends on, we need to refine the program and careful experiments. So far, I have not noticed that the size of the world, the object, the range of transfer, influenced the nature of the curve.

<h6>  Three types of loop time </h6><br>  In the course of the article, we have several times been faced with the question: what is considered a ‚Äúserious‚Äù intervention in history and what is not?  Perhaps, already in the foreseeable future, we will learn to calculate the trajectories of reality as Calculators in A. Azimov's ‚ÄúThe End of Eternity‚Äù, but for now you need to start at least with something. <br>  Let's start with the concept of a reference system.  They are two, although they are inextricably interconnected: the world and the traveler.  You can go back in time and make tremendous changes in the neighboring galaxy, but this will not affect the past of the traveler here on Earth.  Another example: a traveler can go back a day and add some trifle to the stream of events of his twin, as a result of which he does not fly in a day <br>  t in the past.  The deviation of history in the first example is enormous in the world‚Äôs reference system, but imperceptibly from the traveler‚Äôs point of view.  In the second example, the opposite is true: for the world, this is a vanishingly small fluctuation, and from the point of view of the traveler a completely different scenario of events has started. <br><br>  Measuring the deviations of history in the world‚Äôs reporting system is an extremely interesting and important topic, only so far there are more questions in it.  History flows affect too many people until the necessary models are developed to quantify the significance of world events.  Say, what a change in history is more significant: saving President Kennedy or preventing the Chernobyl accident? <br><br>  The simplest thing we can do now is assess the degree of history change by the effect of these changes on the top of the time loop.  And then it is logical to distinguish 3 degrees of history change: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/484/6c8/2da/4846c82daf74c899a907cef82c1e76b4.jpg"><br>  <i>Fig.</i>  <i>16 - three types of time loop</i> <br><ol><li>  The change almost completely fades to the top of the loop.

For example, they flew in yesterday and in their notebook they drew a picture.  Returning, open the notebook, and see it (the main thing before the start of the experiment is not to look at the notebook). </li><li>  The rejection of the story is so powerful that it can cancel the flight itself. </li></ol><br><br>  It is important to understand the relativity of these degrees, i.e.  any change in the history fades, the only question is how much it will have time to fade by the time of departure to the past.  However, the attenuation continues after this point. <br><br>  In the program, for some reason, I did not succeed in catching a type II loop on the move: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/293/0c8/915/2930c891501646b02c75c5c0e86651fc.jpg"><br>  <i>Fig.</i>  <i>17 - examples from the program</i> <br><br>  The loop type on the monitor is displayed in the <i>Leap Type</i> parameter.  Almost always there is number 3. What happens?  <b>When the simulation reaches the point from which the descent into the past was accomplished, the object (which flew away) to the current world (brunch) is superimposed.</b>  If the cell arrangement is the same, i.e.  in the new version of history, this object has this object - the ‚Äúinvariance coefficient‚Äù is 1. If no cells match, then it is 0. So far, the code sets the conditional thresholds of this coefficient, which delimit 3 types of loop (absolutely "from the ceiling"). <br><br>  Does this mean that any movement into the past leads to paradoxes?  I think not, just the ‚ÄúLife‚Äù algorithm is extremely sensitive to the changes being made.  He gives a model of the world in a very rough approximation, without goal-oriented processes, while human activity somehow has its own vector.  Due to this, as I assume, the <b>effect of damping dif in simulation is less than in the real world</b> . <br><br>  Readers have a lot of questions like "whether history fades away, didn‚Äôt modeling in the program disprove this?".  I think that is not refuted, but partially confirmed.  There are no more cases when the deviation monotonously grows than when the deviation fades out, at least by 5-10%.  Even the fact that these cases are registered indicates that history can ‚Äústraighten out‚Äù in principle, has elastic properties.  Some have noticed specific conditions under which a branch is particularly quickly merged into a trunk - and these conditions can be interpreted in two ways.  Yes, the history of the world in the program, like that of the real world, is heterogeneous, consists of several ‚Äúepochs‚Äù: <br><ul><li>  high density of life and its homogeneity </li><li>  life thins and more complex structures form, isolated groups of cells </li><li>  balance era </li></ul><br>  But doesn't it look like the evolution of our cosmos and the planet?  And yes, moving within the same epoch, moving between epochs give a different result.  This can be interpreted as a feature of the algorithm that prevents us from conducting correct experiments.  And it can be considered a reflection of the real processes of the universe. <br><br><h4>  Conclusion </h4><br>  Can we say that in general, history most often seeks to return to its own course?  At a minimum, such an effect is registered, and to talk about its frequency, more experiments are needed.  Of course, experiments should be carried out in an automated mode, i.e.  instead of UI, implement API programs + scripts, where to set different test scenarios with multiple repetitions.  What will it give? <br><br>  At a minimum, we can <b>evaluate the dynamic characteristics of the flow of time.</b>  As the decay curve of the deformation of the history depends on the size of the object, the size of the world, what is the most general form of this curve? <br><br>  Having made a reusable time machine, we will be able to <b>simulate complex paradoxes</b> , and see what really happens.  Undo cancel history change?  Groundhog Day?  Paradox statues?  All this can be seen ‚Äúlive‚Äù in the form of real (more precisely, virtual) 5D tracks. <br>  Maybe you have ideas and suggestions, in what other direction can the project be developed? <br><br>  In addition to conceptual tasks, there are a number of purely technical improvements, in particular: <br><ul><li>  There is an acute need for optimization, it is necessary to finish the algorithm (for example, to implement HashLife) - I hope that someday they will reach their hands. </li><li>  Can someone build binaries for Linux? </li><li>  Automated experiment system. </li><li>  Transition to Qt5, C ++ 11 </li><li>  And many small improvements on the interface, the ability to save the world, select an object from the past, teleport it when flying into the past, etc. </li></ul><br>  The main thing is to understand the fundamental principle of the question!  Now there are quite a few ‚Äúmyths‚Äù, alas, that shape many people‚Äôs ideas about time.  One time I read about "if you move a second ago, you will find yourself in space, because the Earth is moving."  Or the state of ‚Äúchronostasis‚Äù, when the world around ‚Äúfreezes‚Äù, is called ‚Äútime dilation‚Äù, whereas, on the contrary, the acceleration of the observer‚Äôs time.  But such questions are easily solvable even without any experiments, at the level of elementary logic!  What I mean is that a huge amount of time research work can (and should) be carried out even without working chronotechnologies, armed with common sense.  Plus, it is not the first time that programming comes to the rescue. <br><br>  Today we touched the tip of the iceberg, briefly examining one of the paradoxes of time.  The theme of time is infinite, in a variety of questions and its fascination.  If anyone is interested in participating in this work - please open several projects.  Without a drop of irony, I will say that in the matter of studying time, not the last human hope for habra people, whose ability to think logically and burn creatively will help make new discoveries! <br><br>  Yes, the article does not disclose the topic of event laws (eventology), does not list various ways of observing the past (because the article is about travels), and of course many people have questions: are travels to the past possible at all, is there time?  In order not to go into just one philosophy (and as a result - holivar), it is necessary to make assumptions.  First of all, we allow the possibility of flying into the past.  Then we have the opportunity not only to discuss this topic and express the most "crazy" ideas, but also to bring the stream of thoughts into the system, and even try to confirm our theories experimentally.  So, step by step, we are approaching the solution of the greatest mystery - time! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/178959/">https://habr.com/ru/post/178959/</a></p>
