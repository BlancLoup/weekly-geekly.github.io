Several articles have been written about the Blackberry Playbook, the forums are already filled with numerous questions and usage stories.  It does not make sense to produce reviews, but to write your thoughts about how a Playbook interacts with Blackberry phones can be useful. <br><br>  I do not know how the other users of RIM products, and I expected very tight integration with the rest of the products from this tablet.  Judge for yourself, there are plenty of 7 inch tablets on the market, there are plenty of applications for iOS and Android, brand tablets have a good design.  What remains is the Blackberry corporate chip and integration with its phones.

    <a name="habracut"></a>  As soon as I downloaded and installed the firmware on the tablet, I began to study how the phone synchronizes with the tablet.  It turned out that the procedure is simplified to the banality.  All you need - to put on the phone Blackberry bridge.  Through this program we scan the QR code displayed on the tablet and that's it.  The phone is tied via Bluetooth to our tablet. <br><br> <a title="Habraffe.ru" href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/4c/62/4c6294479455463693d59e5b105223ef.JPG"></a> <br><br>  Let's start with the first thing that catches your eye.  We see that all configured mailboxes from the phone are already on the subject.  Moreover, there is even a history of messages.  Also transferred contacts, calendar, settings, BBM (BlackBerry Messenger) and saved Wi-Fi sessions.  Let's see in more detail. <br><br><h5>  post office </h5><br>  Appearance is pretty standard.  Two panels: a list of letters and the body of the letter.  For two weeks of use, I did not notice any special differences with the telephone version.  Although the telephone version has chips that I do not use, which others may need (such as filters).  For all the time that I have a tablet, I used an email client only a couple of times to check how it works at all.  It so happened that it was more convenient for me to check mail either on the phone or on the computer (when I was sitting behind it). <br><br> <a title="Habraffe.ru" href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/3a/da/3ada393e79221810706eff205cb9ed2a.jpg"></a> <br><br><h5>  Contacts </h5><br>  In fact, we only need contacts if you carefully fill in such fields as E-mail.  It may also be good to have a list of all contacts with you on the tablet.  I couldn‚Äôt think of a situation when I can‚Äôt find them in the phone and search in the tablet. <br><br><h5>  The calendar </h5><br>  Calendar thing is useful and necessary.  I am extremely tied to the calendar, it shows all my meetings and busy days.  As a result, when a client calls me, I asked him to wait a couple of seconds and climbed into the calendar on the same phone.  When you have a tablet at hand, it's easier to tap a couple of times on the screen and get the same calendar on the big screen.  I liked the visual display of information on the calendar tablet less than on the phone.  If the tablet renders more than 5 meters away, and I also am in a lying position, everything is done in the old fashioned way. <br><br> <a title="Habraffe.ru" href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/ef/14/ef14edd99d71fe1a40e4f90aced89133.JPG"></a> <br><br><h5>  Blackberry messenger </h5><br>  First, some definitions.  Messenger allows BlackBerry owners to communicate with each other (with a connected BIS plan).  Organized it is quite convenient, especially if you have a lot of people familiar with such phones.  BBM also supports groups that are essentially chat rooms.  BBM allows you to transfer sound, images and supports comments to them.  In general - a very handy thing. <br>  BBM on the PlayBook is convenient as well as on the phone.  Only the on-screen keyboard can cause discomfort.  The first few minutes of communication with our friend showed that the on-screen keyboard is not so bad.  That's just further disappointment awaited me.  There are no groups in BBM on the tablet.  At all.  Actually, apart from the ability to send messages to the user, we have nothing left of BBM.  We received an instant messenger for a narrow circle of users. <br><br><h5>  Wi-Fi and Internet </h5><br>  Well, everything is simple.  We got the saved sessions from the phone.  It turned out to be very convenient and rather unexpected. <br><br>  In the BlackBerry Bridge tab on the tablet there is a separate browser icon.  With it, we get the same standard browser, only using the Internet phone.  It can be either Wi-Fi, GPRS, EDGE or BIS-B. <br><br><h5>  Total </h5><br>  So, what we got in the end?  On the one hand, the integration with the phone turned out to be quite dense.  They are pleased with small buns, such as when a call comes to your phone, you see a call notification on your tablet and you can turn off the call sound.  When you receive a message, the upper left corner of the screen flashes red.  Such attention to detail pleases.  But on the other hand, we got all the same features as on the phone, and in some cases even less.  Most of the functionality is implemented worse in terms of convenience.  It is hoped that all these shortcomings will be corrected in the future. <br>  The rest of the device I liked.  Even more. <br><br>  Ps.  It‚Äôs very interesting to hear about sharing RIM products from other users. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/120386/">https://habr.com/ru/post/120386/</a></p>
