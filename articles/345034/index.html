The results of new research and user testing enable designers to embed innovative ideas into their projects, providing their robots with leading positions in web space. <br><br>  In this article, I want to talk about a relatively new way of design, which will increase the productivity of your projects. <br><br><img src="http://i.piccy.info/i9/f33ffadb363f4cb076f6e22edbc48b90/1490909754/54474/1132129/Bez_ymeny_1.jpg" alt="image">

    <h2>  Method to speed up the decision </h2><br>  If you want to push the user to certain actions, for example, click the buy button on the site, then this technique is perfect for you. <br><br>  Let's consider the situation: <br><br>  For example, on a site selling mobile phones, Artyom is trying to make a choice between models that he liked.  What factors can speed up this process? <br><br>  To begin, let's understand why some people make decisions quickly, while others in the process of long deliberation. <br><br>  We can say that it depends on the nature of each person.  Some of us are prone to spontaneous decisions, while others prefer to think about each situation. <br>  It can also be assumed that taking important decisions takes more time than choosing between less significant things. <br><br>  But, in fact, neither the character of the individual person, nor the consequences of the choice influence the speed of the decision. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>  Ruzbe Kiani (Kiani 2014) conducted a study that ascertained how various factors influence the choice.  The study revealed that in the process of thinking about options, our brain takes into account the results of making such decisions, in the past adding to this information all the evidence collected in favor of a specific decision. <br><br>  But most importantly, Kiani revealed the relationship of time spent on a sense of confidence.  The longer the problem is solved, the more difficult it looks for our brain, thus the person is less confident in the correctness of the choice.  This means that thinking time increases. And so in a circle.  Subsequently, the decision is most likely not taken. <br><br>  To make it clearer, let's use the wording of the psychologist Susan Wainshank, written in her book based on these studies: <br><br>  "The main factor determining the speed of decision making is confidence in the optimality of the chosen option" <br><br><h3>  How to gain confidence </h3><br>  ‚ÄúThe decision-making neural network in determining the degree of confidence is guided by two factors - the time spent and the amount of evidence.  This process can be accelerated by giving the impression that there is a lot of accumulated evidence. ‚Äù <br><br>  Let's go back to the situation with Artem, who is looking at information about phones on the site. <br><br>  If he is provided with a lot of information about the advantages of the models, then one might think that the brain will accumulate positive information and the choice will be made.  But, as we already know, it is necessary to take into account that it will take a lot of time to study a large amount of information and Artyom will lose confidence. <br><br>  Therefore, it is better to divide all information into small fragments and place them, for example, in separate blocks.  The point is that the decision-making neural network regards each fragment as one single piece of evidence. <br><br>  As a result, we will get that instead of viewing all the information together and evaluating it as one advantage, Artyom will look at a lot of separate blocks in a short time (where, for example, the battery capacity will be ironed as one independent fragment, and the processor power will be different and so on. e.) In turn, the brain will regard this in such a way that, in a fast time, a lot of evidence was gathered in favor of choosing a particular model. <br><br>  The option in which the user in a short time will collect a large amount of evidence and will gain a sense of confidence in the correctness of his choice, in consequence of which he will make a purchase. <br><br><img src="http://i.piccy.info/i9/6c86a50301f52a7ad74b1b5862364bdf/1490906506/110840/1132129/Kartynka_3.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The option in which the user receives a lot of evidence in favor of the purchase, but does not get a sense of confidence in the optimality of the choice due to the fact that he spends a lot of time in the process of studying the information. <br><br><img src="http://i.piccy.info/i9/fd21e27e8a89792c7448c0e919871d91/1490906947/134193/1132129/Kartynka_2.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The option in which the user does not gather enough evidence, thus will not get a sense of confidence to make a purchase. <br><br><img src="http://i.piccy.info/i9/20b66db28fae98e68ec2780b990fa3b5/1490907017/185024/1132129/kartynka_1.jpg" alt="image"></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/345034/">https://habr.com/ru/post/345034/</a></p>
