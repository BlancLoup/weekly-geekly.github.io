For more than ten years, players have been waiting for the continuation of the <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half-Life_(%25D1%2581%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580%25D0%25B8%25D1%258F_%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B3%25D1%2580)">cult series</a> from Valve, which gave rise to many ironic jokes about the CEO, Geib Newell: Gabe can‚Äôt count to three, but immediately counts to four, Valve does not ride E3, because Gabe went immediately to the fourth grade after the second and so on.  Gamers have already gone through all the stages, from anger to humility, and hope to see the continuation of the adventures of the great theoretical physicist <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2593%25D0%25BE%25D1%2580%25D0%25B4%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BD_%25D0%25A4%25D1%2580%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD">Gordon Freeman</a> melts with each passing year.  The CEO and founder of the developer of the Half-Life series Valve has been avoiding questions about the game for years.  During interviews and meetings with Newell, players and journalists were often warned: ‚ÄúNo questions about Half-Life 3!‚Äù.  But still, it happened. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <i>‚ÄúWhen we think about the tasks and challenges that await us in the future, we tend to choose those projects and franchises that are best suited for their implementation.</i>  <i>And if we do not have a suitable project, then we will create another one.</i>  <i>You know, I am a fan of TV shows, a fan of a number of writers, a lover of cinema and, of course, computer games.</i>  <i>And every time I get an amazing experience, and sometimes I start to worry about the thought that I will never feel something like that again.</i>  <i>I am a fan of Terry Pratchett, but after his death I will not be able to read a single of his new novels about the Flat World.</i>  <i>We understand all this and believe that thanks to this understanding we can make our users happier, and entertainment for them is better.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>We are going to build on our own experience, and over the years we have learned enough.</i>  <i>We are not going to bump into retro because there are so many things in the world that deserve to be studied by us.</i>  <i>The only reason for creating a ‚Äúclassic‚Äù retro product can only be the desire of a sufficiently large number of people in our company to do this.</i>  <i>But understand, if we want to do the next part of Half-Life, while ignoring all that we have learned while working on Portal 2 and other multiplayer projects, we will make a mistake.</i>  <i>Thus, we want to say that we will continue to move forward, but this should not cause concern to our players, ‚Äù</i> said Gabe Newell.

      By making a squeeze from Gabe's interview, one can conclude that Half-life 3 will not see the light, and if the game is created, it will be more likely to resemble the previous parts of the franchise. <br><br>  Valve's position in the face of Gabe is clear.  Being a developer of such session multiplayer hits as Counter-Strike (1.6-GO), Team Fortress 2 and Dota 2, the company follows the current trend, and the F2P model of the last two and the sale of <a href="https://wiki.teamfortress.com/wiki/Cosmetic_items/ru">hats</a> and <a href="http://dota2.gamepedia.com/Treasure/ru">chests</a> (including in CS: GO) brings a decent profit.  It is also worth understanding that if Valve does release Half-Life 3, but it will not meet the expectations of players (overgrown ten years before the size of a small galaxy), the company will suffer serious damage to reputation.  So while Gabe and his team maintain the status quo: players are waiting and hoping for a masterpiece continuation of the adventures of the silent Gordon Freeman, but Valve is not developing it. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/366557/">https://habr.com/ru/post/366557/</a></p>
