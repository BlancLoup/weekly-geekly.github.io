    <blockquote>  Please be advised that today, April 6, 2010, at 22-00, it is possible to disable all Makhost services. <br><br>  Information about the disconnection was brought to the company Makhost 06.04.2010 at 19-06.  The shutdown was initiated by a third party Russian Space Systems OJSC (FGUP RNII KP), with which Makhost does not have any economic relations. <br><br>  According to the information of Russian Space Systems OJSC (FGUP RNII KP), the data center that houses the equipment of the Makhost company no longer belongs to Oversan-Mercury.  In addition, the equipment Makhosta illegally delayed on the territory of Russian Space Systems.  For details, contact (495) 509-12-02.  We apologize for the situation and will do everything possible to resolve it quickly. <br>  Respectfully, <br>  Makhost </blockquote><br><br>  And the second letter: <br>  <b>From:</b> McHost.Ru &lt;noreply@mchost.ru&gt; add <br>  <b>Sent:</b> April 14, 2010 at 7:14 pm <br><br><blockquote>  The company ‚ÄúOversan-Mercury‚Äù has spread false information about the nature of the economic and partner relations with the hosting provider ‚ÄúMakhost‚Äù. <br><br>  The Makhost company has a number of documents that objectively reflect the dynamics of the processes taking place in the Oversan holding on the eve of a break in relations. <br><br>  The Makhost company is a principled opponent of the clarification of relationships outside the legal field.  However, we strive to ensure that information about the activities of the companies included in the holding is submitted objectively and without distortion, without misleading the public.  You can get acquainted with documents, diagrams and photos by contacting Makhost at flove@mail.ru or by ICQ 384316136. <br><br>  Currently we can confirm the following: <br><br>  Hosting provider "Makhost" really entered into the holding "Oversan".  Leonich Yurlichich is a former founder of Makhosta, as evidenced by the records in the memorandum of association, as well as a number of other documents. <br><br>  The data center "Radar", located on the territory of OJSC RKS, was built on the request of the company "Makhost".  To gain access to the equipment, it was necessary to have a permit to work with state secrets, therefore the Makhost engineers were partly registered at ZAO NPO Space Instrument Making (a subsidiary of OJSC RCS). <br><br>  Because of this, there are never any permits or licenses for the Radar data center from Oversan-Mercury or RKS OJSC.  The communication channels of DC "Radar" with the Internet pass through the switching equipment "Oversan-Mercury", therefore in the outside world "Radar" is seen as part of the data-center "Oversan-Mercury". <br><br>  Finally, the Oversun-Mercury company has not handed over a communication center and cannot be handed over, since the optics up to communication centers M9 and M10 belong to OJSC RKS, all contracts with operators are concluded at OJSC RKS.  Racks of switching equipment on M9 and M10 belong to RKS OJSC.  Therefore, to date, the activity of ‚ÄúOversan-Mercury‚Äù is illegal. </blockquote><br><br>  There is a belief that large companies do not consider it their duty to comply with business ethics, this is further strengthened by a broad PR company in Habr√©. <br><br>  PS I have nothing to do with Oversan or Makhost, I am an outside attentive observer. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/91005/">https://habr.com/ru/post/91005/</a></p>
