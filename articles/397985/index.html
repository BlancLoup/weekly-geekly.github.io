Many already know that there are sensors that can be inserted into the disk, after which the pressure data will be transmitted to the main control unit.  But it would be good if the control unit of these sensors was already in the car.  Not all models of cars such a unit is installed by default.  But it does not matter - the monitoring system can be installed additionally. <br><br>  One of the variants of such a system is external sensors.  Sensors are caps on standard nipples.  Such a system is installed quickly, even an inexperienced motorist can cope with its installation.  There is no need to contact the auto repair shop .. In this version there are some minor drawbacks.  For example, a plump cap not on every wheel would look appropriate.  But the disadvantages here are still less than merits.  I installed such a system for my car, and I suggest to get acquainted with how it all works. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  So consider first what is in the box.  (the box itself and hard cardboard with a magnetic cover - already inspires confidence.

Measure pressure and temperature.  All this is transmitted via Bluetooth (including the battery status) to the telephone and to the internal additional indicator unit.  Caps can be black or silver.  A silver lettering - IMHO - it would be necessary to paint over so as not to catch the eye.  Batteries for 2 years. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e14/c9b/f09/e14c9bf09ce24516a5b439bb069d4dc0.jpg"><br><br>  Your phone number.  Part of the system.  Shows pressure / temperature / battery - each sensor.  Must have (and this is important) Bluetooth at least 4.0 and Android at least 4.3 (or iOS at least 7.1) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/de3/263/12a/de326312a73445f1958143fe0e4f1817.jpg"><br><br>  Internal additional unit.  Receives information from sensors in parallel with the phone.  Light bulging, showing on which wheel the problem is.  On batteries.  Connection and installation is not required.  Lives 2 years from batteries due to the internal motion sensor. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/052/e17/8a3/052e178a34ac4265b26eefd861aade7a.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/03f/d64/3fc/03fd643fc4a84cd883ed3bfc8dd5b3b6.jpg"><br><br>  Counter nuts on the nipple.  Roll up on the nipple in front of the sensor.  and are attracted special key.  So as not immediately screwed sensors.  (6 nuts and 2 keys included). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/31a/3f6/82f/31a3f682f9cc46b5b4d633dd6cd9ab00.jpg"><br><br>  Well, in reserve - 4 more tablet batteries for sensors, adhesive tape for the unit and a ring with a chain for the key.  Took care. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/38b/b21/9b4/38bb219b431a434da2ae431004ada16f.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/923/0c7/4c9/9230c74c93b249acbf513e9e64ae1f22.jpg"><br><br><h3>  main idea </h3><br>  Each sensor transmits via Bluetooth to the phone (in the program you want to install).  We ourselves establish the necessary pressure limits for the front and backside :) If the pressure goes beyond the limits recommended by the manufacturer, the program itself reminds us additionally. <br><br>  In parallel, the sensors transmit information to an additional unit.  If the pressure is below the desired one, the corresponding light in the unit flashes and beeps.  The role of the block - so that 1. you can get info if you go without a phone 2. Block - also plays the role of an identifier when registering a program account.  And without a block, stolen sensors will not work with another phone. <br><br><h3>  General installation algorithm </h3><br>  There are a number of tricks, when knowledge of dancing and a tambourine can come in handy.  But for a real gadget, this is only in the hunt.  So, we need to do the following: <br><br>  <strong>1.</strong> Download and install free software.  There are applications for Android and the App Store (iOS7 and Android 4.3 are supported). <br><br>  <strong>2.</strong> Register your account by entering your email.  No password needed.  Just enter the mail-check the received letter-click on the link.  And then - go to the program.  Constantly enter the login is not necessary. <br><br>  <strong>3.</strong> Now you need to register in the program (and so bind) the block.  Without this, it will not be possible to bind later sensors.  The unit has a unique number.  When then we tie the sensors, they will not work with another unit.  takes place - synchronization to the cloud. <br><br>  <strong>4.</strong> After the Block is registered - in turn - we register each sensor into the program. <br>  Actually, everything. <br><br><h3>  Using </h3><br>  Block - placed in the car, in the glove box.  When it starts to signal a problem, it can be identified by the corresponding light bulb - with which wheel the problem is.  In parallel, the data is transmitted to the phone, so that here too, you will see the condition of the wheels and batteries in the sensors.  I note that the smartphone inside the car does not always consistently receive the signal from the sensor (although I read this online, personally I always caught it).  The unit catches the signal guaranteed.  So the phone and the main unit of the system complement each other.  It is clear that you do not need to watch constantly.  If necessary, the system itself will tell you which wheel you need to pump. <br><br>  Under the sensor, you can install a locknut from the kit.  Then just turn off the sensor will not work (otherwise you can roll with the nipple).  And for releasing the nut there is a special key.  This is pretty good protection against theft of sensors. <br><br>  Several screenshots: <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/1de/86f/b48/1de86fb480584081ab7d37f67bbbc3f7.jpg" height="550"></div><br>  After pairing the car unit and connecting the sensors, a car account will appear in the program.  If desired, you can connect multiple devices on different machines.  This is convenient if your family or company has several cars. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/67c/886/681/67c8866813c74087accd41784b84a39d.jpg" height="550"></div><br>  Do not forget to set the right pressure levels for our cars. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/836/768/45c/83676845cc3c4a0ba8d9cc035183c36a.jpg" height="550"></div><br>  On the main screen, we see: <br><br>  - pressure in each wheel in convenient units (can be changed) <br>  - air temperature <br>  - date and time of the last measurement <br>  - sensor battery level <br>  - set level of nominal pressure <br>  - you can switch to another screen - additional sensors <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/dac/1fd/890/dac1fd8909d4485ab9a8364abe5ffc6b.jpg" height="550"></div><br>  Additional amenities: <br><br>  - connect from the program, and you can provide access to another person.  And then the owner of another account will also be able to see what is with the wheels (but will not be able to change the settings).  It can be useful for driving together / three of us, etc.  on one machine; <br>  - having bought sensors, they can be installed on a spare tire, trailer, etc .; <br>  - but in general the program can connect several machines with their systems; <br>  - if you want to transfer the entire system to another user - you need to untie the block from your copy of the program.  Then the system will forget the sensors. <br><br>  What did you like about the <a href="https://dadget.ru/izmeritel-davleniya-shin/%3Futm_referrer%3Dgeektimes.ru%26utm_source%3Dgeektimes.ru%26utm_medium%3Darticle%26utm_term%3Dizmeritel-davleniya-shin%26utm_content%3Dizmeritel-davleniya-shin%26utm_campaign%3Dizmeritel-davleniya-shin_321">FOBO Tire</a> tire pressure monitoring system: <br><br>  - in fact, just plugged in and use; <br>  - self-installation; <br>  - no installation in the car, connections, etc.  Block with velcro in the glove compartment and the screen in the phone.  And constantly look and do not need.  When it is necessary - it will signal itself and show; <br>  - show exactly.  You can clearly see the change in pressure as the wheel heats up; <br>  - An alternative is the sensors inside the disk + additional monitor + full unmounting of the wheels; <br>  - and you can also put on a motorcycle; <br>  - for Apple Watch owners - you can display info on the watch :) <br><br>  What you need to think about: <br><br>  - not everyone will like plump caps instead of the usual nipples. <br><br>  What the wheel sensor looks like is shown in two photos below: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/556/ade/19d/556ade19dac24ae2a0b91939ca058bc3.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/6d1/b4d/390/6d1b4d390b884951b3bb2efe1cb5dee1.jpg"><br><br>  The set is now offered on request.
