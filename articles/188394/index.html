What's new?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/b79/6a9/e43/b796a9e43dcb2576a4d94d895e00e3d3.jpg"><br><br>  Today, the thirtieth of July 2013, the day of the official start of sales of the new modification of the famous Google-tablet Nexus 7 from Asus.  However, the holiday atmosphere is not particularly felt, and all because this device is already being sold and bought in America.  Having decided not to wait for the official release of the tablet, such large retailers as Amazon or, for example, BestBuy started selling Nexus 7 2013 four days ago - 07/26/13. <br><br>  Is this release interesting?  Definitely, especially given the fact that Google managed very well to tweak the combination of "price / quality" and made the tablet much more attractive to buy. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Another good news is that you can buy a new Nexus 7 on <a href="http%253A%252F%252Fwww.amazon.com%252Fgp%252Fproduct%252FB00DVFLJDS%252Fref%253Das_li_ss_tl%253Fie%253DUTF8%2526camp%253D1789%2526creative%253D390957%2526creativeASIN%253DB00DVFLJDS%2526linkCode%253Das2%2526tag%253Dqwintrycom-20%26sa%3DD%26sntz%3D1%26usg%3DAFQjCNFIJyVWHnwBVWHWRemHFQz6ljahdg">Amazon</a> , and at the lowest price available today, which means that you will not need to fuss with the deception of the Good Corporation.

    <h4>  Characteristics of the device </h4><br><br>  And now a little about the hero of the occasion!  However, just presenting the characteristics of the new Nexus 7 is not very interesting.  It is much more interesting to compare them with what was before and what became after: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/2dd/5d2/525/2dd5d252553906fc81e2b57c05eff340.png"><br><br>  Well noticeable, the new Nexus is significantly superior to its analogue last year.  And it can be seen in almost everything, but what really catches your eye is the magnificent screen resolution, which provides a decent pixel density of 323 ppi. <br><br>  Another innovation - Asus engineers have added a simple five-megapixel camera module to the new tablet.  In our time, this almost did not affect the price, but added another function (although it is not often used, but still nice). <br><br><h5>  Battery </h5><br>  It would seem - why in the new model, at a time when power growth is obvious, did you install a smaller battery?  Perhaps Asus decided to cheat a little by equipping the Nexus 7 with a more economical iron and slightly reducing its dimensions due to this?  Maybe!  After all, the device has really become much thinner, lighter, and somewhere even smaller.  However, nevertheless, the battery life not only did not decrease, but even grew a little - the full charge of the new Nexus is now enough to watch 9 hours of HD video, while its brother last year is already deflated by this time. <br><br><h5>  Appearance </h5><br>  Also, thanks to the work on the bugs, Asus managed to achieve a rather attractive design for modest money.  Last year‚Äôs experience suggested that it was better to spend some money, but to put the device‚Äôs appearance in order, because in 2012 there was a lot of shouting about it, especially those who set Nexus as an example of the notorious iPad, famous for a very attractive ‚Äúwrapper‚Äù. <br><br>  To sum up, we can say that the new Nexus 7 is probably the most interesting 7-inch tablet today.  Considering his price, characteristics and design, he establishes complete and unconditional hegemony in this segment of technological goods. <br><br><h4>  Purchase </h4><br>  As mentioned above, a huge plus of the new Nexus 7 is the ability to buy it on the good old Amazon, which has no accounts with either our country or our credit cards.  Of course, the seller will not send his goods to Russia, however, it‚Äôs easy to get the <a href="https://qwintry.com/ru/nexus7">address of a mediator in the United States</a> . <br><br>  Buy Nexus 7 16GB today you can for <a href="http%253A%252F%252Fwww.amazon.com%252Fgp%252Fproduct%252FB00DVFLJDS%252Fref%253Das_li_ss_tl%253Fie%253DUTF8%2526camp%253D1789%2526creative%253D390957%2526creativeASIN%253DB00DVFLJDS%2526linkCode%253Das2%2526tag%253Dqwintrycom-20%26sa%3DD%26sntz%3D1%26usg%3DAFQjCNFIJyVWHnwBVWHWRemHFQz6ljahdg">$ 229</a> , and 32GB version for <a href="http%253A%252F%252Fwww.amazon.com%252Fgp%252Fproduct%252FB00DVFLJKQ%252Fref%253Das_li_ss_tl%253Fie%253DUTF8%2526camp%253D1789%2526creative%253D390957%2526creativeASIN%253DB00DVFLJKQ%2526linkCode%253Das2%2526tag%253Dqwintrycom-20%26sa%3DD%26sntz%3D1%26usg%3DAFQjCNELOPR1awiLVxZB49zULgde09mLFw">$ 269</a> <br><br>  Considering the weight of the kit: 1.2 pounds (of which, after consolidation and removal of all advertising waste paper, approximately 1 pound will remain) you can very easily calculate the cost of sending a new Nexus 7 to Russia: <br><br>  Mail services, packaging, insurance and money transfer fees for a <a href="https://qwintry.com/ru/nexus7">parcel</a> post will cost us from about $ 65 to $ 72 - depending on the device version and delivery method. <br><br>  If you send two tablets at once, the delivery price will be from $ 86 to $ 90, respectively! <br><br>  Thus, it is obvious that it is much more profitable to send several tablets to Russia at once.  But even taking into account the cost of sending only one copy, we get a device with an unbeatable combination of cost and characteristics.  And how much the device will cost on the Russian shelves, we can only guess. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/188394/">https://habr.com/ru/post/188394/</a></p>
