Server resources are not used and 10%, so the idea why not earned lodged in my head.

      This idea had to be thought out to the smallest detail.  I wanted not only to pay for myself, but at least a little, but to earn.  Realizing that you won‚Äôt earn $ 2 on a hosting, I decided that I would take a much larger amount from customers.  Naturally, the question immediately arose of how to find customers willing to pay the same amount for hosting and how to compete with hosting for $ 2. <br><br>  By asking myself, what do I get paid for in my main job?  I understood two things for myself.  First, I get paid for my knowledge.  Secondly - for the work itself. <br><br>  This prompted me to the idea that my potential client is an <b>organization, at least connected with the computer sphere</b> . <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  First, as a rule, an organization is ready to pay more than a private client. <br>  Secondly, the less such an organization possessed computer knowledge, the more I could sell my knowledge and services to it. <br><br>  Surveys of acquaintances and some organizations (with which I dealt at work) showed that they would rather pay a living person than enter a visa number on the site. <br>  This is easily explained - live communication inspires confidence in them, hence I made a conclusion - <b>compulsory communication with the client, at least by telephone</b> . <br><br>  Despite the fact that today, probably all hosting companies advertise <b>24/7 phone support</b> , at the stage of concluding a contract a representative of such an office is still virtual. <br><br>  Next was built a list of potential customers, it fell into: <br>  museums, theaters, social movements and some other small organizations. <br><br>  <b>So what can you pay for besides the usual hosting services?</b> <br>  Since my clients are far from everything related to <b>IT</b> , I suggested that they solve ‚Äúpractically any‚Äù problems associated with sites.  Such clients are turned off by words like ftp / php / dns / ssh.  What will take me 5 minutes to do, it will take many hours and a lot of tedious calls with ‚Äústupid questions‚Äù.  I got this experience at the main job: when making websites, I had to give some support to them, even if they were built on a CMS like <b>Wordpress</b> or <b>Joomla</b> , customers still had almost anecdotal questions. <br><br>  <b>How did I look for clients?</b> <br>  To be honest, the first ten are organizations already familiar to me. For the second ten I left through the first clients. <br><br>  If to summarize all of the above, then: <br><ul><li>  I provide services only to organizations far from the computer sphere </li><li>  looking for customers myself and through friends </li><li>  one hosting plan (up to 3GB of space / unlimited traffic) </li><li>  I do not have a website </li><li>  I do not advertise anywhere </li><li>  no online billing </li><li>  signed contract only </li><li>  give some support in their sites </li><li>  Clients do not use the control panel (they simply don‚Äôt need it), so a free equivalent of paid cpanel and Parallels Plesk was taken </li><li>  backups are made to an external server (which is at my disposal for services about its administration) </li><li>  all clients (except one) from the city where I live </li></ul><br><br>  Now in numbers: <br><ul><li>  today 24 customers </li><li>  one VDS server ($ 40 per month) </li><li>  tariff plan - $ 30 per month </li><li>  minimum payment for 12 months (it saves me every month to do the routine associated with the transfer of money) </li><li>  all clients together I spend about 20 hours a month (mostly small questions from the series ‚Äúhow to reduce the image in the correct proportion for the site‚Äù) </li><li>  these 20 hours include everyday viewing of server status logs and backups </li></ul><br><br>  After learning about the features of some organizations, I offered them a new service for them - mail hosting and administration.  For them it was a headache, for me it was - reset the password, open a new mailbox, etc.  This is a separate service for $ 30 per month.  11 clients use it.  These 11 customers do not want to go to the control panel and add something there, so I would prefer to do it. <br><br>  In order to sign contracts, I had to officially register and pay taxes. <br><br>  <b>As a result, for each month:</b> <br>  - $ 40 per server <br>  $ 30 * 24 = $ 720 for hosting <br>  $ 30 * 11 = $ 330 for hosting and administering mail <br>  $ 850 after taxes <br><br>  If you divide it into work hours, then it turns out to be $ 42.5 per hour, not bad at all, considering that hosting is just my hobby. <br><br>  I have no further plans to develop my hosting, so I‚Äôm no longer looking for new customers.  This is explained by the fact that being a hoster is not my favorite occupation, and at the initial stage I set the bar at 20-30 hours per month for this business. <br><br>  Nevertheless, for me it is a very interesting experience.  If you find the right approach to customers and provide them with the necessary knowledge and experience, you can easily compete with hosters for $ 2.  I think this experience can be applied in other areas. <br><br>  <b>UPDATE</b> <br>  The technical side of the case: <br><ul><li>  <a href="http://www.rackspacecloud.com/">Rackspacecloud server</a> </li><li>  512MB RAM </li><li>  20 GB HDD </li><li>  <a href="http://www.virtualmin.com/">virtualmin</a> control panel </li></ul><br><br>  <b>UPDATE 2</b> <br>  In case of holidays, weekends, etc.  my assistant is working on the server.  Calls from the official company number are simply redirected to him.  Payment by the hour of work. <br>  Over the past year he never had to work. <br><br>  Good luck, in your endeavors and success in the new year! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/111050/">https://habr.com/ru/post/111050/</a></p>
