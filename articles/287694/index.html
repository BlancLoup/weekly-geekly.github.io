  <section class="page js-page"><h1>As we launched a TV channel on the Internet. Idea</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  I do not have a clear answer to the question, why so far no one has made a channel about dogs?  There are all kinds!  Movies and music, travel and cooking, fashion and health, business and religion, cars and sports - more than a dozen of football.  After all, dogs and people who love dogs live in all corners of the world.  And what kind of feelings and emotions our four-legged friends can cause both their owners and everyone around them - there's nothing to say about it. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Despite the fact that in my case the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãcreating a thematic TV channel about dogs lies on the surface, it took time, courage, and, I would even say, audacity to wipe at the whole CHANNEL.  I clearly remember that moment when it ‚Äúdawned on me‚Äù.  When connected to a single point of understanding a few simple things: <br>  1. Actively progressive interest of the audience to view specialized channels <br>  2. Obvious need of dog lovers for high-quality television thematic product. <br>  3. Infinity of the topic <br>  4. Vast experience and archive of materials <br>  5. People with whom you can move mountains <br>  6. And most importantly: this is what I know, love and know how to do best! <br><br>  That is, I suddenly realized that all of the above is <b>exactly what is needed to launch a channel</b> .

      Of course, going on a satellite is cool.  But expensive and troublesome.  But to access the Internet you do not need to get a license, you do not need to pay money for satellite rental, you do not need to deal with cable operators, who, in fact, have to deliver the channel to the direct consumer, the viewer. <br><br>  That is, to realize the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãa TV channel, of course, is much easier on the Internet, at least cheaper.  What is attractive to start. <br><br>  Naturally, it is by no means a question of saving on the production of video content.  That is, these are full-fledged television programs and a full-fledged TV channel - with an idea, permanent headings, a broadcasting network, filming and editing. <br><br>  Of course, ‚Äúniche‚Äù dictates a certain specificity.  For example, the timing of the interview, the duration of the television plan.  More precisely, in this case does not "dictate", but, I would say, allows you to turn around to the fullest.  How many times have we brought videos from the World Exhibitions of 10-12 hours, and went on the air for an hour and a half.  While the interest of the ‚Äúnarrow‚Äù audience to this content is very high!  Do not feed any professional dog breeder with bread, let me see how the champion runs around the ring, how he is folded, how his limbs work and how his wool flutters.  In addition, this party, "dog", I mean, oh, is very extensive.  400 breeds of dogs, almost every breed has its own characteristics of breeding, raising, keeping, grooming, breeding, handling.  Competitions, competitions, championships!  All-breed, mono-breed, club and world shows!  Pet industry and veterinary medicine are moving by leaps and bounds!  The list of topics is endless! <br><br>  Of course, as in any business, it is important that professionals do it.  I mean, cynology professionals.  The availability and ease of placing information on the Internet, unfortunately, is not directly proportional to its quality.  Sometimes you read it ... Well, you know!  Videos for Dog Channel TV are prepared in close cooperation with experienced dog trainers, dog training instructors, leading veterinary clinics - in short, true professionals of their field. <br><br>  Of course, the whole idea is based on a <b>personal interest</b> in this topic as a whole.  I can talk about dogs for as long as I like with a beginner and with a professional, both with an expert and with an athlete, with a trainer, with a handler, a dog hairdresser and a veterinarian.  I will have what to ask and what to tell.  I think this is very important when the process manager is in the subject. <br><br>  I very much hope that my story will inspire someone, suggest an idea, give courage, and become the very missing puzzle in the picture ‚ÄúI am creating a new project‚Äù.  In any case, such stories act very positively on me personally!  I deliberately do not write about difficulties so far - it‚Äôs not necessary to think that they don‚Äôt exist, ‚ÄúI have them‚Äù  But if I concentrated on the difficulties at the very beginning (and now also), analyzed and calculated, and acted according to the rules, as it is written in smart books, then nothing would have happened. <br><br>  I remember an amazing phrase that the Weiner brothers put into the mouth of the brilliant master Nicolo Amati: ‚ÄúThe violins do not.  Make barrels and benches.  And violins, like bread, grapes and children, give birth and cultivate. " <br><br>  There is nothing to add here.  And we are not geniuses.  It‚Äôs just that each of us has a ‚Äúviolin‚Äù in life - a barrel, a factory or a TV channel. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/287694/">https://habr.com/ru/post/287694/</a></p>
