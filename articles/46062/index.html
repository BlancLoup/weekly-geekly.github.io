  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Startup: "Startup Cemetery"</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Every day there are several (dozens?) Ideas of IT-projects, the authors of which seriously decide to take up their implementation.  Someone takes on the project alone, someone - gathers enthusiastic friends, someone hires developers for his own money, someone finds investors.  Someone turns out the project the way he thought of himself; someone, he is very different from the original vision.  But most projects, as practice shows, cease to be supported and / or closed. <br><br>  I came up with the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãan Internet project, the main purpose of which is to provide everyone with detailed information about startups that had sunk into oblivion.  This information will include a detailed description of the ‚Äúidea‚Äù and business model of the project, as well as the analytical part: an interview with the project founders about the history of the project, and the reasons why the project did not shoot;  as well as the opinion of a person competent in the Internet business on these very reasons.  Such a person can be any ‚Äúsuccessful‚Äù start-up person who can be used by the editors as an expert, and in his experience tries to understand the reasons for the closure of a third-party project. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>  <b>What will users get?</b> <br>  Users will get a huge piggy bank of experience. <br>  People who have no experience in developing their projects, but those who want to do such a project will see ‚Äúhow not to do it‚Äù.  Or, at least, they will understand the risk of certain actions.  Also, having read the conclusions of the experts (and the comments of other users) they will be able to make a picture of how to most effectively overcome certain crisis situations.

      <b>What will the authors of "closed startups" get?</b> <br>  First of all, the authors of ‚Äúunsuccessful‚Äù startups will get a second chance: someone might be interested in their idea, and seeing real opportunities for reanimation of the project - to allocate funds for revision and correction of some moments. <br>  Secondly, the authors will get a versatile and unbiased look at their project, and they may discover something that was not visible from their position as developers - the true reasons that led to the closure of the project. <br>  And thirdly, the authors of startups will be able to transfer their valuable experience to other people - I am sure that all people have such a need. <br><br>  <b>What will invited experts get?</b> <br>  Experts will have the opportunity to advertise their own projects, their successful development teams, and themselves :) <br><br>  <b>What will the administration of this startup?</b> <br>  First, it will be acquaintances - both with different people and with different projects.  The experience of journalism, and in a very interesting niche.  Secondly, since the audience will be niche - startups + investors, they can be introduced to each other through various seminars / conferences, and receive money for advertising such events.  Third, you can advertise outsource developers, popular software engines, technologies, etc.  tools for startups. <br><br>  Such are the thoughts. <br>  As far as I know, there are still no such projects on the Internet.  If someone wants to implement such a project - I will only be happy, there is no copyright on the idea. <br>  In general, I would also like to get "versatile and unbiased" reviews :) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/46062/">https://habr.com/ru/post/46062/</a></p>
