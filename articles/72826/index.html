I mean the HTC Hero (A6262). <br>  I myself have long waited for him to appear in Russia.  and so! <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  I will say right away - I expected the box to see another one.  Absolutely not typical for HTC box.  Beauty. <br>  Attaching photo. <br><br>  Immediately visible on the box is a sticker stating that the GPS Sygic navigation program is included (and, accordingly, the new firmware). <br>  By the way, I never tried the CJ, I gave the device a test, but the CJ number is tied to it. <br>  Also on the box is the inscription "for sale only in Russia" and the hologram of the NTS: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/d00/8be/dbd/d008bedbd89b2709f516b1ffb4cda34c.jpg"><br><br>  Inside the box is: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/08b/cf7/2a9/08bcf72a9e8c20bc57b44dd67db9a548.jpg"><br>  - a bunch of bukletikov and reminders about what kind of NTS caring company (reminded books from the iPhone) <br>  - in a caring bed - the Hero himself <br>  - slightly lower in the sections and bags of accessories - charger (composite: the unit itself, an adapter for an euro socket, an usb-cord extusb, a headset) <br>  Speaking of headset: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/33b/489/d6f/33b489d6f539d6a8fb5e3cfe7847a2e4.jpg"><br>  on the wire is a mini-remote.  nicely.  volume control on the device itself (it works in the locked mode), player control is here.  the microphone is right there. <br>  The ears themselves are quite tolerable (for complete sets).  The bag still has cotton tips and a clothespin for the headset. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/c74/8a0/2ff/c748a02ffc8e3280cb84142f6e5e58d5.jpg"><br>  the familiar extusb (by the way, it was quite easy to be replaced with the usual mini USB cable)

    <h1>  Hero brothers </h1><br>  Immediately make a reservation - I am the owner of the iPhone.  true, not a propagandist, not an idealist. <br>  Therefore, the comparison will be more or less objective. <br>  Ask ‚Äúwhy 3g when there are 3gs?‚Äù - because it doesn‚Äôt matter ‚Äútwice as fast‚Äù and autofocus with a compass.  At least in this review - it does not matter. <br>  Let's start the comparison ... <br>  Here, to begin with - physically. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/3ab/865/3ab/3ab8653abae6cddd271a7a8c143b7deb.jpg"><br>  The iPhone is slightly wider, the Hero is slightly thicker. <br>  Matte vs. glossy. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/a9e/67e/9ba/a9e67e9ba57a34deb8d38d623d3779da.jpg"><br>  Obviously ... Or vice versa?  :) <br><br>  The hero's screen is slightly smaller.  When used, it seems tangible.  In fact - a bit. <br>  He twisted the brightness of both to the maximum, the hero is dimmer ... <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/3e3/26b/ea4/3e326bea4349646c64229a6c57c150f2.jpg"><br>  By the way, it is clear that when designing a hero (or when incarnated) - they repelled from an iPhone. <br>  It can be seen on the glass on the screen, on the capacitive sensor, on the accelerometer, on gestures, on the metal border of the screen, on the added buttons, on the plastic * matte! * Of the cover.  around see.  even the location of the elements (the port below, the volume on the left, the ears on the top left) ... <br><br>  Unbiased views believe that looks more profitable iPhone.  Taking in hand - more convenient Hero. <br>  They weigh the same.  In the hand of the Hero is safer. <br>  Colleagues at work spoke about the ergonomics of the hero does not matter.  I am left-handed.  It is very convenient for me to take him by the protrusion and control the buttons, trackball. <br><br><h1>  Important differences </h1><br>  The most important difference is the openness of the platform.  Android attracts me with its openness and ease of learning. <br>  Of course, I do not argue, for the iPhone, KFOR is the most popular among mobile programmers.  But what prevents such become Android?  I think the low prevalence of devices. <br>  Synchronization with a computer ... No crutches.  What you want is what it is. <br>  HTC Sync - sync everything a la Aytunz. <br>  Data transfer - copy as on a flash drive! <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/comment_images/6f0/b84/ad4/6f0b84ad4b208fcbe215a31138ef951a.jpg"><br>  Video converted for iPhone swallowed by the Hero as his own, rejoiced and played it =) <br>  The behavior when playing music from the Hero copies Aifonovskoe. <br>  Listened to music.  He took out the headphones - was silent. <br>  But.  I caught a glitch.  I watch the video in the headset - I often go on the bus and watch ‚ÄúMythbusters‚Äù - and so. <br>  In the iPhone I press "turn" - the player closes.  I put the phone in my pocket.  I press the button on the headset.  Starts to play music. <br>  Drove.  Stopped.  Worked.  Released.  I opened the player - press the headset button - watch the video.  Everything is close and convenient. <br>  In the hero - I watch the video.  I shake my face.  Stops.  I shake play - music plays.  I take it out.  I am watching a video.  I shake play - music plays.  the video stops.  to play the video - you just need to click in the player.  can not habitually? <br>  The volume of the iPhone more (in the ears). <br>  But the hero's speaker is louder and richer. <br><br>  IPhone can not be unlocked only with a button - you need a meaningful holding your finger across the screen.  The hero just press the turn, then the menu and he is in front of you. <br>  The iPhone also has a convenient lever for switching to silent mode. <br>  But the hero has a trackball - in the cold not to take off his gloves and not to carry his nose around the screen.  And also the button to search, hang up, send a call, cancel (return), at home, menu ... it is completely not to the detriment of ergonomics ... <br>  You can use the YUSB hero through a familiar mini-usb, while with an iPhone you can use it through a familiar iPod cable. <br>  The hero has an indication of charging and missed signals by LEDs. <br>  The hero has autofocus (3G also has, I know). <br>  The hero has a memory card (but only 2 GB in the kit) <br>  Finally, the Hero has Google ... True and the iPhone has not been forgotten yet. <br><br>  For software - everything that can be done on the iPhone - is done on Hero.  however, there are not so many beautiful transitions and smooth flowing.  Well, okay.  Maybe Apple has a patent? <br>  Multitouch in iPhone everywhere, right there - in the browser, in pictures.  I used to try to enlarge the map with a ‚Äúpinch‚Äù - it did not work out.  It is necessary to poke in the "+" and "-" on the screen. <br>  By usability easier to deal with the iPhone.  With him, even the child will understand.  But constantly pressing the "menu" and "return" buttons is not very convenient. <br>  To get to the main menu - you need to press "home".  Clicking on the "turn" - turn off the screen.  At the iPhone upside.  Accidentally harder to click. <br>  And the Hero's trackball blinks nicely with missed reminders. <br>  It is possible for the Hero to put any melody on the bell  Straight from the player. <br>  In general ... In general ... <br><br>  What the iPhone has is everyone knows.  Army of fans. <br>  I think that the Hero of the fans will also turn out. <br>  If I had the opportunity, I would have walked with both devices. <br>  In the meantime, I'm testing the Hero and using the iPhone. <br><br>  A small epilogue (based on discussions): <br>  The review was not planned as something especially independent. <br>  There is no review of the software component, because for example, here: <a href="http://www.mforum.ru/phones/tests/090475.htm">tyts</a> , <a href="http://www.mobile-review.com/articles/2009/htc-project-3-hero.shtml">here</a> and others like them. <br>  The article has no conclusion as such - because everyone will make a conclusion himself. <br><br>  For me, the conclusion is that the first step (I mean the step of Android to Russia) is excellent.  We are waiting for the rest.  I hope that it will meet all expectations and surpass them. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/72826/">https://habr.com/ru/post/72826/</a></p>
