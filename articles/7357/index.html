  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Family 2.0</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  A lot has been written about the effect of social networks, blogs and other Web 2.0 in general on real life.  The fact that this is a break of the foundations of society, emerging over the centuries, the New Era.  And indeed, I thought, stroking my shirts last night, while my beautiful wife was surfing the Internet, nothing undermines the foundations like changing the base.  In our case, from ancient times, the foundation of society was the Family (1.0?) - the father of the breadwinner, the wife of the mistress and the children who support the old parents. <br>  ‚ÄúBut why are you YOUR ironing shirts while your wife is alive?‚Äù Asks an inexhaustible reader, the answer is simple as a mouse movement - because I WANTED so. <br>  So, <a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b>Rule number 1</b> Family 2.0: <b>do what you WANT</b> .  Why all these conventions and patterns?  You want - my dishes, you want - smooth shirt, you want - cook, you want - watch the Internet, not paying attention to the traditions and opinion of the crowd.  Want to walk upside down?  - you are welcome!  Of course, you need to listen to the opinion of the other members (participants?) Of the family, this implies <br>  <b>Rule number 2</b> : <b>Evaluate and listen to the estimates</b> .  From the assessment of your actions depends on your "weight" in the family.  Moreover, the assessment of others and passers-by does not matter, the main appraisers are your relatives.  If the assessment of your actions is negative, then it is time to think about changing behavior, if the assessment is extremely positive, then this is a reason to rejoice.  Of course, you yourself must take an active part in the assessment of ALL actions, keep nothing in yourself, notice the little things.  After all, it is very simple to say in passing: ‚ÄúThank you for the clean dishes‚Äù, how simple and how important! <br>  <b>Rule number 3</b> : <b>mobility</b> .  Family 2.0 is mobile.  This of course does not mean that we should live in tents and cook food on the fire, no, it means that the time between the decision to go somewhere / go / fly and the action should be minimal, because this is an extra reason to get new information impressions. <br>  <b>Rule number 4</b> : <b>INFORMATION</b> = information + reading.  You are always aware of the latest REAL events (not TV news tales), you have something to say in almost any topic of conversation, you know WHERE to find information and you RECEIVE and USE this information.  Do I have to say that members of Family 2.0 are having rich, <i>healthy</i> conversations among themselves. <br>  <b>Rule number 5</b> : taking care of your <b>HEALTH</b> should be as much a part of everyday life as taking care of each other.  Instead of an evening beer - a small run, instead of the morning television "Talk Show" - charging.  And in a healthy body and a healthy mind and a healthy attitude towards others, and in general everything is healthy! <br><br>  Perhaps for our society, these rules are still alien, but if we strive for this, then it will be nice when our HEALTHY children WANT to easily fall for us to say Thanks and tell the latest news from their interesting life. </div>
