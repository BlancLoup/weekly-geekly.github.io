  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Forms in online stores designed by investigators threatened</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Every week I order on the Internet.  Washing machines, books, dishes - most of my house was bought on the Internet.  And it all came with couriers who swore at the lack of change, got the wrong address and specified a hundred times how to get there. <br><br>  I perceive it rather painfully, because I am engaged in the analysis and normalization of contact data and I know that user data can be collected from the first time correctly. <br><br>  Once again decided to order a blender. <br>  I chose it in five stores and wrote down my impressions. 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>

          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      I must say that I did not master most of the forms. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c7b/b5f/584/c7bb5f584147481f949fd7b705b81d92.png"><br><br>  Usually the store needs a name to get a customer in CRM.  Both surname and patronymic are demanded here.  Patronymic, why?  Are they going to talk to me officially? <br><br>  It also seems to me that the mailing address "March 8, 1-12" will definitely require clarification by the operator.  In Moscow, there is the street "March 8", "March 8 1st" and "March 8 4th."  And also "March 8" is in the village of Vnukovo, which is also in Moscow. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  I also do not know how the store uses my data.  Is e-mail to send spam?  Or to have insurance in case of an erroneous phone number?  Or write to the post office if I was on the subway while they called? <br><br>  You can simply sign the fields, as we did on <a href="http://www.dadata.ru/">dadata.ru</a> : <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/1f6/c85/b78/1f6c85b784b1484cb6a351f7c9632e05.png"><br><br>  Before that, we just had a form with the fields "Name" and "Mail."  The form accumulated 12% of garbage values ‚Äã‚Äãin usernames per month.  "Respect", "Nurse" and other characters were our best friends. <br><br>  After we signed the fields and included the <a href="https://dadata.ru/suggestions">Name Tips</a> , the amount of garbage among active users dropped to one case per month (0.01%). <br><br><br><h1>  Shop number two </h1><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/682/4e4/0da/6824e40da574494a94db6a6855e18319.png"><br><br>  The input form so tired me with my appearance that I immediately closed the window. <br><br><br><h1>  Shop number three </h1><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/582/997/7bd/5829977bd64947baa95b1b8c1a3ace3e.png"><br><br>  I clicked on the ‚ÄúAddress from Yandex profile‚Äù button, and after the ‚ÄúOK‚Äù pair on the pop-up windows, strange krakozyabry were substituted into the fields, which I had once indicated in my Yandex profile in my youth. <br><br>  It also embarrassed me that by filling out my e-mail, I automatically agree to receive letters.  And if I want not letters, but order status by e-mail?  Unclear. <br><br>  She was embarrassed and did not order. <br><br><br><h1>  Shop number four </h1><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/3af/56c/ab6/3af56cab66604e36a2d0c0caff644a99.png"><br><br>  I liked this form.  Name and phone, nothing more. <br>  If the address did not occupy half a page and <a href="https://dadata.ru/suggestions/">was entered in one line</a> , then in general there would be beauty. <br><br>  As on the form below. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/5f2/e1e/5ee/5f2e1e5ee1a24b46989e958855ccd50f.png"><br><br>  When I started to enter the work address, everything was great, - the tip of ‚ÄúTurchaninov‚Äù was highlighted, and I chose the street.  True, it was embarrassing that in the presence of the ‚Äústructure‚Äù field, the structure still got into the house. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a28/449/e7a/a28449e7ab0d4a3ea6d0ef74ffd3012f.png"><br><br>  But then I changed my mind and began to enter the home, "the 3rd Frunze ...".  The tip is gone.  I tried several options and realized that the store requires Frunzenskaya 3rd Street! <br><br>  And the card itself at the bottom of the form is funny sausage.  While entering the street, the marker is worn in different places, the process is fascinating. <br><br><br><h1>  Shop number five </h1><br>  This store was shocked by the fact that I hadn‚Äôt bought anything yet, and he had already written me down to customers by sending an SMS message: ‚ÄúHello, Man.  We have accepted your order.  We start processing ... ".  The era of personalized communications. <br><br>  The shop advised to drag the marker on the map to clarify the address.  I started to move the marker on the smallest scale and got into the landscape reserve Troparevsky.  Maybe I'm just a fool.  In general, the map is a very sticky game, you look at it, you carry a marker and you forget why you came.  After a couple of minutes, I remembered why I was here, returned to the site of store number four and ordered a blender. <br><br>  So, practical tips: <br><ol><li>  Do not force the user to enter everything at once - usually just a name and some contact.  The remaining fields are optional. </li><li>  If you make address prompts yourself, consider the different spelling of the same street (Frunzenskaya 3rd, 3rd Frunzenskaya, Crystal lane, Crystal Lane, etc.). </li><li>  In case of collisions of the names, please specify which settlement you are talking about (or center-outskirts). </li><li>  Do not frighten the user with an abundance of input fields. </li><li>  Avoid special effects with the map, if it does not make choosing the address more convenient. </li><li>  Sign the fields and explain why you need data. </li></ol></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/245363/">https://habr.com/ru/post/245363/</a></p>
