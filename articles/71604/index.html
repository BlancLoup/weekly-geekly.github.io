  <section class="page js-page"><h1>FOSS projects in Russia</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  We have recently reviewed information on Russian projects for the development of open source software for the business and found a lot of interesting things.  For example, did you know that there is an open KIS in Russia?  There, it turns out, is called Millenium BSA, and the developer has discovered codes for quite some time.  At the same time, there is no noise even in the open-market market - it‚Äôs clear that the guys are sitting in Samara, they are trying to make at least a local business, resources for normal promotion are not enough for sure.  It is not clear, by the way, how a business is doing - others at least put their own open software on some Oracle and have a piece of bread and butter in this way.  And these seemingly even global partnerships are not observed.  Meanwhile, it is in terms of accounting systems that Russian projects that initially take into account our accounting specifics easily beat Western ones, especially in small business.  It would be useful for admins on Mother Russia to know that there is such an open system. <br><br>  On the other hand, some strange holes-gaps in the Russian SPO-development space were discovered.  Where, it is asked, domestic SPO-graphics and modeling?  Well, well, CAD-CAE is a specific narrow market, at least there won't be anyone coming from the Russian open source software community, if at all.  But really, no one in Russia was tempted to write and open a program for 3D animation, just for fun?  Runet is silent, does not take anything to the shore. <br><br>  In this sense, the <a href="http://www.linuxcenter.ru/lib/press/foss_contest.phtml">contest ‚ÄúThe Best Free Project of Russia‚Äù</a> , announced by Linux Format magazine, is a very good undertaking.  It‚Äôs not even just about money, although half a million people also don‚Äôt roll on the road and regional developers wouldn‚Äôt stop them nowadays.  But for the common cause, it is equally important that according to the results of the competition a map of open source projects of Russia (and neighboring countries) will be compiled.  It is then that it will be possible to understand that from Russian free development it is already quite usable in business and at home (because not only developers, but also satisfied users can apply), where to take it and which niches are not yet occupied (if anyone wonders what he would do at his leisure). </div>
