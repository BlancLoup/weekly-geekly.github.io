There are no simple and correct decisions, which, moreover, will please everyone.  Moreover, in my opinion, a simple change in the payment scheme is not enough to resolve the cultural crisis provoked by copyright (yes, I consider today's situation a cultural crisis - if anyone is interested, I can express my views in more detail in a separate article ). <br><br>  However, I still have some specific considerations.  Let me share it.

    <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  1. The right of a citizen to access the information fund should be fundamental.  The author, publishing the work, enters into public relations, which impose a number of rights and obligations on him and on society. <br><br>  Society undertakes to ensure the protection of his interests to the author.  The author in return provides his work for free non-commercial use. <br><br>  Do you want your copyright protected?  No problems.  You provide the state with your work in a clearly defined format (for example, for music - mp3 256 kb, Lame encoder; for video - 1.5 Mbps, Ogg Theora with clearly defined settings).  This file is laid out on a publicly accessible public server.  In return, the state ensures that anyone who tries to gain commercial benefit from the use of a work regularly releases the relying part of the profit to the author (in particular, the holders of alternative servers on which the ad is running).  If the author swindles and gives a poor-quality rip - the Federal Service for Supervision of Consumer Rights and the Federal Penitentiary Inspectorate deals with him and fines him on the amount of loss of profit by the citizens. <br><br>  2. There should be no monopoly on the commercial distribution of copyright objects.  Any entrepreneur has the right to publish any work.  The law or the author himself fixes a specific percentage of the proceeds that the publisher is obliged to pay the author.  Everything.  Here, however, there are some troubles (for example, with managing the distribution of income between the author of the album and the author of the illustration for the publication of the album), but everything is completely solved, in my opinion. <br><br>  In such a situation, film companies do not lose anything in particular - rental and this is arranged approximately according to this principle (the distributor puts 50% in his pocket), nobody prohibits selling Blu-Ray. <br><br>  In principle, musicians don't care - their income is concerts.  Authors of songs (if they are not performers) receive their percentage from the performers.  The fate of the "major" does not bother anyone except themselves. <br><br>  The situation with books is more complicated - while many prefer to hold a paper book in their hands.  But with the mass distribution of readers, the situation will change.  But here, there is nothing unsolvable. <br><br>  At the same time, the legislation acquires a more or less legitimate character: to make a profit and not share with the author is bad;  The distribution of information is absolutely free and does not depend on any major. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/86919/">https://habr.com/ru/post/86919/</a></p>
