Even psychologists confirm this.  The option when it is the bosses who got it will not be considered.  Consider the option when the authorities, in general, nothing to do with it.  Tired of this position and work on someone in principle. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  This thought occurred to me not once or twice.  A couple of times I went on a perilous journey through the waves of freelancing, but very quickly realized that money (and their amount) is directly proportional to a) knowledge;  b) dating;  c) time (which is money). <br>  Realizing that freelancing is not for me, but I want to work for myself (or rather distribute profits on other conditions), I thought about starting my own business.  And I thought hard ... <br><br>  Points over which I thought and recommend to think other "businessmen": <br>  1. Who will pay? <br>  2. Who will code? <br>  3. And where is back office? <br><br>  Now more.

      <strong>1. Who will pay.</strong> <br>  I have a great idea.  I am very smart and know how to embody it.  But who will buy it.  Therefore, when quitting from a well-paid place and going into all serious private business, you should think - ‚Äúis my product so good that you have a line for it?‚Äù.  You should also think how many products: one is good, but heels are better.  And how many "their customers." <br><br>  ‚ÄúYour client‚Äù is a client, for whom you will work at night, to malnutrition, from which you will receive a penny, which barely pays for working time;  but who will never say bad things, who will write only good things in public and, to which, other clients can be safely directed to receive recommendations.  If there is no such client, it‚Äôs too early to start a business. <br><br>  There must be more than one product (or service) that can be sold.  You can not be sprayed at the start - the company customizing ERP-systems, writing drivers for industrial PCs and typesetting websites can not cause anything but a smile from a decent client.  Because products must be for the same market, but with different specialization.  If the product is one (or just a ‚Äúcool idea‚Äù), it‚Äôs too early to start a business. <br><br>  Well and most importantly - "am I ready to work for the idea?".  Provide yourself with a piece of bread and if not with caviar, so with sausage, on it, any specialist in IT can.  But starting our own business, we are striving for more, and the quality of the sandwich is only a side effect.  Therefore, you should evaluate the ability to pay yourself for your idea - by forces, nerves, time and money.  At the very least, some time will have to pay for food, electricity and the Internet, and at the most - rent, salary and taxes.  If there is no such resource, it‚Äôs too early to start a business. <br><br>  <strong>2. Who will code.</strong> <br>  I am a good programmer.  Not!  I am the best programmer!  And I am a first-class project manager, designer, architect.  And if you still tie a lawnmower from behind, I can mow the grass. <br><br>  It should be understood - there will be no time left for the code or there will be extremely little.  Now the main work is the promotion of its products, negotiations with banks, coordination of contracts with customers, ensuring a sufficient amount of funds in the current account for paying taxes and social benefits, and a lot of what is called administrative work.  If there is no willingness to become an administrator in the broad sense of the word, it is too early to start a business. <br><br>  Encoders should be codified, programmers programmed, design designers should be made.  Our main task is to make all these kind people go towards a common goal.  The task is difficult and ungrateful, because  solving various administrative tasks, you will still have to be a free psychologist from your own staff.  If this is not for you, it‚Äôs too early to start your own business. <br><br>  <strong>3. And where is back office.</strong> <br>  The funny thing is that when working for a company, very few people pay attention to such people as cleaners (cleaning managers), secretaries (call managers), supply managers (office managers).  And these people are very necessary.  It will also require the help of bloodsuckers of the subspecies accountant and lawyer.  In general, if you still do not understand that you will not be engaged in your favorite code, but the devil knows what - it is too early to start your own business. <br><br>  PS If everyone thought in such a depressive way, there would be no small, medium or any other business.  But before you quit, think well - is it too early to start your own business? </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/19364/">https://habr.com/ru/post/19364/</a></p>
