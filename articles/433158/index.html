  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Musical parodies from SUSE about Kubernetes, Linus Torvalds and others</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Last week, colleagues suddenly discovered the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3D0w6kXdHXxAA">music video Kubernetes</a> , which pleasantly surprised with its level.  A brief ‚Äúinvestigation‚Äù revealed that the SUSE Band is behind it - the SUSE music band, which is now part of Micro Focus International and widely known in the Open Source and the IT community in general for its long experience in developing a line of Linux distributions and related products. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/-a/8k/yt/-a8kytfc-txbfeh3zc8cwzsfyci.jpeg"><br><br>  In addition to the quality work and the presence of a decent SUSE Band track record <i>(see below)</i> , the group was impressed: the senior architect plays the drums, SUSE Enterprise sales consultant plays the guitar, and the senior sales engineer plays the bass <i>(yes, no typo in the title of the position)</i> .  For the text of this and other songs are also employees of the company.  What a great move: self-realization of the team in the hobby, and viral marketing, and the joy of the community!  Therefore, this Friday we decided to dilute our technical publications with the presentation of several especially liked SUSE Band clips.  Their lyrics are translated and in some places supplemented with explanatory links. <a name="habracut"></a>
