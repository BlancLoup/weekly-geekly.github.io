  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Road spoon for dinner</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Foodsharing, carsharing, TVsharing, shearing new ideas about sharing - it is obvious that very soon consumption technologies will enter a new cycle, which will determine the structure of business for the next few years.  Humanity wants to consume much more resources than it can buy, and it seems that it has found an alternative way out, as it will be possible to act with ever-increasing needs, in addition to world plunging into the abyss of credit.  From day to day, I personally look forward to the emergence of startups with sharing friends or grandmothers, pets or jobs (for the holiday period). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/9a8/0e4/cdc/9a80e4cdcc00893011754f470c210e8a.jpg" alt="image"><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Everything is logical.  None of us needs a spoon in our hands all the time when we do not eat.  Also, I think, none of us are delighted with the fact that up to 50% of the area of ‚Äã‚Äãeach corridor in each apartment is occupied by things that we don‚Äôt want to put on ourselves right now.  Well, very few people would even think about going after the theater trip to take in the trunk all the favorite actors to their home with the thought: ‚ÄúLet them lie down, maybe tomorrow morning you will want to revise this performance again.‚Äù  A person cannot and is not obliged to become the sole owner of everything that his eyes will see or what his hand can reach - and the widespread sudden awareness of just this fact speaks of a new stage of maturation of all humanity.

The house of the person will cease to be a warehouse of trash and food stocks, and will become a space for rest, creativity and communication. <br><br>  It is possible that certain distribution services \ exchange \ reciprocal services will come to the place of standard stores, where consumers themselves will be ready to create new connections and start the exchange processes of unused equipment.  And the question that concerns me most in this connection is: ‚ÄúIs the weakest link in this chain - is the man himself ready for such a turn of progress?  Today, how many of you and I are ready to not only lease any existing resource in the world, but also reformat your existing business in order to occupy a leading position in tomorrow's market? ‚Äù <br><br>  Willingness is, after all, not so much the availability of material resources for carrying out global changes in business processes and the warehousing system, but rather the courage to restructure in our own and only our own minds.  For example, at almost every conference and symposium on problems and prospects of e-commerce, the idea that the key focus for today's consumers is not at all on the price of a product similar to competitors, but on delivery time and ease and ease of further service.  And the general conclusion that today the quality of delivery in the future gives far greater loyalty than the button rounded off on all guidelines on the website - it is extremely reasonable and promising, yes.  But what happens when people disagree on their jobs after the symposiums, doesn‚Äôt everything remain the same? <br><br>  Analytical capabilities of large sites with ease allow us to predict now: who among us and which new product will be interested in six months or a year at the first appearance of it for sale.  The ability to hold the goods in the hands long before the appearance of a conscious interest or payment - not only the top ten bloggers known throughout the country should be available, but every honest man in the street.  It is the opportunity to take and twist the product - is capable of giving such an explosive growth in sales, which no design expert or UX will ever give.  But how much will we all have to wait for the implementation of this idea in most online stores - 10 years, 15, 25? <br><br>  But the world has never seen such coverage by various means of communication with the possibility of instant execution of transactions.  This is definitely a new experience for all of us, shaking the foundation of the current economic model with the dominance of private property. <br><br>  Yes, and all the future problems of the future sharing epoch are also visible today with the naked eye - distrust of others and the acute sense of ownership raised by previous eras towards unused resources.  And not only to objects - but also to people.  <i>‚ÄúThis is my child, this is my grandmother, this is my ex-husband !!!‚Äù</i> <br><br>  We all still own other people in our thoughts, and the author of this text is no exception - the thought that you own several self-sufficient personalities - warms the soul much more than the possession of even the most sophisticated gadgets.  And this atavism of the past, perhaps, today is the most recent obstacle to progress. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/e58/3b3/421/e583b342117ef4a6adf4700f6be2b4dc.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  But from the growth of sharing startups already nowhere to hide.  How good it is that the most valuable things in the world: the air, the sun, the mother - are given to each of us for free. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/390567/">https://habr.com/ru/post/390567/</a></p>
