It turns out that the tennis table is already in almost every office, and IT companies have to invent more and more extravagant "buns". <br><br>  Some may seem very useful, while others do not always correspond to the real state of affairs.  Today we will analyze the strangest and really necessary bonuses.  And in our <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/1cloud/blog/318430/">digest</a> you can find a few more articles on corporate culture. <br><br> <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/1cloud/blog/318534/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e6c/3c2/d6e/e6c3c2d6e36a3c3d849564e5aee77410.jpg"></a> <br><a name="habracut"></a>  / Pixabay / <a href="https://pixabay.com/ru/%25D0%25B7%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BF%25D1%2583%25D1%2581%25D0%25BA-%25D1%2581%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B5%25D1%2589%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B5-%25D0%25BC%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B7%25D0%25B3%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B9-%25D1%2588%25D1%2582%25D1%2583%25D1%2580%25D0%25BC-594091/">StartupStockPhotos</a> / <a href="https://pixabay.com/ru/service/terms/">CC0</a>

    <h2>  Employee care </h2><br>  Many technical companies make the office not only a place of work, but a multifunctional platform where you can get a wide range of services.  For example, in many companies there is a hairdresser and dry cleaning (for example, in <a href="http://thenextweb.com/insider/2012/04/09/12-startups-that-offer-their-employees-the-coolest-perks/">the</a> Google <a href="http://thenextweb.com/insider/2012/04/09/12-startups-that-offer-their-employees-the-coolest-perks/">office</a> ), their own restaurants (in <a href="http://www.wisebread.com/the-15-coolest-silicon-valley-job-perks-you-wish-you-had">the</a> Facebook <a href="http://www.wisebread.com/the-15-coolest-silicon-valley-job-perks-you-wish-you-had">office</a> ) or the delivery of useful and free food (Spotify).  What about a concierge service (see ‚ÄúThe Facade of the Concierge Service‚Äù <a href="http://blog.synerion.com/are-ping-pong-tables-and-other-office-perks-really-important-for-retention">here</a> ), whose staff will pick up your laundry from your laundry, organize a party, or do any errands while you work? <br><br>  Such services can make life easier with a tight schedule and create a comfortable atmosphere.  And if the employees don‚Äôt have a headache about how to manage to do all the things, including personal ones, they can concentrate on their work. <br><br>  Evernote also cares about employees and wants them not to spend all the weekends doing housework, so they can get free house cleaning twice a month.  But this is not the only company that attracts employees in this way.  If you want to receive regular cleaning in the apartment, we advise you to pay attention to the company Exec. <br><br>  And Google cares about the education of its employees and is willing to pay for any courses.  You can upgrade your skills, attend language schools or even gardening courses.  In addition, if you do not like to adhere to a strict dress code, then almost any company in Silicon Valley will suit you. <br><br><h2>  Health </h2><br>  You have probably heard that many companies equip their own fitness room with additional sections from yoga to martial arts (Yahoo, Mail.Group and <a href="http://www.builtinla.com/2016/06/21/these-companies-will-get-your-office-whipped-shape">others</a> ), and also offer massages and acupuncture.  Such services can serve as an excellent <a href="https://news.tinypulse.com/sk-useless-common-perks-organizational-culture-95082/">prevention</a> (see the Employee wellness program item) of many diseases.  And as you know, in America, and in Europe, treatment is quite expensive.  Therefore, sports can help reduce hospital bills. <br><br>  Other companies find an alternative way to solve the problem of payment for treatment and provide employees with access to the services of a doctor right in the office.  Although not everyone is positive about this, as many diseases are sensitive, and not everyone would like to solve such problems at work. <br><br><h2>  All for parents </h2><br>  Netflix is ‚Äã‚Äãconsidered <a href="http://www.inc.com/zoe-henry/glassdoor-top-companies-employee-benefits.html">an ideal</a> workplace for parents, as it allows moms and dads to go on a long-term parental leave for a whole year.  In other companies, the decree is usually only a few months.  Another advantage is a flexible schedule after leaving such leave, periodic work from home or just the opportunity to take time off.  And Facebook pays 4 thousand dollars to newly-minted parents. <br><br>  Adobe assists employees in adopting children.  This, of course, is not useful to everyone, but still a good socially significant bonus.  Another unusual service (which is, for example, in the company Zillow) will be able to please only nursing mothers - is the delivery of breast milk. <br><br>  And Microsoft <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/companies-with-awesome-perks-payscale-2013-1">offers</a> financial assistance, but to children of employees with autism spectrum disorders.  The company is ready to pay for the therapy, which is quite expensive.  By the way, the corporation also hires people with such disabilities.  (We have already written an article about why Western companies are <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/1cloud/blog/309264/">interested</a> in autistic employees). <br><br>  In addition, IT companies in Silicon Valley have long been concerned with improving the demographic situation and are paying employees for infertility treatment.  But Apple and Facebook have gone even further in caring for workers and now they are also sponsoring egg-freezing <a href="https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/238524">procedures</a> , which in 2016 cost about 10-15 thousand dollars.  And the most unusual operation that can be performed at the expense of the company is a sex change operation (as long as it is ready to <a href="http://www.inc.com/zoe-henry/glassdoor-top-companies-employee-benefits.html">pay for it</a> only in Accenture). <br><br><h2>  Entertainment </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/923/57d/4fc/92357d4fc99d1a8772715bbd4469efaa.jpg"><br>  / Flickr / <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/kurafire/8397330268/">Faruk Ate≈ü</a> / <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/">CC-BY</a> <br><br>  Some companies (for example, the Zynga game development company) provide an opportunity to play the console at work.  But usually there is one <a href="https://modelviewculture.com/pieces/how-perks-can-divide-us">caveat</a> - this can be done only during non-working hours.  Of course, it is sometimes cool to hang out with colleagues and relax after a hard day‚Äôs work, and avid gamers will appreciate this bonus. <br><br>  Others (Twitter, Thrillist, Booze) generally <a href="http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424127887323998604578567883910899540">offer</a> free alcohol at work ‚Äî from beer coolers to full-service bars.  Somewhere it can be used during the working day, somewhere this option is available only once a week, for example, on Friday.  Such a bonus will definitely help to make the morning after a fun party brighter and contribute to a relaxed atmosphere.  The main thing is to keep the atmosphere working. <br><br>  And Asana <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/laurencebradford/2016/07/27/13-tech-companies-that-offer-insanely-cool-perks/">pays for the</a> repair of a workplace for a new employee in the amount of up to 10,000. You can choose any table, chair and computer.  If you want to make everything around you with flowers, you don‚Äôt have to drag them from home either - you can just buy them.  In general, a good initiative, which is also a kind of entertainment, because spending a company‚Äôs money can be fun, and most importantly, you spend it absolutely legally. <br><br><h2>  Relaxation </h2><br>  Of the really useful and working <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/laurencebradford/2016/07/27/13-tech-companies-that-offer-insanely-cool-perks/2/">bonuses</a> for travelers, we can mention the Thrillist company, which always gives employees a vacation on their birthday.  At Airbnb, every employee gets the opportunity to spend $ 2,000 to travel to anywhere in the world.  And Evernote compensates money spent on the road in the amount of up to $ 1,000. <br><br>  Unlimited vacation is another <a href="http://www.ibtimes.com/ridiculous-perks-tech-employees-enjoy-infographic-1545026">trend</a> that extends to tech companies (see ‚ÄúTake all the time you need‚Äù).  Have you dreamed to go to Asia for the winter?  Or live a couple of months in a villa on the ocean?  However, there are some nuances.  Most likely, you can go on such a vacation, only if it does not interfere with your work.  Even with limited vacation, workers rarely have time to spend all their days for this very reason.  In more detail about how such a system is arranged, and other vacation "buns", we wrote <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/1cloud/blog/318316/">here</a> . <br><br>  Another travel bonus <a href="http://www.wisebread.com/the-15-coolest-silicon-valley-job-perks-you-wish-you-had">is</a> Expensify, which organizes annual working trips with colleagues to the sea - Croatia, Vietnam, Thailand, the Philippines ... It is really great to watch new countries, sunbathe and buy.  Of course, this is not quite a good rest, but, you see, it can be much more pleasant to work on the seashore. <br><br><h2>  Social Bonuses </h2><br>  Many companies are more socially oriented, for example, in Salesforce you will be paid a week of work in a <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/laurencebradford/2016/07/27/13-tech-companies-that-offer-insanely-cool-perks/2/">volunteer</a> organization and will give you the opportunity to donate up to $ 1,000 to any fund.  Perhaps someone thought about creating a fund named after himself.  But the company certainly controls where it transfers money, and to help those in need of treatment at the expense of the company is still a good deed. <br><br>  The abundance of various bonuses is understandable, but whether they are always really useful is still a <a href="http://meshworking.com/ping-pong-table-worthless-attracting-millennials/">question</a> .  A ping-pong table and an office fully equipped with Apple technology is, of course, cool.  But can only such ‚Äúbonuses‚Äù attract young, ambitious specialists?  According <a href="http://www.pwc.com/gx/en/issues/talent/future-of-work/millennials-survey.html">to</a> PWC <a href="http://www.pwc.com/gx/en/issues/talent/future-of-work/millennials-survey.html">statistics,</a> 52% of employees value career opportunities much more, 44% - high wages and 35% - free training.  Spotify employees <a href="https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Spotify-work-life-balance-Reviews-EI_IE408251.0,7_KH8,25.htm">confirm</a> that the bonuses provided by the company make the work more comfortable.  But the feeling that you can practice yoga, and even free food, does not compensate for the average salary. <br><br><hr><br>  <b>PS</b> Minute serious.  The other day we talked about the work of our IaaS provider: <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/1cloud/blog/318432/">SLA-agreement</a> and automation of work with <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/1cloud/blog/318286/">DNS-records</a> . <br><br><hr></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/318534/">https://habr.com/ru/post/318534/</a></p>
