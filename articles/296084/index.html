As a consequence of this - an unexpected increase in time. <br>  - there were no clear conditions for the customer, i.e.  There was a standard contract, but, for example, the cost of the edits was stipulated on the fly, some customers had their eyes rounded and had to be done.  As a result, the customer was a king and a god, and some of their payment debts have not been paid until now. <br>  - the desire to save, no, I understand that you need to save, but not on what brings you income, that's why the designers were bad, shitty helpers, etc.  Because of what the customer was not satisfied, and the period of project development is greatly increased. <br>  - orders on complexity and requirements are incompatible with the cost, i.e.  the partner took complex orders for ridiculous money, complaining that the city was small (300,000 inhabitants) and nobody wanted to pay, as a result, payments were delayed with the creation and modifications, the following orders were taken until the previous ones were left unfinished and there was a com promised. <br>  - Well, the result of all this was a huge amount of debt and bad reviews. <br>  Well, there were such problems at the studio ‚ÄúHorns and hoofs‚Äù of two people, which I remembered)) <br>  * py.sy.  I do not know why I wrote it, I just remembered something. </blockquote><blockquote>  To work as a small team is happiness.  When everyone works :) and there is a result. <br><br>  In order to earn, we need orders, in order to have orders, we need reputation, in order to have reputation, we need knowledge and experience, and in order to appear, we need ... orders.  Vicious circle. <br><br>  Before listing, I will write the most important thing - a team of like-minded people, should want to develop and achieve results and create a reputation for themselves. <br><br>  Next tezisno, not in order of priority, but as recalled: <br><br>  0) Need specialization for each and the team (I write as it seems, taking into account the size of your team). <br>  * Team Leader or Senior Developer.  He will set quality standards and control work.  Will be responsible for the architecture. <br>  * developer coder <br>  * developer admin <br>  * developer base <br>  * A manager and if there are not enough people, he is also a salesman.  Must know all the CMS that you will apply.  So that he could smoothly show the client how to create a publication, edit, and so on. <br><br>  1) 80% of the time to work on commercial projects and 20% of the time to work on your project.  For advanced training at least.  And if he shoots, then soon there will be no need to work with clients at all :) When there are no orders, everyone is working on ‚Äútheir‚Äù project, raising their skills, applying and testing new technologies or new workloads.  If you competently come up with a task for yourself, then the process of working on it and the results can be used to promote your team.  Suppose you took up the development of the module of the exchange of data of the accounting store.  See what solutions are already on the market for your CMS.  Make it more convenient and better or faster or stupidly better documented solution.  This will allow you to get into the "store" modules for CMS and will give you new customers.  When you have a narrow and high-quality solution, it will be easier for your sales person to talk to the client and get into already existing IT infrastructures.  To alter the online store, no one will give you one, but they can replace the module with yours. <br><br>  2) Production technology.  Especially if several people work.  You should have common standards and technologies for writing, documenting, working with code changes, your own ‚Äúlibrary‚Äù of solutions that you could use as often as possible.  Create your checklists for the production stages and, if possible, automate routine operations. <br><br>  3) If we are talking about web development, then most likely you will need to know perfectly up to three of the most popular CMS.  It is advisable to get a certificate / status. <br><br>  4) Standards for working with client projects are needed.  TZ, documentation, customer training, and so on.  To minimize labor costs or at least to minimize unpaid labor costs. <br><br>  5) To know English at the level of reading documentation at least. <br><br>  6) and ... slowly add new directions.  To move away from a pure web to a web + mob, or from ‚Äúsites‚Äù to a complex e-commerce.  Ideally, when the client is less and the income is greater.  This requires deep knowledge in a relatively narrow direction and two or three serious clients.  Do not try to sculpt a lot of cheap sites. <br><br>  In short.  The peculiarity and advantage of small teams is that on the one hand they are forced to concentrate several roles or areas of knowledge in one person, but on the other hand, this will ensure faster work on the project.  True, it is good when you are not just a team, but a TEAM. <br><br>  This is so tezisno. </blockquote><br><br> <a href="https://toster.ru/tag/%25D1%2583%25D0%25BF%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B2%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B5%2520%25D0%25BF%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BA%25D1%2582%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B8/interest_questions"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d02/6d0/4db/d026d04db390469987ce2fff7ab8581a.png" align="right"></a> <h4>  Section <a href="https://toster.ru/tag/%25D1%2583%25D0%25BF%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B2%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B5%2520%25D0%25BF%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BA%25D1%2582%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B8/interest_questions">"Project Management"</a> </h4><br>  Interest Ask: <br><br>  - ‚ÄúWhat is agile development?‚Äù <br><br>  <i>As far as I understand, this is an approach to creating a product, when tasks and TK can change in real time?</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Is it so?</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>Thanks in advance for the detailed answer!</i> <blockquote>  Development methodology. <br><br>  Waterfall: we carefully plan everything, set deadlines, develop, rent out. <br><br>  Agile: Approximately we plan, analyze, set a deadline, plan for the current iteration, develop, plan for the current iteration, develop ..., hand over <br><br>  Waterfall issues: <br>  If someone has debated, everyone is waiting.  If you need to add something, it is very difficult, because the planning phase was very long and thorough, and something to change means you have to change everything. <br>  If the plan states that we do it first, and then something, it may happen that some people who will do ‚Äúsomething‚Äù will be kicked for a while by ‚Äúcucumbers‚Äù while waiting for the first people to do ‚Äúthis‚Äù. <br>  Pros Waterfall: <br>  Everything is planned, everyone knows exactly when they will do it. <br><br>  Agile problems: <br>  People must be mature enough to properly load themselves with work ‚Äî Agile in a bureaucratic environment will simply fail. <br><br>  Pros Agile: <br>  There is practically no downtime for anyone - everyone can always get busy with tasks. <br>  In the case of new requirements, they can without any harm to enter into the project at almost any stage.  The main thing is to be technically possible (in the case of waterfall, the problem is precisely at the level of statements and plan, that is, bureaucracy) <br>  Adequate use of labor - if someone does not have current tasks, it can officially be taken for other projects. <br><br>  Agile is not a superface, it is a tool, or rather an approach to planning work, but they need to know how to use it. </blockquote><blockquote>  Agile is an approach for developing startups.  Initially released from XP and Lean Startup.  His main goal - to settle somewhere in the direction of the world when everything around is incomprehensible.  Waterfall is a methodology in which you see the path entirely to the desired goal. <br><br>  It is a mistake to assume that waterfall is too cumbersome and it doesn‚Äôt allow doing there as Agile-type sprints or the like, which was actually invented in waterfall and was called iteration and generally came from another method - Iterative development. <br><br>  Agile is more a business method than a methodology.  Well suited where the client does not know how to achieve the goal and the team also does not really understand this, but he knows where to start and knows how to do some work. <br><br>  From the point of view of the PM, your choice is always Waterfall, otherwise you do not control the resources, terms, quality that cannot be achieved with Agile.  There you have either a fixed budget, or a time frame, and one thing drives you to another. <br><br>  I use a cheat sheet for myself: <br>  1. We and the client understand how to make the product and you can make a plan and TK - Waterfall <br>  2. It is not clear to us or the client how to make a product and make a plan and TK - Agile <br><br>  There are first and second projects, that's all. </blockquote><br><br> <a href="https://toster.ru/tag/%25D1%2581%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B8%25D1%2581%25D1%258B/interest_questions"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/be2/60f/f45/be260ff458684e2e99275b433c31ced2.png" align="right"></a> <h4>  <a href="https://toster.ru/tag/%25D1%2581%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B8%25D1%2581%25D1%258B/interest_questions">Services</a> Section </h4><br>  Interest Ask: <br><br>  - <a href="https://toster.ru/q/263470">‚ÄúWhat services allow you to receive a one-time SMS for registration?‚Äù</a> <br>  <i>Greetings friends!</i>  <i>There was a question about registration in the social.</i>  <i>networks, you need to register a lot of accounts.</i>  <i>What service can I use to receive disposable SMS?</i>  <i>Preferably a service that can be replenished with kiwi.</i>  <i>I used to use sms-reg, but lately it does not suit me.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Thanks in advance for your reply.</i> <blockquote>  I do not know about qiwi, but in all projects I use <a href="https://www.twilio.com/">www.twilio.com</a> </blockquote><blockquote>  You can also look at this: sms-area.org </blockquote><br><br> <a href="https://toster.ru/tag/%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B8%25D1%2582%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B0/interest_questions"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/6d6/3d4/c1f/6d63d4c1fc704e9086ac579cbf2df7af.png" align="right"></a> <h4>  Section <a href="https://toster.ru/tag/%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B8%25D1%2582%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B0/interest_questions">"Analytics"</a> </h4><br>  Interest Ask: <br><br>  - <a href="https://toster.ru/q/262766">‚ÄúFree consulting for projects.</a>  <a href="https://toster.ru/q/262766">Do I need him?</a> <br><br>  <i>It is not a secret for anyone that at the early stage of development of any project, there appear a lot of various obstacles.</i>  <i>Whether it is poorly defined CA or not an effective model of promotion, and maybe the whole project.</i>  <i>Such closures are the norm for "beginner start-ups".</i> <i><br></i>  <i>And here we are with colleagues, we decided to take up a small altruistic matter - to conduct an express analysis of projects on a grant basis.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>All this as an elective.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>The team got a good one, all experts in their fields.</i>  <i>Everyone has clear boundaries for which we try not to overstep.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>So the question.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>In your opinion, is it worth developing this direction?</i>  <i>Is it worth sharing your knowledge and experience for free?</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>Many thanks to all who speak out.</i>  <i>Thank!</i> <blockquote>  At a certain stage of development, it is important for a startup to hear from outside.
