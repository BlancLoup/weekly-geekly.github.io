It is practically a miniature planet - rivers, mountains, lakes.  The order of things was followed by a computer calling itself Noah.  He was on his mind, and talked only with one person on this planet.  The communication took place in a strange language - C ++, although he spoke quite well in Russian.  Noah could do anything with this microworld, including rain and earthquakes, if there was a corresponding code ... </blockquote>

      John woke up in a cold sweat, what a week he had nightmares in which Noah destroys all the inhabitants of the Ark, and all this because of the few lines of comments found in Noah‚Äôs source code: <br><br> <code>/** <br> *      ,       . <br> *     ,      <br> * <br> * @author DevLead 2058/03/26 <br> */ <br></code> <br><br>  John was already beginning to curse the day when he began to study C ++, because then he dreamed about how with Noah they could improve this world.  He wanted to be ‚Äúchosen‚Äù ‚Äîthat was the name of the one whom Noah admitted to himself.  And so, now, immersed in the source code of Noah, John seriously thought about what was happening around, and about his role in this world ... <br><br>  He was ‚Äúelected‚Äù six years ago, it was an honor, his parents were proud of him, their peers were jealous.  At that time, he had everything he could wish for himself - his own house, his scooter, and the work that he liked.  He was self-confident, he was confident in his knowledge, and he was going to change this world - of course with the help of Noah, but this did not cloud dreams. <br><br>  The smell of freshly brewed coffee woke up the sobriety of the mind, drove away the memories, and the burden of responsibility for the outside world, for people who believe in the "chosen" and in Noah, was fully felt.  This load was not an unbearable burden for John, he was preparing for this, he wanted this, he knew that only he could cope with it ... <br><br>  ‚ÄúCoffee, still warm bread with melted butter, is such an ordinary morning, and such unusual thoughts‚Äù <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/64f/068/8c5/64f0688c57b49bec9670bf64378c04dd.jpg" title="coffee" width="460" height="363"><br><br>  John had almost sentenced his breakfast when his little son approached him, and pointing to an old book with his finger, said: <br>  - Dad, what is a rainbow? <br>  - You'll see soon, Dad will show you in a week.  And now I have to go to work, John said, trying to look at his biometric pass.  Pass, windbreaker, helmet, scooter - almost automatically, but without gravity in the shower. <br><br>  ‚ÄúOn the way to work, John‚Äôs imagination clearly painted a picture of a not so terrible future ...‚Äù <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/531/58e/d1a/53158ed1a50e99b658b71b68f8c7e718.jpg" title="rainbow" width="460" height="349"><br><br><hr><br><br>  More than a thousand years have passed since the FH (Human Foolishness) day, the Ark continued to surf the space, generations of programmers develop world improvements, but no one will ever allow Noah to become self-sufficient. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/115296/">https://habr.com/ru/post/115296/</a></p>
