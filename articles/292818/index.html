And here everything goes, from testing the headers, to playing with the color of the buttons in the basket, and sometimes it takes too much time to figure out what specifically leads to an increase in the number of customers.  But, over time, a solution is found for each problem, services have appeared that offer a guaranteed increase in the percentage of conversions due to widgets and for a very modest fee.  According to the conversion growth tools, huge statistics are collected, and when choosing, you do not need to do exhausting testing, you already know that they will bring you income.  Let's compare two services, with a different approach to using widgets to increase conversion, this comparative analysis will be sufficient, as in general, services for providing widgets can be classified into two types precisely on the basis of this approach. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/5ef/a36/df9/5efa36df93563b72dcc86097462d5f83.png" alt="image"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  We define the meaning of the concept of "conversion".  <i>Conversion is the execution of a target action by a visitor to your site, in other words, a conversion is when a potential customer visiting your site does what you need.</i>  <i>Conversion rate - this is how many customers out of a hundred who come have met your expectations.</i>

      Obviously, the more conversions, the better, the question is, how to achieve this growth.  It is clear that nobody canceled the a / b method of testing, but I would like to quickly and surely grow real customers from potential.  And then who is ready for anything, and if the shaman tambourine helped, then I think we would often watch the owners of sites performing dances around the performance indicators of their site.  Fortunately, the Internet technologies are developing with cosmic speed, and the ‚Äútrial and error method‚Äù is replacing clear analytically verified strategies.  And instead of looking for conspiracies and sales prayers, it is wise to use the experience of those who have already come to real and effective methods of increasing the number of conversions. <br><br>  More than once and not in one article, it was written about the benefits of various widgets (a widget is a small independent software module that works in some environment (for example, website, browser, mobile phone) and performs, as a rule, one particular function; web widget - This is a piece of code that can be embedded by the user into any HTML page and used without significant modification. Typically, when creating web widgets, technologies are used (DHTML, JavaScript and Adobe Flash) to increase conversions.  There are interactive widgets that react to user behavior, there are static ones.  Widgets can be classified indefinitely, and in this diversity, the site owner is again at a dead end: ‚ÄúWhich one to choose?  Use all at once?  Will it not be worse? ‚Äù <br><br>  And this problem, has found its solution - there are services that not only offer a catalog of widgets, their installation and maintenance, but also explain why they are, what thanks to them change and in what percentage.  It goes without saying that demand creates supply, and now, on the Russian market, not one, but several services offering conversion growth options due to various kinds of widgets.  And entrepreneurs, another difficulty in choosing a service.  Having analyzed this problem, competitors with a completely different approach to obtaining conversion through widgets, we will try to figure it out. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/964/dfa/4bc/964dfa4bce931aabfcb4a4cb3bf9bd39.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Recall that the services offering widgets, a great many.  And the choice of these services is due to a different approach to obtaining conversion through widgets.  <a href="http://xn--allbackhunter-o8k.com/">Callbackhunter.com</a> is a mastodon in the widget market, purposefully developing its unique widget for an aggressive sales model, and having achieved excellent results in this business.  <a href="http://sharkup.ru/">Sharkup.ru</a> is a young dynamically developing service, seeking to solve all the problems of a client with its widgets, to extract any possibility of receiving a conversion.  A superficial study of the comparative table may seem that the ideal option is sharkup.ru.  And cheap, and widgets from 5 and more, it would seem, why understand further, here it is our ideal option.  But, let's try to dig deeper, because not for nothing callbackhunter.com has been in the market for so many years, and it is constantly gaining more and more popularity. <br><br><h4>  Callbackhunter.com and Target Audience </h4><br>  Upon closer inspection, it can be seen that this product works with a large amount of data, tracks behavioral sequences, based on intellectual analysis, helps to grab those customers who are ready for conversion, but still have some doubts.  This is a definite plus of this widget, it makes it easier for you to work with analytics, it allows you to approach each client individually.  Those who are ready to buy will not be distracted by this widget, those who accidentally went to the site will not be worried, those who are ready to buy, but they doubt that an additional chance will be given to make a purchase. <br>  In addition to the pop-up window, with the proposal to leave the phone, in conjunction with it works, the icon, call, incredibly annoying customers, not only is it located in the most inconvenient place, but also so aggressive that it seems that you do not want to help solve your problem, but they want to "smelt" something that you do not need at all.  Due to such an aggressive sales policy, it is necessary to carefully adjust this widget.  Carefully approach the analysis of the pages on which this widget should be placed. <br><br>  <b>Who needs it:</b> if you have a large online resource or online store, then this is what you need.  While your analysts are drowning in the ocean of data, this service will help you not to lose potential customers.  But!  It should be remembered that this widget should be placed after a thorough analysis of customer behavior on the site, and exactly where the maximum number of customers is lost (whether it‚Äôs the order form page, the shopping cart, the page with search results for the site, the pages with products that are not available etc.).  Here, again, you should not abandon testing, perhaps somewhere the ill-fated button will scare off customers, increasing the percentage of failures, and possibly if difficulties arise, on the contrary, will be perceived as caring for the customer. <br><br>  <b>But should one refuse</b> : if you sell a product of your own, through the capture pages (one-page pages), then the behavioral factors that can be tracked and noticed at least, such a widget is akin to a tank in a city, movement is possible, but expensive and meaningless.  Since multi-step behavioral sequences of actions on one-page pages are not possible in principle, this widget will be too aggressive, so you should abandon it in favor of less aggressive, but no less effective widgets.  On the other hand, if you need the maximum amount of sales, the flow of traffic to the site is quite high, then you can not be afraid of the percentage of failures due to the annoying call button. <br>  The service requires the most fine-tuning: if you sell real estate, cars, travel vouchers, in general, everything that usually requires multi-level conversions (this is when a client visits your site more than once or twice before making a purchase), choosing this widget , will oblige you to monitor the client's behavior each time you visit the site and configure the widget so that it appears at the very visit in which ordering a call is appropriate.  Otherwise, you either push the client away, or the service will not notice the client at all.  Plus, the annoying call button when repeatedly entering the site will not only annoy, but will cause aggression and repel the purchase.  In other words, perhaps you should abandon this widget, in favor of the less aggressive ones, which do not force, but gently push the client to purchase. <br><br><h4>  Sharkup.ru and target audience </h4><br>  This service is young and contains in its arsenal a fairly large list of widgets executed in the original design, which allow not only to keep leaving customers, but also provide interaction with social services.  networks, collecting subscribers, watching videos, holding stocks, etc.  Flexible customization of widgets, one of the significant advantages of the service: you can customize the views depending on the time of day, days of the week and customer behavior. <br>  Based on the comparative characteristics of prices, the above conclusions, this service is ideal, register, buy, install - and here it is, the endless avalanche of customers.  I would like to believe in it, but let's turn on the logic.  If in the first variant there is no question of choice, the only option is, the only question is in the choice of tariff, then, in the vast space of options, the question arises which set is right for you.  Of course, the developers of this service are working to inform clients as much as possible about the possible increase in conversions, while using these or other widgets, consultations are underway, real statistics are collected.  There are widgets that are guaranteed to bring you customers, and there are those that in any case will have to be tested.  This is the disadvantage of this service - little information.  Of course, the widgets are selected with the condition that each of them will increase the conversion of your site, since they were created for this purpose only, but unlike intellectual analysis and the first service associated with it, in this case analytics, experiments and behavioral assessment Factors do not give up. <br><br>  <b>Who needs it:</b> if you have a one-page website, or a website with a very simple structure, you should use this service.  Since these widgets, at no additional cost to the programmer, will help you significantly increase sales.  Therefore, for small businesses, with a limited budget and number of employees, this is the most effective option. <br><br>  <b>Who should think:</b> entrepreneurs promoting expensive products and services, those that require multi-stage conversions.  The fact that widgets are worth using is undeniable, the question is in accurate testing.  The introduction of widgets for this kind of services, the process is not one day.  Therefore, this issue should be approached with great care, to consult with the developers, to ensure continuous monitoring of the site, and the analysis obtained through monitoring data.  The undoubted advantage of this service, and the kaleidoscope of widgets, is that they are less aggressive, and, consequently, the probability of scaring off a client, by means of pressure on him with widgets, is rather low.  But the likelihood that the client will keep in his social.  Networks have liked the proposal and will return to the site again, great. <br>  Is it worth refusing ?: if you are the owner of a large online store, and every day your analysts work with a huge amount of data, then the first service is an ideal option for you, as it will make life easier for your employees.  But, most likely, for soft and non-obtrusive pressure on the client, you will need other options for widgets.  Consequently, the second service is also useful to you. <br><br><h4>  Comparison of services in terms of ease of use. </h4><br><ul><li>  Easy to set up: The difficulty in setting up Callbackhunter.com is in finding behavioral sequences, after which the call order window should be displayed, you can certainly rebuild the widget by the time you spend on the site, but will it be as effective as you would like ?!  The undoubted advantage is that in any case a manager will be attached to you to help you cope with the program code and the widget settings.  In any case, you yourself can manage the setup or the setup manager widget will set up for you, once it is high-quality, it will bring you new customers and with them the income growth.  Sharkup.ru is an absolutely user-friendly interface.  Dealing with it is not difficult, and this is for the small business an obvious, fat plus.  In addition to the fact that the widgets of this service are easy to set up, the service itself leaves a lot of advice from marketers, both for choosing and setting up widgets, and if you still have difficulties, you can always use the help of Sharkup.ru experts online.  We add that there are many widgets in the second service, the complex configuration of each of them would lead to the loss of a large amount of time.  Therefore, for a business with multistage conversions, sites, with a large number of tests and experiments, the second service is most beneficial, since it significantly saves time and money, and also, due to its flexibility, allows you to test the effect of various widgets on the conversion of the site. </li><li>  Setup Instructions: Callbackhunter.com has a detailed step-by-step instruction and the widget assigned to the client, that is, regardless of the level of competence in working with sites, the widget will be configured as it should.  Sharkup.ru - in this service, the manual is less detailed, although it is provided with pictures with step-by-step tuning, this can be justified by the low level of complexity and obviousness of settings, but still, I would like more details. </li><li>  Operation: when charging for Callbackhunter.com, it is difficult to understand how they calculate the payment, whether by the number of conversions, or by the time of the call, how they monitor it, how they stop it.  At this price level, this is not good, because, nevertheless, I would like to find out on the bank what exactly such amounts are paid for.  Sharkup.ru - pleases with the transparency of payment: paid, use, everything is simple and transparent, it inspires confidence.  Plus, the price for using the service is much lower than Callbackhunter.com. </li><li>  Service package: Callbackhunter.com along with selling your own widget, a service for communicating with a client, if your sales team is provided with a service for communicating (dialing and calling back when ordering a call) with a client, then you don‚Äôt need this function especially her impossible.  Sharkup.ru - you choose everything you need.  No one additional services to you, which can not be refused in the general account will not enter. </li></ul><br><br>  In conclusion, I would like to note, no matter what service you choose, in any case, it will bring you profit and customers.  And maybe you should not dwell on one service, but use them in tandem.  Using Sharkup.ru to interact with the social.  networks, holding promotions, leaving reviews, etc., and Callbackhunter.com for ordering calls and customer feedback. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/292818/">https://habr.com/ru/post/292818/</a></p>
