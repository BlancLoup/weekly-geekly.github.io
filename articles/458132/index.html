But, this idea is not shared by all those citizens who are really confronted with a problem / environmental catastrophe.  Moreover, what else can one expect ‚Äúpositive‚Äù from the state portal agency / contractor with such an initiative that carelessly treats personal data of those distressed citizens who filled out questionnaires with the ego of the eastern suburbs of the eastern region and not only. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  Initiative of the Accounting Chamber.  The essence </h4><br><blockquote>  ‚ÄúIn 2019, Russia launched the national project‚Äú Ecology ‚Äù, within which it is planned to solve a whole range of tasks: reducing air pollution, cleansing water bodies, eliminating landfills and creating a new system of solid municipal waste management.  The Accounts Chamber monitors the implementation of national projects, one of the tasks of which is to identify problems at the initial stage, when it is possible to correct the shortcomings made in planning.  The national project is aimed at improving the lives of citizens, so it is public opinion about the successes and difficulties that arise that plays an important role in evaluating performance.  We want your opinion to be heard, so we offer to answer a few questions. ‚Äù <br>  <a href="https://portal.audit.gov.ru/">A source.</a> </blockquote><br>  After filling in the proposed questionnaire, without using any SQL / Web injections, the results of the survey become available, and the most recent question / answer opens the names / mails / phone numbers of citizens who filled in the answer to No. 14: ‚Äú <b>Leave your contact information for communication in case of necessity</b> . " <br><br>  The project started recently: on June 24, and for today, a rainy evening, more than 130 pages are available with personal data for everyone to show, and this is a holiday for all those who collect similar databases goremyk.

      What to do with such a database - each script kiddie can show his imagination, and it will not be difficult to implement and implement it.  You can even try to figure out the personalities of those activists who ‚Äúdashed off‚Äù on their own superiors, who at night in a white T-shirt with the inscription ‚ÄúI am for clean air‚Äù gives the command ‚Äúgas!‚Äù In a sleepy voice on the phone. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/69/vo/z0/69voz05fihwcoljaxxgoevhfady.png"><br><br>  It is also possible to observe from the results of the proposed survey that one of the main environmental problems in the Russian Federation is the garbage / garbage reform. <br><br><h3>  Part 2  MSW Timokhovo </h3><br>  Once there was a moment to tell the whole country through Habr what actually happens in the Noginsk district of the Bogorodsky urban district with ecology, I inform you that the ecological situation <s>is</s> critical and <s>tense</s> . <br><br>  MSW Timokhovo - one of the largest operating landfills in Europe, which <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/">is located</a> NE.  5 km from the town of Elektrougli and 8 km of the city of Z. Elektrostali <i>(as well as, closed by the index finger of the President of the Russian Federation, ‚Äú <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/">Kuchino dump</a> ‚Äù),</i> on critical days, residents of several cities are poisoned at <u>night by</u> landfill gas <i>dead on time</i> <s>strictly schedule</s> .  The scale of emissions of cubic meters of hydrogen sulphide / methane / ... into the air is so huge that the ‚Äúhaze‚Äù envelops, for example, the city of Elektrougli and its immediate surroundings.  If the <s>stalkers of the</s> residents of the city of Elektrougli are lucky with the wind rose, then the night of sorrow will fall on the residents of the city of Elektrostal or the east of Gel Dor.  Such an established environmental catastrophe in the east of the Moscow region is observed in the last 4 years.  At the same time, landfills arose long before my DR, and woke up like gas volcanoes several years ago, when they began to introduce degassing on solid waste. <br><br>  <a href="http://xn----dtbbtcolffdeabb6cxc.xn--p1ai/index.php/razmeshchenie-otkhodov">Information</a> from the official site Timokhovo <br><blockquote>  ‚ÄúLandfill‚Äú Timokhovo ‚Äùfully meets environmental and sanitary requirements for waste disposal and recycling facilities. <br><br>  The second stage of the cleaned-up was put into operation <i>(the author's note - probably, the scavengers had in mind "cleaning"</i> facilities <i>)</i> that cleanse the filtrate almost to the state of drinking water.  The total capacity is 600 m3 / day; <br>  The cleaning efficiency is over 98%. ‚Äù </blockquote>  The appropriate authorities should react to such false statements and they react - they show that the air is normal, measurements are made once every two weeks - in the afternoon.  And Timokhovo engineers of MSW report at public hearings that they have taken measurements, and further than the extreme points of the landfill the emissions of harmful substances do not spread.  Yes, the people of such techies are booing, demanding to recognize the measurement reports as invalid (even the officials doubted such a report at one of the meetings), asks the authorities to establish an air quality monitoring station within the city, but the scavengers are strong, it's hard to go against the ‚Äúmafia‚Äù and go on a deadly despair <i>(later, I will find, I will lay out a video from such a round table, where activists ‚Äúraise officials and garbage workers with solid waste‚Äù on the forks).</i> <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Responses of citizens suffocating from landfill gas of the activities of the Timokhovo landfill, taken mainly in recent months from various resources.</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><blockquote> Tatyana Sh. <br>  It stinks terribly.
