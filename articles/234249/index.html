  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Two DataPro Specialists Receive Accredited Tier Specialist Certificates</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Two DataPro representatives, Technical Director Vladimir Skorobogatov and Production Director Vladimir Muravyov, successfully completed training at the Uptime Institute (UI) and received Accredited Tier Specialist certificates. <br><br>  The content of the course, in which Uptime specialists were trained, included two standards: ‚ÄúTopology‚Äù (Topology) and ‚ÄúOperational Sustainability‚Äù (Operational Sustainability).  The course teaches the correct application of these standards and helps to avoid mistakes when building a data center and its further operation.  First of all, the UI course is designed for operations managers and those responsible for the construction of the data center. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The course in classic English was delivered by Alfonso Aranda, the current consultant of the Uptime Institute.  The duration of training was two days, and included 5 sessions of 1.5 hours each each day.  In the classroom practiced practical tasks for the course.  On the third day, an examination control of knowledge in the form of tests was conducted.  Individual tickets included 50 questions, for each of which 4 possible answers were provided.  For the exam required the correct answers to 35 questions, which is about 70% of the correct answers. <br><br>  As a result of training, DataPro specialists got the opportunity to learn how to correctly apply the UI standards, as well as to get acquainted with the best international practices in order to further use the knowledge gained in their work.

      ‚ÄúThe training was superbly organized,‚Äù says Vladimir Muravyov, Production Director at DataPro.  Questions could be asked during lectures and during breaks.  The lecturer was competent enough, friendly and communication problems were not created.  Many questions were asked from the floor.  The lecturer tried to answer all the questions in detail.  Simultaneous translation was carried out by a specialist who perfectly mastered the material, due to which the language barrier did not arise. ‚Äù <br><br>  DataPro companies needed such training, since at present the process of organizing the operation service is under way, regulations and instructions are being improved, and personnel are being trained.  In addition, both technology sites will in the future undergo a process of certification of operational sustainability for compliance with Tier Standard Operational Sustainability. <br><br>  Data centers are a field of activity that needs high-level professionals with deep knowledge and extensive practical work experience.  UI courses are one of the sources of advanced knowledge and successful practical experience.  At the same time, the standard Accredited Tier Specialist, strictly speaking, is advisory in nature and is not a strict requirement. <br><br>  Worldwide, the number of professionals who have received the Accredited Tier Specialist certificate does not exceed 750 people.  Of these, no more than 40 people in Russia have such a certificate. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/234249/">https://habr.com/ru/post/234249/</a></p>
