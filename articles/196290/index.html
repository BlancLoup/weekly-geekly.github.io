On the recommendations of the brainstorm - at the first stage - we just throw in ideas, <b>without any criticism</b> . <br>  Just ideas, even the craziest. <br>  For example, casting seals into orbit.  (Initially, the article was called: “Inertia of thinking: how to create a market for space cargo transportation of 6 million tons per year”) <br>  But this is just an example of the inertia of thinking, dry, logical and ... sad. <br><br>  <b>What ideas already exist</b> When answering the question “How can we satisfy the demand for space cargo in the amount of 6 million tons per year?” <br>  1) Launch of nuclear waste (about 50,000,000 tons, it is necessary to clarify) <br>  2) <a href="http://www.apic.ru/marketing/prom_holod/">Market "cold</a> ." <br>  3) The idea of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keith_Lofstrom">Keith Lofstrom’s developer</a> Sky Sky Server Sky orbital data center, an orbital data center of 7 gram satellites as thick as a solar-powered paper sheet ( <a href="http://www.ustream.tv/recorded/1431656">video</a> ) <br>  4) <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/195696/">3D printing in solar orbit</a> <br>  5) tourism, colonization of Mars, the Moon, <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/194616/">Europe</a> <br>  6) private satellites, private navigation systems, private communications <br>  7) Mining (from the <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/195538/">moon</a> , <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DGIAuQp1dW-4">satellites of Jupiter</a> , <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/191270/">asteroids</a> ) <br><br>  I would very much like to hear your ideas / projects (or links to such projects) that complement this list or deepen it, concretize it. <br>  Examples from literature / science fiction are also welcome. <br><br>  I clearly understand that there will be a lot of trolling, but in the midst of it there are crumbs of something worthwhile. <br><br><h5>  First, a little theory: </h5><br>  <i>“I will no longer work for the present, I work for the future” N. Tesla</i> <br><br>  <b>Foresight</b> (from the English. Foresight - looking into the future, foresight) is a tool for shaping priorities and mobilizing a large number of participants to achieve qualitatively new results in the fields of science and technology, the economy, the state and society.  According to the results of foresight projects, road maps are created.  It is one of the most important tools of the innovation economy. <br>  "Foresight is a systematic attempt to assess the long-term prospects of science, technology, economics and society, in order to determine strategic research directions and new technologies that can bring the greatest social and economic benefits."  Ben Martin (SPRU, University of Sussex) ( <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A4%25D0%25BE%25D1%2580%25D1%2581%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B9%25D1%2582">Wikipedia</a> ) <br><br>  <b>Brainstorming</b> , brainstorming (brainstorming, brainstorming, English brainstorming) is an operational method of solving problems based on stimulating creative activity, in which participants in the discussion are asked to express as many solutions as possible, including the most fantastic ones.  Then, from the total number of ideas expressed, the most successful ones are selected that can be used in practice.  ( <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259C%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B7%25D0%25B3%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B9_%25D1%2588%25D1%2582%25D1%2583%25D1%2580%25D0%25BC">Wikipedia</a> ) <br><br>  <b>Inertia of thinking</b> (psychological inertia) is the opposite of fantasy, imagination.  It consists in the closure of thinking on the existing system, unwillingness to get away from current ideas and beliefs. <br>  Inertia of thinking is useful and necessary in everyday life.  It frees you from having to decide what has already been decided. <br>  At the same time, this is the main obstacle to discovering new things. <br>  Often the inertia of thinking is characteristic not so much for people far from discoveries, but rather for those who make these discoveries. <br>  Today, in order for the inventor to escape from the inertia of thinking, several methods have been developed.  Their basis is the use of abstraction, an attempt to escape from the "captivity of words."  ( <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2598%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580%25D1%2586%25D0%25B8%25D1%258F_%25D0%25BC%25D1%258B%25D1%2588%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D1%258F">Wikipedia</a> ) <br><br>  You can use any method of overcoming the inertia of thinking: <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A2%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BE%25D1%2580%25D0%25B8%25D1%258F_%25D1%2580%25D0%25B5%25D1%2588%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D1%258F_%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B7%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B1%25D1%2580%25D0%25B5%25D1%2582%25D0%25B0%25D1%2582%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BB%25D1%258C%25D1%2581%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B8%25D1%2585_%25D0%25B7%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B0%25D1%2587">TRIZ</a> , <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2591%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BE,_%25D0%25AD%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B0%25D1%2580%25D0%25B4_%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B5">de Bono's</a> “hats”, <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A1%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BA%25D1%2582%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B0">synectics</a> , <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259C%25D0%25B5%25D1%2582%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B4_%25D0%25A3%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BB%25D1%2582%25D0%25B0_%25D0%2594%25D0%25B8%25D1%2581%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B5%25D1%258F">Disney strategy</a> , <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2594%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580%25D0%25B3%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD%25D1%2582%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B5_%25D0%25BC%25D1%258B%25D1%2588%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B5">divergent thinking</a> , <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25AD%25D0%25B2%25D1%2580%25D0%25B8%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B0">heuristics</a> , invent your own technique or do without it. <br><br>  Examples of narrow thinking of experts <br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Brilliant misconceptions in science and technology</b> <div class="spoiler_text"> The concept is interesting and well framed.

(Sir John Eric Eriksen - British doctor appointed by the chief surgeon of Queen Victoria, 1873) <br><br>  A device called “telephone” has too many flaws to seriously talk about it as a means of communication.  This device is of no value to us.  (official letter of the employee of Western Union, 1876) <br><br>  Americans may need a phone, but we don’t.  We have enough messenger boys.

(Partners of the Davclass Sarnoff Association in response to his proposal to invest in a radio project, 1920) <br><br>  Professor Godard does not understand the relationship between action and reaction, he does not know that the reaction requires more suitable conditions than a vacuum.  It seems that the professor is experiencing an acute shortage of elementary knowledge, which is taught in high school.

(a question on the discussion of the creation of a microchip in the Advanced Computing Systems Division of IBM, 1968) <br><br>  In 1951, I visited Professor Douglas Hartree, who created the first differential analyzer in England.  He had more experience working with such highly specialized computers than anyone.  He told me that, in his opinion, all the calculations that will be needed here in England can be made on three digital computers that were already being built at that time — one at Cambridge, the second at Teddingding and a third at Manchester.  As he said, personal machines will never be needed by anyone, and the price they have is exorbitant.  (Lord Bowden, American Scientist, 1970) <br><br>  In the mid-70s someone approached me with one idea, which now, probably, can be called a personal computer.  The idea was that we should use an 8080 processor with a keyboard and monitor, and then sell these machines in the domestic market.  I then asked: “What is all this for?” The only thing I heard in response was the creation of a kitchen computer for housewives, which would keep in memory all sorts of culinary recipes.  Personally, I did not see anything useful in this, so we never returned to this idea.  (Gordon Moore, Intel) <br><br>  This computer, by the way, was called Honeywell Kitchen Computer and cost about 4 brand-new cars at the time of release in the USA - no wonder that no one bought anything. <br><br>  No one may need to have a computer in their home.

(Bill Gates in the introduction to OS / 2 User Guide, 1987) <br><br>  Many say that in 1996 the already fast pace of the spread of access to the Network throughout the world will only accelerate.  But personally my opinion is this: the rise of the popularity of the Internet in 1996 will end in complete collapse.

(Sir Alan Sugar, CEO of Amstrad, Daily Telegraph, February 2005) <br><br>  The iPhone has no chance of getting a significant part of the market.  Absolutely none.  Suppose that by asking for a $ 500 phone, Apple makes good money, but take a look at the 1.3 billion mobile phones sold worldwide.  Better our software will be installed on 60, 70 or 80% of them, and not on the two or three percent that fall on Apple.

There are still a lot of white spots on the map of human knowledge.  You can explore them.  So go and fill in these white spots.  Literally every moment is an opportunity to go to these new places and explore them. <br><br>  There is, in all likelihood, no special time that is necessarily the right one to start your own company or your life.  But some moments seem more favorable than others.  Now is the moment.  If you do not take responsibility and do not open up to meet the future, if you do not take responsibility for your life, there is a feeling that no one will do it.  „ <br><br>  <b>Habr, what will be our future?</b> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/196290/">https://habr.com/ru/post/196290/</a></p>
