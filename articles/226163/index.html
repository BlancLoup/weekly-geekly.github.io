  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The most awaited fitness trackers. 5 new market players</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Fitness trackers or physical activity trackers over the past couple of years have become much smarter, more accurate, and today they measure much more parameters than their predecessors.  These devices allow you to take a fresh look at the habits that form the basis of our lifestyle.  Most modern physical activity trackers calculate how much you went or drove, what load you had on each day, calculate how many calories you burned and how well you slept.  The most advanced trackers can be synchronized with heart activity monitors, smart weights and other devices, allowing you to more accurately determine your physical condition. <br><br>  Physical activity trackers are for everyone.  You do not need to be a professional runner or all-rounder to benefit from these devices.  But you need to choose a tracker for yourself so that it suits your personal goals of physical development as much as possible.  Do not seek to buy trackers, the functionality of which exceeds your needs.  Too much information after some time will start to annoy you and your tracker-bracelet will most likely be thrown into the far box.  At the same time, a small amount of information will not be able to provide you with information about what needs to be done to correct your usual actions. <br><br>  In the review we will look at several of the most anticipated new products that may appear on the market before the end of this year, with an emphasis on their functionality.

But its main difference from other similar devices is that it can capture movements unique for such active and extreme sports as surfing, skating, snowboarding, riding a motorcycle, as well as mountain or cross-country bike.  In this case, the device allows you to transfer photos, statistics and other information using social media. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f1f/9d8/bb2/f1f9d8bb29153556dc245acee60c8a90.jpg"></div><br><br>  LIT connects to the Android-based smartphone or iOS user via Bluetooth 4.0.  Batteries last for 4 days.  Given the purpose of the device for extreme sports, a fitness tracker has protection from water and shock. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/01b/3a8/992/01b3a89921af37e0f98150cf1a84a405.png"></div><br><br>  The modular form of the tracker allows you to use it not only with a bracelet, but also attach it to a belt, belt, or just put it in your pocket. <br><br><iframe src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://player.vimeo.com/video/62463482&amp;xid=17259,1500000,15700002,15700023,15700186,15700190,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhh15RxqdOTzAEtDfEiGwVvHuyszUw" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" title="LIT- Full Indiegogo Campaign Video" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  The estimated date of the start of sales is still unknown, you can subscribe to updates on the <a href="http://www.litpro.mx/">official website of the</a> company. <br><br><h4>  Atlas </h4><br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/370/048/219/37004821972084592078f45a6b00692c.jpg"></div><br><br>  Atlas is the world's first fitness tracker that, according to the developers, automatically tracks everything.  This is a device that controls and identifies a person‚Äôs physical activity, evaluating its appearance and intensity, while counting repetitions and sets of exercises, calculating the number of calories expended.  The tracker has a built-in accelerometer and can track the user's movement in three planes and so accurately that it determines, for example, the difference between normal push-ups and push-ups with narrow arms.  For these purposes, the Atlas is equipped with a set of inertial sensors, similar to those used in smartphones.  These sensors track user actions and identify individual movements for each exercise using a set of recorded patterns.  To date, the tracker is able to distinguish approximately 25 exercises from each other. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a78/c77/0c8/a78c770c8a85e0b8bb9e87ae7c3b1eb9.jpg"></div><br><br>  The device automatically records all exercise data, attaching the heart rate to it, so that the user can evaluate how each exercise affects his body.  The device pre-recorded data on various exercises, allowing the user to compare with them their performance and analyze them. <br><br>  During classes, you can not even take a smartphone with you, because a small screen on the bracelet tells all about the type, speed, quality of exercise.  The analytical engine built into Atlas explores all movements of the user, regardless of how much they are used during the lesson, giving as a result information that allows you to achieve your goals.  Moreover, the tracker is able to learn new exercises and teach them to the user.  Atlas is also able to assess how an exercise affects or interrupts your condition, how quickly your heart and breath recover, and so on. <br>  The tracker does not use its own application, but is compatible with several popular fitness programs, such as MapMyFitness or Fitoctracy.  The list of compatible applications, the developer promises to increase. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/09E7-GfyQOw%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,1500000,15700002,15700023,15700186,15700190,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhjIaCzbI-6-NDBAzDWa9BK0a_B9iA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  You can order either on <a href="http://atlaswearables.com/">the manufacturer's website</a> for $ 179, or on the <a href="http://medgadgets.ru/shop/atlas-fitnestreker.html">Medgadgets website</a> for 8900 rub. <br><br><h4>  Gymwatch </h4><br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/471/34a/f71/47134af71e9f7169e07894eea0c3771a.png"></div><br><br>  The Gymwatch fitness tracker, developed in Germany, tracks the entire range of movements during exercise, measuring strength and intensity, muscular load, correct body position, number of repetitions and fixes incorrectly performed exercises.  The device can control any power component, such as, for example, the starting force or explosive force, as, indeed, it can precisely determine the amplitude of movements in each exercise.  Therefore, Gymwatch should interest and professional athletes who are increasing their muscles and are regularly engaged in training with a high load. <br>  Accelerometer, gyroscope and magnetometer are built into the tracker, which allows you to measure acceleration in different directions, recording all movements. <br>  The system provides for the use of two sensors (bracelets) together, which allows you to simultaneously control movements, for example, the left and right arms or legs, if you want to determine the muscular imbalance of your body. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/9aa/420/9fe/9aa4209fe636a3323110142e23967125.png"></div><br><br>  All data can be transferred to your own application based on Android or iOS, which analyzes them and provides recommendations for changing the type or intensity of the exercises.  Information analysis is carried out using scientific sports models, which allows you to predict the effect of training and automatically control the load (create a training plan).  Moreover, the system can track readings in real time, giving you voice recommendations, like a real trainer.  In addition, data can be synchronized with the Gymwatch portal for easier management of classes and their analysis.  A powerful battery allows the device to work 10 - 30 days, depending on the intensity of use. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/XHdqHOtBxcA%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,1500000,15700002,15700023,15700186,15700190,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhh4SGTeE28U9-ulMlnn8vpwrU50tA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  You can pre-order the tracker on <a href="https://www.gymwatch.com/">the manufacturer's website</a> for 129 euros (249 euros per couple). <br><br><h4>  Flyfit </h4><br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/489/0e7/e42/4890e7e427987907ec75868edfd556c6.jpg"></div><br><br>  FlyFit is a fitness tracker designed to be worn not at the wrist, but at the ankle.  The developers explain this by the possibility of more accurate measurements of physical activity indicators and its purpose for exercises, where the legs mainly work.  Indeed, it is strange that in order to understand how cycling or jogging on our physical form is reflected, we must wear the device on the arm, not on the leg.  Well, however, this is a matter of convenience and style rather than measurement accuracy. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/cbc/8dc/1f3/cbc8dc1f33fc3e84ce172659e934152a.png"></div><br><br>  In appearance, FlyFit resembles a similar Sony device - it is also a small device inserted into a bright soft and light bracelet.  The type of physical activity is displayed on the LED panel in the form of 4 symbols, corresponding to cycling, running, walking or climbing stairs.  The tracker can also track the parameters of sleep and swimming (device waterproof).  Moreover, precisely due to the location on the leg, the type of activity is determined automatically. <br><br>  At FlyFit itself, nothing more is displayed, and all the data can be seen in the corresponding application on the mobile device.  And, importantly, in real time.  At the same time, the program uses the capabilities of the smartphone, using GPS to show your location or measuring the speed of running and cycling.  The device works with an application based on iOS or Android, with which the tracker is connected using Bluetooth 4.0. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/_3FQCkJERM4%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,1500000,15700002,15700023,15700186,15700190,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhhmfZsJ8rt22c1SdhIfJ22o8C8dTQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  Learn more and order the Flyfit tracker on <a href="http://www.myflyfit.com/">the manufacturer‚Äôs website</a> or on the <a href="http://medgadgets.ru/shop/flyfit-umnyj-fitnes-treker-dlja-noshenija-na-lodyzhke.html">Medgadgets website</a> . <br><br><h4>  Healbe gobe </h4><br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e55/eca/fa0/e55ecafa08cba6de351698cbd38557e4.png"></div><br><br>  Healbe GoBe is a Russian development, a finest tracker, different from competitors, according to the developers, the most accurate information about human health indicators.  The tracker was developed on the basis of the company's own technology, Flow Technology, has a built-in flash drive with a capacity from 2 to 32 GB, a 5 x 15 graphic dot display and runs on its own operating system. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/642/a7e/14b/642a7e14b305a4375328431ea72ee2c0.jpg"></div><br><br>  The device is equipped with three sensors: accelerometer, resistance sensors and heart rate, which allows you to monitor heart rate, calories burned, blood pressure, sleep quality, change in body weight and even stress and dehydration.  To some extent, the tracker is more like a device for health monitoring than a system for monitoring exercise.  For example, to determine calorie intake (which other trackers do not do), GoBe, through the skin, measures the level of sugar in the body by measuring the resistance of a body segment on the hand.  With sufficient accuracy, according to the developers (this technology has not yet been confirmed by the scientific community and has not been tested).  However, the main indicators associated with physical exercise tracker also measures and visualizes on its associated smartphone. <br><br>  The data in the application, which is available in versions for Android and iOS, is transmitted wirelessly (Bluetooth). <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/zCiXUajPTog%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,1500000,15700002,15700023,15700186,15700190,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhjcxj8VDrjYlLFHtHBEPEC69cmhhA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  You can order the Healbe GoBe tracker either on <a href="http://healbe.com/">the manufacturer‚Äôs website</a> for $ 300 or on the <a href="http://medgadgets.ru/shop/fitnes-braslet-healbe-gobe-braslet-pul-sometr.html">Medgadgets website</a> for 11490 rubles. <br><br>  If you want to be the first to learn about the latest medical and fitness gadgets, follow the company news, subscribe to our pages on social networks.
