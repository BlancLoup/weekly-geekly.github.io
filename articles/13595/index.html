Very interesting and inspiring article.  If you don‚Äôt know yet, Steve Pavlina is an American who writes about personal development and things like that in her blog.  And he and his blog are very popular not only in America, but also here in Russia.  You can easily find translations of his articles.  In two words: Steve is a respected person.

      <strong>Is it possible to make enough money on a blog for a comfortable life?</strong>  <strong>- Yes</strong> , many people have already understood this and earn good money (from a few thousand dollars a month).  If you want, but do not yet know how to start making money on your blog, read this article to the end, in it you will find answers to many of your questions.  And if you do not find, then ask a question in the comments. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  I am sure that most people would like to earn money while sleeping.  This is possible, but not for everyone.  As Pavlina writes, only about one percent of people can make enough money on their blog, and in this I completely agree with him.  After all, to make money on a blog, you need not only to read carefully and write correctly, you also need to possess intelligence and a number of web technologies at a basic level: HTML, CSS, PHP, RSS, feed aggregators, search engine optimization, social networks, contextual advertising, affiliate program. <br><br>  You have not lost the desire to read further?  Then we continue.  As with any serious undertaking, you must have a great desire, perseverance and patience.  You must really want to succeed in making money on a blog.  You must have perseverance to write often (preferably every day) and qualitatively (really interesting articles).  You need to be patient, because it will take some time (a month, two or more) to wait for the result from the blog, and what result you get depends only on you. <br><br>  Before you create a blog, think carefully about everything! <br><br>  First, the <strong>theme of the blog</strong> .  It should be interesting to you, it is very important, because it is difficult to write on uninteresting topics.  Who said that if you plan to make money on a blog, then the blog should be devoted to making money on the Internet?  Maybe you are more interested in cars or photography, or something else that might interest other people.  You should not choose too narrow topics, like ‚Äúcacti‚Äù, because a large number of interested readers for such a blog will be difficult to find.  But you should not write ‚Äúeverything about everything‚Äù, because you will not be able to interest readers, they will not know what to expect from you in the future.  To attract followers you need to create a blog on a specific topic that is interesting to you. <br><br>  Secondly, <strong>hosting and domain</strong> .  Now there are many web services on the Internet a la livejournal.com where anyone who wants can create a blog for himself and write what he wants.  Do not use free options.  They are very limited in terms of editing content and advertising, i.e.  many ways of earning will be unavailable to you.  In addition, free blogs are ‚Äúquoted‚Äù less than those that are hosted on a good hosting and have a second-level domain (myblog.ru).  When choosing a domain name, pay special attention to this issue, select the ‚Äútalking‚Äù name.  For example, vasya-pupkin.ru will not tell you anything about the content of the site, and seoblog.ru says that the blog is dedicated to search engine optimization (SEO - search engines optimization).  From the choice of the domain name depends on the attendance of your blog.  If possible, the name should be short, easy to remember, ‚Äútalking‚Äù and unoccupied. <br><br>  Thirdly, <strong>software for the blog</strong> .  Of course, I recommend <a href="http://wordpress.org/">WordPress</a> (and even better, <a href="http://www.mywordpress.ru/">Russified WordPress</a> ) as a very convenient blogging platform.  In addition to installing WordPress, you will need to make a unique design for your blog, i.e.  choose a topic for him and it is advisable to remake it a little to your taste or give it to specially trained people so that they remade (you can contact me). <br><br>  So, you have decided on the theme of the blog, got hosting and a good second-level domain and installed wordpress there.  Now you just have to regularly write there interesting articles and increase traffic to your blog. <br><br>  And in order to increase the attendance of your blog you need to do a number of operations ... Your blog should have a very long name that conveys its main essence.  To make a name consisting only of a domain name, such as myblog.ru, is stupid.  First, visitors will not immediately understand what your blog is about, they will be offended and leave forever, and secondly, there will be fewer hits from search engines. <br><br>  You need to optimize your blog for search engines, which means that you need to more often (but not too much) use keywords that convey the theme of your blog.  Keywords must be inserted into the headlines of articles, in side panels, in the texts of articles. <br><br>  After writing the first few posts, share the address of your blog with your friends so they can log in and comment on your posts.  Your friends will be your first patrons and commentators. <br><br>  Comment on other people's blogs on similar topics, leave links to your blog, perhaps the authors and visitors to other blogs will become your regular readers. <br><br>  From time to time, write articles for popular resources on your subject (if they provide the possibility of posting articles) and be sure to put a link to your site like "here you will find other articles on this topic -&gt;".  If the resource is popular, and your article will be interesting, then you can get some number of regular visitors to your blog. <br><br>  <strong>How to start making money on a blog?</strong>  You have already started writing interesting and useful articles to the blog and attracted a certain number of regular readers; now you need to start earning the first money on the blog.  For this there are dozens of ways and services on the Internet, from them you need to choose the most appropriate and most effective.  I can offer you the main ways to make money on a blog: <br><br><ol><li>  <strong>Partnership programs.</strong>  Some sites (site) offer you to receive rewards for customers attracted through your site.  Usually after registering on their site you get a link with a unique parameter, place it on your site and get your money for those customers who have gone to siteP and ordered something there.  Affiliate programs have link exchange systems <a href="http://www.sape.ru/">Sape</a> and <a href="http://xap.ru/">Xap</a> , many online stores. </li><li>  <strong>Contextual advertising.</strong>  These are advertisements that appear on your site.  You get rewarded for clicks from your site by the links in these ads.  Earn on contextual advertising offer search engines Google, Yandex, Webalta and the system Runner. </li><li>  <strong>Sale of text links</strong> through automated systems.  You register in <a href="http://www.sape.ru/">Sape</a> or <a href="http://xap.ru/">Xap</a> systems and get paid for placing sponsored links on your blog pages.  The more pages on your blog and the higher its characteristics (TIC, PageRank), the more you can earn. </li><li>  <strong>Direct sale of advertising on the site.</strong>  You can receive money for placing advertising banners and text links on your website. For this, the website usually provides information about the possibility of advertising.  The advertiser contacts you and upon agreement you receive money for advertising.  Usually advertising is placed on one or several months. </li><li>  <strong>Writing custom articles or seo-copywriting.</strong>  You can start writing articles of praise about a particular service or product.  You get acquainted with what the advertiser offers and write a custom article praising the advertiser‚Äôs product or service, and he will give you money for it.  Some bloggers charge $ 10 per 1000 characters in the text. </li><li>  <strong>Donations.</strong>  Put on the blog information about how you can thank for what you have and write such useful articles.  These are usually your bank details or electronic money details. </li></ol><br><br>  These are the main ways to make money on a blog (if you missed something, add).  But no matter how good they are, they will bring a good income if used properly and with high traffic.  The more visitors (traffic) you have, the more income you can get.  If your traffic doubles, then most likely the income will also double.  Try to attract as many visitors as possible and this will give you income. <br><br>  <strong>Motivation.</strong>  Stock up on perseverance and patience, because the first time you will have few visitors, and therefore the income will be low, but try to write at least a month and follow the visitor count.  With the right approach, you will see that during the first month your traffic increased and you started getting the first money from the blog.  This should serve as a motivation for you and you will feel the desire to increase the number of visitors several times and will write what your visitors want from your blog - interesting and useful articles. <br><br>  <strong>Learn <strike>Albanian</strike> English.</strong>  Abroad for a long time and a lot of writing on the topic of earnings on blogs, for example, <a href="http://problogger.net/">Problogger</a> and with knowledge of English, you can learn a lot of useful things for earnings, because all new chips usually appear abroad and only then reach us.  Reading articles in English, you will be one of the first to learn about new ideas for making money on blogs and on the Internet, which will give you an advantage. <br><br>  Write for your visitors and earn on your favorite business! <br><br>  <a href="http://readmymind.ru/">Other Earnings Articles</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/13595/">https://habr.com/ru/post/13595/</a></p>
