Please adjust the total quantity of iPhones to continue. ‚Äù

      What to do, since only two pieces in one order are possible - we will make three orders, two pieces each. <br>  Then I thought that employee logins may be required if the Apple Store does not allow you to make several orders for one login, but everything went without problems.  The money from the credit card was written off, in a couple of hours three confirmations came to the mail. <br><br>  Delivery is promised in three weeks.  Look forward to. <br>  A <b>week has</b> passed.  Today we receive letters that two orders out of three have been canceled: <br><br> <code>Dear ..., <br> <br> Thank you for your interest in Apple Products. <br> <br> To ensure that all customers are given equal opportunity to acquire this product, we have limited the amount available per customer. Our records indicate you have placed a previous order. Therefore this Order has been cancelled. <br> <br> We apologise for any inconvenience caused. <br> <br> Kind regards, <br> The Apple Store</code> <br> <br>  With a slight irritation, I write a polite response <s>to the</s> Apple Store, with a request to restore orders, because it was ordered for living people, and not for salt. <br>  After a couple of hours in the box, a couple of new messages with the headings "Your Apple Order W123456 Has Been Shipped". <br>  I don‚Äôt believe my eyes, I look inside and I‚Äôm terrified: I sent <b>four branded BEZ iPhone bumpers</b> . <br><br>  I have not experienced such deep disappointment for a long time.  What was wrong and what I, as a client, would expect: <br>  - Written 3750 pounds off the credit card immediately, although the delivery is expected only in three weeks. <br>  It would make sense to reserve the goods, inform the client about the receipt and, only then, offer to pay. <br>  - Confirmed the order, and canceled it after a week. <br>  I would expect any compliance checks to occur before order confirmation. <br>  - The order was canceled, and the money has not yet been returned - a week has already been lost, and the three-week period will be considered again.  For a new order, you need to pay extra money. <br>  - Cancel the order selectively at its discretion, in spite of the option ‚ÄúItems will be shipped when all items are available‚Äù. <br>  Here they have iron logic: the order was an iPhone (not available) and a bumper.  The iPhone was canceled, and with it, the only obstacle on the way of the client to the cherished bumper. <br><br>  Here it is, who nibbled an apple ... </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/98641/">https://habr.com/ru/post/98641/</a></p>
