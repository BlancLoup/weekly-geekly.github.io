  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Sarah Connor will not hunt, or Kiki's robot is in a hurry to help</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Robots have always attracted the attention of the public.  How many children worried about Werther's robot when he died saving a man.  And how many people worried about Sarah Connor when the T800 started hunting after her.  Some three decades have passed and humanized robots meet you at the bank, consult at the exhibition and open new car dealerships. <br><br>  Today I want to tell a little about the Russian robot-girl Kiki. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/4ab/4ba/a17/4ab4baa17f3a4b2a9261dd527353d8f3.jpg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  I first saw this funny robot girl at the exhibition when she approached me silently and offered to talk.  Indeed, there was a feeling that I was talking to a person, but the absence of intonation and the ‚Äúmechanical‚Äù notes in my voice showed that I still communicate with the robot.  Later I learned that the robot can work offline, and can be controlled by the operator.

      You can see and hear how the robot behaves. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/K35HUaSTr3g" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  <b>What is it for?</b> <br><br>  At each exhibition, any company is trying to attract attention.  Once at an exhibition of photographic equipment, one of the companies built a stage on which an umbrella reflector with a diameter of almost 3 meters stood.  At another exhibition, someone loudly announced a win-win lottery.  And each time at exhibitions you can see different degrees of dressed girls dressed, who should attract the attention of the public and invite to visit the desired stand.  They are photographed, trying to meet and go on.  Sometimes girls hand out flyers or invitations to the stand.  It is pleasant to an eye, and the number of visitors at the stand does not grow. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/889/e47/9ea/889e479ea1754635964b68adb465f969.jpg"><br><br>  And then I saw a crowd.  Everyone was watching, someone was laughing, someone was taking a selfie.  The robot attracted everyone's attention!  Even more attracted to the fact that the robot-girl was actively communicating with visitors. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/c80/cc3/ad6/c80cc3ad6e61427b9907ac0629fc35bd.jpg"><br><br>  <b>Opportunities promoter Kiki</b> <br><br>  With the work of the promoter robot Kiki copes 100%.  She can turn and speak personally to a specific person, blink eyes, smile and stretch to make ‚Äúhugs‚Äù.  In general, as Kiki herself said: "I can do everything, I just need to be taught."  In a conversation with the engineers, it turned out that the robot is not just a toy, but a rather powerful hardware-software complex. <br><br>  For example, working offline, Kiki can move independently along a given route and greet all the people on the way.  She can memorize the faces and names of visitors, and at the next meeting greet the person by name.  In addition, the robot girl is able to determine the sex, age and emotional state of a person.  Add to this that a number of standard questions she is able to answer instantly and automatically.  And only in an unusual situation, when a question was asked that was not programmed to answer, can the operator intervene.  The operator himself, as a rule, sits a few hundred meters away and quietly drinks coffee and cakes in the nearest cafe.  If necessary, he can take control of the robot and answer any tricky questions.  In addition, the robot may well conduct presentations on its own: on its chest is a touch screen, which may contain a company logo, a slide show, or even a video.  The latter is used less frequently, since it distracts attention from the eyes, but this is also possible. <br><br>  <b>Robot or man?</b> <br><br>  Telepresence robots appeared a few years ago.  They allow you to remotely indicate the presence of a person.  There are specialized robots to perform specific tasks, such as demining or passing through pipes.  But the robot, which itself will be literally walking advertising and entertainment, and will also be able to carry on a full-fledged dialogue with the person - this is something new.  Not even that.  This is the embodiment of the advertiser's dream: it attracts attention, does not get tired and is not capricious, it works 24 hours a day.  Well, the fact that the robo-girl is made of plastic and has no actual similarity with a person is a plus - I think that without preliminary preparation, people would rather be afraid when a cyborg would turn to them.  For lovers of the exotic, there is even a variant of ‚Äútanned‚Äù Kiki. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/549/750/05c/54975005cf6a49728187af7eeb08ad99.JPG"><br><br>  So, who attracts more attention at the exhibition: long-legged girls or robot Kiki?  Girls are photographed, smiling and moving on.  Near the robot stop, take pictures, linger and talk.  The robot definitely entertains and entices visitors better. <br><br>  <b>Conclusion</b> <br><br>  It turned out that robotics in Russia not only did not die, but was at a very high level.  True, this level is maintained exclusively by private capital.  This has the advantage: very fast feedback to any needs.  Just recently, one of the banks decided to put such a robot to meet visitors in one of its branches, and this requires making specific edits to Kiki's behavior.  Private developers will be able to make such edits in a matter of days.  What else I liked was the flexibility of interaction: there is no communication with a search engine that answers questions, but there is also no feeling of communication with a person.  Such a symbiosis of humans and robots leads to the fact that the reporting of information turns into entertainment. <br><br>  I managed to get to the heart of <a href="http://alfarobotics.ru/">AlfaRobotics</a> and look into the holy of holies - the engineering workshop.  But about what I saw there, I will tell you next time.  If any details are interesting, then I will gladly answer in the comments or add the following material. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/05b/4b2/fbe/05b4b2fbe7ed46f59de3f9bff480c38b.JPG"></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/370539/">https://habr.com/ru/post/370539/</a></p>
