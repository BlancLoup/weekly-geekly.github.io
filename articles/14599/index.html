  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Enterprise 2.0: let's be defined. To the new name of the collective blog</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The more they talk about Enterprise 2.0, the less it becomes clear what we are talking about.  Everyone understands the tendency of transition "social" on business rails in their own way.  So what is this Enterprise 2.0 beast and what does it eat?  About this classification note in my iTech Bridge <a href="http://www.itechbridge.com/forum/index.php%3Fshowtopic%3D46373">blog</a> . <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  However, first a few words about the results of a survey conducted in the collective blog ‚ÄúIntelligent Social Web‚Äù.  A question was put to the vote on whether to change the name of the collective blog.  The question was caused by the fact that the concepts of an <em>intelligent social web</em> and a <em>business social web</em> strongly intersect, and I would like to somehow reflect this in the title.  Especially, if we take into account the emerging tendency of the movement of "social" in the business side.  Various versions of the new name have been proposed. <br><br>  More than 55 people took part in the voting.  Of these, only about a third of the participants in this collective blog (the total number of participants at the time of this writing is 119).  Thus, we can say that approximately every fifth member of the blog voted.  Naturally, the "outsiders" for the most part stated that they were not at all interested in this problem.  Why were there so few blog members?  I have already expressed my thoughts on this. <br><br>  Of those who voted for the blog, in general, slightly more than half were in favor of retaining the old name.  The rest chose one of the names, one way or another, taking into account the business application of the Internet.  Based on the approximate equality of the parties with some predominance of ‚Äúintellectuals‚Äù, I made a compromise solution that does not directly coincide with any of the proposed ones.  As you can see, now our collective blog is called ‚ÄúIntelligent Social Web and Enterprise 2.0‚Äù.

      <br>
      By the way, why not the ‚Äúnew social web‚Äù, the name of our community, and how some of those who voted suggested it?  The reason is simple.  Already after the emergence of the Commonwealth, I caught sight of several publications in which it was claimed that one of the features of the new web would be its commercialization.  In other words, they will pay for the content.  Without being yet either a supporter or an opponent of such a concept, I still would like in our collective blog to ‚Äúseparate flies from cutlets‚Äù.  In this case, the intelligence and efficiency of money, regardless of what to take for "cutlets" and what for "flies." <br><br>  <em>Well, now those who still want to finally understand what this ‚Äúbusiness social web‚Äù is can read the note in my iTech Bridge.</em>  <em>The purpose of this note is to try to sort everything <a href="http://www.itechbridge.com/forum/index.php%3Fshowtopic%3D46373">out ...</a></em> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/14599/">https://habr.com/ru/post/14599/</a></p>
