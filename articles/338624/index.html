This time we decided to study the thematic <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item%3Fid%3D14842276">thread</a> on Hacker News and talked about blogs that can well complement reading Habr. <br><br>  The authors of these blogs are preparing as materials for beginners with tutorials and explanations of the basics, as well as more in-depth articles and studies.  All interested are invited under the cat. <br><br>  <i>Disclaimer</i> : we decided to split the selection into several parts in accordance with thematic streams and hubs.  Let's start with blogs on mathematics, algorithms, and programming languages, and in the next releases we will move on to web development and design.

In his blog, the author shares his experience (more than 350 posts), and also writes about biology and physics, solves problems and shares his experience with images.  From 1973 to 1984, Brian wrote articles for <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/">Scientific American</a> , one of the oldest popular science magazines in the United States, which has been published since 1845.  Brian's publications were published in Computer Language and American Scientist.  In 2005, the author of the blog published a book on industrial facilities <a href="http://industrial-landscape.com/">Infrastructure: A Guide to the Industrial Landscape</a> , and in the fall of 2017 his new book Foolproof, and Other Mathematical Meditations will be released. <br><br><hr><br><ul><li>  <b><a href="http://mathr.co.uk/blog/">Mathr</a></b> </li></ul><br>  Most of the blog posts are devoted to mathematics and computer science.  However, besides the mentioned sciences, the author also enjoys drawing (for example, <a href="http://mathr.co.uk/blog/2013-01-03_eschers_butterflies.html">tells</a> how to draw an ornament from butterflies) and <a href="http://mathr.co.uk/blog/2014-07-21_jellyfish_tshirt.html">shares</a> his experience in needlework (for example, describes the process of drawing a jellyfish on a T-shirt).  Most recently, the author <a href="http://www.lulu.com/shop/mathrcouk/morphogenesis/paperback/product-23313473.html">published a</a> book ‚Äú <a href="https://mathr.co.uk/morphogenesis/">Morphogenesis</a> ‚Äù with graphic images based on models of complex biological drawings.  Black and white images for the book were manually selected from 1000 generated options. <br><br><hr><br><ul><li>  <b><a href="https://www.johndcook.com/blog/">John D. Cook</a></b> </li></ul><br>  An expert in applied mathematics, statistics, and software development speaks in a simple and understandable language, such as the Laplace distribution or the Pascal triangle.  John was able to apply his experience of solving problems in the mentioned areas as a software developer at the <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259E%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BA%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BB%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B3%25D0%25B8%25D1%2587%25D0%25B5%25D1%2581%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B9_%25D1%2586%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD%25D1%2582%25D1%2580_%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BC._%25D0%259C._%25D0%2594._%25D0%2590%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580%25D1%2581%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B0">Oncology Center named after him.</a>  <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259E%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BA%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BB%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B3%25D0%25B8%25D1%2587%25D0%25B5%25D1%2581%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B9_%25D1%2586%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD%25D1%2582%25D1%2580_%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BC._%25D0%259C._%25D0%2594._%25D0%2590%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580%25D1%2581%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B0">M.D. Anderson</a> .  The results of the author are available in the form of <a href="https://www.johndcook.com/blog/articles/">articles</a> , <a href="https://www.johndcook.com/blog/presentations/">presentations,</a> and, of course, in the format of blog posts.  Currently, John provides consulting services to companies throughout America and regularly writes about the most interesting problems, tasks, and developments that he has had to face. <br><br><hr><br><ul><li>  <b><a href="https://kpknudson.com/blog/">Kevin knudson</a></b> </li></ul><br>  The author of the blog about which we spoke above highly recommends Kevin Knudson‚Äôs blog to everyone.  And let Kevin not update his blog for a long time (the last publication dates back to 2015), but he successfully implements a project called ‚Äú <a href="https://kpknudson.com/my-favorite-theorem/">My favorite theorem</a> ‚Äù, in which he records podcasts in the format of conversations with mathematicians from all over the world.  Recommended for listening. <br><br><hr><br><ul><li>  <b><a href="http://discreteanalysisjournal.com/">Discrete analysis</a></b> </li></ul><br>  Practically each of the bloggers mentioned above advises reading ‚ÄúDiscrete Analysis‚Äù.  The authors of the magazine claim that it is not at all like other publications on mathematics.  They see differences in the sustained thematic <a href="http://discreteanalysisjournal.com/about">focus</a> and convenient presentation of the material. <br><br><hr><br><ul><li>  <b><a href="http://blog.sigfpe.com/">A Neighborhood of Infinity</a></b> </li></ul><br>  If you want to expand your knowledge of quantum mechanics and advanced mathematics, Dan Piponi will help you with this.  In his blog, the author tries to get away from tedious explanations and uses examples from everyday life, backing them up with diagrams.  The author himself examines Haskell examples, however, materials on linear algebra, logic, and many other topics are interesting to read, even if you work with other languages.  In <a href="https://plus.google.com/%2BDanPiponi">the</a> author‚Äôs <a href="https://plus.google.com/%2BDanPiponi">profile</a> on Google+ or in his <a href="https://twitter.com/sigfpe">Twitter,</a> you can learn about the author‚Äôs life, find posts with interesting links to articles (for example, about testing hypotheses using P-values). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/59/d0/8c/59d08c519415c894146360.jpeg"><br>  <font color="#A9A9A9"><i>/ Flickr / <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/jurvetson/5872448596/">home thods</a> / <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/">CC BY</a></i></font> <br><br><hr><br><h2>  Programming languages </h2><br><hr><br><ul><li>  <b><a href="https://www.mikeash.com/pyblog/">NSBlog</a></b> </li></ul><br>  The blog that has been leading by Mike Ash since 2005 will especially appeal to those who write on Swift.  In the blog you will find tutorials, debriefing and notes from thematic seminars.  Mike regularly responds to readers' questions and has compiled a whole book of weekly Q &amp; A posts.  It is called " <a href="https://www.mikeash.com/book.html">The Complete Friday Q &amp; A: Volume I</a> ". <br><br><hr><br><ul><li>  <b><a href="https://eli.thegreenplace.net/">Eli bendersky</a></b> </li></ul><br>  Python, Haskell and Clojure manuals by Eli Bendersky.  This project began as a personal blog in 2003 and grew into a technology journal, with which the author ‚Äúpumps‚Äù his knowledge and shares open projects. <br><br><hr><br><ul><li>  <b><a href="http://www.stephendiehl.com/posts.html">Stephen diehl</a></b> </li></ul><br>  You can find Haskell problem solving examples with detailed explanations and code examples on Steven Dil's blog.  In addition, the author offers personally tested <a href="http://www.stephendiehl.com/posts/essential_compilers.html">resources</a> for immersion in particular language.  And let the blog is not so many posts, but each of them is written with attention to detail. <br><br><hr><br><ul><li>  <b><a href="http://gigasquidsoftware.com/">Squid's blog</a></b> </li></ul><br>  Karin Meier, a software developer, writes about Clojure, artificial intelligence and robotics.  By the way, most recently in May 2017 the author of the blog published a book ‚Äú <a href="https://leanpub.com/codeshifter">Code Shifter</a> ‚Äù, which she wrote with her daughter.  The book describes the adventures of a 12-year-old girl, Eliza, who has the ability to change the code with just a touch.  During these adventures, Eliza learns to program with friends and learns her strengths. <br><br><hr><br><ul><li>  <b><a href="http://ferd.ca/">As bad as anything else</a></b> </li></ul><br>  Fred Herbert, author of the book Learn Erlang in the Name of Goodness ( <a href="http://learnyousomeerlang.com/">Learn You Some Erlang for Great Good!</a> ) In his blog examines errors and shares guides on Erlang. <br><br><hr><br><ul><li>  <b><a href="http://www.bfilipek.com/">Bartek's coding blog</a></b> </li></ul><br>  The blog of the Polish developer Bartholomew Filipek (Bartlomiej Filipek, aka Bartek) will be of interest to those who are looking for a regularly updated C ++ resource.  Bartek started writing code when he was 14, so behind his back he has a lot of experience in a wide range of areas: from software development to game development.  On the blog, you can find optimization posts, practical advice, latest standards and much more.  For example, <a href="https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/1068743/Cplusplus-Status-at-the-end-of">this</a> article by Bartek was recognized as one of the best on the English-language thematic area for January 2016. <br><br><hr><br><ul><li>  <b><a href="http://www.fluentcpp.com/">Fluent C ++</a></b> </li></ul><br>  The name of the blog speaks for itself.  Inside you will find guides for writing clean C ++ code.  The author of the blog, Jonathan Boccara, shares his 5 years of C ++ programming experience and <a href="https://www.fluentcpp.com/2017/04/04/the-dailies-a-new-way-to-learn-at-work/">employee training methods</a> . <br><br><hr><br><ul><li>  <b><a href="https://existentialtype.wordpress.com/">Existential type</a></b> </li></ul><br>  The blog of Robert Harper, professor of the theory and practice of computers and systems at Carnegie Mellon University, will be of interest to those who would like to immerse themselves in the theory of programming languages.  Especially a lot of information can be found on <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_ML">SML</a> and grid computing.  Professor Harper is also the author of several books, including <a href="http://sml-family.org/sml97-defn.pdf">The Definition of Standard ML</a> and <a href="http://profs.sci.univr.it/~merro/files/harper.pdf">Practical Foundations for Programming Languages</a> . <br><br><hr><br><ul><li>  <b><a href="https://bluishcoder.co.nz/">Bluish coder</a></b> </li></ul><br>  On Chris Dahl's blog, you can get to know a variety of languages ‚Äã‚Äãlike Pony, <a href="https://bluishcoder.co.nz/2007/09/17/vodka-interesting-concurrent-language.html">Vodka,</a> or Haskell.  In addition, in his blog, Chris understands the OS, browsers and network technologies.  Usually he conducts a detailed analysis of a particular subject, accompanying it with a code and explanations, and also reinforces his opinion with references to useful resources.  The blog has about three hundred publications accumulated over 12 years. <br><br><hr><br><ul><li>  <b><a href="http://blog.ezyang.com/">Inside 245-5D</a></b> </li></ul><br>  The name of this blog has evolved smoothly from Inside 245s.  Before that, it was called: Inside T5, Inside P4, Inside 1712B, Inside 2214, Inside 233, Inside 374, Inside 206-105, Inside 214-1E and Inside 245-5D.  The author of this blog, Edward Z. Yang, has evolved with it.  He is now a graduate student at Stanford University and the author of several publications.  Most of all, the blogger is interested in Haskell (for example, the blog has an <a href="http://blog.ezyang.com/2011/04/the-haskell-heap/">illustrated introduction</a> to Haskell work). <br><br><hr><br><ul><li>  <b><a href="http://rubyland.news/">Rubyland</a></b> </li></ul><br>  In the ‚ÄúRuby Country‚Äù you will find the latest news, tutorials and expert opinions about one of the youngest and most popular programming languages.  The resource is updated several times a day - this is one of the best Ruby-themed topics.  Project author Jonathan Rochkind regularly posts posts on his Ruby and web development blog, and Rubyland updates are also <a href="https://twitter.com/rubylandnews">available</a> on Twitter. <br><br><hr><br>  PS Our digests: <br><br><ul><li>  <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/it-grad/blog/337836/">15 code structuring materials for developers</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/it-grad/blog/331620/">100 practical materials on safety, economics and IaaS tools</a> </li></ul><br>  PPS What else do we write in our corporate blog: <br><br><ul><li>  <a href="http://iaas-blog.it-grad.ru/funkcionalnost/balansirovka-nagruzki-v-oblake-iaas/">IaaS cloud load balancing</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://iaas-blog.it-grad.ru/funkcionalnost/virtualizaciya-prilozhenij-kak-pravilno-nastraivat-virtualnye-mashiny/">Application Virtualization: How to Configure Virtual Machines</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://iaas-blog.it-grad.ru/bezopasnost/osobennosti-dvuxfaktornoj-autentifikacii/">Features of two-factor authentication: does it work in the IaaS cloud</a> </li></ul></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/338624/">https://habr.com/ru/post/338624/</a></p>
