  <section class="page js-page"><h1>TheOutloud - voice and share your favorite articles and stories. Part 2</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  I continue to talk about how I learn to program and make my first independent it-project for those who are interested in voicing articles and stories from various Internet portals and sharing them, or keeping their audio blog or podcasts. <br><br>  This time I want to tell you what I managed to do after the first reviews from Habr, how I came to such additions, and also advise several applications for recording sound, which I use myself or recommend to others.  So let's go. <br><br>  A few weeks have passed since I posted the first article where I talked about my first attempts.  It's nice to know that many supported the project and tried their hand at dubbing articles and stories.  At the same time, the community helped to find a bunch of bugs and errors that could cost me as well as the convenience of using the portal, and the security of the project as a whole.

      At the same time, letters began to arrive in the mail with recommendations of new options and functionality.  Most pleased those who immediately wrote that "God forbid on your site, advertising will pop up in the middle of the track or it can not be disabled"!  I will answer that in this matter I am with you, and I myself am terribly annoying when, while listening to music in VK or podcasts on other services, there is constantly an advertisement that you simply must listen to. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/dc1/0be/4a4/dc10be4a44a8a4d3bcafa26a9c5ce6d7.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  But now is not about that.  After I learned to program on lessons on youtube and created the first version of the project, further development went a little easier.  I already knew where to ask for advice, search for documentation, or connect code from various sources.  Yes, my program code is far from ideal, both in appearance and in logic (as I myself suppose), but at least it works well and google page insights give quite positive feedback speed ratings. <br><br>  At first I decided to deal with some bugs and errors that you helped me find.  Basically they consisted of registering users, displaying blocks, navigating through pages and a couple of others.  Now, about a week has passed at the time of their last revisions, and, pah-pah-pah, everything is working properly. <br><br>  There were still shoals with incorrect display of nicknames written in Cyrillic, but the guys from stackoverflow helped to figure out what could be the matter. <br><br>  Several guys wrote that they would like the track to start playing from the place where it was finished listening.  For example, after completing a trip somewhere, you minimize or close the browser window, and later at any time you can continue listening from the right place.  A sufficiently necessary function for such projects, so it was added one of the first. <br><br>  Then I implemented an accelerated version of the audio playback.  Let's say if you listen to a long track, more than 15 minutes, you can speed it up twice.  Yes, the voice of the voice acting becomes ridiculous, but the text and the essence remain clear.  I think this is also an interesting feature, albeit an amateur one. <br><br>  Also, the My Selection section was created and the quick saving of tracks into it.  Sometimes we do not have enough time to listen to your favorite track, or just want to leave it for later.  For this case, you can quickly save it to your compilation. <br><br>  For those who are in a hurry or, on the contrary, have enough time left, it is possible to filter tracks by duration.  A little later, I will add filters such as: the most popular tracks, the most listened, the most marked, etc. <br><br>  Oh, yes, now you can also just put "like" to any track, besides the fact that you can rate the voice and the recording as a whole on a 10-point scale.  As I wrote, ‚Äúlike‚Äù is the easiest way to support the author or idea. <br><br>  For authors and bloggers now also have several innovations.  You can see how many auditions of your recordings were just today in particular.  So you will track the dynamics and growth of popularity. <br><br>  Download avatars is also now available.  I'm still learning how to work with uploading photos and cropping them, so you can only upload square images up to 2Mb.  In addition to your profile, avatars and your brief statistics are now displayed on the filter page when the user wants to find all the tracks that you have uploaded. <br><br>  I still thought that besides the voice acting of articles, stories and posts, it would be interesting for some to keep their audio blog so as not to write long posts, but simply to record on a dictaphone and spread to subscribers.  I think this will be a great addition to text entries. <br>  Soon I plan to add a convenient search on the site, as well as a tag system. <br>  I would be very happy and grateful if at least several participants of Habra will voice their favorite posts or stories from this portal or any other site you love.  My project is based on amateur voice acting, so there‚Äôs no need to be ashamed of your voice.  That's the whole point. <br><br>  In the end, for those who decide to try their voice acting, I will give a few applications that I think are most suitable for this. <br><br>  <b>1) Hi-Q MP3 Voice Recorder (Free / $ 3.49)</b> <br>  One of the most powerful applications for recording sound, as it records directly to mp3.  Along with this, the application allows you to download recordings directly to the dropbox, there is still the possibility of choosing a microphone for voice recording, provided that there are several of them, support for transferring recording via Wi-Fi and some other functions.  In the paid version, a few more options are added, but to be honest, I have not tried them.  The only thing I can say is that the application does not support the recording of telephone conversations. <br><br>  <b>2) Music Maker Jam (Free with in-app purchases)</b> <br>  MMJ is a great app for musicians.  It is perfect for recording songs, music or just voice tracks.  There is also a built-in editor that expands the possibilities for creating interesting entries.  There is also a download to some social networks, such as Facebook or SoundCloud. <br><br>  <b>3) Snipback (Free / $ 1.00)</b> <br>  Another small and functional application.  As in the others, it offers a standard basis: recording, uploading and managing files.  However, it also adds the necessary functions like the choice of recording quality, file recording time and noise removal from the recording. <br><br>  <b>4) Voice Recorder Pro (Free / $ 1.99)</b> <br>  Voice Recorder Pro allows you to record in formats such as PCM (Wave), AAC, AMP and some others.  The interface of this application is extremely simple and straightforward.  It can also record telephone conversations and ‚Äúplay‚Äù with the quality of the recorded sound. <br><br>  <b>5) RecForge II (Free with in-app purchases)</b> <br>  Another great app with a fairly clean audio output.  It is often used by musicians and people who love to sing.  The main functions include the option to change the track speed, turn on / off AGC, support for many formats, work with background mode and reduce battery consumption. <br><br>  <b>6) MultiTrack DAW (Free with in-app purchases)</b> <br>  Great app for the iPhone.  Rather, it is more of a workstation for recording sound than an application for sharing tracks.  You can record audio, trim it, mix, send via Wi-Fi or iTunes File.  It also supports many recording formats and their settings. <br><br>  <b>7) Recorder Plus (Free)</b> <br>  Small and functional.  Like everyone else, it supports multiple recording formats, settings, and works from the background.  At the end of the recording, you can upload the file to one of the connected file sharing services: box.net, Google Drive, Webdav, OneDrive and DropBox.  Gives a fairly clear and clean record.  My personal like this app. <br><br>  <b>8) Voice Recorder &amp; Audio Editor (Free)</b> <br>  One of the most functional applications for iOs.  By and large, everything does the same thing as the others and at the same time it is free for everyone. <br><br>  Well, in the end I want to attach some voice acting, both from Habr and from other resources that you might be interested in: <br><br>  <i>1) The fragility of modern frameworks</i> <br>  <a href="https://theoutloud.ru/play/track.php%3Ftrack%3D286">theoutloud.ru/play/track.php?track=286</a> <br><br>  <i>2) Never distract a programmer</i> <br>  <a href="https://theoutloud.ru/play/track.php%3Ftrack%3D279">theoutloud.ru/play/track.php?track=279</a> <br><br>  <i>3) My utilities</i> <br>  <a href="https://theoutloud.ru/play/track.php%3Ftrack%3D33">theoutloud.ru/play/track.php?track=33</a> <br><br>  <i>4) How scientists discovered gravitational waves</i> <br>  <a href="https://theoutloud.ru/play/track.php%3Ftrack%3D269">theoutloud.ru/play/track.php?track=269</a> <br><br>  <i>5) How to make a difficult choice?</i> <br>  <a href="https://theoutloud.ru/play/track.php%3Ftrack%3D266">theoutloud.ru/play/track.php?track=266</a> <br><br>  As a result, I remind you that the project is absolutely free and without advertising.  I do it for my interest and learning programming.  It will be great if you tell me some more ideas or just add your voice posts, audio blogs and reviews to the site. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/459180/">https://habr.com/ru/post/459180/</a></p>
