Tolley karma, the brand has been tolling the moon phase for several years now, but I have had a similar case two times.  So‚Ä¶ <br><br><h4>  Prologue. </h4><br>  I started using mobile communications at the beginning of this century.  It so happened that my first phone was the Nokia 3310, from which to this day I have only good memories.  I have never come across the Nokia warranty service before this story, probably because they never died of their own death.  Yes, and more expensive phones 15000r.  I never bought.  And then I decided to purchase the newly-born, most functional Nokia flagship - the N95.  Perhaps even more likely for religious reasons than for practical needs in its functionality.  :) <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h4>  Action I. Unsuccessful phone. </h4><br>  This story began back in 2007, when the Nokia N95 was announced, and I decided to purchase it.  The price of the device was 25,990 rubles at the time of purchase, which for a fresh flagship seemed reasonable, albeit slightly overestimated.  Payment was made by bank transfer from a legal entity (this is important).  Within three to four months of using the phone, problems started that were characterized by the following: <br><ol><li>  Not by the day, but by the hour, the loudness of the speaker through which the conversation went went down. </li><li>  Gradually formed a tangible gap of the halves, it broke. </li><li>  One day the phone refused to find the GPS satellites.  More precisely, he found them, but was not going to show the location, referring to a weak signal.  I wrote it off to my province, where this could well be.  But if points 2 and 3 were not so important, then the first one simply killed. </li></ol><br>  Thinking that I first bought the ‚ÄúUnsuccessful Phone‚Äù, I began to look into the issue of searching Nokia's Authorized Service Center (hereinafter the ASC) for repairing it.

    <h4>  Act II.  The first communication with the ASC Nokia. </h4><br>  It so happened that in January 2008.  I was in Moscow, and decided to look into the Nokia service on Tverskaya, where they told me that all my complaints were justified, the repair would be guaranteed, and they offered to leave the phone.  I politely refused, because  the repair period was 2 weeks, and I had to leave 2 days earlier.  I clarified the availability of a service center in our city (they gave me an address in Surgut, the name of the company and its phone number), and left the ASC. <br><br>  Upon arrival in the city, I took the phone to the Nokia ASC.  I received a receipt for the phone in service and it was reported that the maximum repair period is 45 days.  The figure shocked me a little, so I clarified the order of the repair.  Received the following response: <br><ol><li>  Primary diagnosis, from three to five days.  Here, the ASC is considering the possibility of on-site repair, or sent to Moscow. </li><li>  If repair is possible in the ASC, then order a zap.  parts (the delivery time was not specified, but the approximate figure ‚Äúup to two weeks‚Äù was still knocked out). </li><li>  If repair in the ASC is not possible, then sent to Moscow. </li></ol><br><br>  Because  I myself work in the IT field, and it is also related to the warranty service of the population, I am familiar with all the common nuances of this process.  Guided by my experiences, I strongly refused to diagnose at the ASC and demanded to be sent immediately to Moscow.  Naturally, the girl was shocked by such a request and began to tell the tale "Not Allowed."  After a conversation with ‚ÄúThe coolest employee,‚Äù whom I was able to get out of the lobby on that moment, my request was satisfied, though verbally.  On that and decided.  In general, the first impression remained positive. <br><br><h4>  Act III.  Armor is strong ... </h4><br>  Knowing that ANY guaranteed ACS in the majority of cases works according to the principle ‚Äúuntil you kick, don't fly‚Äù (who doesn‚Äôt think so, let the first person make a hara-kiri for himself), I decided to make a call. <br><br>  The first call: 5 days later, "Your phone has passed the diagnosis and will be sent to Moscow."  Well, I thought, it began.  I‚Äôm clarifying why it‚Äôs still from here in the city, because we immediately discussed the delivery of the phone to Moscow.  I could not get a clear answer, but the ‚ÄúCoolest Employee‚Äù was either on vacation or on sick leave, and could not explain anything.  Well, I think, okay.  5 days lost, but what to do.  After that, calls were made after 14, 21 and 38 days from the date of handing over the phone for repair.  All this time I was fed with the phrases ‚Äúat the end of the week - 99% everything will be ready!‚Äù <br><br>  On the 38th day I was informed that I could come and pick up the phone.  Well, I thought, wonderful.  I come, take away, check.  The sound from the speaker is good, there is no backlash.  GPS decided to test on the spot, for which he left the building.  3 satellites were instantly found, I decided that everything was OK.  He returned, signed where necessary, took the phone and went about his business.  In return, he received a pack of documents on the repair of the device.  To say that the phone came to Moscow only 30 (!!!) days after my arrival at the ASC, where it was repaired in 3 (!!!) days, sent back and went 7 days, I think it is not worth saying.  That is, if these clever men immediately sent the phone to Moscow, the repair period would have been reduced by almost 4 times!  Anyway. <br><br><h4>  Act IV.  Seller. </h4><br>  As you all guessed, the phone again began to "perform the praises."  After 2 weeks (!!!), the sound in the dynamics began to fade again, at first it was not so noticeable, but with each passing day the situation became more and more dull.  And after 4 weeks, the GPS refused to work at all, referring to the ‚ÄúSatellite Error‚Äù, which even in the service documentation for the phone (was removed from sites, which I am not very inclined to trust, but still ...) was not indicated.  But the main thing is what happened next. <br><br>  And then, of course, I went to the ASC to make complaints.  There, after much wrangling, which I see no point in describing, it was decided to return the phone to the seller, and in return get the same, but working.  And I went to the store.  The seller immediately sent me to the local service provider.  The first thing he said to me was: "I must give the phone for examination."  I argued with him about the meaning of life and expertise, but the rules are the rules - I gave the phone.  I received in return a piece of paper and a period of "up to three days."  Do I have to say that after three days the phone was left without an expert opinion, for reasons I was not concerned with and went beyond the scope of this article.  It should also be noted that the main warranty period for this device ended on November 4, and I turned to the first seller. <br><br><h4>  Act V. Insolent servicer. </h4><br>  The history of my communication with the seller service provider indicated above is worthy of separate consideration.  It was a man burdened with a seal of intelligence on his face, 30-35 years old, most likely not married, at least I did not notice the ring on his finger.  :) And this dear one, on my replica ‚ÄúYou have delayed something with expertise,‚Äù replies to me that ‚ÄúThey say the phone was purchased from a legal entity, which means it cannot be exchanged, only repairs.  After all, the Law on Consumer Protection at jur.  individuals do not apply.  Moreover, the guarantee for it has generally expired and thanks to me I must say that they will fix it for me at all. ‚Äù  From such arrogance, I hardly found him <s>... I did not send</s> him, I was not rude to him, but I restrained myself.  And I explained to him that the purchase document, in my case it is an invoice in the form of TORG-12, is the basis for the automatic conclusion of the contract according to the Civil Code of the Russian Federation, and I turned to the seller even before the expiration of the warranty, for which I received the answer ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know anything .  Go to the forest.  Phone pick up within 45 days at the place of repair. "  And I put a business card in my hands with the coordinates of the ASC, which, by the way, was different from the one I dealt with for the first time.  By the way, it will be discussed further. <br><br>  From such arrogance and illiteracy of this character, I began to insist on accepting the director, naturally I was kicked off by the secretary, where I received the answer "There will be no reception, the director is very busy, put your requirements in writing.".  And that's all.  Showdown with the secretary, it seemed to me useless, and I decided to write a letter. <br><br><h4>  Act VI.  Letter. </h4><br>  I wrote this letter all day long, without getting out of legal Internet sites and reference books, by the way I learned a lot of new and useful things.  For example, that the warranty period is extended for the period of repair of the device, and if the device is under repair for more than one month, I can demand my money back from the seller.  In the letter, I pointed out exactly which articles of the Civil Code of the Russian Federation designate our relationship with the seller, what terms and conditions (again, according to the Civil Code of the Russian Federation) should be observed (including the warranty extension period, etc.), and of course I mentioned -Not-to-lawyer, that he tried to push me through someone's opinion, clearly not belonging to him. <br><br>  The conditions that were put forward by me this time were unequivocal: take your phone and give my money.  And since the retail price of the device at the time of writing the letter dropped to 18 TR, I assumed that red tape would begin with the <s>cat</s> dragging <s>off the eggs</s> for the terms of the refund, and just in case, in a postscript, I softly advised not to mess with me because of such trifles and return the entire amount to the same settlement account from which payment was made, with the registration of all the proper documents, because  any lawyer and the court will be on my side (in our case, the side of my legal entity).  I signed the letter, stamped it and carried it to the secretary with the telephone.  I was given a review period of ‚Äúup to three days,‚Äù they did not accept the phone. <br><br>  Three days later, I contacted the secretary and received the answer that "While your case is not considered, call tomorrow."  And the ‚Äútomorrow‚Äù and ‚Äúthe day after tomorrow‚Äù case was also not considered.  And now, ‚Äúafter the day after tomorrow‚Äù, I directly began to threaten the secretary, and through his face and the entire store, by the court, and again explain that the case will be decided not in their favor 100%, and they will bear the costs of the process not small. cost is not comparable with the loss of profit from the return of the phone.  After that, I was promised to deal with the situation immediately (read ‚Äútomorrow‚Äù and I left. The next day I waited for the call without waiting for it, I called myself. I was offered to bring the phone to the store. There he was examined by some specialist, checked packaging and condition (not even included), confirmed that everything is OK, and told to wait for the transfer. <br><br> <a href="http://www.google.ru/search%3Fhl%3Dru%26client%3Dfirefox%26rls%3Dorg.mozilla%253Aru%253Aofficial%26hs%3DUh%26newwindow%3D1%26q%3DNokia%2BN85%26btnG%3D%25D0%259F%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B8%25D1%2581%25D0%25BA%26lr%3D%26aq%3Df%26oq%3D"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/019/f48/ade/019f48ade4c6c8bf0b62880fc26c7857.jpg" alt="Nokia N85"></a> <br><br><h4>  Act VII.  The end of the first war, the beginning of the second. </h4><br>  After 8 days after the secretary put the "incoming" on my copy of the letter, I was contacted by Ch.  seller buh and clarified the details of the refund.  After 3 days, the money rested on the r / sch.  my jur  persons, and began the process of choosing the next unit.  Thus, the total term [of the hundred-year war], which was required for a full refund + the repair period for the phone was more than 70 days!  That is, more than 70 days the phone was either not in my hands, or did not work as expected.  The extravaganza with the possession of the Nokia N95 ended 14 months after its purchase with complete disappointment in the device. <br><br>  As I said, I started searching for a replacement for the Nokia N95.  Because  I have long been an adherent of the Nokia brand. My choice fell on the Nokia N85, again, freshly released.  Price for March 2009 amounted to approximately 18000r.  (I don‚Äôt remember right now, but this is not the point).  The seller was chosen Ozon.ru.  The phone was paid, again from the jur.  persons, and sent to me by courier home delivery.  The phone was given to the girl, and at that time, the Nokia 6290 was used (and is still being used) by me. (I can write an article about his problems too). <br><br>  And the heat rushed to the bath.  After 2 months, the phone began to move away from the function keypad and on one fine night in the club, in the dark, it was lost, because  fell off completely.  Here's your time, I thought, quality, ept.  Well, the situation with the guarantee was clear to me, nobody will do it under the guarantee, because  I did not have a lost panel, which means it is the user's fault, which means to refuse the guarantee on this occasion. <br><br>  The phone was delivered to the ASC Nokia, the one, as it turned out, who did the examination of the Nokia N95 at one time.  There, my opinion that the case was not guaranteed was confirmed, the phone was taken away, a diagnostic period was set (that's it, the diagnosis of the fact that the panel fell off the phone) "up to five days."  After 2 days they called back (themselves!), Indicated the issue price of 1,800 rubles.  Not weak for a piece of plastic weighing 3 grams.  + 5 minutes of service, I thought, but what to do.  After 3 (!!!) days the phone was ready!  That's awesome, I thought, that's it, this is the service, this is Nokia!  And having paid the amount indicated on the receipt, I handed the phone over to the legitimate owner.  :) <br><br><h4>  Action VIII.  Warranty - one thing for the other. </h4><br>  Of course, the new socket lasted no more than a month, successfully peeled off and cracked so that it was impossible to use the phone.  I did not stick it on my own, because  This could have drawn unpleasant consequences for me in the form of a disclaimer of warranty. <br><br>  I immediately took the phone back to the ASC, to the same one in which the repair was made, and which was exactly the Nokia ASC.  And oh, horror!  After an honest statement of the situation, the girl at the reception ... REFUSED ME IN WARRANTY!  Like, there was a paid repair, the phone was removed from the guarantee!  I started talking about the performance of paid work (I‚Äôll note not cheap!) In the Nokia ASC, and not somewhere in Gogi‚Äôs market, in the end, poor-quality performance of these paid works!  To which he received the answer "And what if it falls off at you every time, we will do something for you for free?"  To say that I was angry at this service, at Nokia and this ‚Äúsmart‚Äù blonde, is to say nothing.  Now I demanded bosses.  She began to call the ‚Äúother office‚Äù where this boss was based, they did not pick up the phone for more than 15 minutes, my patience came to an end, I took the coordinates of the office and went there personally. <br><br>  It was the same, small in size, a typical SC with a reshen.  The girl broke through my phone on a certain ‚ÄúIMEI Nokia base‚Äù, and it turned out that the phone was not removed from the guarantee, I advised them to dismiss my previous interlocutor, for which I received approving views of the current one.  :) <br><br>  The phone was handed over, terms announced by me ‚Äúup to 5 days of diagnostics, up to 45 days of repair‚Äù were announced, I did speak a bit in line with ‚ÄúYes, you are <s>already</s> tired of <s>... for Bali</s> !  What are 45 days ?!  Why for money 5 days, and under warranty 45? ‚Äù, But what to do ... <br><br>  I gave the phone, I got the paper. <br><br><h4>  Act IX.  Nokia service in Surgut - G ... BUT! </h4><br>  Otherwise, to name what happened next, I just can not.  A week later, I called the ASC, I was told that ‚Äúordered zap.  part, delivery time up to 2 weeks. "  The period of 2 weeks seemed adequate to me, since  I often bring goods by train, and there delivery times from Moscow are just 2 weeks.  I call two weeks later, and I hear ‚ÄúHere you have, it turns out, another app.  Part of the need to change, wait another 2 weeks. <br><br>  I was no longer shocked by this state of affairs, but just started sternly scolding the ASC and Nokia, citing the terms of paid repairs and arguments, ‚ÄúWhat is the second spare part ?!  There the panel just fell off! ‚Äù.  After such raids and insults towards her place of work, the girl obviously offended me, but business is business, there is no need to be offended.  I hung up with the phrase "Two weeks, not more !!!".  After 48 (!!!) days (this is when 45 on the receipt is the maximum!) I called the ASC again.  And after the phrase ‚ÄúZap.  the part has not come yet, wait for 2 weeks ‚Äù, I could not stand it any longer and began to raise my voice, demanding the bosses of this office. <br><br>  With me, they connected a certain ‚Äúassistant on all questions of the <s>Tsars-father</s> of the ASC director‚Äù, from whom I finally heard the words of apology, and the offer to take my phone <s>and roll it off</s> and return it to the seller.  I explained to her that the phone was bought in Moscow, by bank transfer and not everything is so simple, so let's do it, and then I'll figure it out myself. <br><br>  She convinced me that zap.  the part will come out on Monday, on Wednesday it will be ‚Äúunpacked‚Äù and on Friday it may be installed, since  "a lot of work".  I said that in general they were already <s>oh ... ate</s> insolent and demanded that my device be made first of all, since  All imaginable and unimaginable deadlines were thwarted.  Well, the details of how I received verbal approval of their requirements, I omit.  The fact is that I was promised that ‚Äúin 2 weeks and two days everything will be done in the best shape‚Äù and her personal mobile was left for operational, so to speak, communication. <br><br>  So, another 16 days go by, I‚Äôm calling by mobile phone - of course no one answers. <br>  I call in the ASC.  The girl at the reception tells me a fairy tale that they have a lot of work, blah blah blah and the phone is still not ready for me, and the FIG knows when they will do it, probably on the next.  a week  With a confident, loud voice, I begin to demand privileges for my occasion, telling about dead dates, etc., to which I get ‚ÄúWhy would that be ?!  In queue!!!".  I hang up the phone with the words ‚ÄúYou will make it all the same to me within a day, or I will not,‚Äù I call back to the cell I left earlier earlier, and lo and behold, I dial up.  First of all, I recommend to teach an employee at the reception to talk, and before making loud statements, deal with the situation.  I ask the question "When will be ready."  I get the answer "Tomorrow, <s>I give a tooth</s> ." <br><br>  I call on the next.  day in the morning.  The phone is ready.  Come, take away.  The panel is in place, the phone has a new firmware (I have a complaint about it, because the phone began to work obviously slower, but this is beyond the scope of this article).  That same secret app.  the part that was suddenly needed to replace the plastic panel turned out to be a new LED screen (!!!).  Well this is necessary, I thought, signed and left. <br><br><h4>  Epilogue.  Will we write it together? </h4><br>  A week later, the panel began to show insignificant signs that it was ready to come off again, but not so serious that it should be carried back to the ASC.  Now I want to know from you, who have read this play to the end, habra people, how legitimate is it to return this phone to ozone, demanding money back or another phone?  After all, 2 weeks from the moment of purchase clearly passed, and at the moment it is in working condition, with no flaws visible for any kind of expertise.  I would like, of course, to return the money, although another phone for the same amount would be fine with me. <br><br>  I did not call up with ozone yet, I decided to write here for a start.  Who thinks about this? <br><br>  PS: Names jur.  persons of the seller of the first phone (the store is living its last days), and both the Nokia ASC (the second one is still functioning, but I‚Äôm not sure about the first one), didn‚Äôt signify.  To whom it is interesting (and if there are representatives of Nokia here, then they should be very interested in this) I will provide by e-mail. <br><br>  <b>UPD:</b> Thanks for the karma.  Transferred to the "Consumer Protection". <br>  <b>UPD:</b> At the request of the commentators, he created a survey in which you can evaluate the quality of Nokia service in your city / region.  Most interesting, pathology is or is an exception.
