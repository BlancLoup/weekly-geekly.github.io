  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Uber Driver in Chelyabinsk and the password from the Top 30</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/91b/5a5/618/91b5a56181eb4cd988e1df5c3b974994.png" alt="Uber. Need drivers"><br>  I have a couple of hours of free time in the morning, so I decided to test Uber as a driver. <br><br>  Never worked as a driver before.  I am a programmer - I make installers using InstallAnywhere, InstallShield, SMPE, I write in Java, Python, VBscript, REXX.  80% of the time working from home. <br><br><h4>  Registration and password from the Top 30 </h4><br>  To become a driver, you need to register on the Uber website, set a meeting time and drive to the office.  In the Chelyabinsk office of Uber, my documents were photographed, and I was reset to the account password for <b>11111</b> .  When registering, I set a completely different password. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  ‚ÄúEnter the password in the application and you can already go to receive orders‚Äù - the cheerful girl announced to me in a cheerful voice, stretching a square piece of paper with a login and password. <br>  Of course, I went home, looking for an opportunity to change the password and read manuals on how to become a good Uber driver. 
      <br>

      <br>
    <h4>  Personal Area </h4><br>  The profile can not change the password, there is simply no such function <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b1a/9fa/532/b1a9fa53244a44049bbe598bc5465878.PNG" alt="Uber. Personal Area"><br><br>  On the <a href="https://help.uber.com/">help.uber.com</a> in the article ‚ÄúHow to reset the password?‚Äù There was a link ‚ÄúI CAN‚ÄôT <a href="https://help.uber.com/">JOIN THE</a> NETWORK‚Äù.  It was not working in Firefox 49.0.1. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/101/2d0/6dc/1012d06dc3ba488ca807c95d29c4c205.PNG" alt="image"><br><br>  As a result, it was possible to request a password change in Uber via the link <a href="https://login.uber.com/forgot-password">login.uber.com/forgot-password</a> .  She was found in a letter that arrives when you register at uber.com. <br>  On the problems with the password and its change, I unsubscribed in those.  support  They promised to fix it. <br><br><h4>  Uber Driver application </h4><br>  The application itself runs at 5. For a week of testing, it worked stably and predictably.  You can not go to <a href="https://partners.uber.com/">partners.uber.com</a> at all, all its functionality is in the application. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/151/2fa/b58/1512fab58ecb4f938944fde02fdccded.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h4>  First passengers </h4><br>  Carry the first passengers was scary.  The feeling was that only yesterday I got the rights.  In addition, I do not know the city.  Later I just had to learn the main streets of my area. <br>  All passengers were polite, neatly dressed and almost all the way looked into their smartphones.  Only three glamorous girls, without ceasing to speak for a second, discussed their own and false nails, eyelash extensions, tinted shampoo and vitamins from SportPit.  When there were no more topics, they started cracking about Instagram. <br><br>  Another important detail.  Uber is positioning itself as an app, not a taxi.  So when I called customers, I asked something like, ‚ÄúHello, did you call the car through the Uber app?‚Äù <br><br><h4>  Navigation in yards </h4><br>  All the trips I did through Yandex. Navigator.  I don‚Äôt know how it was intended, but in fact, when laying a route around the yards, only stochastic algorithms are used.  You can easily die of hunger, if you trust Yandex. Navigator to bring you to the shop with food in the courtyards. <br>  Only once I rode the navigator to the desired address.  Usually I opened 2Gis on the second smartphone and was already oriented or called the customer on the spot to ask for directions. <br><br><h4>  Orders and revenues </h4><br>  At peak times a lot of orders.  You are still carrying one customer, and the application for the next one is already arriving - this is called the ‚Äúvotlet‚Äù application.  They need to take, otherwise you will not get a bonus.  Uber pays well for trips. <br>  Here is a scheme of subsidies for Chelyabinsk for one of the weeks of October, it is immediately clear which watch is the busiest. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/677/81c/46f/67781c46f4ab447e90debb464e1d70a1.png" alt="Uber. Bonus"><br>  In the first week I got 4,200 rubles and 10 hours of work.  Rating from Uber 4.88. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/7f0/562/4c6/7f05624c67c7407dbe5939359eff98e9.jpg" alt="Uber. Accruals"><br><br>  Since the end of October, the bonus scheme has changed and become more thoughtful, as the previous scheme motivated drivers to come to the center in the morning and not go anywhere else. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e4a/c54/3ce/e4ac543cea7c4f77b80fc60fb3cdcc1b.png" alt="Uber. Bonuses at the end of October"><br><br><h4>  Total </h4><br>  In general, Uber leaves a positive impression.  In my opinion it is convenient for both the driver and passengers.  I liked being a driver, but engineering work is still more interesting. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/398671/">https://habr.com/ru/post/398671/</a></p>
