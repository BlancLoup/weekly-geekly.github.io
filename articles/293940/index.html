Despite a lot of expert methods for assessing information security risks, I have not been able to find methods that at least somehow assess the risk of insiders and the human factor. <br><br>  That is why I would venture to propose this approach for discussion.  The solution is still very raw and first of all I am interested in your opinion on the topic ‚ÄúShould I develop the methodology further‚Äù and ‚ÄúThere are so many similar approaches, why reinvent the wheel.‚Äù <br>  So, if anyone is interested, welcome tackle. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h5>  <b>Part zero.</b>  <b>Lyrical.</b> </h5><br>  In one of the conversations with my girlfriend, I somehow touched the issue of interpersonal relations as economic transactions.  For example, if you are asked to meet you at the station and drive home, then in essence you are offered to conclude an agreement for the provision of transportation services, in exchange for this person's society and his good attitude (trust). <br><br>  Then I asked her ‚Äúwhat mileage, do you value your society?‚Äù, I just wanted to know how far she would go, but then everything turned out completely different.  She was angry with me, but I could not say anything, because the idea had not yet formed.

    <h5>  <b>Part one.</b>  <b>Introductory.</b>  <b>Your self esteem.</b> </h5><br>  To begin, consider the relationship model using the example ‚ÄúGive a friend a lift‚Äù.  We define the terms: <br><ul><li>  The buyer is a person who acquires the service, in our case the one who is brought; </li><li>  Seller - the person providing the service, the one who drives up; </li><li>  The credibility is a certain ratio of relationships, from the experience of past contacts; </li><li>  The coefficient of confidence is a certain indicator, how many people are sure that they will not be refused help. </li></ul><br><br>  As a result, we get a deal where, the buyer offers a certain price, taking into account the experience of past calls (the coefficient of confidence), and the seller decides to provide the service, taking into account the relationship history (The trust in this context is very similar to the credit history when receiving the loan). <br><br>  And it‚Äôs not hard to see that in interpersonal relations it‚Äôs not the buyer, but the seller plays the decisive role.  The buyer can only offer some compensation for the inconvenience presented to the seller, and he already decides whether it is worth it or not. <br><br>  Here we can make an intermediate conclusion: Your self-esteem is worth just as much as you are willing to deliver discomfort to others. <br><br>  <i>Self-esteem = (Compensation / inconvenience caused)</i> <br><br>  As you understand, in this case, the concept of self-esteem is tied to specific relationships.  After all, when dealing with some people, you can show arrogance, and with others, on the contrary servility. <br><br><h5>  <b>Part two.</b>  <b>Estimated.</b>  <b>Your dedication.</b> </h5><br>  Since we have decided on a person‚Äôs self-esteem, we can, on its basis, assess the extent to which he is ready to tolerate additional inconveniences, without changing loyalty.  That is, we will try to assess the devotion of a person in monetary terms, no matter how blasphemous it sounds. <br><br>  In this case, we will rely on the relationship between the employee and the employer, because in them the Compensation for inconvenience is rigidly fixed and expressed in the form of wages.  And the inconvenience provided can be replaced by the operating time in hours.  As a result, we get: <br><br>  <i>Self Esteem = Salary / Work Time</i> <br><br>  Now we divide the work time into what the employee is obliged to do, and what he does additionally.  If the employee avoids the performance of their duties, we will consider the processing negative. <br><br>  <i>Work time = work + processing</i> <br><br>  We will establish that during Processing = 0, the employee‚Äôs self-assessment is 1. <br><br>  <i>Salary / Work = 1</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Salary = Work</i> <br><br>  In the case, if the Refining is present, we get an equation of the following form: <br><br>  <i>Salary / (Work + Recycling) = 1</i> <br><br>  Those.  we determined that by processing (whether positive or negative) employee compensates for his self-esteem.  We will also determine the percentage of time that an employee spends on work and on processing separately.  Suppose P is time to work, P is time to recycle. <br><br>  <i>P + P = 1</i> <br><br>  Then we can derive the relation: <br><br>  <i>Self-esteem / (P * Salary) = 1 / Salary</i> <br><br>  Consequently, we can express self-esteem: <br><br>  <i>Self Esteem = (P * Salary) / Salary</i> <br><br>  Well and, accordingly, the Time spent on Processing, similarly determines loyalty. <br><br>  <i>Loyalty = (P * Salary) / Salary</i> <br><br>  This, of course, is a very rough estimate, since it is still necessary to add a loyalty coefficient, some personal characteristic, but this example determines the main direction. <br><br><h5>  Part Three  The final.  Practical significance. </h5><br>  It remains to answer the question, why is all this necessary. <br><br>  In my opinion, in addition to the goal outlined in the beginning of the article, assessing employee loyalty, this methodology will also be useful for HR managers when determining employee motivation. <br><br>  In matters of information security, trust is a much more important factor.  Starting from the fact that you can not control employees around the clock, which means you have no guarantees for the absence of leakage.  And if you are sure that employee loyalty is higher than the value of the information to which he is admitted, then you can reduce the cost of control of this employee. <br><br>  Thus, this methodology can make significant adjustments to the organization of the work of security services, provided that it is brought to a suitable state. <br><br>  <b>PS</b> I did not want to publish this work in such a raw form, so I hope for your constructive criticism. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/293940/">https://habr.com/ru/post/293940/</a></p>
