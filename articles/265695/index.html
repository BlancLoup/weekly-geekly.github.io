One of these articles told about the reasons for which the user may decide to remove your program.  We decided to continue this topic, but from the technical side. <br><br>  Immediately it is worth mentioning that most often inexperienced developers do not provide for two things: a security system for the application and additional server resources in case of popularity growth (ordering pizza, choosing clothes, searching for a restaurant, etc.).  We will talk about all this today.  Note that the article deals with ‚Äúconnected‚Äù applications - with its own server, database, dynamic content and other attributes. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h3>  Problem: application performance drops as user base grows </h3><br>  If users ten, one hundred, one thousand, the problem can not be noticed.  But if the bill has already gone to tens of thousands?  The application may already be hanging for a long time, issuing the information requested by the user late. 
      <br>

      <b>Solving the problem:</b> you need to improve performance; you can do this, for example, by converting mobile user requests into regular requests that receive content ‚Äúon the go‚Äù in response.  In addition, some data can be cached, and not dynamically output for each user each time (for example, the number of comments). <br><br><h3>  Problem: large objects in the database </h3><br>  Saving images and other heavy objects in the database results in poor application performance.  This is especially pronounced with the growth of the user audience. <br>  <b>Problem Solving:</b> Avoid storing massive sets of binary data in this form.  Plus, consider deleting data that no one will request for a long time. <br><br><h3>  Problem: DDoS Himself </h3><br>  As an example, we can take the case when the developer plans to introduce a new function of the application and notifies all users of the program.  This can lead to a huge load on the server, as a result of which it will simply cease to function normally. <br><br>  <b>Solution of the problem:</b> divide your users into groups and send notifications to each group sequentially, and not to all at once.  This will provide all users with an update, but the server load will not be excessive. <br><br>  This way of notifying users will help to better track the effectiveness of feedback, as well as marketing campaigns, if you conduct them (sales, gifts, discounts, etc.). <br><br><h3>  Problem: users notice application errors </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/fc1/8b9/249/fc18b9249c89892c45761a9a555c8083.jpg" alt="shutterstock_177863339 poor app experience" height="530" width="800"><br><br>  Popularity is good.  But if the application has already received a large user base, it may happen that when working with the program they will begin to encounter various problems and software errors.  For example, it could be a timeout of the north, resetting the connection or resetting the update (as happened recently with the software of one popular corporation). <br><br>  <b>Solution of the problem:</b> it is necessary to provide it at the very beginning, before you get a large user base.  It is worth analyzing what can happen if a user starts writing a long review, and the connection is suddenly dropped.  Or if the user tries to register in the application, and the registration confirmation is delayed, and not for a minute or two, but for a long time. <br><br>  Try to think over most of these problems at the design stage of the application.  Add the ability to authorize users through third-party services. <br><br><h3>  Problem: there are too many ads in the application </h3><br>  Some developers are trying to get as much money as possible, monetize the application to the maximum.  As a result, the program is equipped with pop-up banners and regular banners, plus offers to buy something.  All this annoys the user. <br><br>  Problem solving: application monetization should be approached wisely, using original ideas and new methods (for example, <a href="http://megamozg.ru/company/appodeal/blog/18386/">native advertising</a> ).  If you have problems with monetization, try <a href="http://appodeal.ru/">registering with Appodeal</a> , and we will help raise the yield on each position.  Maybe after that you decide to turn off some advertising for the sake of users. <br><br><h3>  Problem: Security as a matter of primary importance </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/cc2/438/438/cc2438438fd1e6cd0a5e864a8699da9c.jpg" alt="Security (photo by Negative Space)" height="533" width="800"><br><br>  Many companies and startups do not provide reliable security measures for their products.  As a result, users' data is at risk - they can be ‚Äúled off‚Äù without any special problems, there would be a desire. <br><br>  <b>Problem solving</b> : Servers with database and API must be kept up to date by regularly updating individual software components.  This is not always an easy task, so you need to plan technical activities in advance. <br><br><ul><li>  Do not use passwords to access remote servers, it is better to use SSH instead. </li><li>  Restrict access to the database, instead it‚Äôs better to use SSH. </li><li>  Document planned and implemented security measures.  Make sure that the measures you take will really ensure the security of the data and the application itself. </li><li>  Store public, private, and protected data separately, using different access levels for each data group. </li><li>  Hash and "solite" your passwords, encrypt users' personal data such as phone numbers, or do not save them if this is not necessary. </li><li>  Give users the ability to delete their data from the system. </li></ul><br><br><h3>  Problem: the application is removed immediately after installation, even without going into it </h3><br>  Your program may be the result of the implementation of a good idea, but not all users are convinced of the need to use it.  Sometimes users don't like the app.  Simply do not like it. <br><br>  <b>Solution of the problem:</b> we described this problem in sufficient detail <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/appodeal/blog/265693/">in the last publication</a> . <br><br>  <b>As a conclusion</b> : In general, such problems can be foreseen at the design stage of your application.  If a rational approach to development, it is right to plan and implement everything, then difficulties, at least similar ones, will not appear.  In the meantime, we wish you a maximum of users and a minimum of problems. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/265695/">https://habr.com/ru/post/265695/</a></p>
