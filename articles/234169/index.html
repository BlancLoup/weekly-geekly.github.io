  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Do not know what your client needs - ask</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  It is important to determine exactly what goal you set yourself when starting a survey.  You are not a researcher and you do not have to collect an array of statistical information. <br><br>  When launching a survey, you should already be ready to act immediately, i.e.  You must prepare appropriate plans for each of the possible survey options.  If you think that it is impossible to predict such options, you need to carefully review your approach to this procedure. <br><br>  <i>What can be considered a successful survey?</i> 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>

      <br>
      If about 40% of users answered your questions, you have achieved an amazing result.  Normal level is considered 15-20% of users. <br><br>  A few simple rules to get the most out of polls: <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b>1. Polls should be short</b> <br><br>  The graph below shows the relationship between the number of questions and the number of users who answered all the necessary items.  It clearly shows the inverse relationship between the number of questions asked and the number of users who answered them. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/928/e62/d40/928e62d4009e47f899326fcf51b08b6c.PNG"><br><br>  In addition, time frames are of paramount importance, the critical limit is five minutes.  Timing is really important: as the statistics show, the critical drop in the number of users who answer your questions begins after overcoming the 15-point barrier of the questionnaire.  The optimal number is about 5-8 questions; it is precisely with this size that there is a chance that the number of respondents in percentage terms will correspond to ‚Äúindustry standards‚Äù. <br><br>  Therefore, you must select the questions that will bring you the most useful information. <br><br>  <b>2. Questions should consist of two parts.</b> <br><br>  The clearer the question is formulated and the more detailed the instruction is given, the more likely it is to obtain the necessary data.  The shorter the question, the easier it is for perception.  It is worth remembering that short-term memory most effectively saves 5-7 objects.  In order for the user to quickly navigate the question and give an answer in the form that you need, it is enough to divide the question into two conditional parts: <br><br>  <i>The first part is introductory:</i> in it you have to orient the client, what is at stake.  For example, if you collect information about the education of your visitors, the wording will suit you: ‚ÄúWhat is your education?‚Äù.  The wording must be accurate and avoid double interpretations. <br><br>  <i>The second part is the instructions:</i> in this part you have to tell the visitor what he should do to answer the question.  Select one or more of the options presented, specify data in a specific format, or evaluate something on a scale.  This part saves the user from the need to spend time and effort on understanding what is required of him, and greatly increases your chances of obtaining the necessary information. <br><br>  <b>3. Ask exactly what you need.</b> <br><br>  When starting a survey, you must have a certain hypothesis that you plan to confirm or deny thanks to the data obtained.  Accordingly, each question in the form should bring you closer to the goal. <br><br>  Avoid general and introductory questions that do not carry specific information, avoid duplicating questions.  In addition, do not exclude questions whose answers may be unpleasant to you.  Your task is to gather information useful for the development of the site, and not laudatory reviews about your work or the work of your colleagues. <br><br>  <b>4. Do not use assumptions.</b> <br><br>  The question ‚Äúwould you buy it if it met all your requirements?‚Äù Has an obvious answer.  The question ‚Äúhow do you react to the hypothetical changes in the design?‚Äù Pushes the user into a stupor, as he doesn‚Äôt imagine how convenient this or that feature will be until he tries it out personally. <br><br>  The survey should bring you useful information about the current state of affairs.  If you want to know the opinion of users about some innovation, combine the survey with A / B testing, giving the visitor a page in the form that you want to evaluate. <br><br>  <b>5. Ask about the quality of the test.</b> <br><br>  In order not to wait for a meaningless, unsuccessfully framed end of the test, you can simply ask the user about how clear the questionnaire is and if there are any difficulties in answering the questions posed.  If you receive a significant amount of feedback that it is difficult to give an exact answer to your questions, you need to make changes to your wording. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/234169/">https://habr.com/ru/post/234169/</a></p>
