And indeed, when I asked Owen whether his city was big, he said no, a <b>small one ‚Äî no more than three million</b> .  Okay. <br><br>  After 35 minutes we arrived at something like the center of the ShZh, another 15 minutes walk and we are there. <br><br>  Passing through a long building, I could not help noticing that in every window one could see some racks stuffed with electronics, work tables, people scurried around ‚Äî every door in this building has its own workshop, a small life with small ups and small falls. <br><br>  Near one of these doors we were met by a pink-cheeked plump Chinese who led our noisy company inside. <br><br>  There turned out to be not a very large bright room in which six people worked. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e80/d23/dc6/e80d23dc66c5fcc4353a57b6687f5a22.jpg"><br>  <i>This black guy is not working here - this is our colleague.</i> <br><br>  All corners are filled with boxes - some with already finished products, others with components. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/43f/dfb/ac1/43fdfbac1376f4f26a1503245e379c1f.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/789/450/6eb/7894506eb9e426ac035262fc04f0e906.jpg"><br><br>  On the tables of the placer of plastic cases, printed circuit boards with already soldered components bulge out of the boxes in all directions, on special trays USB transmitters modestly lie in orderly rows.  Wheels, legs, plastic lenses for a laser, all this in some kind of difficult-to-determine order, known only to employees. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e55/b6e/911/e55b6e91178fe0ead9c3024e81459e98.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/600/62e/a92/60062ea92a2d6575c202f193c10d66bf.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/421/fc9/d27/421fc9d276f9519eea86f3b343f1462b.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e7d/19c/0e0/e7d19c0e067ae312f8cbb92ecd26634a.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f61/27b/a8d/f6127ba8d481ffce596ae36ea674d291.jpg"><br><br>  By and large, in this workshop only assembly and testing takes place - all the components come ready.  They do not melt the case, do not develop USB transceivers, do not even produce foot stickers.  Boards come ready. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/af6/c3d/024/af6c3d0240b438661ca50d029c349a25.jpg"><br>  <i>This is a blank for 8 mice.</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a22/669/099/a22669099d550c8df32b78fcb5441b31.jpg"><br>  <i>This is what a mouse handkerchief looks like, remotely resembling a Maykrosoftovskaya</i> . <br><br>  The tasks of the guys at this table are extremely simple: someone prepares the boards, separating one from the other and removing unnecessary parts, someone picks up the components and assembles the mouse, someone glues the legs. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/0ae/c05/250/0aec052502c6cbf6ae93efcd5f3ba797.jpg"><br><br>  But there are also two (and judging by the number of jobs, perhaps three) guys with work requiring a little more attention - they check the mice - the movement of the cursor, mouse click, scrolling with the wheel.  If something is wrong, they immediately disassemble the mouse and solder the contacts. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/df4/d1e/14b/df4d1e14b175890d935bd508939608a4.jpg"><br>  <i>They have computers.</i>  <i>Caste</i> . <br><br>  It so happens that the mouse refuses to work with this USB transmitter.  Then they unsolder the old radio module and solder the new one.  Unfortunately, it was not possible to understand how they pick up the module to USB - the insuperable difficulties of the language barrier. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/cec/217/b58/cec217b5893680650851945de40f8773.jpg"><br><br>  At the workplace, they have a soldering station, an automatic screwdriver and a bunch of various parts.  Apparently, they are ready to solve problems not only with the radio module. <br><br>  The computer is used only to check the mouse, as I understand it.  Here the application is running and now the boy is fiercely hammering on paint and varnish materials.  See, she already blushed. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/92c/29a/a40/92c29aa40e4a0f13231c821cf03f8f0d.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/cbe/1a4/16f/cbe1a416f4efb8de25b7441734061ef7.jpg"><br><br>  The owner of this mini-factory, after long convictions, nevertheless realized that he was being asked to show a master-class on collecting a mouse. <br><br>  Actually, there was no magic in this, of course.  The process is debugged. <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/620/ea1/3a3/620ea13a3497072e5cf88e8cfcb4951f.jpg" width="180"></a> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/5ec/365/702/5ec36570244892c1795a2f891ce580c6.jpg" width="180"></a> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/599/fa9/a0b/599fa9a0bc43c16480970739fcc7f13a.jpg" width="180"></a> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/737/f19/889/737f19889422c07e6b9d13af3b1cf61b.jpg" width="180"></a> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/11a/b56/4b7/11ab564b763eb55538ffccd9dbe8081a.jpg" width="180"></a> <br><br>  At the end of our excursion, or it would be more correct to say, the owner of the workshop said that he could take one mouse of any kind free of charge. <br><blockquote>  Here I want to draw attention to the openness and friendliness of the Chinese.  I watched her throughout my stay in ShZh.  We could shuffle a bunch of mice, a bunch of parts, in such a confusion no one would have seen it, but no one even tried to control us.  I think that in China there is simply no such habit - to steal.  Even on the bus in some cases (especially in Beijing) no one stands over you - there is not even a controller - you leaned the card at the entrance once, at the exit - the second one, well, or just threw 2-3 yuan into the piggy bank. <br>  In the Civil Code many times I observed the situation when people throw their heavy bags on the first floor of the bus, while they themselves go to the second. <br></blockquote><br>  Naturally, these are all copies of some well-known brands.  Copies do not say that they are of the highest quality, but at least they do not look bad and work.  Yes, and they cost 15 yuan.  Therefore, in addition to the gift, our company also bought 30-40 mice from him for gifts to friends and colleagues. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/875/a45/28d/875a4528dff39f2c8996fd70f51c5ee1.jpg"><br>  <i>Our colleague from Nepal collected a package of mice as a gift</i> . <br><br>  And here is the owner of this workshop, Mr. Venchon Liu (on Wenxiong Liu pinyin): <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/604/eb9/74f/604eb974f1520c3bec096feb58e7a90f.jpg"><br>  <i>In China, some kind of mania for this here Julius monkey.</i> <br><br>  And finally, surely you are interested in working conditions and performance: <br><br>  <b>10,000 mice per month</b> , that is, 500 per day or about 40 per hour - the figure is not fantastic, let's say - quite normal. <br>  Working shift: <b>12 hours</b> . <br>  The average salary in the workshop, not counting the owner - <b>30 000 rubles</b> (3000 yuan). <br><br>  That is, as you can see, quite normal conditions, if you do not take a twelve hour working day.  But in my opinion it is easily optimized.  At least now these 3 girls and the boy are doing the same thing in turn.  One could try to build a pipeline out of them. <br><br>  The work is simple, a great mind does not require.  With such payment, it seems to me, even in Russia, such a business can be organized. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ebd/4b1/ef1/ebd4b1ef18e6d65326c9a00dbfd49db1.jpg"><br><br>  And in the near future, read about one of the largest electronics markets in China - HuaQianBei. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/255269/">https://habr.com/ru/post/255269/</a></p>
