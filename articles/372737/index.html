In <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2592%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BA%25D1%2582%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BC%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BE%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D1%258C">victimization</a> or victimization behavior.  This is the predisposition of a person to fall into situations involving a danger to his life and health.  In particular, these are actions and actions of a person, which provoke a desire to attack him.  And may the feminists forgive me, who hate this term, but you are wrong.  In reality, female victimization behavior affects the likelihood of an attack.  Here is an interesting experiment as an example:

      <i>American professor Betty Grayson conducted a curious experiment.</i>  <i>She presented videotapes of people walking down the street to criminals sitting in different prisons and absolutely unrelated to each other.</i>  <i>These were simple passersby belonging to different social and age groups and not knowing that they were being removed.</i>  <i>That is, they behaved absolutely naturally, and the video reflected the real life scene.</i>  <i>The researchers asked the prisoners to determine which of the pictures on the tape they would have chosen as their victims.</i>  <i>Amazingly, but true: most pointed to the same people.</i>  <i>The ideal object for attack looks something like this: stooped shoulders, constrained movements, sluggish, extinct, avoiding contact gaze, bowed head, clumsy weaving gait.</i>  <i>The degree of involvement in the world around is also indicative - a person who is deep in thought and does not notice what is happening around him is easily vulnerable.</i> <br><br>  If you, my dear reader, thought that I blamed the victims of violence for what happened to them, then no, I'm not going to do this, you just need to look at the problem from different sides, and not like we love feminists, only with one and very categorical. <br><br>  It is also possible to attribute to victimization the fact that some girls, let's say, ‚Äúrun into trouble‚Äù.  Think about yourself, who has more chances to be raped, a girl who catches ‚Äúbombing‚Äù at 3 o‚Äôclock in the morning, or who calls an official taxi?  The answer is obvious, no need to go in a cage to a lion, and then wonder what he ate you. <br><br>  And now to another question, why do we blame women for this?  It is logical to assume that after such a stressful situation, they need help in every way, and we suffer from this nonsense. <br><br>  From the tendency to blame the victim of violence and rape, a hasty conclusion was made about the existence of a "culture of rape", where rape is encouraged (at least not condemned), the woman is objectified and everything is bad. <br><br>  In reality, there is no culture of rape.  There is a <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2592%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0_%25D0%25B2_%25D1%2581%25D0%25BF%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B4%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B2%25D1%258B%25D0%25B9_%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B8%25D1%2580">phenomenon of faith in a just world</a> .  People sincerely believe that the world is organized fairly and everyone gets what they deserve.  The raped are guilty because they behaved provocatively, beaten wives themselves caused aggression, the poor themselves are too lazy to work, the sick themselves caused the disease in themselves. <br><br>  Melvin Lerner and his colleagues discovered the phenomenon of faith in the just world.  He conducted many experiments and from the results of these experiments his hair naturally stands on end. <br><br>  Take at least the classic experiment with the "disgusting victim." <br><br>  <i>The essence of the experiment is simple.</i>  <i>Its participants watched the learning process (of course, rigged).</i>  <i>The ‚Äúpupil‚Äù was supposed to perform memorization tasks, and for the mistakes she was shocked with electricity (the participants thought so; in fact, they did not beat anyone, everything was ‚Äúmake-believe‚Äù).</i>  <i>Please note - the experiment participants only observed.</i>  <i>And when they were asked to rate the ‚Äúschoolgirl,‚Äù they, in theory, could feel compassion and pity the poor girl, who honestly tried to accomplish the task as best as possible, but still received painful electric shocks.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>But in practice, participants in the experiment expressed unflattering about the girl.</i>  <i>‚ÄúShe herself is to blame,‚Äù ‚Äúit was necessary to be more careful,‚Äù ‚Äúthere was nothing to take, since you cannot‚Äù, ‚Äúshe deserved it‚Äù ... Familiar words, right?</i>  <i>Observation of the victim for some reason caused not compassion, but censure.</i> <br><br>  Lerner believed that the humiliation of a defenseless victim arises because of the faith "I am a just person living in a <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2592%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0_%25D0%25B2_%25D1%2581%25D0%25BF%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B4%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B2%25D1%258B%25D0%25B9_%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B8%25D1%2580">just world</a> in which everyone gets what he deserves." <br><br>  This allows you to somewhat relieve the horror of an uncontrolled life and to bring into it at least some certainty (illusory, of course).  This is something like a magical practice - if only the bad get the bad, then if I am good, the trouble will pass by. <br><br>  And if someone has not bypassed someone with a misfortune, it means that it serves him. <br><br>  It is curious that in this case there is an important point - the observers reject and degrade the victim when they are unable to change the fate of the victim.  If they can intervene and fix something, they are often not so critical.  As you understand, in the case of a rape that happened, you cannot undo the incident.  Therefore, it is much easier to blame the sacrifice for everything in order to preserve your faith in a just world. <br><br>  Of course, the abused person also contributed to this situation.  I have already spoken about victimization behavior.  But blindly believing that he (she) got it "rightly," means not to take into account uncontrollable factors that a person cannot influence in any way.  The rapist is guilty of rape, the robber is responsible for robbery. <br><br>  In other words, if you want to blame the rape victim for ‚Äúyou should not have worn such a dress,‚Äù keep silent and think carefully about why you were going to say that.  And then, if you really can not help, just keep silent.  It will be better for everyone.  And, of course, if you can help, help.  In a word, deed - help.  Can not help - be silent. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/372737/">https://habr.com/ru/post/372737/</a></p>
