      Here is the first part, the rest will be later. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  Something about me </h4><br>  He studied in St. Petersburg, not in the latest university.  He worked a little with schoolchildren.  Now I lead, as we would say, uprats and labs in physics in one of the TOP10 universities in the world (in the USA), being a graduate student.  Looking around, I began to think about why our education is still valued and what exactly is so good about it. <br><br><h4>  What are the school tasks </h4><br><h5>  Task: ‚ÄúPassing Venus across the disk of the Sun‚Äù </h5><br>  As you know, occasionally Venus passes through the disk of the Sun.  The last such event was quite recently - June 6 of this year. <br><br>  Let's dream up what a physics problem on this topic could be.  We will move from the wording for the student with good preparation for the drop.  So. <br><br><h6>  Option A </h6><br>  <b>Estimate how often Venus passes through the disk of the Sun.</b> <b><br></b>  <b>Given: any reference data.</b> <br><br>  Laconic condition.  In this version, we assume a creative task as close as possible to research work. <br><br>  In order to reveal all the effects, the task requires several consecutive steps, each of which is quite trivial.  The task is good because you can dig deeply and qualitatively show the alternation of intervals between eclipses, and you can roughly estimate the frequency. <br><br>  <i>Brief solution:</i> <br>  1. Due to the fact that Venus and the Earth are in different planes (angle of about 3 degrees), the described event does not occur every time Venus is between the Earth and the Sun, but only when it occurs along the straight intersection of the orbit planes. <br>  2. Knowing that the last event was 06/06/2012 and noting that the ratio of the periods of the Earth and Venus is approximately 13/8, we can conclude.  that next time the planets will be in the same configuration in 8 Earth years (or in 13 years of Venus). <br>  3. Drawing attention to the fact that the ratio of the periods is still not exactly 13/8, but with a tail, one can estimate after how many years this tail will give a significant phase shift.  To do this, we must estimate the duration of the eclipse (this is done from simple geometry) and compare it with the tail.  Without making particularly accurate calculations, we can conclude that the intervals between events will alternate as follows: first, a couple of times for 8 years, then dephasing occurs and there is an interval of ~ 100 years, during which a shift equal to one phase accumulates, and then the cycle repeats. <br><br><h6>  Option B </h6><br>  <b>A) At what position of the planets (at what time of year) is the phenomenon described observed?</b> <b><br></b>  <b>B) How often do the planets return to mutual configuration, if one year on Venus is approximately equal to 8/13 Earth years?</b> <b><br></b>  <b>C) How will the answer in paragraph B change if the ratio of the periods is not exactly 8/13, but 0.61533?</b> <br><br>  There is already a hint of the course of action in the condition itself.  This can be chosen to produce a beautiful answer. <br><br><h6>  Option B </h6><br>  <b>A) The angular velocity of Venus across the sky at the time of passage between the Earth and the Sun V_v, the angular velocity of the Sun V_c, the angular size of the Sun S. Find the duration of the passage of Venus over the solar disk using formula number 352 from the recommended textbook (Piryulkin and Kovyrulkin, 2012, edition 9- enlarged).</b> <b><br></b>  <b>B) Mark in the figure where the described phenomenon takes place.</b> <br><br>  There is only required to use the formula.  To control work, this formula will have to be remembered.  Moreover, all the variable designations in the condition of the problem will coincide with those in the textbook, so that God forbid, do not confuse the student! <br><br><h6>  Option G </h6><br>  <b>The duration of the passage of Venus across the disk of the Sun:</b> <b><br></b>  <b>A) 100 years</b> <b><br></b>  <b>B) 1 year</b> <b><br></b>  <b>B) 10 hours</b> <b><br></b>  <b>D) 1 second</b> <b><br><br></b>  <b>Event frequency:</b> <b><br></b>  <b>A) 1 million years</b> <b><br></b>  <b>B) The alternation of 100 thousand years and 1 million years</b> <b><br></b>  <b>B) Alternation in 100 years and 8 years</b> <b><br></b>  <b>D) never</b> <br><br>  Option G for schoolchildren who were sitting in class and who had something settled in their heads. <br><br>  Naturally, the range of conditions from A to G is almost continuous. <br><br>  Due to the abuse of preparation for the USE, both through the fault of parents and at the initiative of schools, tasks like AB are lost completely and almost B. Q. Is it a bad thing?  I will give an example.  If I ask you how to open the brackets (a + b) * (c + d), how will you start thinking?  Our fundamental education provides that we remember the rule in the spirit: ‚Äúeach term of the first bracket must be multiplied by each term of the second bracket‚Äù.  And after you remember this rule, write the answer: a * c + a * g + b * c + b * g.  Fine.  And in the United States, the formula itself is sometimes taught, and a student‚Äôs formula bounces on the teeth without a second thought.  And if there are three terms, get out yourself. <br><br>  Do not believe?  Then tell me how the quadratic equation is solved.  The first thing that comes to mind: ‚Äúminus ba plus or minus root of ...‚Äù.  But this is not ‚Äúhow to solve‚Äù, but ‚Äúwhat roots‚Äù.  In other words, this formula we all wobbled together and, in fact, few will be able to deduce it or even just prove it.  Although her conclusion is included in the standard school course. <br><br>  I gave these examples in order to illustrate what knowledge can be.  I would divide them into brewing (C and D), understanding (B) and awareness (A).  Driving is the knowledge of a formula, understanding - the knowledge of formulas and the areas of their application, awareness - the ability to withdraw.  It turns out that the average Russian (I think) opening brackets knows at the level of awareness, and the formula for the roots of a quadratic equation is somewhere between bison and understanding.  But the opening of the brackets certainly doesn‚Äôt teach us with a top-notch. <br><br>  <b>The conclusion is the following.</b>  Two students can solve the problem of Venus and have the top five in astronomy for a quarter.  But depending on how the task was set, the value of their works may be fundamentally different.  The Ministry of Education wants to make sure that ‚Äúa student from the provinces receives the same knowledge as a student in a megacity‚Äù, and ‚Äúknowledge would be assessed by the USE test‚Äù.  Well, gentlemen ... It's like for the sake of optimizing production to make shoes of only 36th size, and everyone who has a foot more toes cut off.  Of course, I am for raising the level of education in the province, but not by lowering the arithmetic average in the country. <br><br>  I also want to ask the question - should you think people around you should be able to solve a quadratic equation?  In my opinion, this establishes the quality of life, exactly and how the ability to push out, knowledge of the countries included in the BRICS, confident possession of email and awareness of the need to cross the road only on the green light. <br><br><h4>  Illusive knowledge </h4><br>  What is bad bison?  The current ministry of education will say that they don‚Äôt need it, only one needs deep knowledge, and let the rest learn the base and that's enough.  But cramming, together with a paid education, is fraught with complete degradation.  I will explain why.  Imagine a good school teacher or elementary lecturer.  What is your impression of your subject?  Personally, I have, that I don‚Äôt know anything at all, that the object is immense and hides many unexplored whirlpools.  And it is true.  And now imagine that I pay the teacher for each lesson.  He will have to create in me the illusion that I am becoming a professional in this field not by day, but by the hour!  Moreover, this will be achieved by bison.  As a result, we will have young people inadequately evaluating their knowledge / abilities.  In my opinion, a huge number of students in the United States are subject to this phenomenon.  Yes, and we, more and more young people suffering from this disease. <br><br><h4>  Labs </h4><br>  A little about laboratory work. <br><br>  Simulate the situation.  Your friend, a school teacher in physics (say 11th grade), asked you to carry out laboratory work on measuring the acceleration of free fall <i>g</i> , since he urgently needs to take his mother to the dacha, and then the seedlings will wither.  And here you sit and think how to prepare for the lab.  You search for on the Internet manuals, invent what to say.  That it was still interesting!  In the end, you have drawn some text, prepared stopwatches, pebbles, strings, tickers ... Come to the children.  Clever pendulums swing, naive push stones from the cabinet, advanced solder the chain, cunning remove the fall on the cell.  More or less realistic? <br><br>  And now I‚Äôll tell you how I spent this laboratory at first-year uni-US students, where it costs from about $ 40,000 a year. <br><br>  It is given: an electric magnetic coil with a power supply unit, a flashing LED with a known frequency mounted on a metal rod, an advanced camera with adjustable shutter speed, a program that allows you to convert pixels into meters ... And to all this, detailed instructions on how and when to press which button. <br><br>  I will not describe the methodology, because I think it is obvious.  Below is one of the photos: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/756/27b/ab8/75627bab8d200e8d3b8a76e71e525f48.jpg"><br><br>  No statistical finding of the error was required.  They asked to build a graph in Excel speed / time, and explain why the points closer to the ground turn into dashes.  Many could not. <br><br>  End justifies the means?  Exclusively American approach.  But is it right? <br><br>  But this is still half the trouble.  With regard to laboratory work, then there is another huge mistake.  In the Russian system, it is assumed that you will be tortured until you write a report (sometimes according to GOST of the eleventh year) and you don‚Äôt orally to the teacher.  As a result, according to the laboratory, it is customary to receive credits / fails.  At my university in the USA, it is assumed that a student should receive a point for a laboratory, and then these points will determine his grade in comparison with other students.  This leads to the fact that students sometimes work separately or in groups, rarely help a neighbor, and, what is most sad, I cannot explain to them in detail their mistakes, because then everyone will get a score close to the maximum.  The only thing I could do was explain all the errors after the fact, but nobody needs it anymore. <br><br>  Again, I‚Äôll make a reservation that they also have quite adequate laboratory work that uses such equipment, which we never dreamed of.  I just chose an extreme example. <br><br>  <b>Conclusion.</b>  Ideally, the laboratory work should show where the numbers come from in the directory.  And why they are not always worth trusting.  At least that's how they taught me, and, with all that idiocy with the manuals of the 80s and the oscilloscopes who had seen Stalin, I must admit that the ideas are good.  The American laboratory work should be fun and create the impression that you are a cool geek with a bunch of devices (they measure angles not with a protractor, but with electronic protractors, of course).  Again, an illusion that is easy to believe.  I would say that the belief in favor of such a laboratory is akin to the belief in losing weight from diet coke. <br><br>  In the next post I wanted to talk about lectures and, summing up the conclusions of this post, write how I see the Soviet education system (an ardent supporter of which I am) in the format of online courses.  I hope these topics will seem interesting for you to discuss. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/146304/">https://habr.com/ru/post/146304/</a></p>
