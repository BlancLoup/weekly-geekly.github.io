This article is a free translation of the <a href="http://www.turbobytes.com/blog/introducing-turbobytes-pulse/">official news from the company's blog</a> . <br><br>  Does DNS work correctly for your domain everywhere?  Do your servers and CDNs return the correct answers?  Is the best network route to your sites and applications?  If you regularly need answers to these and other questions, then I ask under cat. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/166/e09/f8f/166e09f8fd91c12270a3f5cac9d2f9de.png"><a name="habracut"></a>  TurboBytes Pulse allows you to quickly and easily collect DNS, HTTP (S) and Traceroute responses from computers around the world.  Most of these computers are connected to the Internet through subscriber networks.  Pulse is an open source free project!

    <h4>  How does Pulse work? </h4><br>  A pulse consists of a set of test machines (we call them agents) and a command center or control center.  When a user sends a request to the control center, the latter in turn requests the agents to start the test and return the results back.  All communications between the control center and the agent are encrypted using the TLS protocol.  You can learn more about DNS, HTTP and Traceroute from our <a href="https://pulse.turbobytes.com/faq/">FAQs</a> . <br><br>  Currently, tests can only be run using the project website, but we also plan to implement an API interface that will be available to TurboBytes clients and all <a href="https://pulse.turbobytes.com/host/">hosters of Pulse agents</a> . <br><br>  We have already connected more than 20 agents, including in San Francisco, Seattle, Vancouver, New York, Manchester, Gothenburg, Utrecht, in Taipei and Sydney.  Every week we launch new agents and plan to increase their total number to 100 over the next few months.  ( <i>Note: At the time of this writing, 61 agents are running</i> ). <br><br><h4>  Why do we need Pulse? </h4><br>  Pulse is designed primarily as a service for our Multi-CDN clients: we want to give our user the opportunity to check whether a CDN works correctly everywhere.  For example: the user TurboBytes received a letter from the visitor about the inability to download the site.  And the first thought that may come to mind: maybe CDN in this country has completely ceased to service requests?  Does CDN work in other countries?  Are other files available from CDN?  Pulse allows you to quickly answer these questions and understand the behavior of a CDN. <br><br>  The secondary purpose of Pulse is internal use: as Multi-CDN providers, we need a way to check new and changed configurations globally at all points of presence of a CDN provider.  If the API of any provider informs us about the end of the download, is the download complete at all points of presence of this provider?  Our experience shows that it is better to check once again ... <br><br>  But still, why do we need our own service?  Wouldn't it be easier to integrate with existing solutions, for example, Pingdom or Catchpoint?  We were guided by two factors: <br><br><ul><li>  <b>Real conditions</b> : it makes no sense to test the availability of content from data centers, we need tests from subscriber networks of providers, from real offices and homes.  After all, there are your users. </li><li>  <b>Control</b> : we have our own requirements for the functionality of tests that we want to control. </li></ul><br><br><h4>  Future </h4><br>  Pulse is still a child, he will grow and grow over time.  And we have big plans for him. <br><br><h5>  More agents </h5><br>  Brazil, Spain, Hong Kong, Israel, South Africa.  These are just a few countries where we plan to launch new agents in the near future.  Our goal is to have at least one agent for each of the five largest Internet providers in all major countries.  In the US, we want to run several agents in each of the states. <br><br>  Do you want to have full access to all Pulse agents?  <a href="https://pulse.turbobytes.com/host/">Become a hosting agent!</a> <br><br><h5>  API </h5><br>  We always build the API first and then the user interface.  API for Pulse already exists.  We really want to give our users access to this API, but first we need to complete such mandatory things as access key management, task queues and request limits.  We expect the API to be ready for use in June.  ( <i>Note: the API is not yet complete at the time of this writing</i> ).  <b>Important</b> : API access is a service that we will make available only to TurboBytes clients and hosters of Pulse agents.  But everyone will be able to use Pulse for free via the web interface on pulse.turbobytes.com. <br><br><h5>  New features </h5><br>  We will not tell now about all the cool things that we plan to implement in Pulse.  Something related to HTTP / 2 is under development ... Stay tuned to Twitter on <a href="https://twitter.com/turbobytespulse">@TurboBytesPulse</a> . <br><br>  We would love to hear your thoughts, ideas and feedback.  You can also leave comments on <a href="http://www.turbobytes.com/blog/">our blog</a> or email us at <a href="">pulse@turbobytes.com</a> . <br><br>  PS: Personally, I really liked the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthis service.  I have already launched three agents and am looking forward to accessing the API.  If you know similar services, please leave links in the comments. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/261605/">https://habr.com/ru/post/261605/</a></p>
