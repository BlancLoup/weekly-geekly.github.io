  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Google OS Myths</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  I see not everyone understands the features and concept of Google OS.  Therefore, I decided to take responsibility and expose the popular myths that I found in your comments.  I think many will better understand what awaits us in the next few years. <br><br>  <b>- Google Chrome OS is an unnecessary Linux distribution for working with Google services.</b> <br><br>  Undoubtedly, Google OS is built on the Linux kernel and is formally a Linux distribution.  But in fact, we will see a new concept of the operating system created for software as a service.  Google OS will be very different from desktop-oriented operating systems - today's Windows, Ubuntu, Mac OS, etc. 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>
        <script>
          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      In Linux, it will be better with drivers and it will turn out to enlist support from popular IT brands.  So this distribution will have the best effect on the further development of Linux, unlike most of the really unnecessary distributions. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b>- Attempts to make software as a service were and they failed</b> <br><br>  Yes, but then there was no google.  But seriously, at that time, Microsoft reigned, crushed Netscape's monopoly and actually stopped the development of software innovation as a service for 10 years.  Naturally, Google does not repeat the mistakes of Netscape and releases its own operating system.  Without enlisting the support of a monopoly operating system and a browser from you know who. <br><br>  <b>- Chrome has 1-2% of the market without drastic improvements.</b> <br><br>  This is not a failure.  At Google, not all technologies are ready for the final assembly of the mosaic and the announcement of the final: ‚ÄúHello!‚Äù.  Plus there is Firefox with a large market share.  It is sponsored by Google, thus Firefox will support all the necessary Google technologies to start the expansion of software as a service. <br><br>  <b>- Badly when my personal documents are stored on Google servers</b> <br><br>  Yes, it is unpleasant when access to personal documents can be obtained by people servicing the server.  For companies and some people this is critical.  Google understands this, so they need to include automatic encryption on the client in their service software.  Otherwise, some customers will be lost. <br><br>  Well, suppose Google will not introduce encryption on the client.  In this case, there is a cloud of competitors, including open-source, as well as technologies like Greasemonkey.  The output will be found.  By the way, service software will push more people to encrypt data. <br><br>  <b>- Software as a service will only be on Google servers</b> <br><br>  If Google does not want to give (sell) binary software services.  And if there is a demand for such solutions, then competitors will offer you such a service.  For example, thanks to open-source, today you can run your own AppEngine no worse than that of Google (in terms of technology, not performance). <br><br>  <b>- Google will impose rules of the game</b> <br><br>  But why then lay out most of the code in open-source?  They can impose standards that everyone must adhere to.  But there is nothing wrong with that.  At the moment, their standards are innovative.  Undoubtedly, over time, there is a chance to expect from Google, something like ‚ÄúInternet Explorer 6‚Äù technologies that hinder progress.  But first, most of the technologies in open-source can be made fork.  Second, the story will repeat, but in this case, Google will be in the image of a bad guy.  At the moment, Google innovation is better than the monopoly of Microsoft.  And the best offers were not. <br><br>  <b>- And I have a bad Internet, so that the seizure of the world by the service software is canceled</b> <br><br>  I do not know about you, but in our god-forgotten Siberia there are normal anlim rates.  Enough to see the video, play games or windows update to do.  Even regional villages and villages have access to this.  Expensive of course, but tolerable.  I do not even know in what wilderness you live. <br><br>  <b>- Is there life offline?</b> <br><br>  Software as a service will work equally offline and online.  Even your <s>Internet</s> sites on VKontakte and other websites can now really work offline, without a fortune-telling browser saved the page in the cache or not.  Synchronization offline with online will happen simply and imperceptibly for you. <br><br>  <b>- DVD-R disc record or encode video?</b> <br><br>  In this regard, there are all the necessary technologies that from the browser will provide full access to the resources of your computer, without brakes.  For example, <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/google/46491/">NativeClient</a> from Google. <br><br>  <b>- Software as a service will not replace desktop software</b> <br><br>  In fact, replace and over time you will forget the dextup software as a bad dream.  How now forgotten software under Dos.  One day you will realize that you are indifferent to what operating system you have, as the bios installed on your computer is indifferent now.  And all holivars like Linux vs Windows will suddenly stop.  You will be able to access reading and processing of your data from anywhere in the world covered by the Internet and from any device.  Suffer left quite a bit, some 3-4 years. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/64525/">https://habr.com/ru/post/64525/</a></p>
