  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Caterham F1 Team & Dell @ Moscow City Racing 2013</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Imagine that you can sponsor some exciting sporting event.  World Cup Championships, for example, or synchronized swimming competitions.  It would be cool, right?  And we, by the way, also have something to brag about: Dell officially supports the Caterham Formula 1 team.  Well, and who since childhood has not dreamed of participating in races or at least sitting behind the wheel of a real car?  Moreover, the speed is not unusual for us - everyone knows how nimble Dell servers are :) <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  So, this summer, to support our almost native team could be right in Moscow at the Moscow City Racing event.  For those who have not heard of him, we will tell in two words: everyone for a few days could watch the real races, as well as demonstration and training performances, get an autograph from their favorite teams, look at the real racing cars and just have fun time with friends and family.  This year, Moscow City Racing took place from July 19 to July 21 in the very center of the city, and, admittedly, it was an exciting spectacle.  The mere appearance of steep fireballs against the background of the Kremlin evoked enthusiastic bewilderment, and one can only guess what the uninitiated people thought. <br>  Surely you ask why we began to tell you about the event, which took place in July.  Yes, we are not RIA-Novosti, but, believe me, emotions have not been erased so far - there is still a smell of burning rubber in the nose from heated tires to the limit.  For starters, we suggest watching three videos from the scene. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/qCa9hIGxrn8%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700019,15700186,15700191,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhhDxh3GRdegNJPPfYeewb0p5GQghQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

A Dell XPS 12 ultrabook was also found <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/dell/blog/181970/">there</a> . We already wrote about it, as well as about its ‚Äúbig brother‚Äù XPS 13, <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/dell/blog/177009/">here</a> and <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/dell/blog/181970/">there</a> .  But the famous half-height server rack could not be seen, but this can be understood: after all, the server rack is the holy of holies, and access by outsiders is prohibited there.  But even from all that we saw, it became clear how strongly the work of the F1 team on the track depends on modern computer equipment.  Modern technologies accompany the car in preparation for the race, and on the track. <br><br>  As you may have guessed, we not only supported ‚Äúour‚Äù team on the track, but also visited the paddock.  There you could see the car without wheels and decorative linings, see the motor and the pilot's place close. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage3/f97/0de/4fe/f970de4fe88b29c29f7bb8d689d4c7c2.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage3/981/f57/6bc/981f576bcfe87719bc41d4ae5bd25208.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage3/979/5f3/ffc/9795f3ffcf643e7b49dcb2d2e49ffb64.jpg"><br><br>  It‚Äôs a pity that they didn‚Äôt allow me to touch anything with my hands!  However, it was also interesting to consider a car - look at how the control panel looks like a racing car. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage3/fcc/f1c/9e0/fccf1c9e0564d146f417ae6b89d84484.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage3/7c9/977/5eb/7c99775ebffef8d7e5151debc5df63de.jpg"><br><br>  What is it?  Is it possible to call this the usual wheel? <br><br>  And you would have heard the roar of the engine close!  The noise that accompanies the car on the track - baby talk compared to how it sounds indoors.  Ears lays instantly. <br>  However, the track was no less interesting.  And even in spite of the fact that it was raining heavily, the audience gathered quite decently.  The cars cut circles on the highway laid out on the streets of Moscow, crazy splashes flew out from under the wheels, the pilots made just crazy turns - I must admit, the heart ekacho from time to time. <br>  The races were both in a large circle and in small so-called ‚Äúbagels‚Äù.  Who has ever seen such a sight, knows that there is a thick mist of smoke from burning rubber in the air, and it seems that some kind of tire is about to flare up. <br>  Of course, nothing of the kind happened, although there were some unpleasant incidents as well: the car of the Russian Marussia team died out right on the track.  It was very disappointing for him!  However, he returned to the system rather quickly.  Less lucky pilot Ferrari, who at high speed crashed into the fence, he almost got a wheel on the head.  Fortunately, everything worked out, the wheel flew past, and the pilot moved on to the spare car.  But the fans got the wreckage of the car - it is, as they say, dismantled for "quotes".  The lucky ones even boasted afterwards on social networks with their findings. <br><br>  In short, the holiday was a success.  Despite the rain, the obvious shoals with the organization - all this is nonsense, compared with the powerful influx of adrenaline in the blood and a fascinating spectacle of rushing past the steep cars.  We sincerely recommend that next year not to miss Moscow City Racing, you will not regret!  For our part, we promise to take care of the Caterham team even better than before. <br><br>  And a few more photos to complete the picture: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage3/f26/04d/353/f2604d353f4fe0ca3b81258323fa3f0f.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage3/584/989/21b/58498921b166fca9598bd242e702fb87.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage3/5fc/1f4/256/5fc1f4256bf0db052ff294a0eaabc69f.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage3/d83/2cd/5c0/d832cd5c0f6e0a4af097eb5fad7d33cd.jpg"><br><br>  PS <br>  If you missed our <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/dell/blog/193030/">post</a> about the Dell Solutions Forum 2013, we remind you that it will be held on October 17, 2013, on Thursday, from 09:00 to 19:00, at the Radisson SAS Slavyanskaya hotel.
