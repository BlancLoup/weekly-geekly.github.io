  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The results of the annual study StackOverflow - about technology, wages, happiness and coffee</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The largest international developer portal StackOverflow conducted an annual survey.  More than 26 thousand people from 157 countries participated.  <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/research/developer-survey-2015">The results</a> were very interesting. <br><br><h3>  Overall picture </h3><br>  The largest concentration of developers per 1000 people in Luxembourg, Iceland and Sweden.  The average age of the developer is 28.5 years and his date of birth falls on April 1986.  Women less than 6% and almost half of them began to program only in the last 2 years. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Most of all, the weaker floor rolls up its sleeves and takes on the code. How would you think where?  That's right in India.  I have already imagined a picture: early morning, the sun peeks out the window, the husband fell asleep on the keyboard, and the wife wakes up, moves it aside and continues to code for it, in time for the deadline.  Ok, let's go further. <br><br><h3>  Open source </h3><br>  Interesting and important.  More than 70% of respondents are working on open-source projects in the amount of 2 hours or more (per week).  If GitHub was created in Russia, then it would certainly stimulate to work out the obtained access to projects.  For example, a subscription for a year would cost 10 merged commits.  We have a very active citizenship.  But more and more colleagues I see on GitHub and it is very good.

    <h3>  Technology </h3><br>  JavaScript has become the absolute winner this year!  Of the interesting things, the popularity of Node.js increased by almost 50% over the year.  The number of Full-stack developers has increased by almost a third. <br><br>  Interestingly, compared to last year, the number of system administrators and developers of Enterprise systems has decreased.  This can be associated with the development of the cloud solutions market and the general trend for fragmentation of systems when narrow-profile solutions are created that can be transparently integrated with each other (JIRA, Basecamp, Slack, Zapier, AmoCRM).  With such a model, decision making takes place from the bottom up - the consumer (employee, department, department) chooses which product is convenient for him to use, and not top management, as it was before, introduces inconvenient ‚Äúall-in-one‚Äù systems.  Thus, we kill two birds with one stone - start-ups are easier to enter the market, and end-users receive a convenient product that allows them to work more efficiently and with more enthusiasm.  So back. <br><br><h3>  Salaries </h3><br>  Graduation programmers salaries (at hand, with all the bonuses): <br><ol><li>  Russia - $ 23,897 </li><li>  Ukraine - $ 26,190 </li><li>  United States - $ 89,631 </li></ol><br>  For web developers (average between javascript and ruby): <br><ol><li>  Eastern Europe - $ 26,628 </li><li>  Western Europe - $ 57,712 </li><li>  US - $ 93,129 </li></ol><br>  As a consequence (?) - Russia is ahead of the whole world in terms of the ratio between the ‚Äúlocal‚Äù salaries of programmers and those who live in Russia but work remotely.  Full-time remoteers earn 150% above the average, while (!), Those who have never worked remotely earn 25% below the average.  About remote work a little more later. <br><br>  And now I will emphasize that the level of wages of PHP-programmers continues to fall (this is especially noticeable in the market of Western Europe and the USA).  In fact, this is no reason to rejoice at those who embed WordPress, Bitrix, Drupal and Joomla.  This is a signal that more experienced developers will continue to move to higher paying positions (JavaScript, Ruby, etc.), while the concentration of Junior will increase in this segment of PHP.  As a result, the quality of PHP development will fall. <br><br>  I spoke about this trend several years ago.  But in our country the strategy ‚Äúwe now save now prevails and if we take off, we will rewrite‚Äù and ‚Äúit works - do not touch‚Äù instead of ‚Äúwe will make it so cool that it takes off‚Äù.  I remember a year ago we were discussing with a friend who flew in after training in the states and started making his startup here.  Then he, even being a non-programmer, saw this tendency and started doing everything on Node.js.  The result came out great.  In general, do cool, consider the prospect and you will succeed! <br><br>  I recommend later to get acquainted with the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OODA_loop">OODA cycle</a> (Observe, Orient, Decide, Act).  In the meantime, we continue. <br><br><h3>  Satisfaction with their work </h3><br>  The good news is that programmers are more satisfied with their work than other employees.  Moreover, programmers from Iran, the Netherlands, Norway and Israel have the most satisfaction.  If you look at the positions, then the Executive (CTO, CIO), Machine Learning and iOS Mobile Developers have the most happiness.  While the product managers are the least satisfied with the industry (I wonder why?), The BI experts (guys, and what did you lose?), Graphics developers, and back-end web developers. <br><br><h3>  Remote work </h3><br>  As I promised, we return to this topic.  The main result - the ability to work remotely in one degree or another is important for 50% of respondents.  The main conclusion is that companies that exclude the possibility of remote work reduce the pool of potential candidates by 2 times. <br><br><h3>  Coffee </h3><br>  And now the most interesting thing is about coffee among developers.  The leaders were Norway, the Netherlands and Sweden - there the programmer drinks 3 cups of coffee a day.  At the same time, the world average is 2.2 cups of coffee per day (apparently, Monday starts with a double serving). <br><br>  I was impressed by the results of the study.  And you?  I invite in the comments, exchange views and share your vision. <br><br>  Full poll results can be found <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/research/developer-survey-2015">here</a> . <br><br>  Have a good week everyone! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/255717/">https://habr.com/ru/post/255717/</a></p>
