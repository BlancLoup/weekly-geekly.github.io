  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Discount club or how to save money when buying a sofa</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  One day, when I got to a furniture store, I saw him.  It was a sofa of my dreams, and having closed my eyes one could imagine how it stands in my living room.  It would fit many friends, my cats would sleep on it ... <br>  I opened my eyes and looked at the price.  The price was amazing to say the least, and attempts to bargain with anything good did not lead. <br>  - Do you sell furniture well for such money?  The country has not yet ended the crisis. <br>  - This is a crisis in the country, but there is no crisis in our company. <br><br>  Returning home, I tried to calculate what the cost of such a product.  It turned out five times less than the price I saw in the store.  What to do, business in Russian.  I looked through the catalog with Italian furniture, where sofas cost 30% cheaper, delivered directly to the apartment, and sighed.  I didn't like anything ... <br><br>  Let's finish the lyrical introduction.  And try to see why prices are rising?  Not for objective reasons, but for human reasons. <br><a name="habracut"></a>

      Commercial Director of the company ‚Ññ1, providing services in any area, goes into a restaurant. <br>  - The menu? <br>  - Yes of course! <br>  - And what have you got? <br>  - Crisis, you know. <br>  ... <br><br>  ‚ÄúI‚Äôm completely stunned with this crisis,‚Äù the commercial director thinks, climbing up the stairs to his office, ‚Äúso there‚Äôs not enough money for lunch. <br>  And sitting in his office, he gives an indication to raise prices by 30%.  In this case, the cost of services remains the same. <br><br>  Of course, I am exaggerating, and if we consider the economic model, it turns out that a huge number of factors are involved in the process.  But the simple employee of the company really doesn‚Äôt care.  He watches the price increase day after day, and all questions from workers like him have a sigh: ‚ÄúWell, what do you want, a crisis ...‚Äù <br><br>  In Europe, things are different with the crisis, but we will not even go where we are not. <br>  Let's return to our sheep. <br><br>  Tell me, if you are an employee of a company selling ... well, for example, dried donkey's ears, which are undoubtedly an exotic product, and are much more expensive than black caviar, and the companies in which you work cost a mere penny, so you can buy a bag these delicious dried ears at cost?  Probably you can, yes. <br>  And your friend, who carries parts from Europe, and makes a 100% mark-up on them, and he is right in his own way, will he be able to adjust your brake discs at a discount? <br>  Probably can. <br><br>  That's why I came up with <a href="http://pricebreak.ru/">pricebreak.ru</a> , where we are all good friends to each other and share with all the discounts we can make on our services or products.  And if you don‚Äôt know what you can give to people - write about what you would like to buy, maybe someone wants the same, and it's time to remember the rule - wholesale is cheaper. <br><br>  The project is still damp, but every day I try to make it better.  And I think that with its help we, after a while, will be able to buy the thing we need cheaper. <br>  I will be glad to see you. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/74324/">https://habr.com/ru/post/74324/</a></p>
