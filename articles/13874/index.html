  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Monetization of bloggers will begin in 2 weeks</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The <a href="http://blogmoney.ru/">Blogmoney.ru</a> project, <a href="http://telnews.ru/news/detail.php%3FID%3D12926/">which</a> once <a href="http://telnews.ru/news/detail.php%3FID%3D12926/">caused a sensation</a> in RuNet, began to show signs of life.  Recall that 2 months ago at the address <a href="http://blogmoney.ru/">Blogmoney.ru</a> appeared a colorful "plug-teaser", containing the logos of all popular blog services and a form with which you can subscribe to the news of the project.  Yesterday was the first newsletter. <br><br>  It reported that <a href="http://blogmoney.ru/">Blogmoney.ru</a> finally launched its own <a href="http://blog.blogmoney.ru/">blog</a> , through which the project team intends to inform the public about the news of the portal.  At the moment, there is only one news, but it clearly indicates that the project is about to start soon: ‚ÄúToday we launched a blog with which we will inform everyone interested in our service about some nuances and prepare for the opening, the date of which is inexorably approaching.  On the blog will periodically appear news relating to the work of the service, announcements of functionality, innovations, various announcements, discussions and, perhaps, just reflections on various topics relating to our startup. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>  As you can see, at the moment on the blog, you can open several pages where there are approximate descriptions of the future features of the project.  On the launch day, all these pages will change, and only the blog page will remain unchanged, and on all the others completely different interesting things will appear.  Also, together with the launch of the project, a conference will be opened where you can talk about the work of the service, discuss development plans, add missing functionality and on all topics related to Blogmoney. ‚Äù

      In addition, the project has a FAQ, which explains some of the project‚Äôs subtleties: ‚ÄúThis will be a two-sided semi-automated system for two categories of users, which has no analogues in Runet.  (...) Blogmoney will be an ideal platform for companies and people who are looking for new ways to promote their products, services or websites. ‚Äù  Regarding the amount of payments to bloggers, it says: ‚ÄúIt depends only on the effort and desire, but it‚Äôs not at all difficult and very nice.  After all, every blogger will earn by doing his favorite thing. ‚Äù <br><br>  Dmitry Shatokhin, Blogmoney project manager, opened a secret for us: ‚ÄúAs for the functionality of our service, at first it will consist of two categories of users: advertisers and bloggers who will interact with each other through a convenient automatic system.  Advertisers will be able to create and plan extensive advertising campaigns on blogs at various levels, taking advantage of the opportunity to place advertising messages throughout the blogosphere, regardless of the type of blog, and bloggers will be able to choose advertisers and advertising messages relevant to their blog topic. <br><br>  It should also be noted that both small advertisers and large companies will be able to work with the service.  For example, young small companies on the same level as major market players will be able to create a stir around their new Internet project or software development for a relatively small budget.  As for the device itself, I beg you to wait for the project to start, which will take place no later than in 2-3 weeks.  At the moment we are debugging the system, removing bugs, adding minor functionality and various trivialities. ‚Äù <br><br>  Representatives of blog hosting also keep silent, wondering what really lies behind the beautiful words that promise each blogger personal mountains of gold.  Well, we hope that the situation will soon become clearer, and Blogmoney will appear before us in all its monetizing glory. <br><br>  via <a href="http://telnews.ru/event/13929">Telnews</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/13874/">https://habr.com/ru/post/13874/</a></p>
