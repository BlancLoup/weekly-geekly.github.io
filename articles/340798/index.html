We love these selections, so if you have something to tell you about cool designers (or you are a cool designer yourself), write to our editors, we‚Äôll be happy to cooperate.  We decided to distinguish two categories of work: UX and user interaction and web design. <br><br><h2>  UX and user interaction </h2><br><h3>  <a href="https://www.behance.net/gallery/55212387/Explore-the-Moon">Explore the Moon</a> from 108 Studio </h3><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://player.vimeo.com/video/227372948" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  Moscow Studio has created a website for the Museum of Moon Studies.  An extraordinary project, designed in black and white, scored more than 92 thousand views, 10 thousand likes and more than 500 comments. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://player.vimeo.com/video/227419808" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  The project is very cool thought out of the graphic component and its tone to the interface.  It turned out verified harmony, where user experience is taken into account to the smallest detail, and the graphics perfectly complements.  But the style of performance itself is beyond praise.

      Explore The Moon was done using Adobe products: Photoshop, Illustrator and After Effects, as well as using Maxon Cinema 4D. <br><br><h3>  <a href="https://www.behance.net/gallery/49283049/Blank">Blank</a> from Jaejin Bong </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/59/ee/32/59ee3273d7432569243383.gif"><br><br>  Blank is a special shopping service developed by a designer from Seoul, Korea.  The project gained more than 142 thousand views, 14 thousand likes and over a thousand comments. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://player.vimeo.com/video/214143049" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  Nontrivial idea for a shopping proposal: entering a query in square brackets.  Specially designed font and graphic effect.  At the same time for the user - easy navigation, beautiful picture, thoughtful animation, not distracting from the performance of target actions. <br><br><h3>  <a href="https://www.behance.net/gallery/52433389/Shopping-made-personal-IKEA-online-experience-concept">Shopping made personal: IKEA online experience concept</a> from Netguru Team </h3><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://player.vimeo.com/video/217212983" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  We think that few people have not seen this concept, invented by the Polish team.  Awesome concept and great performance gathered at Behance 71 thousand views, 8 thousand likes and over 300 comments. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/59/ee/18/59ee18f8cd79a824353569.gif"><br><br>  The beauty of the idea is that it takes into account the absolute user experience and the whole concept is made explicitly by Ikea fans.  In the first place is the user and his convenience.  And the whole graphic design is sharpened just for the user, and not for the sake of beauty, as often happens.  And that is one of the most important things: almost all user steps are taken into account, and the whole concept has been developed step by step.  And - correctly step by step: <br><br><ol><li>  highlighting problems; <br></li><li>  Brainstorm; <br></li><li>  user survey; <br></li><li>  finding solutions to problems; <br></li><li>  script testing; <br></li><li>  visual component. </li></ol><br>  When creating the concept, four Adobe products were used: After Effects, Premiere Pro, Photoshop, Illustrator. <br><br><h3>  <a href="https://www.behance.net/gallery/47031411/Trello-Atlassian-Redesign">Redesign Trello</a> (Atlassian) from Netguru Team </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/59/ee/1b/59ee1b5a20744047039518.png"><br><br>  The same team that made the concept for Ikea, decided to encroach on the holy of holies - Trello.  It turned out great!  At Behance, the redesign scored more than 113 thousand views, 11 thousand likes and about 500 comments. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/59/ee/18/59ee18f83062a215200718.png"><br><br>  What is a huge plus redesign?  The fact that it is more thoughtful design, execution and visualization.  The treglo in the Netguru Team variant is more like the correct task for sprints.  If you remember that initially - it was an online variation of Kanban boards.  In addition, the redesign looks clear, clean, easy and user-centric and needs oriented. <br><br><h3>  <a href="https://www.behance.net/gallery/45859207/AR-Virtual-Fitness-Coach-App-AR-">AR Virtual Fitness Coach App</a> by Daz Qu </h3><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/59/ee/31/59ee311a1e430342384802.gif"><br><br>  Chinese designer came up with a new application for training.  Beautiful, easy, convenient for any user with a bunch of features and stunning graphics.  The project scored on Behance 64 thousand views, 7300 likes and more than 300 comments. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/59/ee/31/59ee312d8c391690157534.gif"><br><br>  The concept offers an augmented reality that helps the user interact with it in terms of physical activity.  Offers training, takes into account the state of the body, calculates the optimal load. <br><br>  At the same time, there is an excellent statistic and graphical and practical component, and in addition, the user is once again put at the forefront.  Even moments are taken into account as it is convenient to use a smartphone: horizontally or vertically. <br><br>  When creating the concept was used Photoshop, Illustrator and After Effects. <br><br><h2>  Web design </h2><br><h3>  <a href="https://www.behance.net/gallery/43253181/Fivecell-Architects">Fivecell Architects</a> by Lucasz Drozdz and Sebastian Bednarek </h3><br>  The site and branding for the <a href="https://www.ccv.adobe.com/v1/player/ccv/4oj6BmR2UD4/embed%3Fbgcolor%3D191919">architectural studio</a> , which collected about 140 thousand views, 22 thousand likes and 350 comments.  The project was created using four Adobe products: Photoshop, Illustrator, Muse, Dreamweaver. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/59/ee/18/59ee18fbaaf3b137325009.gif"><br><br>  The whole branding and website are built on the wow effect and the desire to create pure minimalism based on the products of the company for which the order was made.  The designers managed to do it.  Another thing is that when you re-view the picture ceases to catch the eye and becomes completely mundane. <br><br><h3>  <a href="https://www.behance.net/gallery/32931419/Destiny-Portal">Destiny</a> by Dtail Studio </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/59/ee/18/59ee18fadf965545733047.png"><br><br>  The interface of a site of the well-known game was created by the American studio Dtail and the Russian designer representing it, Stanislav Hristov.  The project has collected more than 120 thousand views, 7 thousand likes and 450 comments. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/59/ee/19/59ee19011b4d1217316960.png"><br><br>  It may seem that the project is not something out of the ordinary.  Therefore, at Behance even caused controversy, how it was possible to do otherwise and more challenging and stunning imagination.  But, nevertheless, it is impossible to deny that the designer delightfully conveyed the style of the product and transferred it to the web, awarding modern colors and showing the depth of the design (3D effect). <br><br>  The portal was created with just one Photoshop and a variety of hand tools: Wacom Tablet, Adobe CC 2015, Apple iMac, Wacom Bamboo Tablet, Wacom Cintiq. <br><br><h3>  <a href="https://www.behance.net/gallery/32931093/Web-Design">A selection of works</a> on web design Ramotion </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/59/ee/19/59ee1903b4b29869409807.gif"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/59/ee/19/59ee1912112ed104945323.gif"><br><br>  The famous American studio from San Francisco constantly appears in the top according to Behance users.  For example, this collection gained more than 280 thousand views, 26 thousand likes and more than 655 comments. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/59/ee/34/59ee342d1f3b0059741210.gif"><br><br>  Ramotion has an indisputable authority not because it specializes in web design and graphics and loves the wow effect, but because it skillfully combines this with knowledge and research into user behavior and interests.  For this, and loved. <br><br>  Studio designers use three Adobe products: Photoshop, Illustrator, After Effects and Sketch. <br><br><h3>  <a href="https://www.behance.net/gallery/54218875/furnita-web">Furnita</a> by Cyril Kim </h3><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/59/ee/18/59ee18f6ac673236130231.png"><br><br>  The usual site of a furniture store from a Russian designer managed to get more than 50 thousand views on Behance, four thousand likes and 200 comments. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://player.vimeo.com/video/227280779" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  The whole secret is that the designer skillfully uses minimalism, giving it a clear shape and allowing the design to breathe, once again not forgetting about the user and his convenience.  The site was created using Sketch App and Principle. <br><br><h3>  <a href="https://www.behance.net/gallery/55437297/Texx-web">Texx</a> from Russian designers </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/59/ee/18/59ee18f779bf6344107654.png"><br><br>  The next project of Russian designers was created again only with the help of Sketch and Principle, scored 32 thousand views, 2200 likes and more than 150 comments. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://player.vimeo.com/video/229808867" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  The entire salt of the design is in the user's fixation with signatures, making announcements before scrolling.  A competent approach, taking into account the specifics of the customer company, and, of course, visual purity.  Everything you need in principle. <br><br><h2>  From the Editor </h2><br>  If you are a designer or designer, we invite you <a href="http://l.netology.ru/behance%3Futm_source%3Dblog%26utm_medium%3D747%26utm_campaign%3DBPR">to the Behance Portfolio Review on October 29 in Moscow</a> .
