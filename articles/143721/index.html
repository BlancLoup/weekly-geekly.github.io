  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Last honors to old projects</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Each programmer has personal projects from the category of hobby.  Over time, they lose relevance, stop working in the new environment, begin to clutter up the file system.  But to erase or lose them, however, it is a pity.  It remains to pay attention to them for the last time. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h4>  We have to bury them! </h4><br>  Six months passed after two successful projects at Arduino (decorative lighting), and the hands and the brain demanded the continuation of the mess with the soldering iron.  I held on for a long time, but eventually succumbed to the third project (a tablet reader for home alarm) and decided to use the <a href="http://www.atmel.com/devices/attiny85.aspx">ATTiny85</a> with eight legs as a microcontroller.  This chip was not in the radio shops of my city.  It was not on eBay.  I waited two months, the situation has not changed.  I launched into an adventure and started an account with an intermediary of the Taobao trading platform, but these chips were not in China either!  There were only ATTiny25v-10PU, and those at exorbitant prices. <br><br>  I searched the answer to the question ‚Äúwhy?‚Äù In various forums and found out that, firstly, DIP-cases have been steadily losing popularity for twenty years;  that now, if you really need DIP, then it will be easier and cheaper to buy <a href="http://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html%3F_nkw%3Dsoic%2520dip20">SOIC-DIP</a> adapters for <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch%3Ffeature%3Dplayer_detailpage%26v%3Db9FC9fAlfQE">SMD-microcontrollers</a> .  And, secondly, that the situation with the ATTiny deficit has tired everyone and that now STM8 is fashionable.

      An image of the dying ATMega / ATTiny platform appeared in my head.  And then I realized that I would have to bury my projects.  And I understood how. <br><br><h4>  With gold and servants </h4><br>  Why so much pathos?  Because the main idea is to dump them together with the used frameworks, libraries, development environments, diagrams and textures, with utilities and serial numbers for them, if necessary, with operating systems. <br><br>  And if the project used a version control system, then you should import into Mercurial, export to the bundle, and take it there as well.  Together with the hg distribution, of course. <br><br>  What else you need ... Screenshot of the program in life.  If there is.  Tags  Tags organized in the form of file names in the root folder: clearly and cross-platform.  And banal README, it seems. <br><br><h4>  Place under the cemetery </h4><br>  Unfortunately, Google Drive, apparently the most reliable storage available, was not suitable for my purposes.  I wanted to get rid of a local copy of old projects, I wanted to leave old files alone, save them from synchronization and touching, and separate them from living projects and documents. <br><br>  For the same reasons, I decided to refuse storage in the repositories.  Moreover, the repositories cannot be trusted; I personally watched the rise and fall of the three systems: CVS, VSS and SVN. <br><br>  Therefore - CD-R and shoebox under the bed.  When the CD-Rs die and end, I‚Äôll go to DVD-R.  When they are finished, the box will be replenished with flash drives, SD cards, and then microSD, nanoSD and picoSD. <br><br>  In addition, burning a CD-R is quite symbolic, and multisession will make them look like old European cemeteries. <br><br><h4>  From words to deeds </h4><br>  As an example, I would like to give my small JavaME project - the timer for the game " <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259A%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BD%25D1%2582%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BA%25D1%2582_%2528%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B3%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0%2529">Have a contact</a> " - for the Motorola L2 mobile phone, but I didn‚Äôt even find the source code for it, only ready-made files for installation on the phone.  There is no corresponding JDK, and there is no Motorola debugger emulator.  An example of what will happen to the project, if it is not properly buried. <br><br>  A little more lucky is the Majordomo project on Perl: ICQ-bot, keeping records of upcoming events for friends and lost relevance with the advent of Facebook and cheap Internet. <br><br>  The majordomo-dev and majordomo-production branches fall into the folder for burning.  Tags are: _bot, _icq, _internet, _perl (in alphabetical order).  The ActivePerl-5.10.1.1006-MSWin32-x86-291086.msi and the miraculously found module <a href="">OSCAR.pm</a> compiled for this version are located in the <a href="">distribution folder</a> .  As a screenshot I put the history of communication with this bot from QIP logs.  Write a couple of lines in the file README.txt.  And so, one project is ready for burial. <br><br>  Three evenings spent on organizing old projects.  Then there was the final burn.  A simple ‚ÄúMy old projects‚Äù with a marker on the disk, a paper envelope and a place in the box under the bed.  Among the audio cassettes for the ZX Spectrum. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/143721/">https://habr.com/ru/post/143721/</a></p>
