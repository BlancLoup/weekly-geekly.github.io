  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Review of the exhibition Kintex (South Korea, Seoul). Virtual reality, drones, 3D printing</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"> That ended the exhibition / conference in Seoul on the modern achievements in the field of virtual reality, 3D printing and drones.  For those who are not yet in the know - from 28 to 30 June in the Kintex exhibition complex, located near Seoul (Goyang city), the latest achievements of science and technology were shown.  Unfortunately on the Internet in Russian, these events are not much mentioned and I will try to correct this shortcoming. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/db5/f1b/2cd/db5f1b2cd71742a1b5fd94ab74048d71.jpg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  To at least roughly understand the scale of the event, here are a few facts.  Under these three events, about 17,000 square meters were allocated (this is more than 2 football fields).  As I understand it, exhibitions in this format are held for the second time.  More than 150 member firms were represented. <br><br>  In order to get to the exhibition halls themselves, located in the second building of the exhibition complex, you must use the "treadmills", and at least 5 times.  Let me remind you, the street heat is more than 30 degrees.

    <img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/79d/eb1/8a7/79deb18a721f4998a0cc81d9a7e85ae3.jpg"><br><br>  Actually, here is an approximate view of the combined VR room and RoboUniverse &amp; KDrone: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/347/344/0cd/3473440cd1a942138fafe17ef5b6fad9.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/c57/86f/591/c5786f59131840afac9fbdc069a563a6.jpg"><br><br>  Visitors to the exhibition can safely test VR, play games, ride through unrealistic landscapes of virtual worlds.  This can be compared with the country of amusement.  Only here it is free.  Moreover, there were prizes to especially zealous participants of immersion in virtuality.  For example, in the pavilion Unity issued a card in which stamps were put for trips to different sections of their pavilion.  There were 9 stamps in total.  For 3 stamps issued 3D glasses in the form of clips for a cell phone. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/2ff/707/9a9/2ff7079a98d54bb69574579a584d024f.jpg"><br><br>  For 6 stamps - charging for a phone or a T-shirt with the Unity logo, for all 9 - a mini-designer LEGO.  My strength was only enough to get a clip. <br><br>  Nobody canceled the queues, of course, but they are built extremely logically - there are small ribbon fences and no one climbs with the words "I only ask."  On average, they had to stand no more than 15 minutes for each ride. <br><br>  Here for example their version of roller coasters: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/626/fb6/3f2/626fb63f2bd9420e8f2fa777b4aa0fd2.jpg"><br><br>  It is assembled on a standard frame for auto racing, even the steering wheel and the gears are not removed, but the main result is the same.  I will say this - the chair throws in all directions, you have to hold on to the steering wheel so as not to throw it out of the trolley.  Correspondence of the vibration picture is extremely realistic, at the end of the trip you begin to believe what is happening. <br><br>  The day before, I had experienced an auto racing simulator on about the same platform.  It looks simply awesome from the outside, but as soon as you get behind the wheel, it‚Äôs immediately clear that this is a hoax.  jerks completely without reference to what is happening in the game, and yes even no control.  Real cars give better drive :) <br><br>  Here is another section.  Simulator of an eagle flying over Paris.  Wear glasses, you stand and look in different directions.  Tilt your head to the side - turn left / right. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/144/e10/4b6/144e104b6054475fa13205751b8f0831.jpg"><br><br>  You can deadly crash into an obstacle, which I did.  In fact, here from an interesting only beak, which can be seen on the site of his nose.  I‚Äôm not afraid of heights, and there wasn‚Äôt much to look at. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/893/14e/60b/89314e60b0134b46b6089491904aae41.jpg"><br><br>  Here is another entertainment - Galaxian similarity, but already in virtual reality.  Inside the game you can see something like this: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/dc3/f14/d05/dc3f14d052364d39a3d7f6a1711f2218.jpg"><br><br>  And from the outside it looks like this: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/e5b/025/f04/e5b025f0465a4510951ab0edad634d58.jpg"><br><br>  Actually extremely fun to shoot from enemies.  Inside the game you can see only the guns, there is no body.  When I realized that I could dodge the shots, it was already late and they shot me :).  This is one of the few games where there is no feeling of nausea from immersion.  Another problem was that the weapons selection menu was somewhere in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe bedside table and I simply could not see it.  Vest on the back is not just.  When the shot reaches the body, there is a perceptible vibration.  Who shot it is not clear, but it is clear that you are a corpse. <br><br>  Another Unity booth offered to play in the children's strategy.  According to the reviews of the son, too easy to play for a long time, but generally liked. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/bbe/3d1/1dc/bbe3d11dc8e0427283f5b84f97c328d3.jpg"><br><br>  A new shooting / gungrave slash was introduced. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/15e/934/15b/15e93415b90c4b5982cd394a2940c49a.jpg"><br><br>  They put them in a chair, put a helmet on, gave a joystick in their hands, and went ahead.  Management is pretty awkward.  To aim to have to rotate the head, rear view.  The camera can be rotated with the buttons on the joystick.  Enemies climb in all directions, and I often get confused in which direction the camera should be rotated.  The rest of the graphics is extremely pleasant, it is a pleasure to drench the enemies.  To run far will not give - it is rather a shooting gallery, than a runner.  At the end of the game, when the boss rolled me around, there was some feeling of nausea from the camera rotations in different directions.  My opinion - once you can run.  It seems to me that it would be much more comfortable to play without a helmet. <br><br>  As I already mentioned, the main problem of 3d glasses is nausea.  It appears in the case when the glasses are badly adjusted, or there is a discrepancy between the actions inside the virtual world and real physical laws.  It infuriates the brain and he begins to rebel.  In my case, these two factors worked both, because  because of myopia, I wear glasses and I have to put ordinary glasses in all 3d glasses.  Then I heard an advertisement from the center of the hall, that we say we promise a complete immersion in the ‚Äúother world‚Äù without a feeling of nausea.  I was interested in it and coming closer I saw such a promising stand. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/ae2/660/02c/ae266002ceec42068484ec2ccb2a3513.jpg"><br><br>  It is the turn, two simulators, two chairs to change shoes in special shoes and a lot of bags of different sizes on the floor.  Everything is done on the highest level.  Everyone is offered disposable shoe covers and face mask. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/2e7/d2f/c7d/2e7d2fc7df99405189d1e5cc1a506b35.jpg"><br><br>  In fact, the simulator is a kind of ice cup from childhood. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/70c/377/070/70c3770708834defba4b031a20372343.jpg"><br><br>  On the legs, crosses with plastic inserts, sliding on a plastic cup, do not allow a plastic ring and belt around to fall.  Apparently, it is the force of emphasis on this belt that affects the direction of movement in the game.  In the hands of a fairly standard 3d joysticks. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/dd7/9b9/8a6/dd79b98a61134b0b89111f123db31c69.jpg"><br><br>  In fact, the game is a first-person shooter where you can move in space, knocking your feet on the floor and shooting at targets.  Feelings say, an amateur.  There is no connection between leg movements and movement within the game. <br><br>  As such, Stafe did not find.  You have to constantly go forward, turn around and go forward again.  You can go back too, of course.  The feeling is that you lost your legs and you have to go with a heavy cart full of chests.  Once overclocked, stop or turn extremely hard.  The shots themselves and the targets are made on the cross.  The experiment with this simulator had to stop early.  Emetic urges began to increase with every second spent inside.  Opinion - extremely negative.  I do not recommend use, even as an attraction.  To buy for personal needs - absolutely discourage.  The technology is still extremely raw. <br><br>  By the way, the day before I visited Lotte World on the third floor in the section of virtual reality.  They offered to shoot in a shooter for quite a lot of money.  The equipment looked something like this. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/683/302/665/683302665d8e4ceab4fb98494a9c1ea8.jpg"><br><br>  What is missing is the virtual reality glasses on the face.  Glow points are position sensors in space.  In reality, these are white dots.  The camera sees them glowing.  They are used to determine your posture and transfer data to the game.  For the attraction, there are two rooms of 40 meters each.  2 players can be played at the same time.  This is a game in single player mode, where you are given the task to survive on the space base and destroy all the monsters.  It looks all very realistic.  In the game you can see your palms and automatic.  The backpack itself weighs about 3 kg, plus a 1.5 kilo pistol.  In general, a complete immersion in the role of the star infantryman.  The only disadvantage of such an attraction is a restriction on movements in space.  There are about 10 steps in each direction.  All movements are tracked in the game and the feeling that you really shy away from enemies behind the barrels are fully present.  There is no feeling of nausea or motion sickness.  At the end of the game it's a pity to leave this world.  You can only find fault with the quality of the performance of monsters.  They are not quite like the real ones yet.  Rather like the demons of the fresh thought. <br><br>  Were in this center and entertainment easier.  For example, you can jump a monkey on the vines. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/44a/22f/50d/44a22f50d48d45079c29bdbdf8469ad2.jpg"><br><br>  I have not tried it myself, but they say it is cool. <br><br>  Or you can walk along the top.  This is true for those who are afraid of heights: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/f30/6c8/142/f306c8142ab74d4dad660e884921cae1.png"><br><br>  I have not tried it myself, they say it is impressive.  Also in this center they ride a roller coaster with glasses, but I myself did not go, because  Experience has shown that such extreme entertainment for the spine is not very good. <br><br>  Let's return to the exhibition.  In general, feeling unimportant from immersion in virtuality, I decided to try out ordinary real toys, like segway. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/584/73d/c17/58473dc1711649db873d29147f2140b5.png"><br><br>  Those who know how to ride a bike or a skateboard, such a device will be easy to master.  There is an additional support near the knees, and if you spread your arms like wings, you can feel the flight better than any flight of an eagle.  Eh, if there were even bike paths in my hometown, then I probably would not have resisted and bought such a ride. <br><br>  On the way back I saw other 3d rides.  For example, sensors are put on the body, vibro covers, glasses on the head, and you start to wave your arms and legs on a real-virtual tatami, trying to defeat Bruce Lee.  I did not try it myself, but the children really liked it. <br><br>  In the drones section, a massive field was set aside for racing on drones.  The local mobile operator advertised its services to 5G communications, and hired professional dronogshchikov, who in 3d glasses through cellular communications drove their race cars around the track. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/64c/7af/211/64c7af211c7e4d46a5f685cfcfddaa8d.jpg"><br><br>  Unfortunately, I personally did not see this, but I tried to go along the track on a small drone controlled by a cell phone.  It was not easy, due to the fact that you need to look at the drone all the time, and your fingers constantly slide off from the right places on the phone screen.  Plus, it is not always visible in the distance, where this very drone looks nose.  Whether turned back to you, or sideways. <br><br>  Nearby was an arena for round drones.  There one could practice the accuracy of maneuvering. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/d8d/850/541/d8d8505418964b098dade3fb11423828.jpg"><br><br>  Drones were presented very different, but because  I didn‚Äôt study them much, here are some pictures of your favorite specimens.  As I understand it, the motto of all the creators of the drones as the Olympians "Faster, higher, stronger!". <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/c1a/26c/cfa/c1a26ccfaa2e47a49217365c983f7242.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/795/4f0/e26/7954f0e2637e4790a020e93aa7ccfd44.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/aa2/b7f/48b/aa2b7f48b0b44a439f34d4f25621974f.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/254/05f/452/25405f452e5b4987ba408035530c0676.jpg"><br><br>  And finally, from this exhibition - a personal taxi, to carry a child to kindergarten :) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/32a/974/48a/32a97448ae8c4d7080d915d81cbcc99c.jpg"><br><br>  Personally, I definitely did not get into such a booth. <br><br>  On the way to the 3d printing exhibition, I met such an Asian vlogger: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/4d3/d67/0b5/4d3d670b57a7410dafcb4f934933e9b2.jpg"><br><br>  I already met him inside the exhibition with one camera in my hand, but here he cooperated with two other friends and made an installation of the modern wizard Merlin with a staff, a talking hat and an all-seeing eye. <br><br>  It is time to attend a conference of 3d printers.  I will not describe a lot.  From the ground I noticed several trends.  Full-color printing has reached the level of HD quality.  In Korea, I have already met the services of scanning and color printing myself a loved one. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/fe4/b7b/1ba/fe4b7b1ba4aa405c91db4c8590b41eed.jpg"><br><br>  But upon closer inspection, voxels of different colors could be seen on these models.  I have already seen the full-length print: <br><br>  For example, this copy can be seen in the building of a holographic theater. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/502/46a/b36/50246ab363554beb9558d3f80c74230d.jpg"><br><br>  Here, too, on closer inspection, points are visible. <br><br>  At the exhibition, when reviewing full-color HD models, no points are visible.  It seems that this is an industrial toy. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/c34/099/437/c34099437af042fe91bf93a4824a9d94.jpg"><br><br>  Full-length printing was also present at the exhibition, but unfortunately only one type of plastic. <br><br>  One more tendency was traced - it is a layerless print.  For those who do not know - this is when the model ‚Äúby the hair‚Äù is pulled out of the bath with a solution.  From the bottom of the bath, the DLP projector shines and solidifies the solution. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/cd5/c50/492/cd5c50492edb4f038666df1a9362c1ec.jpg"><br><br>  This technology is still expensive, does not allow full color, but it is a very fast printing method and allows you to create extremely strong designs.  The usual method of layer-by-layer printing makes quite fragile structures, which under special load can be scattered into layers. <br><br>  One of the companies offered a heat resistant seal.  On the stand was a basin of boiling water, where the printed circles were bathed.  The representative of the company assured that all this is safe and drinking from mugs is safe for health. <br><br>  At the exhibition there were also a few presented firms developing software for modeling and rare specimens of metal printing. <br><br>  Basically it was clear that the competition is quite high and if you do not take into account the full color, printing metal and growing parts, most of the printers are mainly different sizes of the finished product, printing speed and equipment cost. <br><br>  Finally, a quiz.  Try to guess what wreaths are installed along the exhibition complexes. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/261/d5f/7a6/261d5f7a69be452eb4662fb313eb2161.jpg"><br><br>  We thought it was a funeral.  The translator on the phone said that the heads of large companies send such bouquets as a sign of respect :) <br><br>  On this tour came to an end.  I hope it was interesting. <br><br>  If anyone is interested, you can go to <a href="http://www.raymond.pro/raznoe/kintex-2017">my site</a> - there you will find videos and additional photos. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/370601/">https://habr.com/ru/post/370601/</a></p>
