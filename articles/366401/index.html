It becomes outdated much longer than the computer hardware itself.  This means that a mouse that was excellent three or four years ago may still be the best in its segment.  Therefore, when my previous long-lived mouse broke, I moved to the Logitech M705 - a classic in the literal sense, time-tested. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/7c7/044/0b1/7c70440b1570493fbea2ccf58d057e27.jpg"><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  I can not say that my choice is universal.  But I shoveled a lot of information and wanted to share it with you.  Moreover, usually the comments are much more interesting than the article itself, which means this is another way to get additional information.

    <h2>  <font color="¬´#6aa400¬ª">A bit of theory, or what makes a good office mouse good</font> </h2><br>  My main job is related to large amounts of text and code, long web pages of reference books, giant ‚Äúsheets‚Äù of tables in Excel and a rare need for photo processing.  Having tried a bunch of options, I brushed off almost all the game models - I don‚Äôt need the variable resolution of the sensor and the abundance of programmable buttons, and besides, I don‚Äôt play at work.  Secondly, I brushed off the options with a wired connection - the space on my desktop is too valuable to allow space for cable under it. <br><br>  As a result of further thought, the following requirements were born: <br><br>  1. The <b>mouse should be ergonomic</b> .  Statistics show that most use the right hand to work with the mouse.  This means that using a symmetrical mouse is tantamount to depriving oneself of some comfort.  When working for 7-9 hours a day, the hand should rest comfortably on the mouse. <br><br>  2. The <b>mouse should be made of quality materials</b> .  With the same 7-9 hours every day, I do not want my hand to sweat and stick.  For these reasons, the glossy surface of a rodent does not suit me. <br><br>  3. The <b>mouse should be comfortable for my grip and size of my palm</b> .  Since all people are different, then all hands will be different.  Someone has a small palm, someone like Valuev.  Moreover, many people still hold their mice in different ways.  This means that reviews on forums and reviews are not just subjective, they are also very dependent on the anatomical features of the owner. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/eff/414/fbb/eff414fbb0e248c897711a581c82c9e1.png" alt="image"><br>  <i>Illustration of the <a href="https://sohabr.net/gt/post/247942/">former</a> GK-post about the mouse Razer</i> <br><br>  Fortunately, with regard to the grip, about 80% prefer grip associated with palm rest on the mouse.  The same feature allows you to exclude small mice from the sample (lovers of the finger grip prefer compact models). <br><br>  4. The <b>mouse should be all-terrain, but I am not ready to overpay for the "ride" on the glass</b> .  As shown by the same polls, a very small percentage of users use a glass or mirror surface as a working one.  This means that overpayment for the theoretical opportunity to work at the glass table I do not need. <br><br>  5. If we are talking about polls, then about half of the users use the additional buttons "forward" and "back."  Personally, I use them in the browser, plus in Excel, I hung on them switching between sheets.  Very comfortably.  Hence the following requirement - the <b>mouse must have the necessary minimum of buttons</b> , preferably programmable. <br><br>  6. <b>The mouse should have a small dongle</b> .  In the period of the mid-arm, i.  when the old one was already dead, and the new one had not yet been chosen, I used the temporary option dragged off by the admins.  It was GENIUS Navigator 635. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c5d/42a/d22/c5d42ad224894305b4995d1db4d18f2b.jpg"><br><br>  The main disadvantage is a healthy USB-receiver the size of a full-sized flash drive.  For three weeks of use with a working laptop, I bent it at least twice, and once I almost broke it together with the port.  The need to remember that I have unnecessary crap hanging somewhere, which is easy to bend, is very, very floating. <br><br>  7. <b>The mouse should have a long and trouble-free warranty</b> .  This means that if something stops working for me, I will get a replacement without any problems. <br><br><h2>  <font color="¬´#6aa400¬ª">Selection results</font> </h2><br>  As a result of a long digging in the reviews, the formulation of requirements and the search for models that meet them, I have no other option but to choose the <a href="http://www.icover.ru/catalog/product/logitech_wireless_mouse_m705_910_001950_besprovodnaya_mysh_dark_grey/">Logitech Marathon M705</a> .  Why precisely she?  Firstly, she has very high ratings in most reviews and comparisons of mice.  For example, the domestic site <a href="http://bestmouses.ru/wirelessmousesrating/">Bestmouse.ru</a> in the ranking of the best wireless mice puts it in third place.  The first is the Logitech Performance MX, but it seemed to me more arm-length, on the second the Logitech G602 is a more expensive and frankly gaming mouse.  Interestingly, many foreign sources, including my beloved Thewirecutter.com, also <a href="http://thewirecutter.com/reviews/best-wireless-mouse/">put</a> it in the first place. <br><br>  Secondly, it almost completely meets all the formulated requests: <br><br>  - It is made under the right hand.  Ring finger and little finger are very comfortable to go to special hollows on the right side. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/93b/489/155/93b489155e5d4f3e82cdb0fbb6df562a.png"><br><br>  - She has a nice matte hard plastic on the "back", and a nice rubberized plastic on the left and right. <br><br>  - My rather average hand with an intermediate grip to fall on it is very convenient.  For interest, gave the mouse to his wife.  Her small palm with palm grip is also conveniently spread out on the back.  Conveniently, the mouse is sold in a plastic box, which allows you to put your hand on the mouse at the purchase stage. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/757/86d/c65/75786dc657c64871a4e48194fa57edd5.jpg"><br><br>  Several colleagues with palms more than mine, also comfortably settled on a mouse, and only one of them, the owner of large hands, grumbled about the inconvenience and returned to Logitech Performance MX, which he bought after Revolution MX. <br><br>  - The sensor got a little worse.  It is quite normal to slide on any surface, but loves a dark smooth mat.  On the glass does not plow.  Those.  all-terrain such, very conditional.  Plus, it has a resolution of 1000 Dpi, which calls into question the work with monitors above FullHD.  Those.  I now have two monitors (a 14 ‚Äùlaptop and a 22‚Äù FullHD monitor) and I am quite comfortable.  On the other hand, the transition to a larger resolution may increase the radius of the ‚Äúspruce‚Äù with the mouse. <br><br>  - Buttons.  Here is the most interesting.  The m705 has nine buttons: the traditional left and right buttons, the ‚Äúforward / back‚Äù buttons on the side surface, the scroll wheel rotation mode change button, the running application display button, and the wheel, which can be pressed directly, left and right.  Interesting is the chip with the inertial wheel, which is a Logitech chip.  As mentioned above, you do not have to work with sheets of text that last several dozen screens.  Simple scrolling kills a lot of time.  The M705 has a tricky button for putting the wheel into infinite scroll mode.  After pressing it, the wheel begins to rotate freely, quickly driving the contents down.  I also quickly sit down on this thing, I, a supporter of shortcuts in the same Excel, honestly do not know how to replace it. <br><br>  Plus, as already mentioned, I hung on the deviation of the wheel switching tabs in Chrome, and on the side "forward" and "back" switching sheets in Excel. <br><br>  In addition, in Windows 10 it became very convenient to switch between application windows by clicking on the "task" button.  Those.  I rarely use rarely used or unused buttons right now. <br><br>  - USB receiver, it is small and inconspicuous.  I stuck it in one of the ports and forgot about it.  Nothing sticks out, nothing breaks off. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/cfb/b82/c6b/cfbb82c6b11346d181079212dd926a57.png"><br><br>  - Warranty.  Here it is extended - as much as three years.  Knowing how no problem Logitech <a href="http://geektimes.ru/post/185790/">changes</a> its products, I am calm for three years. <br><br>  Additional chips.  Separately, you need to say about the battery.  After installing the proprietary software that allows you to fine-tune the mouse, plus reassign the functions of the buttons, the program displays a forecast for the mouse.  If you put fresh batteries, the forecast is 1093 days.  Three years!  In other words, the mouse warranty expires right along with the charge of the batteries. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/9ba/97e/ccd/9ba97eccd5bb4b05850417426bd45b34.jpg"><br><br><h2>  <font color="¬´#6aa400¬ª">disadvantages</font> </h2><br>  Judging by the forums, the mouse has five major flaws.  The first is the demands of the sensor.  He, of course, drives well, but the mouse works best on a normal dark rug with a smooth surface. <br><br>  The second - a number of users in a year or two have a double click when a button is pressed.  Since this is a warranty case, and the warranty lasts for three years, I do not pay attention to this moment.  It breaks down - they'll change it without any problems, it's Logitech.  This, by the way, is the problem with the rebound of the inertial wheel.  Due to improper balancing, a number of copies receive a bounce of the screen when stopping the wheel rotation in the ‚Äúinfinite‚Äù mode.  This is a marriage, and to him, too, as I understand, is covered by the warranty.  If the warranty ends, the buttons can be repaired by yourself - there are many instructions in the network, incl.  and video, plus the Chinese have parts.  This is another plus of the popular and long-playing models on the market. <br><br>  Third, in the M705, the sensor is shifted to the right under the ring finger.  This leads to somewhat inaccurate positioning in games.  Actually, if you look at the mouse estimates on the market, this problem is the basis for reducing the ratings. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/64c/477/717/64c47771765a433398befa4449d6625f.png"><br><br>  I specifically listened for a few days to the sensations during office work, and yet I could not catch this problem.  The cursor goes where it is needed. <br><br>  Fourth, after small mice people have complaints about the weight of the mouse.  As for me, the weight is quite comfortable.  But if this is a problem, one battery can be pulled out of the mouse and some can be lightened. <br><br>  Fifth - a number of users sometimes had problems with the loss of communication with the receiver.  As shown by the analysis of such flights on the branches of the forums, the cause may be interference from USB3.0 stuck into a nearby USB connector.  The problem occurs very rarely, mainly on laptops.  It is solved either by transferring the USB receiver to another, non-neighbor port, or by taking it out on a string. <br><br>  And the sixth, most importantly, is its price.  At the moment, due to the jump in the dollar rate, its price is about 3,000 rubles.  What is interesting, I simply could not find another comfortable, ergonomic, with the right amount of buttons and, damn, a stunning inertial wheel.  Considering that I spend most of my life at work, creaking with a watchdog toad, I still gave the money and have no regrets.  So, I sometimes cry over a credit card, but I do not regret it. <br><br><h2>  <font color="¬´#6aa400¬ª">And if the price was not a problem?</font> </h2><br>  If money is not a problem for you (I still adore this turnover), then there is simply a luxurious option in the form of the <a href="http://www.icover.ru/catalog/product/logitech_mx_master_910_004362_besprovodnaya_mysh/">Logitech MX Master</a> .  What is she good at?  First, it is such a mouse in the form of a Porsche.  She is ergonomic, comfortable, she has a great platform under the thumb.  And most importantly, instead of the side buttons, she has a second thumb wheel. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/9c1/0bb/acc/9c10bbacc1304f24a8b265e3b3f12648.jpg"><br><br>  I tried to work with it, and the wheel instead of buttons is just magical.  The colleague from whom I took it ‚Äúto try‚Äù uses it to move horizontally through the music file while mixing music.  He says that he met nothing better.  I also did not see anything better, but then the watchdog toad stood in the jay against the price of 8,000 rubles.  Plus, the impression has spoiled that it is discharged somewhere in a month.  After m705, when you forget about batteries at all, this is not very encouraging. <br><br><h2>  <font color="¬´#6aa400¬ª">And if not only for the office?</font> </h2><br>  When I got a baby, I bought a wired A4tech Noiseless Mouse home.  As the name implies, its main feature is silently pressing buttons.  Now it is not so silent, but the mouse is still comfortable and I do not want to change it.  As soon as it breaks or claps loudly, the next mouse will be a normal game.  According to the same Bestmouse.ru, the best gaming mouse they call the <a href="http://www.icover.ru/catalog/product/razer_deathadder_2013_clg_rz01_00840300_r3m1_provodnaya_mysh_black_white/">Razer DeathAdder</a> of the 2013 sample.  The mouse is really famous and very good. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f60/a63/dc7/f60a63dc7adb485c87c77b79a9e68c3a.jpg"><br><br>  But if someone asked my opinion on the most beautiful and technologically advanced mouse, I would choose Mad Catz RAT PRO X <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d81/6f0/61e/d816f061e7b7474eb9617870da55434a.jpg"><br><br>  It is not only incredibly beautiful, it has a lot of settings for changing the physical size under the arm and allows you to add / remove weights where it is needed, as it also allows you to change your sensor like a glove.  What is the trick: the mouse has so many individual settings that adjusting it once for yourself is unlikely to want to do it again.  Therefore, when upgrading, the platform with the sensor is simply changing, and the entire shed remains unchanged. <br><br>  But this, I repeat, is a mouse for professional gamers, with the professional price of 15,000 rubles.  Plus, Mad Catz products regularly come up with brand flaws with drivers.  For example, as <a href="http://www.computerra.ru/130306/kompyuternaya-myish-so-smennoy-ploshhadkoy-sensorom/">one of the users</a> writes <a href="http://www.computerra.ru/130306/kompyuternaya-myish-so-smennoy-ploshhadkoy-sensorom/">in the comments under the news about Mad Catz.</a> <br><br><blockquote>  ‚Äú... And the feeling is that mice Mad Katza make completely different teams located on different continents.  And it is clear that the ergonomics, convenience and comfort make serious people, check and verify everything to the millimeter.  Then they send the technical data to the second team, and the data get by mistake to the zoo to the monkeys.  Well, there is no other explanation why such a cool thing so fuck up programmers <br>  ... eh :( Why does not Raiser have this, why do they download the drivers themselves and don‚Äôt have to go anywhere, why the raiser has a cloud, where the profile is saved, and Mad Katz has no such thing. (But the raiser has another problem - poor design and uncomfortable ergonomics). " </blockquote><br><br>  In addition, problems with the drivers complained in <a href="http://geektimes.ru/post/243777/">this</a> GTtopike: <br><br><blockquote>  ‚Äú... I‚Äôm pretty googling and looking for a solution to the problem on the forums, I found that some still managed to start the side wheel and the normal reassignment of the keys, but I was not morally ready for such tests.  :) In principle, the mouse works almost perfectly out of the box, and the only thing that I customized for myself is its shape, otherwise it suited me "as it is." </blockquote><br><br>  In other words, everything is simple - arranges the option "out of the box", then Mad Catz would be an excellent choice.  If you need something customizable for yourself, then at the moment the best gaming mouse is Razer.  And if you need a gaming mouse, I would <a href="http://www.icover.ru/search/%3Fq%3Drazer%26c%3D55111">look</a> in this direction, well, or towards the <a href="http://www.icover.ru/search/%3Fq%3DSteelSeries%26c%3D60250">SteelSeries</a> .  Moreover, the reviews of those and others regularly appear on Geektimes. <br><br>  <b>Afterword from iCover:</b> <br>  Dear readers, we remind you that you are reading the blog of iCover, a place where you can get good advice or expertise in the world of gadgets.
