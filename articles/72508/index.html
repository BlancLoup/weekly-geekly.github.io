  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Another ray of hate</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Recently, it is popular to tell the truth about your favorite providers.  I will tell you a few words about the great Ukrainian monopolist, the operator Volya.  They started from Kiev, right now, by buying out local providers and operators, they operate in Lviv, Chernivtsi, Vinnitsa, Alchevsk, and many more. <br><br>  Represents the "Will" a lot of things and different - starting with television and ending with high-speed Internet and colocation.  Like all regular providers offers limit and unlimited packages. <br>  But with great reservations. <br><br>  On the main page of the site hang the so-called "consumption profiles".  Limited packages cost up to 150 hryvnia for the maximum amount of traffic - up to 80 gigabytes.  Declared speed - unlimited.  Unlimited packages are hidden deep inside, in the form of inconspicuous pdfs - at a price of up to 100 hryvnia for a maximum speed of 1 Mbps.  (The prices for individuals are given. For legal entities, everything is much more expensive and confusing).

      It would seem, everything is clear and precise.  But! <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The provider constantly artificially forces users to work with tariff packages.  My consumption per month, for example, is about 50 GB.  In order to provide myself with the necessary traffic, I have to either pay 150 hryvnia for an 80GB package (a smaller package offers only 30 GB for 100 hryvnia) or use unlimited for 100 hryvnia.  But, on the NL, I constantly cut traffic, artificially driving "to slow gateways."  The declared speed, up to 1 Mbit, can be obtained only at night.  From 11 pm to 10 am <br><br>  Attempts to find out and the provider in what matter stumble on the wall of debilitation "technical staff."  This is if during the day you get a call at all (ICQ and email are not fundamentally supported for regular subscribers).  Or constant beeps, or constant jingle.  Record waiting on the line - 48 minutes, until I was told: ‚ÄúHello.  We are glad.  Whats up?" <br><br>  Excerpts from conversations with tech support (which consists entirely of girls, strong blondness, to reach a more or less competent engineer, you need to spend a lot of nerve cells): <br><br>  - You have a torrent cuts everything. <br>  - It can not cut, because it is configured according to your recommendations and the speed is forcibly reduced to 32 kb / s. <br><br>  - You have updates swinging, clogging the channel. <br>  - Updates are not released every day and their weight does not amount to gigabytes, which would clog the channel.  In addition, I have disabled the automatic update of Windows. <br><br>  ‚ÄúThen you have a firewall.‚Äù <br>  - Yes, I have a firewall, but I can configure it and it is not configured to reduce speed in a strictly defined time period. <br><br>  - Then you work with "slow" sites. <br>  - In the global network of the Internet, all websites cannot be under peak load at the same time, failures can not happen all the time on trunk lines, and the same google.com does not switch to a narrow channel on a schedule. <br><br>  ‚ÄúSo you have a leech on the channel.‚Äù <br>  - Your specialists did a test a week ago - once.  For the safety of communication lines and their protection from outside interference, according to the legislation of Ukraine, the seller is responsible.  In this case, it is you - two. <br><br>  - What are you calling at all?  You scored the entire channel. <br>  - I bought unlimited Internet, with access speeds up to 1 Mbit.  Can I find out the reason that during the day the speed constantly drops to 512 kb / s, and on weekends and generally to 256 kb / s.  Are you forcibly limiting the speed or do you have old equipment and narrow channels that tritely can't let everyone miss? <br>  - Not!  You download it, go to slow sites, use antivirus ... <br><br>  It is all from the ordinary.  From the recent.  Missing the Internet.  Two days I call, on the third I dial. <br><br>  - No Internet.  The third day already. <br>  - you ... <br>  - interrupting.  I have no viruses on my machine.  I have correctly configured all applications.  I overloaded the modem.  I let the modem stupidly stand for half an hour, assuming that it was suddenly overheated by a directional beam of heat.  I do not have a banal ‚ÄúOnline‚Äù light bulb, which directly indicates a problem on the line. <br>  - (Sadly).  Address?  A. Yes.  You had a cliff there, the brigade was busy - today they will probably do it. <br>  - Thank. <br><br>  It was on Thursday.  Internet on Monday was not.  I called all day, on Tuesday I called. <br>  - I left a request to check the line, it took five days.  The Internet has not appeared.  And the problem is on the line and not on my local machine. <br>  - (Stunned) Address?  A. Yes.  The brigade was on Friday.  All repaired.  You had a break on the line leading to the house. <br>  - (B%? No. C%; No. by%; No.;%: No. !!!).  I hesitate to ask - what prevented me by repairing the line to check the availability of the Internet from subscribers? <br>  - It's all local in your apartment.  Tomorrow we will send the master to you.  When is it convenient?  From 12 to 15?  Well, the master will come at this time. <br><br>  Attempts to explain that in my home there are no individuals gnawing the cable, no one recently changed the plinth, etc., they did not take action on the all-knowing girl operator. <br><br>  Okay, take time off from work.  I am waiting.  15-00.  16-30.  17-20.  There is no one.  At 18-00 the boy came with a detector.  And let's make me move furniture away and show entry and exit points.  Half an hour went.  The bottom line is that you are fine.  I will leave an application for tomorrow, let the line on the risers check. <br><br>  It takes as a result more than a week.  Spat, wrote a letter to the director.  At the same time intimidated by a copy of the Consumer Protection Service. <br><br>  The next day, lo and behold!  There is internet.  It turns out the amplifier burned in the next doorway.  They came, checked, apologized. <br>  A simple thought crept in: ‚ÄúSo long as the authorities do not write out the magic pizdyulin, having intimidated by complaints to all the controlling bodies, will nobody begin to do anything at all?‚Äù. <br><br>  I will not even talk about trivial things like over-the-top ping (it happens 2k-2.5k before the banal Google), inexplicable packet loss and just a temporary loss of communication. <br><br>  PS In the next street actively collect a collective complaint.  Signed.  Turned out to be the 109th. <br>  PPS According to insider information, activated competitors are actively reducing the subscriber base, thereby unloading the line. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/72508/">https://habr.com/ru/post/72508/</a></p>
