As you know, shipments were suspended due to overheating problems.  I will not give any pictures of the configuration, as they were already in the article mentioned above.  The packaging was very good, the server box was packed in a bubble bag and already on top in black PVC bag.  Opening the box, I noted that the device looked very compact a little more than a credit card, not counting the height.

      And now, in anticipation, I decided to turn it on.  What was my disappointment when after turning on I heard a terrible howl of a fan.  But from my experience with servers, I assumed that after loading the noise level would decrease, but here the <b>first and not the last disappointment</b> awaited me. <br><br>  Caution traffic. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The device ships with the installed Debian system, so nothing needs to be installed to test it.  By connecting the cable to the Ethernet port, I tracked what IP address my router issued, but then a <b>second disappointment</b> awaited me.  The received IP address by the server was neither pinged, nor answered to the Telnet, SSH, WWW request.  It turned out that there are pluses.  The device is configured as a Wi-Fi Access Point.  Having used this type of connection and having received the settings via DHCP, I was able to log in via SSH. <br><br> <code>Linux sheevaplug-debian 2.6.32-00007-g56678ec #1 PREEMPT Mon Feb 8 03:49:55 PST 2010 armv5tel <br> <br> The programs included with the Debian GNU/Linux system are free software; <br> the exact distribution terms for each program are described in the <br> individual files in /usr/share/doc/*/copyright. <br> <br> Debian GNU/Linux comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY, to the extent <br> permitted by applicable law. <br> Last login: Mon Feb 1 16:42:41 2010 <br> sheevaplug-debian:~# uname -a <br> Linux sheevaplug-debian 2.6.32-00007-g56678ec #1 PREEMPT Mon Feb 8 03:49:55 PST 2010 armv5tel GNU/Linux <br> sheevaplug-debian:~# <br></code> <br><br>  That's about NAND memory: <br>  2 Gb is a SAMSUNG memory chip, and in the file system it is divided into several sections <br><br> <code>sheevaplug-debian:/sbin# df -h <br> Filesystem Size Used Avail Use% Mounted on <br> tmpfs 251M 0 251M 0% /lib/init/rw <br> udev 10M 720K 9.3M 8% /dev <br> tmpfs 251M 4.0K 251M 1% /dev/shm <br> rootfs 463M 204M 259M 45% / <br> tmpfs 251M 0 251M 0% /var/cache/apt <br></code> <br><br>  Also on the device were raised services such as MySQL, PHP, Lighttpd: <br><br> <code>sheevaplug-debian:/sbin# top | grep mysqld <br> 1533 root 40 0 2852 1300 1076 S 0.0 0.3 0:00.04 mysqld_safe <br> 1576 mysql 40 0 124m 16m 4708 S 0.0 3.3 0:02.05 mysqld <br> sheevaplug-debian:/sbin# top | grep php <br> 2000 www-data 40 0 28108 5396 3620 S 0.0 1.1 0:00.35 php-cgi <br> 2006 www-data 40 0 28108 5396 3620 S 0.0 1.1 0:00.35 php-cgi <br> 2029 www-data 40 0 28108 2192 416 S 0.0 0.4 0:00.00 php-cgi <br></code> <br><br>  According to what he saw lifted Lighttpd service, an attempt was made to connect via the web interface. <br>  The web interface is pretty simple: <br><br>  Main page of web interface <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/113/42a/dd6/11342add6af6487a4f333b18564b539e.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Wi-Fi mode change <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/dcd/f00/63f/dcdf0063f816909effa320959a723148.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  It is possible to change the DHCP server settings in the Wireless Router menu by calling the link <br>  "If you want to change the IP address range, please follow the instructions here." <br>  DHCP server settings page <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/10d/c47/f53/10dc47f53c175d05cba3db5bc753f605.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  But here I was waiting for the <b>next disappointment</b> .  After changing the addresses of the DHCP server, it would be customary to expect that the address of the device itself would change to the selected subnet, but no matter how.  I chose a new network 192.168.2.x did not find the device at 192.168.2.1 it remained at the old address 192.168.1.1. <br><br>  In the LAMP section, you can enable the default database. <br> <code>host:localhost <br> username:root <br> password:nosoup4u <br> databasename:plogger</code> <br> <br>  There is also a stream player ‚ÄúFlow Player‚Äù.  In the sections <b>Print Server</b> and <b>USB Modem - 3G Connectivity,</b> you can configure the corresponding services.  The <b>Bluetooth Device</b> section provides for setting up Bluetooth headphones for listening to music.  This device can be configured to work with Wi-Fi as a client.  To connect to any access point, it must be unprotected.  "This demo only lists the 'Unsecured' (Open Security) wireless networks.".  The menu states that ‚ÄúPlease note that after each reboot, the wireless SheevaPlug will be in AP mode,‚Äù so keep that in mind. <br><br>  To work via Ethernet, I had to conjure with a script <br>  I commented out the lines that are related in IPTABLES. <br><br>  <b>Attention!!!</b>  If you removed the ‚Äú/root/init_setup.sh‚Äù line in the /usr/rc.local file or deleted the term from the /root/init_setup.sh rm -f /etc/wlanclient.mode file, but not after reboot by disabling Cable, Hardware reboot button, it <b>does not return the</b> status of AP Mode.  For some reason, SSH stopped working, but the web continued to work. <br><br>  But what to do with the fan? <br>  I decided to lose the guarantee to find out what was wrong with him.  When I disassembled the device, my surprise was not chapel: <br><ul><li>  1. The fan is directly powered from the power supply; </li><li>  2. The absence of any radiators; </li><li>  3. The fan is installed in such a way that its useful work is possible only by 1/3, since  everything else is covered with USB connectors. </li></ul><br><br>  Opening the server, I noticed that the processor, RAM and ports, and the connectors themselves are pretty hot.  A very bad internal server design guarantees significant overheating of components and heating of a power supply unit until it dies.  As it turned out, repeated failures of this server are connected precisely with the failure of the power supply, but in fact the whole problem lies in the fact that the temperature mode of the chips leads to the drying of the electrolytic capacitor in the power supply. <br><br>  To edit the scripts I had to solder the console cable based on <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/DIY/101990/">this article</a> , but since  The FTDIChip TTL-232R_3v3 cable was used, then the following cable for the cable: <br><br> <code>Red ‚Äì 3.3v <br> Orange ‚Äì Tx <br> Yellow ‚Äì Rx <br> Black ‚Äì GND</code> <br> <br>  But contrary to this article, the cable earned after it was soldered in the following sequence: Black (GND), Orange (Tx), Yellow (Rx) starting from the JTAG connector.  If you solder the cable Red (3.3v) then the server behaves in an original way.  Without a power connection, it takes power from USB, all indicators of network connectors light up, but it did not achieve loading. <br>  To restore SSH access, I had to create keys with a command <br> <code>ssh-keygen ‚Äìt rsa <br> ssh-keygen ‚Äìt dsa</code>  <code>ssh-keygen ‚Äìt rsa <br> ssh-keygen ‚Äìt dsa</code> , and the question of creating keys must be answered / etc / ssh / ssh_host_rsa_key and / etc / ssh / ssh_host_dsa_key, respectively. <br><br>  Next, I will give you photos that speak for themselves (the internal device of the server): <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/72f/b03/6da/72fb036daa59746781d38d399a5ba63a.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/ae6/520/98a/ae652098a03efeca275e706420afa2d3.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/9aa/331/a2e/9aa331a2ee1abcba4d0929f1273a4578.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/387/646/67f/38764667f46e76627d9088f10970db11.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/614/abb/e60/614abbe606034834ac58292e73f13226.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Soldered console cable TTL-232R-3v3. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/dfd/129/543/dfd129543f28e56cdce64784cc7a26ef.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Having read a fair amount of forums, I realized that in the assembled state, the operation of this server is not possible, that only people don‚Äôt think up to cool this server (hereinafter the photos were not taken by me): <br><br>  Fastening the radiator to the factory cooling plate.
