  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How we built a payment acceptance system. Short review</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  If a client wants to part with the money in order to purchase the goods and services he likes, then probably the main task of any online store is to help him part with money quickly and not hurt right here without getting up from the chair, lovingly installed in front of the monitor. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Let them scold the Webmoney system.  Anyway, in terms of convenience, speed of reaction and ease of payment for the client there is no equal. <br>  Paypal and moneybookers do not even compare.  The reasons for the negative attitude to these electronic payment systems weight.  I think not only here.  Sad experience is available.  If there is interest in this issue, I will delve into it next time. <br>  Therefore, webmoney connected immediately.  Even those who don‚Äôt get WM wallets can buy a webmoney top up card or paymer check.  Bought, entered the code in the appropriate field-made payment.  <s>Curtain, music plays.</s> Purchase is made. <br>  Further, for the convenience and speed of processing-processing credit cards.  Here we experimented for a long time. <br>  Especially memorable widely advertised system Chronopay. <br>  That is who knows how to earn on inexperienced customers. <br><br>  You have connected, advertising has gone, money has been poured from credit cards.  Chronopay happily does not notice that part of the payments are coming from Nigeria (and the owners of the cards are respectable Americans, Englishmen, Germans).  Month 2 has passed. And here for the first time we heard the terrible word chargeback.

      The bottom line is simple.  A client comes to the bank and says what is this transaction.  I did not buy anything and, accordingly, did not pay ... What is this service ‚Äî I hear it for the first time.  And the bank request in Chronopay.  For what they shot a certain amount? <br>  We provided the service, the evidence, too.  The billing system recorded everything. <br>  And Chronopay responds with a sweet voice, we understand everything, we sympathize, we take money, and you also have a fine for ... For what? <br>  As soon as we understood that it was necessary to keep track of who paid us from which country, we created our own department for monitoring payments.  Risky payments began to return.  Chronopay rebelled.  He was not interested in working with us. <br>  In general, we received, enjoyed, counted, shed a tear. <br>  But armed with experience, wrote off losses, went further. <br><br>  We decided to try liqpay.  Surprisingly it turned out that the system is clearly undervalued. <br><br>  The most pleasant thing is that they beat off Chardbacks to the last.  If the online store has provided a service or product (and this has been proven), then further care is taken to deal with the claim. <br>  The second plus, instant withdrawal of money to a credit card or bank account.  There is no hold (this is when a processing company seems to transfer your money to your balance, but does not give it to you), there is no predatory interest. <br>  Honestly, I could not believe that everything would be so sweet.  Six months passed, while satisfied. <br>  There is a live, true, somewhat sleepy support. <br><br>  The next act was to connect ukash. <br>  This required some effort.  True, the results are not yet encouraging, despite one, but a tangible plus, in our opinion, advertising on their site. <br>  About this and much more in the next block. <br><br>  Have a nice day and less rake on the way :) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/66878/">https://habr.com/ru/post/66878/</a></p>
