The registration of UAVs will be handled by FSUE ZashchitaInfoTrans, reporting to the Ministry of Transport.  The same company has previously developed a technology to identify drones. <br><br>  The draft law on the mandatory registration of all UAVs weighing more than 250 grams was adopted at the end of 2015.  Then the document was supported by an absolute majority of deputies - 438 people.  There were neither abstentions nor those who voted against. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The bill sets out registration standards and clarifies terms such as ‚Äúunmanned aircraft‚Äù, ‚Äúunmanned aircraft system‚Äù, ‚Äúcommander of an unmanned aircraft‚Äù and ‚Äúexternal crew‚Äù.  They were introduced into the Air Code.

      The owner of the drone during registration must specify the <a href="http://regulation.gov.ru/projects">following data</a> : serial number, date of manufacture, manufacturer's name, maximum take-off weight, type and number of engines installed, their power.  You also need to enter your name, passport data, TIN, date and place of birth, location address, phone number and e-mail address, if any.  After the device is registered, it is assigned a state and registration identification mark, which must be applied to the drone.  According to the Rudrones resource, each registered UAV will receive a kind of ‚Äúlicense plate‚Äù, which includes RFID tags.  They will be mounted on the devices.  Provision is made for re-registration when the owner of the device changes, as well as in the case of UAV conversion. <br><br>  ‚ÄúAll the drones must fly based on the permission to use the airspace, and the permit is issued based on the registration number of the unmanned aircraft.  And if a large drone must be registered, then a small aircraft must be accounted for, ‚Äù <a href="https://rg.ru/2017/07/03/vladelcev-nezaregistrirovannyh-dronov-oshtrafuiut-dazhe-za-otryv-ot-zemli.html">writes</a> Rossiyskaya Gazeta with reference to the general director of the Association of Operators and Unmanned Aviation System Developers Gleb Babintsev. <br><br>  Last year, market participants opposed the introduction of accounting for drones, <a href="http://www.rbc.ru/rbcfreenews/595c7cf59a79471604fd19e4">writes</a> RBC.  So, <br>  Gleb Babintsev, general director of the Association of Operators and Developers of Unmanned Aviation Systems (ERBAS), said at the time that he considered the proposal of the transport department "incompletely impossible".  In his opinion, the registration procedure for drones only adds problems to the owners of drones, this does not affect the safety in any way.  ‚ÄúThose who need to use drones for illegal purposes will be able to do this without difficulty,‚Äù said Babintsev. <br><br>  Nevertheless, the deputies made changes to the legislation.  These amendments, in particular, provide for fines for non-compliance with the law.  So, if the drone weighing more than 250 grams.  took off without permission and registration number on the case, and it is even about a simple separation from the ground by several centimeters, the drone owner can receive a fine of 5 thousand rubles, an official - a fine of 20 thousand rubles, legal - 300 thousand rubles. <br><br>  At the same time, the requirements of the law do not apply to kites, but they are subject to small model aircraft.  The legislation provides for the possibility of shooting the ‚Äúillegal‚Äù flight of a drone by other citizens with sending this information to Rostransnadzor.  Now in Russia there are already more than 4 thousand registered UAVs, which were registered by their owners through the websites of the Federation of Aviation Model Sports and the Association of Operators and Developers of Unmanned Aviation Systems.  The head of the Rostransnadzor, Vladimir Chertok, says that the number of violations using unmanned aerial vehicles is growing in Russia.  Therefore, the department is already discussing the possibility of withdrawing or blocking the offending apparatus. <br><br><h3>  So you need to register now? </h3><br>  No, the fact is that the changes have come into force, but the draft resolution on registering drones is only being prepared for submission to the Ministry of Justice and the government. <br><br>  The Ministry of Transport <a href="https://vc.ru/n/reg-drones">told</a> vc.ru that the registration of drones will open only after the adoption of this regulatory act: ‚ÄúIt is supposed to adopt the corresponding regulatory legal act in pursuance of the federal law.  Prior to the entry into force of the designated act, no legal consequences for citizens as a result of the entry into force of this paragraph may not occur.  Moreover, in this regard, there are no grounds for the administrative and legal consequences. ‚Äù <br><br><div class="oembed"><twitter-widget class="twitter-tweet twitter-tweet-rendered" id="twitter-widget-0" style="position: absolute; visibility: hidden; display: block; transform: rotate(0deg); width: 500px; margin: 10px auto; max-width: 100%; min-width: 220px;"></twitter-widget><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" align="center" data-twitter-extracted-i1551858700643928966="true"><p lang="ru" dir="ltr">  Fulfilled the requirements of the law, which entered into force today, and registered its UAV, putting it on record <a href="https://t.co/rnaFAIZEho">pic.twitter.com/rnaFAIZEho</a> </p>  - Evgeny Kozlov (@ekozlov) <a href="https://twitter.com/ekozlov/status/882509595368968192">July 5, 2017</a> </blockquote><script async="" src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div><br>  There is another difficult point - so far the Ministry of Transport finds it difficult to tell which Internet resources will be responsible for registering drones.  As far as can be understood, the registration of the UAV on the websites of the Federation of Aviation Model Sports and the Association of Operators and Developers of Unmanned Aerial Systems does not have legal force. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/373607/">https://habr.com/ru/post/373607/</a></p>
