  <section class="page js-page"><h1>What will happen to social networks in 2008?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  2007 was a turning point for blogs and social networks - even housewives and traditional media began to talk about them.  There are already at least three networks that say they have millions of users.  However, the question arose, what next? <br><br>  Last year, the network grew rapidly on the idea: “there I was able to find my long-time acquaintance, whom I had not seen ... for twenty years.”  Each network formulated this idea as best it could: “restore the circles of your acquaintances,” “find your classmates who you haven’t seen for a long time,” “we have people in the network with whom you studied at the university,” but the essence did not change.  For a whole year, we added each other as friends and happily looked at the ever increasing number of our social circle. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  But by the end of the year, there were almost no unidentified friends, the themes: “What have you been doing these ten years that we have not seen,” have already been discussed, and the eternal Russian question has become most acute: “What to do?”. <br>  Moreover, all social networks are in fact similar to each other like twins - there are friends, there are messages, there is an opportunity to upload your photos.  In some network this is implemented a little better, in some slightly worse, but what is the difference?  What are the real benefits of these networks?

      Therefore, I believe that 2008 will be a turning point, when not the most comprehensive projects (a la Odnoklassniki or VKontakte), which in essence only replaced the old forums and chats, but networks with clearly expressed usefulness, will develop most dynamically. <br><br>  Already there are some interesting initiatives, even if they have not yet gathered a sufficient audience. <br><br>  First, <a href="http://autokadabra.ru/">Autokadabra</a> .  Who has a car, he knows that you can talk about it forever: where to go, how to hear, where to repair, what kind of gasoline to fill ... And " <a href="http://autokadabra.ru/">Avtokadabra</a> " creates a convenient platform for such conversations, and with those who have the same model as And you have.  Those.  with those who really have experience that can be shared.  Plus, this is a well thought-out game moment, with the ability to measure <s>pipi</s> ratings. <br><br>  Secondly, since we are talking about ratings, <a href="http://pro2.ru/">PRO2</a> .  Here, the value of the network is already in regional affinity, because you can simply hang around with a person from any city, but you still have to solve business issues where you work.  And when you also see who is the most authoritative in which business, then it becomes much easier to work. <br><br>  And thirdly, <a href="http://venividi.ru/">VeniVidi</a> .  After all, everyone needs rest and nothing is more conducive to good rest than sensible reviews of those who have already visited the place where you are going.  At some point, you realize that by overpaying a travel agency, it is better to prepare yourself, chat with experienced people and travel without vouchers.  <a href="http://venividi.ru/">VeniVidi gives you</a> everything you need. <br><br>  It is clear that only three services can not solve all the issues, but the trend seems to me to be traced - there will be a booming network that will bring real benefits, and not just places where “hundreds of thousands hang out”. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/18882/">https://habr.com/ru/post/18882/</a></p>
