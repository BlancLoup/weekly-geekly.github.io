  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Facebook simplifies publishing settings</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  You asked to make it clear who exactly can see your publications, and today we are launching a few changes that make it easier to control who can see your posts, photos and marks.  The main change is that now all privacy settings can be controlled directly during the publication, and not in a separate section within the settings of your profile, as it was before.  Below is a detailed description of what changes we are launching today, all changes are presented in the context of what will be displayed in your profile and what you will see when you post news on Facebook. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  In your profile </h4><br>  Your profile is your space.  You need to understand who can see the information in your profile, and you should always be able to control what information appears in your profile.  We have created new tools that allow you to control how new publications and photos are added to your profile and to those who can see information in your profile. <br><br><h5>  Settings for profile information </h5><br>  Until now: most of the privacy settings for the content in your profile were in the profile settings. <br>  Now: you can control the privacy settings for all the information in your profile, starting with information about your hometown and ending with all your photo albums.  C using the drop-down menu next to each part of your profile, you can control who will see this information. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/c1b/7ec/e19/c1b7ece19eade192980b02b2a997cb4a.png" alt="image">
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>
        <script>
          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      Taking out most of the settings directly to the profile also reduced the list of privacy settings in the profile settings.  If you want to learn more, read about profile settings: <a href="http://www.facebook.com/about/control">http://www.facebook.com/about/control</a> <br><br><h5>  Profile Mark Approval </h5><br>  Up to the present moment: the photos in which you were marked appeared in your profile immediately after you were marked on them, and you were asked to give an opportunity to affirm the marks on the photos before they appeared in the profile. <br>  Now: you can confirm or uncheck a photo before it appears on your profile. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/164/dbf/f20/164dbff20f251808309efb67e4d67ec2.png" alt="image"><br><br><h5>  Confirmation of marks </h5><br>  Up to the present moment: all who could see your publications or photos, could mark any of their friends in your publications or photos. <br>  Now: you can confirm or remove the mark that someone is trying to add to your publication or photo. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/dbb/95d/d1c/dbb95dd1c6465bafd4aa705c70f90c74.png" alt="image"><br><br><h5>  View profile on behalf of ... </h5><br>  Until now: you would like to understand how other users see your profile, but did not know where to look at it. <br>  Now: now with the help of the link ‚ÄúView profile as ...‚Äù you can understand what your profile looks like for other users. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/0dc/805/bb5/0dc805bb5def6796c8411639b60ef3b2.png" alt="image"><br><br><h4>  Settings for your news </h4><br>  In addition to profile changes, we also make changes to the publishing process.  Now you can manage the privacy settings of your news at the time of publication.  We are also expanding the functionality - now when you publish, you can mark exactly where and with whom you are. <br><br><h5>  Publish Settings </h5><br>  Until now: the privacy settings for your publications were on a separate page within the profile settings. <br>  Now: just like in the profile, all the settings are placed next to the window for status update.  Now when you post news on Facebook, you can choose who will see this news, and this information is placed next to the window for status updates.  If you decide to change the audience for your news, then you can do it in the drop-down menu next to the status window. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/e1e/b13/c64/e1eb13c64b6438b3619db9b5dc2b0bf1.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Also in this drop-down menu in the near future there will be an opportunity to publish this news for limited groups of friends: for colleagues, for members of one or another list of friends or members of any of your groups. <br>  If you are sending the news to Facebook not from the smartphone or the application you are using does not support the new features, then you can change the settings on the page with the privacy settings as part of the profile settings.  We have prepared for you a description of the new settings: <a href="http://www.facebook.com/about/sharing">http://www.facebook.com/about/sharing</a> <br><br><h5>  Changing the wording: ‚ÄúEverything‚Äù changed to ‚ÄúAvailable to all‚Äù </h5><br>  Up to the present moment: you could publish news for everyone, in this case, any Facebook user could see your publication. <br>  Now: we changed the name of this tag from ‚ÄúAll‚Äù to ‚ÄúAvailable to All‚Äù to indicate that this information will be available to all Facebook users, but this does not mean that all users will see this news. <br><br><h5>  Want to make changes after posting? </h5><br>  Until now: after you published the news, you could not change the list of those who can see it. <br>  Now: you can change your news audience after publication.  If you accidentally publish a news for everyone or decide to add someone to the list of those who can see this news, you can change it in the drop-down menu at any time. <br><br><h5>  Mark who you are with or what you want to discuss. </h5><br>  Up to the present moment: you could mark someone in your publication only if that user was your friend, you could mark the page only if you liked it.  Moreover, if you created an album with photos, then you had to add as friends all those users that you wanted to mention in this album. <br>  Now: you can bookmark any Facebook users.  If a user with whom you are not on Facebook is noted in the publication, this mark will appear in your profile only after you approve it. <br><br><h5>  Mark the place in publications </h5><br>  Until now: you have been discussing where you are or what places you recommend visiting. <br>  Now: you can add information about where you are to each of your posts.  You can indicate in which city or district of the city you are or mark a specific place in your publication, for example, a restaurant, a park, a concert hall.  You can indicate where you are to make your publication more interesting, but this is not required when publishing and you can not specify where you are. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/99d/44e/4b7/99d44e4b78db278bc0b0fd1e1525baa6.png"><br><br>  Find out more about how the ability to mark places in publications works: <a href="https://www.facebook.com/about/location">https://www.facebook.com/about/location</a> <br><br><h5>  Removing tags and / or content </h5><br>  Tagging lets you know when someone has tagged you in the news or on photos. <br>  Up to the present moment: users removed marks in posts or in publications that they did not like, so that this information was not displayed in their profile. <br>  Now: we simplify the ability to remove news and photos with marks from the profile.  When you receive a notification that you have been tagged on Facebook, you will see who has tagged you, and you will be prompted to remove the tag, send a message to the person who posted the news or tagged you and ask to remove the content.  Learn more about how profile tags work: <a href="https://www.facebook.com/about/tagging">https://www.facebook.com/about/tagging</a> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/6f5/98b/1fb/6f598b1fb41b228ec6386cfa827af258.png"><br><br>  These updates will be available within the next week.  When these updates become available, you will see an offer to go on a tour of the new features.  In the meantime, you can clarify the details of all changes by clicking on the links in this post. <br>  We hope that these innovations will make your presence on Facebook more pleasant and allow you to control the content of your profile and the audience for your news. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/126922/">https://habr.com/ru/post/126922/</a></p>
