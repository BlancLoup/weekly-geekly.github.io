All - full rights.  And some of them, probably, spoils us in the account.  What to do? <br><br>  - Maybe the logs look?  - sarcastically asked Stas.  - Logs for what? <br><br>  - For what period are you going to watch logs?  - Sergey was not embarrassed at all.  - Per month?  Year?  I remind you, the problem with the warehouse lasts for several years.

      - Oh, right ... - did not argue Stas.  - So what? <br><br>  - And the fact that we have a classic hole in the fence.  - Sergey raised his index finger significantly. <br><br>  - Mother honest ... - Stas smiled.  - A classic hole in the fence!  This is what treatise is written about the classic hole in the fence? <br><br>  - Now we will write this treatise.  Sit back <br><br>  - I have all the attention.  - nodded Stas. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  - Imagine the situation.  The plant is surrounded by a fence.  Well, from the grid, as it is called there ... From such a wire ... <br><br>  - Rabitz.  - prompted Stas. <br><br>  - Yes, probably.  And in this fence found a hole.  What to do? <br><br>  - Wait, are you fantasizing now?  - asked Stas.  - Or are you telling the real story? <br><br>  - Well, actually, real.  - Sergey frowned.  - Why? <br><br>  - Here is the programming mind.  - laughed Stas.  - No, just to tell a story, he will abstract it, summarize it and turn it into some kind of knowledge. <br><br>  - Okay.  - Sergey smiled in response.  - In short, this is my father-in-law told me.  He is the head of the plant works.  Not the point.  In general, they found a hole in the fence.  What to do with it? <br><br>  - Hmm ... Maybe pat?  - Stas has depicted sincere zeal. <br><br>  - You can patch up, only how do you know who is running through this hole?  - Sergey did not pay attention to the sarcasm of a friend.  - You will fill one hole, a new one will appear.  Only you will run and patch holes. <br><br>  - Oh, there you are about that ... - Stas confused.  - Okay, let's talk further. <br><br>  - They made an ambush.  At first they wanted to put the camera, then they thought - what for.  The event is for several days in total, then the camera will not be needed, anyway, to close the hole. <br><br>  - Ambush - this is it.  - Stas left his head.  - I watched a TV series about the police, they did it there too. <br><br>  - So here.  There, not far from this hole, there was a shed with a tool - well, there, a rake, shovels, and so on, for the guys who are engaged in cleaning the territory. <br><br>  - Cleaning the area?  At the factory?  - surprised Stas.  - I thought there only subbotnik clean territory. <br><br>  - No, my father-in-law loves order.  - Sergey smiled.  - As he became the head of the plant, such a marafet brought, a sight for sore eyes.  Everything, do not distract. <br><br>  - Okay, come on. <br><br>  - They put an ambush guard and, like, even the head of security.  That was more representative.  The instruction was: how would anyone get into the hole, catch and haul for interrogation. <br><br>  - Oh, it was in the film, like his ... "Turkish Gambit".  - Stas got in again.  - Do you remember?  There they started a rumor that there was a secret weapon in the army, and an ambush was planted.  They wanted to catch the one who climbed to watch. <br><br>  - caught? <br><br>  - No, not caught.  But they ran pretty, they got pleasure. <br><br>  - I see.  And then - caught.  - Sergey is meaningfully silent. <br><br>  - So what?  - impatiently asked Stas.  - Who are caught? <br><br>  - Dude of some kind.  It was late tonight.  Goes, presses, in the hands of the bag.  Caught, they say - let's go, dear.  Well, under the white ruchenki, as they say, in the interrogation. <br><br>  - What's in the bag? <br><br>  - You will laugh.  - said Sergey and smiled. <br><br>  - Come on, do not tomi. <br><br>  - Five air fresheners and three rolls of toilet paper.  - Sergey laughed. <br><br>  - Well your mother.  - laughed Stas.  - In the fall.  All right there a scrap, or spare parts, and that a toilet paper. <br><br>  - Well, some boots.  - through laughter said Sergey.  - I went, collected toilets, and dragged home. <br><br>  - What for him so many fresheners?  What to use instead of deodorants? <br><br>  - What for, not what for ... Shob Bulo. <br><br>  - Here's a moron ... And what's the end? <br><br>  - With what, they fired to hell with dogs.  The handyman turned out to be not a valuable employee. <br><br>  - Anyone else caught?  - Stas has already stopped laughing. <br><br>  - Yes, so, on trifles.  Before dinner, my aunt wanted to get out.  She said that the child should be taken away for training, the beginning there at 11 o'clock, and lunch at 12. The boss does not let go, so she runs through the hole so that the checkpoint is not marked. <br><br>  - Also fired? <br><br>  - No, the father-in-law said - a good aunt, has been working for a long time, he has known her for a long time, even when he worked in the shop himself.  I talked to her boss, ordered her to let go, they just moved her lunch.  Well, he takes the child away, then dines at home, and returns by 12 o'clock.  She was really glad she was. <br><br>  - and all?  Or someone else caught? <br><br>  - No longer steel, patched a hole and told the protection of the daily round of the fence to do. <br><br>  - It is clear, okay.  - Stas left.  - How can this help us?  Also arrange an ambush on accounting? <br><br>  - Well yes.  We return to our situation.  There is a hole - everyone has full rights. <br><br>  - In general, a strange hole, of course ... - Stas thought.  - Probably only here. <br><br>  - No, not only with us.  - Sergey shook his head.  - When I worked in an integrator company, I often saw it.  Especially when the office is small and there is no programmer.  They simply ask everyone to give full rights so that the work of the stake does not get up if something does not work out.  And in general, do not interrupt. <br><br>  - Ok, I'm quiet.  - Stas conciliatory raised palms. <br><br>  - Our goal is to understand who shits in accounting.  For example, changes the movement of the warehouse for the last month, or there for the last quarter.  If you just take away all the rights and put the same level of access, then we will get another scandal.  And most importantly - do not know.  Therefore, let us sit in ambush. <br><br>  - So, this is more interesting.  - I could not stand Stas.  - Come on, go on, tell me. <br><br>  - And what to tell ... - Sergei shrugged.  - It's simple.  First - you need to add the ability to change the rights on the fly.  Well, so that you can pick up in a couple of seconds, and vice versa - give.  Without restarting the program from the user. <br><br>  - Got it, it's easy. <br><br>  - Yes, easy.  Today will do.  Farther.  We make the right point, the maximum point. <br><br>  - What is it like? <br><br>  - If we are talking about a warehouse, it‚Äôs like this: we assign it individually to each warehouse and each type of operation.  They do not all do all the operations?  One makes the shipment, the other - the proceeds, and so on.  So we will provide this setting. <br><br>  ‚ÄúWhy divide by warehouse?‚Äù  - Stas frowned. <br><br>  - Then, that at them and on warehouses the responsibility shares.  - Sergey explained patiently.  - One works, for example, with shop warehouses, the other does not.  And now, while the setting is not a point, we have no idea who does what with what kind of warehouse. <br><br>  - Oh, now I see. <br>  - Well, everything.  The main thing is to be able to change on the fly.  She began to do the document, since - no rights.  She immediately complain.  If we quickly give rights, and she just finishes the document - great, there will be no scandal. <br><br>  - In, and how are we going to decide whom to give and to whom not? <br><br>  - We'll arrange a little interrogation - who is this, that is, who is, what you are doing, what for, why you, and not that pretty girl, and so on. <br><br>  - So they will start making trouble anyway.  - Stas shook his head.  - What is the meaning of something? <br><br>  - And we will do some paper, and we will sign with Kurchatov.  Type audit of access rights.  Once you mentioned the Turkish Gambit, remember there was a piece of paper?  Every subject, of any rank, is obliged to render full and unconditional assistance to the bearer of this. <br><br>  - So if there is such a piece of paper, we don‚Äôt need to fence anything.  - smiled Stas.  - Just tell them, shout, order - do like this.  You are the shipments, you are the displacements, and so on. <br><br>  - And we will get another year in which the problem of the warehouse is not solved. <br><br>  - But why?  - Stas threw up his hands. <br><br>  - Yes, because this is a typical approach of an effective manager - to get a piece of paper, a blank check, and start giving out orders to the left and to the right.  Not understanding the system, connections, processes. <br><br>  - Oh, you again about your system thinking ... - Stas sour. <br><br>  - Again, what about that? <br><br>  - Yes, so I ... <br><br>  - Why so, Stas?  What do you think, are we playing toys here? <br><br>  - No, of course.  Just somehow it ... Not really, or something.  It seems everything is clear, the theory is beautiful, but how to work is not clear. <br><br>  - The meaning is not in theory, but in its application.  - Sergey answered a little aggressively.  - Everyone knows the theory, but what's the use?  Here Kurchatov probably read system thinking, and a bunch of smart books.  Seen the same shelf with books in the hallway? <br><br>  - As if he read them all ... <br><br>  - I read everything!  You did not know that?  He constantly buys and reads all sorts of books for business.  Then he puts on the shelf for the rest to read.  I do not know if someone takes it or not, but Kurchatov himself read.  And where is he? <br><br>  - I do not know, in my office like.  Or at the airport, he seemed to be going to Germany. <br><br>  - He is not here.  Not in our office, but in the project.  Because he does not know what to do.  He knows the theory - ask him to tell, for example, about the system, he will sort it all out nicely and convincingly.  And how to apply this knowledge - does not know. <br><br>  - Why? <br><br>  - Because he is not an engineer, but a manager. <br><br>  - And what about the engineers at all? <br><br>  - Given that the study of methods and their application - the work of the engineer.  Do you understand?  Here you are learning new technologies? <br><br>  - Well ... - Stas pulled and smiled. <br><br>  - Yes, you study, I know.  When you come up with something new, there is an unusual task, or something else.  What are you doing? <br><br>  - I smoke, I read manuals, practice, articles. <br><br>  - Here!  Not just reading for academic interest, but for business!  You need to apply the method, and you learn how to do it.  You try, see what happens, change if it doesn't, and so on. <br><br>  - And they - not so what?  - surprised Stas. <br><br>  - Not so, that's the thing!  They do not intersect the flows of theory and practice, everyone lives their own lives.  Well, you know, like the teachers at the institute.  You look - it seems to know everything, electronics, for example, and if you pull it to the factory - it will sit in a puddle. <br><br>  - So it will sit down ... <br><br>  - Not all of course, there are sensible teachers, with a lot of practice, but there are also frank mediocrity.  I was taught by a teacher, with whom I did a diploma, once said such a joke: if you are not able to work, go to the teachers. <br><br>  Even one case was.  Two guys were doing a project at the factory.  We did some thing, I don‚Äôt remember exactly, well, the device is shorter, electronic, for production.  Not just designed, but assembled, applied, and quite successfully, even seemed to be patented. <br><br>  And then - a diploma defense.  And there, in the commission, here sits such a miracle teacher, the genius of electronics - looked at the circuit, on the job description, but as a psycho - this, he says, will not work!  He is shown a patent, a review from the factory - not in any!  He will not say everything!  Yes, rested, like a ram, he and other teachers, and the chairman of the commission say - strike balls, moron!  In the end, because of him, the guys got four. <br><br>  ‚ÄúHmm ...‚Äù muttered Stas thoughtfully. <br><br>  - The same with effective managers, one to one almost.  They know a lot, they can tell, they can speak at the seminar, some even work as consultants.  Any theory will be beautifully presented to you, an article will be written, and how it comes down to it - pffff. <br><br>  They can not do anything, only orders to distribute to the left and to the right.  Embed 5S!  Embed Lean!  Embed CRM!  Apply systems thinking techniques! <br><br>  Given that, in fact, they themselves are business engineers.  Well, they should be.  Business is also a system, do you understand?  What the hell difference how the system is implemented physically?  Here you write the program code, draw the forms - it turns out the system. <br><br>  The manager, when organizing, for example, a new department, is also building a system.  Well, there, I put the table, the chair, I planted the person, I set the computer, I wrote the instructions, the process, and so on.  That's it, the system! <br><br>  - Well, and what is not so?  - Stas shook his head uncomprehendingly.  - So he made the system. <br><br>  ‚ÄúHe didn‚Äôt make the system, he unfolded the box!‚Äù  - Sergey answered irritably.  - As a site builder, I do not know.  Or boxed information system.  Or a franchise business.  He does not understand how it all works.  Furychit somehow, and all.  And if you don‚Äôt fool around, you just have to shout loudly.  Or people to dismiss, even if they are not guilty of anything. <br><br>  Do you understand?  Here you made a system - informational.  You can act like a programmer from anecdotes - it works, and that's it, do not touch anything.  And then - bang!  - and stops a piece of work for you.  Well, or, performance problems begin, for example.  What are you going to do? <br><br>  - I will start debugging with measurement of performance.  - nodded Stas. <br><br>  - Yes, you will launch, find a bottleneck, and try to understand what is wrong there.  For example, you request a curve, it takes half a minute, but it should take half a second.  What are you going to do? <br><br>  - I will change it, I will do refactoring. <br><br>  - A manager noreta on him!  On request!  - aggressively said Sergey.  Stas smiled in response, and Sergey‚Äôs aggression disappeared like a hand. <br><br>  - Your mother, well, and you have analogies ... - Stas laughed. <br><br>  - The way it is!  - Sergey answered.  - Or dismiss the request.  Or another request instead.  Or tell the request that he is an asshole, does not like company, behaves disgustingly, and in general, why is he not dressed in uniform? <br><br>  - Damn, is also true.  - Stas could not stop.  - Or talk heart to heart with a request, by some method, such as Dale Carnegie. <br><br>  - Yep, exactly.  But this is only if he knows at least something.  To deliberately lie - this is already conscious. <br><br>  - Oh, yes ... <br><br>  - And he can do nothing.  More precisely - does not want.  Although all methods know if he is an effective manager.  Because two-faced, like Janus.  Or, as they say in the village, neither fish nor meat.  Either she is afraid, or she does not want to rock the boat.  Maximum - will charge someone from the subordinates, and he will glance, give his fucking advice. <br><br>  - How did Kurchatov charge you?  - Stas squinted slyly. <br><br>  - Well, yes ... - Sergey stopped himself.  - Similarly, damn it!  So he did the right thing the first time!  Do you understand?  Previously, he asked who? <br><br>  - Glavbuh, someone else ... <br><br>  - Here!  Managers again!  And they did not succeed!  And you and I are engineers, and we will succeed! <br><br>  - Well, not here, but you.  - corrected Stas. <br><br>  - Yes, do not find fault with the words.  - Sergey waved his hand.  - We are making history with you!  If it works out with a warehouse ... More precisely, when it turns out with a warehouse, Kurchatov will understand who should be entrusted with restoring order, you understand?  Who should make system changes? <br><br>  - Engineers.  - Stas nodded picturefully. <br><br>  - Engineers!  Right!  - Sergey exclaimed.  - And effective managers are just users of the system, albeit with governing powers.  Well, as customers of information system improvements.  It seems like they are the owners of their part of the program, but at the same time they cannot change anything in it.  Appeal to whom? <br><br>  - To us, programmers. <br><br>  - Yes, to us.  We make changes, they continue to use.  Why not do the same with other systems?  If they themselves cannot, cannot, do not decide, we will make changes!  We don't need authority, power, understand?  We do not take their bread, we will not ask to the heads of the warehouse when we overcome his problems.  Just repair, and leave, farther in the nose poking around. <br><br>  - It sounds tempting.  - Stas squinted like a contented cat.  - Business system change department.  And the leaders are our users.  Things are easy - to clean up the warehouse. <br><br>  - Yes, it goes without saying.  - Sergey nodded.  - Returning to our sheep.  So, you make the system quick setup of access rights.  So? <br><br>  - So. <br><br>  - And while I ... <br><br>  What is Sergei going to do now, no one found out, because the door to the office swung open, and two people entered it - accountant Dasha and storekeeper Rustam. <br><br>  - What's again?  - sighed Stas. <br><br>  - Again!  - shouted Rustam.  - Zadolbalsya already! <br><br>  - What have you got there again?  - Sergey asked puzzled. <br><br>  - Yes ... - Stas waved his hand.  - Give here your piece of paper. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/423139/">https://habr.com/ru/post/423139/</a></p>
