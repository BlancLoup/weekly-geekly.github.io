      1. <b>‚Äútpm.txt: what is overseas iron capable of?‚Äù</b> : Report on TPM and TXT technologies, hardware protection. <br>  2. <b>‚ÄúI2P and TOR: you can not execute pardon.</b>  <b>Anonymity on the Internet - illusion or reality? ‚Äù</b> : Anonymous decentralized I2P and TOR networks, their advantages and vector of attacks on them. <br>  3. <b>‚ÄúIN MESNESHIP: how safe are mesh networks?‚Äù</b> : A report on mesh networks, looks from two opposite sides. <br>  4. <b>‚ÄúHow to steal a cat via USB‚Äù</b> : interception of personal data, such as photos, videos, contacts from your smartphone using a USB protocol and ways to resist an attack. <br>  5. <b>‚ÄúA car is like a big smartphone: cyber security threats‚Äù</b> : cyber attacks on the CAN-bus of your car. <br>  6. <b>"L4"</b> : a mysterious report with a no less mysterious name! <br><br>  Under the cut - even more about the reports, contests, demonstrations and, of course, the hack quest itself! <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h4>  How will everything be </h4><br>  The event will take place on July 3 in St. Petersburg, in the bright and spacious conference hall of the Resource Center for International Activities ( <a href="http://www.imop-spbspu.ru/imop_tour/rus/IMOP_all/!nuk.html">here is a</a> link to the virtual tour, which includes a conference hall).  Guests can not only listen to the reports, but also participate in interesting contests.  For example, try yourself as a hacker in the hacker version of the escape room and get a prize for speed, ingenuity and sleight of hand.  Or help the NeoQUEST team in organizing the most genuine <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cold_boot_attack">cold-boot</a> attacks!  In addition to contests and reports, coffee breaks and chatting with colleagues are waiting for <s>everyone</s> in a pleasant atmosphere. <br><br><h4>  NeoQUEST reports </h4><br>  Guests will receive an extensive report on Intel technologies such as <a href="http://it.siteua.org/%25D0%259F%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D1%2586%25D0%25B5%25D1%2581%25D1%2581%25D0%25BE%25D1%2580%25D1%258B/30/Trusted_Execution_Technology__%25D1%2582%25D0%25B5%25D1%2585%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BB%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B3%25D0%25B8%25D1%258F_%25D0%25B4%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B3%25D0%25BE_%25D0%25B2%25D1%258B%25D0%25BF%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BB%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D1%258F_%25D0%25BE%25D1%2582_Intel">TXT</a> (Trusted Execution Technology) and <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trusted_Platform_Module">TPM</a> (Trusted Platform Module), and then immediately - to cool the hot and ready to explode from the abundance of brain difficult to understand information - we decided that after the ‚ÄúFrozen Computer‚Äù task in the online tour, such a demonstration really suggests itself!). <br><br>  The report ‚Äú <b>In intercountry: how safe are mesh networks?</b> ‚Äù <b>Will</b> be a conversation about the security mechanisms used in mesh networks, which are based on cryptographic algorithms and are aimed, first of all, at protection from an external intruder.  The speaker will tell you what opportunities an internal intruder has in such a situation, and how to implement attacks on the mesh network.  Immediately after the report, it will be demonstrated how to assemble your own mesh network from what is at hand. <br><br>  A little paranoia among listeners can be caused by the report ‚Äú <b>How to Steal a Cat via USB</b> ‚Äù, in which the speaker will talk about the dangers that all smartphone owners face when transferring data via USB.  The report will review the protocols used to synchronize smartphones with a PC, describe a possible method for intercepting data and give an example of the implementation of a software tool that allows this.  Following will be highlighted various ways to counter attacks, both from the smartphone and from the PC, as well as examples of their practical implementation. <br><br>  Believe in anonymity online?  Do you use TOR or I2P?  For you - a report about anonymous decentralized networks <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/I2P">I2P</a> and <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tor">TOR</a> , which will highlight their strengths and weaknesses, and also describe the possible vectors of attacks on them. <br><br>  The report with the strange, at first glance, the name " <b>L4</b> " will please specialists interested in modern trends in building operating systems! <br><br>  And for car owners and car enthusiasts - the story in the report ‚ÄúA <b>car is like a big smartphone: cyber security threats</b> ‚Äù about the safety of car driving; , again, driving safety.  All these systems can be subject to significant security threats, and you will learn about the sources of such threats and attack scenarios on NeoQUEST! <br><br><h4>  NeoQUEST contests </h4><br>  NeoQUEST guests can enjoy short competitions as well as all-day competitions.  Like last year, small tasks will be published every hour in NeoQUEST twitter, the answers to which will need to be sent to the specified e-mail.  The best participant on the basis of all tasks will receive a small prize.  Lovers of big prizes are waiting for competitions more difficult, there already have to show deeper hacking skills. <br><br>  There will definitely be contests on the subject of practical reports, so we advise you to listen to them carefully! <br><br><h4>  Hack quest </h4><br>  Participants of the hack quest will be separate from the spectators in a specially equipped room of the same Resource Center, where they will not be disturbed by the noise of the guests.  But from the room with the participants will be a video broadcast, from which viewers will be able to learn about who is in the lead at the moment. <br><br>  In continuation of the legend of the online tour, participants will need to stop the rocket, which they (accidentally!) And launched.  To get rid of this threat, they have to go through difficult tests (read - tasks), which will be related to the security of mobile devices and the Web, virtualization, competitive intelligence and hardware (we remember that in the past NeoQUEST liked our participants). <br><br><h4>  Summarizing </h4><br>  At the end of the day, the results will be summed up and everyone will know which of the participants will win the main prize - a trip to one of the international conferences on information security!  Prize-winners of the second and third places are also waiting for prizes! <br><br>  For those who can not visit NeoQUEST, there will be an online broadcast of the event.  A video with reports and demonstrations, as well as an analysis of the tasks of the NeoQUEST face-to-face tour, will be published on Habr√© soon after the quest is completed. <br>  Recall once again that admission is <b>free</b> !  We will be very happy to see new guests, no matter how long and how densely you are engaged in cybersecurity.  At NeoQUEST-2014, absolutely everyone will be able to learn something new!  Register on the <a href="http://neoquest.ru/participate/">site</a> and come to expand the cyber horizons of your knowledge! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/222009/">https://habr.com/ru/post/222009/</a></p>
