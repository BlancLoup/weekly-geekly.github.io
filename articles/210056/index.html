  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Once again about Intel contests. Memo to future participants</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/115/21f/150/11521f1509c2335e3af4b4581c41072a.jpg"><br>  Each year, Intel holds a fair number of different contests, both for <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/intel/blog/187756/">software developers</a> and <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/intel/blog/200336/">designers of various smart devices</a> .  There is no doubt that such events will continue.  According to the results of last year's Intel App Innovation Contest, we with <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/vikky13/" class="user_link">vikky13</a> prepared an <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/intel/blog/190734/">emotional post</a> in which we listed the typical mistakes of the participants from the position of judges.  Now, when the passions have subsided, I would like to once again return to this topic and tell almost the same thing more thoroughly and methodically.  You can take this post as a reminder for participants in any development competitions, not just Intel. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  Send required materials in the middle of the deadline. </h4>  Most development competitions are held in several stages.  The first one evaluates the idea and draft developments, then a demo and, finally, some final version.  It is very beneficial at each stage to keep within 50-70% of the time limit, and not only because then not to flog a fever.  The fact is that the majority still begin to move closer to the end, and the burden on judges then increases dramatically.  And judges are people too, and the increase in load still affects the quality of their work.  It is no longer possible to properly consider the proposed from all sides, although we are trying very hard.  By sending your work in advance, you give the expert an opportunity to appreciate it. <br><br><h4>  Do not rush to the choice of ideas </h4>  This message could well be considered banal if it were not for the terrifying number of similar ideas we saw that came to our minds in the first second after reading the first paragraph of the conditions of the competition.  If you need an app for a student - surely it will be a diary, in the category ‚Äúmedical applications‚Äù the health monitoring tool will become the undisputed leader, and so on.  This does not mean that such applications are not needed, but winning the competition with them is almost impossible, unless you come up with some kind of killer feature, which, in turn, is not born in a second.  So anyway, let your idea settle in your head, and there, you see, and the other will come, better. <br><br><h4>  Check your application with a spell checker. </h4>  I will not spread the thought on the tree, I will note only one thing: to read texts with ashipki is simply unpleasant.  In my opinion this is to some extent disrespect for the reader.  Of course, not everyone has innate literacy, but everyone is able to use the spelling checker feature found in any self-respecting text editor.  Further talk on this topic does not see the point.

    <h4>  Take seriously the presentation of your idea </h4>  Any, even the most brilliant idea will remain only a thorn in your brain, if you are not able to competently present it to others.  Do not think that a brilliant idea can be seen immediately, in whatever form it might be.  We had to see extremes of all kinds: both presentations in the form of one sentence with common places (everything else, apparently, was suggested to be thought out by ourselves), and opuses with endless subordinates, through which it is impossible to wade.  I give free advice: give read the description of your idea to someone sufficiently qualified, but not familiar with it to a third party.  It is necessary to ensure that your project is a) interested, b) is understandable.  This is the power of anyone, believe me. <br><br><h4>  Carefully review the conditions and requirements of the competition. </h4>  It is amazing how many people perceive contests as another opportunity to send their application, which has long been compiled for some occasion.  The conditions of the competition are read diagonally, for what?  Meanwhile, compliance with requirements is one of the main conditions checked by experts.  It is worth noting that in many cases a previously prepared idea can be ‚Äúturned‚Äù in the right direction, sometimes simply by adding a few phrases.  Healthy opportunism has never interfered with the developer. <br><br>  Most likely, in this post I did not say anything fundamentally new for you.  However, the next time, in preparation for participation in development competitions, simply re-read it in order not to miss any small, but important detail. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/210056/">https://habr.com/ru/post/210056/</a></p>
