  <section class="page js-page"><h1>And how are things going with ICQ at work?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  In the blog LJ user <a href="http://pashen.livejournal.com/">pashen</a> (King Pavel) found a <a href="http://pashen.livejournal.com/159568.html">wonderful post about how one of his friends was knocked out at work ICQ for what she supposedly communicates a lot in ICQ</a> .  It is clear that for those who do not share accounts for business and home communication, there can be several hundred users in one contact list with working contacts and just friends.  And we all answer, if not busy, for all questions at any time. <br><br>  Many employers turn off Aunt Asya and force her to leave;) it is motivated by the fact that workers spend too much work time on ‚Äúleft‚Äù communication.  As a rule, if an employee hangs soundly in ICQ, then he must be fought not for ‚ÄúVisevo‚Äù, but for results, and it‚Äôs necessary to start not from the employee himself, but from his boss, not mentioning the use of Internet pagers.  All managers are taught to focus on the result, and they always try to write off everything on Internet pagers, the thunderstorm in Aklahoma and the rebel Cthulhu. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>  Turning off ICQ in departments where employees have fairly free access to the Internet and the use of a pager does not interfere with maintaining network security, many managers show themselves short-sighted, depriving the most important indicators of collective employment. Why?

      I answer the question within five seconds :) I always know from the knocking of the keys and the click of the mouse what people do in the office, I don‚Äôt even need to look at their monitor to understand that one is being cut into Counter, the other is playing solitaire, the third is chatting into ace, and ‚Äúthis new one‚Äù edits the contract.  Why deprive yourself of a thermometer during illness?  Especially, it is useful when you still do not know what the body sickness of the company, and which part of it is sick. <br><br>  Based on this, the manager should: <br><ul><li>  study the behavior of users when they are busy and when frankly garbage suffers; </li><li>  it is quite possible to sit down to suffer garbage, for example, to start solitaire and study the sounds made by the mouse; </li><li>  include all sorts of irritants that distract from your work - put a coffee machine, give free smoking, allow ICQ, visit jobs, dating sites, allow writing to your blog, etc. </li></ul>  After that, look at the plan that is put to the team.  If the plan is executed, and the people continue to suffer with garbage, it means that their (plan) needs to be increased by a factor of two;) and require its implementation, each time proving (perhaps by example) that it is possible to execute the plan.  When people are evenly and fairly loaded, you yourself will hear the working sounds when you enter the room;) <br><br>  Learn working and non-working sounds - useful. <br>  By the way, are you allowed to use ICQ at work? <br><br>  Ps.  To whom it is interesting: after <a href="http://www.habrahabr.ru/blog/nashi_blogi/20559.html">discussing one of my posts on Habr√©,</a> Tatyana Vuks wrote a little on her blog about Habr√© and the discussion itself.
