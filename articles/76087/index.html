  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Vyzhmi MAXIMum from IT</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  It has long been a secret that IT departments are often perceived by company management simply as serving units, the benefits of which are only stable work of mail and office programs.  Have you ever thought that IT departments can be full-fledged participants in a company's business, capable of influencing business processes, optimizing them and reducing costs?  Of course, they thought and, perhaps, even looked for and tried to apply some solutions, because we all secretly dream that computers and IT technologies solve as many questions for us as possible, preferably in one place and without any extra effort. <br><br>  We thought, searched, tried, but each time we faced the same problem - integration.  How to integrate databases and programs of different departments, make them understand each other and function normally.  There are really many solutions, but most of them cannot solve this problem in a complex way.  There will always be some program that destroys everything and the company‚Äôs management either rejects this idea or uses solutions that are limited in functionality. <br><br>  You ask, what is all this? <a name="habracut"></a>  Here's the thing: IBM specialists were able to develop a comprehensive solution to the problem described above.  This is the IBM Maximo - All-In-One Asset and Services Management Solution, part of the ITSM product line.

      The key word for this platform is ‚Äúone‚Äù: one interface, one configuration tools, one business processes and services, one data subsystem.  Logging in via the web, individual settings for each user, without the need to know programming, data visualization, full interaction between users, great attention to security, a single data warehouse, a single solution provider, low cost - this is not a complete list of the obvious advantages of this platform. <br><br>  But storing data in one place, as well as simplicity and clarity in use and operation, is not all.  Comprehensive this solution makes the possibility of "seamless" integration of products using a single platform, i.e.  organization of uninterrupted interaction of various programs to solve specific problems. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e83/9f3/131/e839f313101d35d07aec3fa4d6b7109b.png" alt="image"><br><br>  And, finally, on the basis of this platform several products were implemented that greatly simplify and optimize work.  These are EAM (corporate asset management - with its implementation, a reduction in time and financial costs by 20-30%), ITAM (IT asset management), Service Desk (quality management of the services provided, both within the company and external - provided to other companies) . <br><br>  Thanks to Maximo, you get the opportunity to see all the assets (IT and non-IT) of the enterprise from the inside, to see how your equipment functions, the main systems, to see where and due to what you can minimize costs, which prevents an increase in profits and productivity growth. <br><br>  If we talk about the benefits for IT people, the introduction of ITAM solutions will automate support for IT resource management processes throughout their life cycle: inventory of IT resources and accounting for objects related to the company's IT departments, IT cost analysis, procurement planning and effective modernization of equipment and software, monitoring the fulfillment of technical support conditions from suppliers and many others. <br><br>  At the same time, Maximo does not require cardinal changes and business restructuring and does not replace other specialized applications that exist in the enterprise (accounting, personnel, etc.).  These applications can use the information that comes from Maximo.  The platform extends their functionality, peacefully coexisting with them and fulfilling its goal - increasing asset manageability. <br><br>  So, summing up, we note that when solving problems with the optimal organization and use of all available resources, you can turn to IBM development, namely the Maximo platform, which is able to ensure complete optimization of IT processes using Service Desk and ITAM, to maximize return on assets , reduce risks and costs, and increase service levels with EAM.  At the same time, using the platform significantly increases the so-called ‚Äúrating‚Äù of IT departments and their involvement in current business processes, which leads to the transformation of these departments into independent business units of the company.  More trust, more respect, more salary! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/76087/">https://habr.com/ru/post/76087/</a></p>
