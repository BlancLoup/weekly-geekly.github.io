At the same time, the company claims that it is no longer responsible for the quality of services and the safety of passengers.  Taking into account all the amendments, the new Uber agreement directly contradicts the Constitution of the Russian Federation. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  The company has described the features of working with private clients, in which it mentions that it is not a carrier and does not bear any responsibility for transportation.  Moreover, Uber disclaims responsibility for any "indirect, incidental, unforeseen, actual, punitive or consequential damages, lost data, personal injury or material damage, any loss, liability or damage."  All signatories to the agreement also acknowledge that they can use transport service providers without a formal license.  According to the new rules, the claims of users to Uber cannot exceed 500 euros for all items of damage or any other damages.

    <blockquote>  ‚ÄúThe company has new services - for example, UberEATS (food delivery) and UberRUSH (delivery of goods from stores), so Uber needed to‚Äú state the terms of responsibility ‚Äùto users.  ‚ÄúThere are no fundamental changes in the rules‚Äù, ‚Äù <a href="http://www.rbc.ru/technology_and_media/09/02/2016/56b9c85a9a7947751abc12a0">said</a> Uber's representative in Russia, Evgenia Shipova, for the RBC publication. </blockquote><br><br>  The competing services in the form of Gett, Yandex.Taxi and others have similar provisions in the contract, but unlike Uber, they work with licensed carriers.  In this case, customers still have the opportunity to file a lawsuit against them in the event of any problems. <br><br>  Quite recently, it was precisely because of this point that disagreements arose between the Moscow government and Uber - Maxim Liskutov, head of the metropolitan transportation department, announced a possible <a href="https://megamozg.ru/post/23802/">ban on Uber</a> .  So far, the management of Uber has not provided an unequivocal answer to the proposal to amend the agreement and limit work to only licensed drivers.  The companies were given a few more weeks to consider this proposal, and subsequently they could file a lawsuit against Uber demanding to ban service in Moscow.  As a result of considering a possible agreement, the tension between the company and the authorities of the capital has slightly decreased. <br><br>  A similar attitude towards Uber is emerging in some other countries.  For example, in France, local taxi drivers staged a strike, during which they blocked the traffic and staged a pogrom of Uber drivers' cars.  Now, Uber has <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-02-09/uber-suspends-french-service-to-protest-government-decisions">suspended the work of the</a> application in France from 11 am Tuesday to 3 am this Wednesday in protest against government decisions on the service in the country. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/298572/">https://habr.com/ru/post/298572/</a></p>
