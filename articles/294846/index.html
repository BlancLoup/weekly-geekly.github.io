Once or twice a month, the company organizes professional meetings for the presentation of its company's services, product testing and exchange of experience. <br><br>  Often, such events are held in the form of open networks: free participation, food and drinks for all comers.  Starting from 5-10 first customers, some companies reach up to 100+ participants at each meeting.  And, enough to promote their community, the organizers begin to monetize the network.

      So how can themed events help your business? <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  1) New customers.  There is a little chance that people will buy your product if they were present at its presentation and met with representatives of this company; <br><br>  2) Testing new services and products.  At an event, you can always ask participants to take the first test and express their opinion about it.  They will ask questions, make assumptions about convenience and improvement, and determine if the product needs to be refined before being released to the market. <br><br>  3) Advertising.  By offering a discount or temporary free use of the product to participants who attend the event, you will encourage them to tell about you to their friends and colleagues, which in the end may lead to new customers and users. <br><br>  4) Exchange of experience.  Of course, such events will attract professionals from your field who, while talking over a cup of coffee, can give you practical advice; <br><br>  5) Partnership.  At your meetings, you will be able to meet with representatives of another company that can advantageously complement your product or service.  By creating an affiliate network, you will successfully compete in the market. <br><br>  6) Monetization of events.  Ultimately, when your meetings become popular, you can always start selling tickets to them, making an extra come for your company; <br><br>  At the moment, the niche of professional events is not yet filled.  But every day more and more companies are starting to organize their meetings. <br><br>  What do you think about this?  Do you have your own events? </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/294846/">https://habr.com/ru/post/294846/</a></p>
