  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Reinvent the wheel ...</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  I have always been inclined to believe that reinventing the wheel again is not so bad.  Those.  I always, when doing a project, I write all php \ perl \ c code myself, I write all js code myself, without using frameworks and so on.  Maybe this is my minus, maybe it's stupid and the project with me at the helm will take more time.  However, I believe that such a project would be at least more unique and more suitable for this task than any other project, even with minimal use of ready-made solutions.  I have not tried to prove to anybody for a long time that this is good and cool, because I am already tired of confronting misunderstanding.  People in our age value their time and money more than the quality of their products.  Perhaps this is correct, in terms of self-enrichment, but not self-development.  How can you understand the problem from all sides, if you stupidly solve the problem with a ready-made solution? <br>  Maybe I'm too drunk now to come up with good examples =))) however.  Remember all the <a href="http://nnmtube.nnm.ru/lekciya_ob_alkogolizme">recent video</a> about alcoholism?  Class, right?  Did you notice that the author owns all the information about this topic, that he, as I like to say, ‚Äúknows the problem from all its sides, can twist it in his hands the way he needs‚Äù?  We note that he almost immediately says ‚Äúif you look at the process under a microscope,‚Äù he was on a factory tour of the production of sparkling wines and so on.  This is a person who not only read in the textbooks ‚Äúsuch and such bacteria process glucose, sucrose, etc. on c2h5oh‚Äù, this is a person who observed this process under a microscope, he saw these very bacteria with ‚Äúeyes‚Äù (in fact, the nucleus as much as I remember), with his mouth (antennae / flagella), he was on excursions and so forth.  Could it be in so much detail, and most importantly is available, would he tell all this without knowing the problem from all sides?  doubt it.  And now the question.  Can this person, with his knowledge of the topic, optimize it?  Yes! <br>  Returning to his sheep, ask yourself a question.  Can we, knowing everything about a bicycle (why the wheels should be round, what should their diameter be, how long should the handlebars be, what shape should it have and does it affect controllability, etc.), make an optimal bike for a specific purpose?  Will we be able to ‚Äúinvent‚Äù a bicycle for our specific task? <br>  Those who answer "no, do not reinvent the bicycle", let them try to make a "Bunny Hop" on a circus three-wheeled bicycle or go down the mountain on the "Stork". <br>  Probably all ... <br>  PS People, do not be lazy, study your problems.  Especially if you are young and not experienced. </div>
