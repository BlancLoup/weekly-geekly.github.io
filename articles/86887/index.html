Hacker's Notes Part 2 of 5</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  In the last issue, I told the <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/infosecurity/86880/">story of the failure of the championship in the computer club</a> , from there you can also draw my motives and information about the real sources of these stories. <br>  So, we will not repeat, and I immediately turn to the second ballad from the cycle, about Sunrise hypermarket. <br><br>  A few years ago, before the appearance of automatic cash desks in Sunrise, my friends and I went there late in the evening to buy a computer, a monitor or a mouse. <br>  Placed an order, realized that we would expect it at least half an hour, and decided to buy coffee in the machine. <br><br>  One way or another, our eyes fell on the left keyboard at one of the terminals in the far corner of the hall, well away from the surveillance cameras.

      Never leave the keyboard unattended. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  If anyone forgot, the terminals were some kind of Linux, on which the browser was launched in fullscreen with limited rights.  For us, it was not important. <br>  We, three of us, huddling over the terminal so that we could not see what was happening there, began to think what to do.  It was necessary to access the system. <br>  Password we did not know. <br>  I don‚Äôt remember the details, but, switching to the console mode from X'ov, I remembered the wonderful combination ALT-SysRq ( <a href="http://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/sysrq.txt">http://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/sysrq.txt</a> ) <br>  It turned out that she works there!  We managed to reboot. <br>  Next, the matter of technology.  We edit the bootloader for single-mode mode, load, mount, change password, load into the system. <br>  Voila  What to do next? <br><br>  The idea was born quickly: if at all terminals the browser shows the default site with a catalog and price list, we need to try to become this site and write something cool there. <br><br>  Everything was complicated by the fact that in the distribution of the installed Linux there were no simple packages, such as wget or nmap :) <br>  We had ifconfig, ping, nc (Swiss knife, truly!) And ... perl, oddly enough. <br><br>  We did our best, scanned the network, it turned out that it was flat, and right on the server, which was the gateway for everyone, and the main site was located. <br>  Our plan was to write a small web server on perl, which would give the same page in a cycle, on the computer itself change the mac address and ip address to the same as the gateway, and then, due to constant ping , perhaps broad, make local switches update the fdb (aft) table with mac addresses in our favor, so that they think that the real host is right behind our port. <br><br>  What we did.  The only thing we did not take into account, and the process went wrong, perhaps because some of the packages still reached the real addressee.  Anyway, all browsers are frozen.  No transitions on the links did not work, everything hung in the place with which it was finished working. <br>  It was necessary to wash off quickly, because  people around already in neponyatkah began to depart from the terminal. <br><br>  We left the place safely.  Sunrise, according to various sources, lay all night and a piece of the day, and someone was fired. <br><br>  In the following releases, ‚Äúwho is smarter than he is right‚Äù can wait for you: ‚Äúprovider with blatant advertising and default snmp community‚Äù, ‚Äúprovider who forgot to remove demo.php file from standard spaw delivery‚Äù, ‚Äúsmall provincial provider and storm to order‚Äù . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/86887/">https://habr.com/ru/post/86887/</a></p>
