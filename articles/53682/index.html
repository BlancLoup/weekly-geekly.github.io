What prevents the experiment? <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  I go to <a href="http://www.free-lance.ru/">free-lance.ru</a> - the largest community of freelancers.  I register in such a way that I remain virtually anonymous.  Next, make up an ad for publication: <br><br>  <i>I need a logo for the illegal immigration center by tomorrow.</i>  <i>There is no other information except the name.</i>  <i>Name: Transkordonservis.</i>  <i>Send variants with WMR number to xxx@xxx.xx.</i>  <i>Payment upon acceptance of the option.</i>  <i>The logo is needed very urgently !!!!!</i> <br><br>  In my opinion, too beautiful for a client scalded with boiling water.  For authenticity, I would fill everything with caps, without punctuation and with errors.  However, we will not replay.

      I determine the budget: 108 rubles (3 US dollars). <br><br>  Before publication of the announcement, the resource administration offers paid accommodation for 85 bucks.  Allegedly, ‚Äúfor your project to be seen by those you are looking for.‚Äù  For the purity of the experiment, I refuse this tempting offer.  Although the joke would have turned out great: spend on ad placement is 30 times more than the development. <br><br>  Ad placed in the tape.  You can go to drink tea, but some kind of inner strength forces you to refresh the page.  And ... oh, horror!  No more ads.  Removed.  Is the budget too small?  Is the moderator rebuffed the unscrupulous miser?  I give up the slack and increase the budget to 150 rubles (a little more than 4 US dollars).  Post again. <br><br>  Announcement second time in the tape.  Already not to tea.  Nervously click Refresh.  There's an answer!  Someone is ready to work, but after a second the ad is killed again.  What is it?  Really embarrassed by the company?  Maybe contrary to the law?  ‚ÄúAnd for the third time, the old man threw a net‚Äù ... and also wrote an angry letter to the support service with a request to clarify the behavior of the moderator. <br><br>  The ad pops up for the third time in the feed and is deleted again.  It seems that the experiment failed, and did not begin.  But no!  The grain fell on fertile soil. <br><br>  34 minutes after the announcement is published, the first version of the logo falls into the mailbox.  The logo is immediately approved without editing and paid. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/comment_images/7a5/3ca/bcc/7a53cabcc2fb7dfd429613dd1b541b47.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  After 44 minutes after the announcement is published, the second version of the logo falls into the mailbox.  The logo is approved without changes and paid. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/c6c/267/d7d/c6c267d7d5991beeedea6ad36de64bba.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The answer comes from the administration of the resource to my angry request: <br><br>  <i>Contests can be placed only in a specific - paid section.</i>  <i>The cost of organizing the competition - 85FM.</i> <br><br>  No, they do not care about the administration of the resource legislation, ethics and unscrupulous exploitation of cheap labor.  She cares how the client bypassed paid services. <br><br>  After 1 hour and 20 minutes, four more logo variants fall into the mailbox.  The designer did not agree to give all four for the price of one.  I had to choose one option.  Approved without changes, paid. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/003/efe/237/003efe2374ff0f96b7e23381f4e7e48c.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Finally, the next day they sent another version of the logo.  Approved without changes, paid. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/705/760/bbc/705760bbc69a9a79296b9baa015a1e5c.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h4>  Result <br></h4><br>  The announcement published 3 times was in the tape for a total of about 5 minutes (1-1.5 minutes at a time).  Despite the refusal to use a paid service, during this short time, the ad was "seen by those who were looking for" a fictional customer. <br><br>  With a budget of 150 rubles, 7 logo variants from 4 designers were received.  The first option was made in half an hour.  2 options were made in 45 minutes.  6 options were made in less than 2 hours.  All options were made without prepayment and without any documented guarantees of payment for the work performed.  The contractor did not even know the real name of the customer.  Designers were ready to work without a technical assignment, knowing only the name and non-existent type of activity. <br><br>  Upd: Logo number one (the beast in a helmet) is a collage of clipart images for the program CorelDraw </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/53682/">https://habr.com/ru/post/53682/</a></p>
