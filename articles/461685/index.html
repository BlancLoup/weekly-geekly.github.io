In short, its action can be described something like this: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/o8/pp/ht/o8pphtdva85asgew3hha1h44q3i.jpeg"><br>  <i>Before after</i> <br><br>  In fact, everything is not so simple and not so "magical."  This magic has a history of research, and the so-called LED therapy deserves a couple of words and a couple of details: <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  As an introduction, probably, the idea should be made that most of the devices that are currently on the market for ‚Äúrejuvenation‚Äù, relief, fatigue relief and so on do not always inspire confidence.

      It makes no sense to list tons of cooling masks, smoothing wrinkles, massaging pads and other strange gizmos that are created on the principle of ‚ÄúNot harmful - and okay.‚Äù  The placebo effect replicated by the producers is multiplied by the ‚Äúpersonal feelings‚Äù of compassionate instagram women who happily confirm it. <br><br>  LED therapy is a slightly different story.  The history of the study has been going on for more than half a century, and during this time, low-level LED therapy received essentially two uses, depending on the wavelength. <br><br>  The most effective waves are 830 nm, which are recommended today for the active treatment of inflammatory processes and pain relief.  In particular, there are a number of studies that confirm that with LED therapy of the near infrared range <a href="https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/islsm/14/1/14_1_29/_article/-char/ja/">there is a</a> significant reduction in pain in professional athletes.  A similar effect is confirmed by <a href="">comparative</a> placebo tests. <br><br>  Effective pain management attracted increased attention to light therapy, and therefore studies continued: some of them confirmed the hypothesis that LED therapy can be used not only to relieve symptoms and pain, but also to <a href="https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/islsm/18/3/18_3_127/_article/-char/ja/">regenerate</a> cells and bones. <br><br>  The regeneration effect was confirmed in animal tests: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ef/m3/ja/efm3jatcra23elwut_kwm-7zbvq.jpeg"><br>  <i>Changes in the inflamed cells associated with dermatitis after irradiation with 830 nm LEDs in rats (A: control sample, B: sample irradiated with LED).</i>  <i>A marked decrease in inflammatory infiltration.</i> <br><br>  And when working with people: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/-w/gf/il/-wgfilf6lijorqhbdl9klr0xd_k.jpeg"><br>  <i>Improvement of the patient's condition (24-year-old woman) with post-chemical contact dermatitis resistant to treatment, causing skin irritation, noted above at the beginning of the study and less than 10 days after the LED sessions with a wavelength of 830 nm, with an interval of 3 days 20 minutes per session .</i> <br><br>  Such tests and experiments quite unequivocally lead the authors of <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3799034/">review</a> articles to conclusions like this: <br><br><blockquote>  Currently, published literature strongly recommends 830 nm for all aspects of wound healing, pain, anti-inflammatory treatment and skin rejuvenation, with a combination of 415 nm and 633 nm for the treatment of only mild active inflammation of acne vulgaris.  If the wavelength is incorrect, optimal absorption will not occur, and, as the first law of photobiology says, the Grott-Draper law, there can be no reaction without absorption. </blockquote><br>  Actually, the time has just come to say that <b>size matters</b> .  And if 830 nm waves look like a panacea in most cases, then 630 ¬± waves (on the basis of which LED Magic works) is just more about cosmetology and beauty. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/6c/-q/_f/6c-q_fbqawk65sckm816guogqe8.jpeg"><br>  <i>Penetration of waves of different lengths</i> <br><br>  The effectiveness of 630 nm waves was also confirmed during healing, pain relief, but in combination with 830 nm waves.  Separately, today they are used both in clinical practice and in home cosmetology as a means <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16020203/">against acne</a> , <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18459515/">superficial</a> skin <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18459515/">cleansing</a> , smoothing wrinkles. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/qo/of/mj/qoofmjkrnjp038n9dcimcveba8u.jpeg"><br><br>  A wavelength of 630 nm in a number of articles <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19587693/">is called a</a> safe strategy for enhancing collagen, which is just directed against skin aging, increasing elasticity / elasticity, etc. <br><br><blockquote>  After 12 LED treatments, it was noted that more than 90% of people observed a decrease in wrinkle depth and surface roughness, 87% of people reported that they had a decrease in the severity of Fitzpatrick's wrinkles. </blockquote><br>  <b>What does the market offer?</b> <br><br>  LED Magic is not the only offer, of course, but large manufacturers with professional medical equipment for clinics were the first to come to this market.  In this sense, finding a ‚Äúservice‚Äù is not so difficult. <br><br>  Of the players whose equipment is used in tests and clinical reviews, you can name, for example, <a href="https://omniluxled.com/">OmniLux</a> , <a href="https://www.lightwavetherapy.com/">Lightwavetherapy</a> (although there are consumer solutions here) and some others.  The most popular brand at the time in the home rejuvenation market was the <a href="">Neutrogena</a> brand - the cost of devices was at the level of 50-60 pounds. <br><br>  True, as they say, the best is the enemy of the good: at present, the most popular product has been recalled due to precautionary reasons, as described on the official website: <br><br><blockquote>  You may have noticed that NEUTROGENA mask and activator for light therapy are not available when you make purchases in the UK and Ireland.  This is because these products have been recalled.  Our decision to recall this product is taken as a precaution.  The NEUTROGENA Light Therapy Acne Mask is safe for most people to use once a day for its intended purpose.  Reports of visual effects associated with the use of the NEUTROGENA light therapy mask are rare, usually mild and transient.  For a small population with certain underlying eye diseases, as well as for users taking medications that can increase the photosensitivity of the eye, there is a theoretical risk of eye damage. </blockquote><br>  In this sense, LED Magic is much safer: firstly, the session is limited in time to 8 minutes, and secondly, this is not a mask that completely closes your eyes - but patches that are attached under them. <br><br>  <b>What is a device</b> <br><br>  <a href="https://medgadgets.ru/shop/claigio-led-magic-eye-patch.html%3Futm_source%3Dhabr%26utm_medium%3Dledmagic%26utm_campaign%3Dpre">LED Magic</a> is a South Korean device, which is a fairly simple device for connecting to a smartphone. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/3i/ir/hm/3iirhmk6_fzt-1mv1dvmcx66ldo.jpeg"><br><br>  The main value here is the ‚Äústicky‚Äù patches that are placed on the skin.  Each of them is separately connected to the wires. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/nc/yx/4f/ncyx4fmhjjwmvphbwgmnvsjnw10.jpeg"><br><br>  In these patches, diodes with a wavelength of 600 - 660 nm are located.  They are turned on by pressing a button. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/im/fe/je/imfejejgfio921dqhjxhxqjaygy.jpeg"><br><br>  Everything is arranged quite safely: patches exclude contact with the eyes, and the session itself is automatically designed for 8 minutes. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/zz/0m/9o/zz0m9og6dehoc3uczfb7lkgltrc.jpeg"><br><br>  The starter wire has a MicroUSB connector.  Included are adapters for IOS / Type-C. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ck/1s/sq/ck1ssq2gj37dmnpk0mwpwahc__i.jpeg"><br><br>  <b>As a result</b> <br><br>  As <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4126803/">noted</a> in a number of scientific articles, LED therapy today is a fairly popular and really ‚Äúmainstream‚Äù medical field, which is addressed in various fields: from rehabilitation medicine to cosmetology. <br><br>  At home, LED therapy can be used to prevent age-related skin changes and cleansing, which is generally relevant for both men and women.  Devices are universal. <br><br>  Prices for devices of this kind on average at the level of 5,000 rubles, and LED Magic from South Korea in this case is no exception.  Its main advantages are versatility, dependence on a smartphone only, compact size and safety. <br><br>  In this case, by security we mean the lack of contact with the eyes - the reason why some masks were withdrawn from sale - and the limited session time.  You can pre-order LED Magic <a href="https://medgadgets.ru/shop/claigio-led-magic-eye-patch.html%3Futm_source%3Dhabr%26utm_medium%3Dledmagic%26utm_campaign%3Dpre">on our website</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/461685/">https://habr.com/ru/post/461685/</a></p>
