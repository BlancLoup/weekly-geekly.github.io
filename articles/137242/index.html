  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How to choose the main tasks</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  How often can you observe a situation where the to-do lists are made less than 10%.  Because we are all trying to cram in one day, a week, etc. <br><br>  The first step is to realize the illusiveness of the importance of affairs.  Percent ninety-five cases, you can simply throw in the trash.  You understand this perfectly well when you suddenly become unwell, or for some other reason were not available for ‚Äúimportant‚Äù cases.  No one dies, and you yourself remain alive. <br><img src="http://img689.imageshack.us/img689/7015/decision300.png"><br><br>  It is especially clearly seen how this insight changes people's lives, on some businessmen and downshifters.  People suddenly begin to appreciate simple things, travel a lot, and this, at first glance, seems strange.  In fact, the illusion of importance is a good mechanism.  It is beneficial to those who own the masses, because it allows you to easily manage the affairs of the people, creating false-important tasks.  However, the post is not about <strike>ZOG</strike> it.

      In fact, to realize the illusiveness of the importance of affairs in our world is only the first step.  The most difficult thing is to make the right choice. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  If a person is active and active, he always has more things to do in his life than he can do in a day, a week, a month. <br>  We have to face a choice: what to do first.  Or, if you look differently, it is much more important to make a choice from which you can refuse. <br><br>  That is, do not try to do everything at once.  We must first drop everything except the main one.  And leave only the essential. <br><br>  How to do it? <br><br>  Need a "Focus."  This is what I call it.  Someone calls this the <strike>answer to the main question to the question of the universe the</strike> top priority.  A good example is Steve Jobs, who every day compared his work with the thesis ‚Äúwhat if this day was the last in my life‚Äù and achieved outstanding success. <br><br><blockquote>  <i>‚ÄúThe memory that I will die soon is the most important tool that helps me make difficult decisions in my life ... The memory of death is the best way to avoid thinking about what you have to lose.</i>  <i>You are already naked.</i>  <i>You have no reason not to go to the call of your heart "</i> <br>  Steve Jobs, a genius. <br></blockquote><br><br>  What is surprising, in many intelligent books they write about it, but in different words.  In the awesome ‚ÄúFirst say no‚Äù, Jim Camp writes that it is important to have a mission in your life in order to be a successful negotiator.  The same for success as an entrepreneur requires to get hold of the author of "Startup without a budget."  Even Tim Ferris offers similar ideas as a way to success. <br><br>  In addition to the focus, I personally highlight a few more points: <br>  1. Any task that is done without focus cannot be completed. <br>  2. Bringing the task to the end is not natural for a person, it requires super-efforts, perseverance and labor.  That is why I often work for 12-15 hours. <br>  3. The possibilities of the organism are finite.  Need a rest.  Therefore, I apply the theory of restrictions to the organization of life. <br>  4. Time is more important than money.  Like in the movie where the currency was time.  Three free hours from the road due to a rented apartment is much more important than a cool car and standing in traffic jams 5 hours a day.  In the first case, you have an additional 60 hours per month, in the second you lose 100 hours with harm to health. <br><br>  An example of a focus: ‚Äúautomation of the contract department, reengineering of business processes‚Äù.  All incoming tasks are compared for compliance with this trick, and if they do not fit, they are simply postponed. <br><br>  Therefore, if suddenly you realize that your lists are huge, and things are not moving forward - try to stop writing them.  Say sick for a week, try to restructure your thinking and realize that the "important" tasks are not really important.  And with the second step, try to highlight for yourself the main priority for at least a month and connect all tasks with it, and strictly reject the rest. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/137242/">https://habr.com/ru/post/137242/</a></p>
