  <section class="page js-page"><h1>What stories will be popular in terms of information noise. Future storytelling</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Storyteling or the art of storytelling is a fashionable topic.  There are many courses and webinars where they offer to teach us this science.  But why?  What role does this skill play in our lives?  Why do we tell stories? <br><br>  In the distant past, when there were no books yet or they were rare, the art of telling stories was revered - it served as the basis for the education of that time.  The storytellers, runners, clowns, troubadours not only entertained the public, they conveyed knowledge.  Dressed in the figurative and rhythmic shell of songs, legends, they were literally <i>imprinted</i> in the minds of people.  It was not just knowledge that was transmitted, but impressions ‚Äî knowledge with deep emotional coloring, connected into a general figurative picture, deeply rooted in consciousness.  This process is beautifully and artistically described in Anne McMurffhire's novels The Chronicles of Pern.  Out of a multitude of such images, a picture of the world was formed - a world view.  A worldview, in many respects, determines our actions.  Ultimately, stories are what motivates us to act in a certain way.  The one who tells the stories, controls the actions, deeds, the fate of other people. <br><br>  The management process is an important task, art has long been turned into a science and is continuously developing and improving.  Let's follow the main stages of this development and try to predict what to expect from it in the future. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Back in the middle of the last century, G.S.  Altshuller, the founder of the theory of creativity discovered that any idea passes through four stages in its development: 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>
        <script>
          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      1. Single implementation <br>  2. Multiple implementation <br>  3. There is no physical embodiment of the idea, but its functions are performed. <br>  4. There is no need for a physical realization of the idea. <br><br>  And so, at the first stage there are single stories and their translators, as a rule, these stories are united by a common worldview, forming a complete picture of the world in consciousness. <br><br>  As the transition to the second stage and its development, the number of stories begins to increase, the number of their carriers increases.  Stories based on other models of the world appear, stories begin to compete with each other, the listener's mind is divided into conflicts, the need for protection from ‚Äúalien information‚Äù arises, all sorts of filters and barriers appear, as well as ways to circumvent them, there is a need for a compass This ocean of stories allows you to determine what to believe, who to listen to.  Gradually, the usual channels of distribution of stories are blocked.  There is a contradiction, on the one hand the stories are needed, on the other they cannot be told, they will not be heard. <br><br>  And here we go to the third level - "the stories are not told, but their functions are performed."  But, first of all, it is important not to tell the story itself, but to form its imprint in the memory and consciousness of a person, to create a certain set of connected images and meanings in his consciousness.  And here's the idea - the man himself invents and tells the necessary story.  How to do it?  Managing the attention of a person, directing him to some facts, phenomena and contradictions between them.  Contradictions give rise to questions and hypotheses, stimulate the search for new facts.  As a result, his own picture of the world is created in the head, obtained as a result of his own research, and therefore, it is much more reliable for a person than anything that he receives from outside in the form of a semi-finished product. <br><br>  In what situation the need to create and tell stories can disappear altogether.  Let me remind you that stories convey impressions in which a certain experience is packed and are told with a view to introducing a person into the desired emotional state and to form or cause some preferred type of behavior.  Under what conditions will this goal lose its relevance? <br><br>  1. The world is on the verge of chaos, the former patterns of behavior stop working, there is no use in broadcasting them. <br><br>  2. The world crystallized, stopped.  Variations of possible behaviors are minimized.  There is no freedom of choice.  All sorts of caste societies with rigidly fixed rituals of behavior. <br><br>  3. The presence of a developed, self-learning intellect, able to build effective activities in any, even rapidly changing conditions.  By the way, such intelligence may develop as a result of the implementation of the previous level of development of street-building. <br><br>  4. Emotions are forbidden or a person has lost the ability to experience emotions, stories, as a way to transfer the emotional state, are no longer needed. <br><br>  5.On the contrary, a person can fully control his emotional state, causing the necessary experiences, in this case, stories, as well as the method of external control of them, are also not needed. <br><br>  The emergence of such phenomena as transmedia communications, games in alternative reality (ARG), the development of educational systems based on the research activity of the child suggests that our society enters the third phase of development of storytelling - controlling the attention of a person, throwing riddles along his way to design your stories, collect them in your picture of the world. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/340692/">https://habr.com/ru/post/340692/</a></p>
