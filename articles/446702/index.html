      Conventionally, they can be divided into several types: <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b>1. Headphones that can analyze sleep</b> <br><br>  Sleep trackers are quite a popular trend, but most often users get by with a bracelet that defines sleep phases with sufficient accuracy for general understanding. <br><br>  In this sense, analyzer headphones seem to be a bit like the white crow.  But the logic in this gadget is: equipped with sensors that are located on the head, such headphones, probably, can give a more accurate picture of the phases.  An example is the <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1861630723/take-control-of-your-sleep-with-kokoon-eeg-headpho">Kokoon EEG</a> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/jd/ng/zb/jdngzbtbpc15qphiwxzjgh1hkpq.jpeg"><br><br>  Here, apart from all analytics, they also promise a good sound, a convenient construction: it should be comfortable to lie in such headphones - it means that the cushion is soft here.  And the ventilation system: since the headphones are closed, it is necessary. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/em/iy/vw/emiyvwszp2xhta5abdfft5i-tiu.png"><br><br>  <b>2. Anti-noise headphones</b> <br><br>  These headphones can also be recognized as ‚Äúheadphones for sleeping‚Äù, because they are designed to create a comfortable atmosphere, silence, reduce noise around.  Recently, with one of these options, we introduced you - <a href="https://habr.com/ru/company/medgadgets/blog/446422/">QuietON</a> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/qg/y8/ng/qgy8ngzdjtvdoq1hkc5uccr4etg.jpeg"><br><br>  In their ‚Äúapplicability‚Äù, of course, they are much more versatile, but as headsets for falling asleep are positioned, they perform their task of reducing noise. <br><br>  <b>3. Sound for falling asleep</b> <br><br>  The main problem with the headphones in any case one: a low level of comfort for the listener.  Headphones somehow dictate the position, limiting the position.  Despite the fact that the person in the photo in the first paragraph sleeps on his side, in fact it will not be very comfortable.  Therefore, for those who are accustomed to falling asleep to music or a book, they came up with a <a href="https://habr.com/ru/company/medgadgets/blog/406919/">pillow with bone conduction sound</a> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/2d2/925/3f7/2d29253f78444a479a1f7acdf305093c.jpg"><br><br>  Among all the other features, it‚Äôs still necessary to remember that when dealing with bone conduction, a person remains slightly limited in terms of sound.  However, as the sound on the background is not the worst decision, well, except that in form it is never a headset. <br><br>  <b>4. Headbands</b> <br><br>  And finally, there is a category of headphones with a soft headband.  In our case, this is <a href="https://medgadgets.ru/shop/katalog/sleepphones.html%3Futm_source%3Dhabr%26utm_medium%3Dsleepphones%26utm_campaign%3Dsleepphones">SleepPhones</a> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/mm/j7/ke/mmj7ke-6_ysxditpzpgtp-pax4s.jpeg"><br><br>  Generally, to be honest, the thing is cool.  What are they like? <br><br>  The most important difference from other headphones - headband.  This is a soft headband: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/j6/t3/aj/j6t3ajxfe9eqdkyezkog17fknpw.jpeg"><br><br><blockquote>  This form provides complete freedom in bed: you can turn your head, you can lie on your side, you can not worry that the headband will break if you accidentally fall asleep in these headphones - complete freedom of movement and safety for the design. </blockquote><br>  Inside are the speakers, which are covered with a soft cloth. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/fd/zm/ej/fdzmejkctv7hmoktasqwnpxqmbm.jpeg"><br><br>  This is done for several reasons.  First, for the comfort and convenience of the listener.  We at one time tested similar dressings from China, where the speakers were of a similar shape: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/t-/pd/sg/t-pdsgimym3zw-r9b4xhzdwcrwo.png"><br><br>  That is, they were thick, plastic, solid, which frankly is not very convenient.  Secondly, this is done to protect the speakers themselves: they are not covered inside. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/fw/1e/p0/fw1ep01csou74rxpcfwhna-qwg0.jpeg"><br><br>  And, finally, some noise isolation is achieved in this way, so that the sound for a loved one, which lies next to it, is less distinguishable. <br><br><blockquote>  Here is a small example of how they sound at full volume: <a href="https://vocaroo.com/i/s0TpTb56fNFx">recording to a voice recorder of a smartphone</a> lying on a table.  A man in headphones sits at a computer nearby.  When you listen, BG is visible, of course. </blockquote><br>  <b>Alternatives?</b> <br><br>  Of course, we need to consider them as headphones for sleeping, to help us fall asleep, and they look very decent in their category: here you will find pleasant eco-friendly material, good sound, and what is important for a Western user is ‚Äúthought out safety‚Äù. <br><br>  One of the key features that manufacturers are paying attention to is <i>‚ÄúEnvironmentally friendly electronics, without the presence of lead.</i>  <i>The headband material is designed in accordance with the international environmental standard RoHS. ‚Äù</i> <br><br>  However, at home, of course, you can get by with simpler ways: in the end, no one will forbid to fall asleep in the gags, but when you turn on your side, you have to pull one of the headphones out of your ear: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/mg/61/o-/mg61o-lqvvamfm7wmvuq1g0hwju.png"><br><br>  You can listen to music / books and without headphones.  In this case, it will also be available to others.  But nevertheless, it seems that such headphones are not strictly required to purchase. <br><br>  But their convenience they bribe.  By the way, as a safety feature is used and poor insulation, which is well perceived in the West: <br><br><ul><li>  You are not completely disconnected from reality, you can hear external sounds, you will hear a loud fire alarm. </li><li>  The voice of a crying baby will also be clearly visible. </li><li>  If an outsider is trying to get into the house, it can also be heard if the headphones are not unscrewed to the maximum </li></ul><br>  And, of course, falling asleep in these headphones, you can hear the sound of the alarm without any problems.  In other words, in terms of comfort, convenience and relative safety, such headphones look like no alternative.  We get: <br><br><ul><li>  Movable speakers: you can not put them directly to the ear, move inside the dressing </li><li>  Pleasant material that does not rub, does not irritate the skin </li><li>  Flexible and soft headband - will not break, will not be damaged, will not hold down movements </li><li>  Soft speakers - do not damage the ear, will not cause discomfort </li><li>  The dressing can be moved over the eyes - in this case there will be a mask </li></ul><br>  <b>How do SleepPhones sound</b> <br><br>  To begin with, here are some quotes from reviews: <br><br><blockquote>  I expected a decent sound for this price (we are talking about a wireless model - <i>note</i> ), and I was not disappointed.  And in fact, I was very surprised by the sound quality of these small speakers.  <a href="https://www.thesleepjudge.com/acousticsheep-sleepphones-review/"><i>A source</i></a> </blockquote><br><blockquote>  The included removable speakers provide surprisingly good sound quality and sound insulation. Provide pleasant, natural sound reproduction.  Of course, you should not really expect an audiophile quality, as the headphones were designed for quieter playback with less emphasis on detail.  For example, in combination with an audiobook, these headphones really manifest themselves, and their unfatiguing nature makes them excellent for long-term listening.  <a href="https://www.headphoneslab.com/acousticsheep-sleepphones-classic-sleep-headphones-review/"><i>A source</i></a> </blockquote><br>  In general, the sound here is quite decent: the headphones sound a little duller, as is noted, but still, they were called ‚Äúnon-detailed‚Äù in a hurry.  Much depends on the personal requirements for them.  For example, if you just need pleasant music in the background, then you can completely move the speaker from the ear - of course, in this case, when the sound is transmitted through the air, some loss will be felt. <br><br>  They also have their own charms - such a weightless design and lack of insulation makes the sound seem to be voluminous, it is a rather pleasant sensation of sound in space when nothing presses, and the melody sounds as if in a room.  Given that the developers have tried to make them artificially quieter, the volume is more than enough in sum, and the frequency range corresponds to modern standards - 20-20000 Hz.  In other words, as an audio device - this is also not the worst choice for individual use. <br><br>  Well, in between times, audiophile requests for electronics are often more ‚Äúexpensive‚Äù.  There has never been such a device, costing from 3 thousand rubles, which would satisfy the hearing of an audiophile. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/u-/pt/nw/u-ptnwvjictd7dr5xl8voc-vsac.jpeg"><br><br>  <b>Headphones are currently sold in two versions:</b> <br><br><ul><li>  <a href="https://medgadgets.ru/shop/sleepphones-mjagkie-naushniki-dlja-sna.html%3Futm_source%3Dhabr%26utm_medium%3Dsleepphones%26utm_campaign%3Dsleepphones">Wired</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://medgadgets.ru/shop/sleepphones-mjagkie-naushniki-dlja-sna-bluetooth.html%3Futm_source%3Dhabr%26utm_medium%3Dsleepphones%26utm_campaign%3Dsleepphones">Wireless</a> </li></ul><br>  There is no difference in sound - the speakers are the same everywhere.  The difference is in price.  But for each of the models we have a 15% discount for all interested: <b>HABR15</b> until the end of this week. <br><br>  <b>As a result</b> <br><br>  <b>Headphones as an aid in falling asleep</b> <br><br>  The positive or negative influence of music on the process of falling asleep is a moot point.  But someone is really more comfortable, someone falls asleep under the series of your favorite series or book.  In this sense, the question remains, whether to listen to the full, to listen to in headphones and in what headphones. <br><br>  <b>SleepPhones vs Ordinary headphones</b> <br><br>  SleepPhones has a number of absolute advantages both in terms of comfort for the wearer: you do not need to choose a comfortable position - any position will be comfortable.  So from the point of view of safety for the design: if you accidentally fall asleep in them, then there is no risk to the speakers, the headband. <br><br>  <b>Decent sound</b> <br><br>  Headphones sound very decent, close the audible frequency range, the volume for individual use is more than enough, and in the proposed use case, they sound better than many popular plugs. <br><br>  <b>Wired vs Wireless</b> <br><br>  Wired headphones work through Jack.  Now in 2019, when smartphone makers are abandoning it more and more, this can be a problem.  True, the same manufacturers most often kindly put in adapters, so there will probably be no problems. <br><br>  And this is where our next story about ‚Äúweird headphones‚Äù comes to an end.  Thank you all for your attention! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/446702/">https://habr.com/ru/post/446702/</a></p>
