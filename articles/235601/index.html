  <section class="page js-page"><h1>App Market for glasses Epson Moverio BT-200 (September, 2014)</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Articles about augmented reality glasses Epson Moverio unexpectedly interested me - at least some news about the hardware from Android, which differs from the dull ‚Äúbricks‚Äù with growing diagonals.  And since ‚Äújust Android‚Äù, I wanted to try to program something for them. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/1a3/e8b/458/1a3e8b458476442980eada60cceb9b10.png" alt="image"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  I‚Äôll say right away that I don‚Äôt have the device, but in the publications the representatives of the manufacturer eloquently write that everything is very simple - there is a regular Android.  Specifications that have already been written, you can read on <a href="http://epson.ru/catalog/moverio/epson-moverio-bt-200/">the manufacturer's website</a> . <br><br>  The axis there is declared v.4.0.4, the screen resolution is 960 x 540 pixels, with their usual density of 160 dpi, only landscape orientation.

      The main thing that an application developer needs to take into account is that the black color in the applications will be transparent and background. <br><br>  The site surprised me with wretchedness: in the market so far there are exactly 30 applications, including instructions for the device, and it all looks like in the 90s of the 20th century - see the title picture, it must be very ‚Äúeye-catching‚Äù.  Description of applications when poking on the icon also look "attractive": <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/bc6/8f1/5c3/bc68f15c3d4f43c68f01733bde95350a.png" alt="image"><br><br>  It seems that the site is entirely made in Java and JavaScript.  Static links to the application do not seem to get. <br><br>  The developer console is also minimalist, but therefore it cuts its eyes smaller: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d7f/6c3/2d5/d7f6c32d5df14e678f3d0709cf39066b.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Right there in the corner are references to agreements and rules that applications must comply with, documents in old school static HTML.  If you gape, the site navigation is interrupted by a page with a message about timeout. <br><br>  Requirements for added applications differ markedly from those of the Google Play Market: on the one hand, it‚Äôs simpler, because there‚Äôs less information required, on the other hand, the Japanese need to provide a .DOCX file with a label (check list) filled in by the developer <i>manually</i> (!) For each change in the application or publication of a new one.  Just like in the native tax inspection, although they are slowly converting their software closer to the ‚Äúmind‚Äù. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/0e6/86d/54a/0e686d54af534e4092d22e3e1f5c2c01.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Localization of applications is required only English, but native Japanese authors can also be entered immediately.  It is proposed to enter other description languages ‚Äã‚Äãsimply in one common field, one under the other. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/555/c40/f3d/555c40f3d43c4095a7a6fb77d490ab5a.png" alt="image"><br><br>  I tried to adapt my one old program, invented back in 2009 and made under Win Mobile 5 \ 6, and then ported to Android (voice GPS navigator) under the device screen, made screenshots and an icon for the new requirements, and I‚Äôm waiting for some result of its sending for consideration. <br><br>  But the main goal of the post is that, it turns out, PayPal business accounts are required to try to sell their paid applications in this ‚Äúmarket‚Äù from the developer.  That is corporate.  Which is only for legal entities (or SP).  Where the type of business should be clearly described and the account can be closed if PayPal suspects. <br><br>  Thus, it seems to me that individual programmers, unlike the conditions of Google, do not have much interest in becoming developers for this Epson platform.  And they really hope, arranging a competition, in which I, too, would venture to participate with my software trick.  But the external unattractiveness of the website, in my opinion, plays against the developers, in general, a very interesting piece of hardware.  It would be interesting to know the opinion of Epson representatives. <br><br>  Thank you for your attention, maybe someone will be useful. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/235601/">https://habr.com/ru/post/235601/</a></p>
