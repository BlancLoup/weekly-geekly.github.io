  <section class="page js-page"><h1>About scientific companies programmers</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Hello.  In the footsteps of the " <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/189996/">cyber war</a> " post, I would like to tell the people about the scientific companies of programmers.  There is some information on the Internet on this topic, but I decided to write this article to put a dot (almost all) over i. <br><br>  Just want to draw your attention to the fact that I am <b>not the</b> official representative of the Ministry of Defense.  Therefore, all the information you find here may be inaccurate or unreliable. <br><br>  I learned about the scientific companies of programmers in early July of this year, however, not the news site enlighten me on this issue.  The fact is that in my university just at that time there was a meeting of students with representatives of the Ministry of Defense (initiated by the latter).  Actually, the content of this particular conversation, I would like to share with the inhabitants of Habr.

      A few days before the delegation arrived, relevant information appeared on the faculty website.  I, as a lover of military equipment, was curious, and I decided to come.  Quite a few people came to the meeting, which is easily explained by the time of the meeting - most of the guys have already managed to leave.  In the end, we had about ten people.  The ministry was represented by two men in the form of a navy: one of them introduced himself as a rear admiral, and I did not remember the rank of the second (or did not recognize).  Most of the conversation we asked questions, and the military answered them, so I will try to do the same. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b>What are the scientific companies of programmers created for?</b> <br>  In short, the country's leadership decided to catch up with our information technology gap from other countries (such as the United States).  In particular, one of the projects is the transfer of the activities of the ministries to a digital basis and the creation of some kind of own network for the connection of all nodes of the government.  The project is very ambitious, and, as I understand it, it is primarily intended to improve the country's defense capability.  The rear admiral, for example, compared it with the creation of the USSR atomic bomb. <br><br>  <b>Why now?</b> <br>  This is how it happened.  As rumors and gossip: there is information that a few days before this conversation, the president held a meeting, the results of which quickly decided to create a scientific company. <br><br>  <b>Who take in scientific companies programmers?</b> <br>  First of all, these are university graduates and undergraduates (not sure about postgraduate students).  Theoretically, the one who finished the third year in the summer can also enroll, but then he will have to provide some kind of recommendation from the supervisor, saying, too, is not a fool.  Interestingly, the possibility of the participation in this project of citizens of other states is allowed.  First of all, it concerns Belarus, as a union state. <br><br>  <b>What will they do in these companies?</b> <br>  Immediately it should be said that participation in this project means the passage of military service.  Accordingly, if a person has not served, then this is a great chance to combine business with pleasure. <br>  Will have to deal primarily with scientific activities.  Those.  first, you will pass the course of a young fighter, give an oath, and then begin to do directly what it was all about.  No one will force to run on the parade ground in boots and to clean the toilets.  In fact, you will go to work as an ordinary civilian, but at the same time you will be a soldier. <br><br>  <b>Take all comers?</b> <br>  No, not all. <br>  First, there is rigorous selection.  I don‚Äôt have exact numbers, but out of a huge number of willing (several thousand people) only a few hundred will be taken into companies.  The selection will take into account both scientific training and interest. <br>  Secondly, a person must be elementary suitable for service.  Those.  persons over 27 years old are unlikely to be taken, and minimal physical training is necessary.  By the way, there are some problems with those who studied at the time in the military department.  This is due to the fact that such a person already has a rank (reserve lieutenant, if I'm not mistaken), and scientific companies can be regarded as a call for military service. <br>  But all problems can be solved, especially if a person has a desire (the rear admiral said that all this can be reconsidered). <br><br>  <b>Only programmers are recruited?</b> <br>  No, they recruit various specialists, even psychologists.  I suppose, for example, that among the tasks being solved there will be a simulation and forecasting of the geopolitical situation, so there will be a place for many. <br><br>  <b>How long will the service last?</b> <br>  The service will last a year.  The first month you go through the KMB, after which you take the oath.  The next two months, you will look for solutions to the problem you received.  If your path suits the supervisor (will be assigned to you already at the place of service), then you can proceed to the task, and each month will report on the work done. <br><br>  <b>And what will happen if I fail / I do not want?</b> <br>  If you have something does not come out, then you can always contact the supervisor.  In any case, they will not be punished for this =) If you express an unwillingness to continue scientific activities for the benefit of the Motherland, you will probably just be sent to another part for already regular military service.  At the same time, the choice of the part remains with the authorities.  Thus, if everything is good, then you should sit in a captain, but if there have been cases of misconduct, you can send to serve far away and in a part worse. <br><br>  <b>What are the conditions at the service site?</b> <br>  They promised that everything will be on the level.  Not luxury, of course, but you will not live in the barracks either.  Actually, due to housing problems, the number of recruited companies has decreased. <br><br>  <b>And I have a wife / children?</b> <br>  These problems are also called solvable.  If you have already managed to acquire a spouse, then, probably, she will also be provided with housing.  Regarding the children I can not say anything. <br>  In general, judging by what the representatives of the Ministry of Defense said, it was possible to understand that they are ready to solve the problems of scientists.  The main thing that the latter diligently did their work. <br><br>  <b>What about secrecy?</b> <br>  Level of tolerance will allow travel abroad.  You can also discuss some things with your friends, but, of course, this will all be regulated. <br><br>  <b>What will I do for it?</b> <br>  One can hardly count on some kind of monetary reward, but they promised some bonuses (yes, yes, everything is foggy). <br><br>  <b>When should I give an answer?</b> <br>  At that time, for the decision making, the doubters had only half a day, from the power of the day.  The military expressed regret that there is no more time to think, but it happened.  Received orders and proceeded to fulfill. <br><br>  <b>Will there be more sets in scientific companies?</b> <br>  Not known.  This is an experiment, and what results it will bring is not clear.  Depending on these very results, the set in the next year can either be increased, or completely removed. <br><br>  Well, that's all the questions that I remembered. <br>  If you have your own questions, ask them in the comments - I will try to answer. <br>  In conclusion, I can say that I consider this opportunity to be an excellent option.  If I met the criteria, I would love to sign up myself.  Where else will they be offered to do what they love for the good of the Motherland, and even serve in the army? <br><br>  <b>UPD</b> : I found the following words in the comments to the post <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/189996/">about</a> " <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/189996/">cyber military</a> ": <br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Comment</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><blockquote> <b>enotys</b> <br>  This year I finished the magistracy of St. Petersburg NRU ITMO in the field of information security.  Of course, the question has become to serve or not to serve.  Literally 2 days before the end of the spring draft - July 13 (call until July 15).  Some general who came to ITMO who was responsible for recruiting these ‚Äúlegendary‚Äù cyber-forces.  There was something like an open day.  I myself could not be present because  worked, but what they told me. <br><br>  Question: <br>  Graduate NRU ITMO KTiU <br>  To the attention of those who: <br>  1. Able to program. <br>  2. Good (can be limited) to military service. <br>  3. Did not pass the military department. <br>  4. He wants to work a year in Moscow at the Ministry of Defense, and this will be reckoned as an urgent service <br><br>  Is it possible to find out the details of this program somewhere?  Is there any kind of zp?  What languages ‚Äã‚Äãand technologies do you need to know?  How to solve the problem of living in Moscow?  Will it be a 40-hour work week or is it an emergency service? <br><br>  Answer: <br>  Hermann Krimmel <br>  Sergey, housing provides min.  defense (I understand something like a barracks), the salary is the monetary allowance of a soldier.  In fact, this is military service, but instead of digging trenches and drill you go to work.  They say even you can not wear a uniform and do not shave your head.  But there is still not quite clear what and how - tomorrow only will be a directive, which will be regulated by the service.  Like that. <br><br>  After that, he wrote a letter to the Ministry of Defense.  I've been waiting for a response for the 3rd week.  How to answer be sure to share information.  Along the way, I am going to find out through acquaintances involved in the call.  It just seems to me that vacancies at the Ministry of Defense and cyber war are slightly different things. </blockquote></div></div><br>  This is, in fact, in confirmation of the fact that no one will race on the parade ground there. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/285590/">https://habr.com/ru/post/285590/</a></p>
