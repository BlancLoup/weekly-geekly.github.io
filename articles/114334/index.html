One and a half - two dozen monotonous keywords that must be present on the same page of text;  thematic core of the site, the description of which already takes up half a page ... <br><br>  ‚ÄúA copywriter with work experience will reveal to you the main rule of the text for the site: if you meet a social worker, kill him,‚Äù said an unknown copywriter. <br><br>  We, speaking for world peace (OK, let's start small - for peace in the professional community) tried to collect tips that make life easier:

      * to <b>copywriters</b> , for whom the literary value of their texts is important, and the presence of five synonyms in two sentences in a row destroys all ideas of the beautiful. <br>  * <b>SEO-specialists</b> , who in the project, by chance, assigned the role of copywriter or copywriter manager. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  <b>1. Take complex TK as an opportunity to show skill and ingenuity, and not a reason for despair.</b> <br><br>  Try to start work even on the most complex text not with the words: ‚ÄúOh God!‚Äù, But with the words: ‚ÄúHmm, a non-trivial task - it will be interesting to come up with a beautiful solution for it‚Äù.  ‚ÄúThe advice is in the style of Dale Carnegie and other American psychologists,‚Äù you think.  Not at all.  Much really depends on the mood (and fighting spirit!) With which you sit down to work. <br><br>  <b>2. After opening a blank document, write down a list of all the words you need to use in the text.</b> <br><br>  ... And as soon as the keyword will take its rightful place in your work, remove it from the list above.  First, it will help not to miss anything.  And secondly, as the list shrinks, the task that initially seemed unreal will become quite familiar and standard. <br><br>  <b>3. Remember the secret: saving a copywriter working with complex TK is the correct structure of the texts.</b> <br><br>  Texts written for the Internet, as you know, should be read diagonally.  Breakdown of the text into logical blocks and the use of bulleted lists help achieve this effect.  This not only helps to make the text consistent and easy to read from the screen, but also gives a lot of opportunities to organically enter keywords into the text. <br><br>  The ‚Äútrick‚Äù is that the text written in the form of fragmentary sentences and key ideas is read differently from the usual ‚Äúconnected‚Äù literary text.  Due to this, many keywords can be ‚Äúpunched‚Äù into it - even monotonous - and this will not irritate the reader. <br><br>  <b>Example:</b> <br><br>  <i>Types of <b>live animals</b> transported</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>The company is ready to organize the delivery of various types of animals.</i>  <i>Holding specialists have experience in transportation:</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>* pigs (breeding and slaughter)</i> <i><br></i>  <i>* horses (breeding and sporting)</i> <i><br></i>  <i>* cattle (breeding and slaughter)</i> <i><br></i>  <i>* sheep</i> <i><br></i>  <i>* goats</i> <i><br></i>  <i>* alpaca</i> <i><br></i>  <i>* live fish</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>Geography of <b>delivery of live animals</b></i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>* between the countries of Europe, CIS and Baltic</i> <i><br></i>  <i>* between the CIS countries</i> <i><br></i>  <i>* within Europe</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i><b>Live animals transport</b></i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>Automobile <b>transportation of live animals is</b> carried out using specialized rolling stock.</i> <i><br></i> <br><br>  <b>4. Remember that you write the text primarily for people.</b> <br><br>  Of course, SEO copywriting doesn‚Äôt have much in common with high literature.  But still it is worth remembering that your goal is not only to use all key requests, but also to convince a site visitor that the text is written: <br><br>  * at least for a person, not only for search engines <br>  * Ideally - just for him.  In this case, he is more likely to turn from a site visitor to a client. <br><br>  Feel free to dilute dry SEO-optimized phrases with several sentences of ‚Äúlyrics‚Äù.  So, in the example discussed above, after the section ‚ÄúGeography of Live Animals Delivery‚Äù it will be appropriate to add a paragraph: <br><br>  <i>The presence of offices in Europe and the CIS countries and staff who speak English, German, French, Lithuanian and other European languages, allows the group of companies to quickly resolve all issues in the country of departure and in the country of destination.</i> <br><br>  That same ‚Äúlyrics‚Äù will help to get out of the situation if there are requirements in the TK for entering keywords for linking, when they should not stand next to each other. <br><br>  Splitting keywords can be, adding after each one or two sentences about what advantages this module gives, how it facilitates the life of the customer, etc.  Result: +1 to the list of fulfilled wishes of the SEO-specialist and +1 to the selling value of the text. <br><br>  <b>5. Focus - including visual - on the benefits for the client.</b> <br><br>  A frequently asked question by marketers is whether to put keywords in bold or in italics.  An experienced SEO specialist will probably smile here, imagining how colorful ‚Äúwell-optimized text‚Äù will be. <br><br>  Our advice - highlight the formatting in the text is not keywords (there is no need to attract them too much attention), but the advantages and benefits that the client will receive from working with you. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/114334/">https://habr.com/ru/post/114334/</a></p>
