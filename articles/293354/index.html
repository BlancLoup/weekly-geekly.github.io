      Such services analyze all available information: <br><ol><li>  user behavior on the site, </li><li>  viewed products </li><li>  order history </li><li>  information about him from social networks. </li></ol><br>  In this article we will consider the main use of recommender systems - <b>personal product recommendations</b> , as well as two cases of connecting a PC to an online store. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  There are also trigger e-mail newsletters, search personalization, and other technologies, which we will discuss in the following articles. <br><br><h3>  How it works </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/765/c79/95b/765c7995bbed425380418cd188156e52.png"><br><br>  So how do the PC widget define ‚Äúwho is who‚Äù? <br><br>  The fact is that the PC is connected to a large data system called BigData, where preferences, interests, and other various metrics of specific people are stored.  Identification occurs by tags recorded in the browser‚Äôs cookies. <br><br>  A new visitor on your site may have already visited other online stores before you, made purchases, looked through products, thus leaving a ‚Äútrace‚Äù behind them.  All his actions were saved in BigData under a special label, and this label was saved in the browser cookies.  Even if the user has once changed the browser, or has lost a cookie, it is possible to find it in BigData by some parameters of its equipment. <br><br><h3>  How does it look on the site </h3><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/0e8/ec3/21c/0e8ec321c1e046a2946a2bc32fd56764.png"><br><br>  <b>In the product card</b> in the <b>Similar goods</b> block there is a block of recommendations, which the system automatically deemed appropriate for the current product.  Thus, we do not have to independently indicate the relationship between the goods, the intellectual <b>system itself forms the connection</b> between the <b>goods</b> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/3da/d12/97f/3dad1297f2a04fd791a64f74870784ac.png"><br><br>  <b>On the main page</b> there is a <b>block of popular products</b> that are most often ordered from your online store. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/950/f4f/0d8/950f4f0d893f4d7b92a6d999167d3d69.png"><br><br>  <b>After placing the order</b> and moving to the cart, the system also generates <b>products</b> <b>suitable for the</b> buyer (you may also be interested in), which are also available for adding to the cart.  Thereby <b>increasing the average check</b> , by adding related products. <br><br><h3>  Product recommendations increase conversion in three main areas. </h3><br><ol><li>  Product recommendations <b>make</b> it <b>easier to navigate the site</b> and increase conversion. </li><li>  Product recommendations form cross-references to product cards, as well as <b>increase the depth of viewing the site</b> and the average <b>session duration</b> , which has a positive effect on positions in search engines. </li><li>  Product recommendations allow you <b>to sell more expensive products</b> or <b>related products</b> with the help of cross-sell and up-sell mechanics. </li></ol><br><br><h3>  Cases </h3><br><h4>  Shell Motor Oil Online Store </h4><br>  What has been done: the integration of product recommendations on the main page, in the item card, in the basket. <br><br>  Result: for the observation period (55 orders, 7 of which contained the recommended goods) about 6.6% of the money came from the service of product recommendations. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d9d/1fa/4b5/d9d1fa4b57804d759a8b32d5d75edca8.png"><br><br><h4>  Online store of adult goods 18iposle </h4><br>  What has been done: a block of popular products has been introduced on the main page, a block of recommended products in the product card. <br><br>  Result: exactly 50% of orders contained recommended goods, 26.3% of the money came from the recommendation service. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/982/1c0/24f/9821c024f2be4beea716ae919cd1f334.png"><br><br><h4>  Online consumer goods store starshop.kz </h4><br>  What has been done: a block of popular products is connected on the main page, a block of similar products is displayed in the product card, a block of goods that may interest a potential buyer is integrated into the shopping cart. <br><br>  Result: during the month of work, the increase in store revenue ranged from 30% to 50% (compared to the previous month).  An increase in the average check was also recorded. <br><br><h3>  Let's sum up </h3><br>  For the PC is definitely the future.  This is the WIN-WIN model, when we give the visitor exactly what he is looking for, of exactly that color and size, at the same time increasing profits from the business. <br><br>  For our part, we are ready to discuss the connection to the referral system, consultation and information support with the owners of online stores.
