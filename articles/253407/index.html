Reasonable criticism and wishes are welcomed with open arms.  If there is interest, I will write a series of articles on how the project was created, I will share a bit of my experience.  So, let's begin. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/cce/533/846/cce5338465d044a191cc125fc7f4e79b.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Recently, the idea came to create a fully open project of a universal 3-coordinate platform that can perform the functionality of both a 3d printer and a milling machine for plastic processing and much more.  The platform is built on a modular type.  This means that it fully interchangeable drive carriage movement and tool.  We called this thing "RRaptor Platform".  In the future, I will cite a number of images and photographs of the design models and what has already been implemented. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/0e5/df4/826/0e5df48267ef43768859cb8ff89f0e6c.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <i>But what happened in reality.</i>  <i>And yes.</i>  <i>The screw on the Y coordinate is not fixed</i>

      Let's see what modularity means in the context of a project.  For example, we want to get a 3d-printer: we put the appropriate drive + print unit (you can put 3 blocks at the same time) - and that's it.  We can print your Circuits.  For various reasons, gear-rail gears with a stepper motor are used for printing on the platform. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/549/116/9fa/5491169fa4024f43a8ac12077a048012.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <i>The model shows the installed gear-rack drive on the Y coordinate</i> <br><br>  Or we needed to mill something.  Then we install a screw-nut drive with a NEMA23 ball motor and a milling cutter.  Done!  We experimented with various screws.  Starting from the "collective farm", such as conventional studs and ending with high-quality ball screws.  It is possible to install on the platform of various types of screws.  Depends on the budget of the machine.  Versions of a milling spindle also vary from standard drills to our version of a small and compact spindle for milling plastic (which is still only at the drawing stage).  At the moment in our tests we use a drill on a 650W aluminum rack. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/1c3/5e1/71f/1c35e171fb004ce0b6da478a6d04da36.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <i>Here you have a plastic milling machine</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b7c/5bb/8ed/b7c5bb8edd93478db7fecc5ca9400583.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <i>It also develops</i> <br><br>  As mentioned above, we want to make the project open to third-party developers.  Put all the drawings and patents in open access, including software.  But more about that later. <br><br>  The next important component of the project is the control unit.  There is all the electronic filling.  Without going into details about what is there (as I have already said, there will be interest - I'll sign everything in separate articles), I will note its main feature.  This control unit can ‚Äústeer‚Äù several platforms at the same time.  This will create a small infrastructure of devices (or rather platforms) that perform various functions, centrally controlling them (probably speaking loudly, but still ...).  The unit is also modular.  Its filling varies.  You can add various communication interfaces: wi-fi, Bluetooth, ethernet, etc. What your heart desires. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/7b3/e59/6d0/7b3e596d0ab44a9ab81ac8dc8b51e60f.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <i>Photo of the control unit</i> <br><br>  Software is a separate epic.  We wrote it (and write) from scratch.  Absolutely everything, starting from the rotation algorithms with a small step, ending with an application on an android smartphone, is our job.  I do not say that we have come up with something innovative and new.  Although the key differences from analogs (for example, firmware Marlin) are.  I just want to emphasize that we took the project and the idea as a whole very seriously.  And, I hope that we can implement to the end.  Namely - mass production of such platforms. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a64/e51/223/a64e51223fef4af88c42d6511b4ddbaf.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <i>This is our first prototype.</i>  <i>Made on its base plotter for the very first tests</i> <br><br>  Although to mass production it is still necessary to grow and refine both the flaws in mechanics and in software.  Nevertheless, we already have some experience. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c11/509/2f4/c115092f44264c3b9ffb5735702ce3b1.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <i>The first series of 5 pieces</i> <br><br>  I hope (or rather, I am sure) your feedback, opinions and comments will help us.  Unfortunately, to describe and show many details of the project in one article is simply unrealistic.  But we have to start somewhere. <br><br>  Thanks for attention. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/253407/">https://habr.com/ru/post/253407/</a></p>
