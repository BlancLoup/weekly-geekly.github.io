  <section class="page js-page"><h1>State registration of computer programs</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Inspired by the <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/172307/">comment</a> .  For some reason, I thought that there shouldn't be such issues on Habr√©, for after reading a couple of times the relevant <a href="http://www1.fips.ru/wps/wcm/connect/content_ru/ru/documents/russian_laws/order_minobr/administrative_regulations/adm_regl_gos_reg_bd_evm/">Administrative Regulations</a> and other <s>boom</s> pages, everything becomes clear.  (You can read it once for general development, but, in principle, everything below is necessary, unless you have a unique and exotic case). <br>  In any case, I do not mind sharing my modest experience and telling how I had to deal with the state registration of a computer program (copyright holder - legal entity, 1 piece).  Nothing complicated, btv. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  State  registration is carried out by FGBU FIPS ( <a href="http://www1.fips.ru/wps/wcm/connect/content_ru/ru/">FGBU Federal Institute of Industrial Property</a> ) or simply FIPS. <br>  In the case of computer programs, registration does not require special gestures (as opposed to inventions, for example).  Is there a program?  - There is.  It remains only to <u>properly</u> fill out the package of documents, which is called the application. <br><br>  Application documents: <br>  1. Covering letter in 2 copies.  (in the case of sending the application documents by mail - in 1 copy.) <br>  2. Application in 1 copy. <br>  3. Printing the source code of the program in 1 copy. <br>  4. Abstract in 2 copies. <br>  5. Power of Attorney in 1 copy. <br>  6. Payment document on payment of state duty in 1 copy. <br>  Everything.  And now more detail about the design. <br><br><h3>  Transmittal letter </h3><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Instructions</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  <i>Cap.</i>  <i>It is printed in the upper right part of the letter, centered on the left edge.</i> <br><hr>  To the computer software registration department, <br>  databases and topologies of the IC of the Federal State Budgetary Institution "Federal Institute of Industrial Property" (FIPS)

Application (RP form) for 1 l.  in 1 copy. <br>  2. Addition to the application (RP / DOP form) for N <sub>1</sub> l.  in 1 copy. <br>  3.

Payment document (s) on the payment of state duty for N <sub>4</sub> l.  in 1 copy. <br><hr>  <i>A small sequel, do not forget about the red line.</i> <br><hr>  Total for the <i>sum of all sheets (and do not forget that the abstract is in 2 copies) minus N <sub>4</sub></i> sheets + <i>N <sub>4</sub></i> payment (x) document (s). <br><hr>  <i>Below we choose one of the options (do not forget about the red line).</i>  <i>Again, if you have the opportunity to pick up the certificate in person, it is better to use this opportunity, because ... because</i>  <i>post office.</i>  <i>There is even nothing to add.</i> <br><hr>  I ask you to send the certificate by mail to the address indicated in column 11 of the application (RP form). <br>  I ask you to hand out a certificate. <br><hr>  <i>Then (ideally in 2-3 lines) the signer should be: who is he (the seal, exciting ‚Äúwho is he‚Äù), the signature itself, the signature decryption and the date (the date is under the signature decoding, i.e. under I.O. Surname).</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Position, place to sign and decrypt the signature must be stretched on the sheet.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>The CEO may also be a Director.</i>  <i>Copyright Holder - for physical.</i>  <i>faces.</i>  <i>The representative of the copyright holder is the one to whom the power of attorney is issued (below will be about her).</i> <i><br></i>  <i>A little about printing.</i>  <i>Opinions about the rules of print design diverge.</i>  <i>My conclusions from the Internet read on the Internet: the seal should capture a piece of the post and not touch the signature.</i>  <i>Although ... FIPS is such a structure, I think they do not care.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>If your organization has a form of the head, then the seal is placed to the left of the signature from scratch.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Oh yeah, the letter should indicate the subject.</i>  <i>The topic is usually indicated under ... as it is called something ... under the patch of the form, where the registration number is affixed.</i>  <i>According to the rules known to me, the subject of the letter should begin with ‚ÄúAbout ...‚Äù, for example, About the state registration of a computer program.</i> <br><hr>  Director General ___________ I.O.

I didn‚Äôt have to check how much he should or shouldn‚Äôt, and I don‚Äôt advise you either. <br>  If you are going to do business by mail, the letter is sent in 1 copy.  If you have the opportunity to take the application documents to FIPS with legs, I advise you to use this opportunity. <br>  It is also possible to submit documents to FIPS via e-mail or fax, but later all the same (for a period of time) you must provide original documents (since I didn‚Äôt have to do this, I can only advise you to look for this information on the FIPS website). <br><br>  Letters are signed by the head, put a stamp, register. <br><br><h3>  Statement </h3><br>  <a href="http://www1.fips.ru/wps/wcm/connect/content_ru/ru/soft/oba_za">Sample applications and examples of their completion.</a> <br>  The application is printed on 1 sheet from two sides.

In this case, they will also prompt you on the spot what is wrong (the FIPS officer accepts the documents, takes you into the room, checks the documents, and affix the application number).</font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Pay attention if your organization is related to the Ministry of Defense, Rosatom, Roskosmos, etc. (or the computer program is created under an agreement with similar organizations), you will most likely be asked for a piece of paper confirming that your computer program does not contain state the secret.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Try to keep your documents in order, because the request for FIPS employees is given 2 months, and more often they still wait for the deadline to expire to send the request to the applicant. I have been waiting for my request for about 25 working days, and I need to respond to the request 4 months after it was sent by the FIPS employee, so I‚Äôve only got about 3 months to answer it. Although, for some it may not be a particular problem But there may be cases when the remaining time may not be enough to collect the missing materials, or it is necessary to arrange the state as soon as possible. registration, and then the post of Russia + zealous staff of FIPS.</font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In my opinion, you can submit a petition to extend the deadline for submission of materials at the request of the FIPS officer (whether it is paid or not, not up to date). The occurrence of such cases (the need to extend the deadlines) is unlikely, so I would advise anyone to inquire (do not throw slippers) to call the FIPS directly or check with the receiving employee on the spot. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">About signatures. If the documents will be signed not by the head of the organization, but by some of his deputies, then it is necessary to provide a document confirming such powers of the deputy (a copy of the Charter or Power of Attorney). But, in theory, such documents are also certified by the head, so that horseradish radish is not sweeter.</font></font><br><br>  <b>Important:</b> <br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- note that the name of the computer should be the same in all documents! </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- if the owners are two or more legal entities. persons, then (according to the instruction on duties) each jur. the person pays his own share of the duty, and no perversions and approaches here will save; </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- even in the requirements for the design of materials it is written that the volume of them, </font></font><u><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">as a rule</font></font></u><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> , is 70 pages, the FIPS officer assured me that with a larger volume of pages, the application will not be accepted (even with a justification attached, why do I consider submit for state registration).
