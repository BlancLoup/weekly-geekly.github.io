  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How we decided to build CosmoZoo</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  As a responsible pet owner (I have a dog and a guinea pig), I have to take care of them for some time ‚Äî buying food, visiting veterinarians and a dog handler, buying toys, visiting a club, vaccinations, and much more.  Moreover, at some point I was faced with the fact that not every veterinarian can solve the problems of guinea pigs (they are considered exotic animals) and I learned about the existence of rodent specialists - ratologists.  Visiting various veterinary clinics, I was faced with the fact that they all live apart, mostly professional communications take place within network clinics, and also - you are limited in information that you can transfer from one clinic doctor to another doctor of clinic B. Maximum to what You will have access to a brief extract and a prescription required for the purchase of medicines.  Of course - very few people are satisfied with this and we decided to solve this problem. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The result was the <a href="http://cosmozoo.co/">CosmoZoo</a> platform <a href="http://cosmozoo.co/">(http://cosmozoo.co)</a> .  Many who were born in the late 70s and early 80s of the last century will surely remember the writer Cyrus Bulychev, who presented Alice Seleznev to his readers, whose father, Professor Igor Seleznyov was the director of the Moscow Space Zoo, Kosmozo.  And it is these kind, slightly naive children's books that gave the name to our project and I very much hope that they will remind you that we must be ready for pleasant discoveries and interesting adventures, which, in addition to the daily routine, await us in this world. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/280/e6f/ba9/280e6fba960ee7605d5ce5ef3779e256.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  First of all, we decided to help vet clinics and give them tools for communication with customers, as well as to make an electronic medical card (EHR) for the animal common to all.  At once I will say that the issue of general EHR for clinics is very painful, since any medical error will be permanently preserved in history and can be used by competitors as an attempt at unfair competition.  Also, many doctors are afraid that the data in medical records may cause an outflow of clients from them in favor of competitors.  Well, the challenge accepted and our task pool had to write down the need to clarify that the client still chooses the CAM doctor and clinic with which to work, and the treatment history of animals is unlikely to affect his choice, rather the feedback from former patients. <br>  For development, I brought in several of my colleagues from the <a href="http://progress-engine.com/">Progress Engine</a> .  We have formed a group of works on the first stage, with which we can go to our users and partners, I will tell you a little about them.

    <h2>  Front office for clients </h2><br>  One of the first tasks was to ensure high conversion of the leads.  Initially, we implemented standard functionality - email / password authentication and social networks - Facebook, vKontakte, Twitter, Google.  But at some point we realized that one of the main means of communication would be mobile communication, and also that on mobile devices it is easier to get a text message with a password - we changed the strategy and left only phone number authentication. <br>  Another thing that we noticed is the ability to create family accounts.  If you are a proud user of apple devices and if you are even more proud family man, and even more so - a parent, then you probably noticed the presence of family accounts in the system, when purchasing applications, music or any other content - all members acquire access to it. families.  We decided that starting a pet - all family members are responsible for it and, accordingly, any spouse, a child, a relative or someone else can go with him.  We decided to make access to pet data for each family member, with each family having a chapter that is responsible for all organizational and financial issues. <br><br>  In principle, all the functionality is quite logical and transparent.  This is the ability to add and delete pets, mark them as lost (more on that later), sign up at the clinic, and also is such a handy thing as reminders.  Each animal requires attentive care, especially if it is a purebred animal.  For example, I learned that for a chihuahua dog it is very important that at the age of 1 year her fangs were replaced by indigenous ones, so if the teeth have not changed, then you should visit the vet, otherwise there will be an overbite.  So that the owners of animals did not miss this or that problem, we decided to create a reminder system.  Also, reminders from veterinaries can get into it, so as not to miss vaccinations and geo-targeted reminders, such as the need to buy a tick collar in case of, for example, an encephalitis epidemic in a certain location. <br><br>  The next problem that pet owners often face, especially during the New Year holidays, when dogs get scared of fireworks - is the loss of animals.  I regularly see in the facebook feed that someone of my friends lost a dog during a walk, and to be honest - not even dare to imagine what it would be like if our dog ran away.  I have seen a number of communities and sites whose members regularly publish information about lost and found animals, and I want to believe that most people and animals re-find each other.  We decided to approach this task a little more technologically and made informing people who lost and found animals based on a number of criteria, such as animal type, date, geo-location, approximate color match, etc.  All parameters have their weight and ads that have more weight are shown above all others.  In fact - we even started thinking about computer vision and neural networks to implement a more accurate search in the future, but for the time being it is too early to talk about it :) <br><br><h2>  Back Office for doctors and clinic administrators </h2><br>  It's all pretty prosaic.  In each clinic there are doctors and administrators who decide organizational issues.  There is a dashboard with applications, there is an opportunity to work with an EHR - all that, oh, it was already written above.  But there are certain features that you want to talk about. <br>  Firstly, in order to save veterinarians from the fear that someone would ring up their clients, we allowed access only to those user profiles who came to the clinic and gave their phone number (mobile).  That is, if someone suddenly appears who decides to lure a competitor‚Äôs customers through telephone calls or advertising, he will have to sweat to get numbers for telephone calls. <br><br>  Secondly, doctors have the opportunity to log all clinic visits (even if a person doesn‚Äôt have an account on the platform yet) based on the visitor‚Äôs phone number, so when the user finally decides to register, he will have access to the entire treatment history of his pet. . <br>  So, I talked about the main functions of the platform, and now a few words about what to expect in the near future. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a6e/eb7/3e9/a6eeb73e911acf057157ee079c5b942a.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  1. Mobile customers.  This is probably one of the highest priority project tasks.  Now it is difficult to imagine a high-tech project without a mobile client, moreover - mobile applications provide more personal interaction with the user.  On the smartphone screen, it‚Äôs harder to miss the notice that you need to scratch the cat behind the ear than in the browser window, so we still count on justifying the trust of users in caring for their pets :) <br><br>  2. API for developers.  And here there will already be an opportunity to turn around in the full talents of developers and build a whole ecosystem around the platform that will solve more and more problems for users, and also allow them to offer them new services, starting from the needs of their animals. <br><br>  3. Retail - feed and pet products.  Another stage in the development of the platform is the offer of relevant goods for pets, of course, with delivery at a convenient time for the owners.  We already have several retailer partners who are eagerly awaiting this functionality, but we are always ready for new friends in different parts of the world. <br><br>  4. The ability to pay with an attached card.  I think - there will be no comments here :) <br><br>  5. Analytics.  Not exactly the nearest, but still the future.  We plan to provide access to analytical information for scientific organizations and independent researchers in order to improve the quality of feed, the safety of medicines, and of course, the most important thing is the health of your pets. <br><br>  This and much more will appear in the upcoming platform releases.  We have a lot of ideas, but of course we want to hear our users.  In addition to comments on this post, which I will gladly try to answer - I will be happy to answer your letters at <a href="">alexey.poimtsev@cosmozoo.co</a> <br><br>  <a href="https://medium.com/cosmozoo/%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BA-%25D0%25BC%25D1%258B-%25D1%2580%25D0%25B5%25D1%2588%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B8-%25D0%25BF%25D0%25BE%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B8%25D1%2582%25D1%258C-%25D0%25BA%25D0%25BE%25D1%2581%25D0%25BC%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B7%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BE-67adef4d8890">Original article</a> <br><br>  PS: The platform is in the public testing mode + contracts are concluded with veterinary clinics and other partners.  Therefore, I ask you to be merciless to bugs and jambs, but at the same time understand that everything will be fixed soon thanks to your comments :) Well, I will be happy to hear any criticism. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/333500/">https://habr.com/ru/post/333500/</a></p>
