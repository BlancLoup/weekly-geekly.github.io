After reading, it becomes clear that the driver needs to be downloaded from the network, and the device itself only works with them (I decided to read the help after I had unsuccessfully poked the gadget into the USB port).

      <b>Download, install.</b>  <b>Hooked up.</b>  <b>It worked.</b>  <b>New, unusual, cool!</b> <br><br>  Now it will be easier and faster for me to tell first about the appearance of the device, and only then about the program part. <br><br>  So, Optimus Mini Three is a device the size of a mobile phone, with a USB cable sticking out of one end of it.  When installing firewood and when connected to a PC, three buttons light up on this device itself.  The raisin is that these three buttons are also OLED-displays, the resolution of which is 96x96 pixels (the same as, for example, in Siemens C65).  The screens do not just burn - various information is displayed on them, depending on the settings. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/ee4/3e6/d8d/ee43e6d8d360aecd18aae1d169acbcec.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/09f/30b/5c5/09f30b5c5710e5e5474606a2c408a9a8.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Plastic is pleasant enough for hands, on the bottom there are two rubber inserts that are even more pleasant to touch. In general, the device does not slip with them.  Collected like conscience, no squeaks. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/325/2ec/fd5/3252ecfd547ab6107fef16cd6e0fb1c4.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/53f/529/01c/53f52901c5a9b604ff77192a3570bc70.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  What I liked is that the key is pressed even if you press its very corner.  It would be much worse if the keys were stitched when pressed not in the center. <br><br>  Enough to press the buttons, I decided to do a more thorough study of the possibilities.  So, about the software - about the configurator. <br><br>  <b>The distribution itself weighs 2.2 megabytes, after installation - 5.2 MB.</b>  <b>Eats programm neither more nor less than about 30 meters!</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/59f/039/fc8/59f039fc80a36845b425d4d90519be5b.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Another icon appears in the tray - there is practically nothing to confuse it with, except with <b>USB Safely Remove</b> . <br><br>  Now tell you what raisins.  So, looking at the main window of the program, you can see three main fields - <b>Layouts</b> (Layouts), <b>Available Plugins</b> (Available modules) and <b>a viewport</b> . <br><br>  Initially, the <b>Global</b> layout was chosen - what is shown when something specific is not shown. Well ... let's say you just have a desktop before your eyes - you can display the launch of the ICQ, the song being played in the player and, say, the computer lock.  These icons are selected from the ‚ÄúAvailable modules‚Äù, dragging them into the viewing window and they will always burn. <br><br>  But it is worth pressing some key - <b>Ctrl</b> , <b>Alt</b> , <b>Shift</b> , <b>Alt + Shift</b> or <b>Ctrl + Shift</b> - how these icons will change to others.  Those.  it turns out that one modifier key (or their combination) has three possible functions, not counting the three default functions.  <b>In other words, only one layout can hang 3 + (3 * 5) = 18 functions!</b>  That's enough for most programs. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/ac1/513/40f/ac151340fb48a55dbaf5eca85f61b0a2.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Speaking of programs.  Initially, the configurator is configured so that the keyboard displays the functions assigned to a specific application.  It turns out that you can add as many programs as you like, assign up to 18 functions to each, and you are guaranteed not to lose yourself during work, since each function has its own picture. <br><br>  Of the available modules, in principle, has everything you need - work with files, clipboard, hot keys.  Lock, system information, lock.  Manage your player, Skype, office applications.  Well, all sorts of informers - weather, mail on gmail, news feeds. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/4c3/631/a29/4c3631a290538e305f9f93e6224a167f.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/b51/02e/6e2/b5102e6e2664940ffc58110f7ae8c440.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/296/03c/af4/29603caf4e0ea5aba622b26329e728c5.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Principle, everything is more than well done, but there was a lot of tar - read on. <br><br>  You can display not only static information, but also a simple animation. <br>  An interesting opportunity is to add the website address to the button, while it is not necessary to draw an icon - the program will load the website itself in the window and you can select an arbitrary area. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/e03/7f9/85a/e037f985a151db38fa2d8b2953f74178.png" alt="image"><br><br>  But here he also hid a minus - you cannot assign an arbitrary picture - you have to make an informer. <br><br>  When creating an informer, everything is not smooth either - you can only upload an image from an Internet button. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/163/a87/0eb/163a870eb2d57e59f3a4a14380c917f4.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Local images can only be uploaded to the AFOF module (Application, file or folder). <br><br>  About two weeks everything works without errors, pah-pah-pah.  However, the program you can <a href="http://www.artlebedev.ru/everything/optimus-mini/downloads/">download</a> and potestit without a keyboard - to understand what I mean. <br><br><h3>  Keyboard Cons </h3>  : - [ <br><h3>  Check weighing </h3><br>  I think the most important advantage is that the program can really embellish the grayness of computer everyday life very well - there are practically no limitations in configuration.  Everything is thought out and done conscientiously, but as you know, there is no perfection. <br><br>  The device is the first and unique of its kind, which probably hides most of its shortcomings.  If there was some kind of competing device of this type, there would be nothing to compare with.  The first pancake is always so good. <br><br>  In the meantime, this is a really interesting keyboard, simple and functional - anyone could find a use for it.  Only positive impressions remain.  <b>I think that Theme again worked on "Excellent</b> . <b>"</b> <br><br>  Can be used as a universal gift.  And you can as a remote control <br><br>  Soon there will be a review of the keyboard <b>Optimus Maximus</b> ;) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/084/237/5a9/0842375a90cec2338758d7fbbac9876b.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>Successes!</b> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/44248/">https://habr.com/ru/post/44248/</a></p>
