How appropriate is such a union and whether the functionality has affected the quality?  Details below. <br><br> <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/mvideo/blog/287228/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/46c/9c2/096/46c9c2096addeb02857525feb0b0530d.jpg"></a> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Wireless multimedia speakers so much that they can compete in their number with covers for the iPhone.  On the shelves mass devices of all possible colors, shapes, sizes and origin.  But the grandees of the acoustic industry are not in the mood to produce "plastic rattles", and if JBL decided to enter this market, then its product must fundamentally surpass its competitors.  For example, in the field of application.  The company is positioning <a href="http://www.mvideo.ru/products/avtomobilnyi-aksessuar-jbl-trip-10009881">JPL Trip</a> primarily as a car gadget with its design features.  Let's start with them. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#ec2028">Design</font> </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/e4a/4b1/a14/e4a4b1a14b4f12e5f79b1279a778f017.jpg">

      <a href="http://www.mvideo.ru/products/avtomobilnyi-aksessuar-jbl-trip-10009881">JBL Trip</a> is a portable speaker system with a built-in microphone and a Bluetooth 3.0 module that consumes much less power than its predecessor 2.0.  The device is moderately compact, unlike most competitors JBL is clearly not chasing the thickness of the case.  And there are two rational explanations for this. <br><br>  First, the larger the internal volume, the more comfortable and fuller the sound.  Secondly, a large battery can be placed in a large case.  The Trip has a 1200 mAh battery installed.  According to the manufacturer, when working in the wireless headset mode, the charge lasts almost 800 hours, with continuous conversation for 20 hours, and you can use JBL Trip as a column without stopping for 8-10 hours.  To fully charge the gadget, it takes two to four hours.  In practice, we did not find any discrepancies with the manufacturer‚Äôs numbers. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/414/80d/171/41480d171146a7b219f6906fa1b928ac.jpg"><br><br>  The case has a rounded shape with a metal protective mesh in front of the speaker.  The surface "soft touch" creates a feeling of comfort and integrity of the device and prevents slipping.  The microUSB connector on the side of the gadget allows you to charge it from the nearest phone charging. <br>  As if confirming her ‚Äúmusical‚Äù roots, JBL equipped Trip with a non-switchable soundtrack: each guitar has its own guitar riff. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#ec2028">Work in the car</font> </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/8c5/504/0f1/8c55040f14403dfd7eea1f63de9cf9ab.jpg"><br><br>  Included with the JBL Trip is a metal spring clip that attaches to the sun visor in the car and holds the column at the top with two powerful magnets. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/449/dc3/1d1/449dc31d1a24a19bc79cf4d5e4fc2915.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/60f/105/aa4/60f105aa49b01aaf62104f108a3bfd4b.jpg"><br><br>  The user may have a fear that such a mount is unreliable and with a strong shaking the gadget will simply fall.  But it is not.  Magnets firmly hold the column on the visor, and a safety hook-hook does not allow him to crawl on the mount.  To remove the device, you need to make a little effort, but this can be easily done with one hand. <br><br>  The speaker is located almost over the driver's head - it is very convenient for talking at the wheel.  Audibility is excellent, the interlocutors do not have to re-ask each other: a proprietary noise reduction system effectively cuts off external road noise falling into the microphone. <br><br>  In addition to calls, all the sounds of a smartphone can be output to the headset, including the voice prompts of the navigator - they can be heard much better than through the speaker of a smartphone. <br>  In the car, the gadget is best kept charged - the wire hanging from the cigarette lighter creates a certain discomfort along the way.  Another drawback: the visor with a column attached to it will not work tightly against the windshield - for example, to protect from the sun.  But who prevents to remove the device for this time and put it under glass or in any other convenient place?  Fortunately, the body with non-slip coating allows you to do this without fear that the acoustics will roll on a plastic surface. <br><br>  Control of the device during movement does not cause any discomfort.  The only point is that in order not to confuse the call answer and call voice assistant buttons, sometimes you need to take a quick look at the control panel. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#ec2028">Multimedia speaker system</font> </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/50b/3e1/05d/50b3e105d0e8a35bcfc3c875f1e0f8ec.jpg"><br><br>  JBL Trip is suitable for traveling not only as a headset for cars.  This gadget can safely take with you on a picnic, the beach or attach to the bike.  A clip for the visor turns into a universal mount or desktop stand. <br><br>  The power of the speaker is quite enough to create some musical comfort around you on the beach or in the recreation area, without disturbing the others.  Yes, there will not be deep bass - physics can not be fooled.  No surround sound, as it is mono.  But the available frequency range is reproduced at a decent level, legible and balanced. <br><br>  It feels like a long-stroke speaker is installed inside, which very diligently works out the lower limit of 160 Hz available to it.  That is, the column ‚Äúpumps‚Äù the air perceptibly, as a result of which a deep bass effect is created.  The 3.2 watt amp is pretty good.  Of course, this is not a disco - but quite a decent musical background.  True, the lack of stereo and the ability to control playback from the speaker itself creates a certain discomfort.  But this is a fee for portability and versatility. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#ec2028">Control</font> </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/252/5c6/7bd/2525c67bd5e8336f32b608288a487141.jpg"><br><br>  The gadget is initially focused on the use of "driving", so the main control of his touch.  It is really convenient, does not distract from driving.  The volume buttons are spaced around the edges, and in the center is the answer to the call and call to voice control.  The last button allows you to use Google and Apple voice services. <br><br>  The volume can also be controlled from a smartphone - the adjustment systems are synchronized, they do not need to be adjusted to each other.  When you turn off the speakers, the volume on the smartphone remains at the level that was chosen when working together. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/aaf/7e2/fa3/aaf7e2fa37a01beea78acf3ca594e3df.jpg"><br>  Side buttons off and pairing with Bluetooth mechanical.  In this case, the first has two functions.  Holding it, you can turn the device on or off.  A short press allows you to lock the touch buttons so that, for example, you do not accidentally press them when carrying the device. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#ec2028">What is the result?</font> </h2><br>  JBL managed to create a universal gadget that can be used with equal success as a wireless headset and portable speaker.  Thanks to a proprietary noise reduction system and high quality for a compact device, you can comfortably talk on the phone, as well as listen to music or navigator prompts on the road.  In this case, a capacious battery allows you to use the speaker outdoors or the car, without worrying about charging.  And the clip helps to fix the device where it is needed by the user.  <a href="http://www.mvideo.ru/products/avtomobilnyi-aksessuar-jbl-trip-10009881">Great gadget</a> for avid drivers, travelers, music lovers and those who do not like to relax in silence <img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/fa7/d16/199/fa7d16199fca4fee89c0b96fa9919513.png"></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/402567/">https://habr.com/ru/post/402567/</a></p>
