  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Forrester Review: The Rise and Fall of Information Security Technologies</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The popularity of individual information security technologies is growing and decreasing.  Forrester Research, in its report, TechRadar bets on 5 technologies that are in the growth stage, and 5 that, in their opinion, are dying off. <br><br>  Below are 5 technologies whose popularity, according to Forrester analysts, will grow in the coming years: <br><br>  <b>1. Audit change tools</b> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  According to a Forrester study, there are not too many implementations of audit change tools, but in three to five years they will be widely used due to the increasing number of data leaks.  In many ways, the growth of the popularity of such tools contributes to the emergence of standards for information security.  Therefore, a massive introduction of such solutions is expected in the near future.

        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>

          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      <b>2. Malware Analysis</b> <br>  The fact that such an analysis is used in incident response and vulnerability management is evidence that in the near future (3-5 years), the adoption of such tools by companies is expected to increase.  In particular, this is due to the fact that a more thorough analysis of network traffic is required due to persistent threats. <br><br>  <b>3. Network encryption</b> <br>  Although network encryption functions are present in IT infrastructure devices such as routers and switches, Forrester notes that due to the numerous requirements of information security standards, in particular data encryption and data protection, demand for individual applications is only emerging.  After one or three years, this area we can see qualitative changes in this area (new stage of development), although without pressure from the regulatory authorities this technology will be introduced only by large organizations, Forrester believes. <br><br>  <b>4. Intelligent threat modeling</b> <br>  This relatively new concept calls for analyzing how to properly protect sensitive data through proactive threat modeling.  After 3-5 years, the next stage of technology development may come, although the costs and complexity of the currently available threat modeling tools create a barrier to adapting this new technology. ‚Äù <br><br>  <b>5. Control of mitigation of DDoS-attacks (DDoS mitigation controls)</b> <br>  Although there are anti-DDoS solutions on the market, Forrester indicates that this market was extremely small until recently.  However, due to the growth of hacking (hacktivism - in the terminology used by Forrester), the market for solutions that provide protection against DDoS attacks will grow within a year - three years.  Especially fast this growth will be in the form of a SaaS model. <br><br>  But the technology that, according to Forrester, threatens to die out in the coming years. <br><br>  <b>1. Network Access Control</b> <br>  According to Forrester, the market for individual offers to control network access will disappear over the next 5-10 years.  (Although it may exist as a module in information security software packages or infrastructure security solutions).  Why is this bad news for network access control developers?  According to Forrester, only 10% of information technology decision makers will implement them in the next 12 months, because these decisions are ‚Äúdifficult to deploy, scale, and manage‚Äù.  There are several NAC architectures on the market that must be integrated with components of the network infrastructure (including software and hardware).  Such solutions, however, will not stop the insider, who set out to organize the leakage of data for financial or other reasons. <br><br>  <b>2. Applications for secure data transmission</b> <br>  The need for secure data transfer and file sharing between business partners is, of course, high, but in the next 3-5 years it will all be done through cloud services, not applications. So the need for such applications will disappear. <br><br>  <b>3. Solutions for Unified Threat Management (UTM)</b> <br>  Although such solutions are widely implemented in small offices as well as in branch offices, the unified threat management technology itself faces the fact that focus is shifting to new security gateways with more integrated firewalls and intrusion detection functions.  All this makes UTM technology look obsolete.  According to Forrester, such solutions have from one to three years to evolve and meet competitive challenges.  It is also necessary that these solutions be pre-prepared for companies.  Although it is also recognized that UTM will be popular for a long time in retail implementation. <br>  The importance of the following two technologies will gradually decrease. <br><br>  <b>4. Traditional network firewall</b> <br>  The traditional firewall market is stagnating as a result of the widespread adoption of new-generation firewalls.  The research company predicts that in the next 5-10 years, new-generation firewalls will replace today's traditional firewalls.  Although the latter will remain as the main line of cyber defense for at least 5 years. <br><br>  <b>5. Preventing network intrusion (individual solutions)</b> <br>  Forrester believes that the market for individual intrusion prevention systems (IPS), despite its success in implementation in the world's largest companies, is in a recession stage and will disappear within 5-10 years.  Instead, there will be new multifunctional gateways and firewalls (especially new generation firewalls), which will include IPS and will use instead of separate IPS equipment. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/144185/">https://habr.com/ru/post/144185/</a></p>
