This brand has gained fame thanks to navigators, it also had (and is) DVRs, readers, routers, tablets ... The first Lexand smartphone was released in May 2013 ( <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/smartgadget/blog/184908/">here</a> you can read its review), and in early autumn it added another "Brood" of such devices.  Lexand Vega - the most inexpensive of them, the model is estimated at approximately 3,800 rubles.  Let's see what we are offered for this money ... <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/6d3/707/5ef/6d37075efb78c9148e59a802cf09b20b.jpg"><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  The delivery package is standard: the smartphone itself, a USB-microUSB lanyard, a charger unit, headphones, a brief user manual and a warranty card.

      Assembled Lexand Vega carefully, failed to stray.  Smartphone looks quite unusual.  The first thing I noticed is the lack of touch-sensitive keys for controlling Android functions under the screen.  Although starting from the fourth version of the mentioned OS they are an optional element, the overwhelming majority of developers use them.  They are absent in Lexand Vega, and I personally don‚Äôt like it very much - I‚Äôm just used to physical buttons.  But there is a ‚Äúkeyless‚Äù approach and an advantage: Vega resembles a diminished LG Nexus 4. I heard this statement from two people.  I do not see a phenomenal resemblance, but yes, something trimmed can be traced. <br><br>  Also on the front of the Lexand Vega are a conversational speaker, covered with a mesh, proximity and illumination sensors, a 1.3 megapixel front camera.  For Skype and crossbows, its capabilities are enough, and more from such matrices no one requires. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/133/de9/516/133de95163fbb0a26b8bbbf67825af5e.jpg"><br><br>  The back of the smartphone, which in combination is the battery cover, is made of rubberized plastic.  The material is quite practical: firstly, it does not slip in his hands;  secondly, it is not easily soiled;  thirdly, if you put a shallow scratch on the back panel, it will hardly be visible.  At the bottom of the back side of the device is the speaker, in the center is the inscription Lexand, and at the top is the main camera lens and LED flash. <br><br>  Under the back panel is the battery capacity of 1450 mAh.  By today's standards it is not very much, but Lexand Vega shows a good battery life - about two days in average operation with calls, social networks and mail, but without video.  Also under the cover there are two compartments for SIM-cards and a memory expansion slot for microSD cards. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/3eb/2c7/c00/3eb2c7c000198493a4cb263be2c15af1.jpg"><br><br>  The ends of the Lexand Vega edging silver frame.  Controls and connectors are located as usual.  The screen lock key is on the right side of the upper end, next to it is a 3.5 mm jack for connecting headphones or a headset.  The volume rocker is on the left side, while the right side is empty.  Connector microUSB developers placed on the bottom.  In general, the smartphone fits well in the hand, I have not identified problems with ergonomics. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/3b5/2ad/632/3b52ad632faf2a32552d57f0b0231c7a.jpg"><br><br>  Let's go to the screen.  It is clear that a smartphone with a price below 4 thousand rubles is unlikely to install an IPS-matrix.  Here in Lexand Vega and used the display, made by technology TFT-TN, its diagonal is 4 inches, and resolution - 800 x 480 pixels.  The screen has a high brightness, but with viewing angles things are much worse, they are not as wide as we would like.  In general, the display is not bad, the weak part of Lexand Vega cannot be called precisely. <br><br>  Also, the weak can not be called and "iron¬ª Lexand Vega.  It uses a dual-core 1.2-GHz processor MediaTek MT6572 with two processing cores (ARM Cortex-A7, 28 nanometers).  There is also an old graphics core Mali-400MP and 512 MB of RAM.  Yes, the "RAM" is frankly not enough, but still it is enough to ensure a good interface performance and application launch.  In principle, on this unit, even playing games will turn out without difficulty (heavy 3D-toys do not count).  Here are the results of synthetic tests: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e6d/d65/88c/e6dd6588c34ff68a8dec39daeae4395d.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/802/d12/3c5/802d123c510fcb2fbb64b484b2780b21.png"><br><br>  The amount of built-in flash memory is 4 GB, from which the user can access a little more than 2 GB.  I have already mentioned the support for memory cards, so there‚Äôs no need to worry about the lack of space.  A set of wireless adapters is quite familiar to the modern Android smartphone - it is Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, GPS, 3G and FM receiver.  Plus, the smartphone supports the work of two SIM-cards. <br><br>  The version of the operating system Lexand Vega is quite fresh - Android 4.2.2.  It has not yet received, and some much more expensive devices.  The interface can be called standard, with the exception of a few changes.  For example, these are icons in the smartphone settings; they are not dull black and white, but colored.  Also, the camera interface has undergone a slight change. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e23/0a0/a5a/e230a0a5acaa85684ee4e80cb8bfeaea.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d58/79b/215/d5879b2159a2b2a70b0bfc57a3718926.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/591/f5c/cee/591f5cceec7d4feb9d4b401215f8d13b.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/62a/956/590/62a956590221019a5659967b2d9ef53e.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e77/d62/295/e77d6229561bf4da831821d597a2420f.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/606/278/f0d/606278f0d6e3af991c974c7f19746e00.png"><br><br>  It is worth noting a fairly large number of applications preinstalled in Lexand Vega.  By the way, among them is the demo version of the Navitel navigation program.  In principle, it is not surprising, because the main profile of the Lexand brand is car navigators. <br><br>  By the way, about the camera, its resolution - only 3.2 megapixels, there is no auto focus function.  In general, it is clear that the quality of the pictures is mediocre and even more, you can evaluate it yourself below.  Video Lexand Vega writes in the maximum resolution HD720p. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/454/d8b/b0b/454d8bb0b723f246dc55b13053a4df0b.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e6d/1cf/fb5/e6d1cffb5bd5069c29b6599efdcaae74.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a90/5fb/bd6/a905fbbd672661e24807615544219ce7.jpg"><br><br>  To summarize, and for greater clarity I will determine the pros and cons of a smartphone.  Pros: productive and economical "iron", good build quality, the latest version of the operating system (Android 4.2.2), price.  Cons: weak camera, not enough RAM.  For the price of 3,800 rubles, the smartphone is OK, it is not bad.  If only he would have a better camera, otherwise the existing 3.2 megapixel module is not very good even for taking pictures for social networks. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/204184/">https://habr.com/ru/post/204184/</a></p>
