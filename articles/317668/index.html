  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Virtual keys to the real world</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Imagine that you have a convenient opportunity to ensure safe and convenient sharing of a car without having to physically hand over the keys to it.  With the growing popularity of virtual key technology, when information about car access rights along with other data is stored in the cloud, this becomes quite real, and the development of this technology can not only simplify car sharing, but also significantly affect the business of rental companies around the world . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ba8/afe/e97/ba8afee9782f48f687f4f2b5d8e3e7cb.jpg" width="100%"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Thanks to the Valeo InBlue technology, which is based on the Gemalto Allynis Trusted Services Hub solution, you can now access your car from a smartphone or smart watch.  The Valeo InBlue solution is presented on Android and iOS platforms and allows you to start and jam a car, as well as manage various applications and view current data from various on-board systems using on-board equipment tied to the Smartphone Development Kit (SDK), while the virtual car key is placed in the cloud. <br><br>  And now let us imagine what the very possibility of the safe transmission by air of identification data and the corresponding rights for car sharing, whether within the family or among a wider circle of people, means.  The technology allows you to transfer a secured digital key to someone without having to meet in person with these individuals.  You can easily and simply book a car using your mobile phone, get all the necessary information about its location and fuel availability in the gas tank, as well as get secure virtual keys to it.  Such a solution will be in demand not only in the family, for example, allowing parents to provide a family car to a nanny or children in their absence, but also be able to change the business model of rental companies, providing them with new opportunities for more efficient management of their fleet of cars.

      For example, as the Observatoire Cetelem study shows, more than 40% of Europeans are planning to share cars in the coming years, and already more than 3.5 million belong to various car-sharing clubs, providing more than 70 thousand cars worldwide. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ea8/506/19f/ea850619f3dc438a98050630708308d8.jpg" width="100%"><br><br>  In addition, this technology allows you to remotely manage driver profiles, setting restrictions in relation to their driver's licenses.  For example, if the system sees that the driver has just passed the exam and obtained the rights, then she can set a limit on the allowed speed limit for this car, as a result of which the driving will be safer.  In addition, the driver's profile can be tied to restrictions on the geography of movement or the time of driving, thus avoiding abuses that could lead to an accident.  The introduction or restoration of such restrictions (which, for example, existed in Russia before 1991) often faces precisely the difficulty of monitoring their implementation. <br><br>  However, for the fullest possible realization of the full potential of virtual keys, it is necessary to build a robust security architecture that would protect the credentials transmitted over the air and stored on mobile devices.  Car thieves, taking advantage of such technological vulnerabilities, could cause significant damage to brands, not to mention the owners of cars;  their actions could cost a lot of money to project participants and lead to the discrediting of the very idea of ‚Äã‚Äãvirtual keys among consumers.  Given that modern attackers are constantly adapting to the new picture of the world, manufacturers have to remember that access to a car with a virtual key has the same value as the car itself.  Accordingly, appropriate cybersecurity solutions must be used to ensure the secure transfer of virtual keys and that only authorized users have access to valuable information. <br><br>  The Gemalto's Allynis Trusted Security Hub security hub ( <a href="http://www.gemalto.com/mobile/mcommerce/mfs/trusted-service-hub">Eng.</a> ), Used in particular in the Valeo InBlue solution, provides the ability to securely deploy in Over-The-Air mode and manage the lifecycle of applications and critical data when working with a car.  As a result, virtual car keys can be securely transferred to smartphones and stored there, while ensuring a high level of security comparable to that achieved in modern mobile payment solutions implemented by banks around the world, where Gemalto also has considerable experience . <br><br>  Obviously, the development of virtual keys from cars and the <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/gemaltorussia/blog/281619/">Internet of Things (IoT)</a> opens up new opportunities for a wide variety of market sectors.  Indeed, there is a huge number of new services that can significantly grow thanks to this technology.  Delivery services can use it to leave parcels in the trunk of a car when the owner is not nearby.  Or, for example, a virtual key can be used to provide mechanics access to a car for troubleshooting while the owner is at his office. <br><br>  Impressive?  And what do you think about the evolution of automotive, and not only automotive, keys? </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/317668/">https://habr.com/ru/post/317668/</a></p>
