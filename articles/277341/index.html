  <section class="page js-page"><h1>NetSkills Online Networking School</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Hello colleagues!  I would like to inform you that the ‚ÄúNetSkills‚Äú school ‚Äùcontinues its development.  The project itself was originally just for fun, so the word ‚Äúschool‚Äù is used exclusively with quotes. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a35/db6/77c/a35db677c837470ebb910c69e4e3664c.png"><br>  Currently <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/MrSkillAdmin">,</a> there are almost 10 thousand subscribers on the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/MrSkillAdmin">YouTube</a> channel, and their number is constantly growing. <br>  A regular course on the fundamentals of GNS3 was recently completed, and now the NetSkills ‚Äúschool‚Äù has all the necessary minimum for training young professionals in networking technologies, namely: <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <a href="http://blog.netskills.ru/p/cisco-packet-tracer.html"><b>1. ‚ÄúYoung fighter course‚Äù</b></a> is a course on the Cisco Packet Tracer software simulator, where we briefly review the basics of network technologies. <br>  <a href="http://blog.netskills.ru/p/gns3.html"><b>2. ‚ÄúBasics of GNS3‚Äù</b></a> - this course allows us to expand our training opportunities by getting the full functionality of various emulated devices.  If you have mastered this material, this is a significant plus in your professional career. <br>  <a href="http://blog.netskills.ru/p/blog-page.html"><b>3.Architecture of corporate networks</b></a> is a guide for beginner network engineers who want to get acquainted with the basics of building corporate networks.  The book discusses the hierarchical model and the main modules of the corporate network, their location in the network, as well as the basic methods of protection.  This manual is perfect for system engineers who need to standardize the applicable network solutions. <br>  <b>4.Also in the blog.netskills.ru blog</b> various IT is constantly published - news, reviews and useful materials. <br>  These materials can be safely used for training young professionals. <br><br>  And now I would like to carry out some analysis of the work done on the last course, <b>‚ÄúFundamentals of GNS3‚Äù</b> . <br>  <b>Some course statistics:</b> <br>  <b>1.</b> In total, there are 13 lessons in the course, not counting the Introduction and Conclusion.  Lessons included in the course: <br>  ‚Ä¢ Installation on Windows <br>  ‚Ä¢ Installation on Linux <br>  ‚Ä¢ Basic setting.  Adding Cisco Images <br>  ‚Ä¢ Simplest network <br>  ‚Ä¢ Add host to network.  Virtual PC Simulator <br>  ‚Ä¢ Switch in GNS3 <br>  ‚Ä¢ L3 switch (Router + EtherSwitch module) <br>  ‚Ä¢ Add VirtualBox Host <br>  ‚Ä¢ Add VMware Workstation Host <br>  ‚Ä¢ Adding your computer to the GNS3 network <br>  ‚Ä¢ Connect GNS3 to real network <br>  ‚Ä¢ Cisco ASA + ASDM <br>  ‚Ä¢ Wireshark <br>  <b>2. We</b> watched this course for 9 thousand people. <br>  <b>3. A</b> course of 5 months was recorded.  Again, longer than I would like ... <br><br>  <b>Now let's talk about the problems and shortcomings of GNS3.</b>  <b>Unfortunately, there is something to tell.</b> <br>  <b>1.</b> The first thing that upset me is the lack of ability to emulate a Cisco PIX.  Yes, this is a very old version and now has Cisco ASA, but pix-a has its merits.  PIX requires less resources (usually 512mb of memory), it has similar functionality and command syntax to Cisco ASA.  But the most important thing is that it is much more stable and that‚Äôs a fact.  Unfortunately more gns3 does not support this device. <br>  <b>2.</b> The second is terrible problems with the Cisco ASA.  At one time I switched to gns3 only because of Asa.  Then gns3 was version 0.8.7, if I'm not mistaken.  ASA worked with some errors, but in general it could be used.  Now version 1.4 is available for gns3 and it has become almost impossible to work with Asa.  The launch process is similar to the famous tambourine dance.  I found about five launch instructions on the Internet and not a single method gives a 100 percent guarantee of work.  And on one computer the first method can work, on another computer - only the second one.  Changing the version of qemu, creating flash memory, running under linux, limiting the CPU load, all this has to be checked using the scientific method, because  There is no pattern. <br>  <b>3.</b> Bug with routers.  Having collected and configured a scheme with routers at some point, you can find that the traffic just stopped going.  A long troubleshooting begins, but in the end it turns out that you just need to restart the router.  The answer to the question ‚ÄúWhy do such freezes occur?‚Äù I never found. <br>  <b>4.</b> Loss of interfaces.  Most recently revealed this problem.  It occurs in both the L3 switches and the Cisco ASA.  In the device configuration, interfaces are simply not visible.  For routers, this is solved by selecting other ios images.  And for the ASA by adding another interface. <br>  <b>5.</b> I will not say anything about the constantly changing GNS3 portal and everything is clear. <br>  On the one hand, all the listed bugs are useful, because  make a person look for a problem, honing the skills of troubleshooting.  But SUCH the number of ‚Äúfeatures‚Äù of the program just slows down the work.  As a result, instead of learning, a person may spend several days with another bug, desperately trying to raise Cisco ASA and ASDM in GNS3.  Here you can certainly argue and rely on the curvature of the user's hands, but the problems are too common and their huge number.  The gns3 portal just dazzles with them, but the developers do not seem to hear or see anything, continuing to stamp release after release, slightly changing the interface and adding advertising.

      <b>Nevertheless, despite all the shortcomings listed, GNS3 is still the most popular software for network emulation.</b>  Him: <br>  <b>1.</b> Convenient and intuitive interface.  The same UnetLab, which today is regarded as the main competitor, has only a web interface, which is not very convenient and for many is unusual. <br>  <b>2.</b> And second - Free (unlike products such as Cisco VIRL and Boson NetSim) <br>  I think at the moment gns3 is ideal for small virtual networks of two or three routers, when you need to quickly raise the layout, so to say ‚Äúon the knee‚Äù. <br><br>  However, it is also worth noting that if GNS3 continues to evolve along the same strategy, UnetLab will quite quickly seize the initiative and catch up with it (of course, if the project continues to evolve). <br><br>  <b>Now I would like to share plans.</b> <br>  I think everyone understands that the courses described above are not enough for a successful start of an IT career.  Therefore, the NetSkills school has ambitious plans for the near future, namely: <br>  <b>1.</b> A course on the basics of Linux.  I am deeply convinced that every self-respecting network engineer simply must be able to work with Linux-like systems.  A huge number of network devices, such as firewalls, intrusion prevention systems, VPN gateways and even switches, are based on Linux.  This is especially true with the current trend of import substitution. <br>  <b>2.</b> Course on the basics of network design.  A very important course.  In it, we look at the main aspects of network planning and documentation.  A good network engineer is not only a setup, but also a well-documented network!  L2, L3 schemes, IP plan, cable magazine, we will look at all this as part of the course. <br>  <b>3.</b> UNetLab.  This course is absolutely necessary for those who want to get a CCNP or CCIE certificate.  And for CCNA enough bundles and Cisco Packet Tracer + GNS3. <br>  <b>4.</b> CCNA Prep Guide.  In it, we will look at how to successfully pass the exam ‚Ññ1 in the world of network technologies. <br>  There are some more ideas, but so far nothing concrete.  These are the plans for the near future. <br><br>  Well, here we will finish on such an ambiguous note.  I sincerely hope that this material has been useful to you.  I am waiting for you on the next courses and see you soon! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/277341/">https://habr.com/ru/post/277341/</a></p>
