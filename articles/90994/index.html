  <section class="page js-page"><h1>About morals and games</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/05b/8e1/29d/05b8e129d370996bd43f56a8f0b610a4.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  These conversations were supposed to begin immediately with the advent of the first games and the gaming industry itself.  Any Mario, Call of Duty, Halo, have you ever thought about killing another dummy or how much did Mario have to go to save Princess Peach?  How many innocent animals did he have to kill? <a name="habracut"></a>  Adults can quite easily distinguish reality from virtuality, but even children and teenagers play games, and it is much harder for them to perceive the cruelty, lack of need and the porn that is happening in the virtual-real world.  Or even easier, thanks to the same virtualization of everything and everyone.  Want to say that the adult generation was raised as well?  Was there a game available for the ‚Äúadult‚Äù generation in which it was possible to kill hundreds of Russians, so much so that you cannot distinguish it from reality in the bud?  Do you think that eight-bit is still in authority after these words?  I doubt it.  Even in movies and books there is no such brutality, as in the new part of Call of Duty.  In general, this topic can be talked about a lot, but this topic goes on deeper and deeper at quite official levels, such as in our State Duma, and in the USA even by the President himself.  The excitement around morality and games (well, morality in games, respectively) really rose to a high level after the announcement of Six Days in Fallujah, allegedly this game touches too bitter moments in the history of the war between Iraq and America, which already becomes disgusting.  It came to the point that lawsuits against a developer‚Äôs company began.  And what, it would be quite a shot at the Iraqi dummies, cho. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/6b8/f77/88d/6b8f7788d024a74c7b6765bb3b2d16b8.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  If you look at it from another bell tower, then games are knowledge, and for example, the same Six Days in Fallujah will teach us more than the 2010 Oscar Lord of the Storm, which tells about the brave sappers who want peace in the whole world.  But this reasoning is already for an adult who has had a self-esteem and world view, but not for children.  After all, I‚Äôm remembering myself when I wasn‚Äôt very clever and not really adult, I played games just to play.  I was not interested in either the plot or the atmosphere.  It was just fun to play, crush animals in mario, chop into battletoads with friends and tear off limbs in a mortal kombat.  Everything.  And what is the current youth experiencing, killing tons of dummies in a game that visually differs little from reality?  Yet again. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/e75/720/d79/e75720d79eda4901552e93c6f26c23e8.jpg" alt="image">

      Quite a different turn took the story of Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 and the scene of the Russian airport.  Media giants such as CNN and BBC even invaded the mass discussion.  A bunch of threads appeared on Russian forums, about morality in games, and is it really good to shoot a huge crowd of people in games for the younger generation, because in Russia there is no censor rating, and any schoolchild can easily pull the game away from torrents or buy a game at a local counter .  Any talk about cutting this level out of the game for the Russian audience is complete nonsense - after the obvious changes in the settings and folders of the game, the level can be easily restored, because it was not removed from the copy of the game simply.  In this case, discuss the PC version of the game, because  It is based on this particular audience.  For once, even Deputy Seleznev was right, although most of his statements in the direction of the game and Infinity Ward were absurd, such as taking away all the cash from the game from the developers.  But people love scandals and murders, after all, so there is Internet, porn, games and television. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/4df/fb1/4e7/4dffb14e717498991ab2c3331224df4e.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  And recently, the moral revolution around games has been constantly circulating in the public.  Recently, thanks to WikiLeaks, a video has surfaced about the shooting of journalists from large-caliber weapons by the Americans.  Yes, yes, the soldiers thought that the journalists in the hands of not the camera, and RPG.  Yes, yes, there were children in the minivan, but nothing is visible from the camera.  But hell, laugh at the fact that you moved the corpse, or as a little girl to ask the commander in chief to shoot a minivan, stuffed with people, this is too much.  The head of FOXNEWS, put it right in this regard: "They shot people as if in some kind of computer game, with a table of records and other tripe."  But really, what all the same games teach teens?  That's right, for the murder, or rather, how it should be related to this.  Take a similar episode with the shooting of terrorists with large-caliber weapons from a helicopter from Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2, well, for comparison, we will provide the same leaked video with the shooting of journalists.  Feel the difference?  Is she huge? <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/c24/699/275/c24699275781c39124dd67732efdbb1a.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  And if to analyze, this reason can seriously only harm the Russian young mentality, because in the beginning, all shit about innocent entertainment in front of a computer.  Although there is still a lot of other problems coming up, like yagis and smoking, but with such a pace, what will happen to the future healthy generation?  Will they play games that cannot be distinguished from reality, and where can a lot of people be killed?  Are you still going to think that killing empty dummies is just nonsense? <br><br>  Think about it. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/90994/">https://habr.com/ru/post/90994/</a></p>
