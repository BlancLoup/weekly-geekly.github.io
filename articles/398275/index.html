      ‚ÄúWe are working with relevant regulatory agencies to investigate the newly reported cases related to Glaxy Note 7. As consumer safety remains our top priority, Samsung will alert all carriers and retailers around the world about stopping sales and exchanges (meaning stopping the Galaxy Note exchange first waves on the "safe") Galaxy Note 7 at the time of the investigation, "- reported in the official blog of the company. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The story of the Samsung Galaxy Note 7 began in early August.  Then, immediately after the start of sales of the new flagship of the Korean manufacturer, a number of users reported on the self-ignition of the smartphone and battery explosions.  Corresponding videos appeared on YouTube, and then the ‚Äúwave‚Äù was picked up by the world media and technical publications, which further fueled the desire of consumers to ‚Äúcomplain‚Äù about their new product.  On September 2, the Korean manufacturer officially <a href="https://geektimes.ru/post/280042/">announced the recall of all received</a> for the implementation of Galaxy Note 7 to verify and eliminate the problem. <br><br>  According to Samsung‚Äôs plan, all users who wanted to surrender their Galaxy Note 7 could do it for the full cost of the device and in return either get money or another phone from the seller, or wait for a ‚Äúsafe‚Äù lot with the battery defect already eliminated. <br><br>  Apparently, the Koreans had hoped that such drastic measures would stop the discussion of their products in the wrong light, however, Samsung‚Äôs flywheel was already spun.  In mid-September, while the investigation into the causes of the explosion of the Galaxy Note 7 battery occurred, articles and notes appeared in the American media that not only the company's smartphones, <a href="https://geektimes.ru/post/280956/">but even washing machines were</a> exploding. <br><br>  In the annex to the washing machines, the media were already incorrect and frankly "hounded" Samsung.  An explosion is a strong sound ignition of something due to the instantaneous chemical decomposition of a substance and the formation of highly heated gases.  Washing machines of the Korean manufacturer, in fact, collapsed due to the imbalance of the drum and strong vibration, which led to the destruction of the mechanism and scattering of its component parts with serious damage to the body. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/008/bd7/54f/008bd754fbc12ef62487453d815d4328.png"><br>  <em>Samsung washing machine of the problem model with a vertical load, sold mainly in the US market</em> <br><br>  In justification Samsung it is worth noting that the destruction of the mechanism of the machine occurred under load when washing large or water-proof items at high speeds.  However, the question remains why the machine worked ‚Äúfor wear‚Äù and did not track dangerous vibrations and load bias inside the drum during washing and spinning. <br><br>  After the release of the ‚Äúsafe‚Äù Galaxy Note 7 and the issuance of its users in the press, almost immediately there were reports that their batteries would also ignite and explode.  One of the vehicles of the ‚Äúsafe‚Äù lot caught fire on board the aircraft, after which <a href="http://www.wsj.com/articles/faa-urges-passengers-to-not-use-samsung-galaxy-note-7-on-planes-1473381966">some airlines began to demand from the owners of Galaxy Note 7 to completely shut down the device</a> during the flight.  There were also reports of other incidents involving the last Samsung flagship. <br><br>  Under pressure from the public and with the aim of stopping reputational losses, Samsung took a radical step to completely stop production and recall all devices.  It is likely that after a real elimination of the defect that leads to a fire in the battery, the Korean giant will try to resume sales of its flagship.  But by that time a lot of time will be lost, which will weaken the position of Samsung against its main competitor - Apple, and it is also unknown how consumers will react to the ‚Äúrestart‚Äù of a flammable smartphone. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/398275/">https://habr.com/ru/post/398275/</a></p>
