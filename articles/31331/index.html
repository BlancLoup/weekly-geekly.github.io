This is true for everyone, from the worker at the supermarket warehouse, which reads barcodes on goods with a hand scanner and ends with the executive director, who analyzes the most important market trends in the business analysis program.  So if you look at how progress is made and competitive advantages are created, you will have no doubt that the ability to use software effectively is crucial to success in today's global knowledge economy. <br><br>  Strong working knowledge of software to increase productivity and other IT-tools has become the main condition for success in almost any career.  At the same time, however, I do not think that you can overestimate also the value of a good education in mathematics and science. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  If you look at the most interesting things that have emerged over the past decade - whether they are cool things, such as portable audio devices and video games, or more useful things like smartphones and medical technologies - they all come to us from the world of science and engineering.

      <b>Power of software</b> <br>  Today and in the future, software-related professions will have the greatest impact, be it software development for companies like Microsoft or help other organizations successfully use information technology. <br><br>  Communication skills and the ability to work well with different types of people are also very important.  Many people believe that creating software is the lot of hermits only when you sit in an office behind a closed door all day and write a bunch of code.  This is absolutely not true.  Software innovations, like almost every type of innovation, require the ability to collaborate and share ideas with other people, as well as communicate with customers, get feedback from them and understand their needs. <br><br>  I also appreciate the fact that a person has a constant desire for new knowledge.  When I myself was very young, I got into the habit of reading many books.  It's great to read a lot on a variety of topics.  Of course, in our time it is much easier to go online and find information on any topic of interest.  If a person has such curiosity in relation to the world around him, then it will be easier for him to succeed, whatever he chooses to do. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/31331/">https://habr.com/ru/post/31331/</a></p>
