The most relevant of them are: <a href="http://farvater.cloud/event/besplatnyy-vebinar-tdms-farvater-i-bim">work with BIM</a> , <a href="https://youtu.be/FQrlqySfbOM">transfer of documents for state examination</a> , support for PostgreSQL. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The workshop brought together more than forty specialists from the leading design companies of the Crimea.  The participants showed interest in the implementation of project documentation based on TDMS Fairway, especially since it is well combined with modern information modeling technologies (BIM).

      Crimean designers got acquainted with modern trends in project management by experienced business process automation specialists: Dmitry Maslov (Project Manager for Integrated Automation Magma Computer, and Shevket Nafiyev (Head of Design Solutions and BIM Modeling GC AVI Center) Oles Subbotina, a representative of LLC ‚ÄúInstitute Shelf", also personally shared our practical experience in using the TDMS Farway program. We thank personally Olesya and LLC "Shelf" for reviewing our work on  grams in the Crimean realities and a detailed description of the features of the implementation of workflow in the enterprise. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/kc/r2/4x/kcr24xdyvob7ofsjbhxlfs9p2zw.jpeg"><br><br>  Dmitry Maslov shared his impressions on the results of the seminar: <blockquote>  We discussed the challenges facing the industry at the present time, and the ways to most effectively address these challenges.  Almost everyone agrees that BIM is the future.  But each participant has his own views (and doubts) on the future development of this technology, has his own personal experience with different programs in the present.  Therefore, we have repeatedly returned to the discussion of problems arising in managing the common data environment.  I showed our vision of managing the common data environment with TDMS Fairway tools. <br><br>  The demonstrated processes have caused approval both from those who have already taken the first steps in using the BIM technology, and from those who are just thinking about it.  We have once again seen the importance of working with the BIM direction in the TDMS Fairway system: after all, the automation of the document flow in the company will make the transition to BIM more comfortable and faster.  We thank our colleagues, Shevket Nafiev and Olesya Subbotin for the reports on the practical use of TDMS Fairway technical document management system and its interaction with CAD.  Participants appreciated the ability to store any source and derived data in the system, the ability to quickly find information on any of the ongoing projects. </blockquote>  Shevket Nafiev, the speaker from the AVI Center GC, spoke about his conclusions: <blockquote>  As the head of the project direction in our company, I always wanted to find the best option for the software that is used by organizations.  Estimated, calculated, design software, programs for visualization, for architectural modeling - they all represent, as we say, ‚Äúzoo‚Äù, a set of solutions from different manufacturers.  How to link them?  How to make work on a single project?  And I found the answer in the TDMS Fairway program.  It is thanks to her that the common data environment, which is the basis of the BIM technology, is organically woven into the business processes that govern the behavior of all participants in the design process.  The seminar ‚ÄúDocument management of a modern project company in TDMS Fairway‚Äù is our first event for design organizations, but not the last!  We plan to further develop this area: to talk about the interesting and exclusive features of various software products: TDMS Fairway, ARCHICAD, LIRA-SAPR, nanoCAD, normaCS, GRAND Estimate, etc., both separately for each program and about their joint work . </blockquote><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/4x/bh/ga/4xbhgajvg84eblyeutapb_vga30.jpeg"><br><br>  The organizers of the seminar tried to explain all the details of the upcoming transition to innovative technologies.  We are confident that the event participants will sooner or later make a decision to automate the process of managing project activities and thereby qualitatively improve key business processes.  And we will always be there and ready to help. <br><br>  With us you can get advice from the developer TDMS Fairway, as well as a <a href="http://farvater.cloud/load/tdms-farvater">free license for 3 months</a> ! <br><br>  Follow our news on the <a href="http://farvater.cloud/">website</a> and in <a href="https://www.facebook.com/profile.php%3Fid%3D100027498421538">social networks</a> , and subscribe to the channel on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-9GnBrgXOlmuCjBZvxDVWQ/videos">YouTube</a> , so as not to miss our events! <br><br>  We accept applications for events in your city!  <a href="http://farvater.cloud/event/sistema-effektivnogo-upravleniya-proektnym-dokumentooborotom-tdms-farvater-v-vashem-gorode">Fill out an application.</a> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/o0/ab/ki/o0abki2uzcgsmoxfq3nlpqfhvye.jpeg"></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/446432/">https://habr.com/ru/post/446432/</a></p>
