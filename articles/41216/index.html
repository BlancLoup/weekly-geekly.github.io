  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Learn from mistakes</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Recently I got into my hands the <i>GSmart i120</i> from <i>Gigabyte</i> .  I liked him very much.  Weeks 2-3 already run in its capabilities: pumped up a bunch of necessary and unnecessary programs, installed a new firmware, set everything up for yourself.  And how many toys I put, mmmm ... Tanks, balls, chess, races, shooters, zoom in the end! <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Situation: Morning.  I rush to work.  As always, he came out and came back for forgetting.  This time it was the same <i>Gsmart</i> .  By the way, I need to make a reservation that I live and work in the Moscow region, I have to get to work 2 stops by train.  But today, the train on which I usually ride did not come.  And the next one, too, did not come.  And since this watch is the most rush hour in public transport, the people at the bus stop have accumulated more than the vestibules that are already crowded with people.  As a result, I did not get into the first train that arrived, but I firmly decided that I would take the next one by storm.  And I really did it.  When the train started moving, I was in the middle of the vestibule, although I was still on the platform, pushing the peasant standing in front of me and trying to climb after him, it seemed to me that more people simply would not fit there. <br><br>  Go.  I frantically clutching my bag with documents, groping the phone in my pocket and at the same time trying to dodge the feet of the rest of the people ‚Äî why did I clean my shoes in the morning ?!  Looking around for nothing to do.  At the exit, two pretty girls, apparently we went to study.  Next a couple of guys.  Next, I am facing the pair of bloke (it is bloke!) Near the wall, and there are a lot of people around who I don‚Äôt remember.  As I said above, I have two stops to go.  We stop at the first.  A place for 4 more people came from somewhere.  I already do not care about shoes - just to get out alive at my station. <br><br>  We drive up.  I wonder if they are coming up front now.  Polite silence.  OK.  I start to brazenly to the exit.  Girls politely say they will miss.  OK.  Stop.  Girls did not lie, well done.  He came out, sadly looked at the shoes, but then the mood improved - we managed to get out, there was an excuse for the boss.  I climb the bridge to the transition.

      And here we have reached a denouement.  The hand sank into the pocket of the jacket, look at the time on my little <i>black GSmart</i> - am I late for work?  OPA!  And the phone is not.  Naturally, I first searched all the pockets of trousers, jackets, bags and tried to convince myself that I didn‚Äôt take the phone today at all.  But alas, I remembered very well that the phone was still with me in the train. <br><br>  It is difficult to describe what I felt at that moment.  Anger - at first of all, because how can you be such a fool, and put the phone in such an easily accessible place in such a push?  I was angry at my job - what the hell ?!  If it hadn't been for her, I would have slept quietly under a warm blanket of the clock up to 12 ... And of course I was angry with Khmyrey - one of them was just a pickpocket, and maybe both.  It was a shame to the horror, what is there to say.  The matter is not even in the cost of the apparatus, although it matters, the matter is in my own stupidity, in the fact that this situation could not have been. <br><br>  Here, really, they learn only from their mistakes.  Honestly, having come to work, I was already cold.  Brewed a seagull, shared his grief with colleagues - they sympathized and everyone remembered a similar incident from his life or from a friend's life ... In fact, it felt better - after all, all this is such nonsense!  Nevertheless, tomorrow I will go on the same train and try to ‚Äúfind out‚Äù of these guys :) <br><br>  <i>PS</i> By the way, I still have a wonderful <i>Sony Ericsson W550i</i> , and now it‚Äôs quite difficult to buy one!  :) <br><br><hr><br><br>  I wrote this post not only to make myself a little easier.  I have written for those who can learn from the mistakes of others.  I hope you are not so easily caught? </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/41216/">https://habr.com/ru/post/41216/</a></p>
