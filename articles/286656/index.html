      It is no secret that advertising campaigns for mobile applications or games are becoming more expensive, CPI is growing, and the growth of new smartphone users is slowing.  Consequently, the more your page brings new users, the cheaper it costs you to install, the higher your rating, etc. <br><br>  To solve the problem of choosing the most "selling" icons or screenshots in several ways - I suggest to consider each of them and add in the comments - which one do you use ... <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  1. Ask the team, friends, acquaintances, relatives </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/95c/d25/878/95cd25878fcb404cbdebcbe10a5cf736.png" width="250" align="right">  Perhaps one of the most common ways to conduct a micro test.  You already have several creative options in digital or printed form, simulating a page on the App Store and Google Play.  You approach everyone on the way with a request to choose what you like and write the answer in the table. <br><br>  <b>Pros</b> - for free. <br>  <b>Cons</b> - takes a long time, the audience is not always targeted, small audience coverage.  <b>Relevance</b> - if the goal is to find a really working combination, then you should not rely on the data of such a test. <br><br><h2>  2. Invite focus group </h2><br>  In fact - the variation of the first item, but with an emphasis on the quality of the sample.  Participants in the focus group are selected based on specific criteria relevant to your game or application. <br><br>  <b>Pros</b> - the quality of the sample is significantly higher. <br>  <b>Cons</b> - requires a lot of time and money to organize and conduct focus groups.  Being in unusual conditions, group members can make biased choices. <br>  <b>Relevance</b> - with a correctly calculated group size, relevance is quite high.  Analysis, interpretation and correct extrapolation of the collected data strongly depend on the level of the analyst. <br><br><h2>  3. Make several banners and launch an advertising campaign. </h2><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/781/93a/54f/78193a54fb4f4a5ab876373d439d09bb.jpg" width="160" align="right"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/4f6/973/378/4f697337802a4e4885c9c5d0937b5176.png" width="200" align="left">  More advanced developers understand all the flaws of the first methods and try to maximize the audience reach for the A / B test.  Having made several options for banners with different icons, you can create an advertising campaign and buy clicks.  Comparing the CTR of all options, you can choose the best. <br><br>  <b>Pros</b> - the size of the audience sample depends only on your budget, the targeting settings allow you to select an audience according to your interests. <br>  <b>Cons</b> - the banner can not always make it look like a page in the App Store.  If there are several options for each element (icon, screenshots, order of screenshots) - the development of a large number of banners takes time, the budget for the advertising campaign is required. <br>  <b>Relevance</b> is quite high. <br><br><h2>  4. Make your own script for landing pages and run an advertising campaign. </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/8cf/530/ade/8cf530ade81d4c68a1f80eef3dfdc137.jpg" width="220" align="left">  True growth-hacker knows that assumptions are the wrong way.  Knowledge of the Tao of conversion goes through regular meditations on indicators in conditions that are as close as possible to those in battle.  To do this, you can develop your own script for generating landing pages based on the available options.  With these solutions, the process of creating landings is significantly reduced, and they themselves may look similar to a real upstor.  Ready creatives need to upload to the server and run an advertising campaign on the landing page. <br><br>  <b>Pros</b> - the speed of creating banners and landings, the page looks like the App Store, hence the relevance of the results is high. <br>  <b>Minuses</b> - programming skills are required, or an additional development budget, time is required for developing and maintaining the service.  Separately, you may need to configure the server, since the speed of loading landing pages in different countries can directly affect the test results. <br>  <b>Relevance</b> is high.  Proper targeting and similarity of pages make it very likely to judge the relevance of the test results. <br><br><h2>  5. To use automated platform for A / B testing of landing pages </h2><br>  <b>Pros</b> - the highest speed of creating landing pages, a high degree of page similarity <br>  on appstore, a large selection of reports, lack of development costs and maintenance. <br>  <b>Cons</b> - free functionality has limitations, not all platforms can be supported. <br>  <b>Relevance</b> is high.  As a rule, services monitor all changes in the design and layout of pages in the App Store and try to update the service in a timely manner for maximum compliance. <br>  ÔøºÔøº <br>  Reports, segmentation of results, data visualization allow simplifying analysis and decision making. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f15/f71/3f3/f15f713f3fc843cb9f50665cdf29e898.jpg"><br><br>  In the world of ASO, it is taken attentively to any trifles that can change the conversion and enhance organic plants.  In the next article I will try to describe the available methods for analyzing reviews, why this is necessary and how you can simplify the work ... <br><br>  I would be glad to know what, besides keywords, landing pages and reviews, you pay attention to - I invite you in comments. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/286656/">https://habr.com/ru/post/286656/</a></p>
