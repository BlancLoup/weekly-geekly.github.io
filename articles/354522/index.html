  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How is the recruitment at the department ABBYY in MIPT</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  This year, the ABBYY department at the Faculty of Innovations and High Technologies (FIVT) of the Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology turned 12 years old.  During this time, we have trained more than 240 qualified IT specialists, almost a hundred of whom work in the company.  Our developers create unique technologies of intellectual information processing, which are used by more than 50 million users in more than 200 countries of the world.  Keeping the tradition, in April we held a set of students for the next year, 2019.  Today we will talk about how we are looking for talented guys, what they are taught and why they want to work in our company. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/vi/fu/xp/vifuxpcd9svegab7d2s6bg_4iyc.jpeg" alt="image"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  ABBYY employs talented people with innovative thinking and exceptional abilities.  They are engaged in complex, interesting and ambitious tasks that no one has solved before.  Our goal is to find the same talented guys and develop their abilities.  That is why 12 years ago we opened the <a href="https://mipt.ru/education/chairs/imgtextprocessing/">Department of</a> Image Recognition and Text Processing (RIOT) at MIPT, and 7 years ago - the <a href="https://mipt.ru/education/chairs/comp_linguitics/">Department of</a> Computer Linguistics (CL).  Our departments at MIPT help prepare specialists in promising and sought-after areas: machine learning and analysis of texts in natural language.  During training, we pay attention not only to theory, but also to practical tasks, the development and application of technology in business.  More than half of the graduates become employees of the company. <br><br>  The system of education at MIPT is built in such a way that in the first years students undergo fundamental university training, and in older ones they are distributed in basic departments and are actively involved in practical activities of academic institutions like the Scientific Research Institute of the Russian Academy of Sciences and R &amp; D centers of large companies.  Every year dozens of people come to the departments of the <a href="https://www.abbyy.com/ru-ru/science/universities/mipt/imrec/">RIOT</a> and <a href="https://www.abbyy.com/ru-ru/science/universities/mipt/coling/">KL</a> .

      In 2015, according to the results of entrance examinations, 30 out of 80 students were enrolled in ABBYY basic departments. In 2016, 37 out of 90 students accepted the departments, and in 2017, 37 out of 110 people. In this year, we assume that the number of those enrolled may exceed 40, as some guys asked to be allowed to have an interview later.  Although we do not exclude that in the end we will find only 30, but the most motivated students. <br><br>  We take students to the department from the third year of study - first to undergraduate and then to the magistracy.  Previously, the guys write a motivation letter, where they tell about themselves, their skills, why they want to study at the ABBYY departments, what projects they have already done and what they would like to do after the university. <br><br><h2>  How is the set <br></h2><br>  Recruitment is carried out at the end of the second course.  Students gather in a large flow audience at MIPT.  Traditionally, the head of the group of educational projects, Andrei Ocheretny, talks about the company, technological challenges, prospects for the development of the markets in which we work, as well as where graduates of the departments are arranged, about their relevance in the global labor market, and, of course, about the training program and student research papers. <br><br>  Then students receive a test with 10-14 tasks, the solution of which is given an hour and a half. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/k1/-o/ym/k1-oym6esx9v2gbbjrlfia_18mo.jpeg" alt="image"><br><br>  Each year, our developers come up with new problems for students with non-trivial conditions to solve them was interesting, and the answers could not be found on the Internet.  Here are a few tasks from the control of this year.  Can you solve these?) <br><br>  <i>one).</i>  <i>Maxim and puzzle</i> <i><br></i> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/58/2d/9r/582d9r0tn4wdga4vimopzx0cv_u.png" align="left">  <i>Maxim thought it was not interesting to assemble a puzzle alone, and brought him to work.</i>  <i>He gathered programmer friends and poured the details on the table.</i>  <i>We decided to collect in turn.</i>  <i>The first programmer laid out one part, the second one two, the third one three, and so on: each next one laid out more for one part.</i>  <i>It is known that the second lap was laid out in the amount of 100 parts more than the first.</i>  <i>How many programmers did the puzzle collect?</i> <br><br>  <i>2).</i>  <i>As a programmer Dima give his beard a new look</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/qb/8z/xz/qb8zxz_q-3wjb_3lbzw4d_7qits.png" align="left">  <i>One bearded programmer Dima sometimes gives his beard a new look.</i>  <i>On some day, he wondered, and in how many ways he could even comb his beard properly, that is, so that not a single pair of ‚Äúbeards‚Äù (see hair ‚Äî hair) intersected.</i>  <i>A little thought, he built a model of his beard so that each ‚Äúbeard‚Äù had a pair of integer coordinates and one of the predetermined directions.</i>  <i>For example, a beard with the size of 7 * 5 with three available directions might look like this:</i> <i><br><br></i> <div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/yy/li/yr/yyliyrgiph1ppnlkx6mz55xihva.png"></div><br>  At the same time, the ‚Äúbeards‚Äù do not intersect, as was intended.  Namely, in each row, the ‚Äúbeards‚Äù can only go counterclockwise from the previous ‚Äúbeards‚Äù or remain in the same position.  And in each column, on the contrary, each ‚Äúbeard‚Äù leaves the previous one only clockwise or remains in the same position.  Help Dima create an algorithm for determining the number of correct beards, if the beard size (X * Y) and the number of directions (N) for each ‚Äúbeard‚Äù are specified. <br><br>  After the test, students communicate with our programmers.  This interview lasts about 30 minutes.  Our employee checks the solutions of the problems, knowledge and erudition of the student, and also asks him additional questions to check the level of knowledge of programming languages, knowledge of the theory of algorithms and the ability to use various data structures to solve specific problems. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/4t/pm/xh/4tpmxhkwyjcvhibn9aud73w18pm.jpeg" alt="image"><br><br>  Then the interview with our HR specialists begins.  For many students, this is the first interview in life.  The guys tell what they are interested in and what they want to do.  HR pays attention to things traditional for such conversations and, naturally, asks provocative questions: for example, why choosing a student from several basic departments (1C, Yandex, Sberbank, Cognitive Technologies), the student decided to enter the ABBYY department.  We understand that IT is a very important industry and one of the drivers of the country's economy along with the production of raw materials.  The success of the industry depends on the availability of personnel, therefore, on the one hand, companies are already competing for undergraduate students, and on the other hand, market players unite to grow the future of IT in Russia together. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/w0/ag/it/w0agitiykgphttujjsucux_upfg.jpeg" alt="image"><br>  Then we summarize the points for solving the problems, take into account the notes made at the interviews, and compile a list of the guys accepted to the department. <br><br><h2>  About ABBYY Chairs <br></h2><br>  In our department, fellow students often study: together, in their friendly and familiar team, it is easier for them to solve complex problems.  About what courses are taught on CR it is described in more detail <a href="https://www.abbyy.com/ru-ru/science/universities/mipt/coling/">here</a> , at RIOT - <a href="https://www.abbyy.com/ru-ru/science/universities/mipt/imrec/">here</a> . <br><br>  Both ABBYY departments are located in the company.  Here, the guys and learn, and participate in internships and projects of the company to gain the experience necessary for further work.  It is convenient for our employees who teach: they do not need to spend time on the way from the institute to work and back. <br><br><h3>  Theory + Practice <br></h3><br>  Already during their studies, students under the guidance of our specialists carry out unusual and complex projects within ABBYY Labs.  This gives the children the opportunity, in the process of learning, to solve practical tasks facing the developers of the company, to develop programming skills and the ability to work in a team. <br><br><ul><li>  For example, one of the student groups in 2014 developed the MathHero mobile application, which recognized mathematical equations from photography and gave out their solutions.  To create a project, the guys used the technology ABBYY Mobile OCR Engine for Windows.  More about this project, we told in <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/abbyy/blog/136506/">this article</a> . </li><li>  Another team in 2016 investigated modern open-source structured data visualization solutions.  The guys chose the trilogy of Jules Verne's novels ‚ÄúChildren of Captain Grant‚Äù, ‚ÄúTwenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea‚Äù and ‚ÄúMysterious Island‚Äù to visualize textual information in natural language using <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/abbyy/blog/269191/">ABBYY Compreno</a> technology.  They had a goal to show that the task of analyzing and visualizing a large amount of unstructured text data is no longer overwhelming.  We already <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/abbyy/blog/305970/">talked</a> more about the project in Habr√©, and the results of the work can be found in Russian and English on this beautiful site <a href="http://julesvernetrilogy.com/">julesvernetrilogy.com</a> . </li><li>  In 2017, students of the RIOT department Masha Sandrikova, Alexey Zhuravlev and Andrey Sautin <a href="https://techfusion.ru/imagine-cup-2017-russia/">won</a> the Russian finals of the international technology contest <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imagine_Cup">Microsoft Imagine Cup</a> with their project <a href="https://meetarticles.me/">Meet Articles</a> .  This is a service for visualizing information about scientific articles, which with the help of ABBYY Compreno technology greatly simplifies the search for sources and scientists working in the chosen field.  Last July, the guys <a href="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/microsoftimagine/2017/06/14/here-are-the-2017-imagine-cup-world-finalists-competing-for-100000/">represented</a> Russia at the international finals in Seattle. </li></ul><br><h2>  And then what? <br></h2><br>  Thanks to active practice, it is easier for students to understand what they want to do in the future and feel like a part of our company.  That is why already during training the guys start working at ABBYY.  After release, they come to the technology department, as well as the product teams of FineReader, DataCapture, SDK, Cloud, Mobile, and others. <br><br>  By the way, there are interesting vacancies in these departments.  Ask any questions and join our team! <br><br>  All ABBYY vacancies can be viewed on <a href="https://www.abbyy.com/ru-ru/vacancy/">this page</a> . <br><br>  <i>Elizaveta Titarenko, editor of the corporate blog ABBYY</i> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/354522/">https://habr.com/ru/post/354522/</a></p>
