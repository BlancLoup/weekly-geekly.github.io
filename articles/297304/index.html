As you remember, since ancient times people had fairy tale characters talking to the wind and the sun, and social institutions brought human casualties to rain or lightning to increase their economic growth.  But business is not limited to natural phenomena, millennia have passed, and in modern culture and art, we still love to endow the human soul with animals and equipment, household items and works of art.  This, apparently, in us is already ineradicable. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/37e/7f9/49b/37e7f949b7221f9df6d8628b130770a7.jpg" alt="image"><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  So, it turns out, your customers and buyers are able to endow the image of the human soul with any product or service, including your website or even a printed advertising booklet.  And then the fun begins.

      As is known, the psychology of the overwhelming majority of mammals is naturally inclined to submission, that is, to put it simply, is only to find the steepest leader (leader, alpha male) for himself, swear to his will and, with a sense of optimism and confidence in tomorrow full day, gradually unknowingly sculpt the cult of his leader, paying him honors for achievements and personal security.  Of course, there is always a scanty minority, which actually waits until the current Akella grows old, in order to immediately get involved in squabbling over the leader‚Äôs vacant position, but from the point of view of marketing, these very 5% will not be interesting to us, since it is they who absolutely do not lend themselves to the charm of the cult of the new leader, hoping to impose their own cult on us. <br><br>  There is a controversial statement (with which I personally tend to agree) that every time all these inventions of a ‚Äúspecial way‚Äù like spiritual practices, religions, and other cults were just another attempt by more physically weak individuals to come up with an alternative hierarchy purely for gamma - men.  Exactly so, not having a chance in an open duel with the current leader, they got real power and resources by ‚Äúbypass maneuver‚Äù by writing to the ‚Äúslaves of God‚Äù all those who are also slaves of their leader / khan / prince.  Moreover, having created this new structure, former adherents of Good and Light begin to fiercely crush their resources and suppress even the slightest dissent, and the medieval inquisition is the clearest example of the fact that everything is always done only for the sake of power, but not in the name of the advent of the Universal Era. Goodness and Selflessness. <br><br>  Here, along the way, I will have to clarify one misconception.  Many people for some reason are convinced that you can become an alpha leader simply by birth from a distinguished father (or, in the case of a product, from an already promoted brand).  Unfortunately, nothing is further from reality;  and charisma, physical strength as well as the ability to power, are not sexually transmitted.  History knows hundreds of cases where the sons of famous rulers were unsuitable to command even their own family, or even abandon any struggle for survival, declaring a complete abandonment of power and their own animal desires (to google Prince Gautama), and people from the peasants became kings and emperors (google liu ban).  High-quality education in childhood also does not affect the fate of real leaders, as the internal ability to learn from an individual is much more important than the level of his teacher or the design of the student‚Äôs desk (google Lomonosov).  So the cult of purely external root causes or everyday circumstances for the formation of a future leader will be considered as wandering in darkness. <br><br>  By the way, based on this erroneous way, we still see with you an overly-painful cult of design and usability, supposedly capable of an alternative way, through the magic alchemy of the right colors and combinations of the original interface elements, to suddenly gain power over the minds of ordinary people and force them into mental projection of the image of one's own happiness even for the most crappy and initially useless product.  However, in practice, all these attempts to gain new client adherents are doomed to failure, and the reason is simple and trivial - your product, if you remove all masks and clothing from it, is simply not able to conquer hearts and dominate minds.  The true ruler, even in his pajamas, will remain the leader, and the jester who has put on the crown will remain a jester.  The most wonderful design of a button and a million pages of a site with all existing keywords in the world will not help the true essence of your gamma product to magically mutate to alpha.  How to be?  Here is a <a href="http://oreol.info/istoriya-viski-dewar-s/">perfect historical example</a> : <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/2a5/f9f/e81/2a5f9fe8100c4b07317575e2fc162326.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <i>As it turned out, it is not so easy to promote whiskey in London if you do not have a lot of money.</i>  <i>There was an unusual use of whiskey - people preferred to drink gin, rum and brandy.</i>  <i>But over time, Dewar's gradually began to occupy advantageous positions in the British market.</i>  <i>An interesting strategy was used for this: secret buyers were hired, who went to pubs and asked them to pour only whiskey from Dyuars.</i>  <i>Of course, it turned out that there was no whiskey on sale.</i>  <i>Disappointed pseudo-buyers left.</i>  <i>After some time, Tommy appeared and offered to cooperate with him.</i>  <i>The owner of the restaurant at that time was already familiar with the drink and knew that it was in demand, so Dewar received a new cooperation contract</i> . <br><br>  Pay close attention, as the unknown product was initially positioned as the ‚Äúalpha male‚Äù on the market, who came to get himself ‚Äúlegitimate power and females‚Äù by right of the strong. <br><br>  Surely, all of you are already strained now and are waiting for an example of an iPhone from me now to show you to consider another successful strategy for bringing an alpha product to a gray and dull market.  Yes, this is all true, but the image is too banal, and there is an even more interesting example showing you the behavior of a person who forms a product of a new quality level (that is, an image of an ideal you, immediately after reading and assimilating this article) - <a href="http://shkola2-0.ru/ucheniku/istorii/chelovek-kotorij-izmenil-vse">and this Magic Johnson</a> .  As the first year he came to one of the greatest NBA teams, he immediately, from the very first second, behaved as the main star among this constellation of honored stars.  He completely led the attack, with errors he shouted at partners twice as old and smiling, praised for their success.  He came not just to play, but to dominate the league, throughout the basketball market, on TV channels and in bookmaker offices. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/131/69a/732/13169a73256ad5c2a92d84305ff3b09b.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <i>‚ÄúThe advantage of the point guard is 6 feet 10 inches in that he is able to see over the heads of opponents.</i>  <i>I remember that first training session of Irwin with the Lakers, when he gave me a program that I simply did not have time to see.</i>  <i>I was not even open, and no sane person would have tried to give me the ball in that situation.</i>  <i>However, he saw an opportunity to pass and hit the ball in my head.</i>  <i>After a couple of minutes, Irvine, without looking, gave the transfer between the opponents, who again hit my head.</i>  <i>It was then that I realized that either you should always be ready for his passes, or you simply won‚Äôt get the ball.</i>  <i>The coach wanted Magic to get used to us, but the truth was that we all had to get used to him, ‚Äùrecalled Lakers forward Jamaal Wilks.</i> <br><br>  We had to get used to it.  Us to him.  US.  TO HIM.  Please, greet this phrase, because it contains all the existing Tao of marketing, and outside it is just empty talk and lost shadows.  Us to him.  Do not play by someone else's rules, do not come readily to obey.  Manage the game, the market, the rules, the requirements, set the new format of interaction, reveal to the world the hitherto unknown principles of interaction between your product and its consumer, become OVER the existing state of affairs.  I know that from the first time it is difficult, so do not be lazy to re-read this paragraph again from the beginning, because still you will not find anything more valuable today in the runet.  Us to him, to hell with them all !!! <br><br>  Let's sum up the disappointing results: one of the most popular for today and, concurrently, one of the most erroneous strategies is to start a business right away with creating a website, a sales plan, a set of keywords and banner design.  So freshly bought slaves go to bow to their master with a request to submit at least a few crumbs for food from the master's table, ‚Äúfor my life ...‚Äù It‚Äôs worth now to think about how you can plan to create a mental image of humanity from your unique business proposal , give the suffering hearts a new material image of the leader, the animated product leader, whose owners will gladly give their hearts to the undivided possession of your new brand. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/297304/">https://habr.com/ru/post/297304/</a></p>
