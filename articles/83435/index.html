It is easy to explain, because we are designers.  Today, in the office, a new ‚Äúbeast‚Äù of the <a href="http://www.wacom.eu/index2.asp%3Fpid%3D294%26lang%3Dru%26spid%3D4">Wacom Bamboo Fun M Pen &amp; Touch has started</a> .  I want to share my personal impressions about this tablet. <br><br> <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/turbomilk/4340357454/" title="wacom-bamboo-fun-pen-touch-1 by turbomilk, on Flickr"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/391/aaf/34a/391aaf34ad5abb44d47cb61447ada275.jpg" width="800" height="533" alt="wacom-bamboo-fun-pen-touch-1"></a> <br><br>  I‚Äôll start the story of my relationship with Wacom products.  I have been using tablets of this Japanese company for more than 10 years.  At first I had the first wacom intuos A5 for quite a while.  Then the first intuos, but the size of A4.  And then I again returned to the size of the A5, since the A4 is too big, and now I have the Wacom Intuos 3 Medium.  There were times when I didn‚Äôt use the mouse at all, and did all the operations only with a tablet.

      All of these tablets were from the professional line.  And then a logical question should arise: ‚ÄúFuck, did you buy a tablet from the lower line for 8510 rubles, if you already have a pro-model for 15 thousand?‚Äù The fact is that the Touch function attracts me very much, that is, you can not make a call on the tablet only foam, but also fingers.  Moreover, it supports multi-touch technology, to which I was very used to the touchpad of a laptop. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br> <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/turbomilk/4339612943/" title="wacom-bamboo-fun-pen-touch-2 by turbomilk, on Flickr"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/69a/91a/12a/69a91a12a535dd5b4f0294014791b33d.jpg" width="800" height="532" alt="wacom-bamboo-fun-pen-touch-2"></a> <br><br>  Everything is packaged in a simple but elegant way.  The tablet and the packaging smell like delicious plastic, not as much as fresh poppies, of course, but also nothing.  So I remember earlier there was a strange and inconvenient "vertical" packaging, everything was in separate boxes. <br><br> <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/turbomilk/4339613073/" title="wacom-bamboo-fun-pen-touch-3 by turbomilk, on Flickr"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/0a9/537/ed0/0a9537ed0ec35f98645b73a481d45790.jpg" width="800" height="532" alt="wacom-bamboo-fun-pen-touch-3"></a> <br><br>  The tablet was very high quality to the touch.  In the pictures that are on the site, it looks like something not very.  In life, it is much better - plastic "under luminescence" and a glossy white insert.  Included is an ugly, but convenient foam, three spare anti-friction rods, a special ring to pull out the rods, plus a box with discs and instructions.  It is very good that the bundle does not have a huge power supply, the tablet connects to USB and is powered by it.  And there is no mouse in the set!  Finally, it came to Vakomov that no one needs it! <br><br> <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/turbomilk/4339613217/" title="wacom-bamboo-fun-pen-touch-4 by turbomilk, on Flickr"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/39e/899/df7/39e899df77893f7fdb9917f09dc07095.jpg" width="800" height="532" alt="wacom-bamboo-fun-pen-touch-4"></a> <br><br>  I found with great disappointment that the tablet was made not in Japan, as it was with my previous wakomas, but in China.  But never mind, let's hope it doesn't break.  Fortunately there is nothing special to break. <br><br> <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/turbomilk/4339613391/" title="wacom-bamboo-fun-pen-touch-5 by turbomilk, on Flickr"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/883/cb6/a4d/883cb6a4df640c2e000cd32f52cd0699.jpg" width="800" height="532" alt="wacom-bamboo-fun-pen-touch-5"></a> <br><br>  Special attention is given to the red ‚Äúlabel‚Äù wack, as on jeans.  It turned out that this is a special holder for foam.  The solution is original and elegant, the pen will not be so lost.  But the traditional inkwell-stand is still more convenient for everyday work, especially if the table is littered with all sorts of very necessary stuff. <br><br> <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/turbomilk/4339613501/" title="wacom-bamboo-fun-pen-touch-6 by turbomilk, on Flickr"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/26b/553/268/26b553268c5de6a9305854b365d724f2.jpg" width="800" height="532" alt="wacom-bamboo-fun-pen-touch-6"></a> <br><br>  The tablet is ideally suited for every Apple app.  Here it is next to the apple wireless keyboard.  It would probably look good with a magic mouse, if I had one. <br><br> <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/turbomilk/4339613799/" title="wacom-bamboo-fun-pen-touch-8 by turbomilk, on Flickr"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/28e/d10/c9d/28ed10c9db86a7b17a783b51faacfc83.jpg" width="800" height="532" alt="wacom-bamboo-fun-pen-touch-8"></a> <br><br>  The tablet "understands" the touch of a few fingers.  So I understood, no more than two, since there are no ‚Äúthree-finger‚Äù gestures in the settings.  It is very convenient to zoom or rotate pictures.  And just like a ‚Äúbig touchpad‚Äù the tablet works fine and accurate. <br><br> <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/turbomilk/4339613707/" title="wacom-bamboo-fun-pen-touch-7 by turbomilk, on Flickr"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c0c/9b8/619/c0c9b861938128189cd001c0749c651a.jpg" width="800" height="532" alt="wacom-bamboo-fun-pen-touch-7"></a> <br><br>  Pleased scrolling "two fingers".  The most important function for me.  I look at a lot of web pages and read different documents, so I often have to scroll something.  And if you work with foam, then you must first put it, and then reach for the wheel of the mouse.  Here, too, the pen must be put, but it is not necessary to reach anywhere. <br><br>  On the left there are 4 buttons.  I programmed them like this: <br><ol><li>  Expose: show all windows </li><li>  Expose: show desktop </li><li>  Right click </li><li>  Left click </li></ol><br>  Initially, the first button was configured to enable / disable the Touch mode.  I did not understand why this was done, because if I bring pen to the tablet, he understands what they want from him and only works with a pen.  And if you remove the pen, he immediately understands the touch of his fingers. <br><br>  The main problem with working in Touch mode is how to drag objects.  (move the cursor with the button pressed) (Drag &amp; Drop) I initially helped with my left hand and simply clamped the button (one of the four on the left) with a click.  But it turned out there is a trick - you must very quickly click your finger on the object and immediately guide your finger, then the object starts to ‚Äúdrag‚Äù.  It is still inconvenient to select something - a text or a picture.  (although these are special cases of "dragging") <br><br>  Pros: <br><ul><li>  Small price (8500 rubles) </li><li>  Multitouch technology </li><li>  Very pleasant rough coating tablet </li><li>  The feeling of high-quality and good-quality things (except foam) </li><li>  Convenient scrolling </li><li>  Excellent drivers (with Mac OS, the tablet works just perfectly, no settings are needed) </li></ul><br>  Minuses: <br><ul><li>  No tablet tilt adjustment relative to the table </li><li>  It's inconvenient to do Drag &amp; Drop </li><li>  No coasters for foam </li><li>  The foam does not look very attractive, plus, it does not have a rubber grip </li></ul><br>  Conclusion  Great stuff for both home and work.  Tempted artists or illustrators who paint on a computer, of course, will not work.  But bending the curves in Illustrator or working with photos is the most.  It may well replace the mouse. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/83435/">https://habr.com/ru/post/83435/</a></p>
