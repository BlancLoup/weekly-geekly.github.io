  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Dog</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  A boy of eighteen was walking through the park.  He slightly wore both legs, which made his walk look a bit strange.  But his back was flat, his step was confident, his gaze was straight and firm.  On a long leash he kept a dog.  She was very old, it was noticeable in her slow, uncertain walk, and in gray hair, and in her teary eyes.  They walked alongside, and it was immediately apparent that they were together. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  - Mom!  Look, dog!  - a sonorous children's voice tore up the familiar hum of the big city.  ‚ÄúCan I give her my sandwich?‚Äù <br>  Mila sighed heavily.  It begins again.  Dimka already tortured her by asking to buy a dog.  Just Kid and Carlson some.  But Mila was totally against it.  First, endless puddles, then wool ... In addition, she was well aware that all the worries about the dog: walks, feeding, vaccinations, etc. - will fall on her shoulders.  Dimka was still too small to care for another living creature. <br>  - Dimka, you know, there is no one to care for the dog.  I am at work all day, you're at school, and besides, you're still too small. <br>  - And dad? <br>  ‚ÄúAnd Dad,‚Äù Mila‚Äôs voice trembled treacherously, fortunately, Dimka, due to his age, could not pay attention to it, ‚Äúand Dad had no time to come to us to walk with the dog. <br>  Dimka frowned.  Mila, sighing again, took out a sandwich from the bag, reserved in case Dimka got hungry during the walk, and gave it to her son.  The boy walked over to the reclining dog and gently placed a piece of bread and sausage next to his muzzle. <br>  The dog was already very old.  He simply lay on the grass of the park and waited for this bright light to finally turn off, which so irritated his inflamed eyes.  Suddenly a little man appeared in front of him.  He held out a piece of something very delicious smelling.  The dog gently took the treat and gratefully licked the sweet-smelling palm.  The boy ran away and left, looking around all the time.  The dog suddenly became very warm.  He closed his eyes and fell asleep. <br>  Forever and ever. <br>  A few days later, Mila went out with Dimka to walk to the playground.  The children frolicked, roared, chased each other, rolled downhill.  Dimka also ran with everyone, laughing happily.  He climbed onto the horizontal bar.  Mila wanted to stop him, but did not have time.  Dimka broke down, slammed ridiculously and could not get up. <br>  Three months later, Mila, blackened by grief, brought Dima home.  In a wheelchair.  Doctors admitted that all is not lost, but it was difficult to believe in it.  Most likely Dimka will never be able to walk.  And Dimka ... in the chair ... serious and quiet, even in his eight years he understood that something very bad had happened ... He no longer cried and was not afraid ... <br>  Mila wheeled the carriage into the corridor. <br>  Sighed. <br>  And opened the door to the next room. <br>  From there, funny waddling on short crooked paws, a shaggy red puppy crawled out.  He funny puzzled face and poked at all with a wet black nose. <br>  ‚ÄúDimka,‚Äù Mila said, ‚Äúas if she managed strictly,‚Äù you promised that you would bring up the dog yourself.  The time has come to keep the promise. <br>  Six months later, Dimka rose from the chair.  He very quickly got tired and sat back, but he could take a few steps.  And after a couple of months, he himself went for a walk with a puppy (now an adult dog), named by a funny and incomprehensible name Bendik.  Dimka walked very slowly, holding Mila‚Äôs hand, shaking her legs uncertainly.  But went.  Himself. <br>  10 years have passed.  Bendik has grown old, and already with difficulty moved his paws.  And Dima, now Dima, was walking next to him, ready, if anything, to catch him.  And Dima knew that he owed this dog what was coming. <br>  They walked alongside.  Young limping guy and old dog.  And they were good together. <br>  ¬© ZamDuD <br><br>  Taken from <a href="http://pritchi.castle.by/">pritchi.castle.by</a> </div>
