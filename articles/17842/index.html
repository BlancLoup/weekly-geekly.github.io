At the new location, repair is now ending, and I, as director and system engineer, need to decide in one person what to do with the wires (electricity, telephone, network). <br><br>  After the experience of entangling everything and everything in this office, I know that putting cable without boxes is idiocy and mockery, so a strategic decision was made to use the box, and in order to finally round off this case, then take not just the box, but those for which You can attach sockets immediately. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>

      ‚ÄúWhat is the problem?‚Äù The unprepared reader will say?  "I went and bought it!"  But no.  We are in Russia, and to be more precise, 80 km.  from Moscow, so in my city it seems simple only at first glance. <br><br>  At first, when I went to that store, where I constantly buy light bulbs, cables and other crap, I saw a good T-Plast box there, just what I need. <br><br>  If someone does not know, then not just any box you can attach sockets.  The box must be of a certain strength and allow such fastening. <br><br>  Price suited me, equipment too.  The result was something in the region of 11 thousand, along with sockets.  In the store, they assured me that the inscription on the piece of paper with the prices ‚ÄúDelivery within 3-7 days‚Äù is true, and that there are no problems with delivery.  This I clarified on December 15. <br><br>  Just yesterday, that is, the 20th day in the room where we will move, finished the main work, that is, it became possible to accurately measure the number of boxes and additional elements to it, well, for example, external corners, internal corners, etc. . <br><br>  After measuring and calculating, I called the store in the morning.  Why in the morning?  And in order to have time to send the payment to the bank before lunch, so that the money reached the same day.  I call the store employee, he is just the sales manager for those boxes, and then the difficulties begin. <br><br>  To begin with, the employee delighted me with the question ‚ÄúDo you need boxes before the New Year?‚Äù.  I‚Äôm wondering if I say that I want to pay today, for how long should the delivery be?  That's right, December 27, that is, until the end of the year. <br><br>  Then it turned out that in order to fully receive my order, you need to contact Moscow and clarify.  The order, by the way, is small - 34 meters of the box and some fittings to it. <br><br>  I am waiting for a call back.  The time of payment to the bank is near, therefore I call myself.  It turns out that the manager, who was supposed to clarify with Moscow, left it is not clear where, so now they will clarify where the manager is, and he, in turn, will clarify that with the boxes. <br><br>  The multi-pass combination ended only this morning with a final refusal, that is, to bring it in any way.  Everything.  Point. <br><br>  "Goats", I thought, and called the head company for these boxes in Moscow.  They expressed their willingness to sell me even a kilometer box, but only in bulk.  That is, 200 meters of boxes in one package, and no retail. <br><br>  To my question about retail outlets, the manager responded evasively.  They have only one registered sales point for all of Moscow, the rest are simply bought at wholesale prices and resold, so he cannot guarantee for the assortment with them. <br><br>  I call that very single point and clarify, damn it, that they have a box, there are fittings, but there is no special thing (or rather, 24 special pieces) to attach to the same outlet box.  And without this I don‚Äôt have any sense of buying a box from them. <br><br>  Desperation was near.  Having driven the cherished box title into Google, I started calling the others.  It turned out that this box (only box, without fittings) sells almost everything, but what's the use of the box for me?  In a way, it is important only with the possibility of fixing sockets, I need it in this form, and not just as a box. <br><br>  And what do you have to do as a result?  That's right, to go to the construction market outside the city, where in a half-open container, leading with a greasy pencil through the pages of a filthy catalog, I calmly promise to bring a slightly different box to the environment, more expensive, but just with mounting sockets and a full ammunition fittings.  Without asking for prepayment and not enduring the brain.  Like this. <br><br>  And the conclusion?  And the conclusion is this.  <strong>People, if you work in the field of sales or services, then do not take on those obligations that you can not fulfill.</strong>  <strong>Do not be misleading, be prepared to do what you have taken on yourself at any time (reasonable).</strong>  <strong>Do not look back at the New Year and holidays!</strong>  <strong>And I beg you, supply solutions, and not things with little connected among themselves for sale!</strong> <br><br>  With love, <br>  <a href="http://geektimes.ru/users/maniaque/" class="user_link">maniaque</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/17842/">https://habr.com/ru/post/17842/</a></p>
