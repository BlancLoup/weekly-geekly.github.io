And once there was a desire to remove one seminar.  And then they decided that if there are people, why not remove them ?!  After all, they can say to the camera those reviews that they usually write on paper.  They took video reviews and then thought: what to do with all this?  Below is the first experience in this matter and some insights on how to do this. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>

    <div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Immediately spoiler about the required video quality for YouTube</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  In my opinion, YouTube is not needed by Hollywood, super-duper quality is not needed - no one will appreciate it, everyone will appreciate WHAT is filmed there, just look at the top views (seals and wines / feil) - the main thing is that you download it.  Even cool studios are making videos for YouTube in the style of home video so that no one has any doubts about fake (think of the commercial for the clerk who has gone astray - an advertisement for the film ‚ÄúEspecially Dangerous‚Äù).  So the glamor on YouTube is such an answer - ‚ÄúWho are you?  Come on davidanya! ‚Äù, Nobody needs him there. <br></div></div><br><br>  So, there is a task: to make video reviews about the courses of our training center.  I will try to present the entire methodology in the form of answers to the questions that I set myself before making the commercials. <br><br><h4>  What is the duration of the video? </h4><br>  I think that optimally from 2 to 3, maximum 5 minutes.  The shorter the better.  If the videos are longer, then this will be a grafomanic video.  And then there are other laws.  For a short ad, the following requirements: conciseness and brevity of the text within the meaning - when I explain to the person who will be filming our videos (this is a simple employee - not a showman), imagine that you are going in an elevator, and you have time to talk about your business, only while the elevator goes.  Then the man himself cleans his speech from unnecessary parts and debris, and speaks only about the main thing. <br><br>  NB: When installing, the general principle is - the very best - to go ahead of the video, because the chances that this is important will increase when this plot is at the beginning of the video. <br><br><h4>  How many reviews should be in the video? </h4><br>  There should be 3 reviews.  Since 1 or even 2 is a little somehow, and 3 just right. <br>  What should be the questions to the participants of the training? <br>  Presentation: What is your name?  Company?  Position?  Field of activity? <br>  You ask so not to put it in the video, and then to remember who they are called, and then put in the captions.  After you have made the captions, send the person a screenshot with captions - like, everything is ok? <br><br><ul><li>  What are your impressions of the course / training / seminar? </li><li>  What did you like?  What did not like? </li><li>  How do you evaluate the work and competence of the coach / instructor / teacher? </li><li>  How do you rate the overall work of the MUK Training Center? </li></ul><br><br>  The general principle is this: everything that a person says is divided into 2 parts: <br><br>  1. The assessment of the course itself, the program, the instructor should be in one part. <br>  2. Evaluation of the organization, venue, tea and coffee, etc. - in another part of the mini-interview. <br><br>  What is it for?  Because if there is something wrong in the organization, so that it does not transfer to the course and to the innocent instructor, and vice versa. <br><br>  Regarding honesty reviews.  There really is a moment of courage, and everyone decides what to do with it - even if they say something not very pleasant, then, of course, the management may not miss this review, but, on the other hand, if they made some comment - then you need an answer.  Immediately after the recall-question: there should be an answer from the organizer that we are working on errors, etc.  This will show that you are not afraid of criticism and honestly admit your mistakes, and are open to dialogue.  We have not had such video reviews so far, if they do, then they should also work, because if everything is sweet, it becomes cloying. <br><br><h4>  What should be interruptions? </h4><br>  Panorama class with students - it is imperative that the viewer saw the learning process. <br>  Instructor certificates (if any).  And if they say, the instructor estimates, there must be his certificates. <br>  Average plans: people discuss something lively, people write something, the instructor shows something on the blackboard.  Written board on the topic.  If there is laboratory work - a screen with exercises, manuals and handouts. <br>  Close-ups: attentive listener (2-3 plans of the listener), a pen on the table, someone writes in the outline <br>  General plans: the presentation of the certificate - required + applause at the ceremony. <br><br><h5>  Duration of interruptions? </h5><br>  3-5 seconds. <br>  Easy hitting can be used if you want to focus on something.  Or if you put photos - you can, too, only a slight hitting is necessary - this adds inconspicuous dynamics, the photo is static. <br><br><h5>  The number of interruptions? </h5><br>  10, and better than 15. To have plenty to choose from. <br><br><h4>  How should the entire lectures take shape? </h4><br>  On a black screen in white letters: Seminar theme, presenter (regalia), vendors, venue, date, city.  To make it clear what the lecture is about, because even if you have your own video on the site, where there will be signatures of what the video is about, people can watch these videos from a list of what YouTube recommends users who are interested in this topic, such as ITIL or PMbok. <br><br><h4>  What should be the dies under the credits? </h4><br>  Plain, simple color.  You can, of course, make all sorts of overflows and transitions there - but who will appreciate it?  After all, watching this video is not looking at your captions, but whether to decide whether to go for this course, whether to go to this training center? <br><br>  We have a red color in the logo, so we had to tinker a bit, since the red color is torn off by the scraps when rendering - so there should not be a bright red.  There is already a color set, this will be, but, of course, not pink. <br><br><h4>  What size should be captions with captions about a person? </h4><br>  Titles should be a little more.  Since when you watch your video on the monitor, this is one thing, but you will upload this video to YouTube - it will digest it, it will be smaller, and no one will read your letters.  After all, no one rolls videos on YouTube to full screen (there are but few). <br><br><h4>  When loading video on YouTube </h4><br>  It is necessary to indicate in the title of the video - briefly - the essence of the video.  To even before you start watching your video a person already understood what he sees.  Since there is nothing worse, if a person is going to watch the feils (and it is written in the title of the video), and some pornography is shown to him, this leads to video flagging - the viewer cannot be deceived. <br><br><h4>  Be sure to add a description of the video </h4><br>  Do not add a description - you are depriving yourself of the part of the audience that does not watch your video from the site / mailing list, etc., but from YouTube, youtube can recommend watching your videos by likes and preferences of users.  This is what it was all about, and here it all depends on what you want to say: the phone?  Site?  Mail?  We had a task - this is recognizability of the site of our training center - therefore, in the captions (and in the video itself) there is a link to the section of the necessary courses, and to the website itself - a person can choose from the links. <br><br><h4>  Be sure to pick tags </h4><br>  There you are.  There is <a href="http://wordstat.yandex.ru/">wordstat.yandex.ru</a> - he will tell you everything. <br><br><h4>  Using music </h4><br>  The issue of copyright YouTube keeps it very holy.  What can I say from my own experience, if you put some kind of music on - then youtube usually immediately find and a letter comes to you, like ‚Äúboy, your video violates copyrights, it will be blocked‚Äù - i.e.  the video will be, but there will be no sound (and if you are a malicious violator - they can block the account too - so be careful with this), or it will be blocked in some countries, according to the law of which you violate the rules for using this audio.  But, if you put music under the words, if the music sounds for a few seconds during the interruptions, the words are the words of the intermixes, the words are the words of the word, the intermixes - then youtube it does not look like a copyright violation. <br><br><h4>  Use of knocks </h4><br>  Cut-outs, by the way, serve as semantic delimiters for plots, as a paragraph mark in a video.  This is if between plots, and if inside a plot (usually eyes or hands of a person), they go for assembly gluing - if a person plentifully pours his speech - Eeeeee - and this irrelevance must be cut out so that the gluing cannot be seen, then these interruptions. <br><br>  Here, for example, that we have removed from this.  I‚Äôll say right away when we figured out how much the operator and editor would be hiring - and if you do it all the time (including the permanent format), you can go broke, you decided that you should try to take it off yourself.  Moreover, as I said, YouTube does not require a hard quality.  But when it comes to TV - there it is, there everything is according to the canon - there is glamor and grace. <br><br>  Yes, I forgot - during the breaks, when you show plans - that people are busy with something, they learn - you have 2 words to say about the essence of the passing: like, the training lasts 2 days, consists of a theoretical and practical part - so that people Immediately received information about what will be at the training. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/qA4z098iSl0%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700022,15700186,15700191,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhh2SZg2qg2smdn9dmRnaL8VbUei2g" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/dEzibseMhNc%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700022,15700186,15700191,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhhVkEv8CU0XKC0vYN46zrOqIOIHMQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/LxBluJYGGuk%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700022,15700186,15700191,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhgzAFAEzXqZrD18AFSFjdPLLTQztA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/1RMGwgL9cQo%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700022,15700186,15700191,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhimC27WQhBAHNtq6StTSee4TA4Nlw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  In this case, we had a seminar that was filmed, but there were no video reviews that were taken.
