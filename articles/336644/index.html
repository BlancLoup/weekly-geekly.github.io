In the last issue we <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/post/335738/">studied the</a> sales of tokens held in the summer, and in today's topic - a selection of the most interesting ICO of September. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h2>  <a href="https://ico.snov.io/">SNOVio</a> : decentralized <a href="https://ico.snov.io/">lead generation</a> platform </h2><br>  Any computer can become a source of important business data, if you teach it to search for it correctly.  Today, many lead generation platforms use centralized search and data storage models (for example, the Hunter.io email search system), but the creators of the SNOVio project are confident that decentralization is a force.

    <img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/67c/bd3/161/67cbd3161f604ad589f939ed5d481cb1.png"><br><br>  The platform created by the project team works on the basis of blockchain technology and smart contracts.  To fill the database using crowdsourcing information collected by search bots from open sources. <br><br>  System members are rewarded for keeping their data up to date.  This means that the business gets better leads than when working with traditional lead generation systems.  The details of all transactions between platform participants and customers are stored in a separate register, transactions are processed using smart contracts. <br><br><blockquote>  ICO project is scheduled for September 19: <a href="https://ico.snov.io/">www.ico.snov.io</a> </blockquote><br><h2>  <a href="https://datum.network/">Datum</a> : decentralized NOSQL database </h2><br>  The Datum service is a decentralized and distributed highly loaded NOSQL database, working on blockchain technology.  The system allows any user to create backup copies of structured data ‚Äî for example, dumps of information from social networks, wearables, and IoT devices ‚Äî and store them anonymously, share them, or sell them using a special marketplace. <br><br>  The system works like this: the system uses its own DAT token, data owners use this currency to pay for data storage in the system on special repository nodes - their operators make money on it. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/14d/a4f/ac3/14da4fac3c5f4dbdbc02b9ed221df86d.png"><br><br>  Using DAT tokens, you can also buy data - the terms of the transaction are determined by their owner.  For payment you do not need to deal with complex wallets, all transactions are carried out using a simple mobile application. <br><br><blockquote>  At the moment there is a project pre-sale, ICO starts on September 11: <br>  <a href="https://datum.network/">www.datum.network</a> </blockquote><br><h2>  <a href="https://www.monetha.io/">Monetha</a> : blockchain system for payments and reputation tracking </h2><br>  For centuries, one of the most important factors in any sales transaction is trust between the two parties.  Despite the development of the financial system, the truly viable and easy-to-use tools for reducing risk during transactions have not appeared - the creators of the Monetha project are confident. <br><br>  They have developed their own payment system, the distinguishing feature of which is the presence of an integrated decentralized reputation assessment system based on a smart contract.  Its essence lies in the fact that after the transaction is completed, the seller and the buyer can evaluate each other, and important information about the transaction (for example, about the warranty provided) is recorded in the blockchain.  As a result, each seller and buyer will have his own rating of trust and feedback about him. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/53f/9bd/345/53f9bd345203468e84f0a10697fdf341.png"><br><br>  In addition to greater reliability, Monetha developers have made their payment gateway cheaper to use than traditional solutions - instead of the usual commission of 2% -6%, the transaction fee here is only 1.5%. <br><br><blockquote>  ICO project starts on August 31 and will run until September 30: <a href="https://www.monetha.io/">www.monetha.io</a> </blockquote><br><h2>  <a href="https://ambrosus.com/">Ambrosus</a> : improving the quality of products using the blockchain </h2><br>  Modern global supply chains of vital products, such as food or medicine, do not give people the ability to control what they use - the developers of Ambrosus think so.  The main goal of the project is to drastically improve the situation by creating a blockchain-ecosystem in which records of the history of each product would be kept.  This should significantly increase the level of confidence in the entire global distribution system of products and medicines. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/OkdCV6zw3lI" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  The essence of the system is to give consumers the opportunity to track the history of any product - from the place of its creation to the full composition.  To collect data, it is planned to create specialized biosensors that will be used to create products.  Among the investors of the project are Swiss authorities. <br><br><blockquote>  ICO is scheduled for September 13: <a href="https://ambrosus.com/">www.ambrosus.com</a> </blockquote><br><h2>  <a href="https://synchrolife.org/ico.html">SynchroLife</a> : recommendation system for finding restaurants </h2><br>  Today, when new restaurants appear every day and old ones just as often close, it is difficult for consumers to track these changes.  As a result, it is rather difficult to understand what to expect from a particular institution.  This problem seeks to solve the project SynchroLife - a blockchain-based recommender platform for finding restaurants. <br><br>  The scheme of its work is simple - users of the system can publish reviews of restaurants in which they visited, and earn internal system tokens (SynchroCoin).  This information is then analyzed by an algorithm that generates personal recommendations. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/3d2/4e8/ecb/3d24e8ecb52e4a36a929afd6d0506d95.png"><br><br><blockquote>  SynchroLife tokens sale scheduled for September 8: <a href="https://synchrolife.org/ico.html">www.synchrolife.org/ico.html</a> </blockquote><br>  <i>And what interesting future ICO do you know?</i> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/336644/">https://habr.com/ru/post/336644/</a></p>
