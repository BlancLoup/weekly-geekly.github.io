  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Content Exchange Etxt.ru - the source of high-quality and cheap content</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/8b0/838/48f/8b083848f82e49883c0063207661bf14.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h4>  Good day, dear Habrasoobschestvo! </h4><br>  I was asked to promote a resource on Habr√© such as the <a href="http://www.etxt.ru/">Etxt.ru copywriting exchange</a> .  I will do it with pleasure. <br>  So, let's start with the fact that this resource may be of interest to those who make money online by creating websites for people and search engine optimization.  For the webmaster (we will call SEO politically correct :)) it is very important to have a constant source of cheap, but at the same time sufficient quality content. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  There are several options for extracting content for sites: <br><ul><li>  copywriting; </li><li>  rewriting; </li><li>  synonymization; </li><li>  reproduction; </li><li>  scanning. </li></ul><br>  For obvious reasons, the first two are the most acceptable options.  The latter can also serve as a source, but, unfortunately, violates the copyright law.  I think in the light of recent events few people will want to be in the field of view of the famous radioactive waste :). <br>  Either of the two chosen methods requires the use of copywriters.  Moreover, you can work directly with a freelance copywriter, and through the content exchange. <br>  When working with a single copywriter, you expose your business to several risks at once: <br><ol><li>  <b>The contract with a freelancer, as a rule, is not concluded.</b>  So no one is insured against default on time.  In addition to bad faith, a freelancer may simply get sick or take a more expensive order and disappear, having decided that he is no longer interested in your order.  And if you work on a prepaid basis - disappear with it.  Agree, it is quite unpleasant. </li><li>  <b>Finding a responsible and hardworking copywriter</b> (moreover, with the rates that suit you) <b>can take more than one week.</b>  And no one is immune from the fact that the newcomer who has gained experience can at any time raise prices.  So, the search will have to be repeated again. </li><li>  <b>Copywriter - also a man.</b>  And creative.  He is not able to single-handedly prepare too large amounts of text.  According to our own observations: it is impossible to write more than 15 thousand characters of a truly high-quality text per day.  And if you need 50 thousand? </li><li>  Sometimes a <b>creative crisis</b> can occur in the mind of a copywriter when he cannot write a good text. </li></ol><br>  <a href="http://www.etxt.ru/">The content exchange Etxt.ru</a> is designed to solve all these problems.  How?  To do this, the exchange functionality provides a large variety of tools. <br>  And among other undoubted advantages are the following: <br><ol><li>  <b>Work through the exchange Etxt.ru safe.</b>  You can be sure that the copywriter will not be lost with your money.  And he, in turn, is that you will not disappear without paying a previously known amount for the received text. </li><li>  <b>More than two hundred ‚Äúhungry‚Äù authors who are ready to take up work at any time are constantly on duty at the exchange.</b>  That is, your order will not be ignored.  You can communicate with the performers not only through personal messages, but also in the chat. </li><li>  <b>The exchange gathered authors with a variety of training and experience</b> - from beginners to masters of their craft.  You will be able to choose exactly the author that you need.  The system of rating and skill levels that are set by the exchange moderators after performing the test task will come to the rescue. </li><li>  <b>It is possible to create white and black lists of artists.</b>  If you do not want to ‚Äúshine‚Äù your order in front of everyone, then you can create an individual order.  It will be visible only to you and the selected artist. </li><li>  <b>The cost of thousands of characters on the resource varies within very wide limits</b> - from 7 to 500 rubles.  The quality of the texts is proportional to the price.  But it should be borne in mind that the competition on the resource among the performers is quite high, so that the average price of texts is much lower than that of freelance freelancers. </li><li>  In addition, <b>there are always a large number of newbies who are ready to work selflessly for small amounts</b> in order to gain the coveted rating and begin to somehow compete with those who have already managed to positively recommend themselves. </li><li>  Since more than 10 thousand performers are registered on the stock exchange, one can be sure that even the largest volume will be produced in the near future. </li><li>  <b>Copywriters sell a large number of ready-made articles on the stock exchange</b> , so it is possible that you will find everything you need in a few minutes. </li></ol><br>  As you can see, the Etxt.ru content exchange is a good opportunity to solve the problem of finding cheap and high-quality content. </div>
