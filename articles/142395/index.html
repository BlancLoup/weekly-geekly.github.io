    <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  This year the forum was attended by more than 5,500 people!  The main task of <a href="http://iforum.ua/programma">iForum</a> - ‚Äúcontact between people and exchange of ideas‚Äù was 100% complete.  The speakers stayed relaxed, which only fueled interest among the audience. <br><br>  <b>Anton Borisovich Nosik</b> , a well-known blogger and one of the ‚ÄúRunet fathers‚Äù, especially distinguished himself, and not even with his report that LiveJournal still outlives us.  And with a private conversation with the audience already on the street near the venue, where for 5 hours (!!!) Anton Borisovich answered the questions, expressing his opinion about the development trends of the blogosphere, the lack of competitiveness of most social networks, Google + errors in marketing and working with his The audience, as well as shared the alternative view that the online revolution is ‚Äúan idea imposed by the security services.‚Äù  Reviews of the speaker's speech flooded the Internet before the end of the event. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/fcb/607/a49/fcb607a49df37e6c20ac805015606a2e.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The forum was opened by the son of the current president of Ukraine - <b>Viktor Viktorovich Yanukovych</b> .  Viktor Viktorovich suggested adding on his Facebook page and together discussing the development program of the Ukrainian Internet, in which he intends to include: <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ cancellation of blocking resources without a court decision <br>  ‚Ä¢ release of content providers <br>  ‚Ä¢ legalization of electronic documents <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/914/0a0/9db/9140a09db979370f26eba47faf759a30.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Throughout the course, the iForum could have been pampered in a room full of toys and easy chairs. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/4cf/9f5/51a/4cf9f551a8c3200cd395ab7b4cbf4a7e.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Speakers from <b>Microsoft, Google, Facebook, MyAsterisk, Megaplan, 1C-Bitrix, Yandex</b> , etc. presented their reports.  The overall looseness of the speakers was rewarded with the most positive feedback from the audience. <br><br>  There was even an on-site trade at the studio of Art. Lebedev Studio. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b26/eca/80e/b26eca80e41f81dbe0600f09d8cfa0cb.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>Dmitry Satin</b> , the head of Usability Lab, gathered this sold-out in the evening, with a report that in most cases it‚Äôs not the design and functionality on the site that needs to be changed, but the approach to business and the attitude to the buyer. <br><br>  <b><a href="http://www.myasterisk.ru/">MyAsterisk</a></b> team performed in the flow of "Technology" in prime time.  Our report on innovations in the field of corporate telephony gathered an impressive amount of feedback from the audience. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a37/f69/215/a37f692150ff8946f8b91ccb4df0190a.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The modern business structure has become more complex, requiring a more high-tech approach.  The actual problem has become the search path opportunities to customize the infrastructure of the organization for its individual needs.  Those.  expanding the capabilities of integrating an IP telephony platform with applications, CRM systems, etc., to ensure mobility and flexibility of business structures. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c94/300/ab2/c94300ab2f3154a37ddaa1bdf21e89d7.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  We paid attention to the integration of Asterisk with IPhone and Android applications.  After all, these solutions are extremely beneficial for sales, because  Significantly facilitate the communication of supply departments with couriers, drivers and other employees engaged in the sale of the company's products. <br><br>  The need to replace the organization‚Äôs SIP phones with Lyns has disappeared thanks to our innovative developments in the integration of Asterisk and Microsoft Lync.  In the same area, we are successfully working on the Asterisk SoftPhone base in the Office Communications Server environment, which allowed us to use the functions of video and audio conferences provided by OCS. <br><br>  There were many questions about our recent development - the organization of call centers.  This topic was obviously close to the public, and our decisions turned out to be extremely relevant for modern giants of the high-tech industry. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/360/e93/f64/360e93f644006c2988167fd0808280a8.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  At the end of the section, we participated in a round table on the development of modern technologies.  Ukrainian <a href="http://iforum.ua/programma">IForum</a> , as we have already noticed, is distinguished by the utmost openness and tendencies to non-format communication.  So even the usual discussion of development trends turned into an informal conversation, where questions and answers were not only exhaustive, but also filled with a sense of the speaker‚Äôs personal involvement in the field of their activities.  We felt a personal attitude to the presentations of all participants, from this - the willingness to defend their point of view, give examples, go into the smallest details for a better understanding of the audience. <br><br>  At the very closing, Alex Mas presented the book ‚ÄúThe Secrets of Internet Marketing‚Äù, the first copy of which was sold for UAH 400 at an auction. <br><br>  After leaving the official part, the participants were finally able to communicate outside of their reports and companies at the afterparty.  Our team managed to establish a friendly conversation with <b>Anton Nosik</b> - the most active participant in the forum, <b>Alexey Mas</b> , judging by the recommendations and feedback is a really interesting book. <br>  The company <a href="http://www.myasterisk.ru/">MyAsterisk has</a> left the most positive feedback about the event.  Be sure to go in 2013! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/142395/">https://habr.com/ru/post/142395/</a></p>
