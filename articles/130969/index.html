  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Housing and IT - myth or reality?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><h4>  Hello, dear Habrazhiteli. </h4><br>  There is a great desire to bring to the community our prototype of the future service on housing and utilities (not cut, but sorry), and also if possible to find supporters and / or investors. <br><br>  I will not describe in great detail here, if I am interested, I will tell everything as it is in a separate correspondence. <br><br>  It all started with the fact that I was introduced to the head of our city.  He asked him to develop a small portal for daily consumption of energy resources for the needs of the administration (UEC - a single settlement energy center).  Data had to be entered by each organization in manual mode.  In DES, there are servers for which these data are collected automatically, and accordingly, these data were planned to be further bolted to the portal being developed. <br>  For a bottle of beer with a friend, we decided to take on this project.  Work began on April 15, 2011 (yes - yes, we are half a year). <br>  Our administration is poor, did not want to pay money (and does not want to), it was planned to collect a subscription fee from organizations that will keep records in the EHEC, and also in the future for automating the process of water data in this very journal.  The plans did not come true (for many reasons). <br>  At the moment, 170 organizations, more than 100 users, are registered with the UREC, to date, more than 53,000 readings from general metering devices have been kept. <br>  A system of reports with an arbitrary choice of periods has been developed, a comparative report allows you to select two periods and compare data on them.

Allows residents of the city (while using authorization through a well-known social network) to apply online for any emergency work.  The managing organization (housing department, housing office, homeowners association - who has which organization) to which the applicant‚Äôs address belongs, accepts the application for execution, appoints the performer, makes a note about the application execution.  The resident who submitted this application can track the status of the application in his office.  There is one more plus when a performer is appointed, then a resident can see a photo of the person who should come to him.  It follows that to you, on request, to replace the crane, the fraudster will not come.  After the employee (locksmith) does the work, the applicant can leave feedback on the quality of the work done, in which case the application can be considered completed.  If the applicant does not make any marks, the manager of the management organization notes that the request has been completed. <br><br>  Local governments review information on the number and quality of completed / outstanding applications, and draw conclusions about the quality of the services provided by managing organizations to the public. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f43/5f4/0eb/f435f40eb6b6122b9d739896f1350327.png" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>Dispatching</b> is a system of on-line data analysis from general home metering devices with output of results and warnings to the map. <br>  General view of the map with the technical characteristics of the house: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/69d/b62/c96/69db62c9647128be19fe90be95f39dd0.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Card with electric general home counters.  in the right part you can see all the parameters for the selected counter: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/761/5d4/605/7615d460599dedc407c1da86a0059477.png" alt="image"><br><br>  The system is partially implemented and works in the city of Ishimbay. <br><br>  Plans for the further development of the system very much.

The project is very risky, but if it burns out, the financial support will not be small. <br><br>  Unfortunately, I can only give a link to the project in personal correspondence (or if you find it yourself) due to habraeffect, because  while hosted on what came to hand. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/130969/">https://habr.com/ru/post/130969/</a></p>
