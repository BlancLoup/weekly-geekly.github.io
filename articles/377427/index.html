All the mistakes of the students, all the techniques and techniques of effective study will be considered at this training.  More than 100 thousand people are willing to participate. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The author of the course, Barbara Oakley, will explain the latest research in cognitive psychology and neurology.  He will tell about his practical experience of teaching particularly complicated courses at the university.  In general, the goal of the course is to teach how to learn correctly, to explain how the process of memorizing new information, its assimilation and consolidation takes place. <br><br>  Barbara Oakley herself, now being a doctor in the field of system design, according to her, cannot boast of success in her student life.  Especially - in mathematics.  Nevertheless, the personal experience of Barbara Oakley gave her to develop their own methods of improving the effectiveness of training.  And she outlined these techniques in her book, a brief squeeze from which we give below.

    <h5>  <font color="009900">‚ñå10 Commandments of the Wicked Losers</font> </h5><br>  You can regularly follow them and never achieve at least some results in school. <br><br>  1. To be <i>distracted by extraneous things</i> .  Your friend wrote to you on Skype and instantly took away from your brain some of the possibilities for memorization.  If you are absolutely not immersed in the work, you are working in half the power. <br><br>  2. <i>Appreciate the time of the teacher and never ask him clarifying questions</i> .  You will be a very delicate young man, but your brain will not be able to assimilate the received information qualitatively, if it does not decompose its details. <br><br>  3. <i>Consider yourself smarter than any textbook and immediately begin the practice</i> .  You risk being as clumsy as a bear performed by the final act of the Swan Lake ballet. <br><br>  4. <i>Turn study lessons with friends into lively chatter about the personal life of friends</i> .  To discuss someone behind the eyes is not only ugly, but also harmful.  In the classroom with friends there is a great temptation to distract from boring tasks to burning topics. <br><br>  5. <i>Always decide the same thing that you already know how</i> .  You are standing in the same place as before.  You do not develop. <br><br>  6. <i>Delay the Doomsday of the start of classes until the last moment</i> .  It is much worse to suffer from sadness at the thought of what was done than to get carried away with educational tasks, but if you are a bad student, you must suffer so much. <br><br>  7. <i>Peek into the solution of the problem</i> .  And inspire yourself that now everything is clear.  It‚Äôs necessary to go through the solution yourself. <br><br>  8. <i>Gently emphasize important places</i> .  It seems to you that this will really help you?  But no.  You do not train your hand in monotonous movements. <br><br>  9. <i>Re-read the same thing, without delving into the essence</i> .  Ask yourself: what do you understand from the read?  If you cannot answer, you firmly follow this commandment. <br><br>  10. <i>Do not get enough sleep.</i>  When you are not sleeping enough, your neural connections of the brain are destroyed by toxins - this sleepy morning you think much worse than last night.  You can relax and go get a deuce - no repetition will help you. <br><br>  Sign up for courses here: <a href="https://www.coursera.org/ucsd">www.coursera.org/ucsd</a> <br><br>  <i>And you can create your own effective course on the platform</i> <br> <a href="http://teachbase.ru/landing/%3Futm_medium%3Dpost%26utm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_content%3DPost_160315"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b54/c26/9b1/b54c269b17a34122ba31a7f80eadd238.PNG"></a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/377427/">https://habr.com/ru/post/377427/</a></p>
