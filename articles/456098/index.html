The legendary hacker galaxy L0pht, speaking in full in the Senate before a meeting of the most influential Western officials, said: ‚ÄúYour computerized equipment is vulnerable to cyber attacks from the Internet.  ...  Manufacturers do not care at all about this state of affairs, because modern legislation does not provide for any liability for a negligent approach to ensuring cybersecurity.  Responsibility for potential failures lies with the user of the equipment.

For example, decisions on narrowband radio access.  For example, we developed the first and, so far, the only domestic LpWAN-module IoT with support for LTE CAT-M1 / NB1 technology, which is recognized as one of the most promising according to the ‚ÄúConcept of building and developing narrow-band wireless communication networks of the‚Äú Internet of things ‚Äùin the Russian Federation‚Äù .  This concept was developed in the framework of the Information Infrastructure project Digital Economy. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/hv/mr/a6/hvmra6madefl5fbrjiecwy_ljzk.jpeg"><br>  The module operates at an LTE 450 MHz frequency and can be used to connect any IoT devices to the enterprise backbone through narrowband wireless access networks. <br><br>  In order to ensure the protection of the transmitted information, the module uses an IMSP certified to the KB1 level of the requirements of the Federal Security Service of Russia. <br><br>  At the moment, the main application of the module is the construction of smart power supply networks (Smart Grid).  For this task, the module is used in conjunction with specialized IIOT controllers developed by BULAT. <br><br>  To build core networks of enterprises, we develop a domestic telecommunications platform based on our own circuit design and hardware production, as well as ODM.  At the heart of the platform is the first and so far the only domestic network operating system of carrier class BulatOS. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/xl/tb/vr/xltbvrwg_cr0jpz4ot1gqjutsre.jpeg"><br></div></div></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/456098/">https://habr.com/ru/post/456098/</a></p>
