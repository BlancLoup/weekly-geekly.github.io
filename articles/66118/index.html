  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How does DHL work?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Some time ago I bought three pieces of jeans and one belt in an online store.  The delivery in the store turned out to be only through DHL, so I had to use their services, for the delivery I paid something around $ 60.  Remembering our customs code, the purchase amount did not exceed 5,000 rubles (this is the limit for commercial delivery services).  Actually, after the order, literally one day, my package was collected, packed and transferred by DHL.  I was given the invoice number and I could track the entire cargo route.  It was just great!  Within a few days, the parcel crossed the Atlantic and arrived in my city.  This is where the problems started. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Arriving in Nizhny Novgorod, the status of the parcel changed to ‚Äúcustoms clearance‚Äù, I was sure that it would not take a lot of time, because the amount did not exceed the limit of unsolicited imports.  The next day, a girl from DHL called me and informed me that I should fax them a copy of my passport + registration and an information letter in which I had to indicate what I was waiting for and for what purpose I was going to use it.  Actually, I sent all this to her by email and waited. <br>  And after two weeks (!) I became intensely interested in why my cargo goes through customs for so long.  I sent a complaint through the form on the dhl site.  Pretty quickly the answer came to me: <br><blockquote>  Good afternoon, Eugene! <br><br>  On behalf of DHL Express, allow me to pay my respects to you and thank you for your letter regarding the cargo sent by airway bill 9188473840. First of all, please accept our sincere apologies for having to worry about the fate of your package. <br><br>  Please allow me to explain the situation.

      Your shipment was accepted for shipment on July 10 of this year.  On July 15, the shipment arrived at the DHL customs terminal in Nizhny Novgorod to further organize the customs clearance process. <br><br>  According to the customs code of the Russian Federation, an average of 3 working days is allocated for cargo clearance.  Unfortunately, due to the restructuring that took place in the Nizhny Novgorod customs in May of this year, there are now delays in customs clearance of goods, and in no way can we affect the work of the customs authorities.  Believe us, we are doing everything possible to speed up and regulate the process of customs clearance.  Cargo will be delivered to you immediately as soon as it is released from customs.  Yevgeny, did you provide passport data and an information letter to our customs department? <br></blockquote><br>  Actually, I was eager to talk more, but it did not work out: <br><blockquote>  Eugene, I can not read your letter, unfortunately !!!  Please send again. <br></blockquote><br>  Well, I was very upset that our services as always can not do anything.  But what was my surprise that after some time I received a call from DHL again and said that I should send them a scan of a copy of my passport again to another email.  Well, nothing to do, I send them a letter, and in the end I asked to confirm his receipt, I must say that I did not receive confirmation?  Instead, by calling the dhl office in Nizhny Novgorod, I learned that they could not verify receipt of the letter and I need to call customs brokers.  Naturally, I called the received number and after two or three beeps I received a click and a call reset, the repeated attempt was also unsuccessful.  While unsuccessfully trying to call customs brokers in the main office, the working day was over and they simply did not pick up the phone. <br>  Next week (on weekends dhl work only on Saturday until 13), that is, today, I call dhl and ask to find out if they received my letters, and refuse to call back someone there instead of giving them my phone number and invoice.  During the day, no one called the phone, but I received an email: <br><blockquote>  Good afternoon, Eugene. <br><br>  Thank you for sending copies of the documents, on the basis of which an application for customs clearance of your cargo was submitted on 07/30/09. <br><br>  The customs inspector has the following questions: what kind of decorative jewelry precious or base metal, what stones ??  And what kind of jeans came in a number of 3 pieces (new or used, husband or wives). <br><br>  Please, kindly provide this information in the form of an information letter on the model: <br><br>  In Nizhny Novgorod customs <br><br>  Information mail. <br><br>  In my address on the invoice 988473840 from the USA came ,,,,,,,,,,, <br><br>  date <br><br>  Signature. <br></blockquote><br>  Here you can see that they tried to do something only on the 30th (the load was already 15 in the city).  Actually here my patience ended and through a friend working in customs, it was found that: <br>  1. There was no restructuring of customs (there was only some sort of decree regarding commercial carriers, but no more). <br>  2. Since in the package there is a belt prescribed as jewelry without an exact inventory (which DHL should have issued when sending), an examination may be made. <br>  3. Today, people from DHL actually came to the customs point, but did not write applications for customs clearance because they simply <b>do not have the money for this</b> (which is actually included in the cost of delivery). <br><br>  <b>And so it turns out that DHL just pulls time because they have no money to pay customs duties.</b> <br>  <a href="http://www.dhl.ru/publish/ru/ru/eshipping/track.high.html%3FpageToInclude%3DRESULTS%26AWB%3D9188473840%26type%3Dfasttrack">Trekking parcel</a> <br>  <b>UPD:</b> Transferred to E-commerce. <br>  <b>UPD 2:</b> Today, on August 6, the parcel finally passed customs, as I was told the parcel was opened to make sure that it was not jewelry.  Most likely tomorrow I will receive a package, I wondered if this article worked or I just got them on the phone :) <br>  <b>UPD 3:</b> All received the package, hurray :) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/66118/">https://habr.com/ru/post/66118/</a></p>
