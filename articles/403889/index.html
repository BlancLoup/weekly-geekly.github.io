  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Fishing! Gadgets that you can take with you to the river</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Fishing gadgets are a very specific niche, because the hobby is very ‚Äúconservative‚Äù.  Many go fishing not for fish - there is a shop for this.  And, nevertheless, something interesting is being created in this category.  Let's look at some inventions. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/eff/b01/622/effb01622d5b4621888fb95a2e8cdfbc.jpg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Probably the most popular fishing gadget would be an echo sounder.  The number of devices is estimated in dozens, and very large brands are noticed in the creation, take at least Garmin. <br><br>  Of the smart echo sounders (those that are synchronized with the smartphone), Deeper <a href="http://medgadgets.ru/shop/deeper.html%3Futm_source%3Dgeek%26utm_medium%3Dfishing%26utm_campaign%3Ddeeper">products are the</a> most famous.

      A successful acquisition will be the younger model, which costs <a href="http://medgadgets.ru/shop/deeper-smart-fishfinder-smart-jeholot.html%3Futm_source%3Dgeek%26utm_medium%3Dfishing%26utm_campaign%3Ddeeper">about 10,000</a> .  The miniature echo sounder has high autonomy - up to two days of fishing, has a stable Bluetooth signal at a distance of up to 40 meters and is universal for summer and winter fishing. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/ca4/91f/6c3/ca491f6c384247e999a3b3e499303bf6.jpg"><br><br>  The main task that he solves: the analysis of the relief of the reservoir and the demonstration of the presence of fish.  At the same time, he doesn‚Äôt need additional remote screens - Deeper works in tandem with a proprietary application. <br><br>  Another interesting project on the same topic that deserves attention is the echo sounder-clock.  The smartphone is certainly convenient, always near, but in some moments even its dimensions can become a hindrance. <br><br>  Given this, the company Humminbird introduced the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Humminbird-Waterproof-Fishfinder-Discontinued-Manufacturer/dp/B0009PSA1M/">SmartCast RF35</a> , a watch that, apparently, is now difficult to access. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/402/ea9/d79/402ea9d790df4de5a130dfb7de1d9db0.jpg"></div><br>  They worked in tandem with a locator, and all the necessary information: in our case - the presence of fish - was displayed on a simple digital display.  At the same time, both hands remained free and there was no need for additional distractions. <br><br>  The problem of "visualization of fish places" can be solved in different ways.  In this regard, they also decided to make special cameras, one of which, the so-called ‚ÄúFishing Camera‚Äù, spread all over the world and even reached Aliexpress. <br><br>  In the "classic" form, it <a href="http://www.ebay.com/itm/Eyoyo-Original-1000TVL-Underwater-Ice-Video-Fishing-Camera-Fish-Finder-15m-Cable-/132085263805">is</a> on Ebay, for example.  It costs about a hundred dollars. <br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/5f0/bd6/ff4/5f0bd6ff4bdb4bafb0eebb3ef43dd269.png"></div><br>  The kit consists of two parts: a small display that can be mounted directly on the bait, and a camera in the form of a ‚Äútrimmed‚Äù float, which is mounted above the hook. <br><br>  With a similar initiative in the past year, a team of domestic developers made a speech: in April 2016 a float with a camera <a href="http://fishingfancam.com/">Fishing FanCam</a> appeared on Kickstarter. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/5ed/4fe/93c/5ed4fe93c9844de88744a404928ca021.png"><br><br>  Unfortunately, at what stage this project is now unknown.  But its main advantage can be called the fact that the camera did not become an extra element.  Well float and float.  And with or without a camera - that‚Äôs what happened. <br><br>  <a href="https://anglr.com/">Anglr</a> Fisher <a href="https://anglr.com/">Tracker</a> is one of the strangest devices.  On the other hand, there are trackers for swimming, golf, football, for boxing ... Fishing is also a sport, why not make a tracker for fishing? <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/905/f1b/990/905f1b99053a4f349610eabe38e6f9b7.jpg"><br><br>  The device does not help to catch fish, but it will record throws and ‚Äúachievements‚Äù of the fisherman, keeping the data in the smartphone: where they left the bait, where they caught it, and will help to make a very accurate map of fishing success. <br><br>  As an alternative to echo sounders, cameras that help to find out where the fish are, for very lazy fishermen, smart lures were offered.  The logic is: why look for a fish place, if you can call the fish.  One such project was <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/jackadanos/the-fish-call-the-future-of-fishing">on Kickstarter</a> - Fish Call. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/95d/0e6/44e/95d0e644e45c430588ca543871196e3e.jpg"><br><br>  The gadget was thrown into the water and imitated the vibration and other signals that were supposed (God, how it works) to remind the fish the natural sounds of the feeding process.  The fish had to go to the call and - ha ha, got caught! <br><br>  Well, if these guys didn‚Äôt really explain anything, then we‚Äôll go to science.  In fact, many years of research have been devoted to smart bait, and first of all you should start with <a href="http://www.lsu.edu/highlights/2010/01/lure.shtml">the BioPulse project</a> . <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/5b7/063/814/5b7063814c7540b187d3ab61635703ff.jpg"></div><br>  The idea of ‚Äã‚Äãcreation belongs to the doctor of biological sciences, who devoted three decades to the study of fish sensory systems.  As a result, he developed the bait, which acts as a stimulus to the nervous system of the fish, activating (God, how it works) the taste patches, and the fish can no longer swallow the bait.  The article referenced above has an email address to which questions can be sent.  Project sites are currently not working. <br><br>  Another device from the series for the lazy " <a href="http://www.hammacher.com/Product/Default.aspx%3Fsku%3D86966">boat-fishing rod</a> ."  Indeed, why swim or go along the coast itself, when you can control a miniature boat. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/eff/b01/622/effb01622d5b4621888fb95a2e8cdfbc.jpg"><br><br>  The boat is equipped with the necessary baits, and you will only have to use the remote to drive it away, to the place where you think there is a fish, and then drive it back. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Advertising - accessories that may come in handy</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><ul><li>  Unscrew, fasten, touch up gear - the legendary bracelet-multitool " <a href="http://medgadgets.ru/shop/leatherman-tread-stainless-steel.html%3Futm_source%3Dgeek%26utm_medium%3Dfishing%26utm_campaign%3Dleatherman">Leatherman</a> ". </li><li>  Given the fact that fishing usually takes place in places remote from the mains, you can choose <a href="http://medgadgets.ru/shop/katalog/vneshnie-akkumuljatory.html%3Fstock%3D1%26utm_source%3Dgeek%26utm_medium%3Dfishing%26utm_campaign%3Dpowerbank">an external battery</a> . </li></ul><br></div></div><br>  Own cozy pier called <a href="http://www.designboom.com/project/corian-fishing-dock/">Corian</a> , this is a concept for those who live on the river bank.  Such a device, you can probably assemble yourself. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/9a1/48f/033/9a148f0339f64a2db2fe29e503f90f2f.jpg"></div><br>  The main convenience is in the back.  And also, when the fisherman sits on this chair, a light bulb lights up in the underwater part, the light of which attracts the fish. <br><br>  Where are without smart fishing rods.  Last year they even <a href="https://geektimes.ru/post/269274/">wrote</a> about one of them on GeekTimes, however, the fate of the project being described is foggy. <br><br>  The SmartRod developers were among the first to offer a smart bait.  By the way, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/SMARTROD-Spinning-Combo-Alert-Braided/dp/B01BY7JOHW/">only 54</a> dollars.  The main task of such a fishing rod is to pinpoint the bite, excluding ‚Äúfalse‚Äù flinches, for which the rod is equipped with several sensitive sensors. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/afe/837/9ab/afe8379ab02b44b5935fa4b88976c56f.jpg"><br>  And, in the final, a special infrared thermometer that does not scare the fish.  He was <a href="http://www.williamjoseph.net/gear.php%3FuserChoice%3DInfrared-Thermometer">introduced</a> by William Joseph. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/bc5/4da/cba/bc54dacbac104e4fb5451b18e47ee448.jpg"><br><br>  The gadget must be brought to the surface of the water, and it will instantly show the temperature.  Why you can not use any other infrared thermometer, the company does not specify. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/403889/">https://habr.com/ru/post/403889/</a></p>
