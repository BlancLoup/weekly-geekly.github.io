      AV: Yes, Secured 3D is one of the brands and one of the products that we currently sell, and it is mainly due to the fact that it is the protection of intellectual property for large enterprises for 3D printing.  And also we have a second brand, the OS 3D printer is an open system for 3D printers.  In principle, this is a similar product, but only there is not so strong security. <br><br>  <b>F .: - Tell me, how did the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãfounding the company actually come up?</b>  <b>And we are really interested: what is your company, who is it, who are these people.</b> <br><br>  AV: ‚ÄúThe idea came when we developed one medical device for a biotechnology firm and we realized that it‚Äôs difficult to get some components, i.e.  They need to be collected around the world, they may not be suitable.  And we began to use 3D printers in order to print our components, but soon we realized that a rather serious thing was the intellectual property that goes to the 3D printer.  Because at the time of Paper Age - as they say, i.e.  during the papers, a few years ago, people say, if someone copies a patent or a drawing, it took up to 3 years to reproduce this product on the market.  Further, 10 years ago, when Digital Age was still, there were CAD-designs, but CAD-designs were used mainly to measure, compare, simulate something, etc ... Accordingly, in order to move from CAD-design into a real product It took 6 months.  Those.  set up a plant, train people, etc.  Now, in the era of 3D printing, 2 days are enough from design to real product.  Let's say if someone steals STL files or someone sells a G-code file, he can launch a product before the company that invented it.  Ie quite a serious thing. <br><br>  <b>F .: - Tell me about your team, as far as I know, you have an international team, many guys work in different countries, tell about them what they are doing.</b> <br><br>  AV: - So, we have a team scattered around the world.  The main office is in California, the development and official office is in Estonia, and we also have a development office in Kiev. <br><br>  <b>F .: - Great!</b>  <b>I understand that you have a good experience in printing on 3D printers.</b>  <b>When you first became interested, in fact, a 3D printer, 3D printing and what it was.</b>  <b>Your very first printed thing.</b> <br><br>  AV: - Two years ago, we printed these mounts for the motor, mounts for cameras for a medical device, which makes an analysis and diagnoses for skin diseases.  For this we used. <br><br>  <b>F .: - Thank you.</b>  <b>Anton, tell me about the secured 3D target markets.</b> <br><br>  AV: - Basically, these are large enterprises that print important things.  They can prototype, can actually make products, and so on. Ie, this is basically the market that is in 3D. <br><br>  <b>F .: - And you can tell us about some of the applications that Secured 3D offers.</b> <br><br>  AV: - Yes, of course.  I login to the system.  Further, the first thing I see is a list of my files, i.e.  these can be CAD files, STL files, this can be G-code, I can see the file rendering, i.e.  see how this or that STL looks like.  Then I can use various applications.  For example, send it off, run through NetFab, through 3D MTP, 3D Viewer.  We also have a fairly long list of those who want to integrate with us and we select the most popular applications.  Ie as an android - any manufacturer of CAD-software can be integrated into our operating system and, in principle, in the future, we plan to take money for a single use.  10 euro cents or even less, or a little more.  This is quite profitable, in the sense that at the moment people have to buy licenses for all these programs.  They start at 100 euros and above, and sometimes in thousands.  And as a matter of fact, in order to print one file qualitatively, it is not necessary to buy all these licenses, it will suffice to select individually and use a specific application applicable to CAD programs. <br><br>  <b>F .: - Excellent, Anton, thank you.</b>  <b>Can you show us how your system works?</b> <br><br>  AV: - Yes, of course.  To facilitate the entire process, we use Workflow.  Ie, if we say in android - all applications are launched individually and individually, then in our case, you can build in chains and run files on these chains automatically.  Ie, for example, at the moment we are compiling a new Factoryflow for printing in one click from a CAD file directly.  At the moment, in any other applications, this is not particularly possible.  So the first thing I do is - I throw an app on Prehaeted, which will heat up my printer at that moment while everything slips, talks.  Then I throw the file type - CAD;  then I convert from CAD to STL - for this, too, there is a separate application.  Next, I need to fix the mathematical model of the STL file with NetFab, I throw the NetFab applet, then I physically correct the model - 3D MTP, I think many people know this service, and then I throw the slicer and select the printer I want to print from the list.  Those.  roughly speaking, by setting up 3D Factoryflow, it will be very easy to print.  The only thing left for me is to select a CAD file from my files and click ‚ÄúPrint‚Äù.  And the printing will start with the standard settings, if I want to change the settings in more detail, say, the slicer, I can click on the gear icon on the slicer and choose more detailed settings of the slicer, say, do a better print, etc.  And in principle, in the future we are planning to share Workflow with friends, i.e.  a friend or acquaintance who does not know what the files for printing are made of, he will just be able to upload the CAD file, click on ‚ÄúPrint‚Äù and it will be printed on the printer. <br><br>  <b>F .: - Thank you!</b>  <b>I think that professionals and those who are engaged in 3D printing, will be interested.</b>  <b>Please, tell me, Anton, do you now have priority in working with certain countries and where are you already working?</b> <br><br>  AV: - And we also strive for the Russian market.  Because it is quite interesting, a lot of new interesting products are released, and 3D printing is used very purposefully. <br><br>  <b>F .: - Anton, in this regard, we have the following question.</b>  <b>Entering the Russian market, which is quite voluminous, you could list the advantages of Secured 3D compared to other existing systems or tools that already exist in Russia.</b>  <b>So what, you will differ significantly?</b> <br><br>  AV: - I would say that not only in Russia, but in the world there are not so many, say, competing applications for operating systems.  Those.  for now, our competitor is Autodesk.  They also announced an open operating system called Spark, but at the moment they did not show anything at all.  Not even a single screenshot, nothing.  Although they have been talking about this for half a year already.  We are real business, everything really works for us, and people really use it for us. </div></div><br><br>  This was the first part of an interview with Anton Wedeshin.  Exactly a week later, we invite you to the second part of the interview. <br>  Especially for 3D printer shop <br><br> <a href="http://www.fabbers.ru/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/75d/4b9/896/75d4b98969de4df6ae22e6e89bb150aa.png"></a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/362467/">https://habr.com/ru/post/362467/</a></p>
