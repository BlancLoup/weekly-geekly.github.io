According to the forecast of analytical agencies, by 2018 its share in global traffic will be about 65%.  Whether it‚Äôs a YouTube clip, a Netflix TV series, or a social media video, the video is one of the most attractive types of content for users. <br><br>  The popularity and attractiveness of the video for the user can be used to increase the number of downloads of your application - this is an excellent strategy, which often gives a very good result.  Let's see how it works. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h3>  The role of the video in promoting the application </h3><br>  In a recent study by Adcolony, 100 developers took part.  Study participants know exactly how to make good applications - each of them (both the company and an individual) is the author of at least one application with 500,000 paid downloads per month.

      And almost all of them used video to attract users, preferring this particular way of promotion.  After the video, according to respondents, there are already other paid and free ways of promotion, such as advertising on Facebook or the media. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/474/c93/65c/474c9365cb974055d4856a7d3fd0fd30.png"><br>  <i>Video comes first</i> <br><br>  The same <a href="http://www.adcolony.com/blog/2015/05/11/top-publishers-reveal-latest-user-acquisition-strategy-trends/">study</a> says that video as a tool to attract users this year is 2.3 times more popular than advertising on social networks, and 23 times more popular than regular banners. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/aee/003/3e3/aee0033e369870b14cf5823d4d359285.png"><br><br>  The video can also be used as a tool for App Store Optimization (ASO) (we <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/appodeal/blog/265657/">already talked</a> about this in the <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/appodeal/blog/265657/">Appodeal blog</a> with our friends from SplitMetrics).  Both the AppStore and Google Play allow publishers to download a video pre-application.  Such videos help users understand the essence of the application and its advantages over analogues.  Downloading a promotional video allows you to go up a little higher in search than applications without a video (of course, this does not always happen, but quite often).  At the same time, a well-chosen video thumbnail / thumbnail along with screenshots allows you to increase the conversion level.  If the video is not too attractive and does not detract from the first seconds, the user simply skips the page of the application and will search further. <br><br>  The video can be viral support for your program.  For example, one of the most successful mobile games of all time, Clash of Clans, was advertised with a movie with actor Liam Neeson during the Super Bowl 2015 broadcasts. Of course, this is not a cheap pleasure, but it was worth it.  53 million video views, hundreds of thousands of downloads of the application, hundreds of thousands of active players - the creators of Clash of Clans clearly know what to do to promote. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/63b/cbb/7d8/63bcbb7d805505f539f9bd833871812b.png" alt="Clash Of Clans App Preview Video" height="561" width="718"><br><br><h3>  Types of demo videos for applications </h3><br>  It has already been mentioned that videos created to promote an application should attract the user's attention from the very first second.  Here are the most effective formats for this video: <br><br><h4>  Preview for the application (iOS) </h4><br>  Such a video can be an effective tool that increases the number of downloads.  Apple's guide limits the length of the video to half a minute.  It is necessary to take into account the fact that the iOS App Preview Video can not be localized for different countries.  Therefore, if the application is universal and it can be used by residents of many countries, you should not create voice voice acting - in the same China no one will understand anything if the voice acting is in Spanish.  We recommend that you familiarize yourself with <a href="https://developer.apple.com/app-store/app-previews/">the Apple executives</a> before starting to create the video. <br><br><iframe src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://player.vimeo.com/video/111654316&amp;xid=17259,15700023,15700186,15700191,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhhb814I5Qm8NIuPInbvoZca9dOOLg" width="177" height="315" frameborder="0" title="RetailMeNot iPhone App Preview" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><h4>  Packshot </h4><br>  Paxthot in a general sense is a still or dynamic image of the advertised product.  In commercials, they may be a close-up of the product being promoted and / or elements of the company's corporate identity (often a slogan).  Packshots might look like this: <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/cer6Hz6ehYU%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700023,15700186,15700191,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhg3JBTw7jDiTdRs8sb--cpwVBXVpg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><h4>  Animated videos </h4><br>  Cartoons - a good way to make friends with the user, because this kind of videos look immediate, friendly, attractive.  In general, this is quite a good move, and we recommend using it sometimes. <br><br><iframe src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://player.vimeo.com/video/81484155&amp;xid=17259,15700023,15700186,15700191,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhihABotN9u8EdiESTvEPCRvy65clw" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" title="Kikolabs Thinking Time" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><h4>  Live demonstration </h4><br>  It is difficult to give the name of this kind of video, but almost all of these videos use landmarks, architectural monuments and actors that play a role, for example, a tourist.  With this video, you can very quickly show what problem or issue the application solves, why the user needs it.  The video of such a plan can be used to promote the application through various channels, including social networks, company blog, TV. <br><br><iframe src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://player.vimeo.com/video/111080451&amp;xid=17259,15700023,15700186,15700191,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhh2ki8cjfAGYJg51x4LaJfZMMeLRg" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" title="Tinder plus" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><h3>  Well, I want to make a video.  What is needed for this? </h3><br>  Regardless of what format you plan to use, creating a high-quality promotional video requires planning.  Here are four key points to consider. <br><br>  <b>1. Scenario.</b>  Even the smallest video requires careful planning.  The script will help you determine the key moments of the video, which will show the benefits of the application.  You can focus on the main functions of the application, on the problems it solves, or on the advantages of your program in relation to analogues.  Do not forget that the video should collect views, which are then converted into downloads.  Therefore, at the end of the video should be a call to action.  After you have chosen the key points for the video, you can think about the format. <br><br>  <b>2. Storyboard.</b>  Once you have decided on the type of video, you can begin storyboarding.  For example, if you create previews for an iOS application or take a packshot, you need to decide how you will interact with the application during filming and what menu items you are going to show to the user.  As for the animated or "active" video (live demonstration), here you should think about the concept video in advance, and frame by frame.  Remember that the duration of the video should not exceed 2 minutes (30 seconds in the case of a video preview).  If the video is longer, you risk losing viewers.  Naturally, you need to choose the right soundtrack. <br><br>  <b>3. Record video.</b>  Depending on the format and budget, you need to decide whether to create a video yourself, or better to entrust this work to a professional.  Keep in mind that professional work does not always mean achieving your goals.  Remember that it is important for the user to figure out what will happen in the application and get motivated to install it.  Highly artistic, high-quality and expensive video is sometimes ineffective. <br><br>  <b>4. Editing.</b>  Now it's time for the final version of the video.  If you are working on your own, you should choose, for example, iMovie (free of charge under OS X) or Windows Movie Maker to add voice, music, animation and text.  There are a lot of video editors, as well as preferences, so it‚Äôs quite difficult to advise something specific here. <br><br><h3>  And now - hello, user! </h3><br>  To get viewers who are at the same time the target audience of your application, you should choose the appropriate methods for the promotion.  This could be <a href="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/ads-for-apps/mobile-app-ads">Facebook</a> , <a href="https://support.google.com/adwords/answer/6032059%3Fhl%3Den">Adwords</a> or other promotion tools.  The video should be uploaded to your blog, posted on partner sites, on YouTube and other services. <br><br>  Once again, we remind you that before you create a video for placement in the application directory, you need to familiarize yourself with the developer‚Äôs guide. <br><br>  Well, it remains only to wish for thousands and thousands of views with subsequent downloads of the application :) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/293520/">https://habr.com/ru/post/293520/</a></p>
