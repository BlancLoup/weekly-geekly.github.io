  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Perform network tasks without logging in</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"> With the identification of another dangerous network vulnerability Heartbleed, it became extremely clear that no logins and passwords guarantee us absolute security on the Internet.  Meanwhile, to perform many common tasks on the Web, there is no need at all to register anywhere, invent nicks, passwords, and generally enter some information about yourself.  Imagine that you can easily share photos, upload videos or even chat with friends without logging in anywhere! <br><br>  Of course, there are obvious advantages in registering for a service: for example, on the same Flickr all your photo albums will be stored in one place - but this also means that anyone who has access to your account can steal all your photos at once.  In addition, in some cases, you want to save incognito, without leaving any digital traces that can lead to your real coordinates.  Anonymity on the Web has become particularly relevant due to the exacerbation of paranoia among the Russian authorities, who seriously set out to control any actions of users on the Internet, at least within the territory of the Russian Federation.  So, 10 simplest tasks. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  1. Reduce links <br><br>  Among the popular services to reduce hyperlinks, which allow you to create short and easily remembered links, especially stands out is.gd - precisely because it does not need to be registered. 
      <br>

        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>
        <script>
          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>

    <img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ab9/205/7f8/ab92057f88fb262c43a15be541ad0d03.png" alt="image"><br><br>  On this service, you can also choose the type of short link: by default you get something like <a href="http://is.gd/G2vh2k">is.gd/G2vh2k</a> with letters and numbers in different registers, but you can choose the option with a link only in lower case or even with a link in lower case easy to pronounce - and therefore remember.  For example, <a href="http://is.gd/atakun">is.gd/atakun</a> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/2f4/485/0d4/2f44850d48a90233ce022f078a95c810.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Finally, the link can also be represented as a QR code in png format, inserted into the message or, say, printed. <br>  2. Sharing files <br><br>  There are many file-sharing sites that do not require registration, but one of the best is undoubtedly File Dropper.  First of all, you can upload files up to 5 GB, which far exceeds the limit on other similar services.  Secondly, if the downloaded files are downloaded, File Dropper will not automatically delete them within 30 days after the last download.  Yes, yes, even in the free version, which does not require registration. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/0dd/cfa/058/0ddcfa05892698c856a47fe291150721.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  3. Sharing text <br><br>  Suppose you need to send someone a large text document or maybe a short message in the form of a hyperlink.  To do this, you can use the service Pastebin: just type the desired text or copy it into a special field.  As a result, you will receive a hyperlink to which anyone you send it to will be able to read this text, copy it or edit it, depending on what restrictions you set.  If you sign up, you will get a lot of additional features. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/bfa/88a/06b/bfa88a06bf51d7a42eebac30f44b5e3e.png" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/6dc/9a3/877/6dc9a38770d99f3a4b28d3605e9f40e2.png" alt="image"><br><br>  4. Share photos and make memes <br><br>  Imgur is a fairly well-known service used primarily for making Internet memes.  But it is also great for uploading photos you want to share.  Images can be downloaded both from your computer and from other sites on the Internet or even just from the clipboard.  As a result, you will receive a set of links of various types, including those that allow you to insert your picture on websites and blogs. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/271/733/3ff/2717333ff29382d7f897d33ebf05c293.png" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ebe/0db/153/ebe0db1533832a7c41921b17bd05dadd.png" alt="image"><br><br>  5. Sharing videos <br><br>  In order to upload videos to the most popular YouTube or Vimeo services, you will have to register and create an account, but there is also an alternative option.  To use Viddme, you just need to go to the site (or open a mobile application for Android or iOS) and upload your video or animated GIF.  After downloading, you can share a hyperlink, send a video to Facebook, Twitter, embed it in a blog - just like on any other video hosting service, only completely anonymous. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b48/b8f/df8/b48b8fdf8fca6197262f5481323dff9a.png" alt="image"><br><br>  6. Making video calls <br><br>  Want to make a personal or collective video call and do not want to log in to Skype or Google Hangouts?  Try Appear.in, a service that allows you to communicate without any registrations.  You simply enter, create a new room for video chat and share a link to it with your friends.  Simultaneous communication between eight subscribers is supported, so this is a very good offer for a small company. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/5b9/5be/02d/5b95be02da263a5f0fd23c6d3721058f.png" alt="image"><br><br>  7. Chatting with friends <br><br>  A similar anonymous chat service is Chatstep.  You just need to think of a unique name for the chat room, your nickname and, if you wish, a password - and now you are already in it.  Knowing the name (and, if necessary, the password), anyone can enter it. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/942/bbe/f07/942bbef07af7ad60e21180436509f78a.png" alt="image"><br><br>  The great thing is that you can view old chat rooms and even share pictures, but the creators claim that they do not store any information about chat rooms and do not use tracking scripts. <br>  8. Listen to music <br><br>  Many streaming music services like Spotify require registration even to listen to free songs, but there is an alternative option (and this is not VKontakte).  On the Grooveshark website, you can immediately start playing the found song - and in the service archive you will find many popular artists, including Russian ones.  Moreover, you can even create a playlist - but in order to save playlists and download songs, registration is required. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c62/0c2/a0f/c620c2a0f477c0d550e7940f844f3aef.png" alt="image"><br><br>  9. Convert files <br><br>  A pretty popular service is the conversion of various files from one format to another.  Most often we are talking about video, audio, digital images, archives, document files and electronic books and automated design systems.  And this is where the Zamzar website specializes, which is not only completely anonymous, but completely free, which is hard to believe, given the truly huge number of supported formats and more than 1,200 (!) Different conversion options. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c45/01d/1f4/c4501d1f42413e58437063e4333f8fdf.png" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c45/01d/1f4/c4501d1f42413e58437063e4333f8fdf.png" alt="image"><br><br>  After successful conversion, you receive a link to the file you received, sent to the email address you entered.  It will be deleted after 24 hours.  Without registration, you can convert files up to 100 MB, but registering will increase their ‚Äúweight‚Äù to gigabytes, and also get accelerated conversion and cloud storage with a capacity of up to 100 GB, depending on the tariff plan. <br>  10. We send and receive emails. <br><br>  It would seem that the e-mail service simply cannot function without registration and authorization, but this is not so.  Imagine that you need a fake temporary address to receive letters, while allowing you to remain anonymous - for example, to register on a non-trusted resource.  To do this, you can use a service called Yopmail, which is especially colorful in Russian, especially since it has a fully Russified version.  Yopmail does not require registration, you only need to remember the fake address (or accidentally suggested by the service) and check your email.  All received messages are stored for 8 days. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c57/8ed/d73/c578edd731c20310305a266e69976203.png" alt="image"><br><br>  You can send an anonymous letter from a false address through the Deadfake service, while in the sender column you can and should enter the invented address from a real-life domain, otherwise the letter will not be delivered.  Although Deadfake does not guarantee delivery of all letters, we note that everything worked for us. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/53c/75a/58f/53c75a58ffc09f00efb242dec45658bf.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Source: <a href="http://www.computerra.ru/">www.computerra.ru</a> <br><br>  For video calls and conferences, <a href="https://meet.jit.si/">meet.jit.si</a> really works only on webkit browsers for now.  You can even put it both on the server, and also an interesting feature is the p2p data transfer, so there is no limit on the number of participants. <habracut></habracut></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/220783/">https://habr.com/ru/post/220783/</a></p>
