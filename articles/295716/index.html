  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Yandex is decrepit. You can eat it</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The Kinopoisk scandal brought to the surface that Yandex would be worth guarding as the apple of his eye.  It is not surprising that all the management involved in disclosing this terrible secret was dismissed for violating the Non-Disclosure Act.  But we did not sign any act (although who knows what is included in the standard Yandex license), so we can tell what kind of terrible military secret is ... <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  With a light and hard work, the company's employees very correctly described what is called in the management ‚Äúproblems of growing up the company‚Äù.  There are various theories explaining what is happening with firms, but most management theorists agree with the presence of several stages in the company's ‚Äúlife‚Äù.  Novice entrepreneurs are engaged in business at the level of an individual entrepreneur, then attract workers, expand their staff, and so on until they have the opportunity to jump into a big business.  At this level, the techniques that helped in the previous stages do not work well, so you have to hire completely new people. <br><br>  Leap into a large business is the most dangerous for an entrepreneur.  Firstly, he risks losing control over his business for various reasons - there will be shareholders, it will be necessary to delegate some of the powers.  Secondly, a successful model may not be scalable.  It is because of this that many corporations insist on minimizing, maximizing the fragmentation of their business.  So Microsoft was originally built: Bill Gates always tried to create it as an association of small groups, each of which has sufficient autonomy;  just built McDonalds. <br><br><h4>  Formalism kills business </h4><br>  States and large corporations are confronted with a constant challenge: every minute they need to find a balance between transparency of procedures and efficiency.  Although it seems that one should support the other, in fact, between these approaches is a fundamental contradiction.  Transparency of business, primarily for managers and shareholders, means that all participants in the processes should properly record their behavior.  This can manifest itself in different ways: somewhere you have to fill in kilometers of paper, somewhere you have to write reports and applications on a daily basis, somewhere you have to go to work only with a ‚Äúpimp‚Äù.  The essence remains the same: the information must be recorded by someone in the database.  At some point, it doesn‚Äôt really matter how much this information is true, and report generation becomes completely unnoticeable for management by the main business of the corporation.

    <h4>  Signs of "decrepitude" </h4><br>  By occupation, I have to be "inside" of different companies and corporations.  And if the owners can miss something from the inside, the outside lawyer can discern the signs of the decrepitude of the company.  It is impossible to describe them with formal signs, otherwise there will be another form to fill out, and their definition will be meaningless.  It is necessary to sound the alarm when such things happen: <br>  - the company holds seminars on filling out internal documentation; <br>  - management introduces a new management system before the implementation of the previous one was completed; <br>  - in the company leaders who carry out the general management are appreciated, poorly understanding the essence of the matter; <br>  - among the staff there are conversations like: ‚Äúthis is not my area of ‚Äã‚Äãresponsibility‚Äù; <br>  - management begins to think that the threshold of entry into the market protects them from competitors, which can in extreme cases be bought up; <br>  - it becomes easier for employees to keep silent than to make a critical comment on some issue. <br>  All this is well known from the theory, practice and history of the business, and yet, thousands of giant corporations are attacking the same rake, collapsing in front of thousands of analysts and consultants. <br><br>  It seems that signs of decrepitude appeared in Yandex. <br><br>  This company climbed to the business of Olympus and began to rest on its laurels, ignoring completely objective competition in this market.  Achieved parity with Google, pushing other competitors to the side of the road are all seeming successes.  Today they are, and tomorrow - they will write about them in the books ‚ÄúGreat Victories of the Past‚Äù. <br><br>  The further the process of providing services to the user within the company is formalized, the more time will be spent on the introduction of new management techniques, the decreasing will be Yandex. <br><br><h4>  What does this mean for the rest? </h4><br>  This gives exceptional hope.  The general rule: who enters later, gets more technology and at a lower price, extends to this market.  Those who have thrown their youthful dreams of creating their own search engine should read the new items, turn their code and look at a bunch of open-source projects.  Those who want to challenge in the sale of copyright objects, you can not be afraid of the presence in this market Yandex. Music. <br><br>  Yandex decrepit.  Maybe he still has a chance to straighten his shoulders and break out, but too many people tell him that he won all.  And in the silence of the market, those who set an ambitious, arrogant and reckless goal - to devour Yandex - will surely wake up. <br><br>  They have a chance. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/295716/">https://habr.com/ru/post/295716/</a></p>
