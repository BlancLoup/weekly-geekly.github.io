Too much, he liked the authors of Soviet popular science books, who did not miss the opportunity to mention it on occasion.

Here to learn a little more. <br><br>  When an <a href="https://hackaday.com/2019/04/12/televox-the-pasts-robot-of-the-future/">article about him</a> appeared on Hackaday's blog, I decided to ... not translate it.  Since there is not much more information there, except for a couple of little-known facts: first, traveling, the developers took only the ‚Äúbox‚Äù with them, and each time they cut out a flat anthropomorphic figure in place, and secondly, the device was made on Knowles lamps close to tiratronam (as it turned out, no - the lamps are ordinary).

      The increase in the number of energy transfer systems with many small loads located close to each other made the presence of operators near each of them expensive and impractical. <br><br>  To circumvent this limitation, such dispatch control systems were invented, where switching devices located close to the loads are selectively controlled and monitored by a single operator along the signal lines from the control room.  This turned out to be more efficient than placing multiple operators next to each of the loads. <br><br>  But in order to selectively manage remote loads and monitor them, it turned out that it was necessary to develop an alarm system with characteristics adapted for dispatch control.  For this purpose, for example, it was required to choose correctly which load to control.  But at the same time switching is made infrequently.  In the initial position, the load is disconnected, and it must be ready to start at any time, either manually by the operator or automatically. <br><br>  The requirement for error-free control and monitoring of switching devices led to the development of very complex and expensive systems.  In addition, the cost of lines laid between the dispatcher‚Äôs office and the locations of the control objects is added.  For additional reliability, lines laid to the control objects distributed over the serviced territory are duplicated.  And since switching is infrequent, most of the time these lines are idle. <br><br>  But between the dispatcher‚Äôs office and the loads controlled from there, telephone lines are usually laid.  It is possible to transmit information via them, but telephone companies oppose this and do not allow exchanging other types of signals along these lines, except voice.  And the lines themselves are not very suitable for transmitting other signals.  Telephone operators' fears will no longer be justified if these signals are given characteristics close to those of speech signals.  It turned out that signals at frequencies similar to the frequencies of human speech are also suitable for telecontrol of switching devices and monitoring their condition. <br><br>  The subject matter of the invention is: <br><br><ul><li>  using telephone lines for telecontrol and television signaling in such a way as to prevent telephone companies from finding fault with the characteristics of transmitted signals </li><li>  using such signals to manage loads and monitor their condition from the central control room </li><li>  management of telephones in the locations of control objects from the same office </li><li>  use of standard telephones as subscriber devices </li><li>  selective interaction with a multitude of control objects from one control room </li></ul><br>  All of the above can be carried out separately and together in various combinations. <br><br>  In fig.  1 shows the diagrams of the device located in the dispatcher's office, as well as the receiving device at the control object, in fig.  2 - logic diagram for relays and searchers on the same object. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/gj/_3/u9/gj_3u9s3q9jo9xbrlrdxz3unk04.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/sp/um/zv/spumzv5vectklmbiwvemadt8_sm.png"><br><br>  Key 100 consists of contact groups 102, 103, 104, and 105, while group 105 is normally closed.  Conductor 106 goes to point 107, and from there to secondary winding 116 of transformer 109. Movable contact 102, closing to fixed contact 110, short-circuits the standard telephone dialer 112, connecting point 113 through conductors 114 and 106 with point 107. This will be described in more detail later .  The movable contact 103 is connected via conductor 115 to the primary winding 108 of the transformer 109. When the corresponding contact group is closed, this circuit is also connected via conductor 117 to the winding 118 of the buzzer 119 '.  Buzzer 119 contains a tuning fork, which sets the frequency of the oscillations generated by it.  The buzzers 120 ', 124' and 119 'are tuned to different frequencies, which allows you to selectively enable and disable remote switches on the control object. <br><br>  The movable contact 104 is connected by conductor 119 through the winding 120 of the buzzer 120 'and through conductor 115 to the power switch through the multi-turn winding 108 of the sound transformer 109. When the circuit of the winding of the buzzer 120' closes, a tone package is sent to the telephone line (it is described below) ) how exactly a remote switch to control on a remote object. <br><br>  The movable contact 105 is connected by conductor 121 to the key 122, and by conductor 123 (when the contacts are closed) - with the buzzer winding 124. At the same time, an audio signal is sent to the telephone line to move the selected remote switch to the desired position.  The disk dialer 112 interrupts the current in the secondary winding circuit 108 of the transformer 109, coming to a standard sound emitter located near the microphone 126 of a standard telephone set 127. The device consists of a microphone 126 and a sound emitter 129, connected in the usual way via call 130 to a telephone line (conductors 131, 132 ), and then with the telephone station. <br><br>  Telephone exchange, schematically depicted as pos.  133 is standard, a lot of lines come to it, and any two of them can be connected in such a way as to provide communication between the calling and called subscribers. <br><br>  A line of conductors 134, 135 is drawn from the telephone exchange to the facility, where remote switches are located that require control and monitoring.  The line is connected to the same telephone set, consisting of ring 136, sound emitter 138 and microphone 139. Ring 136, consisting of winding 140 and movable part 141, responds to the call signal from the telephone station intermittently connects plus the power source to wire 142, connected to the winding of the relay 143 with the release delay.  In the initial state, the normally closed contact group 145 of this relay is connected, plus the power supply, to the winding of the relay 144, also with a release delay.  The winding of the relay 144 is controlled not only by the contact group 145, but also by the contact group 281 through the conductor 146 to reset the device to its initial position in the manner described below. <br><br>  Relay 144, by its contact group 145 ', controls the circuit for transferring the device to the on state from the initial position in the manner described below.  Contact group 145 'is connected by conductor 146' to the relay coil 147, in which there is no voltage in the initial position, but appears when releasing relay 144 when a call comes in from a telephone exchange, in the manner described below. <br><br>  The relay 147, when triggered, switches on the solenoid 148, lifting the handset 138, which is why the same switchings occur in the telephone set as when a person picks up the handset.  Also, when this relay is activated, power is supplied to the lamps described below.  At the time of removal of the handset, the connection of the dispatcher‚Äôs office is established through telephone lines, devices and a station with a remote object in the manner described below.  The emitter 138 acts on the carbon microphone 149, controlling the flow of current through the conductor 150 in accordance with the shape of the sound vibrations. <br><br>  Conductor 150 is connected in series with the primary winding 152 of the transformer 151, and then through conductor 154 with the battery 155, and through ne1 with the conductor 156. <br><br>  The secondary winding 153 of the same transformer is connected to the grid of the lamp 157. This lamp consists of a cathode, a grid and an anode, and is switched on in the usual way used to amplify audio signals (not quite common - no DC isolation and bias - translator).  The anode of the lamp is connected by conductor 158 to the primary winding 159 of the sound transformer 164, then through it to conductor 160, battery 161, conductor 162 and the thread of the same lamp.  The secondary winding 163 of the transformer 164 is connected to the grid of the lamp 165, similar to the lamp 157. Such a two-stage amplifier is known and is not the subject of the invention. <br><br>  The lamp 165 controls the primary winding of the sonic transformer 167. Its secondary windings 168, 169 and 170 are connected to circuits consisting of capacitors 168, 169 and 170 and inductors 172, 174 and 176 '.  The circuits are tuned to the same frequencies as the buzzers 120 ', 124' and 119 'in the control room. <br><br>  The grid of the lamp 176 is connected by conductor 177 to the circuit, which includes the inductor 172. The anode of the same lamp is connected by conductor 178 to the primary winding 179 of the sound transformer 180, then by conductor 181 to the battery 161 connected to the filament of the same lamp.  The grids of lamps 182 and 187 are similarly connected to circuits, which include inductors 174 and 176 ', and their anode circuits control the primary windings 185 and 189 of sound transformers 186 and 190. <br><br>  The signals from the secondary windings of transformers 180, 186 and 190 are amplified by lamps 191, 194 and 197 in the same way.  But they have a negative bias from small batteries, so without a signal, the current through their anode circuit does not leak.  When a signal arrives at the grid of one of the lamps, it turns on the relay coil, respectively, 192, 195 or 198. <br><br>  Go to pic.  2, the two-winding remote switches 200, 201, and 203 are shown here, although there may be more of them, along with the rest of the nodes controlling them.  The step finders 204-207, each of which consists of a moving contact and a set of stationary, are controlled by a winding 208. They determine which signals will be fed back to the controller, informing him of the current status of the remote switches in the manner described below. <br><br>  Winding 208 through conductor 209 is connected to a normally closed contact group 233, controlled in the manner described below, to change the positions of stepper finders 204-207. A delayed relay 210 is connected so that the voltage on its winding appears and disappears synchronously with the voltage on the winding 208 The interaction of these relays leads to the fact that pulses arrive at the winding 208, and the step finders switch, selecting different signal sources for transmitting data about their state to the dispatcher.  Relay 211 is intermediate between relay 210 and winding 208 stepper finders. <br><br>  The switch-on circuit of the relay 212 is controlled by the contacts of the searcher 205, selecting a device, the state of which is sent to the controller in the manner described below.  Relay 213 in the initial state is turned on, and together with relay 212 controls the supply of a coded signal to the moving contacts of the searchers 204-207 so that the code of either the selected remote object or the load is transmitted.  The buzzer 214 switches the bell transformer 215, consisting of the primary winding 216 and the secondary winding 217 to receive a sound signal, which is interrupted in accordance with the object code and the selected load. <br><br>  The second set of searchers 218 - 221 is selectively controlled according to the code combination of pulses coming from the control room to select a remote switch, which will be controlled in the manner described below.  The moving contacts of these searchers are controlled by the winding 222, which, in turn, is controlled by the contact group 191 of the relay 191 'in the manner described below. <br><br>  Relays 223 and 224 are common to all remote switches, and when the movable contact of the finder 218 moves from one fixed contact to another, one of these relays is triggered depending on whether that remote switch is turned on or off to which status contacts is connected at this moment. moving contact of this finder.  Relays 225 and 226 are also common to all remote switches, and they are controlled by the final control pulse from the control room to close the circuits through which current passes through the contacts of relay 223 or 224, depending on which of them is currently on . <br><br>  A relay 227 controls a winding 222 switching step finders.  Also the same winding controls a group of normally closed contacts.  When an object is selected, a buzzer is generated, activated via the contact group of relay 227, in the manner described below.  The moving contacts of the searchers move until they return to their original position.  Relays 228 - 230 are turned on in the manner described below, after selecting a remote object, and return the device to its original position with a certain delay.  Thus, if the operator at the telephone station accidentally connects someone else besides the dispatcher with the remote object, the device will soon return to its original position automatically. <br><br>  So, the connection is established, the remote switch, the state of which you want to change, is selected.  What happens next? <br><br>  Suppose the dispatcher decided to turn on the remote switch 203 shown in the diagram in the disabled state.  First, he asks the operator at the telephone exchange to connect it with the corresponding object, and he connects it. <br><br>  Call 140 starts ringing, contact group 141-142 closes, voltage is applied to the relay coil 143. <br><br>  When the voltage is removed from this winding, relay 144 is turned on through the normally closed contact group 145, which changes the state of its contact groups 14, 145 'and 15. Group 15 and conductor 231 prepare the winding activation circuit of the stepping searchers 222, but the current does not pass yet, because the group is open 232 relay 227. <br><br>  In the initial position, the power supply circuit of the relay 213 and 227 is closed along conductor 233, the first fixed contact of the finder 218 and its moving contact to the minus of the battery. <br><br>  About the operation of the relay 143 in the manner described above, the relay 144 is turned off, the contact group 145 is opened.  After a while, group 14 of relay 144 closes, and relay 143 self-locks: plus the battery is connected through group 14, then group 15 ', to the winding of relay 143, the opposite terminal of which is connected to negative.  Relay 143 remains on until a trip signal is received in the manner described below. <br><br>  A further result of the disconnection of the relay 144 is the opening of the winding circuit of the stepper finders 222 prepared through group 15, as well as the closing of the circuit for switching on the relay 147 through group 145 '. <br><br>  Plus the battery is connected through a group of 145 'and a conductor 232' with the buzzer winding 214, then with the battery minus.  This circuit is described in more detail below. <br><br>  The relay 147 is triggered by the raising of the tube by a solenoid 148 controlled by group 16. <br><br>  The microphone 149 begins to receive sounds as soon as the receiver with the sound emitter 138 is picked up, which is why the current in the conductor 150 varies in accordance with the sound vibrations coming from this sound emitter. <br><br>  Together with the turn-on circuit of the relay 147, the winding circuit of the searchers 208 through the conductor 209, group 233, conductor 233 'and group 145' closes.  The moving contacts of the searchers 204-207 are prepared for the transition to the next position.  The switching circuit of the relay 211 through group 235, conductor 234, conductor 232 'and group 145' closes. <br><br>  Relay 211 turns on relay 210. Group 233 opens the power supply circuit of the winding of the searchers 208, and the step finders switch to the second position.  The delayed release relay 210 switches off after the relay 211 is turned off, and after a while its contacts open.  Group 233 closes, winding 208 is energized, and searchers are again prepared for switching. <br><br>  Thus, the alternate actuation of the winding of the searchers 208 and the relay with a release delay 210 causes the movable contacts of the searchers to move along different fixed contacts. <br><br>  When the searcher 204 goes into tripled position, the power supply circuit of the winding 208 is prepared through the searcher 204 along with the circuit passing through group 145 ', and the winding starts to turn on periodically regardless of the state of the relay 144 immediately after the searcher switches to the second position (because all the fixed contacts of the searcher 204, except the first, are connected together). <br><br>  So, seekers are starting to switch.  Recall that switching off relay 144 and closing group 145 'closes the buzzer circuit 214. When the buzzer vibrates, pulses are applied to the primary winding 216 of the bell transformer 215 with the frequency to which the buzzer is tuned.  Circuit closes: battery minus, group 237, buzzer winding 214 primary winding 216, conductor 232, group 145 ', plus batteries. <br><br>  When an intermittent current passes through the primary winding 216 of the transformer 215, an alternating voltage is applied to the winding 217 to the sound source 199 through the following circuit: conductor 214, winding 217, group 242, finder 207 in the third position, conductor 243, second output of the sound emitter 199. In addition the third position of the seeker, the same circuit closes when it is in the fifth, seventh, ninth and tenth positions.  Thus, the dispatcher receives five tone parcels, while the fourth and fifth parcels almost merge into one long one.  On another remote object, the fixed contacts of the same searcher are connected differently so that the dispatcher will receive a different code. <br><br>  The frequency of setting the buzzer 214 is in the range of human speech, which should not cause any complaints among operators.  The dispatcher listens to the code and determines whether it was correctly connected to the remote object that he needs. <br><br>  Making sure that everything is correct, the dispatcher presses the key, the group 104 closes, the winding 120 of the buzzer 120 'is energized.  The sound signal arrives at the primary winding 108 of the sound transformer 109. From the secondary winding 116, the signal arrives at the sound emitter 125 through a dial pad 112. On it, the dispatcher dials the number 5, and the same tone tones are received.  They are ‚Äúheard‚Äù by the microphone 126, and the corresponding signals are sent to the telephone station via lines 131, 132. <br><br>  At a distant object, the emitter 138 emits these sounds into the microphone 149, causing the current through the conductor 150 to change accordingly.  It enters the primary winding 152 of the sound transformer 151 through the following circuit: microphone, primary winding, conductor 154, battery 155, conductor 156, group 30 of relay 147, activated as described above, and conductor 31. The signal is amplified by a lamp 157, supplied through a transformer 164 to the lamp 165, and after amplification to the winding 166 of the transformer 167. Since the oscillation frequency of the buzzer 120 'corresponds to the tuning frequency of the circuit 168, 171, the signal from it goes to the lamp 176, is amplified by it and supplied to the primary winding 179 of the transformer 180. The lamp 191 reinforces and in  straightens the signal, causing switch 191 'is activated. <br><br>  The winding 222 of the searchers 218-221 along the following circuit is turned on: battery plus, group 192, conductor 250, winding 222, minus the battery.  Searchers are prepared to switch to the next position.  When the contacts of the dialer 112 open for the first time, the relay 191 is turned off, the voltage is removed from the winding 222, and the searchers switch. <br><br>  The searcher 218 in the second position disconnects the relays 227 and 213. Relay 227 prepares the turn-on circuit for the windings of the searchers through group 232, but it is not yet closed, because relay 144 has not worked. <br><br>  Releasing the relay 213 causes the circuit to open through the searcher 207, through which the signal about the code of the selected remote object passes, as group 242 switches. The circuit is prepared through the searcher 206 to signal the selection of the remote switch in the manner described below. <br><br>  By the time the dispatcher sends five pulses by the dialer, relay 191 'is turned on and off five times.  The same happens with the winding 222 seekers 218-221. <br><br>  When the searchers reach the fifth position, the power supply of the relay 224 closes, since the remote switch 203 is in the off position.  The circuit is closed from the battery, winding relay 224, conductor 251, contact status 203 'remote switch 203, conductor 252', finder 218 in the fifth position and the battery minus. <br><br>  When the relay 224 is turned on, the switch-on circuit of the relay 226 is prepared through group 252, but this circuit is not yet closed, since group 41 of relay 195 is open. The signaling circuit of the state of the remote switch is closed through group 253.
