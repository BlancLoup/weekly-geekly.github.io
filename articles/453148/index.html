I want to describe the situation that happened to me and the AirBnb service a couple of days ago. <br><br>  Briefly: I made one successful reservation from my account and tried to make another 3 without any confirmation from my side, then they untied the phone number and deleted my account without any confirmation.  And how without an account to contact AirBnb is absolutely impossible. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f9a/f2f/b86/f9af2fb864d338763b25a46ec254ce2d.png" alt="image"></div><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  I have been using the AirBnb service for quite some time (since 2015).  During this time, I used it many times in different places: mainly Europe and a little Australia and Russia.  Also during this time I earned a good reputation based on the feedback from people from whom I lived.

      I log into the AirBnb account through Google.  To be honest, I don‚Äôt remember if I have a login using a password, but most likely no. <br><br>  On May 22, 2019 at about 8:18 pm (Moscow time) I received an e-mail that I had successfully reserved an apartment in Bucharest, Romania.  Although I did not do this!  Reservation code: HMAB4W8NBN.  Receipt ID: RC29QSES9Q.  Payment was successful (1 night, approximately 130 euros).  Payment went from one of my debit cards (I have two of them attached). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/cf7/e64/182/cf7e64182c6d102ed1fb3eeb1d0a7c35.png" alt="image"><br><br>  the confirmation <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/10a/5bd/f76/10a5bdf76940fb8146aa57e547e7c8b7.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Then I received 3 more emails that tried to pay for 3 more apartments, but from another card, without success (since I didn‚Äôt have money on that card). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/dd2/cb6/35b/dd2cb635b88cd3376b84fd21645a55a8.png" alt="image"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/1c1/982/153/1c19821536e310b8635c6d8d01b38c48.png" alt="image"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/bad/69d/7df/bad69d7df2a0da51284de4a2a88fb2dd.png" alt="image"><br><br>  I did not receive any confirmation via SMS or email to confirm the purchase.  No SMS from the bank (Raiffeisen).  Later I called the bank and I was told that SMS confirmation of purchases is not required from everyone, that is, from the bank‚Äôs point of view, this is the norm.  Although as for me it is tin. <br><br>  After another couple of minutes, I received 4 identical emails with the following content: <br><blockquote>  Your Airbnb account was canceled <br><br>  When you cancel your account, your account will no longer appear on the site.  Guest will automatically be canceled.  You can contact us with a canceled account. </blockquote><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/edd/53e/2a6/edd53e2a6228d6d1a28a18c213091d51.png" alt="image"><br><br>  I found this whole thing only a couple of hours after the commission, as there was no access to the mail.  After detection, I tried to log in to my account (via google), but AirBnb wrote to me ‚ÄúNo account exists for that Google login.  Try signing up instead. ‚Äù.  An attempt to reset the password produced the same error. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/dff/d0c/d66/dffd0cd66be2e47caf6d153f327efacf.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Then I climbed to look at the support information (email or phone).  There is no e-mail on the AirBnb website at all!  I found only one terms@airbnb.com.  I wrote my own situation on it, but I don‚Äôt really think that something will come back to me. <br><br>  I also found a telephone support service for different countries.  I called in several countries (Russia, USA).  Everywhere there is an answering machine, which asks to enter a phone number that is affixed to an account.  I enter it, but it tells me that an account with such a phone was not found.  I tried to enter the number several times, in different ways (+ 7 ..., 8 ..., without 8, etc.) - the same answer. <br><br>  In general, in this situation, I absolutely do not understand what to do.  Go directly to the court unless.  In general, if someone knows how to reach the AirBnb in such a situation - please help. <br><br>  <b>UPDATE:</b> <br><br>  It turns out that people like me are not small: <a href="https://twitter.com/search%3Fq%3Dairbnbhelp%26src%3Dtypd">twitter.com/search?q=airbnbhelp&amp;src=typd</a> <br><br>  There are also some tips here: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AirBnB/comments/bs1r0f/violation_on_airbnb_somebody_logged_in_my_account/">www.reddit.com/r/AirBnB/comments/bs1r0f/violation_on_airbnb_somebody_logged_in_my_account</a> <br><br>  <b>UPDATE UPDATE:</b> <br><br>  Described the situation on twitter @airbnbhelp in direct.  They responded in a few hours, immediately sent an email link to change the password and activate the account.  All fraudulent reservations have been canceled and are now in the process of a refund.  True, I blocked the card, but went to the bank and there they promise to settle everything.  In AirBnb, they said that the money will not even be returned by a blocked card, so it is possible that there will be no problems from blocking.  So there are no claims on AirBnb in this account, everything is operational. <br><br>  But the fact remains that in order to understand where to write I had to concoct an article in reddit.  Why they cannot write in their help that if they write to tweeter is not clear.  It is also not clear why they do not have (did not work) two-factor authentication (or don't I know about it?). </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/453148/">https://habr.com/ru/post/453148/</a></p>
