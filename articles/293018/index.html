Will all this make sense for self-driving cars? <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/e74/7f9/129/e747f9129c9f4cb61db0e31f2e7ae40a.jpg" alt="Will all this make sense for self-driving cars?"><br><br>  There is no doubt that changes are already looming on the horizon that will significantly change our cities.  Everything that we see today on our streets is intended to please the man-driver.  But what will the streets look like if we redo them to please the driver computer?  Please note that the list below will take effect only when people lose access to control on the roads, and autonomous machines will be connected to each other and connected to the Internet. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  Street signs </h2><br>  ‚ÄúStop‚Äù, ‚Äúmake way‚Äù, ‚Äúspeed limit‚Äù - all these and other signs will be a thing of the past.  Street signs direct our attention and urge us to take action: slow down, succumb, or more carefully enter a sharp turn.  As soon as the cars are ‚Äúupdated‚Äù - probably through Google Maps - they will automatically adhere to all restrictions and slow down near schools.

    <h2>  Traffic lights </h2><br>  Red, yellow, green.  Soon we will not see these pillars of our intersections anywhere.  What will we have traffic lights for?  Algorithms will calculate the best way to cope with traffic, and cars will obediently stop and go.  Now it seems crazy, but it will become our reality in the near future. <br><br><h2>  Traffic lanes </h2><br>  Lines of demarcation help you understand when to or should not be rebuilt.  Self-guided cars will understand this without lanes, because they will have information about the width of the road and the distance to neighboring cars.  There will be much more cars in our streets, and this will probably be a frightening sight. <br><br><h2>  Turn signals and brake lights </h2><br>  From the day of their invention, cars are developed in the calculation of human control.  The stop and turn signals are intended to inform other drivers of your intention to turn or brake.  If we are talking about the interaction of computers, then now they do not need light, they just need to send each other a few bits of code.  Do you think this is crazy?  That's not all! <br><br><h2>  Taxi </h2><br>  Judging by the hunt with which the generation of the Millenium <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259F%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BA%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B5_Y"><sup>‚òÖ</sup></a> chooses to use car sharing instead of buying its own, the importance of owning a car of its own will rapidly decrease.  Thus, the icons "taxi" on the roofs of cars soon disappear completely.  Shared, shared cars will not stand out in the general stream of cars. <br><br><h2>  Parking hours </h2><br>  Due to the fact that people will no longer own cars, there will be no need to leave the car in the parking lot, go about their business while it stands idle, and then return to it.  In the future, the car will drop you off, and leave to look for the next closest customer to pick up, and you don‚Äôt need to worry about parking.  And if we think about this idea thoroughly, we will understand that parking spaces will also decrease in size, because the machines will be able to insert incredibly close to each other.  And there they will recharge their batteries. <br><br><h2>  Gas stations </h2><br>  Filling stations will definitely change their current look.  But I want to point out that the cars will be recharged automatically, being parked at home or in the parking lot, after they have long and diligently transported customers around the district. <br><br><h2>  Bonus: Traffic </h2><br>  And here is the cherry on the cake: you will get to your destination much faster!  Moreover, inside the car will be much more space.  Places to sleep, exercise, work, take time to create or any other dictates of your heart.  This is your personal space, just like this room you are in now.  ‚àé </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/293018/">https://habr.com/ru/post/293018/</a></p>
