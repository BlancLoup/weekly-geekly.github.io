It is somehow quieter to be in the city, if at any moment you can make sure that the pipes in the house are not frozen, and the toilet is not lying on the floor with a pile of debris.  I diligently invented a variety of telemetry systems, realizing them, as a rule, from what was at hand - for example, an old laptop with an external USB thermometer, the log from which is written to Dropbox. <br><br>  Since the mobile Internet (WiFi via a router with an LTE modem) is in the house, this system works pretty well - until the first serious power outage, which also, alas, happens.  Unfortunately, such a scheme cannot repair itself after a blackout.  Slightly more effective was the system even more primitive - a smartphone on an android, aimed by a camera at a normal household thermometer. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/447/d3c/e6a/447d3ce6afb3466cb4a736bb3aff2caa.jpg" height="550">

      A utility is installed on it, which, upon the arrival of an SMS with a command, takes a picture and puts it on the same Dropbox.  Since a smartphone can last without external power for a couple of days and does not require additional Internet, doing its own, the system is more reliable, but, nevertheless, you will agree, somehow technically ugly.  And finally, thanks to the company Dadzhet, I got into the hands of a device that was designed to solve exactly my problem - the GSM socket Senseit GS2 M. <br><br>  The device solves two problems - temperature control with data transmission and remote control of the load.  The second will seem more important to someone - it is convenient to turn something on and off on command, this immediately sees a bunch of applications - heating, cooling, starting irrigation ... But are there few actuators included in the network?  But for me, first of all, the first function is important - remote control.  Since the main source of heat in the house is a wood stove, it will not be possible to launch it on command.  But seeing that the temperature inside the house is approaching a critical one, I can come and heat the room.  This is not very technological, but it just happened. <br><br>  The socket is made by Senseit, which I have reason to respect - I have not lived their phone in my pocket for years. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d3a/eeb/21d/d3aeeb21dd6041efa94b8f6270ed9f67.jpg"><br><br>  Over the years of tough use, he proved to be an extremely reliable and well-made device, so I have high ‚Äúloyalty to the brand‚Äù. <br>  The socket is equipped with an external temperature sensor: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/9fe/960/4a7/9fe9604a7441421fac9160414b6e623f.jpg"><br><br>  It is connected with a standard 3.5 mm audio plug, which allows the use of standard extension cords: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/870/365/e73/870365e7361a48af8f112d6b18e2f198.jpg"><br><br>  This greatly expands the applicability of the device.  The fact is that it should be located where there is a steady reception of a GSM signal, and in a country house it is often not every point of the internal space. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/69e/090/9be/69e0909be22f4a2a9b6a8e6abd132760.jpg"><br><br>  It is likely that the point where you get the desired signal does not coincide with the one where you would like to control the temperature.  For example, the best reception will be on the window, but the cold from the glasses will lead to an underestimation of the sensor. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/61a/423/4bd/61a4234bd7c1438c826fcce6b23542e6.jpg"><br><br>  This is where the opportunity to take the sensor from the device comes in handy.  Experiments have shown that an extension cord of reasonable length has almost no effect on the thermocouple readings. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/722/d51/884/722d518848084476af820023c7e5eefe.jpg"><br><br>  On the right side of the outlet are located from left to right: <br>  1. connector for temperature sensor <br>  2. SET key - to reset slave connections <br>  3. Key M - for manual on / off load <br>  4. Plug of the technological connector (it has a mini-USB form factor, but it is useless to connect to a computer, you probably need a special programmer) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/56b/5f4/f56/56b5f4f56a654e79b5cf1ab7aadffcc2.jpg"><br><br>  Clause 2 requires further clarification.  The fact is that the Senseit GS2 M is a master socket to which up to ten complementary slave devices can be connected.  They are very similar in appearance, but do not have a GSM module, communicating only with the head unit over a local radio channel at a frequency of 433Mhz.  I do not have them, because, I repeat, mankind has not yet invented a gadget that would drive them to the barn for firewood and melt the stove.  But I do not lose hope - perhaps it will appear before Gazprom revises its tariffs for connecting gas in rural areas. <br><br>  Yes, GSM module.  In the back of the outlet there is a lid where the SIM card is inserted: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/139/68f/c50/13968fc50b894571b0df182289792fa2.jpg"><br><br>  The socket is omnivorous for operators, so choose one that provides stable reception at the desired point in space and at the same time has a cheap tariff with data transfer.  I had this TELE2 with a package tariff of 90 rubles per month, including 1 GB of traffic.  With MBP payment, you can get by with less money - the traffic socket generates a small one. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/cfd/91d/c28/cfd91dc288934e62a5bd5d72fe69e8c8.jpg"><br><br>  There is also a free option - MTS and Beeline have the opportunity to divide traffic from one package to several devices for free (‚ÄúOne Internet‚Äù and ‚ÄúInternet for All‚Äù, respectively).  If you already have a smartphone with a connected package, then the extra few megabytes per month will not change anything, and you will not have to pay for another package. <br><br>  After the SIM card is inserted and power is supplied to the outlet, you can proceed to control and management.  For this there is a web interface and a mobile application (multiplatform, Android &amp; iOS). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/0d1/93a/a8e/0d193aa8e9ff449c80121f6349413f2b.png"><br><br>  The control capabilities are limited by the outlet's functionality - that is, in fact, you can turn on the load or turn it off.  But there are many ways to implement this ‚Äî a button in the interface, according to the schedule, by timer, or by a given temperature range. <br><br>  However, all these features (except for the button) can be realized by much cheaper devices - network timers or thermostats, which are now sold in abundance.  So for me telemetry is important.  It is implemented by push-messages on the smartphone: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/303/027/130/3030271301ea43e3b418a7e20d185dda.jpg"><br><br>  ... or web-based alerts: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/256/ba4/42b/256ba442bf13454cab4c4ab17777afee.png"><br><br>  In general, the web interface is much richer in features than a mobile application: here you can, for example, take temperature graphs: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/2dd/aa7/3de/2ddaa73de2d34fa2bbd443896de548b5.png"><br><br>  The socket will tell you that the power has disappeared, that the power has appeared, that the limit of the specified temperature range has been reached (and you should rush to save the property), or that the connection is gone - in this case, you can only creak your teeth and guess what it happened there.  Maybe the signal of cellular communication was blown away by the wind, and maybe the house has already burned down and there is nothing to worry about ... <br><br>  One more declared, but unrealized opportunity was found - control over the account status of a SIM card. <br><br>  The manufacturer offers to reflash the device in the service center.  The service is free, but for me it is not so important that it is worth bothering.  When a package tariff, you just have to remember once a month to put money into the account, the balance is not important. <br>  So, I come to the <b>conclusions</b> : <br><br>  <b>Advantages:</b> <br><br>  The device fully implements the declared functionality of temperature telemetry and connection / disconnection upon the command of executive devices.  The temperature is transmitted with a discreteness of every five minutes, the time for passing an on / off command is on average 18-20 seconds.  The stability of work in my conditions is not absolute - a rare but annoying loss of a device from a connection is noted, the cause of which is unclear - most likely, an insufficient level of a cellular signal.  (An external antenna connector would not be superfluous).  There is no such problem in the city. <br><br>  With a price of eight thousand (7990) rubles, this is an affordable solution - there are cheaper devices of similar functionality, but only Senseit GS2 M has, for such a price, the ability to control multiple slave sockets through a single GSM module (they cost less 4950 p).  In addition, this manufacturer has a reputation of reliable and provides full service support in Russia. <br>  My tasks Senseit GS2 M solves even with some overlap - the opportunity, going into a country house, to turn on the fan heater in advance is not critical, but pleasant. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/215/8fa/3c0/2158fa3c0227466fbff8eac2a794f4f2.jpg"><br><br>  <b>Disadvantages and deficiencies:</b> <br><br>  1. The ability to control and, first of all, telemetry via SMS is not realized in the conditions of poor reception of a cellular signal, often outside the city, this would be a salvation from the most unpleasant option: ‚Äúdevice offline, what happened is unknown‚Ä¶‚Äù.  Send a request and receive the answer ‚Äúeverything is OK, the temperature is such and such‚Äù via SMS would be invaluable in this case. <br>  2. As a consequence of the first - unconditional sticking of the device on the Senseit web service.  The company has a good reputation, but anything happens - and with the termination of the service support, the useful device will turn into a pumpkin. <br>  3. It would not hurt the external connector for the antenna.  Moreover, on the board it is <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/dadget/blog/252698/">decoupled</a> . <br>  4. It would be very nice to be able to update the firmware via USB.  Since the connector is still there.  To write drivers and software ... However, it is clear that the manufacturer doesn‚Äôt need complaints from Krivorukov‚Äôs ‚ÄúI-am-brokers‚Äù.  Let them carry in service. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/41c/e4a/bf7/41ce4abf783d42768fc262de112694f3.jpg"><br><br>  In general, the balance of advantages and disadvantages, in my opinion, is in favor of the device, and the price is adequate to the functionality.  If I hadn‚Äôt turned up an opportunity to take a test, I would have bought it myself ( <a href="http://dadget.ru/gsm-rozetka/%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes.ru%26utm_medium%3Darticle%26utm_term%3Dgsm-rozetka%26utm_content%3Dgsm-rozetka%26utm_campaign%3Dgsm-rozetka_153">you can buy it here</a> ).  Thank company Dadzhet for the opportunity to get acquainted with the device. <br><br>  <i>Author Pavel Ievlev, Voronezh.</i> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/391335/">https://habr.com/ru/post/391335/</a></p>
