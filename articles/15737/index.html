  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Kitchen Mysteries and Refrigerator Mysteries</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  When I was an exchange student in the states, I decided to help my ‚Äúhost-mom‚Äù to clean the kitchen.  It led to completely unexpected results - the woman burst into tears and asked me to never do this again.  Not that I'm messing around.  Simply, as it turned out, for her, the kitchen was something holy - where everything lay in certain places and where no one could enter.  It was then that I realized that the kitchen was not at all an ordinary place. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  If you think about it, then there is a great number of kitchen mysteries.  For example - the mystery of the NBP.  The NBP is not Limonov‚Äôs party, but ‚Äúunnecessary household appliances‚Äù.  Such as a sandwich maker, for example.  Or a coffee grinder.  Or a toaster.  People buy them, use them several times, and then take them away forever.  Or give to your friends as soon as they move to their first rented apartment, where there is nothing.  Hey, don't you need a toaster?  And the mixer? <br><br>  A person draws himself a fantasy, as he makes toasts or hot sandwiches to himself in the morning.  And this fantasy is self-valuable.  As soon as the device is bought, the whole mystery disappears. <br><br>  Or take the riddles of the fridge.  Oh, there are a great many refrigerated mysteries.  For example - the secret of the empty saucer.  You open, you come, a refrigerator - and there is an empty saucer.  But you know for sure that you did not put empty dishes there.  So something happened.  But what?  Chicken half ate an apple?  Oil emigrated to a neighbor, because there imported refrigerator?  Salo ordered cheese?

      And the cold castling?  When I was little, the freezer was always on top.  And now it is almost always below.  But I do not remember holding a national referendum on this issue.  I was not asked about this.  And you? <br><br>  No, so it is certainly more convenient, no doubt.  But why did the engineers take some fifty years to change everything?  Maybe they just wanted postebatsya - see how old these idiots will bend over the bow before they ask to swap the fridge and freezer. <br><br>  And the fridge is also like a member of the family.  It grows over the years, have you noticed?  There used to be such small Snayge or ZILy- and now just huge units are sold.  And what is most interesting is that you throw out an old refrigerator, buy a new one, and your wife tells you - see how much free space there is.  But it takes six months - and there is no place to put a new grub. <br><br>  The refrigerator has ceased to be a device for the preservation of food.  Now it's just an intermediate point between the store and the trash can.  People just cook food and put them in the fridge so that they reach the desired condition.  Overgrown with mold.  Began to stink.  Then the products are thrown away, usually with reproach - I bought you a red fish, and you did not eat it. <br><br>  And it happens exactly in expensive delicacies.  I never remember moldy potatoes.  Or onions.  I always spoil either red fish or red caviar.  Because you buy these products - as a gift to yourself, because you are so cool and successful.  But to eat everything on the same day is indecent.  Still expensive.  And then when you clean the soup, you can push the delicacy into the corner.  And forget about him until he started to stink. <br><br>  The smell in the kitchen is also an important part of the mystery.  There are, of course, simple things.  Took, for example, and threw smoked scad into the trash.  And throw out the garbage lazily in the evening.  It is necessary, in an amicable way, because it will stink in the morning, but it is still lazy. <br><br>  You get up in the morning to drink coffee - vonische terrible.  You bend down under the sink to make sure that it is a horse mack, brought the lead to your nose - and calmed down.  Another thing - the stench is unknown.  Even if the stench is not strong - you still need to find the source, otherwise just the roof will move out. <br><br>  And it's cool when the neighbor smell goes on the ventilation duct.  You wife - neighbors chicken fried.  And she to you - yes no, it just burned buckwheat. <br><br>  So the kitchen is the main place in the home.  It‚Äôs not by chance that they say something like ‚Äúhe knows the whole interior kitchen very well, since he worked himself in ...‚Äù.  And the ‚Äúinner bedroom‚Äù or ‚Äúinner toilet‚Äù is not spoken. <br><br>  Another mystery, if you think about it. <br><br>  <a href="http://davydov.blogspot.com/search/label/%25D1%2580%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BF%25D0%25BE%25D1%2580%25D1%2582%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B6%25D0%25B8%2520%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B7%2520%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B7%25D0%25B4%25D1%2580%25D0%25B8">Read old nostril reports</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/15737/">https://habr.com/ru/post/15737/</a></p>
