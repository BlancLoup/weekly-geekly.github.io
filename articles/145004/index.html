      Moscow, May 31, 2012, 9:30, collection at the office of the Metropolitan branch of MegaFon on <a href="http://maps.yandex.ru/-/CNxvZ6Lz">Vyatskaya Street 27, building 42</a> .  We are going to Dmitrov on a huge modern bus.  On the way a light breakfast, juices / tea / coffee.  Information leaflets were also distributed with a brief press release on this data center, which, by the way, can be found <a href="http://moscow.corp.megafon.ru/press/information/20120417-1540.html">on the Megaphone website</a> .  I will quote: <br><blockquote>  The own data processing center of the Stolichny branch of OJSC MegaFon is located in Dmitrov.  Data center resources make it possible to ensure a high level of availability of information systems and data, their protection and preservation, and give the opportunity to manage the processes of ensuring the continuous operation of information systems.  The infrastructure of the complex includes the data center itself, a transformer substation, a diesel generator set, as well as a boiler room and a security post.  In the data center building with a total area of ‚Äã‚Äã2200 square meters.  m. there are 5 auto-rooms, power supply units and a control center.  Power supply system - 1.5 MW.  100% reservation of all communications is realized here.  Fiber-optic lines are connected by different routes, which guarantees uninterrupted data transfer and reliable network operation. <br><br>  ‚ÄúThe data center in Dmitrov was one of the first in the Moscow region to receive a second-level certificate of reliability - TIER II,‚Äù says Pavel Shutikov, head of the sector for the operation of capital facilities of MegaFon.  ‚ÄúThe high‚Äú tensile strength ‚Äùprovided allows for maintenance and preventive maintenance at the data center without stopping the activity, which means uninterrupted provision of telecommunication services to customers even in extreme operating conditions, confident operation of the company's own powerful network and infrastructures discussed at the center of partners.‚Äù <br><br>  Data center resources are available to companies of any profile.  ‚ÄúThe data center is the most important object of our network, which allows us to provide modern telecommunications services to clients in the Moscow region,‚Äù said Tatiana Postnova, director of the North regional department of the Stolichny branch of MegaFon OJSC.  - This includes renting a place in gas stations or racks (Co-location), renting physical and virtual servers, providing software as a service, providing specially designed cloud services (file storages, mail, etc.).  With data center services, our corporate clients can improve business efficiency, get a reliable high-tech infrastructure, and reduce the cost of maintaining the IT infrastructure without compromising its quality and efficiency. ‚Äù </blockquote> <br>  But then we learn from the presentation that the total area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe complex is 5405 km.m, and the total area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe data center is 2370 square meters, where 5 auto-halls are located with a design number of racks equal to 273. <br><br>  Upon arrival at the site ( <a href="http://maps.yandex.ru/-/CNxrnC-h">outlined the scheme of the complex on Ya.Kartah</a> ) we issue daily passes to the regime object.  The guards are friendly, funny, which is very nice.  Also at the entrance near the turnstile we find a very convenient automatic baking-stopper (I photographed at the exit, therefore near an ugly mountain of used boot covers) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/1da/1d1/1ba/1da1d11ba062da83351003dac6149d6a.jpg"><br><br>  and ground floor layout (noted halls / rooms) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/aa1/38e/7f0/aa138e7f0077a6999bc7b4de4293bfb8.jpg"><br><br>  First, a presentation was shown, from which, besides the dry statistics on the data center, we learned that the services of the data center are used by RuTube, Siemens, VTB24 and other large companies (as was said, from 5 computers :)), that servers are rented for cloud computing, and Megafon is in the process of transformation from a basic services operator to an integrated services operator.  It was also said that Megafon will soon enter the market of hosting providers for the masses. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/d42/4c5/a3c/d424c5a3cfcc2d489c56e27d6a3f2d6a.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/c3b/fcb/e6b/c3bfcbe6b97fabcdd73bfb20c2780ce7.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/08e/9e8/3b9/08e9e83b90528ee7332ffce1a853d058.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/ff2/885/496/ff2885496f47c4e4ffc645c0a9eaa205.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/6d7/f9e/c84/6d7f9ec84f5383640ab720c92dbb2f79.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/777/0b1/8eb/7770b18eb88258508383fa826c530593.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/dd1/bfa/b03/dd1bfab038773ed50f384048e135dfcc.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/1a4/274/b1a/1a4274b1a4a7da0fe2fd05a4160403bd.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/dfd/3a8/9a2/dfd3a89a2f8687bbfe0cc818e8ff27c9.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/d60/20a/e00/d6020ae0091e935092d0b581e12f98e4.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/7ab/88a/e0a/7ab88ae0a36a9b87d5f144b7e9174d69.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/e51/f06/154/e51f06154ff90af7bc708f180ce48e6c.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/ba8/cb6/084/ba8cb608499dbb7b321c342644b539fd.jpg"><br><br>  Next, the tour led Pavel Shutikov, as a month earlier <a href="http://video.yandex.ru/users/dmitrovtv/view/209/">for the press</a> . <br><br>  At first we were taken to Avtozal ‚Ññ1.  Temperature, according to Paul, should be kept at a level of 22-23 degrees.  Feels like it was even less. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/b17/1ab/9c3/b171ab9c3fb5ca870da86ffb06751790.jpg"><br><br>  A few things made me think: <br>  - perforation of the raised floor, where cold air comes from, is very rare (unlike other auto salals shown on Habr√© many times); <br>  - the false ceilings are very low and where the warm air goes is also not very clear, maybe of course there are hoods above the ceiling panels, but they were not visible like that; <br>  - many racks are empty at 50-80% (I'm certainly not an expert, but probably the cabinets are not to be empty, apparently for the present the data center does not work at 100%). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/e25/abd/a2e/e25abda2e7657d27d87d5365871bce71.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/256/2f4/56d/2562f456d2023bc71a277ba2bc54ac86.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/08e/065/966/08e065966421a539db3690d2096dff5e.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/922/788/676/9227886762f5b6ee53aecb637266dacb.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/a71/0b4/f5d/a710b4f5d2e2c3d134bcfce8353192dd.jpg"><br><br>  Then we visited the battery <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/605/d2c/c31/605d2cc317e14dc24870f3057899b435.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/e2b/09e/2de/e2b09e2deb74d32911906a60d2afe160.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/186/ac4/067/186ac4067925bb838d1345f4b3069507.jpg"><br><br>  And here is Paul to the left, he is actively gesticulating <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/38b/d1d/be8/38bd1dbe81c5fbb9d51bd8c0c0d87127.jpg"><br><br>  Next we were taken to the hall SGPT (gas extinguishing systems).  On assurances, the gas in this system is completely harmless to humans.  The performance of the system is checked quarterly. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/cfd/695/8d5/cfd6958d59dbe53783123084892d0d17.jpg"><br><br>  And the cylinders are almost human height <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/f34/080/4ff/f340804ff61a91bea39efa884b23903c.jpg"><br><br>  Cylinder grounding <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/925/737/94b/92573794b0d0edb89aa6ba0b4b5eb4aa.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/fef/e12/16e/fefe1216e08eeaf8b1ea44155d9b64e0.jpg"><br><br>  And here we are in Elektroshchitovoy <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/cbb/07b/38a/cbb07b38afbc021290cbf12a8c4455ae.jpg"><br><br>  A technician told us that now the data center consumes 1.5 MW, but the channel is reserved up to 2 MW, i.e.  There is much to grow.  The data center is connected to 2m electric lines (if one fails, the second one is automatically connected).  But if suddenly both of them fail, then diesel generators are included in the work - 4 pieces of 700 kW each (the photos will be lower in the street), i.e.  even with a total consumption of 2 MW, the data center will be provided by 3 generators, and the 4th will be spare in case of failure or repair of one of the generators.  And all of this electric orgy is completed by batteries, which smooth the transitions between power sources and in the most critical situation can support the operation of the system without power (such a huge UPS). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/253/b29/a5f/253b29a5f5bd08dcc4151809d1875a4a.jpg"><br><br>  At the entrance of 396 V (slightly higher than the norm of 380 V) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/b21/2fb/2db/b212fb2db3833ba3805678188adaaddf.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/b8d/96d/046/b8d96d0469d3400bac14d707e7890f51.jpg"><br><br>  Protection first <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/98f/1b7/46d/98f1b746dcb74c9ff76fa8b47f7f91b6.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/cca/577/917/cca57791776b9047ea9d509e560c39cb.jpg"><br><br>  Next we were taken to the second floor in Avtozal ‚Ññ3 <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/d64/4cb/4a0/d644cb4a080fcf655bfffb066630d6ec.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/783/12a/151/78312a1515cc01ebec04fdd6db9ab0b0.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/a92/67f/512/a9267f5121f23cbd691f9b8653ab0d39.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/f68/52e/17d/f6852e17d80e750bf20542aff9fbe956.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/ae1/a1e/d8a/ae1a1ed8ade136667d397fd900fdcffe.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/a2b/dd1/9c0/a2bdd19c0bbab7ce85ad37f17e28a60c.jpg"><br><br>  In the two halls there was only 1 closed corridor (I do not remember the name) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/65e/8a0/385/65e8a03856c99ab23b7397e946a53649.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/ff5/03f/4f0/ff503f4f02afd0e15d85b8fb8c6c9244.jpg"><br><br>  Eyeliner cooling system on the second floor to Avtosalu number 3 <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/296/967/ddf/296967ddf95bd298f07ec2edacb9718b.jpg"><br><br>  Then we happily escaped from the very noisy and rather cold avtozalov outside.  A 72-meter tower, 4 diesel generators (blue containers with exhaust pipes) and a cooling system (gray-green containers) were waiting for us there. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/7bf/560/95b/7bf56095b00df83d2a37407ce0064cb7.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/56b/b72/c61/56bb72c61acce0e966489d6910b130a4.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/412/1f2/283/4121f228303e0aa61930b32d1026529c.jpg"><br><br>  And here is the tower in parts (by span) from top to bottom <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/c12/a16/9da/c12a169daa0373e0f157cf42d30ae4ae.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/b33/85e/aeb/b3385eaeb3b71b9f1934a9998c5ecb68.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/ac2/5d9/11a/ac25d911a99d629c99656c9e184c1301.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/0c3/01d/a18/0c301da1834a074da8ec1f7a0d3bc6d4.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/96b/abe/d72/96babed725164fb9e6f73a53b2c59695.jpg"><br><br>  Impressive building <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/21d/cc7/b89/21dcc7b89e11b75b5b2b9d97893a4c1b.jpg"><br><br>  One of the tower supports <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/fd8/dca/f70/fd8dcaf7059a343f2a473b22e7389ff7.jpg"><br><br>  After the tour, there was a short tea party and the guards checked all the photographs of the visitors for the presence of surveillance cameras and motion sensors (they could not be taken). <br><br>  Well, at the end Megafon gave us certificates and gave us a little bit (well, not bribing it !!! I treat it so respectfully).  A flashlight shines a Megaphone sign (just like Batman's searchlight). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/2ca/b39/aa5/2cab39aa5c1642375d531e4da481a6d0.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/996/03d/bea/99603dbea46a2ab1474efaac6f584674.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/c41/58e/ea1/c4158eea17a875bcbfa3ef2b2c74a057.jpg"><br><br>  P.S.  All full-size photos in <a href="">one archive</a> (112Mb).  If you need to pour more somewhere - specify. <br><br>  P.P.S.  I hope you enjoyed the tour report.  Do not judge strictly for the technical side, because  the tour was non-stop and very fast (less than an hour), plus it was almost impossible to hear Paul in the gas stations if he did not have time to take a seat in the first row of listeners. <br><br>  <b>UPD.</b>  Remembered 2 more facts.  According to Pavel, 10 KW power supply is supplied to the tower.  Under the tower, the signal level was -44dBm. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/145004/">https://habr.com/ru/post/145004/</a></p>
