      If you have such a thought, then once again discovering America, I will say - they will help you: a correctly and clearly set goal;  clearly demarcated terms;  action plan. <br><br><h4>  purpose </h4><br>  Writing down goals is as old as the world, however, I had never thought about recording and planning life as such.  <b>‚ÄúBecoming the tenth ZCE in Kazakhstan‚Äù</b> is one of the first recorded and achieved goals. <br>  In this regard, we <s>technicians</s> do not need to hesitate to learn and learn from tmlidov, project managers and top managers.  Life is not only code, features and bugfixes. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  Timing </h4><br>  The next item was a record of the timing: two months + error of one month.  In fact, the error stretched to two months, there are some reasons not related to work or laziness.  Remember that <b>"Slow progress is better than no progress."</b>  This expression stuck in my head in the course of classes on the bar, or the horizontal bar - as you like.  After all, it is often important to just go, and it does not matter that it is slow at times. <br><br><ul><li>  15 days to read the manual "from and to"; </li><li>  15 days for video tutorials and practice; </li><li>  2 hours per day. </li></ul><br>  Even if you stick to your schedule at 90% and approach the deadline when you need to buy a voucher - one human factor can interfere with you - is it fear or how do designers say <i>‚ÄúComic Sans effect‚Äù</i> when it seems that you don‚Äôt completed that you need a bit more to prepare.  How to overcome this, I will tell further. <br><br><h4>  Action plan </h4><br>  As noted above, the mandatory process of studying the manual is highlighted, - your faithful friend and comrade. <br>  From the video tutorials, I looked only about SPL, about some features of SAX-XML and about streams, streams. <br><br>  Key topics for certification are provided on the <a href="http://www.zend.com/en/services/certification/php-5-certification">List of Exam Topics</a> page. <br><br>  Departing from them and studying something extra is not important, although I‚Äôll clarify that I have studied the XML, XPath and Regex specifications separately. <br><br>  The prelude to 15 + 15 days was to read the <a href="http://www.zend.com/en/services/certification/php-certification-study-guide">PHP Certification Study Guide</a> . <br><br>  Some circumstances contributed to narrowing the wallet and being satisfied with version 5.3 - I do not regret it, but you need to read this guide before the manual.  It is clear that there is a difference between the first and last versions. <br><br>  In the first chapters of the guide, you will be provided with information about the process of the testing itself, the number of questions, the time you need to meet.  I write a separate paragraph advise the most accented chapters for which it is supposed - give the highest scores. <br><br>  Here is what it looks like: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e78/20b/806/e7820b806b2844c995adc5e5b8a79ad4.jpg"><br><br>  In the process of preparation, I found it convenient to use the Trello service and moved all the topics and chapters to the ‚ÄúTODO‚Äù column. <br>  And here is the result - all amicably lined up in the column ‚ÄúDone‚Äù: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b5a/a64/196/b5aa6419656d4368998d06850599fce1.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Separate virtual host for note-taking and practice: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ff9/3af/4e1/ff93af4e1f404ad6bd28411c89edb302.jpg"><br><br><h4>  Passing trial tests </h4><br>  <a href="http://www.zend.com/">Zend Technologies</a> provides an opportunity to buy test tests that cost more than the voucher itself, so <a href="http://zend-php.appspot.com/questions_list">this auxiliary resource</a> will be quite sufficient. <br><br>  Only 171 questions, 35 pages.  You can go all at once, can be divided into slices of 10/35 pages. <br><br>  Your task: pass the test, highlight all your weaknesses, repeat them and again pass the test.  90-99 out of 100% - and you can proceed to the next step - to purchase a voucher. <br><br><h4>  What did I do? </h4><br>  As expected, a natural continuation should be the purchase of a voucher and the passing of the test, but - <b>‚ÄúComic Sans effect‚Äù</b> : ‚ÄúI will recheck the knowledge;  I will repeat some chapters. ‚Äù <br><br>  Strange as it may seem, <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2593%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B9_%25D0%25AE%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B9_%25D0%25A6%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B7%25D0%25B0%25D1%2580%25D1%258C">Guy Julius Caesar</a> and the expression <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259F%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B9%25D1%2582%25D0%25B8_%25D0%25A0%25D1%2583%25D0%25B1%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BA%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BD">‚ÄúGo Rubicon‚Äù</a> helped to overcome this threshold.  I cast lots, bought a voucher and crossed my Rubicon.  There is no way back, if you do not appear at a specified time in the test center, then your voucher is burned. <br><br>  The day before the tests, you need to take a good rest, and at the test itself - not to be nervous.  Lack of rest and tension will disturb you in the process itself. <br><br>  Although, about the "not nervous" - I embellished.  ‚ÄúDon't worry, you have already done everything, what will be - it will be‚Äù - he told himself;  For the last 10 minutes, I struggled with this state and was able to persuade me internally only for 89 minutes. <br><br>  2 seconds, 1 second, zero - and this window and relief in the shower. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/509/202/406/5092024060d54f5eb57fe5ca2f1bbb35.jpg"><br><br>  Intentionally did not specify the process of buying a voucher, confusing issues and other topics that were disclosed by previous certified Habr specialists. <br><br><h4>  Profit </h4><br>  In addition to PHP: strong academic knowledge in Regex, XML and related technologies, in streams. <br>  He began to read more carefully manuals and references for other products and programming languages.  Hi <b>Python</b> ! <br><br><h4>  Total </h4><br>  The goal is achieved.  The tenth ZCE in the country and the second in version 5.5. <br><br>  I believe and hope that it will turn out to make some of you decide and get your certificate.  Do not be afraid to challenge yourself.  A certificate will not make you the coolest specialist - this is achieved empirically, through trial and error, and other various factors, but a challenge that is thrown and fulfilled - gives a lot of positive emotions. <br><br>  I would be very happy to answer your questions.  Thank. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/246461/">https://habr.com/ru/post/246461/</a></p>
