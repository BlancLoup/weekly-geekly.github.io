But what is easy to lose is that she did not lie, ‚ÄùI thought back.  One gets the feeling that such dialogues occur in the heads of millions of people on the planet: celebrities, billionaires and simple disorderly users.  It seems that they are saved or they constantly create a backup of their own memory dump in their heads, and gadgets do not break and are not lost.  We have nothing more to explain the fact that the total damage from data leakage in 2015 amounted to more than $ 27 billion, and the average damage from one leakage increased from $ 25.29 million in 2014 to $ 33.22 million in 2015, and an absolute leakage leadership - 43% - from the public sector.  Day by day, more and more stories about lost data and information leaks appear.  Judge for yourself. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/55a/3c7/076/55a3c707643b58e8562b5ba228c2abc4.jpg"></div><br><a name="habracut"></a><h2>  <font color="#00204D">But who needs my data!</font> </h2><br>  Guys, we have bad news for you - each of us has a data carrier, which sooner or later someone will need. <br><br><ul><li>  <b>Payment data</b> (PIN-codes, numbers and dumps of plastic cards, SIM-card information and even a dump from an NFC chip) is the most tasty piece for cyber frauds of all levels.  This information can be used to cash out funds, pay for goods and false data when committing criminal offenses.

    </li><li>  <b>Personal data</b> (passport data, mail, phone number) is also very valuable information.  At best, spammers and companies will gladly buy it and they will call you and send you newsletters about services.  At worst, you can become the owner of a loan or lose money, or even be involved in an unpleasant story with fake documents. <br><br></li><li>  <b>Commercial data</b> - the main value of the business.  And the further, the greater the cost of information loss.  Here the range of hackers is endless: from simple data corruption to competitive intelligence and theft of client bases.  Among other things, the company may incur reputational risks due to the loss of customer data (MegaFon and Salesforce are still alive in the memory).  By the way, if the company has corporate software and no backups, this is completely in vain.  After all, besides hackers, there are unscrupulous employees who, with or without dismissal, can cause irreparable damage to commercial information. <br></li></ul><br>  How do we lose?  Just store all the eggs in one basket. <br><br><ul><li>  Data can be damaged due to a malicious virus - with a good antivirus, the story is unlikely, but does everyone have it?  Recall at least the recent history of the virus from the mail attachment - many he spoiled his nerves. <br><br></li><li>  Intentional hacking, including the services you use.  As we have already said, our accounts and user data are very interesting information for fraudsters and unscrupulous business representatives.  That is why so often there is information about mass hacking. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f83/126/303/f83126303f29ad798234c6de256b0135.png"></div><br></li><li>  Accidental deletion of information - you yourself can inadvertently erase important files.  This is a very annoying phenomenon, but it is found everywhere.  Most often this happens when a part of the storage media is freed. <br><br></li><li>  Damage to the media.  Probably, there is no person who, at the dawn of the existence of external hard drives, would not encounter their sudden death from a fall, concussion, or just that.  (Already we will not remind about demagnetized floppy disks with computer science courses students, not everyone is so old on Habr√©).  Similarly, microSD may be damaged if the phone is dropped.  Backups and backup storage will save the situation. <br><br></li><li>  The loss or theft of the media can lead not only to the loss of your favorite photos and contacts, but also to real problems - if the lost device has payment information and logins / passwords in the browser, you can cause significant damage to the owner. <br><br></li><li>  Operating system malfunctions can also cause data loss. <br><br></li><li>  And this, too;) </li></ul><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f3c/f0a/7ab/f3cf0a7abf167ff43b89b5f688a8e55b.jpg"></div><br>  <i>- Look over my shoulder and die!</i> <br><br>  It is impossible to insure against everything - in some cases the users themselves are powerless to take any measures.  But, of course, it is no coincidence that <a href="http://www.worldbackupday.com/ru/">World Backup Day</a> (March 31) takes place on the eve of the fool's day, because most of the security holes arise through the fault of the user himself.  And it concerns all. <br><br>  Only facts, only hardcore <br><br><h2>  <font color="#00204D">Smash Google Thunder!</font> </h2><br>  Case one in a million.  Not one million ... Dollars ... Google announced the irrevocable destruction of a small part of the data due to a lightning hit the Google data center in Belgium.  August 13, 2015 - Lightning struck the data center power system four times in a row.  This briefly de-energized the data processing center, in which the client virtual machines were running using the Google Cloud Platform (GCP) and storing their data there.  Google experts noted that in the period from August 13 to 17, 2015, virtual machines had I / O errors when trying to access network drives connected to them.  In general, at least one I / O error occurred in approximately 5% of network drives in the European zone.  In addition, during this period, <a href="http://www.cnews.ru/news/top/v_datacentre_google_unichtozheny_dannye">it was not possible to</a> perform some management operations, such as creating snapshots.  For Google, this is not such a big part of the data, but what were the companies whose information and processes suffered.  Now they know that there are lightning in the clouds. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#00204D">What kind of "reckless" people in Hollywood!</font> </h2><br>  Celebrities are probably not very concerned about the affairs of the earth, and often not so baked about personal data.  Thanks to their carelessness, the world periodically sees the ‚Äúnude‚Äù collections, finds out first about the innovations of technology and music, enjoys the personal correspondence of show business stars and politicians.  Someone will say that this is cheap PR!  Not a fact, it‚Äôs just the inability to back up and protect your data. <br><br>  <a href="http://www.infowatch.ru/analytics/leaks_monitoring/18268">An employee of</a> one of the Hollywood film studios intended to throw several boxes of paper into the trash, but was stopped by an information security expert.  The expert bought the contents of the boxes and found a paper catalog with personal data of American celebrities.  Including full names, social security numbers and phones of Alec Baldwin, Kevin Bacon, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Donald Trump. <br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ef8/ea2/92a/ef8ea292a974406f8a3f5be7d244a8c4.png"></div><br>  <a href="http://www.vladtime.ru/kriminalnie_novosti/446659-dima-bilan-prokommentiroval-ograblenie-svoego-osobnyaka.html">In September</a> 2015, the mansion of the popular singer Dmitry Bilan was robbed.  His <s>voice</s> was stolen <s>,</s> not only from a safe with a large sum of money, but also from hard drives with recordings of his speeches. <br><br>  In July 2015, on Twitter, rap artist Vasily Oblomov, an entry appeared ‚ÄúDoes anyone who reads me know a way to recover the files erased from MacBook?  Removed from the trash.  Restore data using Time Machine for some reason did not work.  In general, Oblomov went bummer.

First of all, the hackers began to ‚Äúclean‚Äù Zverev's page on Instagram, then removed the materials from the YouTube video hosting service, and finally, completely deleted the video blogs.  Yes, these are not <s>wolves shameful</s> hackers, they are orderlies <s>of the</s> Internet <s>forest</s> . <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/812/d10/8b9/812d108b9e9f91c8b474c27f4d477c3b.gif"></div><br><br>  But social networks and YouTube know a lot about backups and the mission, alas, failed. <br><br>  But without loss of irony and sarcasm loss.  In April 2015, Kirk Hammett, the lead guitarist of the Metallica group, admitted that work on the new album may be slowed down because the musician lost his iPhone six months ago.  On the phone in a single copy were stored 250 ready-made guitar parts - more than half of those that were recorded for the record.  We only managed to recall eight.  Kirk, old man, how is it so ?!  Come to us in <a href="http://www.acronis.com/">Acronis</a> , we will show everything.  We are this ... we can not without it here: <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/Lli99OmkPwM%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700023,15700186,15700190,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhhsB1sazfo-8smONGhxDrKONplLOg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  As you can see, nobody is insured against epic files.  Have you ever been among these people too?  Tell your story about data loss in the comments - you need more trash, hardcore and horror stories!  We are ready in every way to console the victims of the lack of backups and give the most comforting gifts, for example, a music speaker and keys for <a href="http://www.acronis.com/ru-ru/personal/online-backup/">Acronis True Image Cloud</a> with an <b>unlimited cloud</b> .  We will sum up the results on March 31!  And announce the winners! <br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e6d/310/712/e6d3107126c6ff9b364967cdf65d2196.gif"></div>  Data will be stolen, stolen and stolen.  This is an essential attribute of the era of informatization, one cannot escape it.  Hackers can be guided by a simple passion, the desire to get personal and behavioral data for spamming, resale, blackmail and other cybercrime.  But even if you do not have millions of accounts in the best banks of Switzerland, a hundred gigabytes of compromising materials, a database of customer movements across hypermarkets and 250 epochal electric guitar solos, you should still make backups.  We all have something to lose: a diploma, memorable photos and videos, work files, a program code, collected music collections bit by bit. <br><br>  <b>Do not make yourself nerves, you still live with them!</b> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/280316/">https://habr.com/ru/post/280316/</a></p>
