  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How to become a good programmer?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Dear habouiers, I know that you prefer tasty little posts than reflections and all sorts of different questions-polls.  But that month already has a headache for me from the same question - how to become a good programmer (I will describe below what I mean).  The question is this: <br><br>  Since childhood I began to get involved in the creation of sites.  From the 6th grade I made the first site for my school, taught HTML and inserted various ready-made Java Scripts into my small sites.  I started to buy useful literature and learn CSS and HTML.  Later in the 9th grade I learned how to program in Delphi.  School Pascal will not indicate - it all passed. <br><br>  Then I scored on this case, I was engaged in business for several years and decided to remember the youth and go to study at the Computer Academy.  Two and a half years spent on training for a web designer.  Programming with ++ didn‚Äôt work for me at all, how much I didn‚Äôt try to smoke it - it didn‚Äôt work either.  But I liked PCP very much, especially at that time I was captured by the withdrawal of information from databases and began to develop in this direction.  I made a website for one client on my engine (which I wrote from the books of our programmers) - an online catalog, I invested half a year in promotion.  The site began to make a profit, and more and I began to do business again, scoring on programming. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  In short, I returned to training several times and yesterday I re-enrolled for annual courses on the study of php, zend and a whole list of innovations in programming.

      Why the question was: How to become a good programmer? <br>  I can copy the code and change it, peek at how someone does it and do the same, sometimes add simple scripts, but it‚Äôs impossible to create some kind of tool in programming.  That is, there are people who invent the formulas of drugs, but there are those who simply copy their formulas and repeat the finished open truths according to the textbook. <br><br>  When I went on interviews for the php-programmer - I was given such unpretentious logic puzzles (and I like it) and PHP that I needed to solve myself without the Internet.  Well, who got a job and takes on a job in the course about the tasks that are usually asked at interviews.  I even downloaded a book of these ready-made tasks and tried to memorize - but at work I could no longer remember the minute details and fell through. <br><br>  Many people cannot become 3D designers due to the lack of a certain ‚Äúvisual way of thinking‚Äù (I don‚Äôt know how to say it right).  They represent figures and objects in their heads and see them differently from the rest of which good models in the same 3d max can make. <br><br>  Is it exactly the same in programming?  If now it is impossible to solve simple logic tasks with the basic knowledge of pkhp, then I will not be able to become a real artist but only an imitator? <br><br>  Have you done this and if so share your experience, I will be very grateful! <br>  How did you go from beginner to developer? <br>  Thank. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/226461/">https://habr.com/ru/post/226461/</a></p>
