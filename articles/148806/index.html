  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The most important motivation</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/3a4/7c8/cf2/3a47c8cf28c0fdf6214133332b2918eb.png" alt="image"><br>  Wikipedia gives some difficult definition of what motivation is.  I would describe motivation more matheforically, using the example of a game hero.  Motivation is an elixir, after which the hero uses the level of strength and desire for new challenges.  The higher the power level, the stronger the penetration or defensive power.  When applied to work, motivation is an incentive for action that leads to an increase in employee strength.  Increasing the strength of the employee gives him more confidence and energy in solving problems, as well as in dealing with difficulties.  A manager who does not ensure that an employee has a sufficient supply of elixir will, sooner or later, become tense with a fall in the desire for new challenges. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Employee motivation is an essential element of a successful company.  In recent years as a leader, I have read many books and articles on various types of motivation and its application.  One of the most interesting is the book by Adrian Gostik and Chester Elton, The Carrot Principle.  The newest trend in the employee motivation system. "  Knowing almost all types of motivations and observing how they affect people, especially after analyzing the reasons for dismissal of employees and the reasons for finding another job from candidates for interviews, I came to the conclusion that there is one important motivation, without which other types of motivation are useless or work limited time. <br><br>  In motivation can be divided into four large groups: material, intangible, internal and external.  At present, the topic is being actively discussed that intangible motivation is the strongest and companies should focus on it.  Free coffee, a good office, the opportunity to attend the best conferences and public recognition (anyone can add their motivation to this list) - all this is non-financial motivation.  In one book, an example is given that even a table by the window is considered an element of motivation.

      In opposition to them are supporters of material motivation.  They consider that all this is useful and pleasant, but the level of salary and bonuses is much more important.  For the achievement of the project or company is better to pay bonuses.  This money will have a greater effect than non-financial motivation and even more than wages.  For my part, I am convinced that the most important motivation must be sought in a different direction. <br><br>  Many managers believe that creating and implementing motivational programs is an HR task, and they should just use it.  This is a big mistake.  Relying on HR, companies invest heavily in motivational programs, whether they are employee time or money.  But despite the introduction of motivation programs and even a good level of salary, employees still leave.  It doesn't matter from which company, a large corporation with a great image, like Apple, Google, Facebook, or a small startup.  The most common reason for dismissal is the absence of the most important motivation that no HR can provide. <br><br>  For an employee, the most important thing is what he does and in what environment, as well as an understanding of what he will do in the future and what career prospects he has.  In other words, the work itself is a motivator.  Since I am from IT, I will give an example with a programmer.  For such a specialist, it is important what kind of product or system he develops, how technically complex this product is, what technologies, frameworks and libraries he uses and which development process.  Plus, the programmer must see and believe in the prospects for career growth.  For example, he should have the opportunity to grow to a team leader, project manager or department head. <br><br>  If a programmer doesn‚Äôt like the product he is developing, doesn‚Äôt like the technologies he uses or he wants to become a team leader but doesn‚Äôt see any growth opportunities, he will definitely quit.  Will finish the current project and leave.  At the same time, it does not matter what kind of salary he had, how good the office is, and how sweet the corporate buns are. <br><br>  As a result, I believe that if you cannot provide the most important motivation for your employee, he needs to convey this clearly and offer assistance in finding another job.  In parallel, and not when the employee ‚Äúunexpectedly‚Äù quit, you should start looking for a replacement for him.  So it will be fair in relation to him and to you. <br><br>  I will add that the most important motivation does not work if the employee has inadequately low salary or the company has a terrible culture.  The basic levels of demand for the Maslow pyramid should be implemented in any case. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/148806/">https://habr.com/ru/post/148806/</a></p>
