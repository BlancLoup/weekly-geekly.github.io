      True, I have a principle: not to introduce any innovations thoughtlessly, even if they are asked by a million users.  I embed a new functionality in the program while respecting its ideology and - most importantly - I try to maintain backward compatibility of backups.  That is, if you made your backups back in TB 2.0, you can always deploy them using the latest version of TB.  So update boldly, I watch it. <br><br>  <b>Tell me about a couple of extraordinary user requests?</b> <br><br>  Hmm, it's not very easy for me to answer here.  There are a lot of applications, but do not forget that the main core of TB users is enthusiasts.  And they usually want spherical horses, which are generally useless to the majority of consumers. <br><br>  For example, some wanted to save backups to servers and be sure to encrypt the data channel.  There was a request to make an update.zip with Titanium Backup embedded inside ( <i>this file is automatically recognized by Android when it is loaded as an OS update and is installed by itself</i> - approx. Ed.) Although I found the request with backup schedules quite reasonable and implemented it recently. <br><br>  Quite a strange request sounded something like this: ‚ÄúI want to raise backups made only in firmware X or Y‚Äù.  Of course, I can write such code, but a) I have to think hard and b) who needs this feature besides the one who asked?  Well, I am a responsive guy and after this request I made it so that each new backup contains a tag with the name of the firmware, its version, etc. <br><br>  <b>Say, because most of the phones are not rutted.</b>  <b>And you made it so that TB simply does not start without privileged access.</b>  <b>Do you plan to make a version of TB for phones with stock firmware?</b> <br><br>  I agree, no legs - no cartoons (s).  Well, put yourself another backup and backup them, I do not mind.  As I said, at the level of capabilities for phones with stock firmware MyBackup Pro is comparable to TB. <br><br>  Technically, it is impossible to do more on the stock firmware than MyBackup Pro can do.  I understand this perfectly well and plan to release a ‚Äúsimplified‚Äù version of TB for phones without root.  Today, I will repeat the words of one of my loyal users: ‚ÄúNafik Android for me, which has no root?‚Äù I join with the words: ‚Äúprivileged access gives you REAL power over the device.  This is cool and many people like it. <br><br>  <b>Let's talk about the functionality.</b>  <b>Now TB makes backup copies of applications and data.</b>  <b>Would you like to make TB a ‚Äúswiss backup knife‚Äù?</b>  <b>After all, you can still make backups of SMS, APN, call history, browser bookmarks, surfing history on the Web, contacts not from Google‚Äôs address book (they are not synced by Android - ed.).</b>  <b>Do not think that I do not know that TB can do almost all of the above, just ask a question about development plans.</b> <br><br>  Well, you yourself answered - TB backup in general, everything you can reach in Android.  So in this sense, he is already the knife. <br><br>  In general, the biggest ambush in TB is its usability.  Now for me it is the main priority.  I think that I will do a ‚Äúsimple start‚Äù mode with access to the most popular functions, and I will hide the rest.  Those who are in the subject, will find the necessary buttons in any case, and the majority will be "easy" and convenient.  But here we must think that everything will turn out ... <br><br>  <b>A good start, it is really important to make TB comfortable.</b>  <b>Okay, now some lyrics.</b>  <b>On the XDA forum, you are known by the nickname Keramidas.</b>  <b>Where did you get it from?</b> <br><br>  Oh, I do not remember.  I came up with it once.  In general, I am better known as NumLOCK.  This nickname came from the time of the strong hobby of fractals, from the project Demomaker. <br><br>  <b>How much time do you pay for TB support per week?</b> <br><br>  That being said, it depends.  When how, but on average at least 8 hours a week.  It takes a lot of time when I'm really passionate about the next revision.  I can not sleep at night.  Well, probably it is all so ... <br><br>  <b>Listen, I forgot to clarify in the question about development plans.</b>  <b>Now Android is embedded anywhere: on TVs, cars, refrigerators.</b>  <b>If such devices really become massive, will you, huh, equip TB with the function ‚Äúboil beer in the fridge‚Äù?</b> <br><br>  Why not?  If new specific data appears for new devices, TB will backup them.  I will say even this: if it becomes interesting to someone to make a custom firmware, I will be interested in making a TB for this device. <br><br>  <b>And what do you think about whether the built-in backup program will appear in future versions of Android?</b>  <b>If it appears, what will you do?</b> <br><br>  Kill myself up the wall, of course.  Joke. <br><br>  In fact, they are unlikely to backup user applications.  Although most likely the system data will somehow be backed up for sure.  Get at least the same SMS / MMS. <br><br>  I will only be glad, because now backup SMS and MMS is a weak point of TB.  In the sense of restoring such backups on a strongly new version of Android (for example, when migrating from 1.5 to 2.x - approx. Ed.) It may not work at all.  So if Google does this for us, I‚Äôm not upset.  It will not be necessary to suffer with a code about this. <br><br>  <b>Do you think Google is the Empire of Evil or is it not?</b>  <b>Or (in a whisper) you can not tell the truth, because they immediately banned your developer account?</b> <br><br>  I think they have a huge responsibility in collecting and processing the personal data of hundreds of millions of users.  From this point of view, there are reasons to consider them as the Empire of Evil.  But in fact, it all depends on their choice.  Begin to use this data to your advantage - drown themselves.  I think Google understands this, smart people work there.  And clearly not evil. <br><br>  <b>Now you have a Nexus One, it used to be the HTC Hero.</b>  <b>Why did you change the phone?</b>  <b>And which phones did you use before?</b>  <b>And also: what do you say about the great iPhone?</b> <br><br>  Yes, I would not change Hero, I have enough of it.  But it so happened that TB got into the list of applications-winners of the Google Android Market Seeding for Top Android Developers program ( <i>more than 5000 downloads, 3.5 star rating at least</i> - Ed.).  It happened on February 28, 2010.  A week later they sent me a Nexus.  Well, of course, I did not refuse such a gift. <br><br>  Past phones were: Nokia N82, and even earlier Sony-Ericsson W800i.  I'm not particularly picky about devices, to be honest.  I liked the SE with excellent picture quality and a long-lasting battery.  Nokia also filmed wow, had more software frills and options, but ate a battery terribly. <br><br>  And: why is the iPhone great?  The telephone is like a telephone.  I was holding it in my hands, but somehow I was not inspired.  Glamorous toy, that's all. <br><br>  <b>What do you think about the problem of segmentation versions of Android?</b>  <b>Does it bother you somehow?</b> <br><br>  Of course not.  TB works on any available version of Android. <br><br>  The problem, of course, is.  But I think that Google will quickly deal with it. <br><br>  Fragmentation limits development and adversely affects users.  For example, Photoshop under 1.5 - complete garbage, just half of the functions do not.  They cannot be implemented due to platform limitations.  Well, who needs such a program? <br><br>  In short, Google has everything you need to solve this problem.  Well, and we, the developers, deserve some care about ourselves. <br><br>  <b>And the last question for today: what is your impression of the Android Market?</b>  <b>What is the reason, in your opinion, the delay in the opening of Google‚Äôs paid Market in other countries where Android devices are already being sold?</b> <br><br>  By itself, the Market has constructed well.  I would put him 8.5 points out of 10. <br><br>  Of course, Google is wrong with closing the paid Market for most countries. <br><br>  I think the problem here is not even so much the penetration of Google Checkout and PayPal to local markets, but in OPCoS.  They just can not understand that they are a commonplace pipe for transmitting traffic from Google to the communicator and back.  This is not their business at all, can I use tethering bullshit (a function that turns a communicator into a WiFi access point based on mobile Internet - Ed.).  Or this shutdown of mobile Internet unlimited tarfies - well, not reptiles?  We will change providers for more adequate ones, anyway, we won‚Äôt take money from us, we know how to manage our freedoms. <br><br>  In general, something like that.  Thank you for your attention and support to all Russian-speaking TB users and readers of this interview.  I am very grateful to you for your loyalty and wish you all the best. <br><br>  Jo√´l <br><br>  <a href="http://matrixrewriter.com/">Author's site</a> <br>  <a href="http://androidforme.com/archives/145">Review in Russian Titanium Backup</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/99771/">https://habr.com/ru/post/99771/</a></p>
