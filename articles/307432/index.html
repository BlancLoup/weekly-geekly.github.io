Let's talk about situations where the number of user groups is not significant, but that they all use mobile devices.  The topic is relevant, but only two cases got into our sample.  There is nothing terrible in this - we will try to ‚Äúsqueeze‚Äù out of these cases a maximum of information about the specifics of using qualitative methods for solving UX-problems in these conditions. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Case 10. Answer Lab: the mobile version of Wikipedia.</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><h3>  Case 10. Answer Lab: the <a href="http://www.answerlab.com/clients/case-studies/wikipedia-study/">mobile version of Wikipedia.</a> </h3><br>  The number of users who consume content on the Internet via mobile devices is growing every year.  Wikipedia needed to develop a strategy for switching to mobile devices in order to remain in demand among its users.  To develop such a strategy, you need to understand how people get access to the content, look for the necessary information and consume it.  In addition, it is important to present the editing process on a laptop and mobile devices.  To collect data on all these issues, Wikipedia representatives turned to the Answer Lab. <br><br>  The company was given a number of rather difficult tasks: <br><ul><li>  find out what role mobile devices play in the lives of users; </li><li>  identify behavioral features, preferences, barriers and technologies that affect the use of mobile devices and applications; </li><li>  understand how the mobile version of Wikipedia will be used on different platforms; </li><li>  determine what are the opportunities and barriers when editing text on a mobile platform. </li></ul><br>  The Answer Lab realized that ethnography is indispensable.  The team organized surveillance of users working from different devices in their natural environment, and also conducted two-hour interviews at home.  In addition, they used data collected through telephone interviews and from feedback on working with Wikipedia. <br><br>  The results of the study were documented in a report, where recommendations were made for improving readability, search and navigation on various devices.  Additionally, information was provided necessary for the development of mobile and tablet applications. <br></div></div><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Case 11. U1: mobile version of the VicRoads website</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><h3>  Case 11. U1: <a href="http://www.u1group.com/_embeds/case_study/vicroads%3Fsite-call%3D1">mobile version of the VicRoads website</a> </h3><br>  The Australian company VicRoads helps drivers: its website provides all the necessary information for planning trips (traffic jams, repairs, travel time, etc.), obtaining a driver's license, car registration, traffic rules - and even plans for building roads.  In general, a storehouse of information for drivers.  In order to support even more users, the company launched a mobile version of the site.  The logical solution, since the majority of users are driving.  Launched, and then decided to find out whether it is convenient for motorists, whether their needs meet on the road.  The company did not have enough recommendations to improve the mobile version of the site.  For this, they came to U1.

        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"

      <br>
      To give their recommendations, U1 experts decided to conduct a comprehensive study using qualitative and quantitative methods, which included desk research (search for information in open sources), Google Analytics, surveys and interviews.  The study provided valuable data on user mental models and behavior when accessing the mobile version of the site. <br><br>  Based on the data collected, recommendations were made to improve the mobile version of the site.  VicRoads received valuable information about its users: how they reason and what they expect from the mobile version of the site. </div></div><br><h3>  * * * </h3><br>  What can a qualitative methodology give when our goal is to switch to a mobile platform or improve an existing mobile version?  Let's figure it out.  Social researchers developed a qualitative methodology, inter alia, to collect detailed data on how people‚Äôs daily lives are structured.  This information certainly takes into account the context: we see not only what a person does, but where, and how he does it.  If we translate it into the language of UX-research, this means that we get a detailed description of life situations and the environment of use of the product.  This information is necessary in order to develop good mobile versions.  The cases reviewed by us show that qualitative data is easily transformed into practical recommendations for the development of mobile versions.  Such IT-products are as close as possible to the daily life of users - with their help they solve their real problems (life situations) with maximum comfort (environment of use). <br><br>  Summarizing what has been said: the use of qualitative methodology in the transition to mobile devices provides valuable information about life situations and the environment of use.  This data becomes the basis for practical recommendations on the development or improvement of mobile versions. <br><hr><br>  <i>All parts of the article: <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/sobakapavlova/blog/306946/">1</a> |</i>  <i><a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/sobakapavlova/blog/307192/">2</a> |</i>  <i><b>3</b> |</i>  <i><a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/sobakapavlova/blog/307440/">4</a> |</i>  <i><a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/sobakapavlova/blog/307442/">5</a> |</i>  <i><a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/sobakapavlova/blog/307444/">6</a></i> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/307432/">https://habr.com/ru/post/307432/</a></p>
