  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Universal charging for gadgets do it yourself</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Every modern person at home can find from one to infinity a gadget - be it mobile phones (everyone has an old Siemens at home ...), players and other useful and not-so-great things.  As a rule, all of them have network adapters for recharging - and, of course, each network adapter does not fit the connector to anything other than its ‚Äúowner‚Äù.  The most annoying thing is that even the same manufacturer uses different connectors in different models (another plus in Siemens karma - before acquiring them Benq, all the phones that went through me - had the same connector). <br><br><img src="http://www.picamatic.com/show/2010/04/25/04/54/6826755_627x457.png" alt="network charger zoo"><br><br>  Such a zoo and I watched at home.  And all this lasted until I decided to buy a bluetooth GPS receiver GlobalSat BT-821, which, to my regret, did not have a network adapter at all - just an automobile one.

      The problem appeared - the problem was solved! <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  At first I decided to take the path of the least resistance.  Since the receiver was still charging (in principle, it‚Äôs also convenient to charge it in the car. That's just one problem - the closest car is with the brother), I found an inexpensive network / car noname adapter (~ $ 9).  He was in the same store - ordered, waited for the call.  However, unfortunately (or fortunately) he was not there.  Fail. <br><br>  The second attempt was to purchase a network charger from-another-gadget-with-the-same-connector.  On one of the forums I missed a note that the charger from the HP IPAQ HX 4700 PDA is suitable for this receiver. Everything would be fine, but: <br><ol><li>  There was no guarantee that fit </li><li>  +1 to chaos </li><li>  Price $ 18 </li></ol><br><br>  These three points did not give me rest all the time that I walked to the store (I decided to check on the spot whether it was suitable or not).  And SUDDENLY it dawned on me - why, with this choice of ready-made workers at home, why should I have one more?  After all, the original connector is.  Heap charge too.  Why not do universal charging?  For this, I needed some tools. <br><br>  Because I turned into the radio engineering department.  I live in a rented apartment, because of the tools only an ax and a file.  So, we need at least: <br><ol><li>  Soldering iron - was available.  True, the monster is a lot of watts with a huge sting, but enough </li><li>  Solder / Rosin - bought for a little money </li><li>  A tester / probe (so as not to mislead a plus with a minus) - was absent - was assembled from a diode, a light bulb and two wires </li><li>  Connectors / plugs - according to the number of charges - I took 2 connectors and two jack-type plugs, metal, of a beautiful golden color </li><li>  Insulating tape - so far without it!  The whole world is kept on electrical tape ... </li><li>  Suitable chargers.  Here there was a small problem.  As read the inscription on the gps-receiver - it needs 1A charging current, all the chargers that I have - give a current ~ 0.5A, and only the charger for the Nokia 5530XM gives a current of 890mA - I chose it for preparation </li></ol><br><br><img src="http://www.picamatic.com/show/2010/04/25/04/54/6826754_341x268.png" alt="connectors"><br><br>  So, everything is collected in one pile on the floor - we proceed. <br><br>  As I said, I did not have a tester - because of the diode at hand (hint: you can find it in any old and unnecessary tape recorder / phone, etc.) and light bulbs (it is better to take it with a voltage of ~ 5V so that it does not burn out. I was at 3.5V - I played my role perfectly!) solder the simplest probe and test it on two AA batteries. <br><br><img src="http://www.picamatic.com/show/2010/04/25/04/55/6826771_298x201.png" alt="tester :)"><br><br>  That end of the wire, which is a ‚Äúplus‚Äù - mark it with a piece of electrical tape - so as not to forget.  Now we proceed to the preparation of the chargers: we cut pieces of the same length from each of them (then, if we rearrange them among themselves, the original length will not change - -1 to chaos). <br><br><img src="http://www.picamatic.com/show/2010/04/25/04/55/6826768_499x383.png" alt="the patient is more dead than alive"><br><br>  When stripping wires, an unexpected difficulty arose: in car charging there were three wires instead of two. <br><br><img src="http://www.picamatic.com/show/2010/04/25/04/54/6826762_315x270.png" alt="and what's that for reindeer?"><br><br>  By an effort of effort (and a sound of a plug), it was decided that the yellow wire was an extra piece.  After stripping and tinning the wires are carefully soldered to the connectors - with each step, the polarity is checked. <br><br><img src="http://www.picamatic.com/show/2010/04/25/04/54/6826763_499x360.png" alt="one, two, three - check the microphone ..."><br><br>  In a few minutes everything is ready and checked. <br><br><img src="http://www.picamatic.com/show/2010/04/25/04/54/6826756_619x445.png" alt="the patient is more alive than dead"><br><br>  It remains only to check it in combat conditions.  Dexterity of hands - we take the charge of Nokia ... and we make of it the charge for GlobalSat.  Works!  A yellow LED indicates this.  I will check the car part as soon as I find the car. <br><img src="http://www.picamatic.com/show/2010/04/25/04/55/6826776_474x281.png" alt="works!">  . <br><br>  It was in such an uncomplicated way that I solved my problem - $ 5 in money, 2 hours in time (this is the sum with the purchase of connectors / solder / rosin).  Moreover, now there are plans to unify the rest of the chargers among themselves (those with similar charging currents) - this will help when you need to recharge two gadgets away from home - you can take with you only one charger and a set of removable connectors.  Also K.O.  suggests that if you bring 5V from the power supply unit to the front panel jack jack on the computer, you can charge the phone without departing from the workplace (most importantly, do not insert the microphone / headphones there :)).  And now I have a car charger for Nokia (potentially - and for other phones: a charging current of 2A is claimed - I think that's enough for everyone). <br><br>  <b>Upd.</b>  In the comments, a righteous dispute arose - and what will happen if you use car charging with a current of 2A to charge Nokia, which asks for 890mA.  Due to the lack of circuits for both, it was decided to conduct field trials.  The scheme is as follows: we add a variable resistor, an ammeter to the circuit and measure the whole thing. <br><img src="http://www.picamatic.com/show/2010/04/27/07/04/6852856_421x247.png" alt="You do not know Ohm's law - stay at home!"><br>  <b>Upd.</b>  <b>2</b> Following the advice of <a href="http://geektimes.ru/users/youhim/" class="user_link">YouHim, we</a> will fulfill <s>almost</s> all of the safety rules described in <a href="http://io.ua/s9449">this article</a> :) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/92000/">https://habr.com/ru/post/92000/</a></p>
