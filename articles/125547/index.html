  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Guerrilla marketing - your weapon in social networks</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  In the last century, guerrilla marketing was a secret sealed off.  Few knew about him, and even they kept their mouths shut, so that not a single competitor could get this powerful weapon.  Only some time later, in 1984, the founder of guerrilla marketing, Jay Conrad Levinson, shared his experience with a wide audience in a book that was called ‚ÄúGuerrilla Marketing‚Äù. <br><br>  And now offline you can regularly see actions carried out by large companies: here in the hardware store for discounts a joyful crowd is bursting in red T-shirts, while a pretty girl is waving flyers at the subway - how can one not go to this and take a brochure?  And in this supermarket there is a free chocolate tasting - you have to look in! <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/230/18f/35c/23018f35c22d6f1d1670f4317295c445.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Another fact: we are involved in the guerrilla war not only in real life, but also in the virtual one.  You asked for advice on the forum, which laptop to choose for your girlfriend, and now dozens of different opinions have an impact on your mind.  Take a closer look: maybe the representative of some company disguised as a member of the forum may be "processing" you right now.  Can not see?  That's why he and partisan marketing!

    <h5>  Guerrilla marketing online </h5><br><br>  But what prevents us, owners of our own companies, online stores, websites, blogs from using these weapons for their own benefit?  Nothing! <br>  As said L.N.  Tolstoy "Take ready and go further." <br><br>  Guerrilla marketing is an ideal means of advancement for resources that do not have a large budget for large-scale advertising campaigns.  It does not require large investments, but it is extremely effective. <br><br>  Guerrilla marketing involves the impact on the target audience in large quantities, locally or to the point in order to attract attention and instill confidence in the promoted product or company.  And where, how can I find your target audience on the Internet? <br><br>  The most tasty morsel for marketing partisans are social networks.  After all, it is easier here to select people by place of residence, age, education, interests and beliefs. <br><br><h5>  How to partisan in social networks? </h5><br><br>  Social networks are different: a common format (Vkontakte, Odnoklassniki, Facebook), professional (hello, Habr!), By interests (for example, Last.fm, MyAnimeList, FlyLady).  Naturally, it is better to search for clients and visitors in highly specialized networks or in groups of networks of a common format. <br><br>  Communicative features of social networks allow you to establish direct contact with a potential client - this is a huge plus for effective marketing work. <br><br>  If you want to be partisan in a social network, first you need to believably fill out a user profile and live his life: make friends, install some applications on the page, upload pictures, and only then you can join subject groups and participate in discussions.  The main thing is to communicate naturally and unobtrusively.  All this time, you need to continue to expand the circle of friends of interest. <br><br>  Daily monitoring, participation in the life of groups and communities, awareness of ongoing discussions is the key to the success of the campaign.  You saw that a person asks for advice on the choice of goods, or two people argue among themselves, figuring out which product is better?  So it's high time to use heavy artillery - <b>your personal opinion</b> .  In private opinion, a person will believe much more willingly than advertising on TV or a custom article on a magazine spread.  Such is our psychology. <br><br>  In addition, your dialogue (or discussion) will remain on the Internet for a long time and more than a dozen users will view it. <br><br><h5>  More options </h5><br><br>  You can go a more radical way - just buy recommendations and positive feedback on special resources.  In this case, you will not have to promote a non-existent user and spend a lot of time tracking comments.  And you can completely charge an advertising campaign to a special agency and not to bathe, but you will have to pay a decent amount for it. <br><br>  <i>Personally, I think that it is better to do it yourself or to entrust a specially trained employee of your company.</i>  <i>So you can be sure of the quality of the work done and keep your finger on the pulse.</i> <br><br>  Of course, the guerrilla war on social networks should go silently, carefully and inventively. <br><br>  <b>In this case, success is simply inevitable.</b> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/125547/">https://habr.com/ru/post/125547/</a></p>
