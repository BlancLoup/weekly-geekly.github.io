      <b>Current place of work:</b> <br>  CROC <br><br>  <b>Education:</b> <br>  MGTU them.  N.E.  Bauman <br><br>  <b>One word that best describes how you work:</b> <br>  Thoughtfully <br><br>  <b>How many hours a day do you work?</b> <br>  On weekdays I try not to count, on weekends I devote maximum time to family and children. <br><br>  <b>Current mobile device:</b> <br>  HTC One M8 <br><br>  <b>Current computer:</b> <br>  At work, a relatively commonplace, but powerful "hardware" - a workstation and a laptop.  At home - Intel NUC 5i7 is an amazingly productive thing for such a small box screwed to the back of the monitor. <br><br>  <b>Without any applications, programs, utilities you can not live?</b> <br>  Visual Studio, Spring Tool Suite - there are no former developers. <br><br>  <b>Which life hack helps you save time?</b> <br>  I practically do not use messengers.  Sometimes it is worth while for a short time to minimize mail, turn off alerts.  This practice works especially well in the morning ‚Äúuntil it has begun‚Äù and in the evening ‚Äúwhen it is already over‚Äù.  In the daytime, it‚Äôs not so easy to be in a ‚Äúflow state.‚Äù <br><br>  <b>What kind of to-do manager do you use?</b> <br>  Only Outlook and Evernote. <br><br>  <b>What do you listen when you work?</b> <br>  Rather, "whom."  Colleagues, customers, partners.  When solving a problem does not involve communication, it is most effective for me to work in silence, if possible.  It is good that the company has no open space in their classic sense. <br><br>  <b>What are you reading now?</b> <br>  "Brain.  Quick Guide.  Quite often we exchange literature at work, and this book was presented to me by a colleague.  It is curious to read an unusual pair of authors - a neurologist and a business consultant. <br><br>  <b>Which book from the last read was remembered the most?</b> <br>  From the last read - Going Postal (Terry Pratchett), I like good English humor.  If you take a deeper retrospective - ‚ÄúBusiness in the style of funk‚Äù Kjell A. Nordstrom and Jonas Ridderstrale.  Inspiring to think outside the box.  Quite a famous book, translated into 30 languages ‚Äã‚Äãof the world.  Last year, the authors came to the IT Leader Forum. <br><br>  <b>Do you use e-readers or prefer paper books?</b> <br>  I prefer the book to be interesting, the media can be anything. <br><br>  <b>How long do you sleep?</b> <br>  For me, a comfortable time to sleep is 7 hours. <br><br>  <b>Are you an owl or a lark?</b> <br>  It is comfortable for me to periodically change the role of the lark and owls.  It does not affect my performance.  Introduces a variety of life rhythm. <br><br>  <b>How do you have breakfast?</b> <br>  I try to have breakfast with my family, a pity, it does not always come out. <br><br>  <b>How do you spend your time on the way to work / from work?</b> <br>  I listen to podcasts in the car, as an incorrigible motorist. <br><br>  <b>What advice you have ever been given can you convey to others?</b> <br>  At one time, at the dawn of my career, I was advised to be more human.  Sometimes you want to pass this advice to others. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/296148/">https://habr.com/ru/post/296148/</a></p>
