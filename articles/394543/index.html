  <section class="page js-page"><h1>When size matters: Mi Max and other XIAOMI news</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Hi, Giktayms!  Rumors of updates from the company XIAOMI went long before the official presentation of new devices, which took place on 10 May.  The headliner of the event, of course, was the new XIAOMI Mi Max smartphone - we saw the first photos already in mid-April, but leaks should always be wary.  Well, now the new product is presented and will soon appear in Gearbest along with other equally interesting new gadgets from XIAOMI. <br><br>  For this reason, we decided not only to tell you about Mi Max in more detail, but also to make a useful selection of accessories, including those that are not yet on sale, because they will be a pleasant addition to the smartphone (and not only to it, to what a cunning). <br><br> <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/gearbest/blog/276294/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/dfc/5ba/e51/dfc5bae514f18d08d7c9f4daaabe475b.jpg"></a> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  XIAOMI Mi Max and a display worth seeing </h2><br>  Perhaps, someone will see the features of Redmi Note 3 here and be right: XIAOMI has really briefly gone from its flagship Mi5 towards the Redmi line and successfully expanded it.  Unlike the Mi5, the back panel of the smartphone is made of aluminum, although it didn‚Äôt do without plastic inserts on the sides - perhaps it only shows that this is still a budget device.  But in appearance and can not be said!

All this is protected by Gorilla Glass 4 glass. The processor is a six-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 650 or an eight-core Snapdragon 652 (four Cortex-A72 cores with 1.8 GHz and four Cortex-A52 cores with 1.4 GHz) with the Adreno 510 graphics accelerator. It is 652 The -th is used in the version with 128 GB of internal memory. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/60d/fd4/ee6/60dfd4ee6f0ce0ed4cd416f087d9be8b.jpg"><br><br>  In the top version, 4 GB of RAM is a nice addition.  The microSD slot has not gone away, but it is still used instead of the second SIM card.  The interfaces here are a complete set: Wi-Fi (ac / b / g / n) Dual-Band, 3.5 mm, microUSB, Bluetooth 4.2 LE, and even infrared.  Well, it is impossible not to note the support of the Quick Charge 3.0 fast charge function and the presence of a fingerprint scanner. <br><br>  The camera is very good - 16 megapixels cf / 2.0 with phase focusing, autofocus and video recording in 1080p resolution.  Frontal boasts a wide angle shooting with a resolution of 5 megapixels.  The 4850 mAh battery allows you to view online video for more than 13 hours.  XIAOMI Mi Max is running Android 6.0 Marshmallow with a new proprietary interface MIUI 8. Dimensions of the new product - 173.1 mm x 88.3 mm x 7.5 mm. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/2e2/f2c/fbd/2e2f2cfbd260b64da16f6d825b1af5c3.jpg"><br><br>  This is the first smartphone from XIAOMI with MIUI 8 on board.  In the new version of MIUI, we see an even more neat interface and additional features - optimization of the image viewing system, an advanced scanner, an updated application ‚ÄúNotes‚Äù with password protection, a new dynamic view of the notification curtain, and much more. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/f5b/c67/526/f5bc675260aec4a85cd7ecf877648dba.jpg"><br><br>  But the most important news - the version of <a href="http://www.gearbest.com/mobile-phones/pp_360560.html%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_medium%3Dyulia%26utm_campaign%3Dg16">Xiaomi Mi Max with 128 GB of internal memory is</a> already available for pre-order in GearBest!  A coupon MAXY will make the price 5% lower.  You can choose a new product in gold or light gray. <br><br><h2>  XIAOMI Yi II - a decent answer GoPro 4 </h2><br>  Why don't we make GoPro Hero 4 otvetochka?  Probably it was about this that XIAOMI thought about when they decided to launch a new action camera Yi 2. The Ambarella A9SE95 chip (against Go9 Hero 4 Black versus A9) is responsible for its speed.  They have the same sensor - a 12-megapixel Sony IMX377.  A 2.19-inch touchscreen with 330 ppi and support for recording 4K video at 30 fps (right up to 110 minutes) makes this camera a serious threat to GoPro. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/4ae/61c/8f8/4ae61c8f8582ffaef5809b4ad6731722.jpg"></div><br>  XIAOMI Yi 2 is also equipped with a microSD card slot and a 1400 mAh battery (removable, by the way), of course, it also didn't work without Wi-Fi and Bluetooth.  Vertical orientation became available for the body, while the camera itself remained very compact. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/a3b/ed8/de3/a3bed8de34e4fa34e1b422825dfd67a4.jpg"></div><br>  XIAOMI claims support for electronic image stabilization, and this really makes sense - just look at the comparison of the camera with GoPro Hero 4. In many ways, including the smoothness of the video sequence, Yi 4K, as it is also called, bypasses its main competitor. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/q0oyGL4SNVM" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  Great emphasis is placed on such characteristics as the diaphragm (2.8) and the maximum viewing angle of optics, which is 155 degrees.  Declare that the quality of the recorded sound in the new action camera from XIAOMI at a decent level. <br><br>  Yes, the characteristics are impressive - quick start for three seconds, double microphone, and stabilization, stabilization, stabilization!  Although sales of <a href="http://www.gearbest.com/action-cameras/pp_360137.html%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_medium%3Dyulia%26utm_campaign%3Dg16">XIAOMI Yi 2</a> started only on May 13, it is already possible to pre-order models in black and white in GearBest.  In secret - if you use the GBXiaoyi2 promo code, the price of your camera will be even lower. <br><br><h2>  XIAOMI Yi 1080P Car WiFi DVR - and the Chelyabinsk meteorite will shoot </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/57c/960/1f2/57c9601f27667b23744cb2cf05afa112.jpg"><br><br>  Everyone was waiting for XIAOMI to release its DVR that they did not specifically buy other devices - $ 60 for a ready-made solution with the ability to record video in Full HD 60 fps sounds very tasty.  Let's see why the XIAOMI Yi recorder is so good and why it is worth paying attention to. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/851/594/910/851594910efa82a5b2e0df60d97347cf.jpg"></div><br>  First of all, it is worth noting the support of night shooting, and a rather high-quality one, thanks to a high resolution lens with a f / 1.8 aperture and a photosensitive matrix.  Therefore, this DVR works even in low light conditions, and a wide viewing angle (165 degrees) allows you to capture all the events that occur with the car, since it covers three lanes at once.  Of course, there is no way out of the blind zones, but there will be much less of them here.  There are a lot of videos on YouTube, where users post videos from XIAOMI Yi at night, here's one of them: <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QCOGyJ690Dw" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  Also an important factor is the support of the smart system ADAS.  This is a real gift for car enthusiasts - the DVR detects the deviation of the car from the marking line in real time, controls the distance between your vehicle and other road users, and warns you in case of dangerous situations.  If the crash could not be avoided, a special sensor will record the force of impact. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/ba6/add/5a3/ba6add5a3e0529448e4c9d3b99b63652.jpg"></div><br>  The device is equipped with a 2.7-inch LCD display (16: 9, 426x240), has an integrated Wi-Fi 2.4G wireless module and an ultra-high resolution of 1296p UHD (30 fps).  Wi-Fi support allows you to view videos using the application in real time and earlier recordings. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/170/880/45a/17088045a8f584861ca642910081723f.jpg"></div><br>  What is iron?  All this is controlled by a dual-core A12 chip (40 nm), which works in symbiosis with the 4.0 V Lux-sec light sensor.  Aptina Ar0230 with a dynamic interval is used as an image sensor.  The lens consists of six optical lenses and is equipped with an infrared light filter. <br><br>  The case is painted with high-quality varnish, which causes pleasant tactile sensations.  The control of the DVR is carried out by four function buttons.  It is noteworthy that the recording is not interrupted even after filling the memory card (microSD up to 64 GB is supported), the recorder automatically deletes old entries to free up space.  Micro USB is used for power supply, the recorder itself is fixed with the help of suction cups on the glass. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/466/b76/696/466b76696bb6963eaefe97980568b53a.jpg"></div><br>  XIAOMI Yi 1080P Car Wi-Fi is available at GearBest - <a href="http://www.gearbest.com/car-dvr/pp_268947.html%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_medium%3Dyulia%26utm_campaign%3Dg16">you can</a> buy <a href="http://www.gearbest.com/car-dvr/pp_268947.html%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_medium%3Dyulia%26utm_campaign%3Dg16">it here</a> (by the way, as long as there is a good discount). <br><br>  By the way, the user <a href="https://geektimes.ru/users/boomburum/" class="user_link">Boomburum</a> just made a <a href="http://boomburum.ru/reviews/xiaomi-yi-car-dvr-review">review of</a> this DVR in his blog. <br><br><h2>  XIAOMI Mi Bluetooth 4.0 Speaker - there is not much sound </h2><br>  The XIAOMI family of portable speakers has been replenished with a new member: the company decided not to limit itself to a rectangular speaker and also released a portable speaker Mi Bluetooth 4.0 Speaker in a round compact case. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/92b/7ee/d45/92b7eed4593f828422870ffbaf07dac0.jpg"><br><br>  In this "baby" is hidden one speaker, but what a!  Whole 2W - the sound is not only loud, but also high quality.  XIAOMI even managed, not afraid of this word, to push the CVC 6.0 noise cancellation system there.  Support for Bluetooth 4.0 with a range of up to five meters and a built-in microphone is included.  But the main thing is portability: at a party, in the office, on a bicycle or a hoverboard, at home on the balcony ... you can use it anywhere. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/7fb/619/e17/7fb619e17c9476b3c3708dc95c4b6015.jpg"><br><br>  The case is made of aluminum, is charged using micro-USB.  By the way, about the battery life - 4 hours in listening mode will easily give you (300 mAh battery), there is also a fast charge function. <br><br>  The speaker has a rather large volume reserve, it does not wheeze and does not distort the sound even at the maximum.  XIAOMI used the potential of such a miniature package to the fullest, except that there is no subwoofer.  Of the competitors can be identified JBL Clip +, but this is a completely different price segment.  Available in black, gray and gold. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/291/d32/0a9/291d320a9dd6d68ef5d98ae2398684a5.jpg"><br><br>  The Mi Bluetooth 4.0 Speaker column works with both Android devices (in combination with XIAOMI, Mi Max will be hot in general) and with iOS gadgets.  You <a href="http://www.gearbest.com/speakers/pp_352950.html%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_medium%3Dyulia%26utm_campaign%3Dg16">can</a> already <a href="http://www.gearbest.com/speakers/pp_352950.html%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_medium%3Dyulia%26utm_campaign%3Dg16">buy</a> (not pre-order, namely buy) in GearBest. <br><br>  This is not all new items from XIAOMI, we will tell you about the rest too, but a little later! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/394543/">https://habr.com/ru/post/394543/</a></p>
