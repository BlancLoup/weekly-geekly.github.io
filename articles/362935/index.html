In particular, the <a href="http://izvestia.ru/news/575237">words of</a> Izvestia were cited, that part of the stores were working with multi-billion dollar losses, the bankruptcy of the White Wind was recalled and the assumption was made that new bankruptcies would soon follow. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/04a/e40/b9a/04ae40b9a73d433f876c60282c822696.jpg"><br><br>  The prediction was not long in coming - at the beginning of this week it was reported that one of Svyaznoy's creditors, a firm belonging to the Onexim group, had declared a default, i.e.  situations when the borrower of credit funds could not fulfill the obligation to repay the debt.  The mortgage on the loan was a controlling stake in a Cypriot company managing the assets of Svyaznoy.  Well, yesterday it became <a href="http://www.vedomosti.ru/tech/news/35903491/oneksim-i-npf-blagosostoyanie-stali-vladelcami-90-svyaznogo">known</a> that Onexim and NPF ‚ÄúProsperity‚Äù became the owners of 90% of the Svyaznoy Group of Companies.  Those.  Svyaznoy for the debts changed the owner. <a name="habracut"></a>

      Svyaznoy Group of Companies includes several companies.  For example, salons of communication and Enter.ru online store.  Interestingly, according <a href="http://izvestia.ru/news/575237">to</a> the same Izvestia, Enter ended last year with a loss of 4 billion rubles, the year before last - with a loss of 1.8 billion.  In total, Svyaznoy Group of Companies, according to <a href="http://www.kommersant.ru/doc/2607229">unofficial data from</a> Kommersant, owed creditors about 560 million dollars (at the current exchange rate it is almost 26 billion rubles). <br><br>  Interestingly, a day before the announcement of the purchase of a 90% stake in Svyaznoy <a href="https://twitter.com/eldarmurtazin/status/531793422034956288/photo/1">, the</a> statement of GK Svyaznoy director Michael Tach was <a href="https://twitter.com/eldarmurtazin/status/531793422034956288/photo/1">distributed</a> on the network, saying that Svyaznoy is OK.  True, it was only about the Svyaznoy retail block (stores) and the director said that this part generates revenue and profit on its own, and that the amount of net debt in 2014 was reduced relative to the previous period.  However, everything ended as it ended - the Svyaznoy Group of Companies changed owners. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/052/0b5/da5/0520b5da54eb47a0b9a071695dc216f4.jpg"><br><br>  It is necessary to understand that business will not end on one Connected.  2014 was very difficult for sellers.  Hope for big sales on the New Year, as a rule, compensating for losses in the summer months, may not come true because of the high dollar rate.  So far, official suppliers keep fixed prices in rubles (which is why the same iPhones have become the cheapest in Europe), but will not be able to continue for a long time.  Yes, and this situation is unlikely to spread to new models. <br><br>  In connection with the foregoing, I would not yet rely on large pre-New Year discounts in domestic stores.  Given the dollar exchange rate and the freezing of ruble price tags, current prices in relation to the European look already at a discount.  It is easier for the seller to sell the equipment at the old price, than to reduce the cost, to deposit money and buy new lots.  Because new lots will be more expensive. <br><br>  In addition, I would like to once again remind you that the budget for 2015-2017 laid the income from the duties on parcels from abroad and you can expect them to be introduced starting in January 2015.  Judging by the position of domestic sellers, many of them will not survive without these duties. <br><br>  Anticipating comments in the spirit of "and it was not necessary to be greedy," I want to cite the words of the user <a href="http://geektimes.ru/users/lolhunter/" class="user_link">Lolhunter</a> from the topic about <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/madrobots/blog/240887/">Pebble watches</a> .  Comments are taken without changes and edits. <br><br>  First question: <br><blockquote>  ‚ÄúHonestly, I already look at many gadgets in your store.  But always scares, oddly enough, the price.  The same Pebble Steele.  $ 200 abroad.  And 12,000 rubles (without discount) in Russia.  Yes, the dollar went up, yes, the delivery is worth something.  But the difference of $ 100 dollars is still scary.  But still decided to buy, now waiting for delivery :-) " </blockquote><br>  And the answer is: <br><blockquote>  ‚ÄúI am always saddened by the lack of awareness of our people.  Everyone thinks that we have high prices because in Russia there are greedy sellers. <br>  In addition to delivery, there are a lot of cool payments. <br>  Here's how everything happens: <br>  Pebble there cost $ 200.  For dealers discount of, say, 30%.  Total 140. <br>  Let's start with the payment.  In order not to be a participant in foreign economic activity (it costs an individual accountant + a ton of gimor), we pay the broker.  It is worth + 4-5% to the Central Bank.  Let it be 5 for even counting.  Total 147 <br>  We took them to Russia.  Since the product is small and light, and our money is expensive (20% per annum minimum. Yield less than this number does not make sense - it‚Äôs easier to sell a store, buy property and don‚Äôt bother with the word at all), we carry air. <br>  Let's say the air will come out 8 bucks per kilo or 4 bucks per piece (godly). <br>  $ 151 <br>  Further customs. <br>  VAT 18% price is $ 178.18 <br>  Customs clearance. <br>  From $ 2000 per lot.  If a batch of 500 pieces + $ 4 <br>  $ 182.18 <br>  Now let's talk about the surcharge.  For some reason, it is believed that the Russian store should work with some other markup than a foreign one.  For them, there is a 30% discount, which is a premium of 1,428 for the purchase.  And if this is an American store, then it orders from the supplier and has the goods in two days.  We need to collect the batch and we will receive the goods in two weeks, so it‚Äôs fair to have a large margin due to the cost of money and delivery time.  Also in Russia (for reference) roughly 18% VAT is paid from the extra charge (you can accept VAT paid for offset, but not all expenses are subject to VAT, for example, wages cannot be accepted).  In the US, there is no VAT, sales tax is paid on the website.  So let's add roughly 10% to the markup.  Total mark-up 1.6 with this mark-up, we will be in more or less equal conditions with stores in the United States. <br>  We give the same markup to us. <br>  Output price <br>  291.49, which at the current rate of 41 = 11951.01. <br>  In!  Almost guessed :)" </blockquote><br>  As you can see, the majority of domestic stores simply do not have the opportunity to lower prices, unless they do it at a loss.  But Amazon and BestBuy are already dropping dollar prices on the eve of <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/shopozzcom/blog/242357/">Black Friday</a> .  In fairness, I must say that Amazon also fixes huge losses, but at least their prices do not depend on the course. <br><br>  I remind you that you read the blog of the company Shopozz, a free Mail Forwarding service from the USA.  Shopozz with pleasure, at a low price and in guaranteed time will deliver anything from the United States and other countries.
