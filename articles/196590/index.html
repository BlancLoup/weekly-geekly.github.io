In my opinion, this is a great idea, creative and cool.  But something I did not like.  And now you‚Äôll learn 5 reasons why Phonebloks probably won‚Äôt work. <br><br><h5>  5. It's disgusting </h5><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b40/5e3/eb5/b405e3eb541f7e6497efeb42c5148a5a.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Whatever you say about the internal specifications of the IPhone, but it looks great.  And this is a major factor for consumers to base their decisions on aesthetics.  Ask any designer, whether it's clothing, web design or landscape, aesthetics are of great importance when designing a phone.

      Phonebloks doesn't have that.  Perhaps if there were more designers in the project from the very beginning, then the design would have not such a strictly rectangular shape.  Remember, this is not yet a finished product, and not a prototype, it is for now only an idea in your head.  And it can still be changed.  What we saw on YouTube showed only the concept of Phonebloks, but not Phonebloks as such. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h5>  4. The motherboard will wear out </h5><br>  On the operation of the device, you will need a very durable board, since the constant replacement of parts in the chain will wear it. <br>  The advantage of this system is that the board can be easily replaced; however, the same problem arises, these parts will wear out even faster than the filling of a regular phone. <br><br><h5>  3. Updating would create even more damages. </h5><br>  What happens when technology gets newer?  New processor, video card, battery, WiFi standard, etc.  Everything will change, and not everything will be compatible with the main, main Phonebloks board.  In fact, you will probably have to update your phone again and again, whether it is a part of the purchase amount, or a single amount at once.  This is contrary to the goal of Phonebloks, aimed at reducing electronics waste, but it can happen to the same thing (if not worse). <br><br>  For example, I bought a computer.  Then I gradually change some parts of this computer, due to the release of new hardware and software stuffing.  What does it mean?  This means that I spend the amount on one computer, like 3-4 computers.  Sometimes I donate outdated parts for recycling, either I insert them into other computers in my house, or I keep them as spare parts to fix my computers, or the computers of my friends.  However, if you thought that continuously updating your computers, you save the environment, you are mistaken.  It simply means that I buy the entire computer (and parts for it) for a year, and not buy a new computer every couple of years.  This could be a danger to Phonebloks.  When parts are updated, when you want new ones, rather than every two years when the contract expires, you may create more loss. <br><br><h5>  2. Compatibility </h5><br>  Many people complain about the Android ecosystem fracture: Not all versions of Android are compatible with all phones, not all applications are compatible with all versions of Android, or all devices, not all applications work like on phones and tablets, some applications look terrible, while some look perfect.  This is a mess, and I say this as an Android user.  Fragmentation occurs clean and simple, manufacturers are too lazy to make the latest software work on older devices. <br><br><h5>  1. Production </h5><br>  Have you ever wondered why manufacturers choose only basic models for production?  Because most factories are designed to produce hundreds of thousands of copies of the same phone.  Of course, the production of hundreds of thousands of individual components will not differ greatly from the production of each individual component (battery, storage, camera, etc.). <br>  Then there should be several versions of the phone, for the "true" settings.  And if several partners are involved, and there will be various partners with a different model, and then suddenly the question arises of introducing components that will work in each model. <br><br><h4>  Verdict: Hardly </h4><br>  Honestly, I would like it to work.  However, at the moment in history, it is unlikely to be accepted by manufacturers.  Of course, we can hope, but we should always approach things with a small amount of realism. <br><br>  Your thoughts? <br><br>  <a href="http://whatculture.com/technology/5-reasons-why-phonebloks-probably-wont-work.php">Original article</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/196590/">https://habr.com/ru/post/196590/</a></p>
