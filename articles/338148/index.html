Totolli simultaneously presents two ‚Äúbreakthrough‚Äù technologies: eSIM based on GSM mobile phones, as well as a Multi-IMSI M2M (multi-profile) platform with the ability to connect profiles (IMSI + Ki bundle) to any supporting mobile operators. <br><br>  At the moment, Multi-IMSI + eSIM contains global profiles of three operators, allowing devices to register in cellular networks around the world.  If necessary, it is possible to expand the pool of submitted profiles to 16 and more. <br><br>  The symbiosis of Multi Sim and eSIM technologies is based on Micromax and Nokia device models.  Assembling, testing and commercial implementation of customized devices are produced by our partner Non-SIM Technology.

      In this article we will continue <a name="habracut"></a>  talk about Tottolli products adapted for B2B clients and now consider technological solutions for Companies using M2M technology in their business. <br><br><h3>  <font color="#0071BC">Implementation of eSim in M2M</font> </h3><br>  M2M penetration in Russia today occurs in all spheres and the number of M2M devices is steadily increasing.  The issue of remote control of these devices and the need for a convenient tool for this are all the more urgent: M2M platforms.  M2M platform is a system for managing devices, which include SIM cards and eSIM. <br><br>  It allows you to remotely monitor the status of SIM cards, set a tariff, set notification rules for events, receive reports and create various levels of access for employees.  Wherever sensors with SIM cards are used, remote control and monitoring is necessary. <br><br>  Principle of operation: the client installs eSim into the equipment and, via the interface, gets the ability to remotely configure, manage and monitor the status of SIM cards and sensors. <br><br><h4>  <font color="#0071BC">Here are the main areas of use of M2M devices:</font> </h4><br>  ÔÇß ATMs, POS-terminals, including Near Field Communication (NFC) - contactless payments, trading and payment terminals <br>  ÔÇß Sensors in the housing and utilities system or production, measuring liquid / gas flow, temperature, and other parameters) <br>  ÔÇß Monitoring of mobile objects (tracking the location of the car / taxi / truck, its condition and communication with the driver), security and anti-theft systems, <br>  ÔÇß Consumer electronics (navigators, trackers, household appliances) <br>  ÔÇß M2M devices in medical equipment <br><br><h4>  <font color="#0071BC">Therefore, the main tasks relevant to M2M customers are:</font> </h4><br>  ÔÇß Real-time eSIM status indication <br>  ÔÇß Prompt change of chip status <br>  Powerful reporting and analytics <br>  The need for regular (daily) processing of information about the work of a huge number of M2M devices <br>  ÔÇß Significant cost optimization <br><br>  All these issues are decided by the M2M platform, which many telecom operators and integrators are now ready to offer. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/3b8/b2f/ad2/3b8b2fad2f3b4d9cb2d67be83e8b8e46.png"><br><h3>  <font color="#0071BC">Roaming costs for M2M devices</font> </h3><br>  Another no less relevant issue concerns the cost of finance roaming.  This is a really serious question that raises the cost of communication in the tens and sometimes hundreds of times! <br><br>  M2M devices are often characterized by mobility.  This, of course, is motor transport, together with telemetry and navigation equipment attached to it, as well as some mobile payment terminals spend much more funds of the Client, especially if they move in international roaming.  It is so financially costly that many Clients prefer to block M2M chips for the time they visit roaming, allowing the equipment to accumulate information and transmit it already upon arrival in Russia.  Of course, the M2M platform can automatically block the cards, but using the ‚Äúblack box‚Äù when the Client does not know anything about the data from the SIM card can sometimes significantly harm the business and creates additional problems. <br><br>  Tottoli proposes to solve this problem in the most optimal way: using MultiSim M2M Sim-chips (Multi eSIM).  Today it is the most modern, convenient, practical solution for M2M devices in roaming.  The solution is a special Multi eSIM with a special SIM applet, which, on the command of an M2M platform, activates different IMSIs within one eSIM. <br><br>  The same Multi eSim worldwide works with local tariffs at minimal prices. <br><br><h3>  <font color="#0071BC">New financial interaction model</font> </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/31f/b25/809/31fb25809a2c46f0b6aa2bafd0e922f3.png"><br>  And finally, I would like to talk about the new financial scheme, which has long been in demand in the market and is especially interesting for those companies that are just starting to work in the M2M market and are not ready for serious financial investments to work directly with large Operators. <br><br>  Typically, Clients are invited to work directly with the Telecom Operator, that is, only the Telecom Operator manages your balance, assigning unprofitable tariffs to small businesses and arguing that your company still brings a little revenue, promising to reduce tariffs in the future when the business grows and you have the need to buy SIM cards in tens or hundreds of thousands.  Of course, this is a serious stop factor for business development with small volumes, and such a business scheme often even stops new projects if it is not possible to immediately invest large finances. <br><br>  We propose a different financial scheme for using the M2M platform, in which the manufacturer takes on mutual settlements with subscribers and the operator (in the role of Tottoli), and managing the subscriber balance (that is, billing).  Thus, the manufacturer has the opportunity to independently form tariff plans depending on the market situation, and he also has a serious financial ‚Äúpillow‚Äù in the form of subscriber balances for business development. <br><br><h3>  <font color="#0071BC">Summary</font> </h3><br>  The above thought out converged solutions and technologies from Totolli, from our point of view, will allow Clients to solve their difficult business problems using our simple and easy-to-use solutions, while working in almost all mobile networks around the world just as in the home network, getting voice and data services at the best prices. <br><br>  We are also confident that our approach to the financial scheme of interaction with Totolli and our tariff plans will be of interest to those Companies that are interested in immediately obtaining ready-made solutions at favorable rates, without significant capital investments. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/338148/">https://habr.com/ru/post/338148/</a></p>
