  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Crowdsourcing clears congestion in Moscow?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Recently, a wide discussion has unfolded around the expansion of the Moscow Ring Road and other ways to eliminate traffic jams in Moscow.  As is known, road construction engineers were critical of Luzhkov‚Äôs proposal to expand the Moscow Ring Road to 16 lanes.  They say that it is much more efficient to conduct "point" events: to build additional congresses and junctions, and also to consider each situation separately.  This is exactly the kind of work that the <a href="http://proboknet.com/">Moscow Center for Fighting Traffic Jams</a> is doing - a public organization created by students.  Yesterday they launched their website, which is <a href="http://proboknet.com/Map/">receiving traffic jams</a> from the public. <br><br>  According to the initiators of the project, up to 60% of Moscow‚Äôs traffic jams can be eliminated with the help of simple measures, such as changing the mode of a traffic light, canceling a turn, creating an additional pocket, etc.  Motorists know this better than others.  On the site, they can fill out a form and send information on how to optimize traffic on a particular street. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  For example, at the proposal of the organization last year, the capacity of the Warsaw highway was increased by canceling the left turn onto Nagatinskaya Street by moving towards the region.  Instead, you can turn around the tunnel above the Kashirskoye Highway (rerun 900 m).  As a result, it was possible to eliminate the 3 km long traffic jam. <br><br>  The head of the organization, Alexander Shumsky, <a href="http://www.finamauto.ru/news/article05EEE/default.asp">held a press conference</a> yesterday and announced that they had already handed over up to 200 proposals to the Moscow authorities on eliminating regularly occurring traffic jams.  Proposals will be considered before the end of the year.

      Already implemented measures to change the scheme of traffic lights at the intersections of the Warsaw highway with the streets of Podolsk cadets, the first road passage, Sumy street, Balaklavsky Avenue, as well as the intersection of the street Podolsk cadets with Road street. <br><br>  Other proposed measures that have not yet been implemented include the creation of an additional pocket for turning right at the intersection of Varshavskoye Highway and Akademik Yangel Street, as well as filling the ‚Äúgap‚Äù (building a 160-meter road section) on Dorozhnaya Street, which duplicates Varshavskoe Highway. <br><br>  However, some experts call such a public initiative ‚Äúprofanation‚Äù.  In <a href="http://www.kommersant.ru/doc.aspx%3FDocsID%3D1376614">an interview with the newspaper Kommersant</a> , Mikhail Blinkin, scientific director of the Research Institute of Transport and Road Management, speaks: ‚ÄúOn the one hand, there are really 1,500 traffic lights in the city - and it‚Äôs not that they all work perfectly.  Therefore, you can probably find bloopers that you can just fix.  But it is impossible to assume that such methods can get rid of 80% of Moscow traffic jams.  It is like treating a disease with holy water alone.  All problem areas in Moscow are known to specialists.  What can a social movement add?  For a real assessment of [road congestion], there are special techniques, with measurements at different times of the day, on different days of the week.  Without such measurements, it is somewhat irresponsible to assert any success. ‚Äù <br><br>  According to Blinkin, a special suspicion is the fact that this public organization is supported by the Moscow authorities.  Of course, such ‚Äúholy water treatment‚Äù is much more profitable for the authorities than investing billions of dollars in the construction of the Fourth Ring Road. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/94801/">https://habr.com/ru/post/94801/</a></p>
