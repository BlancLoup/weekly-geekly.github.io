  <section class="page js-page"><h1>New HP Gen8 servers on AMD processors: DL385p, BL465p Gen8</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The eighth generation of HP server products, introduced in spring 2012, continues to be filled with new models.  Along with the familiar Intel processors, HP uses AMD and its processors in its servers, thereby giving its customers more freedom of choice. <br><br>  In the second half of August 2012, HP held a seminar in Moscow at which HP and Microsoft experts talked about new servers with AMD processors and the capabilities they offered. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/522/5f7/113/5225f711306b0f65826c5cc2cc4119e0.jpg"></div><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The AMD Opteron 6200 processor series includes the world's first 16-core processor, in which the company's engineers tried to find a balance of performance, scalability and efficiency.  The special features of the processor are the proprietary direct access memory technology Direct Connect Architecture and the number of cores increased by one third while maintaining the chip area, which has a beneficial effect on the power consumption of processor-based systems. <br>  The AMD Opteron 6200 and 4200 processors incorporate AMD Bulldozer technology, whose distinctive features are modular architecture, dynamic allocation of computing power (Flex FP), an upgraded memory controller and AMD Turbo Core performance enhancing technology.  As a result, a new family of processors received an increase in performance in the amount of up to 84%, a reduction in energy consumption of up to 46%, and support for several generations of platforms, providing unprecedented flexibility in choosing a platform for virtualization.

      Up to 70% of the global server market is occupied by dual-processor models, and AMD makes the highest bid for this segment (while not forgetting the rest, of course).  For the server chipset series SR 5600 processors are available with the number of cores from 4 to 16.  Processors with the largest number of cores are installed in systems with four and eight processors, focused on highly loaded computing, and for ‚Äúcombat‚Äù dual-processor systems, models for 4 and 8 cores are better suited. <br><br>  A recent addition was the HP ProLiant DL (Density Line) and BL (Blade Line) server lines.  The DL lineup includes rack servers of various sizes and performance.  And the BL line includes server blades installed in the c3000 and c7000 chassis. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/98b/9f4/4f1/98b9f44f1026c0cec3e14cb5f711dc27.jpg"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/d57/f11/a4c/d57f11a4caf830fd12058883cc8b54d5.jpg"><br><pre>  DL385p BL465c </pre><br>  In the DL lineup, the DL385p server was updated, which also existed in the 7th generation of ProLiant.  In this dual-unit server, you can install one or two AMD Opteron 6200 series processors. If necessary, the maximum number of cores per server can be brought up to 32 pieces when installing two 16-core processors.  However, in typical tasks, the use of 4- and 8-core processors can be more effective in terms of the price-performance ratio.  There are quite a few memory slots in the server - 24. Therefore, if you wish, you can install up to 768 GB of memory in the server.  Paired with the HP P2000 Series DSS from ProLiant DL385p, you can get a good thresher for small and medium-sized corporate databases.  At the same time, up to 12 large form factor (LFF) disks and up to 25 small (SFF) disks can be installed in the server itself.  Also, the DL385p can easily become part of a private cloud of a medium or large company.  For network connections in the DL385p one of the modules of the HP FlexibleLOM line is responsible - you can choose the network interface of your choice. <br><br>  With the update of the BL line and the release of new AMD processors, the ProLiant BL465c Gen8 server has received new components.  For example, the new HP SmartArray disk controller with a 6-gigabit SAS interface and significant performance gains compared to the controller in the seventh generation of servers (G7).  The server also received a new version of the remote management system iLO, the fourth, HP SmartMemory technology and common for the eighth generation servers Intelligent Provisioning technology, Active Health, Agentless Management and Sea of ‚Äã‚Äãsensors.  In terms of network interfaces, an update has also occurred; now the FlexFabric module can include both the usual two 10 Gigabit Ethernet ports and four additional Gigabit ports. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/ebd/cac/045/ebdcac0459526a90a43498755383996c.jpg"><br>  HP SmartArray <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/fc7/3b5/ccb/fc73b5ccbff333990922019f77957d2d.jpg"><br>  HP SmartMemory <br><br>  The new AMD processors are telling the eighth generation HP ProLiant servers the same new reading: they are now less expensive compared to similar Xeon-based configurations, often better suited for virtualization and cloud applications, and they also have more efficient tools for monitoring performance and power consumption. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/150614/">https://habr.com/ru/post/150614/</a></p>
