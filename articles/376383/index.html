  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How to train intelligence with games</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  ‚ÄúMom, this is for study,‚Äù we explained in childhood to parents who did not understand why they should buy the most expensive computer with the latest-generation 3D accelerator.  Parents (sometimes) agreed, and we diligently "studied" in Quake, Duke Nukem and Heroes of Might &amp; Magic. <br><br>  Video games and education are usually perceived as opposites.  Games mean entertainment, and learning is a serious and fun-free process.  There is no such contradiction in nature: young animals and young children learn to play.  The game is the most natural and effective way to learn. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d11/998/be8/d11998be8bc043688e84d93515a070f2.jpg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Many have tried to make video games useful, to use them for the education and development of the intellect, but few have succeeded well.  Best of all so far has turned out in services for the development of cognitive skills.  This genre appeared ten years ago thanks to the games Brain Training for Nindendo DS.  Brain Training has become <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_best-selling_video_game_franchises">one of the most popular episodes in the history of games</a> , but by the end of the decade, the release of new games had stopped, and Nintendo was replaced by browser games and mobile applications: Lumosity, Uplift.io, Elevate, Peak, Fit Brains, CogniFit.  Below is a story about the three most notable projects in this area today.

    <h5>  Lumosity </h5><br>  The largest and most famous among the services for training the brain.  Exists since 2007, attracted $ 67.5 million investment, more than 60 million people are registered.  There <a href="http://www.lumosity.com/">are</a> several dozen games on <a href="http://www.lumosity.com/">Lumosity</a> that are profiled in several directions: memory, speed of thinking, attentiveness, flexibility, calculations.  At the end of each session, points are added and percentiles are calculated that show how much better or worse you are from other users in your age group.  The games are simple, made in flash, and the fun varies from ‚Äúso-so‚Äù to ‚Äúvery exciting.‚Äù <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/640/fc7/01e/640fc701e1804b85bb9037962e2e8a95.png"><br><br>  In general, Lumosity leaves a positive impression, you can hang on it for several months.  Among the shortcomings - rustic graphics and the rare appearance of new games. <br><br><h5>  Uplift.io </h5><br>  The only significant Russian project in this area.  In terms of mechanics, <a href="http://uplift.io/">Uplift is</a> similar to Lumosity: pumping is based on five parameters (speed, memory, attentiveness, flexibility, computational skills), and a percentile system is used to compare users.  But Uplift is more gaming: there are ratings, achievements (like on the PlayStation and Xbox), and the graphics in games are brighter and do not resemble the medical sterility of Lumosity.  Another difference is the games that give subject knowledge: in English, geography, history.  The greatest interest is the game on the knowledge of countries and capitals.  A minus - while there is no mobile application (promise soon), plus - low cost in comparison with foreign analogues (one or two orders of magnitude). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e0b/a26/ce8/e0ba26ce8ced46daa108e6f1b2b27500.png"><br><br><h5>  Elevate </h5><br>  <a href="http://elevateapp.com/">Elevate</a> , unlike Lumosity and Uplift, exists only as a mobile application.  The program is declared as a simulator of concentration, oratorical abilities, speed of thinking, memory and mathematical skills.  The library of games is mainly represented not by logical puzzles, but by content games: search for synonyms, arithmetic, substitution of missing words, quick reading in English.  The interestingness of games, as elsewhere, varies, but the graphics in Elevate are very good. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/033/d6d/40c/033d6d40c44f49e4b9df17098fc56780.png"></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/376383/">https://habr.com/ru/post/376383/</a></p>
