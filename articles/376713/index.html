  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Art in artificial intelligence</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Questions of art are closely related to the psychology and perception of certain signals by a person, be it sound frequencies or color spectra.  In this regard, the question of creating an artificial intelligence system that deals with or synthesizes a work of art is an extremely difficult task that borders on impracticability, but this is not entirely true.  To create such a system, it is necessary to deeply study the physical and emotional perception of a person of various external factors.  This may seem like a rather simple task, considering that most of the perception issues have been studied in detail by experts in relevant fields of the scientific world.  But do not forget that our world is designed in such a way that by connecting two well-known elements, we get a third, not similar to any of the previous ones, a unique pattern that will behave quite differently than expected.  This confirms a simple school example from chemistry, when we add a drop of glycerin to potassium permanganate, after which the mixture ignites. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h1>  Painting </h1><br>  What happens when a person looks at a picture?  This is the main question, the answer to which will allow us to come closer to creating an artificial intelligence system that can write pictures. <br>  The first factor affecting the perception and mood of a person is the color gamut, or more precisely the color spectra.  In order to define the concept of color, wave theory is quite enough for us.  So, light is radiation with a specific wavelength.  The visible light spectrum is radiation with wavelengths in the range of approximately 400 to 700 nanometers.  All radiation outside this range is no longer perceived by the human eye. <br>  The second factor is simple images that complement the range.  Undoubtedly, if a person sees a painted apple, he will surely smell it and be able to feel its taste if he has tried this apple before. <br>  By the third factor, I single out complex images or ‚Äúpatterns‚Äù that a person has accumulated during life.  After all, it is impossible to deny that a person who well remembers the painting ‚ÄúGirl with Peaches‚Äù will certainly imagine this picture if he sees exactly the same peach as any other picture with similar images. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/add/79c/52e/add79c52ea105cefb19c28ffffab4f73.jpg" alt="image"><br>  I would like to clarify that a person evaluates material things and images in different ways.  Most likely, if he holds such a peach in his hand, he will not think about the painting. <br>  Let us consider in more detail the influence on the perception of a person of each of the three factors. <br><br><h2>  First factor </h2><br><h3>  How do we perceive colors </h3><br>  <b>Color</b> is a sensory impression that occurs when wave light stimuli of a certain length (electromagnetic radiation in the range of approximately 180 to 780 nm, the so-called light spectrum) fall on the pupil receptors.  From there, via neural networks, this impulse is transmitted to the brain and begins to be perceived as color.  The perception of the color of surrounding objects is always subjective, as it occurs only in the brain of the beholder.  In the physical sense, objects have no color, we just perceive them as such. <br>  The physiological aspect of color perception is that in the process of evolution photoreceptors appeared on the back of the human pupil.  When exposed to electromagnetic waves with a length of 380 to 780 nm, they are able to generate a physiological (nervous) signal.  There are two types of photoreceptors: rods and cones.  The rods only recognize the contrast of black and white, are very light-sensitive and make vision possible at dusk and in darkness.  Cones are responsible for color perception.  There are three types of cones that perceive short (blue), medium (green) and long waves (red) color radiation.  Each combination of light rays falling on the retina, in a certain way, excites these three types of cones and gives a corresponding impression of color.  Nerve impulses that occur on photoreceptors are transmitted through the nerve networks to the brain (transduction), where ultimately colors begin to be consciously perceived.

    <h3>  Color Psychology </h3><br>  Numerous psychological and sociological studies on this topic provide a generally uniform picture.  On the one hand, the emotional impact of colors is due to the properties of universal objects (blue sky, red blood, yellow sun, green grass, etc.), on the other hand - the influence of culture, and it does not matter whether we are aware of its influence or not.  In everyday life, not only painters, designers, graphic artists and other representatives of the art professions deal with the symbolism of flowers.  The emotional impact of colors is reflected, for example, in the language - the expressions ‚Äúlike a red rag for a bull‚Äù, ‚Äúpeople in white coats‚Äù, ‚Äúblacken with anger‚Äù and many others are familiar to everyone. <br><br><h4>  Description of the study </h4><br>  In the study of color perception by a group of scientists, two experiments were conducted.  In the first of these, subjects (10 men and 10 women) were shown differently colored slides and recorded neural activity in the perception of a particular color. <br>  In the second experiment, participants were shown 30 photos depicting loving couples kissing.  Among these photographs were both monochrome (painted in different colors - red, yellow, blue, green, black) and color.  Each shot appeared in six colors (in random order, for one second).  The subjects received instructions: ‚ÄúYou will be shown photos of kissing couples.  Some of the photos are portraits of ordinary people, and some are still from movies.  Please rate how, in your opinion, the feelings of the people in the photo are strong (on a scale from 1 to 5). ‚Äù <br>  During the experiment, we specifically asked to ‚Äúassess the feelings‚Äù of the people in the photographs so that the attention of the experiment participants was not directed either at the color or at their subjective attitude towards it.  It was investigated how different shades of colors affect the emotional evaluation of a particular photo. <br><br><h4>  Research results </h4><br><ul><li>  Color and transduction.  The process of transduction (‚Äútranslation‚Äù of a color stimulus into the language of the brain) in the perception of different colors takes an unequal amount of time and causes different intensity of neural activity in the corresponding areas of the brain, depending on what color is processed. <br>  Before the beginning of conscious perception (approximately 200-300 ms), green and blue cause stronger neural excitation in the frontal lobe of the brain than red.  Red, in turn, during the same time period activates neural activity in the occipital and temporal areas, indicating a strong emotional impact of this color.  It has been scientifically proven that the impulses of visual stimuli, passing through the occipital and temporal zones, immediately enter the limbic system (the location of emotions).  The loyalty of the saying ‚ÄúBlue is the color of reason, red is the color of passion‚Äù has now been proved from the point of view of neurophysiology. </li><li>  Colors and emotions.  The influence of colors on the emotional perception of the surrounding world is also explained by the fact that the peak of neural activity during color perception falls on 50-150 ms from the moment of the beginning of the stimulus influence (the period of subconscious perception).  Thus, colors have a tremendous impact on cognitive (consciously lived) processes, since during the period of their subconscious processing they cause a peak in neural activity. </li><li>  The impact of colors on conscious perception.  With conscious perception (which begins after 300 ms), the colors affect the neural activity in completely different ways.  In other words, the experience gained in the process of sociologization of the subject, as well as his individual color preferences, personal qualities and the structure of motivation have a very great influence on the perception of colors. <br>  Exposure to some colors causes similar reactions in different cultures.  So, the red color affects more intensely than blue and green, the bright contrasting combination of colors is stronger than the dull.  If, for example, mimicry (a biological response to a stimulus) is global, it is wrong to speak of the existence of single reactions to different colors: the influence of cultural and social associations is too strong. </li><li>  Color and floor.  Interesting is the detailed study and comparison of neurophysiological reactions in the time period up to 200 ms (subconscious perception) in men and women.  It was found that the neural activity in color perception in women is higher than in men.  Since this phenomenon was observed in the period of subconscious perception, it can be assumed that women react more emotionally to colors in general.  On the contrary, black and white images have a stronger effect on men. </li></ul><br><br><h2>  Second factor </h2><br>  The second important factor, as described earlier, are simple visual images.  For example, the image of sweets, the corresponding color can cause not only a feeling of appetite, but also affect the mood of a person. <br>  Scientists rarely attach importance directly to images, but it is proved that if you hang a still life in the kitchen, then a person quickly gets a sense of appetite, and if a picture with an image of flowers hangs in a room, then there is a feeling that the smell of these colors is barely heard. <br>  These simple images are laid in a person since childhood and are complemented throughout life. <br>  This factor, along with the first factor, is always taken into account when creating artificial intelligence systems that synthesize images, but do not take into account the equally important third factor. <br><br><br><h1>  Music </h1><br><h2>  First factor </h2><br>  In order to explain the mechanism of the effect of music on the human body, it is necessary to consider how a person perceives sound.  Sound vibrations are perceived either through the organs of hearing, transmitting the information received to specific parts of the brain, or vibrations of a certain frequency directly affect the functioning of individual organs and the organism as a whole.  In the first case, the brain, depending on the information received, sends signals to the organs that arise under its influence.  In the second case, the mechanism of action of sound vibrations is as follows.  Each organ works in its own special mode, the biorhythms of work of any healthy organ lie in a certain range of frequencies common to the vast majority of people.  For example, the frequency of the heart and smooth muscles of internal organs is close to 7 Hz.  Alpha mode of the brain - 4 - 6 Hz.  Beta mode - 20 - 30 Hz.  When the frequency of the sound oscillation coincides with or approaches the frequency of the biorhythms of an organ, the well-known phenomenon of resonance (amplification of oscillations) or antiresonance (suppression of oscillations) occurs.  Cases of the so-called incomplete resonance (partial coincidence of oscillations) are also possible. <br>  But, be that as it may, the organ begins to work in an unusual and disharmonious rhythm for it, which can lead to the development of the pathology of this organ, as well as of the whole organism.  A person hears sound vibrations on average with a frequency of 20 Hz to 20 KHz.  Above this range, the region of ultrasonic vibrations begins, but the direct effects on the body are mainly fluctuations from 2 to 10 Hz. <br><br>  So, music has an impact simultaneously in several directions.  We allow ourselves to abstain from the analysis of the psycho-emotional series, since such work requires considerable time and a separate large study with the involvement of psychologists and psychotherapists.  The subject of our further discussion will be exclusively low-frequency rhythmic oscillations. <br>  They manifest themselves in the rhythm (or tempo) of music, that is, in the number of beats (bars) per minute.  So, the waltz rhythm is about 50-80 beats per minute, in other words, about 1 Hz. <br>  Music intended for relaxation and meditation has a much slower rhythm.  Rock-n-roll and related musical forms have about 120 beats per minute, that is, about 2 Hz.  However, recently, musical directions are becoming more and more widespread, where the frequency of beats per minute reaches 240, that is, it is approaching 4 Hz.  Figuratively speaking, it is a direct blow directly to the brain. <br><br><h2>  Second factor </h2><br>  For simple sound associations, there is a term ‚Äúperception of complex sounds. <br>  The perception of complex sounds - the process of building the auditory image - based on sounds that have a complex spectral and rhythmic composition.  Difficult sounds have various sources, in accordance with which some of their signs come to the fore. <br>  First of all, the features of the structure of the acoustic spectrum are qualified as sounds of different qualities (deaf and ringing, soft and sharp, low or high).  Many sounds of nature (for example, rustling leaves, splashing water, crackling branches, crashing crashes, heartbeats) are single repetitive pulses when the frequency and regularity of this repetition are significant signs of orientation and building an adequate image of perception.  Speech sounds are analyzed not only by their meaning, but also - based on intonation characteristics, loudness, delays, tempo changes - by expressive filling.  In the perception of musical sounds, the signs that form its musical and sound fabric, such as the ladarharmonic ratios and rhythmic outline, become leading. <br><br><h1>  Third factor </h1><br>  No artificial intelligence system takes into account the third no less important, and perhaps more important factor - the patterned values ‚Äã‚Äãof human memory.  After all, undoubtedly, in everything that concerns art, for a deep awareness of the image, each person uses his own template visual and spectral images.  So it turns out that we all think in images and patterns?  Yes, that's exactly what happens. <br>  For each person, the set of template visual-spectral images is their own, but there are those that are typical for many people.  Those who have been specially trained have much more stereotyped visual-spectral images than those who have not been specially trained.  In essence, schools make a deep review of images (pictures and pictures) with detailed explanations, they only present templates to their listeners. <br>  As for music, a music school is nothing more than a template factory.  And the further a person learns, the more patterns he absorbs.  In the music school, visuals are also added to the sound images.  This explains the fact that children sitting on ‚Äúmusical literature‚Äù do not understand what they have to see, but when they study hard, they do not understand it themselves, absorb the pattern.  After just a few years, these same children will not only be able to tell what a person should ‚Äúsee‚Äù while listening to a particular classic work, but they themselves also feel it. <br>  All this means that the third factor is a certain combination of the second factor with thematic semantic overtones, which is laid in a work of art by the author.  As is well known, this subtext is not always correctly recognized, and each person has his own set of psycho-emotional and semantic associations of the same image. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/376713/">https://habr.com/ru/post/376713/</a></p>
