I work in the field of repair of equipment and I have always been interested in how the TAM service centers work, what is their attitude towards people, is there a difference in service, price and so on.  By the will of fate, I had to start from Buenos Aires, which I don‚Äôt regret.

Despite the fact that it was the center of the city, I was surprised by the lack of people and cars.  However, as it turned out later, this is quite an ordinary picture for Sunday.  By the weekend here are appropriate, and in order to just put money on the phone, sometimes you had to go around a couple of quarters.  Therefore, the first day was unloading, after almost 24-hour marathon Moscow - Buenos Aires. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b9f/d32/600/b9fd3260086e3afa0edaa2578193aa52.jpg"><br><br>  A week before departure, he began preparatory work, and as a result of the search, it turned out that the local service centers had virtually no websites.  And if there is, there are very few of them.  Often, sites of service centers in Buenos Aires are a business card site with the address and phone number.  Find out the estimated cost of repair can only call.  Having sent the letters and not having received the answer, I realized that I would have to act on the situation and already in place.  What made my trip more special was the fact that I do not speak Spanish a little less than completely, and not everyone understands English in Argentina. <br><br>  As it turned out later, service centers and the famous ‚Äúcellular repair‚Äù signs in Argentina are called Servicio t√©cnico and Repar√° el Celular. <br><br>  Using these keywords, I managed to find the organizations I was looking for and, if not the first time, but still get to work.  Many had to be surprised, ranging from prices to methods of repair. <br><br>  Let's start with the price.  The difference between them in Moscow and Buenos Aires is two- or even threefold.  For example, the average cost of replacing the screen on the iPhone 5 in Moscow is 4000r, while in Argentina - 10 000r (in terms of rubles).  For the repair of the iPhone they are taken reluctantly, when they even refused to replace the glass on the iPhone 3GS.  The first reason is expensive spare parts and costly repairs, the second is that not everyone undertakes to repair the iPhone in principle. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/244/748/e22/244748e22bcf18b1e274b784806b5e07.jpg"><br>  <i>Price list to repair the iPhone.</i>  <i>The Argentine peso to ruble exchange rate is about 1 to 5.</i> <br><br>  As they say, do not judge others by yourself - the iPhone in Argentina is not the most popular phone.  Approximately, like in our Moscow metro, you can find 3-4 iPhones per square meter, in Samsung Buenos Aires there is a Samsung Galaxy S3, although for us it has already remained part of the past.  No less popular are Nokia and Blackberry phones.  If, however, return to repair prices, the replacement of the Galaxy S3 screen module in Moscow will be about 6,500 rubles, in Argentina - 12,500. At the same time, the demand for this type of repair is enormous.  As for the timing, spare parts are rarely kept in stock, and are mostly supplied on request. <br><br>  On the fourth day of their stay in Buenos Aires, a letter came from the Apple Today service center, where they wrote that they would be happy to see me, and honestly admitted that English is difficult to come by. <br><br>  Upon arrival, I liked the distinctive part of the interior - the spiral staircase.  Always dreamed of such a child, a sort of grandfather's attic. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/61e/eb5/c20/61eeb5c20b3b42dafd4a88b4a427b88e.jpg"><br><br>  With regard to methods of repair, they are better to watch live in the video. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/Mi3YJrFU1MY%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=25657,15700021,15700186,15700190,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhgB0WjMw79SkmLU3POqpEeo-D-d9w" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  Come to Buenos Aires!  Not bad here.  But it is better to look after the phone better, because repairs will be expensive. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/224097/">https://habr.com/ru/post/224097/</a></p>
