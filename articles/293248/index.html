On the site of our friends and customers who are engaged in selling bowling pins, we hung up a <a href="http://www.pozvonim.com/">callback widget</a> , but slightly changed the logo. <br>  First, we hung a photo of the girl operator, then a guy, after which we placed a photo of Anatoly Wasserman on the widget.  Each client who ordered a call, we asked: "Who did they expect to talk to when ordering a call?" <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a0d/734/a21/a0d734a21de84568b07fcf9bb5ba15da.jpg" alt="image"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h2>  The course of the experiment </h2><br>  The experiment involved three images:

Thus, the survey showed that users still pay attention to the logo, and expect to talk with the one who is depicted on it. <br>  To confirm this hypothesis, we replaced the image of the guy-operator, with a photo of Anatoly Aleksandrovich Wasserman, and asked who the new group of clients expected to talk to this time. <br><br><ul><li>  11 - expected to hear a serious male voice; </li><li>  9 - said that they ordered a call back only because they wanted to talk with Anatoly Wasserman; </li><li>  5 - said they did not think about it; </li><li>  3 - wanted hoped to hear a female voice; </li><li>  2 - did not even hope that they would be called back; </li></ul><br>  We assume that 11 users who expected to hear a male voice simply did not understand who is depicted in the picture.  Therefore, we will add them to the group of those who expected to talk to the one shown in the picture. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/4c4/86c/b8c/4c486cb8c384445ab0ca045192281400.png" alt="image"><br><br>  By the way, if we analyze the time during which we received the first 30 calls in each case, then oddly enough, we had the girl‚Äôs logo as the fastest customers.  Here is how the wait time is distributed: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/60b/7b9/fb3/60b7b9fb33be4b1992fae2fbfcab6782.png" alt="image"><br><br>  As we see from the chart, the guy was the most unpopular among our clients.  The image of a well-known person on the widget's logo had a positive effect on the conversion of calls.  At the same time, the callers, hoping to talk to Wasserman, were in very good spirits, and even when they heard another voice, their mood remained positive.  Each of the 9 clients made an order. <br>  The most popular was the image of a girl, probably due to the fact that 90% of clients are men. <br>  Thus, our experiment showed that the image on the widget affects the expectation of most customers and the conversion of calls.  In our cases, the share of those who expected to hear the one depicted on the widget was 62.5%.  Therefore, test what you show to the user and find the best for you. <br>  For the kegel shop, we left an image of a female operator.  And what is depicted <a href="http://www.pozvonim.com/">on the callback widget</a> in your online store? <br><br>  with respect, <br>  <a href="http://www.pozvonim.com/">pozvonim.com</a> <br><br> <a href="http://www.pozvonim.com/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/2c9/045/e46/2c9045e46db640d38d4eb00907ac0a6a.png" alt="image"></a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/293248/">https://habr.com/ru/post/293248/</a></p>
