  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Funky project management model</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Classically funky is the direction of rhythm and blues music style.  But since the beginning of 2000, the definition has fallen into the business environment and the worldview of people.  Here it means making decisions on a wave of certain events, attentive attitude to the wishes of others and the embodiment of results in business decisions.  Based on this, we can conclude that project management in the style of funk includes the following items: <br><ul><li>  uncertainty; </li><li>  tension and at the same time drive, hobby; </li><li>  competition competition; </li><li>  search for differentiation, "highlights", work with emotions; </li><li>  the need for creative solutions. </li></ul><br>  Successful examples of funky projects were VKontakte applications.  Now the activities of various fashion trainings (we will not point the finger). <a name="habracut"></a><br>  Still, probably, Mr.  Freeman (and generally viral marketing).  But here the method is more suitable for developing the concept of an idea than for implementation. <br>  The general essence of funky-solutions includes several points: <br><ol><li>  Mixed creative team; </li><li>  Short term of project formation; </li><li>  Detailed review of the project - one day per direction; </li><li>  Active reflection; </li><li>  Attracting people unaware of what they are doing; </li><li>  Analysis of problems and risks, making decisions to eliminate them. </li></ol><br><h4>  Mixed creative team </h4><br>  This clause implies that the project team consists of people who are experts in various fields considered by the project.  Usually one to three regular participants who monitor the situation in each of the directions.  And the big turnover of people interested in forming a solution in the direction. <br>  Thus, in the project consisting of five points, five-15 plus three plus five (5-15 + 3 + 5) people will take part.  Three people form the backbone of the team constantly monitoring the formation of the project from a bird's-eye view.  Five people watching the situation within groups of directions. <br><br><h4>  Short term of project formation </h4><br>  Since the wave of public sentiment is passing quickly - it‚Äôs just not reasonable to spend time developing a full-scale project that meets all conditions and standards.  Therefore, for funky solutions, a term is established in proportion to the main areas that should be considered before a full start.  For example, if a viral solution is developed, the following points will be considered: <br><ul><li>  Project drive; </li><li>  Meaningfulness; </li><li>  Psychological influence; </li><li>  Call to action; </li><li>  Terms of distribution. </li></ul><br>  Thus, it takes five plus three (5 + 3) days to develop a funky virus.  Additional three days are required respectively: the first day for the initial review of the project and action plan, the penultimate day for evaluating the project from a bird's eye view, the last day for complete reflection and full analysis of information. <br><br><h4>  Detailed project review - one day per referral </h4><br>  This funky strategy implies that you cannot spend more than one day on the solution development points described above.  This day includes the following questions: <br>  <i>Beginning of the day</i> : Consideration of the project by all groups of directions from the point of view of the topic set for the current day.  Setting problems and risks associated with it.  Proposing solutions to eliminate negative factors. <br>  <i>The beginning of the day - lunch</i> : The application of the proposed solutions in practice.  Collection of information.  Attracting random people to participate in the project. <br>  <i>Lunch</i> : Short reflection within the group, external survey.  Analysis of the results.  Adjustment of decisions, with the participation of people involved, or information extracted from them. <br>  <i>Lunch - Dinner</i> : The application of revised solutions.  Collection of information.  Drain the wrong people, search for new ones. <br>  <i>Dinner</i> : Analysis of the collected information.  Analysis of the effectiveness of decisions.  Report generation.  General reflection.  Selection of the most high-quality solutions, consideration of unsolved problems and risks.  Setting the topic the next day. <br>  <i>Night</i> : If possible, collect additional information on the Internet on the topic the next day.

    <h4>  Active reflection </h4><br>  As can be seen from the previous part - the reflection takes place three times a day.  Two generals - in the morning and in the evening, one within the group - in the middle of the day.  At the same time, midday reflection includes interpersonal communication between groups.  Usually, one person from the team is responsible for this throughout the project. <br>  During morning reflection, decisions are considered and made that should be applied to each of the groups of directions.  This action within the framework of the project is successful, as it is considered by a group of experts with experience in the issues presented. <br>  Evening reflection includes an analysis of the results and exchange of experience, which is mainly used by the bird flight team to consider the current situation. <br><br><h4>  Attracting people unaware of what they are doing </h4><br>  During the application of the proposed solutions, as many people as possible are attracted to gather information, gain their experience and opinions.  They take part in various socially adapted games, events and activities aimed at studying the question posed.  Some are invited to participate in reflection or even further work on the project. <br>  The question regarding activities and actions is completely blurred, because all decisions in this regard are made regarding each task in view of the experience of team members and do not have clear and consistent points that could be described. <br><br><h4>  Analysis of problems and risks, making decisions on their elimination </h4><br>  These questions are solved during a general reflection.  The successful side of this method, as already mentioned, is the participation of a large number of experts in various fields who are able to clearly express their thoughts and propose solutions through the lens of experience regarding the current issue. <br><br><h4>  Direction Groups </h4><br>  The formation of teams is relatively random.  Among the people at the zero stage, who expressed their desire to take part in the project, experts are identified by areas and are mixed so that the team includes people who are experts in adjacent, but at the same time seriously different areas. <br>  For example, for the ‚Äúurban environment‚Äù team, three members of the group may be: a landscape designer, an IT specialist, a transportation system engineer.  All these specialists have experience in solving issues related to the urban environment, while their total experience increases many times over.  The landscape designer easily takes into account the aesthetic appearance of the decision, taking into account social engineering.  An IT specialist develops solutions for the provision of information services (including banal directional signs that play an unimportant role) to participants in the urban environment.  The engineer of transport systems proposes a solution for the formation of a city map taking into account all sorts of conditions and events of the environment. <br>  A separate item is to talk about groups of "bird flight" and "observers." <br>  Bird flight groups are made up of specialists in the areas of system analysis (or similar), senior managers, political analysts, psychologists, sociologists, and extremely desirable social engineers.  These specialists are able to see that it is not noticeable to narrow-profile experts and make decisions for them, or suggest unnoticed questions during reflection.  Almost ideally, the bird flight team will be: a system analyst, an enterprise director, a social engineer.  These are people speaking the same language, but seeing the situation from radically different points of view. <br>  The group of "observers" is formed to analyze the state within teams and the entire socio-psychological picture as a whole.  They are both motivators (in the event that the solution to a problem has stopped or reached a deadlock) and catalysts (if there are conflicts within the group or between groups in the process of solving or applying the solution).  It is desirable that this group consist of practicing psychologists, sociologists, teachers and linguists (linguists in the understanding - people who are able to speak, persuade and sell beautifully). <br><br><h4>  Conclusion </h4><br>  This approach has several advantages: <br><ol><li>  Ready solutions to eliminate risks and problems; </li><li>  A large amount of adequate information for analysis regarding the project; </li><li>  Vast experience of experts from various fields; </li><li>  An idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe further development of the project </li><li>  Small time spent on the decision, if it turns out to be unprofitable or impractical. </li></ol><br>  On the other hand, there are negative traits: <br><ol><li>  The absence of a financial and economic group; </li><li>  Lack of monetary assets to solve some problems; </li><li>  High costs of personal energy resources: <br><ul><li>  It is necessary to constantly move around and keep pace everywhere, especially in reflection; </li><li>  Make decisions quickly; </li><li>  Personally communicate with a large number of people (sometimes up to five or six hundred per day); </li><li>  It is not enough to sleep, almost not to eat (just not enough time). </li></ul></li></ol><br>  The first two points can be solved.  We get rid of the first problem, if we supplement the funky model with the fact that we will allocate an additional two days at the beginning and end of the project for financial and economic issues, with the involvement of experts in this field.  The second problem goes away if you deliberately determine a monetary asset for a job, therefore, funky-project or agree on additional investments in it. <br>  In general terms, the third point is more likely to play a positive role for the project itself, since the person working at the limit of his capabilities offers original and innovative solutions that can play a key role in starting a project in real conditions, adding exclusivity to it. <br><br>  Sources: <br><ul><li>  Training and personal experience with <a href="http://progressor.org/">GK "Progressor"</a> </li><li>  Talent, Design, Trends, Leadership / Tom Peters;  per.  from English  Marina Ermakova - SPb .: Stockholm School of Economics in St. Petersburg, 2006. - 162 pp .: ill.  - (Basics series); </li><li>  WOW ideas: 15 principles of innovation management / Peters Tom;  [trans.  from English  O.
