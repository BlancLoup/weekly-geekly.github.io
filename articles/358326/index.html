  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Productronic 2015</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Once every 2 years, in Munich, an exhibition is held, which is called Productronika.  This exhibition is all that went from idea to implementation, from unique solutions to simple (and not so) equipment in the field of microelectronics.  I was surprised that in November I did not see on Habr√© and GT any, even the most brief overview on this topic.  Well, I will try to fill this gap.  The technical component here will be not much - a very diverse and large exhibition - just a superficial overview.  In fact, I was surprisingly lucky at this exhibition - I was there not just as a participant, but as an organizer. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a79/a89/ab4/a79a89ab40204c89aa4b511cb19c68d9.JPG"><br><br>  About what was happening there, what I managed to see there, and how it was - under the cut. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  For me, it all started a little earlier, about two weeks before the exhibition.  I received a letter from the management stating that my presence there was highly desirable.  In addition, the letter was attached instructions, pages, so, probably, at 10, where it was painted, who, what, when, what will be busy.  Those.  it is banal, everything is painted: who flies to what time, who goes with whom, on what day what type of clothing should be, the program of events, which is limited not only by the exhibition itself.

      I am still amazed that I was in Munich for a few days, but I didn‚Äôt see the historical center of the city.  Of course, it all started with the fact that the stand was set.  I will not tell you anything about this stage, because I did not find it.  In Germany, turnkey service is very often practiced - equipment logistics, unloading and unloading, installation on a stand and, then, on the contrary, packing, loading and sending to the manufacturer - all this was done by one logistics company. <br><br>  Then there was the installation of equipment.  Something tuned, something insisted, something unpacked, in general, a normal working environment. <br><br>  In the evening there was a meeting, we were briefly described what would be changed, what our expectations of the exhibition would be for a sweet pass. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">A couple of photos - installation of equipment</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/151/e78/529/151e785291b4465b86a2c585b1688e76.JPG"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f25/5b4/917/f255b491700b4aceb9d0e4021c3dab9e.JPG"><br></div></div><br><h5>  Day 1 </h5><br>  Exhibition for visitors opened at 9-00.  For organizers an hour earlier.  I saw this on the first day, and there were no more such moments: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c00/700/09e/c0070009eb6a448dac7cf38ebcda3193.jpg"><br><br>  This day was the most not loaded, and I had free time to walk on the stands.  I decided to start with the most interesting for questions - materials for soldering.  I visited the stands of Senju Metal (It is a pity that Japanese companies now practically deliver nothing to the Russian Federation) the fluxes of these guys are very even nothing. <br><br>  A couple of words exchanged with representatives of Alpha Metal, did not forget about Heraeus and Henkel.  The history of selection of soldering materials is specific enough depending on the application technology, functional group and product characteristics.  I was interested in choosing to cover OSP, and had a good idea of ‚Äã‚Äãwhat I was looking for. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/59c/3d5/ac6/59c3d5ac6b644408b0611629bdda6255.jpg"><br><br>  The second item was my X-ray unit.  I am not strong on the subject here, so I turned to my colleagues and their recommendations.  I looked at Cheetah from the YXLON company, did not pass by the YAMAHA stand, and in general, looked at the monitoring and inspection systems. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/26b/021/b7e/26b021b7e33d451a88314a894dee2eb1.jpg"><br><br>  And I did not forget about the acoustic microscope: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/29a/0c0/d3e/29a0c0d3e62346d3bb16b2d842b37f1c.jpg"><br><br>  At this time, there were all sorts of lectures, discussions and meetings - anyone could come to listen.  My choice is SMT. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/2bc/5ea/a1f/2bc5eaa1f4194127a033517aa803bc5e.JPG"><br><br>  At this free time ended, I went to my booth, on the way just looking to look at the equipment of competitors.  And in the evening, when the visitors' exhibition closes, you can relax a bit, find out something interesting, ask about interesting requests (for example, one of the visitors asked if we can tell you something about condensation acid soldering), and generally drink beer. Germany is the same. <br><br><h5>  Day 2 </h5><br>  On the second day, there were much more people, and there was much less free time.  But it all started very positively.  At the meeting, we were told that on the first day we took one of five awards, Winner SMT Cluster for the Reel-to-Reel system.  I will not describe what is innovative in it, because it can be developed into a separate topic. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Reel-to-Reel full line</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/7ef/38a/662/7ef38a66246d48219c42f0e80008455a.JPG"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/60a/f1f/566/60af1f56607e477a9c384cb2cb8d5c4c.JPG"><br></div></div><br>  Just a week before, I jumped in to a friend ‚Äî a service engineer ‚Äî to work.  We discussed about the organization of the working space.  So, I just could not pay attention: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/5b2/079/4fb/5b20794fb43d4dc6a86bdbfb6ae21bfb.jpg"><br><br>  And again I walked a little on the stands.  Some simply surprised. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/769/233/2da/7692332da7d44c07ba3c915a3347ffbc.jpg"><br><br>  We must pay tribute to the company ASM, probably the largest stand, various equipment, and a lot of visitors. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/48d/392/624/48d3926249a14bac8c78f043aae49db7.jpg"><br><br>  At that moment I did not know that ASM would give me another gift.  Already closer to closing I was given an invitation to a private event from ASM. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Complimentary ticket</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/298/ae2/225/298ae222543146cd9ab4e58c15a3c459.jpg"><br></div></div><br>  Venue - Allianz Arena stadium, the number of guests - about 1000. In general - very fun.  Of the bonuses - a tour of the stadium, a variety of drinks and traditional dishes of Bavaria, and this, not counting the entertainment program. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Stadium</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/146/0e7/4f8/1460e74f84bd4f98becf7ac6f1479dfd.JPG"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/8eb/39c/f53/8eb39cf537a34d948d72eebf9b084cdd.JPG"><br></div></div><br><h5>  Day 3 </h5><br>  It was my last day at the show.  And the most interesting.  Yes, there were a lot of people, yes, in three days I didn‚Äôt get around everything. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Booth visitors</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/8be/288/17a/8be28817af684ba88ac8e40f550bff0c.JPG"><br></div></div><br>  But it was a minor one, the main one was a meeting organized in the afternoon.  There is such a technique ‚Äúvoice of the customer‚Äù, the essence of which is quite simple, and the implementation is usually lame.  Up to this point, I just read about this technique.  And then we managed to participate in live.  The premises were rented, where various technical specialists were invited - customers dealing with soldering issues, not standard tasks, and keeping abreast.  For our part there were several speakers who told us, and what we were doing here, actually, recently was doing.  Then the professor came out and began to communicate with the customer.  He, in fact, set people up for a dialogue, during which I heard many interesting and not trivial tasks.  In this case, the implementation of the methodology went perfectly well, we even heard some see the development of the industry where you can go.  There were questions about fast switching recipes, there were questions about different soldering profiles at the bottom and top of the PCB.  There were more interesting ideas, but, for obvious reasons, they will not be described here. <br><br>  View from the audience at the exhibition: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/698/6b9/479/6986b947901c4d839d9280961e9a64dc.jpg"><br><br>  Pro awards can be read <a href="http://www.productronica.com/trade-fair/exhibition-profile/events/awards/innovation-award/">on the event website</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/358326/">https://habr.com/ru/post/358326/</a></p>
