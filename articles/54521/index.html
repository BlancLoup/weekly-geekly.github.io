Practically in every office today you can hear the radio, which, in the opinion of some, ‚Äúraises the productivity of work‚Äù, and, in the opinion of others, it only hinders concentration and relaxes.  In some offices you can meet people where everyone is sitting with ‚Äúhis own music‚Äù in headphones. <br><br>  In fact, the right music, which is pleasant to most listeners, significantly improves efficiency.  Experts have already calculated everything for a long time: when using music in workplaces, activity in the first hour of work increases by 10%, the probability of making a mistake is reduced by 30%, the overall working capacity increases to 70%.  For psychologists, the positive influence of music on labor productivity is a thing that has long been proven: studies on this topic have been conducted since the end of the 19th century.  Such music has been called functional, background, or music environment. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  What are the options? </h4><br>  Radio ¬´ <a href="http://www.101.ru/%3Fan%3Dchannel%26channel%3D27%26x%3D9%26y%3D9">Office Lounge</a> ¬ª - the soundtrack of a successful business, the creators of the radio channel call themselves.  According to ideology, music is playing that contributes to the work, improves productivity.  I tried to work with such music - it distracts me, but someone likes it.

      <a href="http://www.mustherapy.ru/p1_of.htm">A set of discs</a> "Background music for the office."  The set includes the ‚Äúgolden musical fund of modern times,‚Äù which, according to sellers, gives the effect of unloading nerve centers, stimulating thinking, relieves waiting syndrome. <br><br>  You can use the services of a <a href="http://www.r-mediaservice.ru/fonovaya_muzyka_v_ofis_i">special company</a> that is engaged in selecting the ‚Äúbackground music‚Äù. <blockquote>  Background music is a serious question, the selection of tracks must be approached carefully, carefully and professionally, because the task of background music in the office is to achieve the desired effect: to increase the motivation of employees, their performance, and not vice versa - to make them leave the workplace forgetting everything. </blockquote><br>  Radio, ‚Äúspecial background music‚Äù, company services, all this is nice, but your team may not always like it. <br><br><h4>  Web 2.0 style output </h4><br>  We will use the experience of Sergey Petrenko, Yandex.Ukraine CEO, who solved the problem with the <a href="http://www.lastfm.ru/">last.fm</a> service: <br><br><blockquote>  The idea to take advantage of the ubiquitous web-quest won, and seems to have already justified itself in practice.  All employees were invited to register at Last.fm, where they were united in one group.  After about a week of intensive listening (9 people reached the group, which is slightly less than half of the total number of office staff) the group got the first joint hearing ratings and (for which everything was started) the group radio started working.  That is, it remains for us to put a computer with speakers, go to the page above and launch the flash player.  Music plays around the clock and while the radio on the service side is breaking more often than something we have. <br><br>  It is curious that now, when suddenly the music turns out to be not quite suitable for the general taste of those sitting in the dining room, this does not cause outright aversion, but more interest ‚ÄúAnd who is listening to this?‚Äù.  What in general, in my opinion, helps to build relationships in a team. <br></blockquote><br>  <b>A good solution that takes into account the tastes of employees, unites the team and increases the efficiency of the office.</b>  <b>:)</b> <br>  It will only work on condition that the workspace is divided into offices, since  otherwise m.  too much discrepancy of tastes.  Separation into cabinets will help increase the efficiency of workers; you can make ‚Äúcabinets of silence‚Äù for those who like silence.  And to make a free zone in such offices, so that colleagues with laptops, who sometimes want to just silence, could go there. <br><br><h5>  Sources </h5><br>  <a href="http://www.hr-ua.com/articles/1623/">Music at work - helps or hurts?</a> <br>  <a href="http://otvet.mail.ru/question/18606805/">Answers@Mail.Ru</a> : Would you like to include background music in the office?
