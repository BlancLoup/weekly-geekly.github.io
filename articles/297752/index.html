You have the right not to provide this data to him by refusing the service. <br>  You can start exploring the question from here - base.garant.ru/10164072/28 <br><br>  &gt; private domain use is a paid service <br>  If you are talking about a private person in whois, it depends on the registrar's arrogance, for almost everyone this service is free. </blockquote><blockquote>  ICANN obliges registrars to verify data, ownership of email and even the existence of a domain owner's address, with the proviso ‚Äúif there is such an opportunity‚Äù.  It also imposes the obligation to block domains if data is not confirmed.  The organization is of course non-profit, but you enter into a contract and agree to the terms, so everything is legal.  On the other hand, not all registrars need a passport scan, this is already a private version of the interpretation of the rules of a particular registrar, ICANN does not say exactly how to ensure that the data is correct.  I do not like the mandatory sending of the scan, find a registrar that does not require it.  For example, Pananames, at the same time, whois privacy is free. </blockquote><br> <a href="https://toster.ru/tag/%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B2%25D1%2582%25D0%25BE%25D1%2580%25D1%2581%25D0%25BA%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B5%2520%25D0%25BF%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B2%25D0%25BE/interest_questions"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/9cc/d56/305/9ccd56305f9642d78e4663edc732b5b5.png" align="right"></a> <h4>  <a href="https://toster.ru/tag/%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B2%25D1%2582%25D0%25BE%25D1%2580%25D1%2581%25D0%25BA%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B5%2520%25D0%25BF%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B2%25D0%25BE/interest_questions">"Copyright" section</a> </h4><br>  Interest Ask: <br><br>  - <a href="https://toster.ru/q/273592">‚ÄúIs copyright infringed?‚Äù</a> <br><br>  <i>Good day to all toasters.</i>  <i>A question.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>There is a printed magazine with a picture and a note.</i>  <i>I post information on the site.</i>  <i>I take a picture, and I write my description, because</i>  <i>kinda kind rewriting in your own words.</i>  <i>At the end of the page I write "According to the materials of the journal ....".</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>I do not see a violation of this law, because</i>  <i>I have a magazine.</i>  <i>I posted a picture and described it actually in my own words + indicated the source.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>If I'm wrong, please explain.</i> <blockquote>  Did the magazine give you the right to reproduce the picture?
