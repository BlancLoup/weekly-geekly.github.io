      Our company also did not stand aside. <br>  XIM and XIMAD will occupy box <b>number 2423</b> , which can be easily found by the elegant two-meter figures - the characters of our new game Star Crusade. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/5a1/0d8/cd2/5a10d8cd2a314bd7b31fe2fecf0fc64b.png"><br><br>  <b>Star crusade</b> <br>  <i>Star Crusade</i> is a multiplayer collectible card online game inspired by games like <i>Magic: the Gathering</i> and <i>Hearthstone</i> , but with a unique theme of space fiction.  We offer a unique universe, the world of the future in the style of science fiction, in which different space factions are at war with each other.  At the GDC, the DEMO version of the game will be presented for the first time, and anyone can plunge into the atmosphere of our universe.  <i>Star Crusade</i> , like all collectible card games, is as accessible and understandable.  But we tried to take the best from today's popular game analogs and make the game less cartoony, with a faster change of the game situation and a dynamic plot.  In the future, we plan to implement the exchange of cards between players.  Say nothing more to keep the intrigue. <br><br>  <b>Magic jigsaw puzzles</b> <br>  In addition to new directions, the flagship of the company XIMAD - <i>Magic Jigsaw Puzzles</i> (Wonder Puzzles) will be presented.  Puzzles have been and remain the leading application, recognizable and appreciated both abroad and in Russia.  It was our first global experiment to turn an ordinary puzzle game into a full-fledged gaming service.  Thus, the market simply has no analogues to our application, or rather to the range of services and benefits that users acquire thanks to it.  We managed to collect more than 5,000 virtual puzzles in one application.  Due to the presence of its own store, each user can choose only those packages that are really interesting to him, without being lost in a few thousand pictures.  The players have personal accounts with which they can control all the actions performed within the game.  At the moment we are working on improving the social functions of the application, we want to give our users the opportunity not only to create their own puzzles (since this function has already been implemented), but also to be able to collect puzzles created by other players. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/769/216/196/769216196e3c4eb4baef55e8fc7c66df.png"><br><br>  XIM also introduces its product line, focusing on business trends. <br><br>  <b>In-Game Analytics</b> <br>  Most of the mobile games and applications ‚Äúburn through‚Äù, losing their users due to not understanding the gaming audience.  To avoid this problem, it is necessary to conduct a thorough analysis of the players.  This will help our own development of <i>In-Game Analytics</i> - a tool that provides a full analysis of all game events, target user groups and the most important KPIs, such as active users per day / week / month, average income per player, game duration, etc. With the help of <i>In-Game Analytics,</i> you can clearly determine who mostly plays or uses the mobile application and how they behave;  when they leave the game;  what is most often bought and in what situations, as well as many other things.  Popular game analytics do not provide such accurate and timely information about the game as <i>In-Game Analytics</i> .  If you have questions, we will be happy to answer them. <br><br>  <b>Multiplatform Solutions Framework</b> <br>  When you have already figured out who the target audience of the mobile application is and how it behaves, it is necessary to start setting it up in accordance with the characteristics of the users.  Here <i>Multiplatform Solutions Framework</i> is a tool for flexible setting of game content and game / application management.  The service has a number of significant advantages not only for developers, but also for project managers and the players themselves: speeding up the development process of a mobile application through the use of ready-made modules, full management of game content and player profiles, application version control, and a single profile for all platforms, which allows players are free to play both from a smartphone, tablet, and on social networks, keeping all purchases and achievements.  And this is not an exhaustive list of all the advantages of the service. <br>  Using analytics and customization, you can improve the monetization of the application and get a higher income.  Our partners - XIMAD - use the <i>Multiplatform Solutions Framework</i> in all their games. <br><br>  <b>Automated QA System</b> <br>  Adaptation of the application to the requirements of the audience does not guarantee complete success.  Constantly ‚Äúdeparting‚Äù application with a bunch of bugs and errors will repel players, and it will be very difficult to return them.  There is a need to thoroughly test the application.  Testing automation will save developers and QA engineers time, at the same time saving the process from human errors.  Detailed test reports will help you better understand the bottlenecks of the application and fix them quickly. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/71a/b53/638/71ab53638ebf4849be97a154571173ad.jpg"><br><br>  <b>Video Optimizer</b> <br>  At the conference, we will demonstrate our capabilities in video optimization and the development of various applications for editing and broadcasting video in real time. <br>  Video recording requires a lot of hard disk space.  Therefore, there is a need to reduce the size of the video, while maintaining its quality.  The photo shows a frame from the original 8-second video on iPad 1080p, 21Mb in size, (left) and optimized, 2 Mb in size (right). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/4ec/fd2/f65/4ecfd2f654cb47a7846710cfee640aab.png"><br><br>  Optimized video will be faster downloaded to the network or broadcast in real time to another device, which will also save Internet traffic.  A nice feature of the service is the ability to add various funny effects to the video. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a05/d08/e16/a05d08e16d344f8abab33a09c2269729.png"><br><br>  The service can be implemented both on the client side and on the server side for any popular server, desktop or mobile platform (Windows, Mac OS, Linux, iOS, Android). <br><br>  At the GDC you can meet with our representatives. <br>  For all questions regarding XIM services, please send your letters to <b>contact@ximxim.com</b> with the name of the program: <br><ul><li>  In-Game Analytics </li><li>  Multiplatform Solutions Framework </li><li>  Automated QA System </li><li>  Video Optimizer </li></ul><br>  Olga Rozhnova, marketing manager, and Alexander Konstantinov, director of advertising, will participate from XIMAD.  For all questions related to the purchase of our traffic, please contact Alexander or send your letters to <b>ad_ops@ximad.com</b> .  You can discuss the prospects for cooperation in advertising and UA campaigns with Olga or through a request to <b>marketing@ximad.com</b> <br><br>  Follow our news on the hashtag conference <b># XIMGDC2015</b> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/251707/">https://habr.com/ru/post/251707/</a></p>
