Every year we grow and expand.  This year we made an event dedicated to databases in the broad sense of the word. <br><br>  A week ago, the <b><a href="https://pgday.ru/ru/2017/schedule%3Futm_source%3Dhabr%26utm_medium%3Dpost%26utm_campaign%3Dprogram1">full conference schedule</a></b> was published.  The event is expected to be very eventful: a <b>school day</b> that includes 11 master classes;  Greenplum Day is a <b>free event</b> dedicated to the analytic platform of the same name from our partners Dell / EMC and Pivotal;  <b>two days of</b> reports - over <b>60</b> speeches in six sections. <br><br>  On the eve of the conference together with <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/users/hydrobiont/" class="user_link">hydrobiont</a> we have compiled for you a selection of the most vivid and memorable performances. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/bc5/d2a/9d8/bc5d2a9d8b614356b5d435320096c940.png">

      Interesting reports will be enough for everyone.  Developers will like the speeches of experts from Data Egret.  <b>Max Boguk</b> is a unique specialist and does not need a database to figure out how the optimizer will work.  Max will share his supernormal abilities in the report " <a href="https://pgday.ru/ru/2017/papers/232%3Futm_source%3Dhabr%26utm_medium%3Dpost%26utm_campaign%3Dprogram1"><b>Non-classical techniques for query optimization in PostgreSQL, or how to teach an elephant to dance rock and roll</b></a> ."  To understand what exactly is waiting for you on the Max report, I invite you to watch the <a href="https://pgday.ru/files/pgmaster14/max.boguk.query.optimization.pdf">presentation of 2014</a> , with which Max spoke at one of our meetings, called PG Master. <br><br>  <b>Alexey Ermakov</b> , Max‚Äôs partner in Data Egret, has at least an intimidating amount of knowledge on the internal structure of PostgreSQL mechanisms.  Deep technical reports Lesha enjoyed great demand for the past PG Day.  This year, Alexey will bring an interesting technical report about the <a href="https://pgday.ru/ru/2017/papers/170%3Futm_source%3Dhabr%26utm_medium%3Dpost%26utm_campaign%3Dprogram1"><b>internal structure of the PostgreSQL query planner</b></a> .  To estimate the depth of Alexey‚Äôs immersion in technical details, I invite you to familiarize yourself with the <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/pgdayrussia/blog/329542/">transcription of his report</a> on one of the past PG Day. <br><br>  Especially to please all admins and devops, a <b>star troop from Zalando</b> comes to us <b>: Alexander Kukushkin, Alexey Klyukin and Murat Kabilov</b> .  In the framework of two reports, colleagues will share their successful experience in operating PostgreSQL as a cloud platform.  Every day, Zalando faces a unique challenge: how to unite dozens of disparate teams working on the development of numerous components of a huge business, without having to demand the same technology stack from each of them.  Answer: a <b>single platform for data storage</b> .  It's no secret that developers like clouds for lack of the need to manually manage the database.  Specialists from Zalando decided not to swim against the current, accepted the need for an effective cloud platform and wrote some of their tools to help the Posgres run efficiently in Amazon AWS.  The guys will share their experiences in two reports: ‚Äú <b><a href="https://pgday.ru/ru/2017/papers/195%3Futm_source%3Dhabr%26utm_medium%3Dpost%26utm_campaign%3Dprogram1">PostgreSQL‚Äú in a cube ‚Äù: Kubernetes for highly accessible databases in Zalando</a></b> and <a href="https://pgday.ru/ru/2017/papers/136%3Futm_source%3Dhabr%26utm_medium%3Dpost%26utm_campaign%3Dprogram1"><b>PostgreSQL on AWS: Tips &amp; Tricks (and horror stories)</b></a> ‚Äù. <br><br>  <b>Ispirer Systems will</b> present a very interesting report that will be interesting to all.  Colleagues from Ispirer Systems claim that efficient <b><a href="https://pgday.ru/ru/2017/papers/200%3Futm_source%3Dhabr%26utm_medium%3Dpost%26utm_campaign%3Dprogram1">automation of SQL and application code migration is possible</a></b> !  At PG Day, the company's specialists will present a solution that allows you to automatically convert business logic, both SQL objects and application code.  Come listen and discuss :-) <br><br>  The peak of the trend for import substitution came and went.  Long disputes have subsided, and all interested companies, forcedly or voluntarily, are quietly moving in a new direction for them.  Have you ever wondered how today's Posgrais lives in a bloody enterprise?  Exactly this will tell <b>Anton Bushmelev</b> in the report of the same name " <a href="https://pgday.ru/ru/2017/papers/124%3Futm_source%3Dhabr%26utm_medium%3Dpost%26utm_campaign%3Dprogram1"><b>Bloody Enterprise, or how we tamed an elephant</b></a> ."  The company RT Labs, a division of Rostelecom, has been successfully using PostgreSQL for the second year in new projects.  Anton will share his experience in implementing the ambush on PG Day. <br><br>  <b>Extreme workloads on a DBMS</b> are a regular situation in the life of developers and administrators from the Avito team.  The operating experience will come to share <b>Victor Yagofarov</b> , a DBA company.  In the report you will find a story about the <b><a href="https://pgday.ru/ru/2017/papers/152%3Futm_source%3Dhabr%26utm_medium%3Dpost%26utm_campaign%3Dprogram1">internal structure and secrets of pgBouncer</a></b> , tuning under high loads, ensuring fault tolerance and many other secrets of one of the most popular connection poolers in the world of PostgreSQL. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/5ae/01f/f9d/5ae01ff9d94549d49303c832936a10e6.png"><br><br>  This year we expanded the scope of the conference and invited professionals who work with popular commercial and open source databases to the event.  We will tell you a little about the most interesting speeches dedicated to Oracle and MS SQL Server, which are worth a visit for both post-pressists and colleagues from the Enterprise world. <br><br>  The most important report in this section will be presented by <b>Viktor Egorov</b> , DBA from Data Egret.  Based on his experience with both PostgreSQL and Oracle, Victor will conduct a <b><a href="https://pgday.ru/ru/2017/papers/190%3Futm_source%3Dhabr%26utm_medium%3Dpost%26utm_campaign%3Dprogram1">comparative review of the architecture of both databases</a></b> .  The report will be divided into several sections devoted to specific architectural solutions: <b>working with memory</b> , <b>processes</b> , <b>versioning</b> and <b>data storage</b> .  The report will be of interest to many.  PostgreSQL users will be able to look at another DBMS, its features and capabilities, some of which can be implemented in PostgreSQL.  PostgreSQL developers may have ideas about the future direction of the development of Posgres.  On the other hand, all Oracle users will be able to evaluate the capabilities of an open database.  This is especially true for representatives of organizations that reflect on migration. <br><br>  All fans of "hardcore" we also have something to please.  Experts from the <b>technology center of Deutsche Bank</b> are preparing a whole three cool technical report.  Dmitry Remizov will teach a lesson on the <b><a href="https://pgday.ru/ru/2017/papers/176%3Futm_source%3Dhabr%26utm_medium%3Dpost%26utm_campaign%3Dprogram1">anatomy of the cursor</a></b> , Nikolai Kudinov will talk about <b><a href="https://pgday.ru/ru/2017/papers/177%3Futm_source%3Dhabr%26utm_medium%3Dpost%26utm_campaign%3Dprogram1">tracing user processes and minimizing expectations</a></b> , and <b>Alexander Khalukhin</b> will hold a practical <b><a href="https://pgday.ru/ru/2017/papers/125%3Futm_source%3Dhabr%26utm_medium%3Dpost%26utm_campaign%3Dprogram1">workshop on diagnosing the performance of Oracle Database</a></b> . <br><br>  We did not leave without attention and specialists in <b>MS SQL Server</b> .  Independent consultant <b>Ilya Verbitsky,</b> using the example of <b>SQL Server 2016</b> security system, tells about the painful problem: how to restrict access to data and <b><a href="https://pgday.ru/ru/2017/papers/130%3Futm_source%3Dhabr%26utm_medium%3Dpost%26utm_campaign%3Dprogram1">create a safe environment for your business</a></b> .  For all professionals who want to improve their level of proficiency in MS SQL Server, <b>Konstantin Taranov</b> , a specialist at one of the Gazprom divisions, will conduct an intensive ‚Äú <b><a href="https://pgday.ru/ru/2017/papers/128%3Futm_source%3Dhabr%26utm_medium%3Dpost%26utm_campaign%3Dprogram1">SQL Server for one day</a></b> ‚Äù crash-course, designed to help you learn how to effectively use this product. <br><br>  During the master class will address the following questions: <br><ul><li>  comparing SQL Server functionality with Oracle and PostgreSQL; </li><li>  the choice of the version and release of SQL Server taking into account the tasks you are solving; </li><li>  SQL Server configuration and setup; </li><li>  TSQL - proven practice when writing good code; </li><li>  development tools and administration tools for SQL Server - free and paid tools. </li></ul><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/414/224/097/414224097cc84daba04192d239cfb704.png"><br><br>  This year, the PG Day Russia conference will also host the first <b>open database section</b> other than PostgreSQL.  The selection of reports for this section in the Program Committee of the conference was supervised by the General Director of Perkona <b>Peter Zaitsev</b> .  What is waiting for you in this section? <br><br>  First of all, these are three serious technical reports from Perconas about the internal structure of MySQL and MongoDB: <br><ul><li>  <b><a href="https://pgday.ru/ru/2017/papers/209%3Futm_source%3Dhabr%26utm_medium%3Dpost%26utm_campaign%3Dprogram1">transaction processing in MySQL-derived databases</a></b> from Nikolai Ikhalainen; </li><li>  <b><a href="https://pgday.ru/ru/2017/papers/178%3Futm_source%3Dhabr%26utm_medium%3Dpost%26utm_campaign%3Dprogram1">storage on the LSM tree as a database engine.</a></b>  <b><a href="https://pgday.ru/ru/2017/papers/178%3Futm_source%3Dhabr%26utm_medium%3Dpost%26utm_campaign%3Dprogram1">The MongoRocks experience</a></b> from Denis Andensky; </li><li>  <b><a href="https://pgday.ru/ru/2017/papers/149%3Futm_source%3Dhabr%26utm_medium%3Dpost%26utm_campaign%3Dprogram1">Efficient debugging of MySQL replication</a></b> performed by Sveta Smirnova. </li></ul><br>  An amazing use-case was brought by colleagues from their <b>IT department at MTS</b> .  It turns out that a solution for a centralized system for managing balances, meters, subscriber batteries in real time, <b><a href="https://pgday.ru/ru/2017/papers/137%3Futm_source%3Dhabr%26utm_medium%3Dpost%26utm_campaign%3Dprogram1">built on the basis of MySQL Cluster</a></b> , has been in operation for about a year by MTS and continues to evolve.  Curious?  And we, too, come to listen together :-) <br><br>  On PG Day, you can learn first-hand the nuances of the <b>ElasticSearch</b> and <b>MongoDB</b> devices.  <b>Philipp Krenn</b> and <b>Henrik Ingo</b> , experts from <b>Elastic</b> and <b>MongoDB,</b> will be visiting us.  During the conference, colleagues will hold master classes, reports and seminars on the development of their companies.  Philipp's report and seminar will focus on <b><a href="https://pgday.ru/ru/2017/papers/133%3Futm_source%3Dhabr%26utm_medium%3Dpost%26utm_campaign%3Dprogram1">internal organization</a></b> and <b><a href="https://pgday.ru/ru/2017/papers/132%3Futm_source%3Dhabr%26utm_medium%3Dpost%26utm_campaign%3Dprogram1">examples of full-text search organization</a></b> using Elasticsearch.
