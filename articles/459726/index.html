Probably loudly said, however, having recently arranged an evening of memories, I realized that during this time 12 circles in Russia were opened under my leadership.  Today I decided to write about the main things that I did in the process of discovery, but you definitely do not need to do this.  So to say, concentrated experience in 7 points.  Selected only the juice.  Enjoy reading. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <u>1. To open immediately in the expensive room</u> , which puts the entire financial model on the blades, located in a shopping or business center. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/zj/8g/pa/zj8gpac5yfmeboym3tismwlels4.jpeg">

      Open strictly in a residential area, near its customers.  If you live in a very small city - open near schools.  You can always find a suitable room.  For my way, I looked through at least 50 rooms for a circle of robotics and it always turned out to choose the one that is outdated by the basic parameters. <br><br>  <u>2. Hire a teacher without experience working with children.</u> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/vw/fj/fi/vwfjfi90bm4hrywsxeuwfrsht00.jpeg"><br><br>  At first, I thought that practically every handy peasant could be a teacher, and I took these to work.  My first teacher is a former police officer with a correspondence degree in law education, engaged in painting cars.  A small city imposes great restrictions on the search and choice of a teacher, but you can find it.) Believe me, you can definitely find it.  Just need to look in advance.  Best of all, if you start the lesson at first you yourself, in order to feel the inner kitchen and keep your finger on the pulse in the future. <br><br>  <u>3. Do not use interactive in the classroom</u> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/bi/ad/n8/biadn8hdvkbb3nqkefnv3icvww4.jpeg"><br><br>  In the modern world, knowledge is far from the only reason why children come to a technical circle.  In Soviet times, young technicians and other establishments had a recording contest at the stations.  Getting there was not so easy.  Children were fully trained in cool things and the way there was closed was broken.  Now the situation has changed radically - you have to fight for every client, and very often not all clients of the quality you need.  I very rarely expel children from school because of bad behavior.  But there has not yet been a single circle in which I would not chase the children.  Their arrogance greatly exceeds my pedagogical skills.  The key to the solution is interactive in the classroom.  Before teaching children, sat down the most important step - to interest children.  Initially, the entourage of the room and the story that you tell when recording.  In the future - interesting activities, in which 80% of the practice. <br><br>  <u>4. Choose the wrong class format.</u> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/va/rw/ei/varweinxzz5eypbuajxdlmhgizg.jpeg"><br><br>  Have you ever tried to dock 50 people in groups for 1 hour 2 times a week?  One of the basic rules of business is to make money easily.  We are often afraid to test some moments, citing imaginary reasons.  This is called a limiting belief.  We spent a long time with the transition to the format of classes - once a week for 3 hours.  We thought that it would not work, that a significant percentage of children would stop walking.  As a result, they worked 6 days a week.  It happened that only 1 lesson per day, while you need to spend time on the road.  The schedule is not particularly pleased.  When they switched to the format - once a week, for 3 hours, while only classes were held on weekends - only a few children fell off, and much more new ones arrived.  You work 2 days a week - you work 5 days, too, but on expensive work.) Or you take a rest.  In general, this schedule is much nicer. <br><br>  <u>5. Do not count finance.</u> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/7k/dj/r-/7kdjr-adbm5yahil1l6m5fcicuu.jpeg"><br><br>  It would seem, then to lead the financial model with a turnover of 100-200 thousand rubles?  And so everything is plus or minus clear.  20,000 for rent, 5,000 for consumables, something for taxes, the rest is in your pocket.  Yes, only this approach will lead you to the cash gap.  On such a small revolving, it will be quite small, but still.  Do you take into account that in the summer there will be some kind of prostage on revenues?  And in January?  And the fact that in December there will be almost no new records?  What you spend your advertising budget for a poorly tuned advertising campaign?  - How will the money be spent, but customers will not come?  From the very beginning, keep a complete financial model.  It will save you from the most blatant mistakes that you will not see at close range. <br><br>  <u>6. Unreasoned to buy equipment.</u> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/tg/kd/dy/tgkddydn1rcj2-5xhvhygw9zvxq.jpeg"><br><br>  Equipment and tools in the circle should be with a small margin, and this is understandable.  However, many at the start of the circle are thinking about buying CNC and laser machines, soldering stations and much more.  As a result, the budget for the most necessary is not enough.  Children come to classes, on the tables they are waiting for new beautiful soldering stations.  Yes, that's just if you bought them all consumables?  Solder, flux?  Made a hood with carbon filters?  Bought goggles?  And the first-aid kit with ointments for burns?  Strippers and wires?  Third hand?  Braid for soldering?  And this is not a complete list.  How not to forget to buy all the equipment?  When the circle is ready, sit in it for a couple of days and do all the projects half a year ahead that you will give to the children.  Look at the tool that you will use, multiply by the number of children in groups.  Record and buy what is missing.  On the one hand, you will be sure that there will be no shortage of tools and equipment in the classroom, on the other hand, you will receive models of projects that children will do.  You can demonstrate them.  The level of involvement in this case will be much higher. <br><br>  <u>7. When registering for classes to sell parent classes.</u> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/j_/nx/ze/j_nxzeue9oxq8nvfyrqqijrf8my.jpeg"><br><br>  What is the main product of your robotics group?  It is important to understand that you are not selling subscriptions to classes, you are selling a customer pain solution.  What is the pain of parents who write to children?  If you understand this immediately, then absolutely everyone who called you will come to classes.  Conversion 100%!  How do you?  For example, in our classes, the child practices 80% of the time.  At the first free trial lesson, he will already work with the tool.  Find out what types of saws are and what you need to cut.  What is the difference between emery papers and which wood is better to grind than the bolt differs from a self-tapping screw?  Learn to use the square, ruler and roulette.  And this is only the first lesson.  Can you imagine what will happen in a month when we add drawing reading and programming to these skills?  Work with machines?  Soldering  We will grow in your son all the skills of an engineer on real projects.  Changes you notice in a week.  At the time of graduation, your son will know exactly where to go to study further, because  in our circle he will try and learn all the directions of engineering. <br><br>  <u><b>What else?</b></u> <br><br>  In fact, the question of opening a circle is very much.  I identified 22 questions that need to be worked out in detail before, during, and after opening.  Only by examining each question in detail do you minimize the risks of failure of your circle.  Over the past year I received a lot of messages and applications asking for help in certain opening issues.  This year I had several difficult periods connected with a cash gap of 5 million rubles, and at that time I frankly merged requests for help, but at other times it was open.  Therefore, I am ready to help in any of your endeavors.) <br><br>  Actually 22 questions that need to be worked out when opening a robotics circle: <br><br>  <u><b>Concept and traffic</b></u> <br><br>  1. Market Analysis <br>  2. Search location <br>  3. Calendar Plan of Discovery <br>  4.Advertising <br>  5. Points of contact with target audience <br>  6. How to record in class. <br>  7. Sales <br><br>  <u><b>Financial planning and equipment</b></u> <br><br>  8. Financial model <br>  9. Pricing <br>  10. Purchase of furniture <br>  11. Purchase of electronics <br>  12. Purchase of computers <br>  13. Registration of the room <br>  14. Repair and placement <br><br>  <u><b>Legal Issues and Curriculum</b></u> <br><br>  15. Class of employment <br>  16. Training programs <br>  17. Opening of SP <br>  18. Age groups <br>  19. Agreements with parents <br><br>  <u><b>The finish</b></u> <br><br>  20.Robo day <br>  21. First lesson <br>  22. Hiring teachers <br><br>  Each question is a topic for a separate article.  Maybe someday I will charge so much that I will draw up detailed articles for each item, but I can‚Äôt promise.) It will definitely help to understand that there is interest in this topic, so you are welcome to comment. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/459726/">https://habr.com/ru/post/459726/</a></p>
