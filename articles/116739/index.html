However, everything looks more than serious.  Currently, Google is working to create a mobile application that will allow you to find the personal data of a person on his web on the web.  True, in order for such information about yourself to be available at the request of the application, you must first give your consent, ticking the corresponding clause of the agreement.  This information was provided by Harmut Neven, the head of the corporation‚Äôs department for image recognition technology. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>  This mobile application will search for information of a person in Google‚Äôs Profiles service, including name, phone number and email address.  Whether the application will show other information, the developers do not yet say.  True, Neven noted that the project team understands the potential danger and that they need to be very careful with all this personal data.

      According to the corporation, the exact release date of the mobile application is still unknown, but work on its development is very active, and the company has all the technical capabilities for the successful implementation of the project.  Perhaps it will not be an independent service, but only one of the functions of existing Google projects.  In addition to information from Google's Profiles, the mobile application will search for images of a person on social networks (in this case, only a search will be carried out on the images posted in the public domain). <br><br>  Work on the creation of serious image recognition technology has been conducted by Google since about 2009, when the corporation bought the company Like.com, which also conducted research in this area.  Google has since received several patents in the field of image recognition with people's faces. <br><br>  Of course, such a technology, figuratively speaking, is a godsend for a spy - but in fact, this application will look for what is available and so, bringing together scattered information into a single whole.  If a person does not want everyone to know about him, or much, he does not post his photos to the public, and does not indicate his home phone number, right?  On the other hand, quite often private information leaks to the Web - for example, friends, colleagues, relatives can put something.  So this is another reason to be more careful on the Web, if you do not want everything to be open to all. <br><br>  Via <a href="http://edition.cnn.com/2011/TECH/mobile/03/31/google.face/">CNN</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/116739/">https://habr.com/ru/post/116739/</a></p>
