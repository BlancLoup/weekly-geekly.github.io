    <h1>  What a miracle, what a wonderful beast? </h1><br><br>  Well, let's see, what is it - Windows Azure Pack?  Well, firstly, it is completely free and available for download in the open.  Secondly, in essence, this is a set of similar technologies of the mechanisms of its older and full-fledged brother - Windows Azure, which is a public cloud from Microsoft.  That's just the Azure Pack is built on a private cloud tandem - <a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-US/evalcenter/dn205286">Windows Server 2012 R2</a> and <a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-US/evalcenter/dn205295">System Center 2012 R2</a> .  The add-in allows you to get an interface that looks virtually no different from Windows Azure, realizing the possibilities of self-service, multi-tenancy (or multi-visibility, if you please) at different levels of service provision - both at the IaaS level and at the PaaS level. <br><br>  If you go into the details, then this is essentially a set of web portals that use the REST API and the SPF (Service Provider Foundation) layer as its implements to manage various infrastructure elements: System Center components, in particular VMM, SQL or MySQL databases, web -IIS sites (essentially at the PaaS level) - this is an example.  If you fully list the functionality, you get the following picture, described below. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/be8/30f/e8b/be830fe8b773e7ac8e36ba0f6a4f7754.png"><br>  <b>Here is the complete list of services provided through Windows Azure Pack today.</b> <br><br>  1) Management portal for administrators - in fact, the interface through which all the configuration of services that can be provided through Windows Azure Pack is made.  In particular, this portal creates and manages private resources from VMM (or public cloud - depending on who the end user is), user accounts - in essence, the role of Tenant Administrator is created in the same VMM, service plans (a plan is a set of services that You can build and present to the user through creating a subscription), set quotas for consumed resources, and also establish billing mechanisms for consumed resources at the expense of third-party components, such as Cloud Cruiser. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/949/842/911/949842911e8b6f55e819ddf3450670dc.png"><br>  <b>This is what a created user and a subscription to Windows Azure Pack associated with it from the point of view of VMM looks like.</b> <br><br>  2) A management portal for users is essentially an interface for end-user consumption of services ‚Äî for example, the task of deploying, monitoring, and managing web sites, virtual machines, or service buses can be implemented through this portal. <br><br>  3) Service management API is essentially a REST API that allows you to integrate Windows Azure portals with third-party solutions, such as billing systems.  Also, this mechanism allows you to transfer the functionality of Windows Azure to customized, own web portals (read - interfaces).  Here the main thing to understand is that you can fully realize all the functionality of Windows Azure Pack on the portal that apparently has nothing in common with it even without it - long live freedom of choice and competitive advantage! <br><br>  4) Virtual machines - in fact, this is the IaaS level in the provision of virtual machines for both Windows and Linux.  This portal includes the possibility of creating a gallery of images of VM, similar to its adult brother, as well as the settings of virtual networks and the scaling area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe deployed components. <br><br>  5) Service Bus (Service Bus) - a service that provides a reliable messaging and data system between distributed applications.  This mechanism operates on a subscription to messages based on requests or topics of publications or subscriptions. <br><br>  6) SQL and MySQL - in fact, it is a service at the PaaS level to provide database instances on the specified platforms, used in conjunction with websites, as a rule.  Here it is important to understand that SQL can be deployed at the IaaS level, i.e.  get a virtual machine with a DBMS, but in this case it is fashionable to say that access is given to a specific database instance with a quota for its size, in other words, a VM with SQL can have many different isolated users at the PaaS level, which do not have access to the VM itself , only to the DBMS, and even then - only to its own instance of the database. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/7a5/ab1/b9f/7a5ab1b9f7020dcd8d411f3fc811ed79.png"><br>  <b>An example of connecting SQL DBMS at the PaaS level in Windows Azure Pack.</b> <br><br>  7) Automation and advanced features - in fact, the portal for creating custom, individual services and their inclusion in the user.  You can, for example, create runbooks to automate workflows and business processes, as well as execute them. <br><br><h1>  Where to get and how to deliver? </h1><br><br>  Probably one of the easiest to install products of all, with whom I had to work. <br>  You need to run our Web Installer on the machine where you plan to deploy the Azure Pack.  First I recommend using the express method - this is when all the roles and components of the Azure Pack are deployed on a single server based on Windows Server 2012/2012 R2. <br>  That's actually a <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/%3Flinkid%3D9832690">link to the installer</a> .  Then simply select all the components and click on Next-&gt; Next-&gt; Next&gt;))))). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a6b/8d3/3af/a6b8d33afa841068065569ed812e02bd.png"><br>  <b>This is what the Windows Azure Pack installer looks like.</b> <br><br>  Just in case - a list of prerequisites for installation: <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ Windows Server 2012 or Windows Server 2012 R2 <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ Microsoft Web Platform Installer 4.6 <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ Microsoft .NET Framework 3.5 Service Pack (SP) 1 <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ Internet Information Services (IIS) 8 or IIS 8.5 <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ .NET Framework 4.5 Extended, with ASP.NET Windows 8 <br><br>  In terms of equipment requirements, the picture is as follows: <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ 8 GB of RAM.  If you are running inside the VM, it is strongly recommended NOT to use dynamic memory. <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ 40 GB of storage space. <br><br>  Since Windows Azure Pack is a web portal, some ports will need access by default, and you will need to open them on your firewall: <br><br>  Admin API (Admin Functions API) <br>  30004 <br><br>  Management portal for administrators (Management portal for administrators) <br>  30091 <br><br>  Authentication site <br>  30071 <br><br>  Configuraton site (Site configuration and configuration) <br>  30101 - Local Subnet <br><br>  Monitoring <br>  30020 <br><br>  MySQL resource provider (MySQL DBMS connection provider) <br>  30012 <br><br>  SQL Server or MySQL resource provider (SQL or MySQL DBMS connection provider) <br>  30010 <br><br>  Tenant API (API for working with user functions - internal) <br>  30005 <br><br>  Tenant public API (API for working with user-defined functions - public) <br>  30006 <br><br>  Management portal for tenants (Management Portal for users) <br>  30081 <br><br>  Usage (Service Portal) <br>  30022 <br><br>  WebAppGallery (Web Application Gallery) <br>  30018 <br><br>  Windows authentication site <br>  30072 <br><br>  Something like this is a common story with WAP (Windows Azure Pack) - I naturally urge to try it yourself, deploy and configure it yourself - and then play with the services and its functions - an extremely interesting activity is coming out in practice!  Successful to you experiments! <br><br>  Ever-inexorable and hot pepper, <br><br>  Fireman <br><br>  George A. Gadzhiev. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/209918/">https://habr.com/ru/post/209918/</a></p>
