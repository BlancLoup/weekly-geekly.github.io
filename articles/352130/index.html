      What is the power of cooperation?  And what secret tools help managers create strong teams? <br><blockquote>  <i>‚ÄúTo lead is not to hinder good people from working‚Äù</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Sergey Kapitsa</i> </blockquote><h2>  What tools are best for team collaboration? </h2><br>  Naturally, any professional tool for a manager and a team is not a panacea. <br><br>  Product managers should think about the quality of communication, starting with interviews, employee's probationary periods, and knowing <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/hygger/blog/351784/">how to brainstorm properly</a> .  Even after a successful release during team building, it is important to think about how to raise the level of team collaboration to a new level. <br><br>  This article describes <b>9 types of tools</b> that will help create a strong team spirit and streamline team workflows.  All of these tools have different goals, some of them are paid, some are free.  Some of them are suitable for all products, and some highly specialized. <br><br>  This list is quite subjective, therefore, after each given example, several alternatives are proposed so that any reader can choose the best for himself from the above: <br><br><ul><li>  Communication tools </li><li>  Project and product management platforms </li><li>  Services for the organization of remote communication and video conferencing </li><li>  Document Services </li><li>  Time tracking tools </li><li>  Database systems </li><li>  Special file sharing tools </li><li>  Internal social networks </li><li>  Tools for layouts and prototypes. </li></ul><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/31c/d10/793/31cd1079320d2884bdc2108a31256658.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h3>  Communication tools </h3><br><h4>  Example: Slack </h4><br>  <a href="https://slack.com/">Slack</a> is a real-time chat service that has gained rapid popularity after being distributed to Silicon Valley companies. <br>  The service works on the basis of channels and includes voice and video calls, although these Slack components are not as popular as text chat rooms.  Here you can add pictures, emoji, GIF, share documents and organize group chats. <br><br>  <b>How does Slack work?</b> <br><br>  You can use Channels as chats or public streams.  This can be done in just a few clicks.  You can also write directly to a specific contact, attach documents and files for him. <br><br>  The ‚ÄúPrivate Groups‚Äù option allows you to organize conversations with specific team members.  You can invite developers, sales professionals, HRov and so on. <br>  All content in Slack is searchable from a single search box.  You can also use the help of the Slackbot bot, which can give you more information, remind you of urgent matters and be useful on other issues. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d1c/d0f/94f/d1cd0f94fefcca80262d807a4f29ac97.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <i>Alternatives: HipChat, Microsoft Teams</i> <br><br><h3>  Tools for project and product management </h3><br><h4>  Example: Hygger.io </h4><br>  <a href="https://hygger.io/%3Futm_source%3Dhabrahabrarticle%26utm_medium%3Dlink%26utm_campaign%3Dteam%2520collaboration%2520tools">Hygger</a> is a complete product management platform for growing companies.

It helps to organize meetings and presentations without a special separate planning tool.  You can send invitations to any team member and coordinate actions right in the sidebar. <br><br>  Individual chats allow team members to collaborate in a group project, chat with colleagues, customers or other team members, make changes to Google docks, etc. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/45b/6cb/624/45b6cb6249ad4b55cbcd35326d892016.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <i>Alternatives: Skype, Amazon Chime, Join.me</i> <br><br><h3>  Document Services </h3><br><h4>  Example: OneNote </h4><br>  <a href="https://site.onenote.com/%3Fpublic%3D1%26wdorigin%3Dondcauth2%26wdorigin%3Dondc">OneNote</a> will be useful if you need to control the movement of documents and share them with your team.  This is a kind of collaborative notebook that makes it easy to distribute a large amount of data among team members. <br><br>  OneNote is more than just working with documents.  Many companies use it as an ideal tool for project management in teams.  This is a free tool.  Using different sections and OneNote pages, you can provide your team members with relevant information at any time that is convenient for you.  Here you can create multiple sections and sub-pages for storing important data. <br>  OneNote allows you to share information from any device. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/3a1/0f3/169/3a10f31698b88d22c40308dca540db1e.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <i>Alternatives: Evernote, Quip, G Suite</i> <br><br><h3>  Time Tracking Tools </h3><br><h4>  Example: Hubstaff </h4><br>  Want to successfully manage workflows and performance of remote team members?  <a href="https://hubstaff.com/">Hubstaff</a> is one of the most successful tools that simplifies the processes of a product manager and adds transparency to team collaboration. <br><br>  Using this time tracking service, you can set time or cost limits for your projects, as well as limits for each team member.

This tool helps to organize teams and centralize all the information needed to synchronize actions. <br><br>  Confluence offers a user-friendly interface where you can create meeting notes, set up project plans or product requirements, use templates, write comments, and get feedback.  All in one place.  Here you can also use add-ins, such as team calendars to schedule events or discuss issues and voting. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/cf0/395/c28/cf0395c282394f4cbda83ee463e6a98a.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <i>Alternatives: Guru, Bloomfire, Nuclino, Crowdbase</i> <br><br><h3>  Tools for sharing information (file sharing) </h3><br><h4>  Example: Dropbox </h4><br>  Popular online storage is used by more than 500 million users worldwide.  <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/">Dropbox</a> allows you not only to store all your files together in one place, but also to share them with other team members. <br><br>  You can send links by email or chat rooms, leave feedback and share access to your documents from any device. <br><br>  Dropbox is free for individual use, but you have to pay for a business plan to get more space or more access. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/42a/572/dde/42a572dde494164889cea3c3b37f7c93.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <i>Alternatives: Hightail, MediaFire, Tresorit, ShareFile</i> <br><br><h3>  Internal social networks </h3><br><h4>  Example: Yammer </h4><br>  You can say that this is an example from the "past century."  But, in fact, <a href="https://www.yammer.com/">Yammer</a> is one of the first social networks created specifically for the internal needs of office teams.  The service is popular today no less than before.  Team members can post updates and chat in groups and channels using this tool. <br><br>  Three main advantages of using Yammer for internal or even external interaction: ease of use, the availability of a mobile version and the possibility of cooperation with external users. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b83/efa/d4f/b83efad4fde93b213c4ed1a0c1cd8351.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <i>Alternatives: Jive-n, Facebook workplace</i> <br><br><h3>  Services for layouts and prototypes </h3><br><h4>  Example: Marvel </h4><br>  <a href="https://marvelapp.com/">Marvel is</a> known worldwide as one of the easiest programs for business layouts.
