Today we will talk about a very important project for me.  But for a start, a brief introduction. <br><br>  I am writing as it is.  My account on Habr√© is already more than 3 years old and I know perfectly well how any requests are negatively perceived in relation to the community. <br><br>  But today I am ready to exchange your loyalty for my participation in the life of Habr.  If the video and the text below you do not like, or you personally have a negative to me or to the Trailers Studio, then please minus me, not the post.  Here is my karma to make it easier for you: <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/nos_s_dest/" class="user_link">Nos_S_Dest</a> .

        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>

      <br>
      Karma was earned for a long time and I do not have duplicate accounts.  If I go to minus, I promise not to disturb Habr in any way.  A lot of karma, but you are not enough, everything is in your hands. <br><br>  Now to the point. <br><br>  In 2009 we made 2 social videos: <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/my_business/79428/">Officials Clip</a> and <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/my_business/79613/">Santa Claus Clip</a> .  Now I want to present you a new video. <br><br>  Unfortunately, in fact, we did not have time to launch it.  When publishing the video on December 30th we almost sign a death sentence to him.  He just does not have time to disperse, and after the New Year, the distribution stops (tested in practice). <br><br>  Therefore, I beg your help.  The fate of our future projects depends on how this video spreads.  Publish it in blogs, write about it twitter, in social.  networks on your sites.  Send it on Skype and ICQ, ask your friends to publish it.  We want to continue the work that started this movie, without you we can not cope. <br><br>  Many thanks to all who worked with us on the video. <br><br>  Clip Santa Claus 2: The Answer of the Old Man: <br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/kHdyunqBvec&amp;xid=25657,15700021,15700186,15700191,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhg4AvXPiUm_3WCxGs0dMT0L9zSNZg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  Official announcement: <br>  New Year is an excellent opportunity to make changes in your life, break with old bad habits and start something new and useful.  Go from stating facts to some actions.  For two years we have been complaining about the chaos and chaos in the country.  We expose for two years and ask the authorities to punish, help, reward.  Youtube will soon burst on the number of messages, appeals and appeals. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  We are waiting for someone up there, in the Kremlin or somewhere else, to hear us, come to the rescue, restore order.  But, if you think about it, aren't we too old to continue to believe in Santa Claus, who by magic fulfills our desires?  So why be surprised that the government treats us like children, telling tales and spoiling sweets on holidays?  If only we did not distract her from important adult activities that do not concern us, and in general is not our business? <br><br>  Let the New Year's Eve is a time of magic, but can it be enough to hope for a miracle?  We are able not only to shout about our problems, we are quite able to start some of them to solve.  Together.  There is enough space on Youtube for advice and answers to questions and guidelines for action.  And let at first not everything will turn out beautifully and effectively.  There are no rules here.  You can only start doing and learning from your own experience. <br><br>  In the third series of The Lord of the Rings, there is a very beautiful scene in which the inhabitants of the besieged city ask for help by lighting a signal light.  At the distant peaks of the mountains, they notice him and light their own - and so on, along a chain.  This fire, from one signal point to another, passes through the mountains until it reaches the addressee.  Now we can see something similar in the network - when the signal starts its journey from one computer to another, until it finds someone who can help.  We are only required not to interrupt the circuit.  What we, in particular, will do on the bidlo.tv website, where we undertake to collect not only stories about problems, but also tips on how to solve them. <br><br>  After all, our country is not Putin with Medvedev, not blue flashers, not hundreds of kilometers of oil and gas pipelines.  Our country is you and me.  Simple and not very people.  Power will treat us like small children exactly until it sees that we have grown up.  We are able to make independent decisions and are not afraid to implement them.  And ‚ÄúSanta Claus Clip 2‚Äù is not a virus and not an advertisement.  It is we who light our signal fire and, with bated breath, we wait ... </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/110984/">https://habr.com/ru/post/110984/</a></p>
