Today, as you already understood by the title, I will conduct a virtual tour of the Moscow office of one of the largest mobile operators in Russia, Beeline. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/39ae18cd/1c2bd690/486043ea/45dc4ff9.jpg"><br><br>  Carefully - under the cut a stack of 60 photos (easter eggs x8), some of which can cause acute bouts of nostalgia. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The office is located near the metro station "Novoslobodskaya", a five minute walk.  In total, the company employs about 30,000 people, 6,000 of whom work in Moscow.  The main Moscow office (it is called the headquarters) employs about 2,000 people.

      Generally, <b>Ekaterina Turtseva</b> ( <a href="http://geektimes.ru/users/ekaterinaturtseva/" class="user_link">Ekaterina</a> <b>Turtseva</b> , Brand Communications Manager in Russia) <b>initially</b> invited me to the <b>Mobio Lab</b> - their so-called usability-laboratory, but in the end I could not deny myself the pleasure of walking around the office. <br><br>  I admit - I didn‚Äôt even remember who works on which floor, and this information is hardly interesting to you.  Therefore, the order of the photos will be according to the route we took.  And at first there was the very ‚Äúlaboratory‚Äù. <br><br><h2>  <font color="fabd00">‚ñà</font> <font color="000000">Mobio Lab</font> </h2><br>  So.  2007, autumn - the marketing and sales department decides to create a new division - product design service, the main task of which will be taking care of the user at all stages of his interaction with the services of Beeline.  And the Mobio Lab in the Moscow office has become nothing more than the result of the work of this unit - in this usually unusual place the analysis of the user suitability and competitiveness of all Beeline products, as well as the design of convenient and understandable interfaces for the company's services. <br><br>  The main task of the laboratory is to improve the usability of products, services and services - this is mainly done through the involvement of real users in testing.  Their response allows not only to create something new, but also to improve / simplify / optimize the existing one - not only emerging functions and prototypes (being at the testing stage), but also already existing products are analyzed. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/547f0d87/ae5d5045/8be2fe21/d6c15b68.jpg"><br><br>  Experts in the company are good, but if you fight for the client (and in the conditions of service competition, this is exactly what you need to do), then you need to ‚Äúgo in their shoes‚Äù - for this, the laboratory has been divided into several sectors that are as close to reality as possible. furnishings: office, home, cafe and cinema. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/f305c5ab/e70de2e9/82634782/076a2c10.jpg"><br><br>  In a cafe, the most usual cafe setting - tea, coffees, high chairs and tables, the <s>smell of pasties</s> - no one forbids you to really take and make yourself some kind of drink or take it from the fridge: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/702b2a54/afe67988/c8a41d8c/9ea59005.jpg"><br><br>  There are many similar cardboard characters in the office - two weeks have passed since visiting the office, and they continue to dream about me. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/631/870/c82/631870c82a05d059126e6fb8518ae2b6.jpg"><br><br>  On the bar counter there is a source of warm tube sound: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/f8c526c3/dd32c00c/ff0914f1/1212281d.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/f352b265/f005cdbe/2f7e2d2b/d4afa8f3.jpg"><br><br>  Literally behind the partition, home comfort reigns - a laminate, a soft sofa opposite a widescreen TV, a wall with orders and awards: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/bbe45d18/6039be26/de4a9d2c/14148cc1.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/f0d05c7c/16392711/b7a2d0ec/aebc1cb7.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/3a8cac1a/6d6e6c41/4ef61708/eb24707a.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/d7fdaa48/067194ca/85fe9f98/5adbb13e.jpg"><br><br>  Even through the partition - a typical office setting: a table-chair, a system unit with a monitor or a laptop, a printer with an uninterruptible power supply and many, many sticky leaves: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/90ba609c/095b1dbc/185a75b4/d8cbabe2.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/ae0c28a6/98e8cf2c/e25fdafb/6c2ead68.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/40e3cd1c/8e96e3fa/755d7c3c/2731ee7c.jpg"><br><br>  There is also a test payment terminal (exactly the same as it was in my store in front of the house - and I‚Äôm thinking where it went): <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/7521acf7/68561d53/951d8501/f2be347d.jpg"><br><br>  By the way, for the first time in my life I saw live an expensive device called eyetracker - special pieces with infrared sensors that allow you to track where the user is looking.  In other words, unlike subjective ‚Äúconvenient / inconvenient‚Äù, this thing gives a unique opportunity to measure ‚Äúconvenience‚Äù (interface) quantitatively - at the <b>404fest</b> conference one of the speakers gave an interesting report on this topic (regarding CMS systems) - I would give a lot for the opportunity to test Habr at such a level to make it even better. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/4bd6ddee/83188af7/20b426fd/250ca479.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/3447a062/b72aa8f7/67a577e6/b3292032.jpg"><br><br>  All the "rooms" are divided by decorative partitions ... <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/9a5fa2a1/f1b9eedb/2b1b0bd1/5be4794e.jpg"><br><br>  ... and are located around the glass "middle", from where users are monitored for <s>guinea-pigs</s> .  Outside is a mirrored glass wall: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/c5b31d98/cca2ac51/a3c8cedf/3d9991d4.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/e997bcca/0327f742/54817135/c7034ea3.jpg"><br><br>  And inside - the dream of a spy.  Panoramic view of all rooms, a multitude of sensors, control of light and sound in rooms, camera control (to display the user's image or what is shown to him on the screens at the moment), the ability to carry on a dialogue with a test participant ‚Äî anything you like. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/c38d08b2/4c9490c5/8f56864f/15d70b4a.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/51860383/9e780a44/a965432e/66575620.jpg"><br><br>  Accordingly, by measuring certain data (analysis of which helps evaluate the convenience of certain services for the end user), you can make your products better.  Well, for example, there is a confused advertisement <s>(at MTS and Megaphone, ahah)</s> - you look at it and do not understand what it is all about - in the video all the time something is distracting.  But it is worth watching this video with the ‚Äúaim‚Äù of the eytreker, how everything will fall into place - this way you can focus on the ‚Äúright‚Äù places ... yes, anything can be done - there is already a whole science.  And this approach may be somewhat inhuman on the part of the user, but what to do is the company's quite understandable desire to strive to bring their products and services to a new level.  So I think the approach is very correct. <br><br><h2>  <font color="fabd00">‚ñà</font> <font color="000000">Workflow</font> </h2><br>  After visiting the laboratory, we decided to take a walk on the floors, to see who works how - a kind of volatile control.  I was not taken aback - everyone was working :) The situation is rather quiet, although I would not say that there are few people there. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/5bf73546/51ce5255/eb4240bd/c88498af.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/2f565b24/89af6e40/91d19e4d/c4022956.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/f863fd94/dd278fa4/c308b5e8/3ba54f2b.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/02d3ba42/c60d2b8e/75e7d5f3/05400f26.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/6072ec4a/10af8ebb/2722032f/c0298510.jpg"><br><br>  His Majesty <b>Artyom Minaev</b> (Head of Public Relations in the CIS countries) - it was a chance meeting with him that marked the beginning of my acquaintance with the company: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/3fd002d8/746368e9/d6a2a3b4/3c3506b0.jpg"><br><br>  Once, when I cleaned up my room, I noticed that all-all-all horizontal surfaces were filled with something ‚Äî as it turned out later, this is a completely natural property of human behavior.  So in the company of Beeline - probably, you have already paid attention to the number of all sorts of black and yellow stuff that lives on the bright side.  In any free space, there are some bees, wasps, bumblebees, bears, giraffes, scarves, felt boots, umbrellas, mugs and watering cans - what could they have there? <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/b19971ae/de72376e/b2630118/69502aef.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/859f3430/7adfaa58/13fec1ac/17043d93.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/939dfdec/ac7e8a3d/a025533b/69753396.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/39209898/5d24cca9/40b688f9/9f694c55.jpg"><br><br>  New bees on the couch with the old logo: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/bc6217dc/fabe7b71/892438da/5619d822.jpg"><br><br>  Kote: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/0c1d3eb6/24376f4a/6847b8b7/00b24de7.jpg"><br><br>  <i>- ‚ÄúAnd I have a kote too!‚Äù</i> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/3293f01f/71df7438/b3aacbfe/cc581f79.jpg"><br><br>  An elegant example of fine trolling: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/8aa56555/2a747d1c/5b6cd33f/bc51c801.jpg"><br><br>  Avoski with invites (s): <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/6d32122f/4ee54854/77e961b0/3fac3d4c.jpg"><br><br>  Giant guitar and hipster old school keda, in which, I give a tooth, someone sometimes spends the night! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/65fe0dc3/d8efebc8/8d2f028a/7c369605.jpg"><br><br>  And on one of the desktops, I noticed a lively and fluffy something in the same corporate colors: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/443e37cb/086d22c9/4c961ea8/16fff6c6.jpg"><br><br>  In general, I will honestly say: for the first time I see such corporate spirit, unity of style and variety of decisions - a serious approach is immediately visible, which causes respect. <br><br>  I was equally pleased with the ‚Äúmuseum of technology‚Äù created by the staff of the company, which is a rack with several dozen devices that only the wealthiest people could afford at one time: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/74341068/46f2fd26/70e7f880/e3ae10a2.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/56eeb768/cd19e9dc/e9d2143c/068ea8bc.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/b2166afb/a52b3c40/b6f41a1e/a57e489c.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/2985c268/c29bff8d/b0b2caba/cc983ff8.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/7d66d3ed/e0f57d48/f1a53cc9/4a145966.jpg"><br><br>  It is now you can buy a SIM card or phone in any transition, but before that it was all strictly: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/271a3e56/0e2cb746/0a7351cc/7835d07c.jpg"><br><br>  I wonder what the average number of subscribers in the "address book" was the owners of such handsets? <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/f199e20f/247c42aa/f278aa74/ad5890f0.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/a06a1890/a3673043/8b6b9522/840a4d3d.jpg"><br><br>  On the topmost (on the eighth) floor it is noticeably quieter, and the setting is more impressive - wood, leather and no ‚Äúknick-knacks‚Äù.  As it is easy to guess, the company's management lives there, however, on the day of the excursion I did not find anyone :) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/f33eb899/cf58a5b9/629001de/5aacea06.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/767a3e9e/aed6f182/6007da8a/871f7405.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/0b9a7713/8ae56596/5d74f63e/cb2bf389.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/a281a68c/70fa045d/fafedaa2/7ad9ae5f.jpg"><br><br>  On the floor there are several meeting rooms - each with a large table. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/661c5fe8/e5c64faf/2f9ab442/aaa0df8e.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/62cdf3bf/a057d396/ef3e4d5e/0d81371c.jpg"><br><br>  The office of the former head (Alexander Izosimov) - I am surprised that he is transparent. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/0f86dcad/d7a37d6a/29ece9bf/300299d1.jpg"><br><br>  At the very end of the floor there is a kind of rest room - in the very center there is a kind of glass fireplace (or stove?), And around - sofas and armchairs. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/5e862e3f/12e1e5f6/50304eb4/51eaf66a.jpg"><br><br>  Everything is Feng Shui - I would give a lot for the opportunity to work there at a laptop, sitting comfortably on a cold winter evening, drinking hot mulled wine and listening to the crackle of the fire against the background of howling nasty gusts of wind outside the window. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/d0db27af/786adee9/c478af40/022e2bb9.jpg"><br><br>  If desired, among the panoramic windows you can find access to the roof, from where a beautiful view of Moscow opens up.  I would give a lot for the opportunity to work there behind a laptop, lolling in the hot summer on a lounger, drinking icy mojito and not hearing the nasty bibling of tinted cayenne through headphones :) By the way, sometimes the company spends various activities on the roof opportunity! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/3371bc1d/5f15d2fc/2a75d0d1/86b2a616.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/0e040191/ef7bb806/8e0ac128/6d287c53.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/ad7bda7f/c0661c94/dae935b2/507e1fcf.jpg"><br><br>  In this photo you can see a piece of the neighboring building, in which Beeline is also located. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/238d0fce/cd1e5180/0d78292e/0e5b3772.jpg"><br><br><h2>  <font color="fabd00">‚ñà</font> <font color="000000">The end</font> </h2><br>  A large number of company employees perform huge amounts of work every day - it is logical that all this requires a lot of space.  In this case, it is there, it is being spent quite rationally and very comfortable - now I once again looked through the pictures and, perhaps, would have given the remnants of ‚Äúa lot‚Äù for ‚Äúworking‚Äù;) <br><br>  I want to thank a separate item to all the company employees involved in creating one of the most interesting corporate blogs on Habr√© - I read every post from cover to cover! <br><br>  Tired but satisfied, we returned home. <br><br>  - <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/office/130518/">Office Odnoklassniki</a> <br>  - <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/office/124347/">Office of the company Vkontakte</a> <br>  - <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/intel/blog/82533/">Office of Intel</a> (in Moscow) <br>  - <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/intel/blog/106911/">Office of Intel</a> (in Nizhny Novgorod) <br>  - <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/office/91646/">Boomburum office</a> <br>  - <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/p/83155/">Data center "Oversan-Mercury"</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/133358/">https://habr.com/ru/post/133358/</a></p>
