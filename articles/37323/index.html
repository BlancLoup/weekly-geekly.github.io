  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Open Source Brand. Principles of creation</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  via <a href="http://ad28.ru/">AD28</a> <br><br>  I am becoming more and more convinced that consciousness is still primary, and the body is just a tool.  However, there are often times when our primary needs are put above spiritual content.  Consumer lifestyle makes us psychologically vulnerable to commodity starvation.  The desire to acquire and use becomes decisive, although elements of social regression cannot be overlooked in this phenomenon.  And if you pay attention to how much it became painful for a person to share his redundant acquisitions with others around him, then it will become quite alarming. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The idea of ‚Äã‚Äãpublic property, which has not found a safe haven for so long, seems to have taken its place, reaching the minds of a particular type of Internet users.  It's amazing how people guard their chests!  But the really valuable substance - intellectual property - is ready to share with brother, matchmaker and neighbor. <br><br>  Unfortunately, the body takes its toll, and in the fantasies of marketing technologists, earning schemes are born even on the human instincts of undivided possession ...

      <a href="http://blogbook.ru/2008/04/03/brend-s-otkryityim-kodom/">Anton Popov's article ‚ÄúOpen Source Brand.</a>  <a href="http://blogbook.ru/2008/04/03/brend-s-otkryityim-kodom/">The principles of creating a brand in social networks</a> caused me a lot of negative experiences!  First of all, its meaningless stirring, not related to each other terms.  But this article (as a presentation and a report on E-target 2008) pushed me to think about a world without exploitation, poverty and intrusive marketing procedures. <br><br>  I‚Äôll start with fundamental misunderstandings ... is it really enough for brand makers to apply the term ‚Äú <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source_branding">Open Source Brand</a> ‚Äù to their creation just to organize a company blog, open a Facebook page and post handmade videos on youtube, thus creating the appearance of openness and dependence on ordinary Internet users? <br><br>  I would like to give a small list of sophisms that I don‚Äôt have much to say, but in the context of the statement ‚ÄúThere is and is increasing the number of web 2.0 services ...‚Äù sounded weighty in the mouths of the head of the agency ‚Äú <a href="http://www.remarkable.ru/">Rare Mark</a> ‚Äù: <br>  - open source brand <br>  - ‚Äúcode‚Äù of your brand <br>  - the company simply will not manage to ‚Äúclose all points of contact‚Äù <br>  - all people are equal <br>  Etc. <br><br>  In the demagogy of the Russian-speaking speakers who popularize the so-called <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMO">Social Media Marketing</a> , I have the most incomprehensible strong desire to disguise manipulation technologies, the desire to build an open information space.  The whole concept of SMM is this: ‚ÄúNow you can screw up a lot and wipe the dirty footprint will be too troublesome.  But you can declare yourself for free without the help of the media! ‚Äù <br><br>  So loved by these ‚Äúspecialists‚Äù new media are denigrated every day by the distribution of vulgar video contents.  This reflects the desire of socially responsible brands to convert the attention of enthusiastic Internet observers to eating hamburgers, smoking cigarettes and drinking beer. <br><br>  By encouraging creative pesticides, brands make consumers myopic, dragging them into the cycle of market exchange.  But people of the future have little freedom of choice, they are ready for the freedom of creation and management. <br><br>  The concept of <a href="http://www.opensource.org/">Open Source</a> , until recently, was applied only to software.  However, in the traditions associated with this phenomenon, we can certainly consider the social background of the precomputer period of our history.  After all, people invest their limited resources to create a quality product and at the same time, they often do not have the opportunity to compensate the time spent with a financial equivalent.  Agree that it is not quite in the market style? <br><br>  Is it possible that in the future trademarks will be created using ‚Äúopen standards‚Äù?  It will be rather unusual to play by the rules of the Internet in real life, but the result can revolutionize the socio-economic landscape in a revolutionary way.  Product creators will be concerned not with questions of competition and communication with target audiences, but with problems of social order, not productively satisfying one's interests, but effective provision of their own and social needs. <br><br>  <strong>What signs will have a full-fledged Open Source Brand?</strong> <br><br>  1. No restrictions on participation in the creation of a brand, its distribution and the receipt of income from the sale of products released under this brand. <br>  2. The absence of restrictions on the receipt of information by participants about the brand performance <br>  3. Modifications of the brand should have the mandatory features of the original version of the brand. <br>  4. No restrictions on brand modification. <br>  5. The presence of an independent group of persons empowered with unobtrusive control over the distribution of the brand and the resolution of disputes related to the distribution and modification of the original version of the brand. <br>  6. Non-discrimination against individuals or groups. <br>  7. No restrictions on the scope of the brand. <br>  8. The rights assigned to this brand should be extended to all participants without the need for them to issue any additional license. <br>  9. The rights attributed to this brand apply to all products released under this brand or its modifications. <br>  10. There is no requirement that Close Source products, distributed in a set with Open Source products, also represent Open Source products. <br><br>  You can find a lot of insurmountable obstacles that will stand in the way of an open business model.  This is competition and the problem of balancing pricing and demand.  It is possible to prove the inconsistency of the whole concept, but only with the help of capitalist ideology.  From the point of view of the modern interpretation of the market, this model is utopian!  But economic paradigms are not absolute truths.  The main problem is in those stereotypes that have grown into the nerve cells of the modern consumer.  Hope remains only for the next generation.  I think that the informational pressure will create in modern children absolute immunity to the authoritarianism of the market rules of survival and they will have to look for other reference points.  I hope that the main positions of their picture of the world will take cooperation, responsibility and empathy. <br><br>  Ps.
