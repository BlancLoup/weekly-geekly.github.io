  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Psychology and digital reality</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The days fly by behind the monitor screen, like a series of popular short sitcoms like ‚ÄúHow I Met Your Mother‚Äù or ‚ÄúThe Big Bang Theory‚Äù, it is vital for us to constantly spin, do something.  Sometimes it creates the feeling that there is nothing more around, the reality ends beyond the borders of the screen, and there outside the window is lifeless cold and not understandable vanity.  Of course, the computer is a great achievement, but also harmful to the psyche too.  Because of the tendency to systematize everything, I often notice how I acquire stupid habits associated with software or hardware, they are soon becoming obsolete and no longer needed, as these habits are a significant part of the life of any <s>computer</s> geek.  This is the framework of life that modernity dictates. But, as it seems to me, this is all the screen behind which real life and real experience are hidden.  All this is in the form of art in digital form, and technical progress has given it to us now, but how far is digital culture far from reality? <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h5>  General thoughts </h5><br>  Fortunately, it became quantified long before the sound and the picture really resembled reality.  Everyone knows such parameters as the number of megapixels, the frequency range, the maximum brightness / contrast, in general the objective parameters on which the perception of virtual reality should be built.  By the way, in this case we will understand the imprinted reality as virtual reality, but otherwise it is also real, just in this aspect we are interested in reality in bits and bytes - it is virtual.  Moreover, all this is true both for the image and for the sound.  Between them a lot in common at the level of perception.  But how to draw a parallel between quantitative parameters and qualitative, emotional? <br><br>  If you look purely theoretical, then with a certain accuracy of data storage (note, well, there are a lot of megapixels per inch) and playback with precise precision of the impression, i.e.  emotional response can be achieved very accurate.  In the sense of correlating with the original, because  different people still feel differently.  Of course, without faith in the existence of this interactivity, nothing works, but believing a person is not as difficult as many, for example, believe in startups. <br><br>  Another aspect is the place.  The playback location is always different from where everything is happening.  This is normal even in terms of the technology itself.  Another thing is efficiency.  If you watch the video passing by the old TV set on the computer market - this is one thing, the impression there is the market in the first place, the cinema in the second.  If, however, in the cinema is completely different - a complete immersion, even artificial, because  you understand that everything happens for fun.  Therefore, concentration of attention is a fine line in perception not so much by the senses as by consciousness.  Everything is complicated by the choice in our time.

      Let's look at this aspect from the other side - the place largely determines our emotional state and the state of consciousness too.  So creating a virtual profile for the environment, we manage consciousness.  This can be a theme for the operating system or all the walls hung with LCD panels, this does not change the essence.  It is only important to understand that reality goes beyond the edges of the monitor.  No, not only via utp cables and fiber, but also visually, audibly, etc.  In many ways, the charm of Apple's devices lies in this, this is work with the space that the engineers spent.  You look at it and immediately understand that it is cool, but you still do not understand why. <br><br>  But what about the sound?  It influences as much as any stimulus, like a bright light or color.  In general, the incentive is a very capacious concept.  Stimuli depend on both sound frequency and timbre.  Noteworthy here I find the perception of the bass in different audio systems.  In modern reality, many perceive the hum at mid-low frequencies (100-200 Hz) as "bass".  They can be loud and swing, while clear bass is not loud, but very powerful, you can only feel it with your body. <br><br>  Timbre is much more important.  This is the nature of the sound that can be perceived subconsciously.  However, it changes during playback.  In fact, you are not listening to what is on the carrier, but what is being reproduced from this carrier, along with isoteric metaphysical and any information that you pay attention to.  The speaker may not shout at all, and the distortions will make a growl out of it.  These moments are not noticeable to the consciousness, which still perceives symbolic information (100% is true for programmers), this all falls on the subconscious perception. <br><br><h5>  In custody </h5><br>  Days fly by in artificial sounds, scenes from films, in an environment that has lost its natural meaning.  This is the path to the development of a new meaning of life and life.  Our task is to find ways to understand and control these elements that crowd out our own real experience.  The human psyche is like a plant on a windowsill, wrapped around a wand along which it grows.  It takes the form of the surrounding information space.  At a minimum, this is an occasion to remember periodically about the beauty of one‚Äôs own inner world, and to think about the digital reality that surrounds us. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/140822/">https://habr.com/ru/post/140822/</a></p>
