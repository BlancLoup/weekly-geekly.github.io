  <section class="page js-page"><h1>A note on how to sit in front of the computer.</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Most of us, including you,% username%, spend a lot of time in a sitting position in front of the monitor.  Many people at the same time do physical exercises and work out in the gym - this solves the problem, but only partially.  Sitting at all is bad (unnatural) for a long time, but it is wrong to sit at all wrongly.  Since most of us cannot give up long meetings, we will talk about how to sit and sit comfortably and properly, so that our eyes, back and arms do not hurt. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  It is important to say that there is no definite prescription that would suit everyone without exception, and many questions are individual.  The main thing is not to ignore them and not hush up - then you will achieve a result, otherwise you are probably waiting for: <br>  1. Myopia. <br>  2. Curvature of the spine. <br>  3. Pain in the hands. <br><br>  First, let's deal with the details of our seat, in the train of life.  Then I will talk about some tricks and exercises. <br><br><h4>  Table selection </h4><br>  The table is very important, much depends on it.  Too narrow a table will not allow a monitor far enough to put the monitor away from the face; too low a table will make it curl like a Quasimodo. <br>  Looking through the catalogs of modern furniture stores I want to talk obscenities.  It feels like tables make for dwarfs living in a dog kennel.  As a result, I sit at the table of the 50s, 130 cm in length, <b>90 cm in width</b> , and 60 cm in height, my height is 178. This wooden table had to be repaired and strengthened, for now it is tightly standing where better than modern.  I advise you to be more attentive to the old tables, do not throw them away, it is better to repair them, and cheaper, by the way.  If you don‚Äôt have your own - you can find a table in good hands or for a nominal fee with self-delivery - such announcements are not uncommon on the Internet. <br>  Of course, modern and amiss, if there is a free amount, you can go to a decent furniture store.

      Choose what you like, but if the interior allows, be <i>sure to</i> take a <i>wide one</i> - 90 cm. Just right.  The question of height is quite individual - it depends on your height, but I advise you to take a stock from a knee of 2-2.5 fists set under the table. <br><br><h4>  Monitor selection </h4><br>  Frankly speaking, big monitors are cool, I advise you to take <b>from 23 "</b> , I have Samsung SyncMaster P2370, it is perfectly visible from afar. If you now have a small monitor until you try a big one, you will not understand, I did not understand either. It is very important to adjust the brightness so so that it would not be unpleasant to the eyes, even very close, but at the same time, so that you do not have to strain your eyes and peer. I settled on the parameters: brightness - 12, contrast - 75, clarity - 100. <br><br><h4>  Seat selection </h4><br>  For the last two years I have been sitting exclusively on a fitball with a diameter of 65 cm. For an average of 10 hours.  Cool and very convenient, I advise you to try.  Cheap and angry.  My fitball cost 1650 rubles. It is less than any normal chair. <br>  In addition, he has such useful qualities as portability (you can take with you on a trip in a deflated form), you can swim with it, you can kick with anger (just look at the corners of the furniture, do not fall), you can swing (jump) . <br>  Unlike the chair, the fitball does not resist your movements, and turns on the floor when you change your body position.  It is very difficult to sit on the fifth point, even if you sit for a very long time, because it not only bends under your weight, but also crushes in response, therefore the vessels are in good shape and there is no effect of blood stagnation, as is the case with the hard surface of the seat. <br>  Also, <b>fitball corrects the posture</b> , because, sitting on it, you need to try very hard if you are trying to bend your back. <br><br>  If you bought a fitball, and you are uncomfortable to sit - this means you are very lucky with the purchase, and it is just for you.  This means you especially need to sit on it - when your posture is corrected, you will feel comfortable on it. <br><br><h4>  Back exercises </h4><br>  Our back constantly needs a warm-up, and we are very grateful for it. <br><br>  With a table seat, it looks like this: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/232563a4/e650cc6e/1e60ac30/9dc53726.png"><br><br>  Exercises shown in the figure are useful for the back and abdomen, they can be done without looking up from the computer.  You can ‚Äúmove out‚Äù with your feet under the table, while continuing to watch a movie, or just look at the monitor. <br>  You can also lean back like this: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/257a194d/dfcb1df6/96f3404b/e05ce135.png"><br><br>  And touch the floor with your hands. <br>  Such exercises can be repeated at least every 15-20 minutes, there will be no harm from them. <br><br><h4>  Eye exercises </h4><br>  If you look into the distance all the time, then after some time you will stop seeing well up close.  And if all the time to look at objects at close range, then you will stop seeing distant objects.  This is because the muscles in our eyes are not a bit different from any others, and when the eye needs to focus - shrink or stretch - muscle strength is needed.  When the muscles cease to tense regularly, they weaken, and the eye stops focusing correctly, hence a blurred image appears as in photographs, where objects are not in focus. <br>  To avoid such problems, it is necessary to look into the distance, look over to close objects, and then again into the distance. <br>  If you have already developed myopia / hyperopia, I can advise you to watch the lectures of Zhdanov V. G. or go to a session. <br><br>  <b>Do not sit at the computer in poor light and do not read!</b> <br>  Turn on the light first, then the monitor.  Turn off the monitor first and then the light. <br>  The fact is that our eyes catch the light with the help of the pupils, and they can narrow and expand.  When there is a lot of light, they narrow, reducing their sensitivity, when there is little - they expand, capture more light and then it is better seen in the semi-darkness.  After all, you noticed that if you turn off the light, you will first see badly, and then ‚Äúyour eyes will get used to the darkness‚Äù - this is just the pupils dilated.  And when you get up in the morning, your eyes will first be cut from the light, this is because in the dream the pupils are dilated and too sensitive for daylight.  It is worth noting that the expanded state of the pupil is natural, and in this position the eye rests at rest.  Squeezing the pupil is an effort. <br>  When you look at the monitor or read in the dark, the pupils are dilated and the light causes them great damage! <br><br>  The monitor is better to put away from the face, for this you need a wide table.  Also, I advise him to move during the day, when you want to move closer, when you want further. <br><br>  Gently rub your eyes with your palms - palming really helps. <br><br><h4>  Conclusion </h4><br>  I hope I managed to draw your attention to the problem, despite the simplicity of the theses in this article.  The goal was precisely this, so do not blame me for not discovering America. <br>  I will be glad to comments and tips! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/87919/">https://habr.com/ru/post/87919/</a></p>
