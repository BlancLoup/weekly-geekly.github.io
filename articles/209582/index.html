Technology and magic</a> <br>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/209616/">Role-playing technology.</a>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/209616/">Part 3.

However, interactions on RI magical are not limited.  Now there are a lot of technogenic games in which the technique itself plays a very important role. <br><br>  We list the situations in which modern technology can become part of the gameplay: <br><ul><li>  Igrotechnic engineering </li><li>  Igrotechnic process modeling </li><li>  Igrotechnic communication </li><li>  Technical and technological objects and artifacts </li></ul><br>  Consider them in more detail.  Often, in sci-fi scenarios, the situation is when the heroes need to restore damaged information systems, power units or communication systems in order to deal with devilry on the location, send a message about themselves to the center, or simply survive.  The same situation can be a great start for the game, or part of it. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Spare parts for the destroyed systems and technical information on their restoration can be scattered around the playing ground, or players can get during the game in the process of solving various technical puzzles.  As an example of such puzzles can be cited: <br><ul><li>  Proper connection of different units with correct cables. </li><li>  Diagnose Bad Blocks </li><li>  Assembly of several incomplete sets of parts of one complete </li><li>  Run restored systems </li><li>  Hacking object information systems </li></ul><br>  On the one hand, such tasks require specialized knowledge from the players, or at least a willingness to delve into such puzzles, but on the other hand, they take the gameplay to a whole new level.  Players actually solve problems adequate to the game space, they can personally observe the results of their actions, work with quite realistic nodes, and not abstract models.  All this increases the level of wroling and reduces the number of actions that are inappropriate to the game space, decouples the gameplay from the need for permanent control by the masters and their direct intervention in it.

      Igrotechnical process modeling can also greatly enhance the adequacy and realism of the playing space, make the game more intense and vibrant.  The interface of some abstract SCADA-system, data analysis program or hacker program solves several problems at once.  It allows you to naturally enter the necessary models in the gameplay.  It allows you to flexibly control the game process using parameters such as the success / failure of the operation, the time spent on the operation, the output of status data or warnings of failures.  The possibility of remote control of such a program solves the question of the direct presence of the master in the game space.  A beautifully drawn process of the program also significantly increases the atmosphericity of the game. <br><br>  As examples of modeling programs in the game process, you can cite programs simulating the development of viruses in the environment and analyzing statistics with the <a href="http://noon22.livejournal.com/">PRN Midday, XXII century.</a>  <a href="http://noon22.livejournal.com/">Secrets of Pandora "</a> , held in 2009.  On the game, as part of the game process, a bioblockade from viruses was synthesized, the genetic code of which was obtained by operations on the genetic codes of viruses and animals of the planet Pandora.  The interface of both programs is presented below: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/1c7/2bb/299/1c72bb299498f2595380a25c51ea342f.jpg"><br>  <i>The interface of the program of step-by-step simulation of the bioblock operation</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/511/9a9/8da/5119a98da0d47bab18d55e8eb098fece.jpg"><br>  <i>The interface of the program for analyzing the statistics of the experiment on the effectiveness of bioblock</i> <br><br>  The game program can also emulate the operation of any units that provide power or livelihoods of players, with the probability of removing these units from failure (overheating or silencing the reactor, disrupting the air regeneration cycle) with incorrect or sabotage players' actions.  As an example of the interface of such a program, one can cite the interface of the nuclear reactor control program of the <a href="http://marstefo.ru/">Mars-Tefo Mars</a> station of the research <a href="http://marstefo.ru/">center</a> , located in the Kosmos pavilion of the All-Russian Exhibition Center. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d47/c6c/3dc/d47c6c3dc2798ac60e6a3181792bc6d7.jpg"><br>  <i>The interface of the nuclear reactor control program.</i>  <i>Interactorium "Mars-Tefo"</i> <br><br>  At <a href="http://code.rpg.ru/">http://code.rpg.ru/</a> there is a page with links to source codes of programs written for various role projects. <br><br>  Adequate game play igrotehnichnaya communication can also greatly push the gameplay.  Input data and information thrown during the game can be in the form of document files, pieces of working notes from surveillance cameras or web-cameras.  Information that has been prepared in advance or recorded at the test site in the game space looks much more adequate than personal downloads, contributes to vrolingu and gives ample opportunities for the formation of quest lines. <br><br>  Raised jabber chat on consoles of teams located in different locations, broadcasting paging messages from the station's artificial intelligence to personal wearable player modules, as well as game sharing services greatly facilitate the injection of game information, eliminate the need for personal downloading by a master of players on the range, increase connectivity locations provide the ability to maintain hidden communication channels between insiders in teams and their management, as well as many other opportunities to control, maintain and improve quality  Grove of the process does not require direct personal communication between masters and igrotehami players. <br><br>  Transmitted messages do not have to be in the form of text or files.  A siren that triggers in dangerous situations, voice warnings from the intellectual systems of an object or the characteristic sounds of accidents (hissing of outgoing air, noises of mechanisms working with malfunction, etc.) not only bring the player to a much higher level of perception of the situation, but also allow feedback to him about the results of his actions without getting out of gaming reality. <br><br>  A separate item are man-made objects and artifacts.  Like magical artifacts, they can be anything.  Their range and gaming functionality largely depend only on the imagination of the masters and the gaming budget.  A characteristic element of the works and games around the Stalker world are dosimetric instruments, games in the Fallout universe, the Pip Boy 3000 multifunctional wrist computer, games on the subject of international terrorism, a bomb.  Devices can have both real prototypes and be completely invented.  A positron reactor, a Casimir generator, a hyperspatial transmitter, and other devices may look like some kind of high-tech artifacts, or they can be represented as their control panels or consoles. <br><br>  Here are some examples of devices actually manufactured on an RI: <br><br>  The ‚ÄúDark Tower‚Äù, MG of Rivendale series of games produced a set of radio beacons and dosimeter receivers, which, when registering the radiation of beacons, began to crackle like Geiger counters.  When dialing the maximum allowable dose, the dosimeter began to squeak constantly.  Deactivation was done by the master. <br><br>  AT ‚ÄúKin-Dza-Dza‚Äù, MG ‚ÄúRivendale‚Äù produced a set of visitors and ‚Äúpendants‚Äù of players.  Since a budget solution was required, the visitors were a standard DB-9 computer connector, which had batteries and two LEDs in its case.  The mate connector, located in the player in the form of a pendant, contained jumpers, thanks to which, when the visitor was connected to the pendant, the corresponding race led turned on: orange for chatlanin, or green for patsak. <br><br>  AT ‚ÄúOh, Paris!‚Äù, TG ‚ÄúOstranna‚Äù manufactured a non-automatic telephone station for 20 lines, operating according to the principle ‚ÄúYoung lady, connect‚Äù, as well as a set of entourage phones to it.  A photo of the station is shown below. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/1e4/7f1/535/1e47f15351f51e5ae2387d9e4ae99500.jpg"><br>  <i>Automatic telephone exchange.</i>  <i>TG "Ostranna"</i> <br><br>  AT ‚ÄúAliens Underground‚Äù, TG ‚ÄúOstranna‚Äù made a set of Alien detectors.  A transmitter with a motion sensor - an accelerometer was placed on each Alien.  The moving Alien began to emit a signal.  By deploying the detector, it was possible to detect the source of the signal. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ebb/0da/c2e/ebb0dac2e87bdc9f14b0549effa3bc30.jpg"><br>  <i>Detector "Aliens" with PRI "Aliens Underground", TG "Ostranna"</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b43/600/752/b43600752fbc76d91000ae4041e91afe.jpg"><br>  <i>Alien detector interface.</i>  <i>TG "Ostranna"</i> <br><br>  On the series of games TG "Ostranna" made laser locks with the possibility of hacking.  A closed lock projects a bright laser line onto the walls at the installation site.  The intersection of the guarded opening includes a siren.  With the help of a hacker-tula connected to a laptop with a special program, it is possible to break the lock and access its service functions. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/103/86a/b4c/10386ab4cc5c7b041dd9101fed88eba3.jpg"><br>  <i>Laser lock in the closed state.</i>  <i>TG "Ostranna"</i> <br><br>  Artyom Sergeev (Xotar) has developed and continues to modernize the role-playing version of the laser tag (xotaropus).  Ksotaropushka keeps records of available ammunition and types of charges.  The defeat of a cannon gun is made by a code sequence transmitted by a narrow beam in the infrared range, which must be reached by sensors mounted on the player‚Äôs head. <br><br>  For the Stalker series of games Igor Fedorenko from Chuguev (Ukraine) has developed and continues to upgrade the hardware and software complex of radio beacons, anomalies, a set of sensors for interactive interaction of anomalies with the environment, ‚Äúpills‚Äù and a personal portable PDA ‚ÄúLuch‚Äù that performs recording effects from various types of anomalies, as well as an indication of the player‚Äôs health, <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/3e4/76b/adb/3e476badb145eab3a7f189e0e9e4e275.jpg"><br>  <i>PDA "Ray" with established "pills", Igor Fedorenko.</i>  <i>Chuguev, Ukraine</i> <br><br>  Many interesting devices with detailed guides for their manufacture can be found on <a href="http://www.instructables.com/tag/type-id/category-technology/">instructables.com</a> .  For example, the nuclear electromagnetic bomb <a href="http://www.instructables.com/id/A-35-Doomsday-Device/">A-35 Doomsday Device</a> , or the <a href="http://www.instructables.com/id/Track-and-explode-wolf-collar/">tracking collar</a> . <br><br>  In some cases, it is not necessary to develop any man-made artifacts separately, since commercially available conventional devices are already adequate to the game space and can perform the actions necessary for the game process.  For example, in the Silent Hill series of games held by the UK Rangers MG in the catacombs of the Aksai military history museum, the most common receivers and fm transmitters were used.  The background ambient music, game code phrases were transmitted through the transmitters.  Through such kits, it is also possible to wake up anomalous zones, detect artifacts or monsters while strengthening the transmitter on things or playing games. <br><br>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/209616/">Role-playing technology.</a>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/209616/">Part 3.
