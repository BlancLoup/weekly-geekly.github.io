  <section class="page js-page"><h1>US senior officials consider WikiLeaks a # 1 threat to national security</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/836cec80/d3bdac63/bada6dc5/5a2f6fd3.jpg"><br><br>  It seems that after the publication of classified US documents on military operations in Afghanistan and Iraq on the WikiLeaks website, American authorities consider this resource extremely dangerous.  Some statements by US officials from the highest echelon of power make it clear that for them WikiLeaks may seem more dangerous than the very Al Qaeda or the Chinese Communists.  In any case, quite public personas of the United States offer the government to organize a cyber-attack on the notorious site.  And these are not empty words.  It all started with the fact that the Washington Post and the Washington Times criticized WikiLeaks on their pages for the actions of the team of this resource.  In particular, the publications believe that WikiLeaks should be attacked by the US authorities (as long as this is a figurative expression, this means legal ways to shut down the resource).  But under the cut - more interesting statements. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>  For example, Christian Viton, State Counselor under President George W. Bush, wrote a note in which he called on the US military to "make an electronic attack on WikiLeaks and on all the telecommunications companies that provide services to this service."  Sounds good, right?  In principle, it is not so difficult to carry out our plans - you don‚Äôt even need to attack.  The fact is that now WikiLeaks is hosted on a cloud from Amazon.com, in a data center near San Jose, California.  That is, the US just needs to come up with something, some reason, to simply turn off the servers serving WikiLeaks.  But the ‚Äúthreat to national security‚Äù is a very serious accusation.

      Resource CNET tried to contact representatives of the US Department of Defense and comment on the publications that appeared.  A representative of this Ministry refused to give any comment, saying only that ‚Äúan investigation is underway that aims to find out the source of the leakage of classified information on WikiLeaks‚Äù. <br><br>  Interestingly, in July of this year, when the resource posted secret documentation about the US campaign in Afghanistan, some public figures were in favor of "President Obama making the decision and closing the site."  Then WikiLeaks hosted in the data center of Iceland, and Obama was advised to "press this country to close the site." <br><br>  James Lewis, one of the leaders of the Center for Strategic and International Studies organization, said that a cyber attack against WikiLeaks would be a useless, much better goal was Essendge (!). <br><br>  Marc Thiessen, who wrote speeches for the same Bush, suggested that the US government not only use legislation, but also intelligence and military forces in order to "stop this criminal syndicate and bring Essendja to justice."  As we see, WikiLeaks is already a ‚Äúcrime syndicate‚Äù. <br><br>  In order to protect themselves, WikiLeaks prepared for work mirrors WikiLeaks.fr, WikiLeaks.se, WikiLeaks.de, WikiLeaks.nl, WikiLeaks.is. <br><br>  In August, a spokesman for Geoff Morrell announced that "there is the possibility of offensive actions against WikiLeaks."  It is not difficult to guess who will attack - the very special US unit, which was recently formed to protect against cyber attacks of terrorists.  Apparently, WikiLeaks is now the number one terrorist for the United States. <br><br>  In general, everything develops according to the principle ‚Äúyou don't have democracy yet?  Then we go to you!".  Let's see how it all ends. <br><br>  Via <a href="http://news.cnet.com/8301-13578_3-20020835-38.html">CNET</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/288806/">https://habr.com/ru/post/288806/</a></p>
