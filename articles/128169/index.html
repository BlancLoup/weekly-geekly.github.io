  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Simile TimeLine - a library for displaying events on a timeline</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Time goes on.  Years fly by, just have time to count how many have passed them since I went to school, went to college, got married, and the children were born.  But besides his life there are still many things that change, develop, appear and disappear over time. <br><br>  So an interesting tool for a visual presentation of events and periods on the timeline is Simile TimeLine. <br><br>  Next, I will tell you what encouraged me to use this tool, and in what way I find its use extremely convenient.  In my description will be a little about Asterisk, call centers and, in fact, the javascript-library <a href="http://www.simile-widgets.org/timeline/">Simile TimeLine</a> . <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Recently, an interesting project on the organization of a call-center on Asterisk.  One of the requirements of the project was to receive calls only by registered operators in the system.  Let me explain what it means. 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>
        <script>
          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      The customer has more than a dozen employees of operators who receive calls.  This is a round-the-clock service for receiving calls.  Operators work in shifts.  When the operator replaces the change, he registers in the system by entering his PIN code at the operator‚Äôs workplace.  Now this operator will receive calls from customers of the customer. <br><br>  Asterisk transfers incoming calls from clients that arrive at the multichannel number only to registered operators, so if an operator needs to leave as needed, it is removed from registration in the system by entering a code. <br><br>  Thus, for each operator, we have two events: setting and deregistration in the system, which limit a certain period of time for the operator to receive calls. <br><br>  Since a multichannel number receives a lot of calls, we have statistics on received and unanswered calls.  With received calls, everything is clear - accepted, recorded and good! <br><br>  But with the unaccepted there can be two situations: a) the client did not listen to the voice greeting and hung up (it‚Äôs also clear with such - perhaps it wasn‚Äôt much that he wanted to call) or b) the client‚Äôs call was put in a queue when everything registered in the system the operators were busy, and the client did not wait for an answer and hung up. <br><br>  For a more detailed analysis of the work of operators, their workload can be used Simile TimeLine, for example, to visualize the periods of registration of operators in the system, because it is better to see once in the aggregate than to view the logs of registrations.  An example of such a representation in the figure (numbers are operator numbers). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/f088c3b7/3badc41e/23732262/4999f9d4.png"><br><br>  You can give more examples of how to analyze the work of the operators, but since this topic is dedicated to TimeLine, I‚Äôll end up with Asterisk and the call center, and then cite references for use in other projects: <br><br><ul><li>  Worldwide Conferences on Semiconductors: <a href="http://www.semi-directory.com/events.asp">http://www.semi-directory.com/events.asp</a> </li><li>  The development of the Google Android platform: <a href="http://www.androidacademy.com/4-android-timeline">http://www.androidacademy.com/4-android-timeline</a> (check out how many events on this subject have become in the last year). </li></ul><br><br>  Simile TimeLine - <a href="http://www.simile-widgets.org/timeline/">http://www.simile-widgets.org/timeline/</a> - project page (for example, the events of US political life, the central event is a shot at John F. Kennedy). <br><br>  Detailed guide " <a href="http://www.simile-widgets.org/wiki/Getting_Started_with_Timeline">How to start using Simile TimeLine</a> ". <br><br>  The component supports loading data in XML, JSON.  For each event in the data file, you can specify a description, link, icon. <br><br><ul><li>  Since I was looking for the library I needed, I also found TimeGlider (the <a href="https://github.com/timeglider/jquery_widget">code is here</a> ) - another library for representing the timeline as a jQuery plugin.  Maybe someone will like in the development.  I will note only a cool feature - the time scale - you can look down on the year, or you can zoom in and see each day.  <a href="http://timeglider.com/jquery/%3Fp%3Dintro">An example is here</a> . </li></ul><br><br>  In general, everyone can create their own TimeLine and fill it with events:). </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/128169/">https://habr.com/ru/post/128169/</a></p>
