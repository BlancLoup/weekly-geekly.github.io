They allowed to describe, understand and implement SOLID in real work with a software project. </p><br><p>  It has become interesting to analyze the applicability of these concepts for generally accepted programming paradigms, for example, for OOP.  Well, if the result of this work will be useful to you. </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/291/b01/aa4/291b01aa4949513c726bbf5cb33fad80.jpg" alt="image"></p><a name="habracut"></a><br><p>  Today there are many approaches for the design and subsequent implementation of software projects.  The most popular in work with large software projects are: <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A1%25D1%2582%25D1%2580%25D1%2583%25D0%25BA%25D1%2582%25D1%2583%25D1%2580%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B5_%25D0%25BF%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B3%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BC%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B8%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B5">structured programming</a> , <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A4%25D1%2583%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BA%25D1%2586%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BB%25D1%258C%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B5_%25D0%25BF%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B3%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BC%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B8%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B5">functional programming</a> , <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259E%25D0%25B1%25D1%258A%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BA%25D1%2582%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BE-%25D0%25BE%25D1%2580%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD%25D1%2582%25D0%25B8%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B5_%25D0%25BF%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B3%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BC%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B8%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B5">object-oriented programming</a> . </p><br><p>  For me, it became interesting to analyze the causes of these design approaches.  And in the process of analysis, the unexpected discovery was the fact that they all implicitly are based on the following premise: </p><br><pre><code class="plaintext hljs">          ,      .</code> </pre> <br><h2 id="razvitie-programmnogo-proekta">  Development of a software project </h2><br><p>  What is a project without development?  Such projects are occasionally found and are mainly characterized by fast piece-rate payment without the occurrence of subsequent obligations on the part of the programmer, for example: </p><br><ul><li>  a small project that can be written from one approach; </li><li>  a project without a structurally complex code, burdened with a large number of relationships; </li><li>  software without the need for maintenance and user support. </li></ul><br><p>  In such situations, the programmer‚Äôs efforts to maintain, for example, an object-oriented approach, are wasted.  It often happens that I find myself in such a meaningless lesson during the development of a one-time console utility, when I suddenly realize that writing the 4th grade text in this project delayed me for 15 minutes and did not bring the result closer.  The saddest thing is that all classes that were hardly written in such projects are forgotten and not reused, that is, they do not facilitate our work further. </p><br><p>  In all other situations, the programmer, minimizing his work, must develop a structurally complex project, that is: </p><br><ul><li>  To correct errors by analyzing the code and finding the places where these errors are formed. </li><li>  Introduce new functionality, while maintaining the performance of all previously available capabilities.  At the same time use the existing code (written and tested) in the implementation of these new tasks. </li><li>  Provide support in using the software product. </li><li>  Perform a description and coordination of the functionality of all versions of the project. </li><li>  Keep working all the data formats used by the project (even outdated). </li><li>  And to perform many other tasks appearing in confrontation with competitors, caused by changing frameworks or the completion of support for outdated OS ... </li></ul><br><p>  If we look for analogies to the development of a software project, then we can recall the evolution of a biological species. </p><br><pre> <code class="plaintext hljs">     "".     -       .       -  .</code> </pre> <br><p>  The work of the programmer is not easy, but the programmer has a "helper".  This helper is hidden somewhere deep in the structure of our world, in which there are two features: </p><br><ul><li>  the ability to write one useful algorithm and use it for a variety of similar tasks, </li><li>  the presence of a large set of tasks similar in their solution. </li></ul><br><p>  For the sake of brevity, this algorithm useful in many areas will be referred to as the <em>universal</em> algorithm.  Its implementation for a specific application can be called specialization, since the process of specifying an algorithm for use in a narrow application area is similar to the evolutionary specialization of cells in a living organism. </p><br><p>  Obviously, to create an algorithm, it is required to single out features that ensure the applicability of the algorithm.  These attributes must be sought in the input data and in the description of the initial situation (context).  To create a <em>universal</em> algorithm, it is necessary in each subject area, which has its own sets of data and situation characteristics, to select the signs of applicability, identical for all areas.  All other signs that do not provide applicability are ignored by the <em>universal</em> algorithm.  Formalizing the <em>universal</em> algorithm, we came to the need to use <em>abstraction</em> - one of the most important principles of OOP.  At the same time, OOP is characterized by an emphasis only on data abstraction. </p><br><p>  Here I will try to write examples of the use of <em>abstraction</em> from different areas. </p><br><table><thead><tr><th>  Abstraction </th><th>  Algorithms </th><th>  Application area </th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>  Integers </td><td>  Algorithms of quantitative calculations </td><td>  Tasks of accounting of economic values </td></tr><tr><td>  Mass characteristic of the material body </td><td>  Algorithms-operations comparison of the amount of substance </td><td>  The task of comparing the value of the goods, not amenable to the account </td></tr><tr><td>  Interface with operations for the collection of elements: a complete traversal, comparison and exchange of positions </td><td>  Collection sorting algorithms </td><td>  Programming </td></tr><tr><td>  Interface identical operations for the "leaf node" and "branch node" in the tree </td><td>  Algorithms based on the Linker design pattern </td><td>  Development of a complex software project </td></tr><tr><td>  Key concept "Worker" </td><td>  The wording in the section "Employment contract" </td><td>  Labor Code </td></tr></tbody></table><br><h2 id="stroitelnyy-blok-programmnogo-proekta">  Building block of the program project </h2><br><p>  Using different methods of abstraction, the programmer performs the implementation of the algorithm in the form of a piece of code, which is a separate and complete element of his work.  This element, depending on the programming language used, can be a function, an object, and a sequence of instructions.  For the sake of convenience, we will call this code fragment the word " <strong>component</strong> ". </p><br><p>  <strong>Component</strong> - code segment (procedure, class, deployment component, etc.): </p><br><ul><li>  which implements some complete algorithm that works in certain initial situations and with certain input data, </li><li>  which is possible to use several times in one project (even better many times in different projects), </li><li>  all instructions of which are located close and viewed without the need for additional search operations in the development environment, </li><li>  changes in which the programmer performs relatively independently with respect to the rest of the code. </li></ul><br><h2 id="zakonomernosti-v-razvitii-programmnogo-proekta">  Patterns in the development of a software project </h2><br><p>  Using the term <strong>component</strong> , it is possible to formulate a set of simple laws that exist in the development of a software project.  I will present these patterns in the form of the following statements, divided into 3 categories. </p><br><ol><li>  Statements describing the properties of a <strong>component</strong> . <br>  1.1.  A correctly written <strong>component is</strong> necessarily used and more often several times. <br>  1.2.  In each place where the <strong>component is</strong> used, it is expected to invariably behave, leading to repeatable results. <br>  1.3.  When using the <strong>component</strong> in several places, the result must satisfy each place of use. <br>  1.4.  Behavior inherent in the <strong>component</strong> , forms restrictions for the use of this <strong>component</strong> . <br>  1.5.  In each place of use of a <strong>component</strong> all its limitations can be involved. <br>  1.6.  Any change to a <strong>component</strong> changes its limitations and requires verification of all places where it is used, which causes the programmer to spend time. <br>  1.7.  <strong>It is</strong> advisable to record the <strong>component</strong> as a code in one copy, that is, it is necessary to eliminate duplication of the same code.  This will reduce the number of edits when making changes to the <strong>component</strong> . </li><li>  Statements describing patterns in the implementation of a programmer's new task. <br>  2.1 The option of implementing a new task is advisable to choose minimizing the time spent by the programmer. <br>  2.2.  To implement the new task, the programmer can add new <strong>components</strong> or change the behavior of old <strong>components</strong> . <br>  2.3.  Adding a <strong>component</strong> basically requires checking only at the location of a new use, and it generates a minimal amount of time spent by the programmer. <br>  2.4.  The change in the <strong>component's</strong> behavior due to the new task, according to statement [1.6], requires checking at the place of the new use and in all places of the old use, which creates additional time costs for the programmer compared to the situation in the statement [2.3].  In the case of a published <strong>component,</strong> this requires the work of all programmers using the modified <strong>component</strong> . </li><li>  Statements describing patterns in the interaction of <em>universal</em> algorithms and their specializations: <br>  3.1.  It is possible to write a <em>base</em> <strong>component</strong> (the name is entered by analogy with the base class and further for brevity we will use the word " <em>base</em> ").  <em>The base</em> performs only the most important features of a <em>universal</em> algorithm. <br>  3.2.  It is possible to write a <strong>component</strong> -specialization (for brevity, we will use the word " <em>specialization</em> ").  <em>Specialization</em> complements the <em>universal</em> <em>base</em> algorithm, making it applicable to a specific area of ‚Äã‚Äãuse. <br>  3.3.  <em>The base</em> , as follows from the statements of [3.1], [3.2], has less complexity and less restrictions in application than <em>specialization</em> . <br>  3.4.  According to the statement [1.7], it is advisable to develop the <em>specialization</em> without duplicating the code of the <em>universal</em> algorithm from the <em>database</em> . <br>  3.5.  <em>Base</em> use places do not require verification after making changes to a correctly formed <em>specialization</em> . </li></ol><br><h2 id="ponyatiya-obektno-orientirovannogo-programmirovaniya">  Concepts of object-oriented programming </h2><br><p>  I will try, using the above statements, to perform an analysis of the basic concepts of object-oriented programming.  This analysis bypasses the concept of <em>abstraction</em> , since it has already been described earlier in the formalization of the method for constructing a <em>universal</em> algorithm. </p><br><h3 id="klass-obekt">  Class, Object </h3><br><p>  These concepts of OOP reinforce the expediency of using a special type of <strong>component</strong> , described by a combination of some internal data and methods for working with this data.  All the statements of the group [1] and [2] are translated into OOP, for which the term <strong>component</strong> is replaced by the concept <em>class</em> . </p><br><p>  At the same time, at first glance, <em>class</em> and <em>object</em> relations <em>are</em> exhausted by a group of statements [3], in which the <em>base</em> is replaced by the concept <em>class</em> , and the <em>implementation</em> is replaced by the concept <em>object</em> .  Moreover, the <em>implementation</em> turns out to be dynamic, that is, changeable during the execution of the program. </p><br><h3 id="inkapsulyaciya">  Encapsulation </h3><br><p>  The concept of " <em>encapsulation</em> " can be considered from two "sides". </p><br><p>  The first side of the concept of " <em>encapsulation</em> " is the separation of the <strong>component</strong> from other parts of the code.  This property allows the programmer to perform changes in the <strong>component</strong> to perform operations in areas of code that are close to each other.  That is, to minimize the time spent by the programmer, excluding from work the search and analysis of the separate interacting elements of the program.  This side is determined by the properties of the <strong>component</strong> , following from its definition. </p><br><p>  The second side of the concept of " <em>encapsulation</em> " - is hiding the internal implementation of the <strong>component</strong> .  This concealment is possible using the concepts of <em>base</em> and <em>implementation</em> described in the statement group [3].  To do this, the public <em>class</em> methods <em>are</em> identified with the <em>base</em> , and the private and protected class methods with the <em>implementation</em> .  In the places of use, the constraints formed by the <em>base are used</em> , and therefore it is possible to make changes in the <em>implementation</em> that do not concern the <em>basic</em> constraints.  And these <em>implementation</em> changes do not need to be checked at the places of use of the <em>database</em> [3.5], which minimizes the effort of the programmer. </p><br><p>  It is noteworthy that the concept of " <em>encapsulation</em> " has an analogy in biology.  This process is its first party similar to the biological functions of the " <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259A%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B5%25D1%2582%25D0%25BE%25D1%2587%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B0%25D1%258F_%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B1%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B0">Cell membrane</a> ". </p><br><h3 id="nasledovanie">  Inheritance </h3><br><p>  The concept of " <em>inheritance</em> " continues to reinforce the importance of using the <em>base</em> + <em>implementation</em> .  To do this, in the group of statements [3], it is necessary to identify the methods of the parent class with the <em>base</em> , and the methods of the heir class to identify with the <em>implementation</em> . </p><br><p>  In its implementation, the concept of " <em>inheritance</em> " allows you to use the statement [2.3], that is, to use the addition of the code instead of changing and duplicating it.  At the same time, it is necessary to eliminate duplication of the <em>basic</em> algorithm.  However, the approach that uses <em>inheritance</em> to specialize the <em>universal</em> algorithm has a significant disadvantage.  This drawback is the presence of two strongly connected <strong>components</strong> that are difficult to change independently.  These dependencies-dependencies are generated by the parent-heir relationship. </p><br><p>  There are many alternative ways to use the <em>base</em> + <em>implementation</em> bundle.  I will give further examples of such methods. </p><br><table><thead><tr><th>  <em>Base</em> </th><th>  <em>Implementation</em> </th><th>  Application area </th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>  Public class methods </td><td>  Private class methods </td><td>  <em>Encapsulation</em> </td></tr><tr><td>  Protected methods of the parent class </td><td>  Subclass Methods </td><td>  <em>Inheritance</em> </td></tr><tr><td>  Dynamic library interface </td><td>  Dynamic library functionality </td><td>  <strong>Component</strong> = dynamic library </td></tr><tr><td>  Template (generic) methods and classes (template, generic) </td><td>  Instantiating a template with specified arguments </td><td>  Generalized programming </td></tr><tr><td>  Generic delegate methods </td><td>  Specialization of methods specifying specific processing procedures </td><td>  Procedures for sorting or forming a tree, with an indication of the method of assessing the order of elements </td></tr><tr><td>  Classes involving interaction with the "Visitor" template </td><td>  Formation of the "Visitor" with the required functionality </td><td>  Visitor Design Pattern </td></tr><tr><td>  NPP control panel </td><td>  The combination of automation and equipment of nuclear power plants </td><td>  Hiding the complexity of the system from the NPP operator </td></tr></tbody></table><br><p>  In parallel, I notice that for the concept of " <em>inheritance</em> " from the PLO, it is also possible to find an analogy in the processes of biological evolution.  In biology, the term " <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259D%25D0%25B0%25D1%2581%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B4%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BE%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D1%258C"><em>heredity</em></a> " is used for this. </p><br><h3 id="polimorfizm">  Polymorphism </h3><br><p>  In my opinion, the concept of " <em>polymorphism</em> " is the second side when looking at the procedure for creating a <em>universal</em> algorithm.  The first side ( <em>abstraction</em> ) is a look from the point of view of how to create a <em>universal</em> algorithm.  At the same time, when looking at the <em>universal</em> algorithm from the user's point of view, we get the notion of <em>polymorphism</em> .  That is, <em>polymorphism</em> is the useful ability of a function ( <strong>component</strong> ) to process data of different types.  Adding this concept to OOP reinforces the usefulness of using a <em>universal</em> algorithm in the design of a software project. </p><br><p>  Implementations of polymorphism in different programming languages ‚Äã‚Äãare very different.  In a Wikipedia article for <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259F%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BC%25D0%25BE%25D1%2580%25D1%2584%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B7%25D0%25BC_(%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BD%25D1%2584%25D0%25BE%25D1%2580%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B0%25D1%2582%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B0)">polymorphism</a> , depending on its implementation, there are 4 subtypes: parametric, inclusions (or subtypes), overload, type conversion.  These implementations have significant differences, but they are all united by one goal - this is writing a <em>universal</em> algorithm that will not need to be duplicated for its particular <em>specialization</em> . </p><br><p>  And this time, almost without surprise, I found an analogy for the concept of " <em>polymorphism</em> " in biology.  The name of this biological term fully coincides with the concept of the PLO.  ‚Äú <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259F%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BC%25D0%25BE%25D1%2580%25D1%2584%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B7%25D0%25BC_(%25D0%25B1%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BB%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B3%25D0%25B8%25D1%258F)"><em>Polymorphism</em></a> ‚Äù is the ability of a single organism to exist in states with different internal structures or in different external forms. </p><br><h2 id="zaklyuchenie">  Conclusion </h2><br><p>  Thus, almost all the basic concepts of OOP can be represented as a set of simple statements, formed on the basis of the laws governing the development of a software project.  At the same time for OOP, the term <strong>component is</strong> identified with the concept of <em>class</em> .  If we select another value for the term <strong>component</strong> , for example, a <em>function</em> , then it is possible to formulate the basic concepts of <em>functional</em> <em>programming</em> . </p><br><p>  In the process of writing the article, biological analogies were found for the concepts used in programming.  These analogies appear due to the similarity of ways of developing a software product and some processes of biological evolution. </p><br><p>  IMHO, it is advisable to consider these two scientific areas together.  In this case, it may be possible to carry out the transfer of laws from one industry to another, and thereby ensure the development of both information technologies and formal descriptions of biological processes. </p><br><p>  Thank you for attention. </p><br><h2 id="otzyvy">  Reviews </h2><br><p>  I would be very grateful for the feedback, suggestions and suggestions, as they help me to adjust the direction of development of work in this area. </p><br><h2 id="ssylki">  Links </h2><br><ul><li>  <a href="https://bitbucket.org/aibor/ai_borisov_cit/wiki/Home">General theory of algorithms wiki</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/446066/">The first article of the series</a> </li></ul><br><p>  Edited by Borisova M.V. </p></div>
