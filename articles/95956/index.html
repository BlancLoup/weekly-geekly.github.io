This one, I think, will not be the last, too much is unclear in this pseudo-regulatory document, too many loopholes for the regulator, and for the performer, too many frank misunderstanding of the basic principles of the industry. <br><br>  A <a href="http://belta.by/ru/conference/i_116.html">conference</a> took place yesterday on the website of BELTA, where people responsible for the future of Bynet again tried to clarify a few points of the decree, interpreting some of the provisions so that more questions remained than were answered.  Probably, everything could have been less sad, but the general tone makes it once again seriously think, is it time to change something globally?

      To begin with, the saddest answer for me.  I do not want to comment on it, but this is the whole Belarusian official, the quintessence beyond good and evil. <br><br>  Artemy Nikolaevich, Minsk: <br>  <i>Good day.</i>  <i>Please answer the following question: what to do with Internet resources hosted on the Google App Engine platform, because it‚Äôs impossible to transfer them to Belarusian hosting physically?</i> <br><br>  Alexander Gorbach: <i>It is clear that world giants use a large number of capacities, some of which are idle, and this additional service, which is provided, including free of charge.</i>  <i>I can say that these companies also earn money on such ‚Äúfree‚Äù services.</i>  <i>Is it profitable to our domestic organizations?</i>  <i>From my point of view, if you start an IT project, then it‚Äôs good if you can store your developments on your sites, where you can protect your information, and not spread it somewhere in the public domain and be ‚Äúnourished ¬ªFor worldwide projects.</i> <i><br></i> <br>  Like this‚Ä¶ <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  The honorable second place will be taken by Pavel Petrulevich‚Äôs answer to the question about the company's website, which is located on its own server, physically located in the office of this company.  Deputy  The Head of the Telecommunications Department of the Ministry of Communications and Informatization advises, if possible, to substitute his provider, since it is he, the provider, who is obliged to register your resource.  As a provider, it is not very clear to know about this, but if someone is interested, you can set up a couple of experiments at Beltelecom. <br><br>  Bronze medal - again, Alexander Gorbach, again an interesting offer, which does not calm my fantasy.  On the issue of wi-fi, the head of the OAC department at the President says: <br><br>  <i>Today, if Wi-Fi access cards are already implemented and not yet activated and not spent, then the providers should decide what to do with them.</i>  <i>Naturally, on some gratuitous basis, these cards must go through the procedure of the same registration, which is determined by decree.</i>  <i>Subscriber identification should be.</i> <br><br>  Where to occupy this multikilometer queue is not indicated, so you have to wait for the next such conference.  But something tells me that the same MTS will roll the sale of Beltelecom‚Äôs cards with payment by SMS.  There is, of course, the option to send information by phone number, but I do not think that the game is worth the candle. <br><br>  Further answers are lengthy, most are devoid of any practical use and are very vague, sometimes simply contradictory.  So the aforementioned A. Gorbach responds to my countryman, Denis Petrovich, about the extension of the registration period like this: <br><br>  <i>This issue will be resolved taking into account the technical capabilities of Internet service providers and RUE "BelGIE".</i> <i><br></i> <br>  But Sergey Rudnev, the head of the information technology sector of the infrastructure management and development of informatization of the informatization department of the Ministry of Communications, categorical <br><br>  <i>The registration period is determined by presidential decree and will not be transferred.</i> <i><br></i> <br>  Anyway, ‚Äúauxiliary equipment‚Äù located outside Belarus can still be used.  What kind of equipment and how it can be used, of course, is not clear.  Here, as you understand, there is a large field for activity. <br><br>  I would note, however, that the ideas of registering mailboxes and moving Google, HP, Coca-cola, etc. that were remarkable in their madness did not find support in Belarus and were modestly canceled.  Non-residents do not need to transfer the resource to Belarus and do not need to register the boxes either. <br><br>  Everywhere it is emphasized many times that ‚Äú... the main thing is for Belarusian consumers to use the facilities of the equipment placed here ...‚Äù Certainly happy, such care is about their citizens and the norms of their high morals.  It seems to me how many happy parents will write statements about disabling the ability to view porn sites of their children.  I will leave any insinuations about the real goals and objectives of this decree, let me just say that it‚Äôs not so much a leaky and insane decree that scares you how many people who will execute it. <br><br>  The author of the topic is @Saldacenkaw, but for obvious reasons, he cannot publish it. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/95956/">https://habr.com/ru/post/95956/</a></p>
