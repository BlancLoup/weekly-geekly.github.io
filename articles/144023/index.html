Next in line are smartphones, tablets on Android and Connected TV.  You can buy and start watching a movie on your iPad on the road, and continue at home on the big screen. <br><br>  In essence, this is a ‚Äúcloud‚Äù on the basis of a geographically distributed platform for the distribution of digital content, which ensures high-quality content delivery to all subscribers, even in remote regions of Russia. <br>  In addition to the central hub, where content is stored and maintained and where, including, it is converted to the user's screen, there are 7 more macro-regional nodes and 77 regional - in most of the regions of Russia.  These nodes perform the transport function, they deliver the content. <br><br>  More than 50 companies and 600 people participated in the development of the platform. <br><br>  The project has more than 100 content partners, which provides a variety of legal content.  Including  BBC, Discovery, Sony Pictures, Universal Studios, Central Partnership, 20th Century Fox, National Geographic, VGTRK, STV, NTV + etc. <br><br>  <i>Comment by Andrei Kholodny, Director of the Media Products Project Office of Rostelecom OJSC:</i> <br><br>  <b>Why we believe that people will pay for content</b> <br><br>  Until now, there has often been no high-quality legal and AVAILABLE alternative to pirated content, especially in the regions.  It was often impossible to watch a film legally in HD quality outside a million-plus city: even if you are willing to pay money, the film will slow down. <br>  We have placed our nodes in each regional center and created a convenient platform.  Paying for content is also convenient.  Both one-time purchases and subscriptions to a set of content are available.  We have given digital legal content for the price of pirated discs.  New movies and music cost 100..150 rubles.  On average, any content on the portal is less than 50 rubles. <br>  We gave the opportunity to buy only what you really want to watch, for example, we abandoned the practice of ‚Äúbasic packages‚Äù: you can only subscribe to the content (for example, sports TV channels) that you are interested in. <br><br>  We made the connection and rental of the TV box free. <br><br>  <b>Why we do it</b> <br><br>  The needs of users have become more complicated: people began to watch TV differently, more and more teenagers are leaving the television screen on the Internet, even when they watch TV content.  It is clear that today‚Äôs teenagers are our clients after 10 years, and if we don‚Äôt provide them with alternatives to traditional television viewing in a format that is convenient for them, then in 10 years we will not see them among our clients.  These changes in the consumption of content are not only characteristic of young people: studies show that, even while watching TV on the big screen, viewers simultaneously read something or write on the Internet.  This is a massive trend. <br><br>  As a result of the research, it became clear to us that this applies not only to Moscow, but also to the regions. <br>  We have seen that piracy, which is widespread throughout the country, is even more common in the regions than in large cities, but in the interviews people told us: ‚ÄúWe would be willing to pay - but we simply have no other alternative than to download it from torrents. <br><br>  Gradually, this knowledge accumulated and we realized that it was necessary to make a product that combines all digital content at once: not only video, but also music, books, software, games and make it available on different screens - on a computer, ipad, large TV -screen <br><br>  <b>We went from the needs of people, not from technology.</b> <br><br>  Technique must serve the business, and not vice versa. <br><br>  The first person we hired into the project was a market research agency: they studied how people view content, whether they are satisfied or not satisfied, willing to pay or not.  Then we attracted designers.  It was long before we started thinking about technology at all. <br>  Designers based on the research data formed user scenarios - it became clear from them that the logic of all interfaces should be common and unified.  After that, they rendered the entire interface - once for all platforms. <br>  And only after that the technical work began, when we began to select contractors, etc.  It was difficult to communicate and preserve the general idea and logic: we were often offered to simplify a number of functions, because they were difficult to implement: the interfaces were difficult, we required good animation, transitions.  But we insisted on not departing from the initial design and design ideas. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/2a4/d0e/b3e/2a4d0eb3e07baf2ffff334636f08cae0.png" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>How it works now</b> <br><br>  In the test version, the Internet portal <a href="http://zabava.ru/">Zabava.ru is</a> open from April 5, 2012, and more than 1.5 million users have already visited it. <br><br>  iPad app waiting appruva in the App Store.  Android and iPhone applications are in development, their launch is a matter of priorities: Android users are much less willing to pay for content than iOS device owners. <br><br>  Sales have started so far only in the macro-regions ‚ÄúCenter‚Äù and the Urals: there you can already leave a request and connect.  Yesterday, for example, included the first subscribers.  They are happy <br><br>  <b>First results</b> <br><br>  The first results on zabava.ru surprise us a little in a positive way. <br>  This project has two indicators: <br>  1. conversion from the number of those who came to the number of those who made the purchase. <br>  2. average purchase price <br>  The first indicator of <a href="http://zabava.ru/">Zabava.ru</a> is twice as high as in the market, and the average purchase price is 4 times higher. <br><br>  Video presentation at the Sviaz-Expocomm conference: <a href="http://youtu.be/v43wdsccaMI">youtu.be/v43wdsccaMI</a> <br>  View presentation: <a href="http://prezi.com/egf-lxepl4yp/zabavaru/">prezi.com/egf-lxepl4yp/zabavaru</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/144023/">https://habr.com/ru/post/144023/</a></p>
