      A week ago, Huawei held a press breakfast at the Pushkin Cafe, which introduced two new tablets on sale.  These are 7 and 10 inch models, each of which is interesting in its own way.  MediaPad 7 Lite is a budget modification that has become popular due to its very good performance and affordable MediaPad price.  Lite - because the core of the new model is not a dual-core, but a single-core Cortex A8 processor with a frequency of 1.2Ghz. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f48/b41/d91/f48b41d91c383beac499974ff2633d2c.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  But I was more interested in another model: MediaPad 10 FHD.  From the name it is clear that this is a 10-inch tablet with Full HD resolution display.  However, not all so simple.  Firstly, even in terms of display resolution, it is not a standard Full HD, but 1920x1200.  At the same time, it is an IPS-matrix with excellent viewing angles, tending to 180 degrees.  Secondly, the tablet works on its own, ‚ÄúHuaveevsky‚Äù 4-core processor, combined with a 16-core GPU.  This platform was introduced at the beginning of this year at the World Mobile Congress in Barcelona and made a lot of noise, because the tests proved to be more powerful than NVIDIA Tegra 3. Well, in the third, this is one of the few tablets equipped with 2 GB of RAM, although in the sample, turned out to be on my test, the benchmarks showed only 1 GB of RAM. <br><br>  I used the tablet for several days and despite the fact that I liked it from the very beginning, I couldn‚Äôt feel personal love for it, such as, for example, imbued with Nexus 7. It would seem that something else might be needed: a great display, the most powerful iron, at least in benchmarks and inferior in performance as Tegra 3, and Exynos 4412 Samsung'a, but enough for the device to work without brakes.  Three-dimensional games with detailed graphics work on the Cortex-A9 Quad 1.4GHz no slower than on Tegra 3, for example.  8 megapixel main camera acceptable photographs and shoots video in Full HD resolution, and 1.3 megapixel, front - in 720r.  A slot for a full-size SIM card and for micro-SD is available.  The battery capacity of 6600 mAh without problems is enough for a long working day, smoothly flowing into the night.  And with all this, the tablet weighs only 580 grams.  Yes, Apple is such a piece of hardware and was not filmed, the new iPad is smaller, and weighs almost 100 grams.  more! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a2c/d5b/1c7/a2cd5b1c7942f220224c3b19b499ccd6.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/uyCZUHJ9iVA%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700021,15700043,15700186,15700190,15700253,15700255,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhgUpAxwu0XNjvL4x0XXpn5lkXsAqw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e1b/87b/666/e1b87b666052735e02cc28ee589148df.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/9ec/fac/ed4/9ecfaced467ffde23d89ed7b978cd499.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/9ba/ba9/fb3/9baba9fb357a3d76c726444776b9f2ce.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/9af/86d/e1a/9af86de1af2e8ab78d994df5e2ff3993.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/7b6/ea7/923/7b6ea79232f722d0724f61607b78934f.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  From the point of view of ergonomics, you can only find fault with the protrusion of the eye of the main camera - I think that over time, the lens glass will scratch due to this protrusion, which, naturally, is not good.  Otherwise, everything is fine: the aluminum case, the thickness is only 8.8 mm, even the longitudinal white plastic lining on the back cover in the vicinity of the camera does not spoil the overall look.  And yet, something is not something, something is not that lacking, everything seems to be cool, but the wow effect does not work, although the technical characteristics are, frankly, top-notch. <br><br>  It would seem that everything can be blamed on Android ICS (the upgrade to Jelly Bean is promised only in the first quarter of next year), the customization of which is a cross between the TouchWiz Samsung and Flyme OS from Meizu, which lacks the panel of installed applications and shortcuts on desktops, as in iOS.  But on the other hand, ICS is, as they say, ICS in Africa, and therefore why find fault with him? <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/52f/73b/76d/52f73b76d56f2b1bb3f0638bb25c334a.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/19b/539/00b/19b53900b81a425c5eefa9ece37085c0.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c68/d98/869/c68d9886965c35192cd8bbc5e9c8fac3.png" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/4ae/534/c9f/4ae534c9f0ca7ba1bc329ee6aa5c251e.png" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/fa8/dd3/46c/fa8dd346c15cb57caea3287d0f1e6c63.png" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/418/c02/f23/418c02f23ee432c56dc5b701556c74bb.png" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/07b/e6a/118/07be6a1184186cee780fddbc4e823401.png" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d16/06f/896/d1606f89672a91bdc4631f47ccbafae8.png" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/bb3/fb0/4d5/bb3fb04d5cfc9a2e73ad5d62b0a6a2ac.png" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/33d/311/3ea/33d3113ea9480aa545a8381bfc25693c.png" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/77c/4d4/1ee/77c4d41eeca478f7f7dc33bc0149db29.png" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f7e/960/317/f7e960317d7f01d5d1a328b88092552d.png" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/0ee/e95/127/0eee95127553e3cf339ccc5c2801502c.png" alt="image"><br><br>  In general, I thought over several days and wrote down the following in my notebook: <br><br>  The problem, perhaps, is that neither Huawei nor ZTE have ever had experience in developing a user interface, which, by the way, is an equally important element of the device's ergonomics than thickness, or the back cover material.  As a result, as far as the user interface is concerned, these companies offer either the so-called ‚Äúbare android‚Äù or a combination of these or other finds from other manufacturers.  Here, by the way, it would not be superfluous to take into account that the very same Samsung TouchWiz is by no means an ideally convenient shell.  Yes, it can be more or less customized using various delivery programs (keyboards, for example), but still it is far from the ergonomics of iOS or MeeGo Harmattan. <br><br>  As a result, Huawei and ZTE devices do not get any worse than Samsung or HTC, and by individual technical characteristics are better at all, but since there is no unique offer in terms of user interface, there is no individual recognition, and also because brands are less popular than the same Samsung, - Huawei and ZTE have no choice but to dump at a price with all other characteristics of the products.  This, of course, also makes a profit, but, I think, the division of Huawei and ZTE devices is still not very profitable, if not at all subsidized. <br><br>  In connection with all this, I am extremely interested in the recent statement made by Huawei representatives that they say the company plans to develop its own mobile operating system.  The statement is, however, at a press breakfast in a cafe Pushkin, Director of Marketing for the regional office of Huawei Device in Russia and the CIS, essentially could not comment, saying that Android, Windows 8 and Windows Phone 8 are priority software platforms for Huawei , and we can talk about our new OSes only if the above mentioned software platforms are doing badly.  In short, no operating system from Huawei, at least in the near future, we should not wait. <br><br>  By the way, if we are talking about Windows 8, then it‚Äôs not worth mentioning that the Huawei MediaPad 10 FHD tablet also has a keyboard docking station, which was demonstrated at the press breakfast, but they don‚Äôt give it a test yet. she will go on sale a little later.  In short, MediaPad 10 FHD is actually not just a tablet, but rather a transformer, reminiscent of Asus‚Äôs development in the field of a tablet-netbook form factor. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/fd0/528/6e7/fd05286e7385f54096c2874bec4472ce.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/03b/61c/7d8/03b61c7d89e4df8bfa6c190edd7bb37f.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Anyway, speaking of the user interface, I‚Äôm getting at it.  Recently, a young Finnish startup Jolla Mobile, consisting of former Nokia employees working on the Maemo &amp; MeeGo project, said that Cyberport managed to attract 200 million investments to develop the new mobile operating system Silfish based on the Hong Kong IT cluster.  It is noteworthy that it was the Chinese side who became interested in a promising start-up in the asset of the employees of which there are some very, very thorough, and in some circles even religious icons. <br><br>  However, Jolla employees have experience in creating software for mobile devices, the experience, without exaggeration, is remarkable, but in terms of hardware, the employees who were engaged in this aspect of device development at Maemo &amp; MeeGo, remained to work at Nokia. <br><br>  At the same time, Huawei and ZTE are doing just fine with the hardware, but not really with the direction of the user interface.  So their ability to assemble devices could be very productively combined with the ability of Jolla employees to create unique interface shells for devices.  It would not be superfluous to recall that Jolla has already announced that their new OS will support applications from the Play Market for Android.  In a word, I am sure that all these components can give a generally very interesting and relevant product for the market. <br><br>  And one more thing I would like to say in connection with all this.  Personally, I confess the concept: one device - one software platform.  Therefore, I would like the manufacturers, creating this or that device, not only to string an android or win8 on it, but to create integral, single devices.  So the interface win8 literally before our eyes is now giving rise to new devices.  Ideally, I would like it to be so with all other devices.  But, apparently, this is an unattainable dream, because the market needs momentum, not ideal and ergonomic devices.  That is why the android is so popular, contributing to the extensive development of the market.  Therefore, I am sure that the same fate awaits both Win8 and WP8. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/5fa/8ae/045/5fa8ae045cf13e1e6f6c707542c9b7a5.jpg" alt="image"></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/156081/">https://habr.com/ru/post/156081/</a></p>
