We continue a series of posts about legal content on the net.  <a href="http://geektimes.ru/company/ulmart/blog/250248/">The last time</a> it was about music services, today in the sight of our attention resources with serials and movies.  Of course, so with what than, the Internet is rich in resources with movies and TV shows.  Too much.  But how many of them are portals with legally placed content?  It is unlikely that there will be at least half of the first few dozen links in the issuance of any search engine for queries like ‚Äúfree licensed films‚Äù. <br><br> <a href="http://geektimes.ru/company/ulmart/blog/250400/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e4c/c8e/5fa/e4cc8e5fa9e34f8e9f18e8bbb3174a60.jpg"></a> <br><br>  And this is already a problem, even if we leave aside the moral side of the question of using content of dubious origin, because pirated resources often do not differ in their responsible attitude towards users.  And often it is generally unsafe to use them - they will force someone to send mail to someone, then they will give them something.  Therefore, knowing where to legally watch movies and TV shows for free or for a modest fee is useful in any case - even if websites with unlicensed content do not suffer from the updated anti-piracy law and continue to function. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  First, let's talk a little about one extremely popular technology that sets the weather today in the virtual market for legal video production.  It's about smart TV.

    <h2>  <font color="#e40136">Smart tv</font> </h2><br>  What is Smart TV?  In short, this is a software platform that allows the TV (or receiver) to directly access online interactive resources.  If at all in a nutshell - this is a software for connecting the TV to the Internet.  The technology supporting this technology makes it possible to painlessly abandon regular television broadcasting - the user can choose what to watch and when.  In addition, Smart TV allows you to use social networks via TV, access news resources and, for example, store photo collections.  In short - TV with Smart TV is actually a powerful multimedia center, almost comparable to a working computer or laptop.  Now more than 90% of modern TVs are equipped with this platform. <br><br>  The advent of interactive television has strongly spurred the development of sites and applications for access to legal video content, whether it be movies, TV shows or broadcasts.  It is the tendency to ‚Äúmake friends‚Äù with Smart TV now that this market is driving.  However - fortunately!  - about ordinary Internet users, who for various reasons do not like pirated content, have not been forgotten.  In this article we will look at what popular online cinemas are in RuNet.  To support smart TV and mobile gadgets, but they also necessarily worked through the web interface, had a more or less extensive base of the presented content and it is desirable that at least part of it is provided free of charge.  One problem with Smart TV and software for it: the developers could not agree, and now the platforms and their versions simply do not count.  Zoo is worse than Android devices 3-4 years ago. <br><br>  Samsung has its own platform, it is alone, it looks in the style of TouchWiz on Android smartphones.  <a href="http://www.ulmart.ru/catalog/tvs_6020_64991%3Fsort%3D0%26viewType%3D1%26rec%3Dfalse%26filters%3D%26brands%3D60">Televisions are</a> quite popular, so the software for this platform is always a car and a cart. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/406/474/1db/4064741db2cd037e878df0c9d5408f74.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Another popular manufacturer, <a href="http://www.ulmart.ru/catalog/tvs_6020_64991%3Fsort%3D0%26viewType%3D1%26rec%3Dtrue%26filters%3D%26brands%3D83">LG</a> , recently changed one Smart TV system to another: it was something of its own, it became ... wow, it's scary to even say.  In general, they adapted the dead WebOS OSes for TVs now, which HP had long ago created as an Android killer on tablets.  So technically webOS is no longer dead, but still.  If you take a new TV and want to use Smart features to the fullest, make sure SmartTV is on the current platform, since all models with the previous generation of software are expected to be left without updates and improvements. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/295/bf1/f02/295bf1f0297bc80a4a302cf273593973.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The third most popular in the world are Sony's SmartTV <a href="http://www.ulmart.ru/catalog/tvs_6020_64991%3Fsort%3D0%26viewType%3D1%26rec%3Dfalse%26filters%3D%26brands%3D2">systems</a> .  They have a distinctive Sony design, made in the same style with the PlayStation and Xperia phones, but with the applications on the platform it can be so-so.  In general, if you have a huge choice of Koreans, you should not get involved with the Japanese miracle of technology just for the sake of SmartTV. <br><br>  Close the chain of popular smart TV systems products of <a href="http://www.ulmart.ru/catalog/tvs_6020_64991%3Fsort%3D0%26viewType%3D1%26rec%3Dfalse%26filters%3D%26brands%3D86">Phillips</a> .  Inside - quite strongly cut Android.  On the one hand, there should be no problems with the software.  On the other hand, the Android platform, nevertheless, was created as a mobile one, and tablet apps designed for a touch screen look somewhat strange at 30-40 inches and are managed unusually. <br><br>  Okay, back to the licensed content.  Begin, of course, with the megapopular <b><a href="http://www.ivi.ru/">ivi.ru</a></b> resource. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#e40136">ivi.ru</font> </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ab0/60b/38f/ab060b38f0914d66a36e8718d87a4caa.png"><br><br>  At the moment, this is the largest in RuNet catalog of films, cartoons and serials - more than 65 thousand titles - than the resource in the first place and stands out among competitors.  And almost 60 thousand of tapes are completely free for viewing on any platform, but accompanied by advertising.  The rest of the films are either unlimitedly available by subscription (429 rubles for 30 days), or bought separately (from 99 rubles for a picture). <br><br>  The resource supports various video stream quality up to Full HD, but unfortunately it cannot boast of good sound.  Maximum - 160 kb / s.  Of the less serious shortcomings of the service can be noted the lack of subtitles and original voice acting.  However, the mass user does not need it. <br><br>  The second should definitely consider the portal <b><a href="http://www.zoomby.ru/">Zoomby</a></b> .  For the reason that it is <b>completely</b> free.  Completely from the word at all. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#e40136">Zoomby</font> </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/60d/679/3f9/60d6793f99204d7c9d0f98050e7e268f.png"><br><br>  Although the user pays for free by the lack of subtitles, original voice acting, and HD quality above 720p (there is only 720p, designated as ‚Äúhigh‚Äù and ‚Äúaverage‚Äù, it‚Äôs not quite clear what quality level is appropriate, but acceptable), the resource has a large a catalog of films and serials (almost 40 thousand positions), and the programs shown on federal television channels also appear here promptly.  Also worth noting is not annoying advertising and user-friendly interface (optimization, however, pumped up - often "lags" when scrolling). <br><br>  The next very popular resource in our selection is <a href="http://megogo.net/ru"><b>Megogo</b></a> . <br><br><h2>  <font color="#e40136">Megogo</font> </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/92c/d56/98f/92cd5698f0004f20b23516dda540e421.png"><br><br>  With volumes of content everything is more modest here - about 6 and a half thousand titles.  But a subscription to the premium catalog costs only 299 rubles per month, and only premiere tapes are sold here by the piece.  And here is a good recommendation system based on the watched movies and the ability to memorize the place of viewing.  With the quality of sound and video and compatibility with the main platforms, Megogo also has no problems, the optimization is generally extremely conscientious, so the service can be called among the best in Runet. <br><br>  In many ways, similar to the previous resource - <a href="http://www.tvzavr.ru/"><b>TVzavr</b></a> . <br><br><h2>  <font color="#e40136">Tvzavr</font> </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/587/380/0f1/5873800f177c49dea36f816f2a5adfe4.png"><br><br>  Subscribing to premium content costs 179 rubles, for 99 you can simply turn off advertising while viewing free pictures.  Although the price difference is insignificant, it is still pleasant to turn off advertising without buying a subscription.  Premiere and more actual tapes are sold individually for one viewing (cheap).  Video quality is available in two versions (standard and HD, exact bitrates are not specified), for some of the content it is possible to turn on subtitles and change the voice acting to the original one.  In general, a resource for a mass user who is used to saving and not used to messing with the development of interfaces and hardware.  The total number of paintings in the catalog, unfortunately, is not indicated anywhere, but offhand here is an extensive and fairly high-quality selection - in any case, there are some world hits like ‚ÄúShoushenk Escape‚Äù. <br><br>  Then we have a site in our selection that was predicted to close or merge with competitors due to its generosity - <a href="http://www.now.ru/"><b>Now</b></a> . <br><br><h2>  <font color="#e40136">Now</font> </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/963/7e0/1bf/9637e01bf5914f1fa0546f21a821e680.png"><br><br>  Yes, Now really pursued a fairly loyal policy - among the free content there were even tapes in 3D!  True, the situation is different now, which apparently allowed the resource to survive.  Most of the content is available for free viewing with advertising;  separate films can be obtained for a fee - not more than 50 rubles.  True, the portal‚Äôs drawbacks are also quite significant - leaving much to be desired optimization (films, for example, often hang tight when scrolling), inconvenient web-interface usability and surprisingly mean help.  In general, Now is a budget option. <br><br>  For those moviegoers who are willing to pay for maximum convenience and quality, there is <a href="http://okko.tv/"><b>Okko</b></a> service, in the past Play. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#e40136">Okko</font> </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/34e/a69/5c8/34ea695c870d400c9e20b76824738429.png"><br><br>  Okko first focused on mobile devices and Smart TV, and therefore even stopped supporting the application under the PC.  Using the web interface, you can still use the resource, and web users make up a large part of its audience.  However, now the main goal of the project is the owners of smart TVs.  And for them, Okko really looks like the best choice on the market - it‚Äôs a joke, affordable picture quality up to Full HD and 3D (but, of course, for absolutely the entire catalog), Dolby 5.1 sound, original voice acting and subtitles, premieres of new products along with their launch rental in cinemas, and even the ability to download some pictures on external media.  Impressive, right?  It is clear that this functionality can not be free even with advertising.  So Okko offers exclusively paid content, and the price for one movie can reach several hundred rubles, which is comparable to going to the cinema.  The resource catalog is relatively modest - about 5,500 titles, but it is well-composed. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#e40136">Google play movie</font> </h2><br>  <a href="https://play.google.com/store/movies%3Fhl%3Dru"><b>Google Play Movies is</b></a> also fully paid.  Although the help to the resource says that there are few free serials in the database, they were not found.  Apparently, we live in the wrong country. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/cc3/372/32d/cc337232d5e04ad6a188851eeba669f8.png"><br><br>  The service is a player built into the Google Play store for playback and a library for storing purchased content.  Tapes can both be bought ‚Äúfor good‚Äù or rented.  Prices range from a few dozen to 400-500 rubles.  HD quality and change of sound tracks are available in most positions.  Some movies can be downloaded to mobile devices and watch offline, but only through the official service application.  A distinctive feature is the ability to get pictures bought on solid media free of charge in the library, if there are special promotional codes for them. <br><br>  Let us mention one more fully paid resource, since we are talking about those.  This is <a href="http://ayyo.ru/"><b>Ayyo</b></a> . <br><br><h2>  <font color="#e40136">Ayyo</font> </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/239/ed9/5cd/239ed95cd96048e880b7915c7d215100.png"><br><br>  At first glance, the resource is quite far behind any of the competitors listed above - each film is bought separately and only for 48 hours; most of the presented tapes cannot boast of particularly good image and sound quality.  But - a simple and intuitive interface, a good choice and reasonable prices.  In addition, a very convenient tag search system ("constructor").  "Ayyo" is suitable for those who watch movies just on a computer or tablet, and does not do it very often. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#e40136">Conclusion</font> </h2><br>  Despite the fact that it is still possible to get unlicensed content in RuNet without special dances with a tambourine, the demand for legal is very high, and demand, as is known, gives rise to supply.  Films and series as the most popular cultural products (and, what‚Äôs already there, as the most protected by anti-piracy law) today have become the most offered type of legal content on the net.  It is a lot of offers - choose on the taste and a purse. <br><br>  As in the article about music services, it is on duty to note that the resources listed in this material make up only a small part of all that Runet offers.  There is also, for example, <a href="http://www.amediateka.ru/">Amediatek</a> with an excellent TV series base, there is a Russian-Ukrainian project <a href="http://divan.tv/ru/">Divan.tv</a> , a controversial <a href="http://www.tvigle.ru/">TVigle</a> , for Apple users there is the same ITunes (where you can go without it), many excellent documentaries can be found on the websites of TV channels that released their.  We looked at the very cream of the Russian segment of the Internet.  A brief summary of them is in the table below. <br><br><table><tbody><tr><td width="70">  <b>Service</b> <br></td><td>  <b>Content</b> <br></td><td width="140">  <b>Free viewing</b> </td><td width="150">  <b>Advertising</b> <br></td><td>  <b>Rates</b> <br><br></td></tr><tr><td>  <a href="http://www.ivi.ru/">ivi.ru</a> <br></td><td>  65 thousand films, serials and programs <br></td><td>  Yes, with advertising <br></td><td>  Non-switchable in free positions <br></td><td>  Free / 429 rubles for 30 days / selected items from 99 rubles for hire <br></td></tr><tr><td>  <a href="http://www.zoomby.ru/">Zoomby</a> <br></td><td>  40 thousand films, serials and programs <br></td><td>  Yes, with advertising <br></td><td>  Non-switchable <br></td><td>  Everything is free <br></td></tr><tr><td>  <a href="http://megogo.net/ru">Megogo</a> <br></td><td>  6500 movies, TV shows and programs <br></td><td>  Yes, with advertising <br></td><td>  Non-switchable in free positions <br></td><td>  Free / 299 rubles monthly subscription / from 99 rubles for rent and from 199 for purchase <br></td></tr><tr><td>  <a href="http://www.tvzavr.ru/">Tvzavr</a> <br></td><td>  3000 hours of free content;  several hundred paid positions <br></td><td>  Yes, with advertising <br></td><td>  Disabled in free positions <br></td><td>  Free / 179 rubles subscription / 99 rubles off advertising <br></td></tr><tr><td>  <a href="http://www.now.ru/">Now</a> <br></td><td>  Not specified <br></td><td>  Yes, with advertising <br></td><td>  Non-switchable in free positions <br></td><td>  Free / from 50 rubles for the purchase <br></td></tr><tr><td>  <a href="http://okko.tv/">Okko</a> <br></td><td>  5500 movies and TV shows <br></td><td>  Only trailers <br></td><td>  Not <br></td><td>  From 79 rubles for the purchase <br></td></tr><tr><td>  <a href="https://play.google.com/store/movies%3Fhl%3Dru">Google play movie</a> <br></td><td>  Several thousand movies and TV shows <br></td><td>  Only trailers <br></td><td>  Not <br></td><td>  From 49 rubles for rent and from 199 rubles for the purchase <br></td></tr><tr><td>  <a href="http://ayyo.ru/">Ayyo</a> <br></td><td>  Not specified <br></td><td>  Only trailers <br></td><td>  Not <br></td><td>  From 80 rubles for hire <br></td></tr></tbody></table><br>  In the next article - the final in the series - we will figure out where you can read in RuNet without crossing the road to some book Mikhalkov. <br><br>  <b>Our reviews:</b> <br>  <b>¬ª</b> <a href="http://geektimes.ru/company/ulmart/blog/248110/">Connect original gamepads to PC</a> <br>  <b>¬ª</b> <a href="http://geektimes.ru/company/ulmart/blog/247942/">Razer Abyssus: the most affordable Razer</a> <br>  <a href="http://geektimes.ru/company/ulmart/blog/247626/">Nikon 1 S2: one-button mirrorless</a> <br>  <b>¬ª</b> <a href="http://geektimes.ru/company/ulmart/blog/246340/">Lenovo Miix 3-1030 Review</a> <br>  <b>¬ªWe</b> <a href="http://geektimes.ru/company/ulmart/blog/245854/">understand the art-chaos of the company Wacom</a> <br>  <b>¬ª</b> <a href="http://geektimes.ru/company/ulmart/blog/245646/">ASUS ZenFone 5, LG L90, HTC Desire 601 - a two-part war for the consumer, part 1</a> <br>  <b>¬ª</b> <a href="http://geektimes.ru/company/ulmart/blog/245210/">ASUS Transformer Pad</a> <br>  <b>¬ª</b> <a href="http://geektimes.ru/company/ulmart/blog/245040/">Razer Kraken headsets</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/367061/">https://habr.com/ru/post/367061/</a></p>
