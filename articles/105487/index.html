  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Verizon will pay its customers 90 million for wrong bills</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  At Habr√©, there are often reports that such and such a mobile operator (mostly complaining about Russian and Ukrainian Opsos), made a lot of money for some reason.  A positive solution to such problems is very rare - most often the operators just keep silent, although, of course, there are exceptions.  An interesting example for comparison can be the situation with one of the largest US mobile operators, Verizon.  This company had (almost voluntarily, after the intervention of the Federal Communications Commission) to pay about $ 90 million to customers who were sent the wrong bills. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>  The number of customers who received erroneous accounts reaches 15 million people - and all of them were returned funds.  The total amount of 90 million is perhaps the largest such payment in the entire history of communications operators.  The fact is that Verizon periodically made a mistake in charge of funds, and customers received bills for services that they did not use and which were not connected at all (for example, using some tariff plans for working on the Internet via a mobile device). <br><br>  The company found that these 15 million customers had been sent bills in excess of $ 2 to $ 6 over a period of several years.  These funds were returned, and that is especially significant, the money was returned even to former customers who no longer use Verizon‚Äôs communications services.

      <br>
      It is also worth noting that Verizon returned money to existing customers in the form of mobile account replenishment (from October to November), and checks were sent to former customers (for amounts from 2 to 6 dollars, as indicated above). <br><br>  The US Federal Communications Commission intervened after it had already received several hundred, if not thousands, requests from customers of this mobile operator about improperly charging funds for services that customers did not use.  To clarify the situation, the FCC turned to Verizon, which began analyzing archive and current accounts.  After briefly working with the accounts, the company apologized for the mistake, and promised to restore justice by returning the money to the affected clients. <br><br>  For some reason it seems to me that if domestic telecom operators started checking their own accounts (at least by court decision), then the amounts accrued to customers ‚Äúby mistake‚Äù would probably exceed $ 90 million.  After all, we have these "mistakes" often far exceed the unfortunate $ 2, as is the case with the Americans.  It is clear that no one will recount anything here.  Even if the court decides something there, our companies will find a way out without returning the funds ... <br><br>  Via <a href="http://news.cnet.com/8301-1035_3-20018381-94.html">CNET</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/105487/">https://habr.com/ru/post/105487/</a></p>
