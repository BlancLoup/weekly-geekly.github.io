For example:

    <ul><li>  The police car today has become a real mobile office using a large amount of information technology.  It has several IT systems (PC, local positioning system, cameras, sensors) that require bi-directional high-speed, secure and reliable communications. </li><li>  The enterprises use a wide range of sensors and video cameras to monitor production processes and ensure safe and non-stop operation.  These sensors are often mounted in hard-to-reach places and require reliable and secure communication. </li><li>  Today in public places there are many surveillance cameras that help to ensure security.  These cameras require high-speed and reliable communications to broadcast video (mainly in one direction) to centralized systems. </li><li>  Many hospitals use network-connected medical equipment to track their location and quickly locate the nearest device.  In this case, reliable low-speed connections are used for a wide range of devices. </li></ul><br><h3>  A variety of requirements for connecting IoT devices to the network </h3><br>  In addition to a wide range of applications for relevant technologies, there are literally hundreds of different types of devices and sensors for the Internet of Things.  Each type has its own unique requirements, including the number of connections, the cost of connection, the availability of power sources and the parameters of bidirectional data transfer. <br><br>  Depending on your application, IoT networks will require scalable, reliable, and secure connections to communicate with remote devices and sensors.  The most difficult, perhaps, is to provide low-cost communication with remote devices, some of which will use self-contained power supplies. <br><br><h3>  IoT network requirements </h3><br>  Depending on the specific devices and applications for the Internet of Things, you will need to provide: <br><br><ul><li>  the ability to connect a large number of heterogeneous elements of the Internet of Things; </li><li>  high reliability; </li><li>  data transmission in real time with minimal delays; </li><li>  the ability to protect all traffic flows; </li><li>  the ability to program to customize applications; <br></li><li>  device level traffic monitoring and control; <br></li><li>  inexpensive communication for a large number of devices and (or) sensors. </li></ul><br>  Complying with this list of requirements is difficult, it is possible that IT managers will even have to provide support for several types of network connections, taking into account applications of IoT technologies. <br><br><h3>  Impact of SDN and NFV on the structure of the Internet of Things </h3><br>  Thanks to new software-defined networks, such as SDN, NFV and SD-WAN, network architects have received new tools for developing flexible networks.  NFV and SDN provide technologies for customizing networks to the requirements of the Internet of Things.  NFV offers many virtual network functions (VNFs), including routing, security, gateways and traffic management, which can be combined to deploy custom network services for the Internet of things.  SDN provides centralized control and management of data flow across large-scale distributed IoT networks. <br><br><h3>  Challenges related to big data </h3><br>  IoT networks can create huge amounts of data, some of which can be analyzed in real time.  Given the delays and bandwidth limitations, not all data can or should be analyzed centrally.  IoT networks will require distributed analytics and business analytics, which are often performed on end devices or somewhere else on the periphery of the network. <br><br><h3>  Internet of Things Design Issues </h3><br>  There are a number of factors that IT managers must take into account when planning for the Internet of Things.  Level 1 questions: What type of devices or sensors will be connected?  How many devices will there be?  How much traffic is expected?  By answering these questions, it will be possible to plan connection options, as well as roughly calculate the network budget, including capital costs and operating expenses. <br><br>  You also need to answer the following key questions: <br><br><ul><li>  Will devices / sensors be stationary or mobile? </li><li>  What are the security requirements at the device level? <br></li><li>  Do I need to analyze IoT data in real time? <br></li><li>  Should the network and IT system monitor the activity of the device or do they mainly play a passive role? <br></li><li>  Does a particular device / sensor have access to an AC power source? <br></li></ul><br><br><h3>  Communications Technologies for the Internet of Things </h3><br>  IT managers have a wide range of opportunities to communicate with devices and sensors of the Internet of Things.  Each option has its advantages and disadvantages depending on the application. <br><br>  Four network technologies that are widely used today and can become the main one for the Internet of Things: <br><br><ul><li>  Bluetooth wireless technology is embedded in many devices, including smartphones, but this technology has a limited range and does not guarantee reliability. <br></li><li>  Wi-Fi is universal, it is used for PCs, smartphones and tablets, but it uses a lot of energy to maintain uninterrupted communication. <br></li><li>  4G LTE technology is widespread and provides high speed, but can be expensive with large amounts of data and consumes a lot of energy. <br></li><li>  Ethernet provides high-speed LAN connections to most branch offices and campuses, but a physical cable is required to connect to IoT devices. <br></li></ul><br>  In addition, a number of new network technologies have emerged that were developed specifically for connecting IoT devices.  These include: <br><br><ul><li>  The Internet of Things is based on cellular networks (several standards, including LTE-M, NB LTE-M and NB-IOT). </li><li>  Low-power geographically distributed networks, such as SigFox and LoRa, which are designed specifically for devices with low power consumption (powered only from autonomous sources). </li><li>  ZigBee is a wireless standard designed for machine-to-machine networks, providing low cost and minimal power consumption. </li></ul><br><h3>  The impact of the Internet of Things on branch and campus networks </h3><br>  An important factor for many IT organizations is the impact of the new IoT networks on existing branch and campus networks, as well as distributed networks (WAN).  IoT devices can create new traffic patterns, generate large data flows, and have unique delay requirements. <br><br>  <b>Branch network</b> <br><br>  A department's network is usually a moderate number of devices connected via Ethernet and Wi-Fi.  Most branch offices do not have trained IT staff, so networks must be managed remotely.  IT organizations are moving to technologies such as SD-WAN and SD-Branch to take advantage of cost-effective capabilities to meet growing WAN bandwidth requirements and simplify the creation and administration of a remote network.  Connecting IoT devices to branch offices may lead to the emergence of new network technologies to be administered, and lead to problems associated with the need for remote troubleshooting and device management;  in addition, it is often necessary to increase the capacity of the WAN.  Some applications of the Internet of Things technology may require significant local computing power and large data stores. <br><br>  <b>Campus network</b> <br><br>  A campus network may consist of a large number of devices (PCs, tablets, smartphones, printers, etc.) connected via Wi-Fi and Ethernet with a high-performance backbone for establishing connections with the data center in the organization.  Where a campus network is deployed, there is usually trained IT staff to solve network problems associated with increased delays, interruptions in service, etc. When you deploy the Internet of Things based on the campus network, new networks can be created to connect remote sensors. This significantly increases the number of connected devices and often there are problems associated with device management, authentication and overload of the existing Wi-Fi network. <br><br>  Intelligent IT based on connected devices and IoT sensors help organizations better serve customers, deliver goods faster, and reduce costs by improving operational efficiency.  A local or distributed network is in any case a critical element in terms of deploying secure, reliable, and high-speed Internet of Things.  The unique requirements of the Internet systems of certain types of things, lead to the need to implement new options for network connections and affect existing networks of branches and campuses.  Many IT organizations found it difficult to implement the Internet of Things platforms that meet high reliability requirements, guarantee low delays and high security, and provide centralized management. <br><br>  To create a network architecture that is suitable for connecting IoT devices, IT organizations must analyze a large number of options.  IT managers need to carefully assess the current requirements of the Internet of things from the point of view of bandwidth (in both directions), reliability, security and cost.  Requirements for the Internet of Things and device connectivity will continue to evolve.  Network architectures need to be flexible and adaptable to meet changing business requirements. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/355026/">https://habr.com/ru/post/355026/</a></p>
