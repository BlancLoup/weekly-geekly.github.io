  <section class="page js-page"><h1>At the presentation of the Samsung Galaxy S3</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  On the 4th, a <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/samsung/blog/145199/">topic</a> flashed on the desktop about the presentation of the Samsung flagship phone.  In general, I have never been to such events, so it was decided to attend the presentation.  The good news was that it was held at a relatively convenient time for me, as well as the venue: The Ritz-Carlton Hotel Ballroom.  For those who do not know - this building is almost next to the Red Square and is quite pathetic.  Thus, I decided to feel the beautiful and join the pathos. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  By the cherished meeting place left in advance and did not lose.  On the way to the hotel I met a group of curious people who were looking at something on the opposite side of the street.  Looking at this opposite side of the street, I saw the building of the State Duma and a funny sight: two guys stood with the numbers 31, and below was a crowd of onlookers and journalists.  It can be seen that people came prepared: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/dc8/8a3/023/dc88a30232cc00fcbfd64b74e0f5632e.jpg"><br><br>  As it turned out, there were also prepared people in the form of:

Further came, in fact, to the hotel and went inside.  I went up to the second floor and checked in.  The password turned out to be simple: ‚ÄúI am with a habrahabr‚Äù, they gave me a badge and I suddenly became a press: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/d50/12a/519/d5012a519bc55f8c91fa415ed22e6472.jpg"><br><br>  Along the way, you could have a snack and drink tea / coffee with croissants and other goodies: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/2a5/c02/2e0/2a5c022e0172edb46788ed5386e8a971.jpg"><br><br>  Somewhere in the beginning of the first hour they started to run into the hall where the main part of the presentation was held.  I modestly sat in the second row and waited for the main action: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/3b7/ba5/78f/3b7ba578f496c45e7aa6a51cc610c82e.jpg"><br><br>  And so the report began (in the picture: the disappearing number ‚Äú2‚Äù): <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/a6c/e7a/20a/a6ce7a20a5696d4c0d45aa33d7a3d06b.jpg"><br><br>  The video started, saying that this is the world premiere, and that this event was also held and will be held in other cities and villages on our planet Earth: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/c7d/682/755/c7d6827551317e27278cb694d5d151af.jpg"><br><br>  They were the first to give the floor to Mr. Jan Sang-Ho, President of Samsung Electronics Headquarters for CIS countries.  He told about the wonderful and advanced features of the smartphone, which I will omit, because  much has been said about them <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/samsung/blog/143262/">before</a> .  I would like to mention the advanced technique of performance: in the photo you can see 2 translucent mirrors, onto which the text for the speaker was projected.  Perhaps for some it is a common thing, but I came across this for the first time: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/84a/57a/9ae/84a57a9ae66518b889155abfba17f46a.jpg"><br><br>  I will not speak about the fact that this is the best smartphone in its class, but I‚Äôll only give you a picture: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/485/eca/f5a/485ecaf5a07900d57aef5881dfeb3c23.jpg"><br><br>  At the end of his speech, the President of the countries showed the hall white and blue smartphones.  The hall did not remain in debt and responded with applause and fierce camera flashes: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/f39/230/690/f3923069098993637d83dc5873a28022.jpg"><br><br>  Further performance was continued in Russian.  The speaker began cheerfully: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/218/1aa/89c/2181aa89ce0fb618ca59da9c0a441db8.jpg"><br><br>  but in the end it began to falter occasionally.  Apparently, more often rehearsed the first part of the report.  It was further proposed to go and feel the beauty: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/326/06c/b35/32606cb351c489b73cce0eafca4e52ef.jpg"><br><br>  Around the harsh men rushed to the cameras: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/fbf/f96/65f/fbff9665f19ad863c46778f03ce05a95.jpg"><br><br>  We photographed everything for everything: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/c9f/184/174/c9f18417420ff8693071d0e985f4d873.jpg"><br><br>  A novelty was considered and felt a considerable number of people: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/bbb/4dd/d93/bbb4ddd9337f731680fac4f1da4f04b3.jpg"><br><br>  Immediately at the exit from the <s>ballroom</s> presentation room they were given a gift: a discount on the purchase of a phone and delicious cookies.  Then you could dine all sorts of tasty food, such as mango meat salad.  Unusually, it should be noted for the rich. <br><br>  At the exit from the hotel we were met by a crowd of young people, all unusual and bright personalities: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/1ba/dee/288/1badee28833c2d68731524987e81a0ab.jpg"><br><br>  What they wanted and, most importantly, why, could not figure out.  At this presentation, as I understood, came to an end. <br><br>  All photos, as well as others that are not included in this article, can be viewed by <a href="https://plus.google.com/photos/117094911342404646647/albums/5750626127993754721">clicking</a> on this <a href="https://plus.google.com/photos/117094911342404646647/albums/5750626127993754721">link (girls are available)</a> . <br><br>  <b>PS</b> I myself am not a fan of the Samsung brand.  Just shared my observations.  I was very interested to know from the inside how the presentations look.  In general, the event very much and was held at a high level.  If we talk about the phone, the phone is excellent, it looks not like a piece of plastic in hands, but as a solid monolithic device that is pleasant to hold.  We'll have to take. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/145296/">https://habr.com/ru/post/145296/</a></p>
