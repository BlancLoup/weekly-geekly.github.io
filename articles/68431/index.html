  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The new site of the Kremlin</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"> The Kremlin has updated the <a href="http://kremlin.ru/">site</a> .  The project for such an "institution" should be a model.  Let's see what is the main website of the country. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  <a href="http://a1.ua/ru/news/938.html">Version with illustrations</a> . <br><br>  The first thing you notice is the text of the headers.  Something is wrong with them.  One can argue for a long time that “the link should be a link - i.e.  underlined "or argue that highlighting the entire text in bold is the same as not highlighting it at all.  And it’s not even a ripple from the underlined headings of texts that make them hard to read.  Highlighting with color is illogical - this is what catches your eye: news headlines are blue (color: # 115682;) while Documents are black.  Let's leave aside a specific selection of colors (well, like this client and everything!), Back to the logic. 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>
        <script>
          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      1. If the news is blue and the documents are black, why is the News heading itself black, not blue?  Moreover, below "All news" - blue ... Ie  “News” and “All News” are entities of a different order. <br><br>  2. If heading links are underlined “because links” - why is “All news”, “All documents” not underlined, although the links are? <br><br>  3. If black is documents, and blue is news - then why in the block of announcements of the main news, when hovering, the blue headings turn black?  Do they become "documents"? <br><br>  4. "News map" - here and joy and sorrow: firstly, you clearly understand the simple truth of the truth - "in your region" - black, "in the world" - blue.  Those.  if you belong to the first - you - black “documents”, to the rest of the world - “blue” news.  The map itself causes ambivalent opinions: on the one hand, you can play a puzzle, on the other - bad associations.  When you hover the cursor on the area it "floods."  Taking into account S.-Shushenskiy affairs, entertainment for the enemies is “Flooding Russia”.  At the same time, it is not very clear what exactly you are flooding, because for some reason the region’s signature appears in the lower right-hand corner - so that the enemy will not immediately guess?  But in a prominent position a secondary element of navigation. <br><br>  5. “Agenda” - for those who are not fully aware of the message submitted in Clause 4 - “Anti-Corruption Plan”, “Support for Small Business”, “Modern Housing Market” is red, but with “Rule of Law”, citizens - black.  And that's it. <br><br>  6. The "Keywords" block is probably more important than anything else, since so much space is given to its cap.  In general, you can understand - it is necessary to show the present.  And the arrow treacherously looks "to the West." <br><br>  7. “Announcements” - no, the calendar icon here was not at all strange to see, on the contrary - logical.  At the same time, you don’t have to click on it — you don’t have to, the citizens know in advance — everything will be released in the allotted time. <br><br>  8. Similarly, things are with the search - it still needs to be searched.  Well, why do you need it?  See what they give and do not pick where it is not necessary.  However - the finder - a bonus, under the footer is another injection with a search.  Checked - the result is the same ... Where's the catch? <br><br>  9. Speaking of bonuses - next to the “lower” search - switching between language versions, which is typical - there are two of them, although there is one in the header.  What would it mean? <br><br>  10. Footer, by a strange coincidence, smiled toothlessly absent from the third block.  Well, if there are three columns, why not place it so that it does not cause?  “It is impossible to add“ widths to materials from 2000 to 2008 ”so that they are not so poorly tolerated?  Well, yes, what is there poking around. <br><br>  11. Returning to the header of the site (by the way, it was there that instead of the date there would be a place to be in the search path of the site).  Of course, Einstein also said that the amount of intelligence on the planet is constant and the population is growing, but is it worth seriously expecting that Internet users will go to the Kremlin’s website to find out the date instead of searching?  Or is it there - is it special and is it time to start getting used to the idea that at some point the time there might not be like HERE?  Although ... judging by the "Kursk" TAM, it may well be another time. <br><br>  12. Icons in the footer.  Apparently, it all started with the "Version for the Visually Impaired."  Or maybe with RSS?  Parts of the items got icons.  These are the already mentioned “Version for the visually impaired” and “RSS”, in addition to them “Mobile version” and Wap.  It is difficult to understand the logic of these preferences, in particular, taking into account that the “Subscription” located nearby and the icons did not get.  Apparently nothing was invented, but they forgot about the envelope.  On the “Search” logic completely failed and the association refused completely.  Judge for yourself - well, what can you specify as an “Search” icon?  Dilemma… <br><br>  13. About the "version for the visually impaired."  I respect those who think of those who cannot do something without neglect, but with care.  Because of this, speaking critically about the “version for the visually impaired” seems cynical.  In short, the idea is generally correct.  A couple of moments: you should probably think about the fact that people, thank B. do not go blind when they get on this site, and if a person has vision problems, then he (or he / she) makes the appropriate settings at the operating system level as a whole, and not at the level of a single site.  However, how to solve - if there is something useful for people, even if it is redundant - it is better than nothing or it would be better to make ratchets at traffic lights for the visually impaired or a couple of extra inclined in the crossings for wheelchairs? <br><br>  14. The “rubricator” pleased with its truthfulness - everything is, in fact, the “media” in the final place. <br><br>  15. The same attitude can be seen in the column “About the site” - the block “About the development of the site” - higher and more important than “Leave to the editor”.  Well, what to write-disturb?  But "On the development"!  The action is epochal in itself. <br><br>  16. "Themes".  Due to the deterioration of the specifics of the activity, the first thought was the option of changing the skins (“Themes” aka “Skins”) on the site.  Bumping into a link (by the way, also with a “Western” orientation - maybe it prompted the possible presence of something familiar?) In short, a strange gray block appears in which - Bingo!  - we learn the style of "Keywords".  I will not discuss how much the tag cloud and rubricator are equal elements.  If desired, you can pull one to the other.  What grieved in what he saw was not so much the hypertrophied “up” arrow in the “Keywords” style (compare them for the sake of Hochma) - this, among those discussed above, is not the worst sin.  Another thing grieved - again they stuck the truth with the funeral mob of headlines: “Rule of Law”, “Institutes, infrastructure, innovations, investments, intellect” (as far as clear, sad and to the point!), “Personnel reserve”, “Quality medicine” "," Our New School "," Energy Efficient Economy "- like the last nail.  Everything, you can lower ... <br><br>  17. The last item is not the last.  In fact, he is the first, but pointing it out would be inappropriate.  It seems like - the final chord should be clear, the last volley - bright.  At the same time, the considered causes other emotions and therefore I will finish, without commenting and not revealing badly concealed mathematical signs (who needs it - everyone will understand): <br><br>  RUSSIA STATE MEDVEDEV <br><br>  <strong>PS</strong> This text was born from the usual for fellow developers messaging <em>"How are you?" - "Made a new job" - "Show"</em> .  It is clear that in such a project the client dominates (you can understand and present HOW MUCH) and the developer is extremely difficult to defend his professional vision from ideologues, PR advisors and others.  This text describes only the title page.  Next - more wood.  Does it make sense to describe them all, with all the nuances, when everything is clear ... </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/68431/">https://habr.com/ru/post/68431/</a></p>
