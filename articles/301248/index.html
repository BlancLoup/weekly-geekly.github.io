  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Don't you have a minute to talk about C ++?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  As you can probably guess, a good deal of our work is related to programming.  Well, simply because it is the easiest known method of creating software.  The main development is being done in C ++, and it so coincided that we have quite strong C ++ programmers.  Comrades, they are sociable and periodically want to talk to smart people.  It would seem that we have a lot of them, we could talk with each other.  But no.  They are interested in communication with other programmers.  Therefore, we decided to gather a big meeting at which C ++ developers could communicate with each other, listen to a couple of interesting reports, share experiences. <br><br>  The meeting will be held in the framework of the CoLaboratory program, on the evening of May 24, in our Moscow office.  This time we decided to share with everyone who wishes the experience of using static analysis and organizing program performance testing.  What our experts Nikita Kakuyev and Nikolai Dyakonov will tell you about - very enthusiastic personalities. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>  Nikita, who, according to him, ‚Äúis a little keen on the development process in a broad sense,‚Äù has an interesting hobby - he is experimenting with static analysis.  As the main tool uses Clang Static Analyzer. 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>
        <script>
          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      Actually, Nikita began to get involved in static analysis long before he came to us, so he had considerable experience.  However, at Kaspersky Lab, he learned how to use the Clang Static Analyzer on really large projects that are built from a pile of small ones.  And this person is going to share his experience.  Well, along the way, he will tell you about compiler varnings - how to set them up, how to manage them, and, most importantly, how to make them work for a programmer. <br><br>  Nikolai also has an interesting hobby - he is keen on testing program performance.  And he will tell about the rake.  Rather, not quite.  He will talk about how to properly approach the organization of performance testing and about those rakes that we have already stepped on during our experiments.  The fact is that in fact, such information is not very much.  About code optimization in C ++ is a lot.  About application optimization - if you want you can find.  But it‚Äôs almost impossible to organize regular performance testing. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/3e9/3bd/5f4/3e93bd5f48244321acf0d2d2f1b72bbd.jpg" alt="image"><br>  Rake.  They have no direct relation to C ++ development. <br><br>  The uniqueness of his situation lies in the fact that, on the one hand, he was always engaged in C ++ programming, and on the other, he now works in a group of analysis and performance monitoring.  That is, one might say, made a hobby his work.  So, starting to engage in performance monitoring, he learned a lot of new things.  And since then, it has been eager to tell the rest of C ++ programmers the truth, so that they relate to code optimization more comprehensively and globally.  And in the process of writing to understand what it affects and how it does it. <br><br>  Yevgeny Bushtyrev will act as moderator of the event. <br><br>  Meeting program: <ul><li>  18:30 - 19:00 - Registration of participants. </li><li>  19:00 - 19:10 - Welcome words. </li><li>  19:10 - 20:10 - Static analysis in C ++.  Nikita Kakuev. </li><li>  20:10 - 20:30 - Coffee break. </li><li>  20:30 - 21:00 - Basics of performance testing.  Nikolai Dyakonov. </li><li>  21:00 - 21:20 - Q &amp; A session. </li><li>  21:20 - End of the meeting. </li></ul><br><br>  You can register for participation <a href="https://kas.pr/ZGs7">here</a> . <br><br>  In the future, we plan to hold similar meetings with C ++ developers on a regular basis.  Moreover, if you have topics that you would be interested to discuss at the next meetings, then we will be happy if you share them here in the comments or personally in the forum. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/301248/">https://habr.com/ru/post/301248/</a></p>
