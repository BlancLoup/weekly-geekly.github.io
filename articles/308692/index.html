The services of such data centers are needed by companies that cannot allow their services to be idle for a minute.  Underground data centers are protected from a number of possible problems.  With the ‚Äúbig land‚Äù they are connected only by communications and transport channels.

      Everything else is at a great depth, where there are no seasonal changes in temperature and weather conditions.  Underground data centers are not so rare.  Not so long ago, the Bahnhof company transformed the nuclear bunker in downtown Stockholm into its data center.  After evaluating the idea, Online.net decided to create its own data center in the nuclear bunker.  The object itself is located in Paris, at a depth of 26 meters. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The Bahnhof company had to work on its data center for several years - after all, it was necessary to take out a lot of breed, carry out communications, equip everything according to modern requirements.  Online.net has just started working with its object, but the work has already advanced quite far. <br><br>  Initially, the bunker served as a conventional bomb shelter for 90 people.  Built it in 1937.  Then, it was rebuilt.  It happened in 1964, just in time for the Cold War.  The bunker was expanded and strengthened, making it resistant to a possible attack with nuclear warheads.  The new version could accommodate 300 people.  The bunker is protected by a 10-meter layer of limestone and reinforced with concrete. <br><br>  Only a shelter in the event of a nuclear war was declassified in 1991.  In 2012, it was bought by Online.net.  Now it is converted into a data center.  Indoors it is planned to place data stores for archival copies of the company's clients' data. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/2ed/673/f85/2ed673f85ca21db96753b0458d545c0f.jpg" width="850"></div><br>  Here it was possible to generate energy with the help of a "muscular generator" in the event that the main power line is broken.  Of course, for the data center all this is no longer suitable. <br><br><h3>  What has been done </h3><br>  The premises were abandoned for 20 years.  There was no care and maintenance of the shelter in the normal state.  Now the premises had to be put in order.  In addition, they were deepened by a meter to increase the net volume.  In a number of premises it is planned to place backup power sources.  All equipment began to be delivered a few weeks ago. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a70/dd2/1a6/a70dd21a6f9c093706e04fd2d5770be5.jpg" width="850"></div><br>  An interesting find was made in the bunker, which was not mentioned in any of the old project documents.  This is a well with a depth of 40 meters with pumping equipment.  Surprisingly, the equipment worked all this time, and from the very beginning it was possible to take water samples.  As it turned out, there is a lot of sulphate in the water, so you cannot use it for the needs of the data center.  But it was decided to keep the well - all of a sudden, it will be decided to use it in any way. <br><br>  The project itself was named C14 project.  Its authors decided to make the future data center completely autonomous, so now generators, tons of batteries, UPS and other types of equipment are installed in the premises. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/fdd/480/64a/fdd48064abcdc44e25f83a6fc25eea02.jpg" width="850"></div><br>  Communications are gradually being laid.  In order to strengthen the rock, it was decided to build a metal frame and pour it with concrete. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/3dd/055/c37/3dd055c37665b069c9fa77538bf4edbf.jpg" width="850"></div><br>  Water can flow into the rooms from the top (however, limestone is not concrete), so we still had to invent an insulation system and remove moisture from the bunker.  Moisture infiltration is, but it is small.  Water supply increases in autumn and winter, as the amount of rain increases. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b6d/558/417/b6d558417f2d6cd15ad76bb475331116.jpg" width="850"></div><br>  All the holes and cracks were sealed in the walls and ceiling, all of which were reinforced with special cement and other materials (including resin). <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b46/970/ef3/b46970ef3cdfbf048dbd5a5cdf15ee00.jpg" width="850"></div><br>  After that, another layer of material was applied on the reinforced walls - this is both additional insulation and a decorative element. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/773/e45/fa5/773e45fa54c821c9a5d92dcc35476386.jpg" width="850"></div><br>  Work is still underway, they are scheduled to be completed in September 2016.  And in October, the new data center will begin work.  At the same time, the company will additionally tell about all the works that followed after the finishing of the premises - what equipment was imported, what the performance and other characteristics of the entire system were. <br><br><h3>  What will come of it? </h3><br>  As already mentioned, a secure data center.  How reliable and how it will look can be judged by similar projects. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/6ce/6cc/757/6ce6cc75706e3dff654d2bd3d5cef9f9.jpg"><br><br>  For example, last year the nuclear bunker, which is located near Frankfurt, was converted into a data center.  Its area is 6900 m2.  The bunker is located at a depth of 6 meters under the ground. <br><br>  Work on the conversion took a lot of time - two years.  Clients of DC are now the EU military and some other serious organizations.  It all began with the analysis of the original documentation on the bunker with a volume of 15 thousand pages. <br><br>  This DC is called <a href="http://www.bunker-erich.de/">Erwin Bunker</a> , it is managed by a team of 15 people.  About 4 million euros were spent on the data center. <br><br><h3>  BUNKER DataCenter from Ukraine </h3><br>  About five years ago, Ukraine also did a similar job, re-equipping the bunker into a data center.  Initially, everything looked like this. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/005/e12/5fc/005e125fc8aba0b04242ad8d7d235118.jpg" width="850"></div><br>  Then: <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/d7b93ec7/fbf05bdf/b87c59d6/53416d4a.jpg" width="850"></div><br>  And now like this <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/edd/82c/402/edd82c4029f97391d55b090fdfaaf6e9.jpg" width="850"></div><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b8a/14a/71a/b8a14a71ace74dd051d407288f3653d1.jpg" width="850"></div><br><h3>  Data Center in Stockholm </h3><br>  About this object mentioned above, and this data center, perhaps, is one of the most famous.  It is located at a depth of 30 meters in the granite cave of the Vita Park in Stockholm.  Previously, there was also a nuclear bunker and command center. <br><br>  In order to accommodate all that the data center needed, 3 992 cubic meters of granite had to be removed.  It took two years.  What worked out not only works well, but also looks futuristic. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/732/ef1/3eb/732ef13eba78fa632f8482335aad9b8a.jpg" width="850"></div><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/dca/034/e1b/dca034e1b3d77172da302fae1cd143c3.jpg" width="850"></div><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/822/b88/10a/822b8810ab9bdab0512a62b875c38e0c.jpg" width="850"></div><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/39b/4b3/6d7/39b4b36d71b3ef396385bd97a19d59c5.jpg" width="850"></div><br><h3>  Cyberbunker </h3><br>  Another data center located in a former nuclear bunker.  The bunker itself was built in the 50s.  In 1998, all this was bought out and later transformed into a data center. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/1da/ccb/090/1daccb090bcf90f83d22ab80c414cca5.jpg" width="850"></div><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/bc5/f24/087/bc5f240871139f37353e5f1d4bf03386.jpg" width="850"></div><br>  Now the whole structure of the DC consists of one underground level and four above ground levels.  Underground is protected most of all, it closes the five-meter layer of concrete walls and electromagnetic shields.  The total area of ‚Äã‚Äãall DC is about 5 square meters.  km  Preserved even protection against chemical and biological weapons. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/308692/">https://habr.com/ru/post/308692/</a></p>
