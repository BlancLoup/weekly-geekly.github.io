Tion creates and brings to the market both professional industrial and medical devices for air disinfection, as well as home appliances for ‚Äúsmart‚Äù ventilation and air purification. <br>  Recently, the company officially launched a new version of its product - the Tion O2 MAC breather, a compact household ventilation device that eliminates the stuffiness, street noise and dust in the apartment and works with the Tion MagicAir smart microclimate system.  The Tion MagicAir smart microclimate system measures indoor air quality, displays data on a smartphone and automatically controls the microclimate.  An official <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/tion/blog/277078/">announcement has</a> already been written, but we decided to ask around a little more and support our colleagues, because we love cloud services very much. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ly_oci9cDfY%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700021,15700186,15700191,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhgqtQr9bgmUnZwqtkXgsmI-rsXj3A" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

      Under the cut, everything is in the tradition of the <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/search/%3Fq%3D%2523isvcloudstory%26target_type%3Dposts%26order_by%3Drelevance">#isvcloudstory</a> tag - about the company, about life, and about the solution architecture in the cloud.  Be sure to read to the end - the company Tion has prepared a small gift specifically for our readers. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Hello! <br><br>  We launched online sales of breathers in November 2014.  Since then, the figures have increased 20 times: in the first month it was 500,000 rubles, and now it is 10 million. <br><br>  We do not have products that are simply "better" than those already on the market.  We want to create new devices, new markets.  And, of course, we are looking at the story of the same Apple, as they anticipated future needs and products that would cause irreparable benefits to people.  About how this happens, the experience of real users and much more, read our blog on Habrahabr - for example, <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/tion/blog/264912/">here</a> <br><br>  <b>About company</b> <br><br>  We have different legal entities and different projects.  This is all business units.  For example, there is a ‚Äúbig iron‚Äù (B2B market) and there is a ‚Äúsmall‚Äù (B2C).  Their profitability must be considered separately, otherwise one cannot understand what works and what does not.  There are projects that carry out third-party orders - not only for us.  There are non-profit areas.  Tion is a management company and an umbrella brand on which all its subsidiaries are closed.  So, in our opinion, more correctly.  Autonomous business units are always more efficiently vertical. <br><br>  A couple of numbers about what we have now: <br><ul><li>  62 tenders won </li><li>  50 million rubles  total orders </li><li>  25,000 breathers sold </li><li>  300 dealers in 100 cities </li><li>  10 000 000 000 rub.  capitalization (according to the company) </li></ul><br>  <b>About plans and future</b> <br><br>  We plan to deploy low-cost environmental monitoring micro stations in Moscow and Novosibirsk to make air pollution maps.  The idea is this: a person with an application on a smartphone learns about the level of air pollution in the place where he is now.  The service will be free. <br><br>  The point is to give a person objective data, describe what the problem is, and give ready-made solutions.  Something like this: you live at a certain address, you have such and such air outside the window, so you need such a set of filters.  This is our theme; customization is a person as a market segment.  Learn to offer what a particular customer needs with digital technology. <br><br>  We understand what is happening with the air, and we are following the WHO statistics, which states that due to high-quality air, the period of active life can be extended by more than 5 years.  Why not listen to the opinion of environmentalists and physicians?  We simply give accurate figures on the state of the air and tell you what can be done to improve your health and well-being. <br><br>  <i>‚ÄúWe have studied all the systems of‚Äú smart home ‚Äù.</i>  <i>In a detailed investigation, it turned out that none of the existing integrated systems of the ‚Äúsmart home‚Äù is an industry standard.</i>  <i>Neither KNX, nor Inowion, nor Apple HomeKit - none of this can be considered a flagship.</i>  <i>The market needs something like a USB standard - everyone likes it.</i>  <i>Came and connected.</i>  <i>Now the situation in the market of ‚Äúsmart home‚Äù systems resembles the situation with charging for telephones ten years ago - each manufacturer has its own connector.</i>  <i>Therefore, we are waiting for a powerful, well-developed integrated platform of the ‚Äúsmart home‚Äù to emerge, which will be so reliable and convenient that it will immediately attract everyone.</i>  <i>At the same time, such a system will become a universal integrator, and we will be professionals in the microclimate segment, where we will have algorithms that have been tested for several years in real conditions, convenient and understandable interfaces, a whole line of executive devices.</i>  <i>In this scenario, we will become the top solution in the field of microclimate of smart homes, which will be built into a large universal system. ‚Äù</i> ¬© Mikhail Amelkin <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/40a/891/d5f/40a891d5fe5845458f84ad7d9adad192.jpg"><br><br>  There are many ways of development, but one day it became clear: you need some kind of mega-goal, then on the way to it you can achieve a lot.  I would like to learn how to create any microclimate within a single apartment: a pine forest, a sea breeze ... Everything you want is at the touch of a button on the smartphone screen.  But first you have to figure it out a lot, because no one knows to the end how to recreate the air as close as possible to these conditions with available means.  And this is interesting - after all, there are again tasks to be solved for which no one knows the answer. <br><br>  <b>About the team</b> <br><br>  It's easy to make a small business when you have a phone book.  It‚Äôs easy to maintain big business when you have several thousand employees and a long bench.  It is difficult to grow highly qualified personnel in the period of growth.  People are constantly lacking, and in order to find a golden grain of sand, companies need to wash a mountain of sand. <br><br>  We do not have a vertical pyramid: areas of responsibility are somehow divided.  The company has 230 employees.  There is a production, there is a development, there are sales with marketing.  And we are only now calming down this Brownian movement, we are introducing some kind of debugged mechanisms. <br><br>  <b>Technical part</b> <br><br>  By the level of carbon dioxide, we can determine how many people are in the room and their activity.  That is, CO2 data contains much more valuable information than just stuffy / fresh.  For example, while on vacation, I can see from a mobile application that people have entered the apartment.  At a minimum, this is a reason to figure out whether relatives came to water the flowers or the attackers entered.  To measure the instrument are optical CO2 sensors.  So far they are not ‚ÄúThionian‚Äù, but we are already working on our own. <br><br>  <i>‚ÄúThe physics here are simple and famous.</i>  <i>The sensor has a light source, it shines at a certain wavelength.</i>  <i>Carbon dioxide absorbs this light.</i>  <i>There is also a receiver, which fixes everything.</i>  <i>Accordingly, the more carbon dioxide, the less light.</i>  <i>This signal is what determines everything. ‚Äù</i>  (c) Mikhail Amelkin <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/69f/d8d/190/69fd8d190d104211a26c916b375dc253.jpg"><br><br>  The installation process of the smart microclimate system is as follows: <br><br>  1. Install compact ventilation: Tion O2 MAC breather (other models can also be used, but for this you need to replace the ‚Äúbrains‚Äù - this can be done by our customer service).  Installation of the breather takes about an hour, for ready repair, without dirt and complicated work.  The device forcibly supplies fresh air from the street, cleans and warms up - it will be possible not to open the windows, and also to forget about noise, dust and drafts in the apartment. <br><br>  2. Install the MagicAir base station in a convenient place and connect it to any USB port or 220V network.  We set up radio communication with the breather and set up Internet access via Wi-Fi.  Sensors inside the base station will measure air quality and send data to the cloud server.  The history of data is saved and the user can see the dynamics of humidity, CO2, temperature in the context of the rooms for the period on the smartphone screen.  And this is not just a statistic with a beautiful schedule - based on the dynamics of indicators, you can rebuild the air conditioning system in the apartment and optimize the costs of maintenance of equipment and electricity. <br><br>  3. We indicate in the mobile application (at the moment the application MagicAir is available in the AppStore and Google Play) the standard level of CO2 in the room.  If this level is exceeded (for example, when people appear in the room), the base station will choose the optimal breather mode, and when the CO2 level decreases, the system will automatically reduce the ventilation power or turn off the breather altogether.  This, by the way, is also energy efficient. <br><br>  <i>‚ÄúNow the base station controls only the breather, but by the end of the year we plan to expand the system so that we can connect devices from other manufacturers.</i>  <i>To do this, we will release a separate gadget - which will communicate with the base station over the air and simulate the signals of an infrared remote control in order to control the climate technology.</i>  <i>First of all, there will be air conditioners; it is also planned to add a valve to the system for radiators, exhaust fans, cleaners, etc. ‚Äù</i>  (c) Mikhail Amelkin <br><br>  <b>MagicAir system architecture</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/620/b0d/7d8/620b0d7d8645429a9bf0d86e3a5f9265.jpg"><br><br>  In the same room is the base station.  It is tied to the user's personal profile on the cloud server.  The base station processor decides what to do with the breather, air conditioning, and other actuators.  Commands are determined based on user settings. <br><br>  In the remaining rooms are located peripheral sensors.  They communicate with the base station over the RF channel.  The connection of the base station with Tion actuators is also over the RF channel through the built-in radio module.  Communication with devices from third-party manufacturers - through the IR module, which can be purchased separately.  The IR module itself is also a peripheral device that communicates with the base station through the same RF module.  Communication backend and base station via Wi-Fi, communication backend and frontend through any communication channel through which the smartphone goes to the Internet: Wi-Fi, 3G, etc ... <br><br>  A personal user profile is stored on the cloud server, all microclimate parameters, information about the system architecture and the state of all executive devices are collected.  Here big data is analyzed, correlations are tracked for learning computational algorithms. <br><br>  Control of actuators from a smartphone is carried out indirectly through the backend throughout the chain: front - internet - back - internet - Wi-Fi - RF. <br><br>  This is how Tion's MagicAir system looks like.  Use on health! <br><br>  PS The company decided to thank our readers.  But according to the unspoken rules, in order to find out what it is, you need to write a personal message to the <a href="https://geektimes.ru/users/TIONofficial/">representative of the company</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/305976/">https://habr.com/ru/post/305976/</a></p>
