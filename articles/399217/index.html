We will say in advance that according to the results, more than 85% of Tesla Motors shareholders voted positively, so the question can be considered closed.  Documents to the SEC will be submitted shortly. <br><br>  Ilon Mask, the executive director and the main shareholder of both companies, spoke at the meeting.  Ilon made a remarkable statement: according to his calculations, innovative technology - SolarCity solar roofs that generate electricity for the house and car - will be cheaper than conventional roofs already at the installation stage, that is, without taking into account power generation! <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Stepping onto the stage in front of the shareholders, Ilon Mask said: he had just returned from a meeting with the engineers of SolarCity, so now he can state this fact with confidence.  Solar roofs will indeed be cheaper than usual, even without taking into account power generation.

      This is amazing and good news.  Moreover, this is an amazingly bold statement.  After all, if it turns out to be true, then an ordinary person will have no reason why to install an ordinary roof, if a wonderful solar roof is offered for the same money or even cheaper, and it also generates energy.  No wonder, after the start of sales of solar roofs next year, Tesla's Buffalo plant will not cope with the fulfillment of all orders. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ddf/41b/580/ddf41b58013c42639a0e3bdefd90bc18.jpg"><br>  <i>Electric generating roof of slate glass: one of four types of glass developed by Tesla engineers</i> <br><br>  During the official announcement of the solar roofs on October 28, they said something else.  SolarCity promised that solar roofs would be cheaper than usual <i>, taking into account the cost of the generated electricity</i> .  That is, the person was offered to make a profitable investment.  Buy a more expensive roof, which will gradually begin to pay for itself, although it will never fully pay for it, but in the end it will be cheaper than usual. <br><br>  Now it is declared completely different.  In such conditions, people really <b>have no reason to refuse to install solar panels</b> . <br><br>  ‚ÄúIt looks promising that a solar roof will actually cost less than a normal roof without electricity,‚Äù said Ilon Mask.  ‚ÄúSo the main question is:‚Äú Do you want a roof that looks better than a normal roof, it serves twice as long, costs less and, by the way, generates electricity? ‚ÄùFor what reason to buy something else?‚Äù  Indeed, this is a rhetorical question. <br><br>  Ilon Mask said that the roofs of the new generation will be cheaper, taking into account the cost of the installation and <b>without government subsidies</b> .  This is an important note in view of the imminent entry into office of the new US president, who seems to be about to abolish these subsidies and support the oil sector of the US economy. <br><br>  <a href="https://geektimes.ru/post/282000/">The presentation of</a> four types of solar plates for roofs took place on October 28, 2016.  Glass for them developed by the new scientific and technical division of Tesla. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/39d/116/ee7/39d116ee783c43679aae890af785b37b.jpg"><br>  <i>Four types of solar plates for Tesla roofs</i> <br><br>  Now Ilon Mask added that the developed glass is ‚Äúthree, four, sometimes five times‚Äù lighter than existing solutions of concrete and ceramics.  The entrepreneur has calculated that the company will be able to save considerably if you get rid of the extra costs associated with heavy weight and the fragility of ordinary tiles, on logistics and reducing combat during transportation. <br><br>  He added that an important item in savings is the cleanup of the supply chain.  We are talking about reducing the number of intermediaries who cheat price.  Here, a single company is engaged in the production, delivery and installation. <br><br>  Production of roofs will be developed jointly with Panasonic at a new plant in Buffalo (New York).  Tesla promises to start production of new glass next year. <br><br>  The total cost of each roof will be calculated individually.  It depends on the roof area and installation cost.  Perhaps the cost of the house itself. <br><br>  Of course, the price of the roof does not include the Powerwall 2 battery for home storage of electricity.  A 14 kWh battery with an integrated inverter will be sold separately for $ 5,500. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/e9d/6c8/94e/e9d6c894e4e8772bef4de4ae0c1bbed5.jpg"><br>  <i>The Powerwall 2 battery, 1150 √ó 755 √ó 155 mm in size and weighing 122 kg, is suitable for indoor or outdoor installation on a wall or floor, and works in a temperature range from ‚àí20 ¬∞ C to 50 ¬∞ C.</i>  <i>Warranty 10 years (unlimited charge / discharge cycles), power 5 kW continuously, 7 kW peak</i> <br><br>  If the company keeps its promise, then the new technology will become a truly revolutionary product that is able to transform the market.  At the moment, new roofs are installed on 5 million American homes annually.  This includes new buildings and old houses that need to be updated roofing. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/685/6d0/b73/6856d0b73ca84eb3b3de54af733c750e.jpg"><br>  <i>Tesla solar roof made of smooth glass</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/8aa/f02/5b0/8aaf025b0e5643a0b6e9105d8aa2ac31.jpg"><br>  <i>Tesla Tuscan Glass Solar Roof</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/255/247/7e8/2552477e8fdd4e66a83d172fbe58d0a4.jpg"><br>  <i>Tesla Solar Textured Glass Roof</i> <br><br>  Recall that Ilon Mask <a href="https://geektimes.ru/post/277598/">proposed to unite</a> Tesla Motors and SolarCity in June 2016.  Energy company SolarCity is engaged in the design, financing and installation of solar energy systems.  The company employs more than 13,000 people.  The company was founded in 2006 by brothers Peter and Lyndon Riva, who implemented the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãtheir cousin Ilona Mask.  Ilon himself became the head of the company and helped with the launch of the project. <br><br>  For ten years, SolarCity has maintained leadership in the installation of solar panels in California, ranking second in the number of installations in the United States. <br><br>  Since 2013, Tesla Motors shares have grown by more than 500%, although the company has not yet begun to make a profit.  At the same time, SolarCity's net loss doubled in 2015 to $ 769 million. Ilon Musk financed his companies when they needed money, bought their shares and opened personal credit lines against the security of their remaining shares.  Possible financial destabilization in such a situation is threatened by a margin call, that is, a forced closing of a position.  If the shares of SolarCity continued to decline, then open credit lines would require additional financing.  Exchange for Tesla Motors shares solves the problem with the decline in SolarCity shares. <br><br>  The <a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/329671870/Tesla-and-SolarCity">document for shareholders Tesla Motors</a> said that the exchange for the shares of SolarCity will add more than $ 500 million to the balance of Tesla Motors. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/https://translate" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/399217/">https://habr.com/ru/post/399217/</a></p>
