The number of companies interested in internet marketing is increasing every year.  Trust in the customer is caused not so much by the top positions in the search results, as by the popularity of the company in the market, its good reputation, name and recommendations. <br>  The online edition of SEOnews has set a goal, by polling the professional community, to determine the level of fame of the SEO companies of the Runet. <br><br>  50 companies and 10 experts took part in the voting.  At first, the market players themselves named and rated the 10 most famous, in their opinion, SEO companies, excluding themselves.  As a result of the first stage of voting, 70 companies of the market were named as companies.  After analyzing the data of competing companies, according to the results of the first part of the voting, AdLabs took the 11th place in the rating. <br>  Then a list of 20 leading companies was sent to the experts, who adjusted it by putting their estimates.  Among the authoritative professionals were well-versed in the situation on the SEO market, Vladislav Kochetkov (FINAM), Inga Skvortsova (Cliff), Nikita Melkin (Semonitor), Evgeny Poshibalov (Sape), Sergey Tsyplakov (Mainlink), Viktor Lavrenko (Nigma), Pavel Rogozhin (Rambler), Sergey Kotyrev (Yumisoft), Dmitry Golopolosov (author of the blog.dimok.ru blog), German Klimenko (Liveinternet.ru). <br>  During the second stage, according to the results of expert evaluation <b>, AdLabs took the 3rd place</b> after the companies Ashmanov and Partners and RBS Corporation, which is a very flattering result, since expert opinion is usually more objective than that of competing companies. <br>  So, according to the results of all the research, AdLabs has become one of the leaders of the final brand rating of SEO companies of the Runet.  Having taken the 6th position out of 20, AdLabs received a beautiful gold medal as a reward. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a73/5ed/568/a735ed568e8e29abf0dbf4b250c60e29.gif" alt="image">

      It is worth noting that of all the companies included in the rating, only two of them - AdLabs and Optimizm - according to the results of expert evaluation, significantly increased their positions regarding the first stage of voting.  At this stage, AdLabs overtook such companies as Biplane, UnMedia, Cocos, Demis and VIPRO, leaving behind only the top five - Ashmanov and Partners, RBS Corporation, Ingate, Matik and Texart. <br>  Not a bad result, but there is something to strive for! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/82999/">https://habr.com/ru/post/82999/</a></p>
