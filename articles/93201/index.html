Let's take a look at them from the customer.  So, rake and attempts to circumvent them.  Scenario "customer refers to an unfamiliar freelancer." <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b>Disruption</b> <br><br>  They promise to do to the 10th number and do not.  Then the term is transferred again.  And a few more times.  In the end, the work will be done, but the pleasure of communicating with a freelancer disappears.  What to do?  Tried checkpoints - does not help.  Until the deadline came up, everything goes according to plan.  At the time of delivery happens force majeure.  Somehow: the OS crashed, the hard drive broke, I urgently had to go to another city, got sick, turned off the lights.  Of course, anything can happen.  But in the end, the term is broken.  For myself, I found only one way out - from the very beginning to plan that the time limit would be broken twice or even three times. <br><br>  <b>No connection</b>

      The customer wants to get at least some feedback.  Well, write a few lines about what has been done in the last couple of days.  Let the customer be aware.  Otherwise, after 4-5 days of silence, bad thoughts arise.  Any customer, most likely, already had a negative experience with fraudsters who took the prepayment and dissolved in the fog.  So keep in touch. <br><br>  For my part, always ask to " <i>keep up to date</i> ."  If the performer is silent, I begin to act in the style of a woodpecker and I catch the phrases " <i>how is it going?</i> " <br><br>  <b>Literacy issues</b> <br><br>  Dear freelancers, pay attention to the Russian language.  It helps to make an impression about you, both positive and not so.  Phrases such as " <i>taking into account the wishes of the customer</i> " or placing the button " <i>Register</i> " - all this immediately reflects on the desire to work with you.  Also, do not fall into familiarity.  Here is an excerpt from a real resume to the position of a programmer: "I <i>earn money by supervising remote teams and programming all sorts of nonsense</i> ."  Not a single customer thinks of his project as a " <i>nonsense</i> " that needs to be programmed. <br><br>  I noticed that problems with the Russian language are more common among freelancers from Ukraine, Moldova and Belarus.  One of them said so directly to me - " <i>sorry, of course, but Russian is not my native language</i> ."  In some ways he is right.  I would like to speak in Japanese as he is in Russian (I myself live in Japan).  However, if earlier I did not pay any attention to which country the freelancer is from, then now I‚Äôll pay. <br><br>  <b>Reviews are lying</b> <br><br>  As Dr. House says, everyone lies.  Reviews are no exception.  They need to believe carefully.  For a long time, I have been wary of a large number of positive reviews.  Behind these reviews may be an extortioner of positive reviews. <br><br>  Or it may be the manager.  And here we have all the charm of working through a manager - information reaches the executor and back with a delay, plus the effect of a broken phone.  I do not want to cast a shadow on all managers, but I have only negative experience with them.  I prefer to work directly with performers, without intermediaries. <br><br>  The rake theme can be developed further. <br><br>  In the meantime, I will tell you about the perfect freelancer.  He immediately clarified all the details.  He was very correct and polite in communication.  He divided the task into stages and made a work plan for the week ahead.  Clearly adhered to the plan and wrote about the results every 2 days.  At the end, I provided the working code and, which came as a surprise, a separate documentation file.  The program was tested, fully complied with the TK and the code itself was well commented. <br><br>  It seems to be nothing supernatural, but very rarely it is all possible to get it all in one bottle - competent, in touch, meets deadlines.  More such exemplary freelancers I have not yet met.  By the way, her name was Diana. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/93201/">https://habr.com/ru/post/93201/</a></p>
