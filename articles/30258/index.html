This method did not seem to be the most convenient, because when reading it you completely give yourself to this activity, and when listening there are a lot of distractions.  However, the first experience of using an audiobook proved its worth.  After all, I often want to hear news from constantly visited sites, but there is not enough time for it.  However, from the time spent on the road, sports, and just inaction, you can gain additional benefits.  I remembered the experience of listening to several articles on the Internet.  Then there was no time to read the article, but there was an opportunity to listen.  The idea of ‚Äã‚Äãcreating audio versions of text materials is not new: it has existed on the web for a long time, but it hasn‚Äôt gained much acceptance.  At that time, the search for such Internet services produced an empty result.  Demanded niche was empty.  Soon I decided to create such a service. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><br>  Prior to the active implementation of the project, I worked as a software developer, but I have long wanted to change my occupation.  First, the project was given a little time, then almost all the free time.  So the work went. 
      <br>

        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"

      One of the first tasks was to find a name for the project.  Initially, there was confidence in the name ‚ÄúMediaVolos‚Äù, but then, through a play on words, the ‚ÄúWebdiktor‚Äù was born. <br><br>  The concept of the logo came to mind immediately and was soon brought to life by a freelancer.  To create a project, we needed: a project manager, site developer, speaker manager, site editor.  Small tasks were entrusted to either the same freelancers, or were solved on their own. <br><br>  Money was allocated from its own funds, investors were not attracted.  In terms of about three months it turned out (not counting one forced monthly leave of the leading people of the project just before its opening). <br><br>  Speakers.  First, we looked for speakers among friends, but then had to post ads on the Internet.  At the time of this writing, 4 announcers regularly work, however, about 20 people have already been tried.  Someone was not satisfied with the conditions, someone just could not read well.  We provided all candidates for announcers with microphones, detailed instructions for recording and full support for ICQ.  The terms of cooperation before the opening of the site were simple: payment for the announced amount of text. <br><br><br><br>  Currently, the site provides basic functionality.  Now a lot of efforts are being made to expand it. <br><br>  We are open for cooperation with authors and copyright holders of interesting materials, we are looking for new announcers. <br><br>  We are planning to expand the subject, there would be a need for the audience. <br><br>  We do not intend to demand money from listeners.  However, if the work of our announcers is to your liking and to be useful, you will be able to thank them on their personal pages.  We hope that our experimental approach to getting a reward for speakers will bear fruit. <br><br>  We are waiting for comments and suggestions - the service is made mainly for you. <br> <a href="" title="webdiktor.ru-080729-129.mp3"><br></a>  <a href="" title="webdiktor.ru-080729-129.mp3">Audio version of the article</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/30258/">https://habr.com/ru/post/30258/</a></p>
