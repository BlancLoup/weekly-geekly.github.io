In this post I will try to describe my impressions of the next ultrabook that got me to review.  At this time, I got one of the most interesting representatives of the new line of ultrabooks on the Core i5 processor of the third generation, Acer Aspire S7.  Communication with the device took quite a long time and as a result I had accumulated a sufficient amount of material, which it was time to share. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/ff2/2f4/71e/ff22f471ef3bc29fb678c2e770aa425c.jpg"><br><br><a name="habracut"></a>

      <br>
      But, in order.  Acer Aspire S7-391 comes in a discreet cardboard box, inside which is another box, already beautiful and shiny.  Everything is as it should be. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/b19/7b5/7fe/b197b57fec934fbb1f16f3b7e61668fa.jpg"><br><br>  Inside the package is divided into several sections, in which the accessories and the ultrabook are packed. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/611/9be/db0/6119bedb0b1a02bc6ec31ce16d5afe28.jpg"><br><br>  As for accessories, the manufacturer did not stint here and invested everything necessary.  Acer Aspire S7 is equipped with a convenient carrying case for carrying, a pair of adapters (USB - Lan and microHDMI - D-Sub), and a wireless mouse. <br>  The cover is frankly good, it will reliably protect the ultrabook case from scratches and allow you to charge it in a packed <br>  condition. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/588/0f0/211/5880f0211f62cb63831b20b0cb54ce1b.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/dd8/fb6/e86/dd8fb6e86d718a0a01a9abd5d6f09920.jpg"><br><br>  With the mouse, everything is a little worse, it does not make a positive impression due to a loud click and an awkward grip for me.  Behind the wheel there is a two-color on-off indicator and connection indicator.  The rest is the usual BT mouse. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/ea6/f8a/085/ea6f8a085800a0e4114b3e7e8c3da00c.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/1d7/68d/f7f/1d768df7fddd90cc20c71bdebb9509c7.jpg"><br><br>  The power supply for the Aspire S7 is the same story.  No, there are no complaints to the block itself, the dimensions are quite acceptable, it is also heated moderately when working.  It becomes sad from the network cable, its size and weight, compared with the charging case, is very frustrating.  This is an ultrabook with very moderate consumption, and not a heater or a kettle. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/369/f1b/5ec/369f1b5ec179d8fd95cef0c640cdab17.jpg"><br><br>  Technical characteristics of Acer Aspire S7: <br><br><table><tbody><tr><td>  CPU </td><td>  Intel Core i5 3317U (1.7 GHz), 2 cores, L3 3 MB cache, NT, TDP 17 W </td></tr><tr><td>  Chipset </td><td>  Intel HM77 Express, TDP 4.1 W </td></tr><tr><td>  RAM </td><td>  4 GB DDR3 at 1333 MHz (2 GB x 2), without the possibility of expansion. </td></tr><tr><td>  Video card </td><td>  Intel HD Graphics 4000 </td></tr><tr><td>  Network devices </td><td>  Acer Nplify 802.11 a / g / n (Atheros AR5BMD222) <br>  Bluetooth 4.0 </td></tr><tr><td>  Storage System </td><td>  SSD: 128Gb 2xLite-On CMT-64L3M (Raid 0) </td></tr><tr><td>  Integrated devices </td><td>  Acer Crystal Eye HD, microphone, SD / MMC card reader, light sensor </td></tr><tr><td>  Ports for connecting devices </td><td>  Two USB 3.0 ports, one microHDMI port, one audio jack (headphone and microphone), one Gigabit Ethernet port (via adapter)) </td></tr><tr><td>  Display </td><td>  13.3 "Multi-touch (1920x1080) Acer Cine Crystal LCD (10 touch points) </td></tr><tr><td>  Battery </td><td>  4-section (2340 mAh) </td></tr><tr><td>  Dimensions </td><td>  323.3 x 223.5 x 11.9 mm </td></tr><tr><td>  Weight </td><td>  1.3 kg </td></tr><tr><td>  operating system </td><td>  Windows 8 64bit </td></tr></tbody></table><br><br>  Immediately after unpacking, the Acer Aspire S7 made a good impression on me, both with the materials used in the case and with the overall build quality.  It is very pleasant to hold this light ultrabook in hand, but the feeling of fragility of the structure does not arise.  On the contrary, the Acer Aspire S7 seems durable enough to survive the intense exploitation and frequent relocations in the bag.  The cover of the ultrabook on both sides is covered with a protective glass Gorilla Glass 2, which allows you not to worry about accidental scratches or damage. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/bd6/64e/58c/bd664e58c86c9e87787edf94bd99c0fa.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/ab2/16e/715/ab216e715a2c670ad90c855262417dbe.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/83a/aa4/19e/83aaa419e5861dd4e2a485cb57669501.jpg"><br><br>  When you open the lid, emotions are still added.  Wow  Aluminum keyboard, cool!  Alas, it is not, the buttons, of course, plastic.  The keyboard is made on the island type, and, despite its beauty, is one of the weak points of the ultrabook.  There are only two reasons for this - an inconvenient layout and a microscopic keystroke.  Typing is inconvenient, especially if you used an average computer keyboard before.  The keyboard has a two-level backlight, the buttons glow evenly, the backlight does not cause any complaints. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/351/999/2a3/3519992a335c091b78fe958ad605cd89.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/907/97e/4bd/90797e4bdd32ee81e6f2e9396e63cd3c.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/65c/142/e76/65c142e765d1d1dc87a9faf0105c047e.jpg"><br><br>  But if the keyboard is somewhat pumped up - everything is in order with the touchpad.  In my opinion, the Acer Aspire S7 has one of the most convenient touchpad, both in terms of positioning accuracy and tactile sensations.  Its size is small, but quite sufficient for comfortable work. <br><br>  Above the keyboard are two indicators, charge and start.  In my opinion, the brightness of the LEDs is optimal, they are always visible, but they do not cause irritation. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/098/d86/a5b/098d86a5b8d7a41f388f1936e0376408.jpg"><br><br>  All connectors are located on the side faces of the case.  On the right is a pair of USB 3.0 ports and a card reader connector.  Their layout is not the most successful, the connection of some devices can be difficult due to the proximity of the connectors to each other.  The card reader is provided with a small cap, SD cards are inserted about half of its size. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/3d2/9df/1b4/3d29df1b4147adb74fbd967e826acc3d.jpg"><br><br>  On the left side there is a charging connector, a microHDMI, a headphone connector and an ultrabook on button.  Pretty modest, but everything you need is there. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/f43/061/656/f430616564ff87cfe1568cf73a48cfaa.jpg"><br><br>  The bottom of the Acer Aspire S7 plastic.  It contains a pair of speakers and air intake grille.  If you look closely, you can find a button to disconnect the battery, which will allow you to reset the ultrabook if it hangs tight.  When you click on it, the Acer Aspire S7 turns off not immediately, but after a couple of seconds.  The hole in the microphone was placed on the end of the bottom, which seemed to me a very controversial decision.  If the Acer Aspire S7 is lying on its knees or a soft surface - the hole is easy to block, and the clicks from the keyboard will not bring joy to anyone.  The assumption is fully confirmed.  In general, either we communicate by voice, or we type the text and use the touchpad.  Clicks are heard more than clearly and loudly, while the voice is muffled. <br>  A pair of speakers provides good (adjusted for size) sound quality, the volume is enough.  The bottom position imposes on them exactly the same limitations as on the microphone. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/4f5/6c0/f00/4f56c0f00db20a91c6de3d6a7dde0d40.jpg"><br><br>  Screen Acer Aspire S7 has excellent characteristics.  Sufficient screen brightness, good contrast, excellent viewing angles, FullHD resolution, excellent sensor sensitivity - a full set of buns.  However, not everything is so smooth.  The protective glass glares very much; when working, you can see not only yourself in the reflection, but everything behind it, and the location of the light source influences the situation a little.  Fingerprints also remain on the screen without much effort, with intensive use of the sensor, cleaning the screen from fingerprints becomes one of the regular activities.  On the upper edge of the screen frame is a web-camera with HD resolution and a light sensor.  The lid opens at an angle of just over 180 '. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/89a/6cd/826/89a6cd8267df1fced2e13e98ff5f3e8b.jpg"><br><br>  On this external inspection of the Acer Aspire S7 is completed, go to the tests. <br><br>  <b>To begin with, a system assessment:</b> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/e6f/b64/24b/e6fb6424bb398dd6b243025c4176a19e.png"><br><br>  Not a bad result, especially for a hard disk, but let's not forget that the ‚ÄúEight‚Äù raises the maximum bar to 9.9 points. <br><br>  <b>Aida 64:</b> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/8a6/ca8/90e/8a6ca890e349da553135297e3a345e6f.png"><br><br>  Indicators are quite standard for this processor and dual-channel memory. <br><br>  <b>WinRar 4.20 64bit:</b> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/741/892/c53/741892c53ebb0e0c7dfe8ff0a4c4cae2.png"><br><br>  The speed is quite sufficient, but certainly not comparable with modern high performance desktops. <br><br>  <b>3DMark:</b> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/89d/a69/cc7/89da69cc7dade3061c867380ed661e32.jpg"><br><br>  <b>3DMark 2011:</b> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/2d7/829/e3c/2d7829e3cdfb60ddca896534478617b8.png"><br><br>  Standard for the HD4000 results, nothing unusual. <br><br>  <b>Crystal Disk Info:</b> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/1a4/76b/787/1a476b7879b1d9857504214560f6c103.png"><br><br>  Here everything is a little more interesting - the drive is organized from two halves of 64GB each, assembled in Raid 0. <br>  The performance tests of the <b>Crystal Disk Mark</b> only confirm this: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/dc3/4bb/29c/dc34bb29c6ef722801a562b86f038fee.png"><br><br>  Acer Aspire S7 has an excellent drive performance. <br><br>  <b>PCMark 7:</b> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/3e4/53a/e98/3e453ae980e7ef89105a6bd018b5cadb.png"><br><br>  Very good result, largely due to the fast SSD. <br><br>  A few words about the cooling system.  In my opinion, Acer engineers managed to make a fairly effective and successful CO.  At the far end of the ultrabook are two rows of openings divided among themselves, for taking cold air and for emitting hot air.  This scheme allows to operate the ultrabuk on almost any surface that does not block access to the air intakes.  Fan noise can be called tolerable, given the dimensions of the hull, in any case a small turbine will be installed there, which will either annoy the owner with a wild howl under load or not.  In this case, everything turned out to be quite good, the noise in the absence of an intense load on the CPU remains at a quite comfortable level.  The cooling efficiency is also in order, under load (3DMark 2011, Performance preset), the processor did not heat up above 78 'C. What I would like to especially note - the frequency reset due to overheating also did not occur, under multi-load Core i5 3317U honestly worked at 2.4 GHz , as during the work from a network, and from the accumulator.  In this case, the ultrabook body heats up very moderately, which is another plus. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/e6b/c73/3ff/e6bc733ff69ddd3b316ee03028532f97.jpg"><br><br>  <b>Sensor readings:</b> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/b50/8e7/071/b508e7071f5016a4ae12eccece0eeac3.png"><br><br>  To sum up - with the performance of the Acer Aspire S7 everything is in order, the only bottleneck may be the amount of RAM, 8GB on board would be preferable.  Also an unpleasant moment in the course of testing was the inadequate behavior of the complete mouse.  With a high load on the CPU - the cursor periodically freezes or moves in jerks. <br><br>  Copying files via Wi-Fi: in conjunction with the Tp-Link WR1043ND router, the speed of copying files from the network storage was approximately <b>10.5MB / s</b> . <br><br>  Ultrabook was not surprised by the battery life.  At full load (3DMark 2011), the Acer Aspire S7 processor and graphics core lasted <b>1 hour and 25 minutes</b> .  Brightness at maximum, Wi-Fi enabled.  In the mode of low load (surfing the net, a set of documents) and the average brightness of the display, the operating time is <b>about 4.5-5 hours</b> , not bad, but not a super result. <br><br>  From working with the Acer Aspire S7 are mostly positive impressions.  This ultrabook has a bright and memorable design that will not allow you to pass by without paying attention to it.  It is well-equipped, well-built and does not have any critical flaws.  All flaws in the design and layout can easily be attributed to body thickness and weight.  Performance at a good level, excellent FullHD display, in general, there is almost everything you need to work.  And I would not be surprised if you want to take it in your hands again and again. <br><br>  <b>Pros:</b> <br>  + Thin and light <br>  + Attractive design <br>  + Excellent display and sensitive sensor <br>  + Use of aluminum and safety glass in the design <br>  + Great touchpad <br>  + Fast SSD <br>  + Keyboard backlight <br><br>  <b>Minuses:</b> <br>  - Inconvenient keyboard <br>  - Huge power cord for power supply <br>  - Bad microphone location <br>  - Dazzling coating of protective glass display <br>  - Hanging the mouse cursor complete with high CPU usage </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/168371/">https://habr.com/ru/post/168371/</a></p>
