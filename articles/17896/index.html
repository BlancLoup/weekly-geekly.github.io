They have a lot to learn. <br><br>  <strong>Henry Ford</strong> <br>  Self-taught mechanic.  Since childhood, he wore nuts and bolts in his pockets.  Abandoned farming career.  Not having an engineering education, I collected my first car.  Without management skills, he organized a car manufacturing company.  Set a goal to create the best and at the same time the cheapest, people's car no more than $ 500. <br><br>  Could not tolerate when he was cross stitch.  He was a firm, confident, sometimes aggressive and ruthless, intolerant to opponents, intractable person.  By popularity, this odious personality competed with the presidents of the United States and movie stars of the time.

      Ford considered high earnings of workers and low prices for products as criteria of production efficiency. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  <strong>Stephen Jobs</strong> <br>  The man who glorified Apple Computer.  He did not create microprocessors for personal computers.  He did not participate in system design, but in software (Stephen Wozniak was the author of all the technologies).  Jobs was a catalyst. <br><br>  It was he who gave impetus to the creation of a new market and organized this risky business.  The idea of ‚Äã‚ÄãApple Computer became his passion, his family, work, love, all that was worth living for.  He lived.  At Apple, he embodied his individuality.  A rationalist who possessed a rare far-sightedness and was able to sacrifice everything, he searched for knowledge for the sake of knowledge itself and was open to new opportunities, but at the same time showed intolerance to those who looked at the world differently: "This is my way, and this is the best way." <br><br>  Apple employees called Jobs "His Majesty."  Impulsive and despotic, rebel and nonconformist, he rejected the conventional wisdom, relying on his own intuition, and exuded enormous internal energy.  A perfectionist, an eccentric loner with an autocratic iron will. <br><br>  Even without occupying an official management position at Apple for a long period of time, he took upon himself all of the conceivable power ‚Äî exercising leadership, changing plans, creating new products, dictating policy.  His dictatorial management style spawned many enemies, although it was thanks to him that Stephen achieved success.  Someone after talking to Jobs spoke about his ability to convince: "He can influence reality with an effort of will." <br><br>  <strong>Sergey Korolev</strong> <br>  Chief Designer.  After a personal meeting with Tsiolkovsky in 1929, a student at Moscow Higher Technical School forever carried away with space.  "The whole meaning of my life was one thing - to get through to the stars." <br><br>  In 1938, when he was chief of the sector of cruise missiles of the Rocket Institute, he was repressed and sent to Kolyma.  But since 1946, Korolev again heads the work on ballistic missiles, and in 1956 he becomes the chief designer of rocket and space technology.  Showing organizational skills, the ability to solve specific tasks, develop a strategic line, inspire supporters, visiting the workplace at any time of the day, Korolev works frantically.  At the same time, he strictly demands the same from his subordinates. <br><br>  Defending his position, he is firm and adamant even in a dispute with the ministers and the highest ranks of the Central Committee.  Discussions, disputes, mutually exclusive judgments, ideas, fantastic projects, misunderstanding - all this Korolev bears on his shoulders, bringing together and selecting the best option. <br><br>  Comprehensive knowledge of the subject, inflexible will, assertiveness, fantastic energy, conviction and intuition helped him to achieve the desired results and charge the enthusiasm of thousands of people around him.  Contemporaries knew nothing about the creator of the first rocket-space systems, the man who opened the era of space exploration.  In the USSR, he was classified. <br><br>  Back to topic: <br>  <a href="http://www.steve-pavlina.ru/business/charisma/">What is charisma</a> <br>  <a href="http://www.steve-pavlina.ru/business/10-method-charisma/">10 ways to "pump up" charisma</a> <br><br>  Original: <a href="http://www.steve-pavlina.ru/">Self-development for smart people</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/17896/">https://habr.com/ru/post/17896/</a></p>
