      The product is not user friendly, not at all.  Navigation is very different from the products that people are used to using (VKontakte, facebook, classmates, and many others).  Want to read a private message?  - On!, Get!, Everything is simple: <br><br><ol><li>  Find the activity icon </li><li>  Not found?  It is in the top menu, you need to drive a mouse over it until you see the hint ‚ÄúCommunication‚Äù </li><li>  It turned out ?, on a candy.  Now look in the content area for the Link "Filter" </li><li>  Choose from the drop-down menu "Messages" and you will be happy </li></ol><br><br>  In order to just send a message, just walk to the second step.  And this is easier. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  As you have already noticed, the product is not localized into Russian.  This is of course a minus, but for players in the market for similar platforms of Western development, this is quite a common phenomenon.  The list of minuses if not a localized product is deployed in the company: <br><br><ul><li>  Your colleagues will not be able to quickly figure out how and where to click </li><li>  Your colleagues will not be able to understand how and why to use it (if you are not an Aglitsa company and the people are not advanced or about advanced - please do not develop discussions about what is ‚Äúadvanced‚Äù) </li></ul><br><br>  Users need to tell how groups are created, subscriptions work and much more, because everything works as I have already described ... in complex ways :) <br><br><h4>  Technical support </h4><br><br>  <strong>Important</strong> : Product support is provided at a sooo low level.  All communication takes place within closed communities.  Because of time zones: You write during working hours, and you get the answer only in the morning.  Guarantees that the task will be closed - no.  A small example, you do not have the ability to download database dumps from the control panel?  - then, send a flash drive to the UK (there is a data center there). <br>  <strong>Those caliper</strong> : Ping-Pong and sabotage deadlines are the few that customers get. <br><br>  Lan, and just a little about others: <br><br><h3>  SociaCast - Enterprise collaboration and enterprise social networking </h3><br><br>  The company has gained a huge client base since 2008, the well-known General Motors, NASA and Nokia are working with them.  In 2011, it was bought by VMware, which is also their client. <br><br><h3>  Enterprise open source portal and collaboration software.  - Liferay.com </h3><br><br>  On the official website, I did not find the Vidic presentations, but they have a bunch of pictures on the site.  The product is very flexible, hundreds of settings, almost everything can be done by clicking in the admin panel. For some, this is a huge bonus and for me - a minus <br><br><h3>  Social &amp; Mobile Application Development Platform - Force.com </h3><br><br>  The platform is hanging in the cloud, which they boast.  The product is young, but it is already actively promoting.  Little I know about him is positioned as PaaS. <br><br><hr><br>  <strong>PS</strong> <br>  I will write further on this topic, and in this post I will add a video, but a little later - the dinner is over it's time to work. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/142005/">https://habr.com/ru/post/142005/</a></p>
