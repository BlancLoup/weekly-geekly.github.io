  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Overview of Android applications for creating panoramic images</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Panoramic photos are always breathtaking, as they are able to create a certain presence effect when viewed.  The HTC One family of smartphones has an excellent tool for creating panoramic images.  But what to do if your smartphone is not equipped with such functionality or its implementation does not suit you, it does not matter - you can always use third-party solutions, some of which we will try to consider in this article. <br><br>  Under our close attention came as a paid Pano along with a free utility with a talking title Panorama, and having an introductory and commercial version of Photaf Panorama.  Let us try to find out with concrete examples whether it is worth to shell out for one or another solution. <br><br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  Pano </h2><br>  The review opens the most visually viable program for shooting panoramas.  Minimalism and accuracy of the interface appear here in everything.  But we must admit that the unenviable fate befell the possible settings.  All we can do is disable geotagging for the created snapshots.

You take a normal picture, and after a short pause, only a part of it remains on the screen, with which you need to combine the next photo as precisely as possible.  There are no strict limitations on the number of shots in the series.  As practice has shown, the program sticks together up to eight photos without problems, and the processing time of images increases very slightly. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/1ee/99e/2c5/1ee99e2c5b67f008f213392f8ece9875.png"></div><br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/200/084/065/200084065a350d543b99e50eefbd8cef.png"></div><br><br>  When you want to admire the results of your work, it will be enough to click on the tick button and wait a bit.  The resulting panorama is easily scrolled from left to right, and you can share it with friends on social networks right from the app. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/964/8c4/c45/9648c4c4528fddb7a1a57b50de3bec78.png"></div><br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/10c/96d/d04/10c96dd041cd673f3efa02e8c48f9074.png"></div><br><br>  Several test batches, combined into a single whole, showed a relatively good performance of the gluing algorithms, but it is still too early to draw final conclusions.  It is worth considering the rest of the applicants for the role of the most preferred program for creating panoramic images.  Moreover, Pano is the only program that does not have a free version. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/da4/a9f/d06/da4a9fd066e88cdcfdbeda542ced172b.png"><br><br>  Independently assess the quality of the application, you can on the following images: <br><br>  Examples: <a href="">1</a> , <a href="">2</a> . <br><br>  Buy for $ 2.99: <br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/4de/99d/ffc/4de99dffc16be91b6f5cb2ac9fad0086.gif"></div><br><br><br><br><h2>  Panorama </h2><br>  This program also pleases us with a rather pleasant interface, the elements of which divide the application into two main sections - the actual shooting and the gallery.  Before delving into the details of the shooting process, we advise you to turn to the settings and choose the social network that is most preferable for quick publishing of your shots.  It is only necessary to keep in mind that the ‚Äúone-click‚Äù is real here, and after authorizing the necessary service, any careless pressing can entail replenishing your online archive with images.  In addition, of the popular services, only Twitter and Facebook are presented, and to store images of relatively high resolution, it‚Äôs still better to use specialized photo hosting sites. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/e41/752/c4f/e41752c4fcef701c90b56e1ec6c9a728.png"><br><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/b6d/93b/84f/b6d93b84fd8260928276021ce950f7c8.png"><br><br><br>  In comparison with the ascetic Pano, there is definitely something to make: the presence of several simple filters for image processing and the ability to activate the flash.  In addition, there is a transition to the Gallery, containing already saved images. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/33c/ea9/40e/33cea940e331b4417013702233ed6b78.png"><br><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/c79/8e0/04b/c798e004bba96a67967f70bcc7558195.png"><br><br><br>  Unlike Pano, Panorama does not require pressing the shutter button each time.  It is enough to activate the algorithm once and slowly rotate the phone around an imaginary axis, trying not to shift it in one or another dimension.  In the process of shooting, Panorama will take about ten pictures, which will be automatically merged and presented to your attention. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/4e9/31e/035/4e931e0351dc0bcb2c677d7eaf37c222.png"><br><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/39e/785/770/39e78577016aa5c9fbfb37c1e70a59b6.png"><br><br><br>  Having shot a panorama, you can not only share it, but also, if necessary, delete it or immediately start creating a new one. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/48d/c31/46a/48dc3146a0015dd1c1b95ec428187abb.png"><br><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/7a1/1d7/6b4/7a11d76b4c23fcded2a7b19da63ab181.png"><br><br><br>  Unfortunately, the test images can not express satisfaction with this approach.  There is a significant error in the formed geometry, and most likely, when shooting with hands, you will not be able to achieve more acceptable results.  You can draw conclusions about the quality of the panoramas made by the Panorama program yourself using the examples below. <br><br>  Examples: <a href="">1</a> , <a href="">2</a> . <br><br>  Free install Panorama: <br> <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details%3Fid%3Dpanorama.activity"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/df9/44c/811/df944c8112e061eccc22776bb645f899.gif"></a> <br><br><h2>  Photaf Panorama </h2><br>  Behind a beautiful screen saver lies a completely unimaginable interface.  Honestly, such a jumble of buttons is somewhat discouraging.  In principle, it is easy to master the program and its current presentation, but whether it will be pleasant to use it is a big question. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/ec0/45e/cb3/ec045ecb3952a802a51b4e6d30388046.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/3b3/978/fd1/3b3978fd1fa264ae30e5e33826f34373.png"><br><br>  Unfortunately, the program does not respond to a change in the position of the apparatus in space, so using the numerous settings is not very convenient.  However, it is still worth focusing on individual points.  The most important option is to force activation of the manual mode, which makes an analogue of Pano from the program.  By default, Photaf generates a panoramic image automatically, and indicators of vertical and horizontal levels are designed to deal with deviations. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/3e2/832/bd5/3e2832bd579477889d9db2e36ebc7b2a.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/5f8/569/1c1/5f85691c14a221e2239ca3b2bda36c2e.png"><br><br>  The program can notify about the capture of an image with both a vibration and a sound signal.  Autofocus is on by default, and immediately before shooting, the white balance or exposure level is adjusted, and the flash is activated if necessary. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/8b3/752/161/8b37521617e0532643560b994a79da0f.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/f59/21b/7c9/f5921b7c9fe45ff917e332a47a99824e.png"><br><br>  Pressing the on-screen button activates shooting, and you can join pictures at any time with the appropriate key.  In the process of merging, a program icon is displayed in the notification area, and the procedure itself takes a little longer than other programs from this sample. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/45d/593/822/45d5938221862d4ca46ac3f1fa3a4b96.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/aaf/169/fbe/aaf169fbe1f5e45d588e048df455f3bc.png"><br><br>  In preview mode, the image appears in a pseudo-three-dimensional form and easily scrolls through gestures on the screen.  The picture quality can be slightly improved by clicking on the corresponding item on the context menu. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/491/1f9/0fe/4911f90fe9b3f19c1cc1e6a71a35b832.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/1d1/1f9/bf0/1d11f9bf000cf378cc2a80dcaa189cb5.png"><br><br>  Finally, the application has an online gallery with a selection of panoramas made by other users, and if you wish, you can easily add the results of your work to them.  Comparing Photaf Panorama with other participants of the review, it is impossible not to note the richness of the settings and the presence of auxiliary indicators when shooting.  But to achieve any satisfactory picture quality is possible only with the purchase of the full version. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/00d/bd9/628/00dbd9628fe1178b39b9b46d3d8a9333.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/83c/15f/324/83c15f3241f439e31ffaf44c3b3ba129.png"><br><br>  You can see the panoramas taken with Photaf Panorama using the examples below. <br><br>  Examples: <a href="">1</a> , <a href="">2</a> . <br><br>  Free install Photaf Panorama: <br> <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details%3Fid%3Dobg1.Photaf"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/871/ea6/934/871ea6934bbe01594d3ce931fbb1b907.gif"><br><br></a> <br><br>  Buy the full version for ~ 117 RUR: <br> <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details%3Fid%3Dobg1.PhotafPro"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/d13/0ae/f42/d130aef42c4f94ca5b25ca0c527b84f8.gif"><br><br></a> <br><br>  Following the review of several applications for shooting panoramas, we are forced to state that the pictures they produce are far from ideal.  However, a certain advantage was clearly observed in Pano.  In any case, it was she who showed not the greatest loss of the original resolution and the successful combination of adjacent areas of images. <br><br>  The final choice is always yours, and we will appreciate your comments and personal experience on this, as it turned out, non-trivial question. <br><br></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/146590/">https://habr.com/ru/post/146590/</a></p>
