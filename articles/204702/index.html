  <section class="page js-page"><h1>From 0 to 9 and from 9 to 0</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Hello. <br><br>  Have you noticed that the side computer keyboard and the telephone keyboard have buttons 1, 2, 3 and 7, 8, 9 mirrored vertically?  But this is so, although it would seem that both of them are digital keyboards. <br><img src="http://habr.habrastorage.org/post_images/6fb/f07/93f/6fbf0793f89e010eaab1c001e405ecc6.jpg" alt="image"><img src="http://habr.habrastorage.org/post_images/a6e/3da/df3/a6e3dadf3749ff1c7f9aae3b2d231acd.jpg" alt="image"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The reasons for the location of the buttons on the computer keyboard, in general, are intuitive: this is primarily a calculator, and it operates with numbers.  Arithmetic is arithmetic, and 1 is greater than 0, and the series of numbers ends with 9, so the numbers, <b>naturally</b> , are arranged in the same order.  It was still in those ancient times, when computers were large, and programs - small. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/7ac/114/f7c/7ac114f7cbc350ea7d963ca35045768d.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <i>One of the first calculator keyboards from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casio">Casio Model 14A</a> .</i> <br><br>  But the reasons for the different location of the buttons on the phone - quite curious.  The point here is what it is.  Old phones had a dial-up dialer, and 0 was next to 9 on it because of the functioning of the decade-step PBX: PBX ‚Äúcaught‚Äù the electrical circuit when dialing a number, which occurred when dialing a number in the dialer (they are heard as clicks or ‚Äú pulses "): when dialing 1, 1 click occurred, when dialing 9, 9 clicks occurred, and when dialing 0, 10!  Therefore, ATS is called "decade".  Accordingly, with each click (or ‚Äúpulse‚Äù) the arrow in a special device on the PBX moved to the next position, and the necessary number was dialed.  Therefore, this PBX is called "step".  In fact, the decade-step PBX is much more complex, it is a hell of an electromechanical device, but for its time it was a breakthrough in communications. <br>  With the arrangement of numbers here everything becomes clear: 10 is greater than 9, therefore, 0 must be located next to 9 simply by virtue of the technical solution of the dialer as a device for generating pulses.  It should be noted that in New Zealand and Sweden they still tried to follow the voice of reason and locate on disks 0 next to 1, but somehow these decisions did not take root. <br><img src="http://habr.habrastorage.org/post_images/901/914/ce1/901914ce18159d2def485a2a40000f9a.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <i>Warm <s>tube</s> dial.</i>

But not by transferring 0 (which might have been easier), but by changing the arrangement of the rows of keys {1, 2, 3} and {7, 8, 9}.  Here I can only guess, but still I would venture to suggest that this was done to unify keyboards and boards with calculators, for sure (at least at first) the keyboard and phone boards were ordered from calculator manufacturers, benefit, size were the same. <br><img src="http://habr.habrastorage.org/post_images/31f/d4c/660/31fd4c6600bedd82c2f084c12f7ee316.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <i>Familiar to all the modern look of the phone.</i> <br><br>  This story was continued in a rather unexpected industry: when ATMs began to appear, numeric keyboards were installed on them, and since the phone at that time was almost everyone who entered the target audience of users of new devices, it was still a long time before personal computers , <b>naturally</b> , the ATMs received a keyboard with a telephone key arrangement. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/169/7ba/efe/1697baefed0e050222eb28907598b73f.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <i>Type a pin to withdraw the salary.</i> <br><br>  And now - the most delicious.  From where there is a disk dialer. <br>  Invented the system of automatic dialing in 1891, a resident of Kansas City, Elmon Strowger.  He was the owner of the funeral home, and <i>his competitor‚Äôs wife worked as a young lady at a local telephone exchange</i> .  This nice lady, of course, gave all her callers to her husband.  The first automatic telephone exchange of a design of Strowger earned in 1892.  She received the nickname "no dames'n'damns telephone", that is, a phone without young ladies and curses.  I admire this man endlessly.  Do we know much the owners of the funeral homes, who have transformed and thrown forward the whole industry?  But the invention is very serious. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/2c5/d2c/916/2c5d2c91620f80a401ef65f440672150.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <i>Mr. Strowger himself.</i> <br><br><img src="http://habr.habrastorage.org/post_images/5b5/6c3/db5/5b56c3db5a4ca3acad080eca92eb43d3.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <i>Strowger switch, still without electromagnet.</i> <br><br>  In this way, due to competition in the funeral business in the 19th century in the middle of the USA, we now have two standards for digital keyboards on now similar devices.  Especially funny it looks on smartphones: <br><img src="http://habr.habrastorage.org/post_images/8b6/fb1/e50/8b6fb1e50036cdf7655970cc19155542.png" alt="image"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/461/106/95c/46110695cecb3a6abf837093c32b64af.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Thank you Wikipedia for the illustrations. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/204702/">https://habr.com/ru/post/204702/</a></p>
