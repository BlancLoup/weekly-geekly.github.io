Review and comparison with Skype for Business</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a27/27a/2f9/a2727a2f91724607b2b49cc0c6e4a1f7.jpg"><br><br>  In the <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/stss/blog/277013/">previous article about video conferencing,</a> I described the solution of the domestic developer Mind.  Readers have <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/stss/blog/277013/">noticed</a> that the comparison of professional software solutions with hardware looks one-sided, and a comparison is required primarily with similar products.  I have dedicated this article to just such a Russian product from <a href="http://trueconf.ru/products/">TrueConf</a> . <br><br>  TrueConf and Mind successfully work in the same market in Russia and abroad.  Software solutions VCS of these developers have as much in common, and many differences.  But this does not prevent them from developing and performing their tasks, occupying their niche and successfully competing with hardware solutions from VCs from Polycom, Cisco, LifeSize, and others. <br>  Having listened to the readers of the previous article, I will compare the functionality and cost of TrueConf with a similar software implementation of Microsoft Lync (Skype for Business), as the most common in the world. <br>  The purpose of this article is not to belittle or elevate one of these software products, namely, to compare the functionality and cost.  Conclusions everyone makes for himself.

      <br>
      Both of these products appeared long ago, and for many years have undergone significant changes.  The first thing that unites them is the main idea.  Both Lync (now Skype for Business) and TrueConf were conceived as a software suite of Unified Communications ( <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A3%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D1%2584%25D0%25B8%25D1%2586%25D0%25B8%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BD%25D1%258B%25D0%25B5_%25D0%25BA%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BC%25D0%25BC%25D1%2583%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B0%25D1%2586%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B8">UC</a> ). <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h1>  Positioning </h1><br>  First, let's open the basic concept of UC: <br>  <b>- Presence status:</b> information about the availability of the user (as a supplement - the degree of employment, mood, location: all that we see in modern messengers) <br>  <b>- Instant Messaging:</b> Chat <br>  <b>- Account management:</b> account consolidation, integration with accounts from various systems <br>  <b>- Telephony:</b> system integration with telephony (including IP) <br>  <b>- Audio conferencing:</b> group and point-to-point voice calls <br>  <b>- Video conferencing:</b> group and point-to-point video calls <br>  <b>- Automation of business processes:</b> sharing documents, databases, multimedia content <br>  <b>- File Sharing:</b> direct transfer or publication <br>  <b>- Remote demonstration: the</b> ability to conduct presentations, show your own desktop or a separate window <br>  <b>- Integration with postal services:</b> e-mail, voice mail, SMS, fax, etc. <br>  <b>- Cross-platform: a</b> client device can be a stationary PC, a landline phone, a mobile phone, an IP phone, a smartphone, a tablet, a laptop, a codec / terminal <br>  This list is not complete.  This can include everything that makes communication of people equivalent to communication in the personal presence of interlocutors, and even more convenient. <br><br>  So what is the difference between the approach to the implementation of UC in TrueConf and Skype for Business? <br><br><h1>  Functional </h1><br>  The basis of the Microsoft solution is the independent implementation of the maximum number of UC services on its own.  TrueConf was also originally developed as a UC-system, but the emphasis was placed on the development of the most relevant services.  The rest of the functionality was implemented at the level of maximum compatibility with external unified systems. <br>  The logic is simple: why invent, for example, your own telephony and increase the cost of your solution, when it is enough to ensure compatibility with popular PBXs (including free ones), substantially adding and expanding their functionality? <br><br>  Let's take a closer look at each of the services separately, and its implementation in TrueConf and Skype for Business. <br><br><h3>  Presence status </h3><br>  In TrueConf, the presence indication is very succinct. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b5d/4be/947/b5d4be9477c74cf382ce170e189ac068.jpg"><br><br>  There are three types of status: ‚ÄúOnline‚Äù, ‚ÄúBusy‚Äù and ‚ÄúOffline‚Äù <br>  As soon as the TrueConf client is launched, the user is highlighted in the address book as ‚ÄúOnline‚Äù.  If he participates in the conference - the status changes to "Busy".  Self status can not be changed. <br><br>  In Skype for Business, statuses can be changed manually. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/262/6e3/c07/2626e3c07e9448368584c517adff3f3f.jpg"><br><br>  If the user is not online, the status displays the absence. <br><br><h3>  Instant messaging </h3><br>  Text messaging in TrueConf is implemented in a separate window. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/03b/361/068/03b361068d51414ba1930371f4d43959.jpg"><br><br>  Chat is available both during the conference and independently from it.  From the chat window, you can make a call and start a video communication session. <br><br>  S4B chat is also called in a separate window.  During the conference, it sticks to the conference window. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/8f6/5dd/af1/8f65ddaf1b4b46379b8cc6b8061ce33f.jpg"><br><br>  From the chat window, you can make a voice or video call, or go to the demonstration of documents, whiteboard, desktop or create polls. <br><br><h3>  Address Book and Account Management </h3><br>  The TrueConf address book can be implemented both in a separate window and in conjunction with the general conference window.  It is formed by the user by adding contacts from the list of users registered on the server. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/292/b5b/6f8/292b5b6f88ba4b5b87a00c7d1c6929c9.jpg"><br><br>  If the server has an external address and the Federation option is configured on it, which is available on any paid version of TrueConf Server, then the user has the option to add users of an external TrueConf Server or users of the TrueConf Online cloud service to the address book. <br>  Users in the address book of the client application can be divided into groups created and configured by the server administrator. <br>  TrueConf Server supports integration with AD, so users can use their domain data to access the service. <br>  Avatars in the address book will appear in the next version of the client (currently only beta). <br><br>  Skype for Business Address Book has similar functionality. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c89/e0b/459/c89e0b459c334d958fb9eee450e6568c.jpg"><br><br>  It is possible to add users from your organization (from AD), and if the Federation is connected, S4B users of other servers or Skype users.  Also in the address book displayed avatars of accounts. <br><br><h3>  Telephony </h3><br>  TrueConf does not have its own PBX software service.  In spite of this, TrueConf Server has a built-in software SIP / H.323 gateway, for integration with existing IP telephony and hardware solutions of videoconferencing systems from other manufacturers.  It is also possible to register SIP phones or codecs on TrueConf Server. <br>  Setting up a server connection to IP-telephony takes 2 clicks - and you can already call through the TrueConf Client to extension numbers, landline and mobile phones, to collect from them voice and video conferences. <br><br>  Microsoft has its own IP telephony service.  Accordingly, S4B also supports participation in conferences of SIP participants.  However, S4B does not have direct compatibility with MCUs from other manufacturers.  Support is realized by using <a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/ru-ru/library/dn933920.aspx%3Ff%3D255%26MSPPError%3D-2147217396">an additional server as a gateway</a> . <br><br><h3>  Audio conferencing </h3><br>  For TrueConf, the concept of audio or voice conferencing is not entirely applicable.  In any group session, the user can use the camera, and can remain invisible, being an audio subscriber.  SIP phones, software terminals with webcams, cell phones and, in principle, everything that has access to the server through the SIP gateway can be combined into one conference.  Depending on the type of conference, in real time, you can control the settings of users, bring them ‚Äúto the podium‚Äù, including their camera, invite and withdraw from the event. <br><br>  The interface and capabilities of Skype for Business fully provide the necessary functionality for voice calls and conferences between S4B clients.  And when integrated with telephony and access from the outside - audio conferences are available with any telephone subscriber, SIP device or Skype user. <br><br><h3>  Video conferencing </h3><br>  Of all the services UC gives us the maximum sense of personal presence when communicating?  Of course - this is a video link. <br>  Multi-party video conferencing is at the core of the TrueConf solution.  VKS allows people to see and hear each other, regardless of the distance between the interlocutors.  And the better the service, the more convenient the management, the more comfortable it becomes to hold mass events through video conferencing. <br>  TrueConf service supports 4K resolution of video conferencing.  This means that on a 4K panel in a conference room, for example, you can display 4 x Full HD or 9 x HD participants without losing the original quality.  The maximum number of participants in the TrueConf symmetric video conference is 25 people.  At the same time, all participants can see and hear each other.  Up to 250 users can participate in the conference call: 6 of them are speakers (they can all be seen and heard), and the rest of the listeners (they are only heard).  But the moderator of the event in real time can change the speakers by activating the listener's camera. <br>  The user can change the layout of windows, detach the necessary window and transfer it to another display, maximize and change the scale.  The event can be recorded both on the client and using the server. <br>  The webinar mode allows you to connect to an event via a browser via WebRTC. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/388/c94/3ec/388c943eca2c441281d803e4f7921ec8.jpg"><br><br>  Skype for Business, in spite of all the charms UC inherited from Lync, in terms of video calling, unfortunately, Skype did not go any further.  In my opinion, the S4B VCS is in its infancy.  There is no doubt that in the future Microsoft will solve this problem and the problem of compatibility.  But so far - this is only a modest video addition to voice conferences. <br>  S4B video conferencing capabilities are limited to 6 participants in a symmetrical video conference - when everyone sees and hears each other.  The event can include up to 250 connections, but they will be displayed in turn, depending on the activity. <br>  The layout of the video conference participants is fixed - all streams are arranged in a horizontal row.  In order to keep the maximum image size vertically, the application allows you to crop the image to a square state.  If this is done, then the periphery of the frame to the left and right is lost ‚Äî for the meeting rooms it is no longer suitable, panorama is important there.  If you do not do this and leave the picture in widescreen mode - the total image resolution falls.  Well, about any 4K speech is not yet. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/0a2/66e/b55/0a266eb557124a9aa9a9e5ce98ace33d.jpg"><br><br><h3>  Business Process Automation </h3><br>  Compete with Microsoft in the field of business process automation is useless.  But if we consider S4B separately, then apart from a single accounting system and presence status, nothing connects it with MS Office, SharePoint and other services. <br>  TrueConf also does not have such functionality as superfluous - it can be easily integrated into the existing infrastructure. <br><br><h3>  File sharing </h3><br>  TrueConf allows you to send a file to the addressee directly during a communication session.  He can accept and save it locally, or may reject. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d50/677/7d7/d506777d78354c9ab11217125425fc5b.jpg"><br><br>  The Skype for Business interface does not allow you to send files directly, but when a communication session is established, the file can be shared and any member can download it.  You can customize the access rights to the content. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/64e/9d6/777/64e9d677740a44568d37cc2147db6798.jpg"><br><br><h3>  Remote demonstration </h3><br>  TrueConf Client supports several options for remote content demonstration: <br><br>  1. Presentations <br>  The presentation is shown in a separate window - it can be brought to another display.  VKS at the same time continues and participants do not cease to see each other. <br>  The interface, I confess, does not have enough tooltips - I had to tinker to understand what was happening. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/157/d0b/464/157d0b46431a4d98a77f3eca93730040.jpg"><br><br>  Functional pleased, as compared with S4B, there are additional convenient options.  In general terms: you can upload a presentation, add additional slides to it in the form of pictures, delete slides, and swap them.  This means that the presentation can be molded from several presentations and existing images without access to PowerPoint and graphic editors - everything is inside the TrueConf client.  Then, it can be saved as a slide show and show all the participants of the event.  For all participants, the presentation will appear in a separate window, which is convenient - you can put it on a separate display.  The presentation management is retained by the demonstrator. <br><br>  2. Electronic board <br>  Editor imitating flipchart.  The ability to draw, write, use geometric shapes.  Support image loading, capturing the contents of a window or screen area. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/786/6d4/a46/7866d4a46eaf49aa9447217a16dcc297.jpg"><br><br>  Unfortunately, the whiteboard is only available for point-to-point video sessions. <br><br>  3. Demonstration of the desktop. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/7ee/e21/c7a/7eee21c7a9254b78bd6d0c99f2a85122.JPG"><br><br>  A TrueConf user can show his desktop to all participants of the event.  If necessary, any member can request control of the desktop.  If the demonstrator gives his consent, the management of the desktop is transferred to the conference participant who requested management. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/bc9/5ac/1dd/bc95ac1dde614eb596e79560cb2c84e2.jpg"><br><br>  Skype for Business includes the following remote content demonstration features: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/549/2ad/ac8/5492adac82594b6bbbf943b81cdad6cf.jpg"><br><br>  In the "Advanced .." section there are 3 more functions hidden: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/2ab/5c2/7eb/2ab5c27ebca64f9fb541a250ccb477dc.jpg"><br><br>  1. Presentations <br>  After downloading the presentation file, there is no possibility to edit it, but there is a functionality for independent viewing of the presentation. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/962/96a/fce/96296afcef114d58b6e46de4fdefa580.jpg"><br><br>  The speaker looks through the pages - everyone sees his slide.  But the user has the opportunity to rewind the presentation back or forward.  Clicking the button "Return to the mode of the speaker" again returns to the current slide of the speaker. It is also possible to transfer the right to give the presentation to others. <br><br>  2. Electronic board. <br>  The same flipchart - loading images, lines, brushes, stamps. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/299/3d6/fd2/2993d6fd275740f597ae791b220a0908.jpg"><br><br>  3. Demonstration of the desktop. <br><br>  In addition to the demonstration of the desktop, S4B has the opportunity to show the participants of the event all the desktops or a separate application window.  Management can be requested from the demonstrator, or transferred to one of the participants. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/799/68c/c9f/79968cc9fc5c411dbcd209940b4541c3.jpg"><br><br>  In my view, Skype for Business demonstrates one drawback: the demonstration window is not displayed in a separate window, it displays thumbnails of video streams, but not all, but only two of yours and one of the participants.  You can collapse your picture, but you cannot add other participants.  These miniatures can be detached and placed in a separate window, but still only two.  The main video conference window is returned only after the demonstration is over. <br><br><h3>  Integration with postal services </h3><br>  TrueConf allows you to make newsletters, send invitations by mail and plan events through the calendar. <br><br>  Skype for Business has shared accounts with Outlook - to compete with them, it seems to me, is meaningless.  General registration, single presence status and avatar - this is very convenient!  But all this requires, of course, the additional role of Exchange and the license with all that it implies. <br><br><h3>  Cross platform </h3><br>  TrueConf Server is installed on MS Windows Server (from 2008 and up) or MS Windows (from 7 and up).  Client applications are supported on Windows, Mac OS X, Linux, iOS and Android.  It is also possible to connect via WebRTC through a browser.  Mobile client supports connection to both cloud and local service. <br><br>  Skype for Business also has clients for common operating systems, with the exception of Linux.  To implement the connection through the browser, an additional role will be required - another license and a local or virtual server. <br><br><h3>  Cost of solution </h3><br>  To estimate the cost of the decision, I will do 3 calculations: <br>  - The cost is only software - without taking into account the hardware. <br>  - Cost from scratch - i.e.  all the necessary software and hardware to start the VCS service in the new infrastructure. <br>  - The cost of the cloud service. <br><br><h4>  Comparison of the cost of the software part of the solution </h4><br>  To install TrueConf Server, you need a physical / virtual server running Windows.  For both examples I will use the implementation for 250 users. <br>  MS Windows Server Standard 2012 R2, 1pc.  - <b>44'815.</b> <br>  TrueConf Server + 250 client licenses - <b>2'750'000r.</b> <br>  WinSvrCAL, 250pcs.  - <b>482'350.</b> <br>  LDAP option, UDP Multicast - <b>40'000r.</b> <br>  <b>TOTAL: 3'317'165r.</b> <br>  <b>Per user: <b>13'269.</b></b> <br><br>  To install Skype for Business for 250 users with access from outside you need at least 6 servers. <br>  MS Windows Server Standard 2012 R2, 6pcs.  - <b>268'878r.</b> <br>  MS SQL Server 2014 Standard, 1pc.  - <b>45'567.</b> <br>  MS Skype for Business Server 2015, 1pc.  - <b>185'141.</b> <br>  MS ExchgSvrStd, 1pc.  - <b>34'225r.</b> <br>  ExchgStdCAL, 250pcs.  - <b>1'061'750.</b> <br>  WinSvrCAL, 250pcs.  - <b>482'350.</b> <br>  SQLSvrStdCore, 6pcs.  - <b>1'040'490</b> <br>  SfBSvrStdCAL, 250pcs.  - <b>514'523r.</b> <br>  SfBSVrEnCAL, 250pcs.  - <b>1'772'850.</b> <br>  <b>TOTAL: 5'405'774r.</b> <br>  <b>Per user: <b>21'623.</b></b> <b><br></b> <br>  There are 2 things to consider: <br>  1. The price of TrueConf is not only lower, it is not tied to the exchange rate.  Russian software - the price is fixed in rubles. <br>  2. TrueConf licenses are competitive and are used only for online users - this means that there can be any number of accounts, and only the online user ‚Äúeats‚Äù the license.  In MS, the situation is different - either devices are licensed or users are licensed - and it doesn't matter whether they are online or not. <br><br><h4>  Zero cost comparison (SW + HW) </h4><br>  Since TrueConf Server needs only one server for all roles, and for S4B the developer recommended at least six (in different configurations for different roles) - the difference in the cost of one port increases significantly. <br>  <b>TrueConf: 14'069r.</b>  <b>for 1 user</b> <br>  <b>S4B: 27'623r.</b>  <b>for 1 user</b> <br><br><h4>  Comparing the cost of cloud service VCS </h4><br>  Using a similar service for business, in my opinion, is not entirely acceptable, but, in any case, both developers offer similar services. <br>  <b>TrueConf - 3,240 rubles / year</b> <br>  <b>S4B - 3'795 rubles / year</b> <br><br><h3>  findings </h3><br>  As I said at the beginning of the article - I will not draw conclusions, everyone decides for himself.  In various situations, the choice may be inclined towards either one or the other.  It all depends on the objectives and the degree of penetration of Microsoft into the existing infrastructure.  One thing is clear - it is certainly easier to build enterprise-class VKS from scratch based on TrueConf Server.  It takes 15 minutes: just <a href="">download the</a> 157 MB <a href="">distribution</a> , install it and the server is ready!  I devote the next part of this article to installing and configuring TrueConf Server. <br><br><h3>  System requirements </h3><br>  The first feature of TrueConf Server software is that when using the TrueConf Client client software, the load on the server is extremely small.  This is due to the fact that in this case, the main burden of video coding falls on the client terminal (any average-performance PC), and the server is engaged in sampling and ‚Äúsmart‚Äù flow switching.  The second feature is the use of <a href="http://trueconf.ru/features/core/scalable-video-coding.html">SVC</a> technology in the processing of threads by client devices.  Namely: the client sends and receives streams with the necessary resolution, but not with the maximum. <br>  For example: 9 participants with FullHD cameras and FullHD displays.  Everyone has different layouts - some watch all the streams on one screen, others unfold the speaker on a quarter of the screen, and someone else unfastened one of the participants and unwrapped it on the whole screen on the second monitor. <br>  What does the client software do, which was deployed full screen and a quarter of the screen: a multi-layer stream is sent to the server side ‚Äî a FullHD layer for clients who watch it in full screen, an HD layer for those who deploy it to a quarter of the screen, and a low resolution layer for everyone else using the standard 3x3 layout. <br>  Clients viewed in low resolution will not send FullHD and HD streams to the server, thereby unloading the network and receiving client devices.  The server, in turn, selects the necessary layers and sends them to clients, depending on the layout of the windows. <br>  Thus, any client encodes a stream equivalent to the resolution of its camera and decodes streams with a total resolution not higher than the resolution of its displays.  And almost any modern PC can handle this task. <br><br>  Thanks to this technology, the entry-level video conferencing server can handle dozens of connections via the TrueConf Client.  But the situation changes when it is necessary to connect a SIP / H.323 or WebRTC client to an event.  Transcoding takes significant server computing resources. <br>  Working closely with TrueConf, we developed and tested several typical server models for video conferencing.  The server configurator STSS Flagman TrueConf contains a <a href="http://www.stss.ru/products/video_conference_system/server_videoconference_trueconf.html">convenient calculator for</a> calculating the computing power of the server for various typical tasks. <br>  To calculate the cost of a VCS solution TrueConf "out of the box", it‚Äôs enough to score parameters that load the server with transcoding into the calculator: <br>  - <b>Number of SIP / H.323 connections</b> ‚Äî this parameter reflects how many hardware codecs or IP videophones will participate in video conferences at the same time. <br>  - <b>Number of WebRTC sessions</b> ‚Äî the parameter that reflects how many simultaneous events with WebRTC users will take place on the server. <br>  - <b>HD recording to the server and RTSP HD broadcasting</b> - each this procedure does not weakly load the server, but if you perform these actions in one event, then you can choose one thing, because  transcoding will be done only once.  This also applies to WebRTC. <br><br>  By filling in the required fields of the calculator, we get the optimal Server Configuration Option and a link to the appropriate model. <br>  Having passed to the configurator of the recommended model, we select the necessary Variant of the computing subsystem of the server and the license of TrueConf.  We select the disk subsystem, based on the requirements for volume and fault tolerance, and we set up personal workstations and meeting rooms with equipment.  The configurator issues a retail price, and you can send a request for special offers through the form. <br><br>  The STSS Flagman TrueConf solutions line includes 4 models in various form factors and for different loads: <br><br>  <a href="http://www.stss.ru/products/video_conference_system/server_videoconference_trueconf/TrueConfMini.4-004LH.html%3Fconfig%3D"><b>TrueConfMini.4-004LH</b></a> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/9d1/938/154/9d19381541fc4e66a581805dc2e89ccd.jpg"><br><br>  VKS desktop server mainly for work through a TrueConf client.  Provides up to 250 connections.  There will be enough performance for one WebRTC session with recording to the server and an RTSP broadcast or for connecting a pair of SIP / H.323 devices. <br><br>  <a href="http://www.stss.ru/products/video_conference_system/server_videoconference_trueconf/TrueConf110.4-002LF.html%3Fconfig%3D"><b>TrueConf110.4-002LF</b></a> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f16/682/800/f16682800a9e4a33b96f81cbc264cd58.jpg"><br>  Analog of the previous model, but in 1U-performance. <br><br>  <a href="http://www.stss.ru/products/video_conference_system/server_videoconference_trueconf/TrueConf216.4-004LH.html%3Fconfig%3D"><b>TrueConf216.4-004LH</b></a> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d42/6dd/776/d426dd7764004ef2b5ea2c9e5e837152.jpg"><br>  High-performance server VCS rack.  In addition to the 250 participants connected via the TrueConf Client, this server provides support for up to 24 SIP / H.323 connections.  Thus, on the basis of this server and the TrueConf software, it is possible to organize video conferencing in an existing infrastructure based on hardware codecs and video IP phones. <br><br>  <a href="http://www.stss.ru/products/video_conference_system/server_videoconference_trueconf/TrueConf226.4-008LH.html%3Fconfig%3D"><b>TrueConf226.4-008LH</b></a> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f97/654/846/f976548460244c2ebdeba0598f057c3f.jpg"><br>  An analogue of the previous model in the 2U version, based on the <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/stss/blog/273247/">T-Platform</a> domestic development platform <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/stss/blog/273247/">E-Class</a> .  The disk subsystem of this server will allow you to create an archive for long-term storage of records of all events held on this server. <br><br><h3>  Installation, configuration, admin panel </h3><br>  Free download distribution <a href="http://blog.trueconf.ru/how-to/install-lan-videoconferencing-system.html">TrueConfServer</a> .  Following the instructions on the link, install it, make manipulations with free registration and go to the Web-admin area. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/2e6/c51/e29/2e6c51e29a8e4a898b85b0d0c8d956fd.jpg"><br><br>  A temporary license with full functionality is already installed on my server, so Free license extensions will be slightly different - 1 conference is available in the basic version, 6 participants, 1 of which may be SIP. <br>  If you have a real business task for testing, you apply to TrueConf and you are given the necessary functionality extension for the duration of the test. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e61/734/f10/e61734f10f9e4c1f9b634661b814269d.jpg"><br><br>  In the settings, you can save and load server configurations, manage general settings of applications, view system usage reports. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/13f/1b6/060/13f1b6060e494581bb68f026856e1b0c.JPG"><br><br>  In the network settings, you can manage internal addresses, add external ones to ensure access to the server from outside. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/3ad/4e2/e95/3ad4e2e95c994f5c8fd7c57219832a0a.jpg"><br><br>  In the SMTP settings, the connection to the mail service is configured and the templates for mailing-notifications are edited. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/13e/d27/a19/13ed27a19f5c4135a2728f0127bfa722.jpg"><br><br>  In the SIP gateway settings, we specify the settings for connecting to the telephony server, and the server is ready for calls via SIP. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ae7/e46/ab4/ae7e46ab40534cbd89ce442a4ec0f4e7.jpg"><br><br>  Similarly, we make the necessary H.323 gateway configuration, if required. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/122/79f/a50/12279fa50af1489ca13bb6fde73d164d.jpg"><br><br>  Federation is available only in a paid or extended license.  This feature allows you to cascade TrueConf servers - it is possible to connect to both external servers and servers located within the local network.  The Federation also allows you to hold events with the invitation of users of the TrueConf Online cloud service (similar to Skype for Business calls to Skype subscribers). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/dfe/49b/a5e/dfe49ba5e3614888a327f0767c04984f.jpg"><br><br>  The web settings specify the URL for linking, the logo and administrator data are loaded for display on the guest page. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/82e/048/f98/82e048f981d145a78030a32c9446164d.jpg"><br><br>  Security settings indicate access restrictions.  For remote access via Web in the OS, you need to add the user to the TrueConf Server Admin security group. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d43/35b/a75/d4335ba751c54910988e5953d6614c68.jpg"><br><br>  To be able to connect to WebRTC events, you need to configure HTTPS.  You can upload a white certificate, or use a self-signed one.  In this case, users will have to download the certificate from the guest page for the first time, install it and restart the browser.  After these manipulations, you will be able to send audio and video through WebRTC. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/7c7/4e2/f2b/7c74e2f2bbfc42b7ad7ed969eb79f122.jpg"><br><br>  In the section "User Accounts" and "Groups" the administrator creates accounts, distributes them into groups with the allocation of access rights. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/2d5/4ec/eb4/2d54eceb4c9d4f308aab2ab4077f33c6.jpg"><br><br>  In the LDAP / AD settings, you can disable the use of local user data and configure the unloading of credentials from AD. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f82/e82/77c/f82e8277c08c423a87f81e31f5c2e1f0.jpg"><br><br>  In the "Group conferences" section, the administrator can create events of various types, invite and delete participants.  You can schedule a conference and make a mailing with invitations to the mail. <br>  This screen shows the real conference, <a href="http://trueconf.stss.ru/c/777">accessible to everyone on our server</a> .  About how to test the service, I will write below. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c84/5b6/f72/c845b6f72adc4b17858f6d05db2ebb39.jpg"><br><br>  You can record events on clients (with participants permission) without server load, or you can enable permanent recording on the server. <br><br>  ,    <b><a href="http://trueconf.ru/products/server/server-videokonferenciy.html">  TrueConf Server</a></b>     ‚Äî    <b><a href="http://trueconf.ru/support/online-help/server-help.html"> </a></b> . <br><br>         ‚Äî                    .      ‚Äî  TrueConf Client     . <br><br><h3>   ! </h3><br>      .
