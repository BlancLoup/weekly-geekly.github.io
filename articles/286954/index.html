      What an interesting country is Germany? It would seem that you know German - go to the magistracy and study your health.  But it turns out that almost all master programs are ‚Äúsharpened‚Äù exclusively for English.  Seminars, lectures, not to mention the works themselves - all this in English.  You can shine your knowledge of German on the streets, in restaurants, and in supermarkets.  Although in these places most people can calmly communicate with you in average English.  For a person whose main foreign language is German, finding a program on it is quite difficult. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0071c5">Cost of</font> </h2><br><br>  As is known, education in Germany is free (with the exception of land where a semester fee is provided).  This is very tempting, and especially for those students who have decent knowledge and lack of funds. <br><br>  Semester collection is a separate topic for discussion, and, for the most part, political.  We will not go into the details of the history and objectives of its introduction, but simply state the very sad fact of collection in some lands (for example, in Bavaria it amounts to 500 euros, and in Hessen there is none at all).  Add to this the funds that will be needed for accommodation, food, the purchase of essential goods, as well as medical insurance - and receive an amount of approximately 600 euros per month. <br><br>  Of course, much depends on the specific region: if in Bavaria you have to ‚Äútighten the strap‚Äù for this money, then somewhere in the east or north of Germany the amount is enough to ‚Äúgo to a restaurant or a movie a couple of times a month‚Äù.  Despite the prevailing stereotype that everything is expensive in European countries, in Germany this is true only for travel: transportation is really expensive, and everything else, including food (which is often provided just in gigantic portions), utilities and clothing, can be purchased in about for the same money as ours. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0071c5">University Choice</font> </h2><br><br>  It is pointless to advise which university to enter.  It depends, first of all, on your specialization, level of knowledge, experience in the chosen activity, preferences and financial possibilities.  All the nuances simply do not count, but because no one can choose the best university for a student than himself. <br><br>  There is a <a href="http://ranking.zeit.de/che2014/en/">ranking of leading German universities</a> .  You can use it, but it should not be forgotten that each university has its own direction and specific training.  For example, one of the most interesting universities in the field of IT is HPI-Posdam.  Each graduate student there is assigned a professor who oversees his work and helps to cope with the inevitable difficulties.  A significant role is played by the established business ties of the university - a rare master after graduation is left without high-paying work. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0071c5">Financing</font> </h2><br><br>  You can earn a scholarship to study in Germany before enrolling in a university.  It is considered as a specific grant, the amount is about 700 euros.  But not every person who is good or an excellent student is paid, but only those who manage to convince the college that it is he who deserves to receive a scholarship from the state. <br><br>  In order to receive a scholarship from the German Academic Exchange Service ( <a href="http://www.daad.ru/">DAAD</a> ), you must write a letter of motivation in which to justify the expediency of a payment.  Of course, the letter must be compiled by a person who has a higher education. <br><br>  It seems to be nothing complicated, but it seems so only at first glance.  It is necessary to make a motivation letter correctly, it is desirable to outline in detail the plans for the future.  You need to tell in the smallest detail how the funds allocated will help you on the path to a better life and the benefits to science and society.  In general, Germany wants to protect itself as much as possible from unsuccessful investments in "hopeless" students. <br><br>  Try to dream and paint, who you see yourself in the next 5 years.  It does not matter whether your Napoleonic plans come true or not, the main thing is that they should sound as convincing as possible.  You must have a goal and a clear plan of action. <br><br>  So, the letter is composed and sent.  The first part of the test is over.  It remains only to wait and hope that you will be lucky, and you will find yourself in the list of those lucky ones who will be invited to Moscow for an interview at the end of the first round.  There you will most likely have a chance to chat with a German professor.  Basically, he can ask you about anything.  But you will definitely have the opportunity to demonstrate your knowledge of the subject area, tell a little about yourself as an individual, solve several logical problems.  You will be checked for general adequacy, will try to make a psychological portrait of the person.  It is not necessary that all the answers are correct - it is more important to show yourself as a thinking student with good analytical skills. <br><br>  In addition, do not forget about the presidential program "Global Education". <br><br>  <a href="http://educationglobal.ru/">Global Education</a> is a Russian program for financing students who independently enroll in foreign universities.  More than 200 universities in 27 countries are already participating in the program.  The program finances not only education, but also accommodation abroad. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/4a3/fbe/669/4a3fbe669c004d0fa197fb211c5071de.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h2>  <font color="#0071c5">Admission process</font> </h2><br><br>  In order to reinsure yourself as much as possible, it is better to consider several backup options in case you do not enroll in the desired university.  Although it is extremely unlikely: to earn a scholarship is much more difficult.  But if in the end you don‚Äôt do it anywhere, then of course you will not receive scholarships. <br><br>  Examinations for admission to universities in Germany is not provided.  Despite the fact that all specialties are divided into non-competitive and competitive, the maximum that threatens you is an additional interview by phone. <br><br>  Universities do not have any single application deadline.  Some establishments provide for filing applications for several years in advance.  The main defining document is the motivation letter.  In addition to it, you will need translations of the school certificate and diploma (notarized), a certificate of language proficiency (for English - <a href="http://toefl-test.ru/">TOEFL</a> or <a href="http://ielts-test.ru/">IELTS</a> , for German - <a href="https://www.testdaf.de/">TestDaf</a> ) and CV. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0071c5">Visa application</font> </h2><br><br>  After receiving the invitation of the university it is recommended to immediately begin to deal with issues of visas and housing.  We need to act as quickly as possible.  Paperwork lasts longer than it seems at first glance.  Especially for those who are not scholarship holders.  A whole month can pass from your appointment to the interview. <br><br>  For those who managed to get a scholarship to study, there are separate conditions.  Such students do not need to go for an interview, they are given a visa for free, and all necessary documents are drawn up directly in the academic exchange service.  However, for each district there are separate features that are better specified in advance. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0071c5">Search for housing</font> </h2><br><br>  The sooner you start ‚Äúmonitoring‚Äù housing prices, the more likely you will be able to find decent apartments at an affordable price.  There are special organizations that search for housing for students.  For example, <a href="http://www.studentenwerk-berlin.de/">Studentenwerk</a> .  But if you go there right on the eve of departure, it‚Äôs far from a fact that there will be free places.  Still, the hype before the beginning of the school year is quite large, and everyone wants to get comfortable. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0071c5">How much money will be required for sending documents?</font> </h2><br><br>  Formally, admission is free, but many costs will have to pay on their own.  For example, to send documents.  This can be done in different ways (for example, via Russian Post, DHL, Pony Express or EMS Russian post).  Each of the services operates at a different speed and at a different price (which may differ by several times).  The speed of delivery often depends on the distance of your settlement from Moscow. <br><br>  The money will be needed not only for sending documents, but also to certify the transfer of the diploma from a notary.  It often happens that notaries refuse to certify documents translated by third parties and require you to use the services of a full-time translator.  So include this item of expenditure in your budget.  It may also be necessary to pay for the verification of your documents by a German university. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0071c5">Do or not?</font> </h2><br><br>  Student years - the golden time of our lives.  The likelihood of receipt, and even more, the receipt of the grant depends on how much time and effort you have devoted to preparing for all the necessary stages.  Successes! <br><br>  <i>Next time we will share material about education in Holland.</i>  <i>It turns out that this direction provides a lot of opportunities for graduates.</i> <br><br>  The author of the article is Vyacheslav Davidenko, founder of <a href="http://www.mbaconsult.ru/">MBA Consult</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/286954/">https://habr.com/ru/post/286954/</a></p>
