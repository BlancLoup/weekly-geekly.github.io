Makhost behaved badly, Oversan, Space Technologies and Hosting Community have been rubbing and bargaining for a long time, but now everything is working.  I want to believe that it will work in the future, and maybe even without changing ip-addresses, prices and other conditions. <br><br>  And if not?  One hoster, one DC, one platform for colocation still have, albeit insignificant, but the probability of falling.  What to do? <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  Backups </h4><br>  It is clear that they must be fresh, accessible and complete.  And they should be.  It's amazing how many people have them old or ‚ÄúI didn't merge the database‚Äù. <br>  I have only 2 questions: <br>  <b>1</b> .  I have backups.  These are 600 tar.gz files, located either in Ireland, or at Agave, or at the partner‚Äôs site, with which we change backups.  How long does it take to get 300 working sites from them with mailboxes, crowns, customized parsers and all sorts of data imports?  And the panel, which is all tied. <br>  Lot! <br>  <b>2</b>  Maybe I am a kettle and do not understand anything in sausage cuts, but I have little doubt about removing a full backup from a working server.  While we pour, the data changes.  Files, DB, letters come and go.  At a minimum, this is a non-perfect, incomplete copy.  As a maximum - inoperable. <br>  And it seems that this is not eliminated by any protocol.  Soothe me? <br><br><h4>  Spare site for key customers </h4><br>  We have an online shop <a href="http://700shin.ru/">700shin.ru</a> (now the NS are changing back, you will not see it).  Crowns, orders, two-way synchronization, etc.  Mail from google. <br>  For a long time, in order to avoid such ambushes, a synchronous mirror was made on 1gb.ru - <a href="http://alt700shin.ru/">http://alt700shin.ru/</a> .  There the need to redelegate and the main domain. <br>  But mess with him a lot.  The solution is expensive, time consuming and not universal. <br>  Mirroring issues are complex and not completely clear to me, but it seems to be a solution to this.

    <h4>  Faith in foreign hosters </h4><br>  Maybe there is better.  But that there was 100% reliable - I do not think.  Problems in case of accidents or bases you will have a larger caliber than in this country. <br><br><h4>  Server under the table </h4><br>  Many do this, now there will be even more those who want.  But the problems are known and not very pleasant: a thick channel, a ping, backup electricity, an Internet.  Even if you have the same qualifications as the hosting staff, you will not solve all the problems. <br><br>  Are there any other solutions?  I did not invent. <br><br>  Came up with this.  Perhaps, expensive and initially hemorrhoid, but in the case of accidents saving. <br><br><h4>  Solution </h4><br>  I have a good server in makhost, anlim traffic and raids. <br>  A server with the same screw is bought, a mirror is poured onto it with the same OS, a panel (the license issue is solved) and data.  Let there be a weak percentage and an expensive channel, it is important that this is all efficient in case of an accident.  Let it stand in the states. <br>  Configured daily (weekly if we do not pull on speed) synchronization of everything.  Panels, mail, databases, files, logs.  As far as I understand, this will not cause problems with Debian and other Nix systems. <br>  Since all of my 300 domains have 1 and the same NS, which we also support, in the event of an accident, this domain will need to specify a new IP.  Maybe it can be solved through automation and faster, without redelegation. <br><br>  Then in the case of major or minor troubles, you with beer and popcorn watch the boiling of shit, but you are not at all as scary as others. <br><br>  Questions: who to choose, how to set up synchronization, how to quickly switch and how much it will cost.  What problems did I notice? <br><br>  Makhost we pay for all 9200 a month.  If such a backup solution costs 4600 (another piece of hardware and another channel), I agree to seriously consider it. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/90349/">https://habr.com/ru/post/90349/</a></p>
