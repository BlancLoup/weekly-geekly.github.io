  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Photo for online catalog</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  <i>And you thought that all the pictures on the Internet were from stock?</i> <i><br></i>  <i>(c) Alter ego of the Bagel cat</i> <br><br>  What could be better than a pair of black classic men's shoes on a white background?  Certainly not snow-white ankle boots or high boots with heels.  Hello, I am <b>Pavel</b> , and I am a photographer of clothes and accessories for the Gardeobus online catalog.  Someone produces shoes, someone - jackets and shirts.  I produce sets of about 300,000 characters - files of photographs of wardrobe items on a white background.  I'll tell you a little about how these photos are obtained.  For a start on shoes - my favorite subject of photography. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/564/436/9e5/5644369e5dab6ddedc881b4d4e7457fc.jpg" alt="image"><br>  The highest photographing performance is shooting shoes.  70 pairs per hour?  Nonsense, it happened more.  The scheme is worked out and simple.  Items should be on a white background?  We place the pair in a <b>light-cube</b> (folding white cube on semi-rigid frames, covered with a white, light-scattering cloth).  Need to light a couple?  On the sides we put two <b>pulsed light sources</b> with <b>softboxes</b> .  If the shoe is dark enough and the light is intense enough, the substrate under the pair is exposed to completely white.  Camera in hand, men's shoes with toes to the right, women's left, in order of numbers ... Idyll, conveyor!  But then an employee of the store (oh, yes! The filming is usually done right on the customer‚Äôs sales area, but more on that later) transmits a pair of women's boots, 60 cm high, on heels.  The useful area of ‚Äã‚Äãcontact with the ‚Äúground‚Äù is about 30 square cm. The earth itself is a <b>pair of layers of polystyrene</b> , with a total thickness of one and a half millimeters (it is easily rolled into a tube, mobility is above all).  So, this whole ‚Äúshoe pyramid‚Äù is swinging inside the light cube and falling.  We put it again - it falls again.  With a head and hands we climb into a light-cube, put it on an honest word, gently protrude, still touch the upper edge of the cube with the head, the pair falls again, hits the wall, the wall is a tightly set soft box, the soft box staggers, the dangling <b>radio synchronizer</b> on the <b>monoblock is rocking</b> , the product of the Chinese workshops perceives all this as a personal insult and about 300 joules of a millisecond flash in an enclosed space stuns my brain.  From this, the head usually shudders, again touches the entire structure and receives a second discharge, fortunately a bit less power, since the monoblock capacitors do not have time to recharge.  As I have not yet become an epileptic - I can not imagine.  Solution: <b>snap the medical clamp</b> on the tops of the pair, put the pair in a bit.  The next challenge is Cinderella's shoes.  Shine.  Try to take a picture of the mirror so that nothing is reflected in it.  Black "flags" on the sides, changing the location of the light, forgetting to light the white substrate under the shoes, press the trigger, casting time in the graphic editor in the graphic editor manually. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/42d/e2b/d5d/42de2bd5d33408b7072b4504394d524a.jpg" alt="image"><br>  Now about the location of the shooting.  I need about 4 square meters for all the equipment and me, but not every store has enough free space.  Plus, ordinary visitors go around the store, who are not to blame for anything, but are forced to turn around for each flash.  Of course we try to shoot early, while there is no one.  But not all store employees understand why they were pulled out of the warehouse so early in the day and to give it to an unshaven, long person with a camera, a hell of a flashing machine and a strange tick (from the discharge of flashes directly to the brain).  There is no place for me in the warehouses, but once such was found in the basement store kitchen.  16 square meters of silence, tranquility, dirty floor and the stench of a trash can ... <br><br>  It is very useful for a photographer to have a <b>hank of fishing line</b> with him - hang up the handles of bags.  Well, I do not like when they hang like ears of a spaniel.  <b>Polarizing filter</b> reduces too aggressive glare on lacquered areas.  <b>Extender</b> at least seven meters: a convenient place to shoot is not always near the nearest outlet.  If the wire is stretched across the entire hall, it will not be superfluous to ask the staff for mats to cover it.  And then climb into the light-cube to correct the strap on the sandals, the buyer will touch the extension and another lightning in a confined space
