But I love to photograph and watch other photos.  There is an excellent resource photosight.ru, on which there are many great photos. <br><br>  But what a bad luck - I didn‚Äôt have enough time to look through this site every day, and at times it was terribly slow.  In addition to this, I wanted to keep an archive of photos that I liked, so that they would sometimes be reviewed later. <br><br>  That is why 3 years ago I wrote a parser that pulled photos from the photosite that I could like (analyzing comments, ratings, etc ..) and put them into my daddy, which I looked through once a week.  Several of my friends wanted to join me, and I opened the web interface to this.  That was my first startup.

    <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  The question of how ethical it is to rob a photo with photosight.ru let's postpone.  The policy of the site itself does not prohibit it.  Near each photo is the author.  In the profile of each author - a link to his site.  Each site has an address for contacts and at the request of the author his photo is deleted (there were no more than ten such requests). <br><br>  Then there were several sites - landscapes, portraits, nudes.  These sites I did not promote, did not advertise, they were for myself.  And then, one day, 30 thousand people came to me in one day, and I was looking for something stupid for two hours - what is the server crashing?  Since then, 5-10 thousand people a day have started walking to me and creating a terabyte order per month of traffic.  There was a question to pay for the server. <br><br>  At first I tried to sell websites for a long time (they were a burden to me with such a flow of visitors and traffic), but I did not succeed.  By the way, I tried to sell them for $ 2000.  Later, I was persuaded to put AdSense on them (at the beginning I was scared against, but then I found a way to do it, without much disturbing the viewing of the photo).  And she went to drip money :) <br><br>  Income, as well as attendance is floating.  As I did not try to increase them or at least control them - this is not in my power.  Attendance of 5-10 thousand people per day.  Income - $ 600 - $ 1500 per month (spread over 3 years).  At the moment, this project has brought me ~ $ 35,000.  This is the most profitable of all the projects that I did, although initially I did not plan to earn money on it.  Income for July of this year, for example - $ 800. <br><br>  Weekly, I give him 3-4 hours for various kinds of improvements.  Sometimes (once a year) I improve the design of one of the sites (some of them still do not have it).  The cost of it is $ 80 per month for server rental. <br><br>  Where is this miracle, you ask?  Here is the link: <a href="http://www.outdoor-photos.com/">www.outdoor-photos.com</a> Other sites, if desired, you will find yourself.  One of them, <a href="http://www.nu-photos.com/">www.nu-photos.com</a> (cautiously, boobs) does not bring money: it‚Äôs prohibited to put adSense on it by the rules, and I don‚Äôt want to put any porno adverts on it.  Why is he?  At one time I did not find a single collection of artistic nude.  And I decided to do it myself. <br><br>  If you have questions - wellcome;) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/68097/">https://habr.com/ru/post/68097/</a></p>
