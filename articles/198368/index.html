  <section class="page js-page"><h1>About project MyEducationPath. What will be the higher education of the future and why do you need MyEducationPath</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  A couple of days ago, my project MyEducationPath ( <a href="http://myeducationpath.com/">http://myeducationpath.com/</a> ) was on the list of companies in Habr√© as part of a program to <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/tm/blog/197634/">support start-ups</a> .  Thanks, Habr! <br><br>  In this first post I want to talk about my project and the idea that led to it. <br><br>  2 years ago I studied the online course Introduction to Artificial Intelligence from Stanford University.  I was impressed with the results and became interested in the new movement in the development of online courses - MOOC (mass opening of online courses).  In 2012, there was just a boom around this topic.  Everyone was talking about Coursera, edX and similar startups.

      I also came to the conclusion that higher education will change.  But, in my opinion, just online courses themselves are not enough.  Courses are only part of the educational process.  Real changes will come only when other services of modern universities can be replaced by free or low-cost counterparts. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h4>  Why and how higher education can change. </h4><br><br>  In my opinion, the main driver of change will be the cost and accessibility of higher education in the world.  In some countries, higher education is qualitative but expensive, in others cheap but poor quality, in others, access to education is closed to some segments of society.  Internet and communication technologies can change the situation and lead to a significant reduction in the cost of quality higher education.  For universities, the time will come when it will be necessary either to revise the principles of work or simply go bankrupt and disappear. <br><br><h4>  What a higher education future might look like. </h4><br><br>  A modern university sells a wide range of services in one package.  Theoretical training, practical exercises, group work, ‚Äústudent atmosphere‚Äù, organization of practice in real enterprises, certification and certification, sometimes job placement upon completion and, finally, administration of all these processes. <br>  The student pays once for everything and does not know what part of his money is spent on each specific service. <br>  But this model of the university was invented several centuries ago.  Can it not be optimized?  Indeed, in our days a lot of things can be automated. <br><br>  I predict that in the near future this model will be changed.  Independent companies will provide certain types of services.  Some companies will offer online courses for theoretical studies (this is already happening).  Others will do certification and testing of knowledge and skills (as CLEP or Excelsior College is doing now), still others will offer practical training services in educational laboratories, etc.  For group robots and creating a special ‚Äústudent atmosphere‚Äù, the services already offered by MOOCCampus will do. <br><br>  One university can be replaced by many small companies.  As a result, learning will become more dynamic and personal.  The student can choose from a variety of options at each step.  From an economic point of view, a large organization (university) will be replaced by many smaller ones.  The entry threshold for starting a new business will be significantly reduced, as a result of competition prices will be reasonable and adequate. <br><br><h4>  So why do I need MyEducationPath </h4><br><br>  The task of the MyEducationPath service is to help the student organize the learning process.  This website is designed to automate the management of the learning process.  He should replace the university administration and do the same work faster, more dynamically, personalized and most importantly cheaper (ideally - for free). <br><br>  MyEducationPath will help: <br><ul><li>  pick up courses for training; </li><li>  plan a training program to achieve a certain level of knowledge; </li><li>  find certification providers to validate knowledge and skills; </li><li>  find other students for group study; </li><li>  find places to study or long-term accommodation with other "free students"; </li><li>  keep u publish personal education history (can be included in resumes for job search); </li><li>  share experiences with other students; </li><li>  search for internship offers in companies; </li><li>  find training laboratories for practical classes in some subjects (physics, chemistry, etc.); </li></ul><br><br>  and everything else to help the student get the desired level of knowledge and skills in the chosen specialty for the best price and time. <br><br>  MyEducationPath should be a resource on which the student will open his account after graduation and will use it all his life, because you need to improve and learn all his life.  MyEducationPath will be able to plan a new program based on the student‚Äôs education history and new goals. <br><br><h4>  MyEducationPath is a meeting place for all participants in the higher education system of the future. </h4><br><br>  The following diagram demonstrates how the work and communication of participants in the educational process in the new environment can be organized and what is the role of the MyEducationPath in this process. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/7b1/85d/248/7b185d24842fe30b3ce66482f150ecd9.png" alt="image"><br><br>  At the moment, MyEducationPath is almost a year online.  The main task now is MOOC aggregation, that is, to collect course lists from various sources and submit in a convenient form for searching.  But I am working on other tools for which there is no real use, but I am sure that the need for them will soon appear. <br><br>  One of the best results at the moment is the constructor of learning paths.
