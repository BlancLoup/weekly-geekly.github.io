      The founder and pioneer of the joint shopping service in Russia was Biglion.  It was about him I learned in the first place.  He registered on the site and, until recently, acted only as an observer. <br><br>  I watched the development of the CoupeCupon service from its very foundation and even participated in contests where 10 coupons to a beauty salon and 10 iPhones were played.  One of the coupons I managed to win.  I also took part in the drawing of iPhones, honestly attracting my friends and acquaintances to the registration on the Kupi Coupon website.  Of course, I did not win any iPhone, although the published list of winners, indicating the number of people involved, clearly made it clear that something was wrong here ... <br><br>  Then followed the communication with the site administration on Twitter, where after a few of my statements that the contest was unfair, I was asked to send my email (apparently for propriety) in order to clarify the "numbers for your confidence."  Today is the second month since the email was sent.  Well, okay, on this I closed my eyes a long time ago. <br><br>  A gift coupon (for visiting a beauty salon) was sent to me all the same.  It was a coupon worth 1200 rubles, and, under the terms of the promotion, I could use the services of this salon for the specified amount.  The desire to take advantage of this offer disappeared from me immediately, as soon as I visited the site of the partner of the action and got acquainted with the price list ... I could afford 1,200 rubles, perhaps, to wash my hair after the haircut.  What to say about the price of the haircut itself ... <br><br>  I forgot about the coupon. <br><br>  Another surprise for me was a letter from the KupiKupon site administration with information that the owner has changed from a certain time, and he (the salon) no longer serves clients on the coupon.  Instead, a coupon for the same amount was offered at the Miami Bowling Entertainment Center. <br><br><img src="http://saveimg.ru/pictures/30-06-10/6f7815bc36a9783ee1272ed6944b2ae3.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Having seen the price list on the website of the entertainment complex, I booked one track for 4 people for 2 hours.  At the same time, the amount specified in the coupon was not enough for 2 hours of play (the evening hour on a weekday cost 790 rubles), and we planned to pay the missing 380 rubles in cash. <br><br>  The manager greeted us with a smile, and to the question, ‚Äúwill we be able to use this coupon from you,‚Äù we received an affirmative answer.  As a result, 1.5 hours of play and 400 rubles of money spent ... At the same time, we had a coupon worth 1,200 rubles, which, under the terms of the same coupon, should have been more than enough to pay for the specified time.  But the manager told us that for this coupon, the cost of an hour of play at our institution is 1,200 rubles (instead of the usual 790 rubles), and you will have to pay the rest 30 minutes with money ... <br><br>  I think the coupon screenshot speaks for itself. <br><br>  The level of institutions - below average.  The equipment is very old, the balls are broken. <br><br>  After all this, the service, except as a universal frill, can not be called. <br><br>  As for the other two services - Darberry and Biglion, here, too, not everything is as rosy and fabulous as it is written on their websites. <br><br>  In Darberry, on their Facebook page, by email, on Twitter, I repeatedly sent questions regarding the ongoing action, because the description of each specific action was very well written (in terms of marketing).  I have never received a response to any of them.  Accordingly, I haven‚Äôt purchased a coupon for the stock I‚Äôm interested in (why buy a cat in a bag?).  Hence the question - why create integration with social networks, if there is no sociality from the creators and owners of the service?  And there can be no talk of any support at all. <br><br>  In Biglion, this is easier - they have a forum for each action where you can ask a question and GET an answer.  One of the shares of Biglion, I once took advantage too.  It was a coupon to visit a restaurant (I don‚Äôt remember the name, and the essence does not change) - the impression is that as soon as you showed the coupon, the attitude towards you as a customer changes dramatically and, moreover, for the worse.  You are not perceived as a serious client, but simply dismiss you and try to get rid as soon as possible.  It is understandable - they have already received their money, and who in our country will do its job normally after the service has already been paid? <br><br>  Dear habocoobschestvuyushchestvo, in this post I in no way want to desecrate the business model used by these services.  Moreover, I believe that, for example, in the same America (from where this business model was copied), this service is implemented in a completely different way, in terms of attitude towards the client, and is directed not at a frank fundraiser, but primarily at the client.  I tried 3 of these services on my own personal experience and just want to warn you that there may be frustration behind the big discount. <br><br>  And for myself from all of this I made a conclusion (once again), and this conclusion concerns our country and mentality: KHALYAVA, DISCOUNTS = DECEPTION. <br><br>  Be attentive and do not let us fool yourself. <br><br>  <strong>PS After this topic, the KupiKupona administration reacted with great attention to my problem, for which I say thank you.</strong>  <strong>I was contacted by one of the managers of the KupiKupon service by email and gave my exhaustive comments on my problem.</strong>  <strong>The result of our correspondence was a call from Miami bowling from a manager who accepted a coupon with apologies and an offer to play bowling for 1 hour and get back the money that we took by mistake.</strong> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/97811/">https://habr.com/ru/post/97811/</a></p>
