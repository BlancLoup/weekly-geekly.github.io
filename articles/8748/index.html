And I am looking for a Resource with a number of properties, each of which individually, as a rule, is more or less known.  However, the combination of these properties, as I see it, turns the desired Resource into a qualitatively new Internet product. <br><br>  <b>I need a</b> resource that would be designed for <i>true professionals</i> in any field of activity.  In other words, a Resource user is an intelligent person with knowledge and experience in a certain field. <br><br>  <b>I need a</b> resource for a set of services provided and their capabilities similar to MySpace.

        </script>
      <br>
      <b>I need</b> to additionally present in the Resource service to establish and maintain multi-level professional contacts such as LinkedIn <br><br>  <b>I need</b> each registered user (Resource member) to post detailed information about himself, up to a resume with the chosen level of confidentiality. <br><br>  Before registration, <b>I need</b> each user to undertake obligations to follow something similar to the Code of Honor, the gross violation of which would lead to the immediate separation of the violator from the Resource. <br><br>  <b>I</b> also <b>need</b> to clearly see the absolutely transparent rules for evaluating information and participants of the Resource, moral and material incentives for the information provided. <br><br>  <b>I need a</b> Resource with powerful and well-defined search engines.  At the same time, the possibility of ‚Äúpeeping‚Äù at all third-party sites, links to which are located in the Resource, should be required <br><br>  <b>I would like to</b> see an international Resource where everyone can speak their own language.  At the same time, all declared languages ‚Äã‚Äãmust be equally well supported by search engines. <br><br>  <b>I would like the</b> Resource to speak with users and invite them to speak among themselves in a normal human language.  A minimum of jargon and invented words. <br><br>  <b>I would like</b> any information placed in the Resource to be assessed by users according to a very simple criterion: <i>agree / disagree.</i>  <i>No shovels and funeral teams!</i> <br><br>  <b>I would like</b> any participant to be assessed only by the number of his messages, and, above all, taking into account their ‚Äúinconsistency‚Äù and ‚Äúrelevance‚Äù.  <i>In this case, no karma and similar things.</i> <br><br>  <b>I would like to</b> have simple mechanisms for automatically posting rubricated announcements of messages from my third-party blog, blogs of other participants and / or blogs recommended by them. <br><br>  <b>I would like to</b> receive a selection of recommended and / or top messages, both according to the generally accepted algorithm, and taking into account my filters. <br><br>  <b>I would</b> like <b>to</b> be able to receive very brief notifications about any new message from the participants I selected or on selected communities, categories and topics (and, importantly, not only my own). <br><br>  <b>I would like to</b> see a unified approach, in which ‚Äúofficially‚Äù it is proposed to post any links.  This also applies to the so-called news (digg), and bookmarks (del.ici.us) for cognitive materials, useful resources, etc. <br><br>  <b>I would like to</b> see the design of the Resource optimally combining moderate conservatism with new style trends.  Regular structure, maximum information content, no trendy frills.  <i>Simplicity, but not primitivism.</i> <br><br>  <b>I would like to</b> receive a commission from the revenue for advertising placed next to my messages. <br><br>  <b>I don‚Äôt mind</b> going through a trial period after my registration, during which all my messages would be subject to prior control (moderation).  Who and how carries out such control is important, but so far the second question. <br><br>  <b>I do not mind the</b> subsequent selective moderation.  I consider it necessary to introduce some reduction factors for violations of the Code. <br><br>  <b>I do not mind</b> paying a moderate amount for all or some of the services of the Resource and for the costs associated with information control. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  { <i>This test should go after habracut.</i>  <i>If the tag didn‚Äôt work again, it‚Äôs not my fault :)</i> } <br><br>  I did not do it myself, and I don‚Äôt remember whether I met any special research on the user audience of social networks (except, perhaps, for blogs).  However, long working with the most diverse resources of Web 2.0, I will take the liberty to say that the age of the average user news2.ru, for example, hardly exceeds the 25-year mark.  I assume that for the real MySpace it is even lower.  It is easy to see that the <i>Resource, which I am unsuccessfully looking for, is designed for a more mature audience.</i>  <i>Good or bad, if you look at the problem from a marketing point of view?</i>  <i>I can prove it is good, but this is already a separate conversation.</i> <br><br>  <i>Indeed, if youth knew, if old age could.</i>  <i>I do not consider myself an old man either physically or, especially, morally.</i>  <i>However, I think that after all a few (let's say) older developers of the same habrahabr.</i>  <i>Working earlier in the spaces of the former Soviet Union, I got used to bringing all my ideas to a working state: be it CAD systems, AWPs, control systems, magazines or newspapers.</i>  <i>He did a lot himself, and he could always create the necessary team, and enlist the support of the relevant structures.</i>  <i>Unfortunately, my position is now different.</i>  <i>I am far from my former homeland, but on a new one without business connections and a good language, and even at my age, it is rather difficult to break through something.</i>  <i>Although the technical requirements detailing all points of the above Resource concept, and the business model are practically ready.</i>  <i>However, alas, I have already lagged behind real programming.</i>  <i>So you have to be entertained by blogs, using them, in particular, for setting the task ... What if she is interested in anyone ... Not only grow clones, at the end of the ends!</i> <br><br>  <b><i>A more comprehensive version of this note (with all the links and some explanations) can be found in my blog (http://www.itechbridge.com/forum/index.php?showtopic=16344).</i></b>  <b><i>You can also vote on the issue raised here.</i></b>  <b><i>Thank you in advance for voting.</i></b> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/8748/">https://habr.com/ru/post/8748/</a></p>
