  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Why landline phone numbers will be relevant for a long time</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  You can often hear that landline numbers are yesterday.  Everything is okay with cell phones, and if you need a memorable number, you can just pick it up and buy it from your operator.  Indeed, landline telephones, as a communication tool, are gradually becoming a thing of the past, but short city numbers ‚Äî especially with the Moscow code ‚Äî are still at a great price.  Why so? <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  City numbers with codes 495 and 499 will be found on all sorts of websites for a long time, and there are at least three reasons for this: <br>  1. Prestige.  This is the main advantage of the "Moscow registration".  The city code of telephone numbers of the capital is known by the whole country.  Out of habit, most Internet users identify the number +7 (495) XXX-XX-XX with the Moscow office.  A chain ‚ÄúMoscow office = large office = must be taken!‚Äù Is built in the head.  At the same time, no one thinks that this number is not a city number, but a virtual one, connected via an IP-PBX. <br>  In real life, such a focus can increase sales, or, at the very least, it will profitably distinguish the company from its competitors.  And this sooner or later will still lead to commercial success.  No matter what they say, but people are attentive to contacts, and when they see a long mobile number instead of a city one, they think: ‚ÄúWell, if they couldn‚Äôt go bankrupt with an office with a pipe, should these guys be trusted at all?‚Äù.  And the matter is not only in the human factor - even the Yandex search algorithm is always attentively looking at whether there is a city number on the site or not. <br><br>  2. Ease of use.  Moscow number is redirected to a virtual PBX.  The office can move, and the number will remain unchanged. <br>  The only condition - the presence of the Internet.  If a company uses an IP PBX, then the number with code 495 can be made multi-channel, and then it will be possible to receive several customer calls simultaneously using a single phone number. <br>  A virtual Moscow number is a solution not only for companies, but also for ordinary people who want to point out metropolitan contacts on a business card.  You can simply buy a number and forward calls to your cell phone.  And now you are not a freelancer Vasya Ivanov, but an expensive designer from Moscow.  Another example: an SMM agency whose employees work remotely can also use a Moscow city number - this will immediately add solidity.  The service is not tied to a specific place and can work using the forwarding settings to a mobile phone or computer.  Why pay for an expensive office in Moscow, when you can sit in coworking or even at home and at the same time remain a ‚Äúsolid businessman‚Äù? <br><br>  3. Relative availability.  The price of "Moscow residence permit" depends on the tariff plan, on the conditions of service, as well as on the combination of numbers - beautiful numbers, of course, are more expensive.  For example, in CloverTel, connecting a regular number will cost 890 rubles, and the price for a beautiful number can reach tens of thousands of rubles.  There is an active demand for those and other numbers.  In the face of falling sales, regional businessmen are ready to invest in their image and do not spare money to buy a beautiful Moscow number.

      What conclusion can be drawn from all this?  First, in the near future a lot of ‚ÄúMoscow‚Äù offices are waiting for us.  And secondly, if you do not want to fall for the bait, carefully read the section "Contacts".  Thirdly, if you yourself think about the beautiful Moscow room, hurry up - they are dismantled like hot cakes. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/299476/">https://habr.com/ru/post/299476/</a></p>
