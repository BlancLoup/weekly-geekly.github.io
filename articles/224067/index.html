In this post I would like to tell you about my project <a href="http://profishop.us/">Profishop.us</a> - this is a turnkey solution for accepting orders from wholesale customers.  First of all, I would like to draw attention to the benefits and relevance of the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthis project.  If you are a distributor and sell any goods in bulk, this service is created for you.  Now the majority of wholesalers take orders in the old-fashioned way in ordinary Excel files, by phone or, maximum, through the standard online store on Bitrix or another popular engine, which entails a lot of inconvenience.  We have created a user-friendly interface that integrates with the seller‚Äôs 1C base, i.e.  those orders that buyers will make in their personal account, instantly appear in the seller‚Äôs 1C database.  The personal account is optimized specifically for bulk purchases and is free from the shortcomings faced by wholesalers when working on traditional store engines or manually.  I would like to note that each distributor has a separate address of his store, in which only his products are presented. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Introductory video: <br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/BcdFGWkDYL4" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><h5>  Features and benefits of the service </h5><br><ul><li>  Multifunctional API, with the help of it the distributor integrates its 1C base with Profishop. </li><li>  Personal account for the buyer, in which he selects products through his convenient interface and makes orders from his distributor. </li><li>  The ability of the buyer through the API.  Having an online store and purchasing for it through Profishop, you can automate the order process.  Thus, when the customer places an order in your online store, he will immediately be reserved for you at the distributor in his main base 1C. </li><li>  Different prices for different types of customers. </li><li>  Separate subdomain for your account. </li><li>  Affiliate program: everyone who registers on your referral link will bring you 20% of the purchased services. </li></ul><br>  Connecting the store occurs within a few hours.  If required, we provide full support for any of the convenient forms of communication.  Much attention was paid to the simplicity and convenience of the product, with Profishop it is really easy and pleasant to work.  We have high-quality <a href="http://profishop.us/docs">documentation</a> with video and examples of ready-made solutions. <br><br>  From the very beginning, the main thing for us was the simplicity of the product and its convenience for users.  This Profishop differs from competitors, which, by the way, quite a bit.  Now the service is completely ready for work, but only half the work has been done, it is ahead of its promotion, which is quite difficult in such a narrow and specialized niche.  To do this, we hired a full-time marketer, we are preparing the launch of contextual advertising, and are preparing for a large-scale telephone call to potential customers to bring them information that we have opened up and can significantly simplify the wholesaler's life.  By the way, among those distributors to whom we have already told about the service, and who were not too lazy to try, a large percentage became our customers.

      The idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe project arose a few years ago, when I helped my partner organize the work of two online stores, wholesale and retail.  There were no special problems with retail, but with wholesale it was hard.  I didn‚Äôt want to do what most distributors have done when regular prices are sent to customers, with no pictures, with irrelevant balances and, often, different formats.  The client wanted to automate everything as much as possible, to provide relevant information in a convenient way.  At first a simple PHP + MySQL script was written with 1C integration using the ODBC connector, but then the code was completely rewritten and the <a href="http://profishop.us/api-docs/">API was</a> added via GET, POST with data output via JSON format.  When other clients became interested in our solution, I firmly decided to do service. <br>  Speaking <a href="http://profishop.us/prices">of prices</a> .  There is a free tariff with a limit on the maximum number of users simultaneously online: 5. ‚ÄúMedium business‚Äù tariff for 2000 rubles, in which the total number of active sessions and other parameters are significantly expanded, there are such features as image loading and your own domain name. <br><br>  We have a lot of interesting plans for the future: adding new features to increase convenience, creating ready-made solutions for all versions of 1C (now there is only UT11), changes in the design of a personal account, but our main goal is to popularize wholesale automation, t. to.  in fact, it is very different from retail, and it seems to be not paying attention. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/-x/wa/fp/-xwafph06imnlkkgjpvgmp9dguq.png"></div></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/224067/">https://habr.com/ru/post/224067/</a></p>
