  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Reflections on karma, rating and comments. My habrasuicid</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  For a couple of years I have been reading Habr.  Almost a month and a half I am a full habravchanin.  And so the other day I wondered: Why am I putting pluses?  Why put minuses?  Why plus / minus karma?  When commenting?  What moves me?  How do others do it?  Why?  Began to observe, ask friends and acquaintances.  Two friends asked why almost nothing is written on the web site - they have great articles in their own blogs.  Gradually, the picture began to emerge, in my opinion not very bright, but such is life.  Perhaps this article is habrassicid.  If it turns out that way - I want to immediately thank those who wrote practical comments to my topics (there are not so many of them), especially <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/cryptochild/" class="user_link">Cryptochild</a> , for reading my article in the sandbox, believing in me and giving an invite. <br><br>  Questions, questions, no answers, but there are reflections.  Maybe dear habrazemlyaki will be able to answer them, maybe at least they will think about it, and maybe someone will change something.  If at least a couple of people think about it - it is already good. <br><br>  So: <a name="habracut"></a><br>  1. Voting for the article.  After reading the article, we can tyrknut in "like / dislike" and "raise karma." <br>  Read some article and liked it?  We press both without thinking - and an article plus, and karma.  Did not like?  We click on ‚Äúnot liked‚Äù and, be such an opportunity, almost sure that it will be the same as ‚Äúdrop karma‚Äù as an automaton.  Fortunately there is no such button.  (Thanks UFO?). <br>  Article somehow not hooked?  We do not press either one or the other, even if it is clear that the author spent a month of work on it ... What, not so?  Always wrong?  Right?  And for the other charge? <br>  Who even thinks about the consequences of their actions?  About how these clicks affect what we see on Habr√© tomorrow?  The fact that the assessment of a specific article - is inherently far from the same as the assessment of the author?  After all, a person mediocre or even unpleasant may well be that he writes a smart article or does excellent translations, but trolls in comments.  And about the fact that an interesting article in itself is not yet a criterion for assessing the identity of the person who translated it from English?  And what, in the case of translation, does plus in karma mean an assessment of the professionalism of the translation?  If we happily add both karma and an article for a less intelligible translation of an article by a certain famous shark of a feather, and lean on and minus it in full for the minor flaws of someone who may have made a mistake on trifles, but he invented and wrote himself and was not afraid to show it to others , to entrust the secret - what will we read tomorrow?  A news portal with a compilation of good translations or something else?  What do we want to read tomorrow at Habr√©?  Article authors directly?  Translations?  Crossposts?  Interesting news with minimal comments posted and a link to the source?  Did someone ask himself this question?  Someone thought about the topic "how do I, personally, I want to see Habr tomorrow"? <br>  I do not know the answers, but I thought about the responsibility for tomorrow by clicking on the "+" or "-" today ... I thought that the buttons "like" / "do not like" in essence mean "I do my part to on Habr√©, this type of article was bigger / smaller. ‚Äù  And the voice for karma essentially means ‚ÄúI want this person to publish articles further and bring his friends, I like the way he writes and what he writes about,‚Äù and the minus in karma is ‚ÄúI want this person to shut up and I didn‚Äôt write anymore, I don‚Äôt want to see him or his friends in Habr√©. ‚Äù  Many of us think about it by pressing the plus and minus signs?  Who, before pressing the minus on karma, looks at what else this person wrote, so as not to harm Habra inadvertently, using a good author for the only comment error on someone else's article with a high rating?

      2. Comments.  It's generally sad.  70-90% of comments can essentially be reduced to a few more honest ones: ‚Äúand I do it differently, and therefore your way is no good just because it‚Äôs not like I do,‚Äù ‚Äúwell, you and duraaak, not like me "," Someday you may also become so clever as I "," did not understand anything, but in my opinion it is nonsense "and" I have nothing to say on the subject, but you have a comma missing "or even" it certainly can and so but yesterday we caught such a bream when fishing, ‚Äùand the discussion continues on the bream. <br>  A comment on a topic usually leads to a whole bunch of answers meaning, in fact, ‚Äúyes, I think so too, but you have a comma here missing‚Äù.  Who is it for?  Cann‚Äôt the readers themselves understand that there is no comma here, or is this a way to at least somehow prove to be ‚Äúsmarter‚Äù?  It's sad. <br><br>  3. Voices for comments - two buttons ‚Äúgood comment‚Äù and ‚Äúbad comment‚Äù.  What is a good comment?  Everyone understands in his own way, but who of us, hand on heart, tries to do this in an unbiased way, based again on how we want to see Habr tomorrow, on the basis of how many comments on the topic, based on how many Can he be useful / harmful to someone? <br>  According to my observations, most often a minus in a comment means "I think differently, but to break into explaining my point of view."  The author of this comment will take this minus as ‚Äúyes, they are all sheep, that‚Äôs what to talk with them about,‚Äù and will not return to the topic.  So we received a constructive exchange of views - everyone is unhappy, each in its own way, did not establish the truth, but the topic was buried. <br>  Often, of course, minus simply means ‚Äúdon't argue with me!‚Äù Or ‚Äúthey taught me differently, but I don‚Äôt know how to explain my point of view,‚Äù sometimes it's just the voice of fans in a dispute between two parties.  That is, "I do not know which of you is right, but I support him, because he is a plus, and you are a minus." <br><br>  4. And finally, I will call this ‚Äúlate return‚Äù.  When the topic is already closed (outdated) and the votes are not accepted, I don‚Äôt agree with the author of the article (or comment), but I can write my own comment, what can I do?  Right on the minus minus in karma, so that it was disgraced, I am dissatisfied and lazy with atoms, I have to get discharged somewhere, but to think lazy ... <br><br>  Who is to blame and what to do?  No one is to blame and at the same time we are all to blame.  Habr is what we all do together.  It doesn‚Äôt matter whether we do it consciously or not. <br>  At the moment, many people prefer to post here only what is ‚Äúfashionable‚Äù and ‚Äúpublic hawala‚Äù.  What is checked and generally suitable.  It‚Äôs accepted to scatter in every article, on the subject ‚Äúnot my moped, I just posted it,‚Äù or ‚Äúplease don‚Äôt have karma, I didn‚Äôt want, I‚Äôm small and stupid, don‚Äôt offend me a little ...‚Äù those for whom it is important to show themselves cool are simply because of the fact that they dared to write without taking their opinion into account (here I am too, bowing, just in case, at the beginning of the article).  It is customary to write only about what is understandable and easy to explain.  All that departs from the standard "Hawk" - this risk. <br><br>  Yes, I exaggerate a little so that you can see better what can be left in the shadows.  I just want at least some part of the Habranarod before pressing "+" / "-" to think: "What am I doing?  How will this affect the Habr√© and the author of the article?  I want just such a result? <br><br>  It would also be nice if at least some of those who perceive the minus button as ‚Äúdisagree with the author‚Äù and without thinking press it anyway, they would rather explain the reason for their disagreement a little more often, with what is ARGUMENTED.  According to the principle: I do not agree, minus just by writing a reasonable refutation.  No arguments?  So do not touch minus, he is not for you!  After all, it may be that both are wrong, in a dispute (not in a quarrel, namely in a dispute) the truth is born. <br><br>  Yes, the habr mechanism is self-regulating, rejecting those who do not fit and averaging, summing up under a common denominator.  The mechanisms of regulation of IMHO are very thoughtful and effective in their essence, but thoughtless use of them, active minus for the sake of ‚Äúomitting in order to prove that I am cooler‚Äù and the passive position of those who really create what is interesting with Habr - all this can lead to sad consequences, and already leads, and therefore there are groans on the topic "Habr is not the same."  So noah - do what depends on you, so that he becomes again!  And before you do - think about what you do! <br><br>  Why Khabrasuitsid?  Yes, because I now distribute the minuses and those who recognized themselves, and those who did not recognize but did not understand, and those who ‚Äúfor other principles‚Äù, and those who translate articles, and those who got moans about ‚Äúhabr is not a cake‚Äù, and those who groan, and fighters for grammatical and syntactic sterility, and all sorts of other "controllers of correctness."  Many people prefer not to admit their mistakes and do not like those who prevent them from doing so.  They also distribute those who in this paragraph will see an indirect hint of "give pluses".  Nothing, I'm ready for this, if the acc is not closed - I will gradually return to the plus.  If they close, I will read as before read-only.  If only the benefit was. <br><br>  Well that's all.  If at least a few people think about it, then my habrasuicid was not in vain.  So tomorrow and I will be more interesting to you in Habr√©.  Thanks to those who understood me.  I apologize to those who do not understand.  Maybe goodbye, and maybe until we meet again. <br><br>  PS Tell me, please, which blog is it better to place? <br><br>  UPD: I read the comments.  I wanted to add: <br>  The purpose of this post is not to complain about life, not to cry, do not scold.  The goal is to remind that each of us creates tomorrow's habr himself.  Gentlemen, think what you are doing when you press minus.  Think what you do when you press plus.  There are no universal solutions and silver bullets.  You just need to be aware of the responsibility to yourself and the community for what you press and the consequences of this.  There is no "Habr is not the same", is "I do Habr is not as it can be."  Think, gentlemen, think ... </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/92426/">https://habr.com/ru/post/92426/</a></p>
