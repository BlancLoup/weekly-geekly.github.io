  <section class="page js-page"><h1>IT Brunch Free Online Conferencing Platform - ".NET brunch" May 18</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  In this article, I decided to share our project, which Timothy Yevgrashin and I do in our spare time as they say ‚Äúfor the soul‚Äù.  This is the platform for free online conferences <a href="http://itbrunch.com.ua/">IT Brunch</a> , which we launched a year and a half ago.  The closest will be held <b>on May 18</b> and will be devoted to the .NET platform.  If you are interested in learning more about IT Brunch or even participating, welcome to cat. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  So, I will tell you about what IT Brunch is.  In order to weed out comments with recommendations about the ‚ÄúI am PR‚Äù column, I‚Äôll say at once that we don‚Äôt sell anything to anyone in this project and he lives on bare enthusiasm.  A year and a half ago, we once again started the topic of geography of participants at well-known conferences in the post-Soviet space.  Always ‚Äúlocal‚Äù participants dominate over guests from other countries.  And this is not good - there are no alternative views, adopting positive and negative experiences, and just interesting inter-ethnic communication.  I was also always offended by people who live far from conferences and other educational events (especially for Russia).  And not all of them are so enthusiastic to spend a lot of time and money and get to Moscow, St. Petersburg or Novosib. <br><br>  Thus, the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãcreating a project was born that would help collect participants from everywhere to interesting educational events.  As planned, the geographical position should not affect the possibility of participation.  So <a href="http://itbrunch.com.ua/">IT Brunch</a> appeared.  IT Brunch is a practical online conference, each of which is dedicated to a specific topic from the IT field.

      Brunch is derived from <b>BR</b> (eakfast) and (l) <b>UNCH</b> , that is, it is a meal that combines breakfast and lunch, you can call a late breakfast on a day off.  This time is great to spend it with benefit and learn something new.  That is why we chose this name for our conferences. <br><br>  IT Brunch is a platform for getting practical information, sharing experience and ideas.  Each participant has the opportunity to ask a question.  Here, not a single question from the participants will be left unattended and will not be missed.  To take part in any IT Brunch conference, you do not need anything other than a computer, the Internet and headphones.  And of course desires.  You can participate in conferences from home, from the office, on vacation, in nature, you do not need to go anywhere - we are always ‚Äúnear‚Äù! <br><br>  Conferences are held <b>on Saturdays</b> , once <b>every 2-3 months</b> , each online meeting lasts a maximum of <b>4-5 hours</b> .  We carefully select the speakers, so that all the time you hold a conference with maximum benefit!  In a year and a half, <a href="http://itbrunch.com.ua/schedule/">5 IT Brunch conferences</a> have already passed, each of which gathered several hundred participants.  We are trying to spread all conference materials in open access.  Due to this, even more participants have the opportunity to get acquainted with them. <br><br>  The format of the conference is very simple.  Each speaker has <b>20 minutes</b> to his report and another <b>10 minutes</b> to answer participants' questions.  This format makes you focus on useful information and not waste your time.  Participants can ask questions in the course of the entire report on Twitter (the hashtag <b>#itbrunch</b> ) or in the online system that was selected for the conference.  The organizers voice all the questions at the end of the report. <br><br>  The upcoming IT Brunch conference is called <a href="http://itbrunch.com.ua/dotnet/">.NET brunch</a> and will be held <b>on May 18th</b> .  The program is almost completed and next week we will publish a detailed schedule of reports.  We will be glad to see you among the participants, as well as the ideologues and speakers of the next conferences.  We are waiting for your feedback and suggestions! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/178625/">https://habr.com/ru/post/178625/</a></p>
