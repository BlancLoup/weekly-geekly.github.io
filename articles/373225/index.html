  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How Beeline networks have become a headache for installers</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/cdc/9e9/88d/cdc9e988d4d1419eb6f44ff3c7c0ff60.jpg" alt="image"></div><br>  Outsourcing is now a fashionable word, and the principle of such cooperation is increasingly practiced by large companies.  The trend has come to <a href="http://nag.ru/">telecom</a> .  The largest mobile operators have been interacting with vendors for several years, in fact giving their networks to the ‚Äútearing apart‚Äù a whole chain of subcontractors of various sizes.  The trouble is that often maintenance work on infrastructure is performed by low-skilled workers. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  In recent years, VimpelCom has been engaged in optimizing its own expenses.  The striped operator has already <a href="http://nag.ru/articles/article/30741/rabota-na-udal-nke-korporativnyiy-opyit-vyimpelkoma-.html">sent a</a> substantial part of the ‚Äúoffice plankton‚Äù to work from home.  Effective managers report on the success of the project and the undoubted benefits primarily for the company. <br><br>  Much earlier in VimpelCom they decided to outsource the maintenance of their own infrastructure.  The work was distributed among the leading vendors of Nokia, Huawei and <a href="http://shop.nag.ru/search%3Fword%3DEricsson%2B">Ericsson</a> .  In 2014, third-party organizations serviced the company's networks in 55 of the operator‚Äôs 78 branches.  The company itself ambiguously assesses this approach to work, noting that about 62% of the accidents on networks occur through the fault of vendors.  At the same time, outsourcing allows you to avoid the many costs associated with maintaining a large staff of service personnel. <br><br>  That is why the operator is not going to refuse such a model of work, and in 2016 he held another closed tender to service its networks.  The performers are the same: Ericsson, Huawei and Nokia Siemens Networks.

      Let's forget today for a moment about the reports of ‚Äúeffective managers‚Äù and take a look at the process of servicing networks from the inside using the example of Huawei.  How is this work done and how does it threaten the operator. <br><br>  The Chinese vendor services Beeline networks in several regions.  The company does not have its own staff of specialists, therefore, the work is distributed among subcontractors.  Then everything goes according to the standard scheme, which can be observed, for example, in the construction industry.  In the absence of their own branches in the regions where the companies won the competition, work again has to be given to subcontractors. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c74/6cb/bb5/c746cbbb508449b9941ca271c6ba6df6.png" alt="image"></div><br>  Here everything is very clear and nothing new.  These questions arise directly at the stage of execution of work.  Naturally, <a href="http://shop.nag.ru/search%3Fword%3Dhuawei">Huawei</a> controls subcontract organizations for which a special application SmartQC was developed. <br><br>  The program is designed for smartphones working on android, and every ordinary installer should have it on their machine.  The application with the help of GPS tracks the location of the employee, the monitoring of the performance of work is observed by performing a certain algorithm of actions that will have to be performed using the application. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/676/2b0/546/6762b0546a97479bbd5b1264c855f5cb.png" alt="image"></div><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ede/f2b/9c6/edef2b9c6cce474499d7e94c318e86a4.png" alt="image"></div><br>  The first thing that the installer has to do when he gets to the place of work is to take a picture of the scope of work using the application, and using a selfie stick to take a picture of the entire team, which should be dressed for all safety measures. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a3c/260/cc9/a3c260cc99154a6ab7c8d965d003e4d0.png" alt="image"></div><br>  It is also necessary to video the current state of the site.  The team is allowed to work only by completing all these steps and sending photos and videos to the server. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/872/67e/581/87267e581a4c4013a479f365d0848033.png" alt="image"></div><br>  There is one unpleasant nuance. If you do not have time to send data to the server at a certain time, the application simply does not load the data about the object, and the whole procedure will have to be redone. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f21/a4d/090/f21a4d0909bf4047a2ec439442fe6f41.png" alt="image"></div><br>  Each stage of the work should be recorded, referring to the sent tasks.  Low-quality photo server does not accept.  Accordingly, the camera of the smartphone should shoot well, and the lighting should be appropriate. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d14/a55/761/d14a557615b44d6e9ca711390dfa4dae.png" alt="image"></div><br>  One of the employees of the contractor who performed the work on the Huawei tender shared with us our own experience with SmartQC.  In his words, special difficulties arise during high-altitude work.  For the clarity of photos, you need to hold the smartphone with both hands, and all this complicates the already complex work and slows down the process.  At the same time, no one canceled the time frame for completing the task.  Plus, force majeure like a dead smartphone battery is not excluded.  Vendor absolutely do not care. <br><br>  In addition, the installation - work is not binding to have high intelligence.  Often, the final contractor receives relatively little money after each subcontractor bites off his piece.  It is clear that people without education and understanding take the job to do that the smartphone can be used not only to ‚Äúlike‚Äù pictures of girls in social networks.  Therefore, working with SmartQC many enters into a stupor. <br><br>  At the same time, SmartQC has a lot of shortcomings, which has often led to curiosities. <br><br><blockquote>  ‚ÄúMore than once it happened that the installer used a tower for several hours, and when he came down and tried to send a photo, he suddenly found out that none of them was saved,‚Äù said an employee who worked at Huawei sites. </blockquote><br>  By the way, the application made at night does not accept the application, so if the work is finished at night, then you will have to return for the photos during the day.  It often happens that photos that look clear on the phone are processed after a certain time when they hit the server.  As a result, the installer, confident that his photo was taken by the server, leaves the site with a sense of accomplishment.  Later, the computer discards the photo and the employee must return to the object again, otherwise the work will not be credited. <br><br>  A lot of negative moments occur in the interaction of the ligament VimpelCom - Huawei - the Contractor.  In the course of the work, the installer is consulted, but when the work is done the employee is left alone with SmartQC, which often turns out that he simply cannot submit a report to the customer.  People work at a loss, and many give up the job on the ‚Äúhalfway‚Äù without getting a penny.  There are often cases when installers try to return their money by engaging in outright vandalism, taking with them expensive equipment from communication facilities. <br><br>  On the Internet, you can find a lot of examples where people, having taken up the work, at first simply did not understand what they were connected with, and when they understood, they quit their jobs. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/873/dc8/658/873dc86585444ece8723a27d115fac68.png" alt="image"></div><br>  As practice shows, performers who know their own worth are not taken for such works.  As a result, the work goes to performers without appropriate qualifications.  This is followed by a violation of the terms of performance of work, and, consequently - a violation of the agreements and the loss of money. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/373225/">https://habr.com/ru/post/373225/</a></p>
