      The main task for the business in the field of Internet marketing is to ensure an uninterrupted, cost-effective stream of quality calls from potential customers.  Hiring an internet marketer is contrary to this. <br><br>  So what do you need? <br><br>  We need a project manager who will work on achieving the goals and will not depend on technology. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Let's take an example <br><br><h3>  What is the difference between an internet marketer and a project manager? </h3><br><table><tbody><tr><th></th><th>  Internet marketer </th><th>  Project Manager </th></tr><tr><td>  Using a variety of advertising channels and technologies </td><td>  Ineffective.  Uses effectively only those where it understands.  Where does not understand - either refuses, or spoils relations with contractors, or chooses inefficient </td><td>  Highly effective.  Knows the channels are not deep, but can quickly assess the quality of the work of contractors </td></tr><tr><td>  Project management </td><td>  Can not.  Project management skills are rare </td><td>  Primary duty </td></tr><tr><td>  Manage a large number of internal or external contractors </td><td>  95% that fails at multiple sites is a consequence of the paragraph above. </td><td>  Displays the project </td></tr><tr><td>  Achievement of the result </td><td>  <b>Effective only in cases of familiar advertising channels.</b> </td><td>  Always effective </td></tr><tr><td>  Communication within the team </td><td>  Inflated ego, professional slang, inability to build qualitative interaction - with sales departments and others </td><td>  One of the skills in project management is to build efficient work both inside and outside </td></tr><tr><td>  Short term prospects </td><td>  <b>If the advertising channel is still effective and the marketer knows it, it will be effective for a short distance.</b> </td><td>  Slower will give quick results </td></tr><tr><td>  Long-term perspectives </td><td>  The ballast in the company, if the effectiveness of the channel falls or the entry threshold greatly increases </td><td>  Provides long-term results </td></tr></tbody></table><br><cut><br>  Currently, the rate of change, even within advertising channels such as Yandex.Direct or Facebook advertising, is such that only people who specialize in one thing and who always live in it can achieve high efficiency. <br>  But this does not correspond to the interests of the business - it is impossible to start the whole strategy of attracting customers only on one advertising channel.  Already, one can observe a large cemetery of companies that, at the stage of forming a channel, visited it, got a large flow of customers and then died when the advertising channel either increased significantly or the volume of customers fell from there. <br><br>  Any company needs at least 3-5 advertising channels + work on repacking the product on the site and other media + constant analytics.  Internet marketer will be to the fact that he knows, but he usually does not know much. <br>  Look for a project manager yourself - this is a key link in your company.  It will help to find a balance between expenses and advertising revenue and between internal and external contractors. <br><br><h3>  How to choose a project manager? </h3><br>  He must have the following skills: <br><br><ol><li>  Ability to manage projects. <br>  Let him tell right at the interview how he did it, make a plan for a simple project on a piece of paper.  If there is no experience - you risk.  We advise you to learn the basics - spend 2.5 hours on PMBOOK and you will save millions of money on an annualized basis (advertising budgets + sn incorrectly hired employees + lost profits). </li><li>  Ability to negotiate with people. <br>  If PM cannot find a common language with the people in the team - he will achieve little, and you will hear how guilty everyone is. </li><li>  The ability to experiment. <br>  He must be able to hypothesize and count the economy of the project - he should not throw out money for something that will give little benefit to the business, and what he cannot prove with numbers. </li></ol><br><cut><br>  <b>Must have the following knowledge:</b> <br>  1. Knowledge of the main advertising channels <br>  At the level of launch and management - so that he could speak the same language with contractors. <br><br>  2. Knowledge of basic solutions to increase efficiency. <br>  Knowledge of marketing fundamentals (the main carrier of customer knowledge and value creation is PRODUCT CREATOR), which influences the decision to apply to the company (everything from usability and copywriting to PR). <br><br>  3. Knowledge of several, including flexible, project management methodologies. <br>  In theory, at least. <br><br>  What qualities should a candidate have? <br><br>  <b>1. burning eyes</b> <br>  If you do not want to learn new things, you have already lost.  He will not look for new, not overheated advertising channels. <br><br>  <b>2. Resultant</b> <br>  Preserve you from the processor.  You will always improve and cook something.  If a person is not a resultant - all of the above doesn‚Äôt play any role anymore - CHOOSE IT. <br><br>  <b>3. Systems thinking</b> <br>  Project management with a dozen advertising channels, complex analytics, multiple customer and product segments, different LTVs, complex integrations and implementations - if a person is not systematic - he will fill up the project. <br><br>  Find yourself such a person and after that you will close forever the question of attracting customers via the Internet.  He will do the rest for you himself. <br><cut><br><h3>  PS What should a poor internet marketer do? </h3><br>  Understand your position - narrow-mindedness and linking to several advertising channels or even worse superficiality in marketing.  Do serious development of yourself as a project manager. <br><br>  Develop these qualities in yourself and then you will be the best! </cut></cut></cut></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/344264/">https://habr.com/ru/post/344264/</a></p>
