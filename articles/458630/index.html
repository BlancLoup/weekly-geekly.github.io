  <section class="page js-page"><h1>A small history of developing your game on pure Windows Forms + –° # in my 16 years</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><h3>  A little background </h3><br>  I came to the development in the middle of the 8th grade (now finished 9), before I played a lot of games, so I had a great desire to write mine.  And now, after a huge pile of theory and small projects, I got to the first big project.  In general, I am self-taught.  The first serious project was my game about fishing, written in pure <b>Windows Forms + C #</b> .  I‚Äôll say right away that I don‚Äôt see the point of writing a game on a third-party engine, because my path does not lie in Gamedev. <br><br><h3>  Project development </h3><br>  The idea of ‚Äã‚Äãcreation came from a large 2D game ‚ÄúRussian Fishing‚Äù, by the way, I took most of the textures from there, because drawing is not part of my plans.  Surprisingly, due to the large experience on small tasks, Google almost never used it during development.  From which I conclude that solving even simple small tasks gives a big profit. <br><br>  The development itself was not very difficult, but there were places where I sat all day, creating new projects, where I tried to make a part of the program separately, so that I could fasten it into my project.  One of these places is the depth at locations.

      This is a large matrix consisting of Labels, which, using the Pythagorean theorem, process the presence of a mouse next to it.  Now there is an option to remake differently, but I‚Äôm alone, and there‚Äôs still a lot to learn about technologies, because I‚Äôm planning to get a job by the end of the summer =).  (I think it‚Äôs pretty easy to imagine how it looks.) <br><br>  There were problems in the implementation of baits, because each fish eats something of its own, and there are many locations, and even the depth is different.  In general, I spent on bait for almost a week for 6-8 hours.  But now it works :) <br><br>  There were problems in the design of architecture (then I had no idea how it should look like) because of what there were problems with the implementation of some things, and I had to redo the code many times, but it was worth it.  And even now, there are a lot of problems, but it is very interesting. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Screenshots</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/efc/182/6d9/efc1826d9530b8e12c595d782d5465ed.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ud/wk/hd/udwkhd3rj72eyklz6gb-o_dgqfe.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/gc/gb/t6/gcgbt65arrn9d8iyxh6l4whaqti.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ub/gr/4q/ubgr4qfs77ya4smcz8vh34cvz2m.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/fi/un/27/fiun27jvma-q4yh1psiph9iyv1m.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/vc/fg/_q/vcfg_qci2svwr-vmjkxhf3zrvjc.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/w6/rx/r1/w6rxr1stqyemswsmhaji4kmnxls.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/zb/fe/_o/zbfe_ojoikeo1mqev_xetf3st7k.png"><br><br></div></div><br><h3>  A small conclusion, rather even a message to novice developers. </h3><br>  Guys, never give up, write code every day, learn technology despite your age.  It's worth it.  Indeed, in my 16 years I already think about how to get a job as a programmer.  I hope that this post will give someone motivation to learn.  But the main thing - remember that programmers are not born! <br><br>  In the future I will try to write an article about my training, job placement.  But unfortunately, HeadHunter in my city is empty, both C # and java vacancies.  So I will think. <br><br>  Thanks to everyone who read this post to the end, I will attach a link for you to my Google project disc.  I'll be back here stronger! <br><br>  Waiting for questions, advice in comments.  While I‚Äôll be redoing my project, there‚Äôs still a lot of work there and it‚Äôs great. <br><br><h4>  It was: </h4><br>  <a href="https://drive.google.com/open%3Fid%3D1LXPGaTIq3rT-cR-UxK5MyItCEzE1wiWY">Google drive</a> <br><br>  It became (only 2 location) <br><br>  <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-FnagNaPWL0kGTnlEREjqCzPCmXkRYbq/view%3Fusp%3Dsharing">Google drive</a> <br><br>  PS: Thank you, Habr, that you are =) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/458630/">https://habr.com/ru/post/458630/</a></p>
