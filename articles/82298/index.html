And the controversy on the Internet has already flared up in earnest. <br><br>  Half of the users and journalists frankly do not understand why such an absurd device is needed.  Others frankly praise and crave for it, finding unusual use cases for use (someone even wanted to carry it in a bag and chat over the headset).  But, to tell the truth, there are more indignant ones.  And they are easy to understand, because the iPad is a set of compromises. <br><br>  But is not everything so simple?  It could be if it was not Apple.

    <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Thin, but too large in width and height, with a touchscreen display - and a huge frame around the edge.  It weighs 700 grams, but has a resolution like my six-year-old laptop.  It will help you plan your time, but it is so convenient to get it out of your bag each time in order to enter information about a new meeting.  It has multitouch, but not multitasking.  Able to get into the Internet, but can not run Flash.  Movies play - but not all.  Reads books - but works only 10 hours.  And there is not a single connector.  Do you want to stick a card or a flash drive into it?  Sorry, brother, not feng shui.  Do as Stevie said. <br><br>  Characteristics do not amaze the imagination, but rather make you look at the calendar.  Hey, Mr. Jobs, this year is two thousand and ten.  You would have struck the imagination with such a gadget yesterday, but not today. <br><br>  So Eldar Murtazin and Sergei Kuzmin frankly do not understand <a href="http://mobile-review.com/articles/2010/apple-ipad.shtml">who ever needed this device</a> .  With the light hand of Eldar, the term was born - bedside computer. <br><br>  For me, so for the iPad the most successful name is the kitchen computer.  For example, Mr. Smith - in his bag MBP or VAIO.  But he is not a geek, even quite the opposite.  He was offered to buy a device to which the favorite New York Times would come every morning, which he likes to watch over his morning coffee.  In essence, he doesn't care how to read.  But here they promise him comfort, and every morning they don‚Äôt have to go out in slippers and a bathrobe outside.  But his wife, Mrs. Smith, for the morning coffee she reads fresh Cosmo.  And there is advertising new clothes, and advertisements lead directly to the pages of online stores, where you can glamorly stock up without even lifting the priests from a comfortable kitchen chair. <br>  But Mr. Brown likes that he can buy a book anywhere and read it.  so he can do so much.  Obviously better than Kindle, and even if it doesn‚Äôt need it, it will come in handy someday, especially since it‚Äôs not very expensive, and with a contract it‚Äôs a penny.  and he also heard something about the attached clavus.  So this is a real computer from Apple, wow! <br><br>  They do not need Flash, they even do not need the Internet in this form.  They do not need functionality, flash and multitasking, they need content and convenient mechanisms for its delivery.  With which Apple has always been all right. <br><br>  That is why in Russia this device is unlikely to take off, remaining a fetish exclusively for fans of the brand. <br>  And in countries with full-fledged support from iTunes and, above all, on the main Apple market, the North American market, the gadget has every chance of discovering and conquering a new niche of bedside kitchen processors. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/82298/">https://habr.com/ru/post/82298/</a></p>
