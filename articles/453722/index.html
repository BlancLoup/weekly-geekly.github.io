  <section class="page js-page"><h1>On the study of non-stationary processes</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  It is well known that most of the time series that a researcher has to deal with are non-stationary, and their analysis is noticeably more complicated than the study of stationary processes.  Since interest in wavelets seems to have subsided, it is useful to discuss some other "non-stationary" tools, suitable primarily for estimating instantaneous frequencies, as well as for estimating instantaneous spectra. <br><br>  First of all, it makes sense to recall the "analytical signal".  Below, the ‚ÄúAn-model‚Äù is referred to as just finding the instantaneous impedance and power of the test signal after it has been completed with an imaginary part (shifted in phase by œÄ / 2). <br><br>  But it is not always possible to tinker with the Gilbert transform.  Earlier it was already <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/448078"><b>mentioned</b></a> about the autoregressive spectral estimation method, suitable for working with short sequences.  Under the ‚ÄúAR-model‚Äù, here we will mean the study of short (out of 5 samples) overlapping fragments of the original signal in order to determine the autoregression coefficients of the 2nd order, finding the ‚Äúpoles‚Äù of the model, etc.

Further.  ‚ÄúInstantaneous power‚Äù for the An-model is defined in an obvious way, as | y [i] |  <sup>2</sup> , and the issue of scaling this estimate appears to have been exhausted.  For the AR model, the usual technique associated with determining the power of the conventional white noise in the case of a non-stationary signal ‚Äúdoes not work‚Äù.  In the absence of the best ideas, scaling was applied, based on the average square of the corresponding 5 counts.  It seems that nothing more can be done by analyzing only the 5-sample sequence.  In the animation, one can see how the ARM graph of the SPM sometimes ‚Äúperceptibly‚Äù fails relative to the An-score.  It should be understood that the moments of the ‚Äúzero crossing‚Äù for an AR-model can present difficulties not only in terms of errors with an instantaneous frequency, but also with an instantaneous amplitude, especially in the low-frequency region. <br><br>  A few comments at the end. <br><br><ol><li>  According to current experience, both methods usually give good results in evaluating the instantaneous frequency, at least on average (based on the sampling frequency) frequency range. </li><li>  The relatively high quality of the results of the An-method, its simplicity and ease of understanding and implementation are more than compensated for by the possible difficulties with the transformation of the process according to Gilbert.  A good-quality Gilbert digital filter, especially in a wide frequency range, may have an unacceptably high order.  When implementing the alternative periodogram method of this transformation, it is necessary to take into account that the Fourier transform implicitly implies the completion of the process to a periodic one.  As a result, it may be necessary to explicitly complete the process by building zeros.  The high quality of the results of the An-method is explained by its use of information on a very wide area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe selected point in time (strictly speaking - throughout the whole process implementation process), and this property makes it difficult to implement the method (for example, when working in real time). </li><li>  If necessary, the following measures can be recommended to improve the results of the AR method: <br><ul><li>  Data thinning (at an excessively high sampling rate) </li><li>  An increase in the number of averages is an extension of the ‚Äúpoint of time‚Äù neighborhood involved in the model - the construction of the track matrix X with a large number of rows. </li><li>  Increasing the order of the AR-model. </li></ul></li></ol></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/453722/">https://habr.com/ru/post/453722/</a></p>
