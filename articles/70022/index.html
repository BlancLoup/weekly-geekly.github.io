I didn‚Äôt have to go far - one suggested what was ‚Äúin the bins‚Äù, the second was picked up from the new one. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/ac3/744/dd9/ac3744dd9d0a22b64b82f73ef6cf3824.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Under the cut - a little intimate details) <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Once upon a time I had two <b>high</b> - <b>watt</b> power supplies from <b>HIPER</b> - one (at 730W) I <a href="http://www.amdclub.ru/content/view/71/84/">won a</a> long <a href="http://www.amdclub.ru/content/view/71/84/">time</a> in the article competition, the second, at 780W - never remembered where it came from) Given that my ‚Äúworkhorse‚Äù is now the media center , I don't need such power - one BP sold, the second one remained lying.

      It was all at the dawn of my ‚Äúreview description‚Äù - even then I pofotkat the prize somewhere on the table with thoughts ‚Äú <i>there will be free time and some banknotes - I will collect myself a‚Äú fighter ‚Äùand write a reviewer,</i> ‚Äù but it never came to that: ) Although the pictures have remained since that time - no laminate, nothing. <br><br><h2>  Namba van </h2><br>  I already introduced readers to the <b>HIPER</b> products <b>-</b> I <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/hardware/51228/">did a review of the</a> media center, which, by the way, also won on the same site) Even then I noted the caring attitude of the manufacturer to the packaging of a quality product, as well as the pleasant package bundle. <br>  The exception was not and heavy power supply <b><a href="http://www.hipergroup.com/products.php%3Flv%3D3%26cate%3D1%26type%3D7%26pid%3D129%26language%3Dru">HIPER HPU-4M780 780W</a></b> , which was packed in a box in the thickness of the foam material. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/5db/81a/d77/5db81ad77a0d05cc15c92d6b241397b5.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  In addition to the source, there were many instructions inside, an adapter to a foreign outlet, a set of cogs and a pair of braids.  The network wire is interestingly organized - one part of it is screwed together, allowing you to attach the necessary ‚Äútip‚Äù - an unusual, but universal solution! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/2b4/7ce/1c1/2b47ce1c14fff077a13c67565fc38f84.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The body is black, matte, with a huge number of nets - for ventilation. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/95a/9a4/5c3/95a9a45c3308c989ec5db6d1d11c4264.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  On top is a 135mm cooler (1000-1800 rpm). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/4b7/e11/489/4b7e114895186e3250a80a12298f7d82.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  On the back side (which will be visible from the standard case at the back) there is only a mains power connector and a power button. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/399/30d/224/39930d224e03898060585f9b03ef198a.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  On one of the sides there is a table of values ‚Äã‚Äãof currents and voltages, in the ranges of which the power supply unit can safely operate.  In front there is a thick braid for the motherboard and 8 more braids are thinner - for connecting various devices (up to 14 pieces). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/7ba/e57/dbf/7bae57dbfa0a59a006ddddb0f0f5d227.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  A detailed "flaring" with the length of the wires is shown <a href="">here</a> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/bcc/38b/eb3/bcc38beb34ad24c8c005c7ce1d121606.png" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/a0c/ea0/b40/a0cea0b40396a166844dbaf37212bf89.png" alt="image"><br><br>  The younger brother (at 730 W) in the test for 3DNews <a href="http://www.3dnews.ru/power/hiper_m730w">received</a> the best marks.  The power supply is certified for SLI systems.  Price from 4,000 to 5,500 rubles.  Torn from the heart :) <br><br><h2>  Namba Tu </h2><br>  The second friend seems to be more lucky.  He picked up the new <b><a href="http://www.huntkey.com/eng/productmore.asp%3Fid%3D886">Huntkey X7 800</a></b> - 800-watt power supply, belonging to the family of modular.  What does it mean?  This means that all wires (except the ATX Plug) can be disconnected without problems, leaving only the necessary ones. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/ee6/506/8c3/ee65068c3a506458a7ce492beda51e27.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Such an approach will allow a decent "defuse the situation" inside the body, freeing up a lot of space, and often - a positive effect on air circulation. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/1e3/15d/c4a/1e315dc4aaccd54ef3357335bfdb64b4.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Many manufacturers have such models, but, as a rule, such power supply units are either low-power or too expensive.  But everywhere the company's sight is initially felt - players and enthusiasts. <br>  The box, perhaps, will be more interesting first - not ashamed to give such a gift.  Matte black box that opens like a book.  Inside the "book" all the space is divided into two parts - in one of them the power supply lives, in the second - all the wires. <br>  The power supply is black, with a matte rough surface.  On top of the grill is a 140mm cooler.  On the back there is no power button - only the power connector. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/7a5/dea/45a/7a5dea45a39f21b77358e6f70172993e.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  On the front side there are connectors - each has its own unique shape, color and signature.  To confuse something is impossible, but just in case there is an instruction. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/1ea/e8a/526/1eae8a526a68f7655b2c2be410ab430f.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  As for the wires, each is braided, there are markings on the ‚Äúends‚Äù, for which connector.  However, in the Hiper block everything is exactly the same. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/e90/194/13d/e9019413dc586f352f66c3ced419f247.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  On one of the sides there is a sticker with the specifications of the source - it is strange why the manufacturer was afraid to use a table for the data) All parameters are written in a line.  But do we often look at them? <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/910/79b/f39/91079bf39e980708d87a70f91566d132.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Wires are inserted easily, but fasten securely, do not hang out. <br><br><h2>  So what? </h2><br>  I am far from circuitry, so I didn‚Äôt even bother to go inside (and the guarantee would not be superfluous) - I had enough of what I saw in the reviews.  So, whoever is interested, can see these reviews, where full testing was conducted - <a href="http://www.3dnews.ru/power/huntkey_cm800/">one</a> , <a href="http://hard.modnews.ru/view/744/1">two</a> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/313/685/147/313685147ecc33fc917ca8d25757ef42.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  I just managed to check the device for performance, simultaneously assessing the noise level.  Subjectively, Hiper is quieter, but both units are quieter than my power supply [200W with two coolers in the media center - it seems it's time to update the lubricant :)].  Because silence should be in the library ... <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/ab6/bc7/c5e/ab6bc7c5e8248de12d1cac07d03e33c4.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/505/bef/615/505bef6157a7c67721f8353685b014a6.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  I want to pay attention to the next moment.  Both power supply units do not indulge the owner with a diode backlight when working (which, you have to admit, look beautifully through each time) - this, IMHO, says even more that the manufacturer is not trying to take the user in "ryushechkami."  Such real power supplies, serious, with honest watts - are intended for players who collect productive configurations and for enthusiasts for whom diet food plays a significant role.  This power is more than enough even for the most vigorous configuration.  At the same time, power supplies are quite affordable - 5,000 rubles each, except that Huntkey is still somewhat difficult to get, it just appeared. <br><br>  In the reviews, by the results of the tests, by the way, both blocks received the highest scores.  The friends managed to adapt both sources - according to them, everything works at the proper level and there is almost no noise from the power supply in the cases - only from the CPU coolers and video.  Although, something tells me that any non-noname power supply unit of this price category for an inexperienced user would prove to be the same - but I am pleased, like helped).  In the near future I will demand from them assistance in testing a pair of game devices - it <a href="">will be</a> interesting, do not switch!  :) <br><br>  <b>Successes!</b> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/70022/">https://habr.com/ru/post/70022/</a></p>
