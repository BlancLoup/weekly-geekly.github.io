  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Apoi.ru application for Android</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  We are pleased to present for discussion an updated version of the application <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details%3Fid%3Dru.apoi.gui">Apoi.ru for Android</a> . <br><br>  The clear advantage of this application is not only the ability to search for interesting places based on the user's location, but also the unique convergence of the application and the resource of the same name <a href="http://www.apoi.ru/">www.apoi.ru</a> <br><br>  What is the convergence? <a name="habracut"></a>  In a simple and logical system for transferring data from the pages of the site to the mobile application.  We did not bother with the use of ultra-modern methods of data transmission via Bluetooth, recognition of the device by the NFC chip and other tricky technologies.  We simply placed QR codes on our website.  And the information encrypted in each of them is quite enough to determine the resource and the page being viewed.  The application has a built-in system for reading such codes, which allows you to instantly display the information presented on the website on the device screen.  As one of our users wrote: ‚ÄúImmediately I remembered the Avatar movie :-) (plot in the laboratory).  Understand why we need these strange pictures with dots.  Well done!  Very comfortably!"

      It seems to us that we found this moment: <br><br><iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/H6QieoX1RDI%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700022,15700186,15700190,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhhSkVCZOT8ySMzVGBI-_ewk-Cw4AQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  Naturally, QR code can be read not only from our application, but also with the help of dozens of others.  In this case, the page from which the code is read will open in a normal, mobile browser. <br><br>  What else is convenient in our application is to leave feedback.  Suppose you came to a restaurant, ordered a perfectly smelling and perfectly roasted steak or any other edible food.  And suddenly you find that there is an extra ingredient in the side dish, for example a piece of colored plastic, a waiter's tooth, a dragon's eye, or other troubles.  All that you need to do in order to warn the rest of the visitors of this institution, it is emotionally convey your impressions of the event.  How can I do that?  It's very simple: in the application, you can leave not only written reviews, typing them using the software keyboard, but also dictating a review with instant text display (the function is protected in the keyboard from Google).  Or just record your emotional experiences in a sound file, make a confirming photo and send feedback to the server.  As a result, the site will contain not only the text of the review, a photo, but also a sound file with sincere feelings that accompanied you at that moment. <br><br>  We thought for a long time what to do with the cards and decided that perhaps the most relevant (in terms of traffic jams) are well-known <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details%3Fid%3Dru.yandex.yandexmaps%26feature%3Dsearch_result">Yandex.cards</a> .  As a result, if this program is installed on the user's device, then all points are displayed in it.  A route to the desired organization is carried out taking into account traffic jams.  It‚Äôs a pity that the telecom operators have stopped providing free access to them at the moment.  Half a year ago, this was a huge advantage over Google‚Äôs maps.  If the program is not installed, then the points are displayed on a map from Google.  And despite the fact that everyone says that the Google Maps API is better, we did not find any advantages (or didn‚Äôt want to look for them). <br><br>  For the convenience of users, the ‚ÄúMy‚Äù tab was implemented, where the last organizations viewed by the user are located.  Why search for the place you like for a long time?  And if you need to gather friends or colleagues in this place, you can send a message directly from the company‚Äôs card with the organization‚Äôs address and phone number, or a short link to the organization‚Äôs card on the <a href="http://www.apoi.ru/">apoi.ru</a> website. <br><br>  Naturally, in the application you can add new organizations, their photos, call the phone numbers indicated on the card, go to the desired site, send an e-mail, read the description or reviews.  But since these are the functions that almost any similar application has, we prefer not to focus on them. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/149332/">https://habr.com/ru/post/149332/</a></p>
