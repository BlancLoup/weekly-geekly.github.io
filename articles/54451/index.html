  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Startup Idea: Virtual Business Network</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Colleagues, I would like to hear your thoughts about the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãa virtual business network. <br><br><h4>  Instead of intro </h4><br>  The development and popularity of social networks has led developers and businessmen to think about using the principles of social networking in business.  Here and there, you can hear ‚Äúbusiness goes social‚Äù, ‚Äúentreprise 2.0‚Äù and the like.  We reviewed the innovations offered by the developers of such services and came to the conclusion that all innovations are limited to the addition of communicative tools of social networks in business applications.  However, we did not meet the service or even the call for the creation of business networks like the creation of social networks: my company ‚Äî my partners ‚Äî partners of my partners, my clients ‚Äî all in one place, everything is formalized and systematized. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h4>  Our vision </h4><br>  In our understanding, such a social business network can be an information and communication slice of the existing market, bringing together participants by occupation, partners, customers, and also provide them with communication, interaction tools, business process management services.  It turns out some kind of virtual business environment in which the interaction between business agents. <br>  It seems to us as a <b>Virtual Business Network (VBN)</b> - a service that allows you to combine many enterprises in a single information ecosystem.  On the one hand, the VBN service is designed to optimize management functions, business processes and interaction schemes in the external and internal environment of the organization, provide the basic communication needs of enterprises for inter-organizational interaction (search for partners, customers, change tracking, information sharing, etc.)  On the other hand, VBN is a suitable platform for deploying third-party SaaS applications on it, thus satisfying the users' need for business tools and the need of software solution providers in the audience.

    <h4>  Opportunities </h4><br><br><h5>  Building partnerships </h5><br>  Any company in the network is described in detail and classified according to its type of activity, capabilities, competencies and other parameters.  Based on this information, the system allows you to optimize work on finding counterparties and building relationships with them. <br><br><h5>  Inter-organization project management </h5><br>  Built-in project management services allow you to build a chain of business processes that are performed by not only your own employees, but also attracted specialists, work groups and entire companies.  This is achieved through a clear definition of the set of competencies of employees, teams, companies;  free access to this information, as well as the built-in rating system of network elements.  The rating of employees and companies is based on their assessment based on the results of business processes.  For example, the execution of any project, process allows the customer to evaluate the work of the contractor according to certain parameters.  Thus, ratings of individual specialists can be compiled, on the basis of which ratings of individual working teams and companies as a whole can be formed. <br><br><h5>  Communication visualization </h5><br>  The visualization technologies of the business network allow you to look at the work of the company as a whole from several perspectives (the position of your company is centered along the axes by average values): <br><ul><li>  partner network (0u: company size, 0x: communication strength) </li><li>  customer network (0y: turnover, 0x: return on sales) </li><li>  business process network (functional network) (communication with counterparties - through functions (IT, Finance, ...)) </li></ul><br>  Visualization tools allow not only to present a complete picture of the company's activities, but also to analyze the strength and effectiveness of business connections throughout the entire field of the company's activities. <br><br><h5>  VBN as a platform </h5><br>  By placing other Saas applications on the basis of VBN, companies can manage individual business processes, such as finance, accounting, HR, etc. <br><br>  I can not say that our vision is clear, but in general, something like that.  I'd love to hear the opinion of people whose ‚Äúeyes are not zamylen‚Äù </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/54451/">https://habr.com/ru/post/54451/</a></p>
