There is money here (especially at the start-ups), but there is no time. <br><br>  <b>UPDATE 2017-03-19</b> : According to the experience of two friends from Berlin (from Russia and Costa Rica), I can reassure you, you may not be given a blue card at first, but after six months you can give it directly in Germany.  The Germans are people too and their officials also know how to sincerely err, and deliberately abut. <br><br>  <b>UPDATE 2017-01-08</b> : a year later I had the experience of finding and hiring front-tenders for two companies.  I declare that a good candidate who has signed the contract is ready to wait a month or two.  I was one medium-sized startup agreed to wait 4 months after an in-person interview.  So, call yourself to be shown, and then start remotely, and after a couple of months, get over - in general, chocolate.

      <b>UPDATE 2016-09-02</b> : half a year later, the lower <b>salary level</b> for the blue card has <b>grown</b> a little, and the rest is still valid. <br><br>  <b>UPDATE</b> : at the request of <a href="https://habr.com/users/chilicoder/" class="user_link">chilicoder I</a> add a remark: ‚Äúthe author was able to move and find a job even without a recognized diploma‚Äù. <br><br>  In search of work abroad, there is a quantum confusion between the offer and the visa.  To get a visa you must have an offer, and to get an offer you should have a visa.  Unravel them, giving a sufficient impulse to the fulcrum. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  Lively bathert </h2><br>  How not to look for work: <br><ol><li>  Bleed a character on a githaba and sit waiting for an offer from Google. </li><li>  A few years to sit tehnoblog with their unique experience. </li><li>  Make a detailed summary and sit send hundreds of companies. </li><li>  Learn English and sit on the cursor. </li><li>  Get into an international JSC "Index" and sit waiting for the transfer. </li><li>  Solder the startups and sit to wait while they call. </li><li>  Sit on Habr√© and read articles, as someone found a job. </li></ol><br>  The key word, as it is easy to notice, is ‚Äúto sit‚Äù.  This is exactly what is not necessary.  We, programmers, generally master of sports on the seat, any trucker will be terrified by the strength of our backs.  Of course, it is very possible to do everything else from the list, but be careful that it does not cause self-adhesive ass syndrome. <br><br><h2>  Let's hit the road </h2><br>  On the example of Germany for a programmer <a href="http://careers.stackoverflow.com/jobs%3Flocation%3DMunich%26range%3D100%26distanceUnits%3DKm">,</a> <a href="http://careers.stackoverflow.com/jobs%3Flocation%3Dberlin%26range%3D20%26distanceUnits%3DKm">there is</a> <a href="http://careers.stackoverflow.com/jobs%3Flocation%3DMunich%26range%3D100%26distanceUnits%3DKm">work</a> <a href="http://careers.stackoverflow.com/jobs%3Flocation%3Dhamburg%26range%3D100%26distanceUnits%3DKm">in</a> <a href="http://careers.stackoverflow.com/jobs%3Flocation%3DFrankfurt%26range%3D100%26distanceUnits%3DKm">abundance</a> in large cities.  In smaller towns, it is also there, but it is smaller, but there they pay extra for living in the village.  Choose a location to your taste, get a regular Schengen visa and pack your bags.  On airbnb, find a modest low-cost room near the center with a female mistress; this will save you from a smoky apartment and neighbors from third world countries. <br><br>  Upon arrival, buy a local sim card and write its number in your resume.  Address also indicate the room in which you live.  Why so sharp?  Paragraph above, we still sat comfortably at home, whining with the mouse, and now we pretend to be local in a foreign country.  And because the interview will be scheduled for you tomorrow afternoon, as sensible programmers are snapped up (even more relevant as of April 2018), and the British Euchar will call by phone.  And you'd better say: ‚ÄúI will be on time.  Yes, this is my mobile. ‚Äù  The fact is that it is more convenient for people to call local mobile numbers and see their home addresses.  So you become clearer, and therefore safer.  A decent address will only strengthen your image of a solid person.  Well, and no Skype will not replace live chat with a well-dressed and pleasantly smelling intellectual.  Do not forget to release the beard in advance and visit the barbershop. <br><br>  Then you go to five to ten interviews a week and get a couple of tempting offers.  If everything suits you, then you should wait for the contract to be signed, walking through the cozy streets with cafes in the evenings so that you can have the original on hand to get a visa at the consulate at home. <br><br><h2>  Visa </h2><br>  Checkpoint successful visa, the example of Germany, look like this. <br><br>  For a regular national visa: <br><ol><li>  The contract; </li><li>  Permit to work for a foreigner (makes a company); </li><li>  Fight with consulate bureaucracy; </li><li>  National visa for 3 months (with annual renewal); </li><li>  Relocation and struggle with the local bureaucracy; </li><li>  Six months probation; </li><li>  Profit: work. </li></ol><br>  For the blue card: <br><ol><li>  Contract&gt; = 52.000 euros per year; </li><li>  Diploma of higher technical education of a decent university; </li><li>  Or any higher education + five years of work in white firms with employment records; </li><li>  Fight with consulate bureaucracy; </li><li>  National visa for 3 months; </li><li>  Relocation and struggle with the local bureaucracy; </li><li>  Blue card for up to 4 years; </li><li>  Six months probation; </li><li>  Profit: a decent salary and residence permit. </li></ol><br>  Obviously, the path with a national visa is simpler, but little depends on you in it, and the most delicious things are given out only with a blue card.  Common to both of these ways: aikido with a diverse bureaucracy. <br><br><h2>  Fight against bureaucracy </h2><br>  This combat discipline looks like this.  It is necessary to sign up for distant numbers in different institutions, bring a lot of translated and certified documents, the lists of which will have to be confirmed by phone, answering once a week in the morning (rightly, both before and after the move, the bureaucracy knows no boundaries).  On-site (except for a small part of England) they speak English worse than Russian.  That is, without a talking buddy, there is nothing to do with bureaucrats, they can go on to the principle.  The Germans advise you to start a dialogue in German with some learned phrases, and then, as if in despair, ask about English.  Papers in a foreign language must be collected on time and in the correct order, and here knowledge of German will not help: there are many German languages, and one of them is German postal, which bureaucrats love.  And also, specifically in Germany, there is a problem of chicken and eggs: you cannot get a residence permit without a bank account, and a bank account does not have a residence permit, but if you ask in advance to send yourself a letter from Germany, then some banks may accept such an envelope as confirmation of postal addresses (Germans obsessed with paper mail).  From 2017, you can open an account in the bank <a href="https://n26.com/en-de/">N26</a> on the passport and do not bathe. <br><br>  This process must be constantly monitored, and the error can cost you and visas, and the offer, and all the time spent searching for work.  My experience began exactly this way, with nerves, a bunch of entries in the calendar, early trips to the limits of where, and in the end I did end up in endless recursion with registration ‚Üí account ‚Üí registration.  Bottom line: refer <a href="https://www.facebook.com/Prodevart-333839596704491/">to the recloker</a> , he has all the knowledge and connections to do his job smoothly and on time. <br><br><h2>  Unraveling </h2><br>  So, it's time for the most pulp.  You are imbued with the understanding that the work is better and faster to search on the spot.  Once again, we remembered that our brother needed to invest time and money in a visa.  Now it's the turn of the little trick that unravels the visa and the offer. <br><br>  You must first obtain a visa and it must be a blue card, since it only allows you to change the employer without obtaining special permission from the employment service.  If you boldly say at the interview that you have a blue card, you will be able to see Hachar‚Äôs contented smile and in a couple of weeks you will be released to a new job.  Of course, you can restrict yourself to a subject, and just go to another country in search of work.  This is already +100500 to your chances of finding a normal job in the eurozone.  But it is better to go all the way and fix yourself a blue card, which in combination is also Schengen, and a residence permit with a pension and honey.  insurance. <br><br>  And how to make a blue card?  It‚Äôs very simple: you need to find a springboard company (relocater tells you) ready to show a salary of about 52,000 euros a year gross (2100 per hand per month, which is very, very good) and apply boldly on a blue card.  Having received a national visa, work for three months, regularly paying taxes.  Then pick up the finished card and look for a normal job with a clear conscience.  Even immediately resigning, you will receive a minimum of 3 months to find a new job.  The next job should also be found for a salary of at least the level of the blue card, but this is much easier with a visa, a smile and confidence in the eyes. <br><br><h2>  Total </h2><br>  In principle, much of this has already been described in parts, but the whole picture was managed to be put together only in practice, quite by accident.  If you like the article, I can invite to the comments a live reocater who saved my skin for the first months. <br><br><h2>  see also </h2><br>  On the Megamind there is a most interesting volume article on the same topic: " <a href="https://megamozg.ru/post/23232/">The experience of moving to work as a programmer in Berlin</a> ."  It is distinguished by the fact that the author has a diploma of a technical university recognized in Germany, 8,000 euros in reserve, 4 months of unpaid leave and the power to bar out bureaucrats.  I did not have this.  And in the end, the author also changes the first job in six months, which is symbolic. <br><br>  There is another excellent article that inspired the author of ‚ÄúThe Experience of Moving‚Äù above: ‚Äú <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/273673/">Moving an IT person to Germany: from A to Z</a> ‚Äù.  It is also voluminous and should also be re-read several times, until all the small parts are added together. <br><br>  And, of course, Her Majesty " <a href="http://tupa-germania.ru/">Tupa Germany</a> ".  Selected: <a href="http://www.tupa-germania.ru/immigratsiya/golubaja-karta-es-v-germanii.html">Blue card</a> , <a href="http://www.tupa-germania.ru/immigratsiya/kak-perevezti-semju-v-germaniju.html">family transport</a> . <br><br>  Get inspired! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/298270/">https://habr.com/ru/post/298270/</a></p>
