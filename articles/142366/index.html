The closed testing stage is completed, and you are ready to present your brainchild to the world.  For some time, the main commercial medium of your project may be a promotional video.  It can be put on YouTube and social networks, sent to partners and investors, placed on the home page of the site, accompanied by a press release for the media or revitalized the presentation at the conference. <br><br>  The purpose of the promotional video: briefly and clearly tell about the essence and value of the project, to interest the target audience and encourage to become a user.

      How to make a good movie, which will see through to the end?  How to make the video a smile, interest, desire to get acquainted with the project closer?  There are no universal recipes, but there are well-established plot schemes, as well as a rake, which have already been attacked many times before. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  In this article I will give a small overview of the promotional videos of startups, on the example of which I will demonstrate typical mistakes, note the key advantages of good clips, and acquaint readers with the conclusions reached as a result of the analysis. <br><br>  I did this analysis for myself about a year ago, when I was puzzled by the production of a promotional video for my project.  The project is frozen, the movie has not been completed yet.  Let at least this little research will serve my karma and those Habr readers who are just about to promote their project. <br><br><h1>  Problem-Solution Scenario </h1><br>  ‚ÄúProblem-solution‚Äù is one of the main scenarios of promotional videos.  Already from the name its logic is clear: in the first part of the video some kind of problem is indicated, in the second part of the video it is described how it can be solved with the help of the service.  Very often, some hero is introduced into the plot of the video ‚ÄúProblem-solution‚Äù to make it easier for the viewer to try the problem on himself. <br><br>  The main issue that needs to be solved in the production of rollers on this subject is timing.  How long to talk about the problem?  How to tell about a difficult problem quickly?  When is the first time to insert a screensaver with the project logo? <br><br>  But let's see something. <br><br><h3>  Yelp </h3><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/Dqi-jjbEKcs&amp;xid=17259,1500000,15700022,15700186,15700190,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhhQ5W-ks1aSA8JruNAeby8ytT_GVw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  Duration already suggests that the roller is not all right.  The audience can be tormented for three and a half minutes, only if the video is funny and beautiful. <br><br>  A problem is described for the first 30 seconds.  Jeremy does not deal with the diversity of offers in the market. <br><br>  0:26 A logo appears, but the problem Jeremy continues to suck another 30 seconds.  Immediately, we note the terrible voiceovers: the announcer speaks very quickly.  Over the text clearly did not work. <br><br>  1:00 We tell how everything works.  Many times we mention about some kind of magic filter.  So far without specifics. <br><br>  1:35 Judging by the timing, the video was made by robots, cutting a simple plot into pieces of 30 seconds.  Again the splash screen with the logo.  Again we explain how everything works, but in more detail.  We describe the profile of the referee.  We describe the company profile.  We show how the profiles of companies and referees are related.  This scheme does not deserve to talk about it for a minute. <br><br>  2:30 Repeat, repeat, repeat <br><br><h5>  Conclusion </h5><br>  Long, boring, not beautiful.  The announcer is in a hurry.  The music is so inexpressive and quiet that it is more likely perceived as some kind of extraneous noise.  Not the best example.  However, the fact that the movie was made weakly does not mean that such a scenario is not acceptable.  Next we look at more decent samples of this genre. <br><br><h3>  Loopt </h3><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/TLoeELnC3Qk%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,1500000,15700022,15700186,15700190,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhi-XK8jYvooX6u6Zu3YZodHLPyjbw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  This example was included in the review only to show that even a small duration does not compensate for the savings in musical design and the negligence of the visual series.  This one and a half minute video is also unbearably difficult to watch to the end, like the previous one for 3.5 minutes. <br><br><h3>  Google advisor </h3><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/XBicXcJkra4%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,1500000,15700022,15700186,15700190,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhgc9nhVR7oEoAJT5BueiIrscl5i0A" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  We start with the essence.  Immediately tell what Advisor can do. <br><br>  0:10 We briefly describe the problem with an example: a lot of information around, we spend a lot of time.  Summing up: Advisor will solve this problem in seconds.  In 15 seconds they explained to us how useful the service is. <br><br>  0:30 Enter the site address.  Show the input of url-addresses in the line is very simple, but very effective method to increase the conversion from the video.  We show the interface.  We describe the functional: types of services.  Again, 15 seconds is enough for the initial immersion in the site. <br><br>  0:45 We dive deeper by the example of one service.  No hand drawn graphics.  Google is so proud of its interface that it actually built a screencast into a movie.  And, really, everything can be seen and understood.  The video demonstrates, on the one hand, ease of use, on the other - a wealth of settings, which is important for an area like finance. <br><br>  1:10 Final chords.  ‚ÄúAdvisor is easy.  An advisor saves you money and time. ‚Äù  For some reason I do not want to argue. <br><br><h5>  Conclusion </h5><br>  Perfectly adjusted on the timing plot.  Cleverly found a balance between simplicity and variety of possibilities.  An excellent sample of the problem-solution genre. <br><br>  Compare the quality of the voice of this and the first video.  Feel the difference.  Which service solves problems more efficiently: one that is in a hurry for a long time, or one that is not in a hurry quickly? <br><br>  Compare the level of graphics.  Receptions alone, the style is different.  At Yelp drawn simply and wretchedly.  Google is simple and tasteful. <br><br><h3>  I'mOK </h3><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/tcXL6YfOceM%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,1500000,15700022,15700186,15700190,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhh0DrcjCgjQArNn-9SbBOwWXiIw2Q" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  After the example of the Internet giant, it is interesting to see how a small startup managed the task. <br><br>  The problem description takes the first 35 seconds. <br><br>  0:35 Screensaver with a logo.  We describe the essence in one sentence.  Immediately reassure respectable Americans about privacy.  Do not forget the buzzword location based.  Find out where your kids are.  Just like Foursquare, but how to make kids check in? <br><br>  0:50 We reach the main feature of the service, we tell about the buns that kids get in compensation for total control over their lives. <br><br>  1:18 ‚ÄúHey, where are my buns?‚Äù Mommy is upset.  Mamashka, and you are not gone nuts?  We have come up with such a service!  Mamashka shuts up and starts to smile.  Apparently, this argument should act in the same way on the audience.  Personally, I smiled.  If the video causes a smile, this is a big plus. <br><br><h5>  Conclusion </h5><br>  Mighty video with an obvious hit in the target audience.  Leaves no questions after viewing.  I just missed some carefree music, like in the next video. <br><br><h3>  Onavo </h3><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/GQYbCPfnQys%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,1500000,15700022,15700186,15700190,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhiX0DxqJD7nCo9j-kz0CDutdybACg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  There is no familiar voiceover, and, therefore, a double load falls on the text and graphics.  Well, let's see what the authors of the video compensated for. <br><br>  For the first 30 seconds, describe the problem.  Many small dialog boxes show the eternal problem with the Internet on the go.  The text in the dialog boxes is on the verge of readability, but the situation is so familiar that it does not interfere much. <br><br>  0:38 Screensaver with a logo.  The essence of the service in one sentence: "Onavo optimizes mobile traffic."  The advantage of one sentence: "Onavo saves your money."  The argument is one sentence: "Onavo doubles (or even three!) Times the possibilities of your tariff plan."  As if not enough voiceover.  However, at that moment, when the inscriptions begin to tire, they end.  One more thing - and there would be a lot. <br><br>  0:53 We show that using the service is very simple: you need to press one button.  We turn the same story with a happy ending. <br><br>  1:18 In the end, we show a couple of buns so that they do not think that the service is as simple as two kopecks. <br><br><h5>  Conclusion </h5><br>  The script of the video does not strike the imagination with plot twists and turns, but completely solves the set task.  Slow storytelling is rather a plus than a minus in this situation.  Everything in this video indicates the carefree life of users of the application. <br><br>  Most likely, the voiceover is not needed here, but then you need to be more attentive to design and typography.  In many places the text is on the verge of readability.  Only measured rhythm of the roller saves the situation. <br><br><h3>  Levelup </h3><br><iframe src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=http://player.vimeo.com/21169060&amp;xid=17259,1500000,15700022,15700186,15700190,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhhm3BkHOT2RChtmQV6nXDtrscFzFQ" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" title="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  As I said above, if the video is more than 2 minutes, this causes suspicion.  Most likely there is a lot of water.  So it turned out in this case. <br><br>  Description of the problem.  You make discounts - customers buy and do not return.  This simple thought is explained to us for 52 seconds.  Bad start. <br>  0:52 Screensaver with logo.  The essence of the service is rather vague expressions. <br>  1:02 How it works.  Again we repeat the problem. <br>  1.31 rewind back.  Repeat, repeat, repeat. <br>  1.58 "Maybe he will even bring friends!" Fantastic! <br><br><h5>  Conclusion </h5><br>  Wow  2.5 minutes and no specifics!  The guys have tried.  It always happens when there is nothing to say. <br><br><h3>  Textingly </h3><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/aTkEkt5yIH4%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,1500000,15700022,15700186,15700190,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhg5oQTQ7mipMnNvLdLLGIrmLyJ2Ug" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  Finish on a positive, without going into the details of the last video.  This is a classic representative of the genre, and I think you have already understood its basic techniques. <br><br>  Here I would just like to mention a brilliant musical decision.  Count how many times in the video the melody changed the rhythm and mood.  Please note that the melody changed exactly where it should be. <br><br>  The task is exceeded: I want to revise the video.  And this is largely due to high-quality sound and graphics. <br><br><h3>  General conclusions </h3><br><ol><li>  The problem-solution scenario is used for services that solve a specific and unambiguous task, i.e.  the problem can be described simply enough in two words. </li><li> Problem-Solver rollers are usually strictly classical timekeeping of 1.5 minutes, where the first 30 seconds are described by the problem: ImOK, Textingly, Loopt, Onavo, Google Advisor </li><li>  If the video is longer than 2 minutes, then most likely it is tightened: Yelp, LevelUp. </li><li>  Unprofessional work with graphics and dubbing makes boring even a short video: Loopt </li><li>  You can save on the speaker, if you work hard on the graphics and typography: Textingly </li><li>  The video leaves the best impression if they use a competent balance of graphics, text, voice-over and cheerful music: Onavo, Google Advisor </li></ol><br><br>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/142588/">How to make a good promotional video for a startup.</a>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/142588/">Part 2.
