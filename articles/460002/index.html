  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How we created the Dream Service Desk</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Sometimes you can hear the phrase "the older the product, the more functional it is."  In the age of modern technology, a far-reaching web and SaaS models, this statement almost does not work.  The key to successful development is constant monitoring of the market, tracking requests and requirements of customers, the willingness today to hear an important remark, in the evening to drag it into backlog, and start developing it tomorrow.  That is how we work on the HubEx project - the equipment service management system.  We have an excellent and diverse team of engineers, and we could develop a dating service, an exciting mobile game, a time management system, or the most convenient todo list in the world.  These products would quickly shoot on the market, and we could rest on our laurels.  But our team, people from the engineering company, knows the sphere, where there is a lot of pain, problems and difficulties - this is service.  We think that every one of you experienced a part of these pains.  So, you need to go where they are waiting for us.  Well, we hope that they are waiting :-) <br><br> <a href="https://habr.com/ru/company/hubex/blog/460002/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/o9/qa/b7/o9qab7hcof-8qujqgbaipvq2-k4.jpeg" alt="image"></a> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  <font color="#ed1940">Equipment service: chaos, disorder, downtime</font> </h2><br>  Equipment maintenance for the majority is service centers, where phones are saved from meeting with asphalt and puddle, and laptops - from tea and juice.  But we are on Habr√©, and there are those who serve all types of equipment: <br><br><ul><li>  these same service centers that repair electronics and household appliances; <br></li><li>  centers and outsourcers for servicing printers and printing equipment are a separate and very serious industry; <br></li><li>  multifunctional outsourcers - companies that are engaged in the maintenance, repair and rental of office equipment, electronics and so on.  for office needs; <br></li><li>  companies providing service maintenance of industrial equipment, machines, components and assemblies; <br></li><li>  business centers, management companies and their operating services; <br></li><li>  operation services at various large industrial and social facilities; <br></li><li>  Internal business units that service equipment in the company, repair and support internal business users. <br></li></ul><br>  These listed categories work in different ways, and they all know that there is an ideal scheme: incident - ticket - work - handover, acceptance of work - closed ticket - KPI - bonus (payment).  But most often this chain looks like this: AAAAA!  - What?  - Breakage!  - What?  - We can not work, this simple is your fault!  Urgently!  Important!  - Pancake.  We work.  - What is the repair status?  And now?  - Done, close the ticket.  - Oh thank you.  - Close the ticket.  - And yes, I forgot.  - Close the ticket.

    <hr>  <b>Tired of reading, I want to test with my hands, use and criticize your service!</b>  <b>If so, <a href="https://hubex.ru/">register in Hubeh</a> and we are ready to work with you.</b> <br><hr><br>  Why it happens? <br><br><ul><li>  There is no equipment maintenance strategy - each case is considered haphazardly, it takes time as unique, while so many tasks can be unified, summed up under the intracorporate standard. <br></li><li>  No operational risk assessment.  Alas, many of the company's actions are taken after the fact, when repair is already needed, and at worst, recycling.  In addition, companies often forget to take into account that inside technical assets there must always be a replacement fund - yes, these are superfluous objects in accounting, but the costs for their purchase and maintenance may be significantly lower than losses from possible downtime in operating or production activities. <br></li><li>  There is no equipment management planning.  The technical risk management plan is an essential aspect of working with equipment.  You need to know for sure: maintenance time, inventory time and routine inspection, monitoring status, which serve as triggers for making decisions about additional actions with equipment, etc. <br></li><li>  The companies do not keep records of equipment, do not track the order of operation: the date of entry can be traced only by finding old documents, the history of maintenance and repair is not recorded, there are no lists of wear and tear and the need for spare parts and components. <br></li></ul><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/148/031/3f1/1480313f1407e484f7878f763578f3d4.png"><br>  <i><a href="https://amsrus.ru/">Source of</a></i>  <i><font color="#999999">Garage Brothers do not use HubEx.</font></i>  <i><font color="#999999">And in vain!</font></i> <br><br><h2>  <font color="#ed1940">What did we want to accomplish by creating HubEx?</font> </h2><br>  Of course, we now do not undertake to assert that we have created software that had not existed before.  There are many systems for managing equipment maintenance, Service Desk, industry-specific ERP, etc.  We have repeatedly encountered similar software, but we did not like it: the interface, the lack of a client panel, the mobile version, the use of an outdated stack and expensive DBMS.  And when the developer does not like something very much, he will certainly create his own.  The product itself came out of a real large engineering company, i.e.  we ourselves are none other than the representatives of the market.  Therefore, we know exactly the pains of service and warranty service and take them into account when developing each new product function for all business sectors. <br><br>  While we are at the stage of technological startup, and actively continue to develop and develop the product, but now users of HubEx can get a convenient and functional tool.  But we will not give up criticism too - after that we came to Habr. <br><br>  There are additional important tasks that HubEx can solve. <br><br><ul><li>  Prevent problems, not solve them.  The software keeps records of all equipment, facts of repair and maintenance, and so on.  The entity ‚ÄúApplication‚Äù can be configured for both outsourcers and internal technical services - you can create any stages and statuses, thanks to which you will always know exactly what state each object is in. <br></li><li>  To establish contact between the customer and the contractor - thanks to the message system, as well as the customer interface in HubEx, you no longer need to write hundreds of letters and answer calls, the most detailed information in the system interface. <br></li><li>  Supervise the process of repair and service: plan, assign preventive actions, notify customers to prevent problems.  (Remember how cool it is at the dentists and car centers: at some point you are reminded of another prof. Examination or technical examination - if you want, you do not want it, but you will think).  By the way, in the near future we plan to integrate HubEx with popular CRM systems, which will provide an impressive increase in opportunities for developing relations with customers and increasing the amount of service. <br></li><li>  Lead analytics, which can form the basis for making new business decisions and KPI for employee bonuses.  You can group applications by status and stages, and then based on the ratio of groups for each engineer, master or department, calculate KPIs, and also adjust the work of the company as a whole: rotate employees, conduct training, etc.  (Conventionally, if master Ivanov had most of the applications frozen at the ‚Äútroubleshooting‚Äù stage, he was probably confronted with unfamiliar equipment, which requires a long study of instructions. Training is needed.) <br></li></ul><br><h2>  <font color="#ed1940">HubEx: First Review</font> </h2><br><h4>  <font color="#ed1940">Gallop interface</font> </h4><br>  The main advantage of our system is the designer.  In fact, we can customize the platform for each individual client under his clear objectives and it will not be repeated.  In general, platform is practically a new reality for corporate software: a client gets a fully customized version for the cost of renting a regular solution without scaling, configuration and management problems. <br><br>  Another advantage - setting the life cycle of the application.  In a few clicks, each company can adjust the stages and status of applications for each type of application, which will lead to the structuring of information and the generation of detailed reporting.  Flexible platform settings give +100 convenience, speed and, most importantly, transparency of actions and processes. <br>  Inside HubEx, the company can actually create an electronic passport of the equipment.  You can attach any documentation to your passport, be it a file, a video, a picture, and so on.  There you can also specify the warranty period and apply the FAQ with frequent problems that can be solved by the equipment owners themselves: this will increase loyalty and reduce the number of calls to the service, which means it will free up time for quality solutions to more complex tasks. <br><br>  To get acquainted with HubEx, it is best to leave a request on the site - we will be happy to process each one and help you figure it out if necessary.  ‚ÄúTo feel‚Äù him live is quite nice and interesting from the point of view of software structure: user interface, administrator interface, mobile version.  But if it is more convenient for you to read, we have prepared for you a brief overview of the main entities and mechanisms. <br><br><blockquote>  Well, if there is no time to read at all, meet HubEx, watch a compact and dynamic video about us: <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/SzaRsb_xRX8" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></blockquote>  By the way, it is easy to upload your data to the system: if you did your business in an Excel spreadsheet or somewhere else, then you can easily transfer them to HubEx before you start working in the system.  To do this, you need to download an Excel spreadsheet template from HubEx, fill it with your data and import it into the system - so you can easily add basic entities for HubEx work and you can quickly get started.  In this case, the template can be empty or include data from the system, and in case of entering incorrect data, HubEx will not make a mistake and will return a message that there is a problem with the data.  Thus, you can easily overcome one of the main steps of automation - filling the automatic system with already available data. <br><br><h4>  <font color="#ed1940">HubEx Entities</font> </h4><br>  Application - the main essence of HubEx.  You can create any type of application (normal, emergency, guarantee, planned, etc.), customize a template or several templates for quick application.  Inside it, an object is specified, the address of its location (with a map), the type of work, criticality (specified in the directory), deadlines for execution, the performer.  You can add a description to the application, attach files.  The application records the start time of completion and completion, thus, the responsibility of each employee becomes quite transparent.  You can also set estimated values ‚Äã‚Äãof labor costs and the approximate cost of work on the application. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c17/746/4ca/c177464caaa738c077b43304ed2543f8.png"><br>  <i><font color="#999999">Application Form</font></i> <i><font color="#999999"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/92d/d41/651/92dd4165153e6f9a36dd27d569ffa825.png"><br></font></i>  <i><font color="#999999">Ability to create application stages based on company requirements</font></i> <i><font color="#999999"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/49c/0cb/5ce/49c0cb5ce28449659101efdc8dae9452.png"><br></font></i>  <i><font color="#999999">Constructor of transitions between the stages of the application, within which it is possible to prescribe the stages, connections, conditions.</font></i>  <i><font color="#999999">A schematic description of such a ‚Äúroute‚Äù is similar to the design of a business process, and can be used for a variety of purposes.</font></i> <br><br>  Each application is attached object (equipment, territory, etc.).  An entity can be any entity that is to be served by your company.  When an object is created, its photo is set, attributes, files, contacts of the responsible person, types of work, and checklists for specific equipment are linked.  For example, if you need to diagnose a vehicle, the checklist will include attributes that list important components, units, and test and diagnostic steps.  In the course of work, the master will check every item and will not miss anything. <br><br>  By the way, you can quickly submit an application by scanning a QR code (if the equipment is marked by the manufacturer or service) - this is convenient, fast and as productive as possible. <br><br>  The employee card allows you to add maximum information about the person in charge: his full name, contacts, type (it is especially interesting that you can start a customer as an employee and give him access to HubEx with limited rights), company, role (with rights).  In the additional tab, an employee's qualification is added, from which it is immediately obvious what kind of work and on what objects a master or engineer can perform.  Also, an employee (customer) can be banned, for which it is enough to switch the ‚ÄúBan‚Äù button in the ‚ÄúOthers‚Äù tab - after that, the HubEx functions will become unavailable for the employee.  A very convenient feature for service personnel, when a quick response to a violation can be vital for a business. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e58/07c/ce2/e5807cce27bcd1ea5818b5203a1323a6.png"><br>  <i><font color="#999999">Employee passport</font></i> <br><br>  As we have already said, in addition, in the HubEx interface, you can create checklists, within which to prescribe attributes ‚Äî that is, items that need to be controlled as part of working with each type of equipment. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e5b/ac2/6de/e5bac26dee152302bc6b996fdf5a6cfb.png"><br><br>  According to the results of work within the HubEx system, a dashboard with analytics is formed, where the achieved values ‚Äã‚Äãand indicators are displayed in the form of tables and graphs.  In the analysis panel, you can view statistics on the stages of applications, overdueness, the number of applications in the context of companies and individual engineers and craftsmen. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/9d2/2b2/378/9d22b237821b7ec958ad3e4355aeb477.png"><br>  <i><font color="#999999">Analytical reports</font></i> <br><br>  Repair, maintenance and service is not a one-time process, but a recurring task that, in addition to the technical function, carries a commercial burden.  And, as you know, there is an unwritten law: if something happened more than two times - automate it.  So we created in HubEx <i><b>automatic creation of planned applications</b></i> .  For the finished application template, the schedule of its automatic repetition with flexible settings is set: frequency, repetition interval during the day (reminder), number of repetitions, days of the week for creating applications, etc.  In fact, the setting can be any, including bound to the time before the start of work, for which you need to create an application.  The functionality turned out to be in demand both for service and management companies (for routine maintenance), and for companies of different groups - from cleaning and car center to system integrators, etc.  Thus, service engineers can notify the customer about the next service, and managers can re-sell services. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/401/d07/9f7/401d079f7fc0db1614376648df9139be.png"><br><br><h2>  <font color="#ed1940">HubEx: mobile version</font> </h2><br>  Good service is not just operational or professional engineering staff, it is primarily mobility, the ability to quickly go to the client and begin to solve his problem.  Therefore, without an adaptive application, no way, but better, of course, a mobile application. <br><br>  The mobile version of HubEx is two applications for iOS and Android platforms. <br>  HubEx for customer service - a working application for service employees in which they can create objects, keep records of equipment, see the status of work on an application, keep correspondence with dispatchers and necessary colleagues, communicate with the customer directly, coordinate the cost of work, evaluate their quality. <br><br>  To accept and mark an object using a mobile application, it is enough to point a mobile phone at it and take a picture of a QR code.  Then, in a convenient screen form, the remaining parameters are found: the company associated with the equipment, description, photo, type, class, address, and other necessary or customized attributes.  Of course, this is a very handy feature for mobile customer services, craftsmen and engineers on the road, outsourcing companies.  Also in the application of the engineer it is visible his applications and applications for approval.  And of course, the program sends users push notifications with which you will not miss a single event in the system. <br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/fc0/0c7/5db/fc00c75dbc0bc7427b0ad734028e776e.png" width="460"></div><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/82d/e6a/88c/82de6a88ce6f7ad7a356d330536bedea.png" width="460"></div><br>  Of course, all information immediately goes to the central database and managers or managers in the office can see all the work before the engineer or master returns to the workplace. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c03/721/299/c03721299980c2620d34cfe9489b44d7.png" width="460"></div><br>  HubEx for the customer is a convenient application in which you can apply for maintenance, attach photos and attachments to the application, monitor the repair process, communicate with the contractor, agree on the cost of work, evaluate their quality. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/8c8/eda/8d7/8c8eda8d7ed8e37694e7a8d487daa67d.png" width="460"></div><br>  Such a two-way implementation of a mobile application provides transparency of relationships, controllability of work, understanding of the actual repair point at a specific point in time - thus, the number of customer complaints is significantly reduced and the call center or technical support is reduced. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#ed1940">HubEx Chips</font> </h2><br><h4>  <font color="#ed1940">Electronic passport equipment</font> </h4><br>  Each object, each piece of equipment can be marked with a QR code generated by the HubEx system, and already with further interactions you can scan the code and receive an electronic passport of the object, which contains the basic information on it, the relevant documents and files. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/298/9d5/af3/2989d5af3bdc71c2b275f428ee941a89.png"><br><br><h4>  <font color="#ed1940">All staff, in full view</font> </h4><br>  While this article was created, we released the next release and introduced very important functionality from the point of view of the service department: you can track the geolocation of the mobile employee on the map and thereby track the route of his movement and being at a specific point.  This is a tangible plus for solving quality control issues. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/fd3/753/87d/fd375387dabcb6799b18ecfdbf243803.png"><br><br>  As you already understood, it is important for software of this class not only to be able to accept and process applications, but also to issue metrics of employee performance (after all, service engineers like me are tied to KPI, which means you need a complex of accurate, measurable and relevant indicators).  The parameters for assessing the quality of work can include, for example, the number of repeated visits, the quality of filling in applications and checklists, the correctness of movement in accordance with the routing list, and of course, an assessment of the work performed by the customer. <br><br><hr><br>  In fact, HubEx is the case when it‚Äôs better to see once than read a hundred times on Habr√©.  In the next series of articles, we will address the issues of the work of various service centers, analyze why the masters and employees are so evil, we will tell you what the service should or should not be.  By the way, if you have steep stories of fakaps or finds in the field of equipment maintenance, write in a comment or in person, we will definitely use cases and give a link to your company (if you give to this good). <br><br>  We are ready for criticism, suggestions, finds and the most constructive discussion in the comments and personal messages.  Feedback for us is the best thing that can happen, because we have chosen our development vector and now we want to know how to become number one for our audience. <br><br>  And if not Habr, then a cat? <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/05f/16b/cd5/05f16bcd5ffc7f90f5ba72ebb6c30066.png" width="777"></div><br>  <i><font color="#999999">Only not this one!</font></i> <br><hr><br>  <i>And taking this opportunity, we congratulate our leader and founder Andrei Balyakin on the winter victories of the 2018-2019 season.</i>  <i>He is the World Champion of 2015, European Champion of 2012, four-time champion of Russia 2014 - 2017 in snow kiting and kitesurfing.</i>  <i>Windy sports for a very serious person - the key to the success of fresh ideas in the development :-) But, I think, we will tell more about this.</i>  <i>You can read about how people from St. Petersburg win <a href="http://www.sobaka.ru/city/sport/69446">here</a> .</i> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/460002/">https://habr.com/ru/post/460002/</a></p>
