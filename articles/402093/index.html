Humble yourself.  You have no other choice.  Or you get nothing.  Have you ever heard these words in life? <br><br>  What is justice?  What role does it play in human behavior, how does it regulate social relations, is it an evolutionary advantage?  Why, in some cases, do people show irrational behavior by refusing direct benefits? <br><br>  This human quality - a sense of justice - has repeatedly been tried by scholars.  Historically, in such experiments <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0167268182900117">, an ultimatum game</a> , a kind of ‚Äúbargain game‚Äù (or bargaining games) is used.  The ultimatum game assumes that one of the players is limited in the set of possible offers.  He is given only one choice.  And he is free to agree with this choice or reject it.  As a result, the game has only two outcomes. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  In the study of human behavior, including justice, traditionally use the game ultimatum for money.  In this case, one player receives a certain amount as a gift (for example, $ 100) and must share this money with the second player (for example, keep $ 70 and give $ 30).  The second player can accept the offer (the money will be divided in the proposed proportion) or reject it (both will not receive anything).

      <a href="http://press.princeton.edu/titles/7517.html">Experiments</a> have shown that in gambling games, most players reject too low ‚Äúunfair‚Äù amount offers.  This happens even to the detriment of its own benefit.  That is, people often refuse money in general - if only the second player does not receive an unfairly large share of the total money.  See the <a href="https://geektimes.ru/post/286664/">comment on GT from the participant in the experiment</a> <a href="https://geektimes.ru/users/zigfrid_n/" class="user_link">Zigfrid_n</a> , which perfectly explains the motivation of the players. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Comment Zigfrid_n</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  I personally participated in this experiment.  Here is how it was.  We, three business partners, went to business training.  The trainer in the process took me aside and secretly set the task from others: agree ONLY on this section: 90% to me and 10% to another.  Then he announced the game.  I have another partner with me.  The trainer gave the partner a 100 dollar bill and said that if a partner agrees to divide with me, we will take the money.  That is, the partner seemed to be the ‚Äúowner‚Äù of the money (he held them), and he was the first to suggest sharing, of course, in half.  And I like him, "no, 90 bucks to me, 10 to you."  One should have seen the face of a partner ... As a result, one partner (male, 35 years old) did not agree to such conditions.  Type of dishonest.  The second was a woman, 30 years old - she agreed.  When analyzing the situation, the coach was interested in why she agreed to the obviously unfair conditions.  She said - well, like we are partners, then we will be considered.  The coach asked another partner why he suddenly decided to lose $ 10 ... :-) <br><br>  In fact, the reason is that in any (almost) game, as a rule, there are two sides on an equal footing.  And they confront each other.  And then suddenly it turns out that the conditions are not equal.  This really infuriates and causes an irrational desire to annoy the opponent.  Although, how to say, is it irrational?  Because his losses in the game exceed mine by a factor of six.  That is, I lost $ 10, and he - $ 90, it turns out I won?  If we consider the game as a rivalry, then the strategy is quite advantageous.  As in chess, I sacrifice a pawn - the enemy loses the queen.  And if we consider it as cooperation, another strategy is advantageous - to agree.  And we both get $ 100!  Zagutim new business.  :-) <br><br>  This game has a lot to say about people and how they relate to others.  How to partners or rivals.  The sense of justice and logic are not fully applicable.  Indeed, in different situations this or that choice will be logical and correct. </div></div><br>  Rejection of a smaller amount - this behavior is completely irrational.  The player will have no chance of re-dividing the money.  He will not be able to return the amount he refused.  Suppose that a certain number X is greater than zero.  In this case, the zero will always be less than X, no matter how small X. What can be incomprehensible here?  This is completely logical.  The most amazing thing is that such a simple basic logic <math></math><span class="MathJax_Preview" style="color: inherit; display: none;"></span><span class="MathJax_SVG" id="MathJax-Element-1-Frame" tabindex="0" style="font-size: 100%; display: inline-block; position: relative;" data-mathml="<math xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot;><mn>0</mn><mo>&amp;lt;</mo><mi>X</mi></math>" role="presentation"><svg xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" width="6.241ex" height="2.057ex" viewBox="0 -780.1 2687.1 885.9" role="img" focusable="false" style="vertical-align: -0.246ex;" aria-hidden="true"><g stroke="currentColor" fill="currentColor" stroke-width="0" transform="matrix(1 0 0 -1 0 0)"><use xlink:href="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://habr.com/ru/post/402093/&amp;xid=25657,15700022,15700186,15700191,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhjxRWSy0CVr-7pL68SEKLBcfaHkUw#MJMAIN-30" x="0" y="0"></use><use xlink:href="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://habr.com/ru/post/402093/&amp;xid=25657,15700022,15700186,15700191,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhjxRWSy0CVr-7pL68SEKLBcfaHkUw#MJMAIN-3C" x="778" y="0"></use><use xlink:href="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://habr.com/ru/post/402093/&amp;xid=25657,15700022,15700186,15700191,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhjxRWSy0CVr-7pL68SEKLBcfaHkUw#MJMATHI-58" x="1834" y="0"></use></g></svg><span class="MJX_Assistive_MathML" role="presentation"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mn>0</mn><mo>&lt;</mo><mi>X</mi></math></span></span><script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-1"> 0 <X </script>  it is understandable even for great apes like chimpanzees.  They always agree to a deal when they are offered to get a portion of the food while dividing the total heap.  See the article on the <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17916736">absolute rationality of chimpanzee behavior</a> . <br><br>  Any part of the meal is better than nothing.  Chimpanzees understand this, but people do not. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/597/f45/84c/597f4584ca0233753696fd43a1e17cf1.jpg"><br>  <i>A chimpanzee named Ayumu undergoes a memory test at the Institute of Primate Studies of Kyoto University (Japan)</i> <br><br>  The striking irrationality of human behavior, which is commonly associated with higher abstract thinking and such a concept as "honesty", attracts the attention of scientists. <br><br>  So, the fact of having a sense of justice is scientifically established.  But what does it mean in practice?  Is this a purely abstract concept, a certain ‚Äúdefect‚Äù of human logic - or a socially significant phenomenon? <br><br>  Scientists went further, and in 2012 <a href="http://www.nature.com/articles/srep00593">another series of experiments</a> was conducted, the continuation of the classic game of ultimatum with the section of the amount of money.  Only here, instead of money, people were offered water.  As scientists have recently found out, water makes a person have a natural desire to receive it, just as the physical presence of a product increases the desire to pay for it (see the article ‚Äú <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/50298367_Pavlovian_Processes_in_Consumer_Choice_The_Physical_Presence_of_a_Good_Increases_Willingness-to-Pay">Pavlov</a> 's <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/50298367_Pavlovian_Processes_in_Consumer_Choice_The_Physical_Presence_of_a_Good_Increases_Willingness-to-Pay">processes in consumer behavior of a person</a> ‚Äù). <br><br>  This experiment was supplemented by another, in which the test subjects were artificially thirsty.  This usually requires deprivation of fluid for 24 hours under the supervision of experimenters or prolonged physical exercises in the heat, which is usually done in military experiments when studying the <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11812391">change in mental abilities during dehydration</a> and other effects. <br><br>  In this case, the subjects injected intravenously with a hypertonic solution of NaCl (saline was injected in the control group) to induce strong thirst. <br><br>  Scientists wanted to test how the objective physiological needs of a person influence the supposed motivation for justice.  It has long been known that physiological needs, such as severe hunger, greatly enhance egoistic behavior (by the way, this partly explains the behavior of chimpanzees in the ultimatum game). <br><br>  Experience has shown that in the presence of strong thirst, the choice of a person really changes greatly, and the sense of justice is dulled.  The graph shows the subjective feeling of thirst in experimental subjects who were injected with saline (left) and those who were injected with hypertonic NaCl solution (right). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/eab/0fc/b17/eab0fcb17faf224dcf9df9916a5f34af.jpg"><br><br>  After entering the saline, people showed a standard sense of justice, as was the case with the game for money.  Most refuse to accept a glass with a small amount of water that another player has cast from the total share.  With induced thirst, behavior changes dramatically.  Most people now even agree to take a sip of water.  Thus, their behavior becomes more logical and predictable. <br><br>  But the most interesting thing is that even in a state of strong thirst, a significant proportion of people (even if a minority) still refuse to accept the unfair sharing of water!  This is similar to some kind of sacrifice when a person is willing to suffer, but will not tolerate injustice. <br><br>  Scientists can not yet find an explanation for this unique property of (some) people as an irrational, illogical sense of justice.  According to one version, this may be some imperative from childhood, nested or acquired quality.  The sense of justice can be part of some kind of social strategy of altruism - a person acts in the way that benefits the whole community, not him. <br><br>  Scientists note that people are not inclined to reject the wrongful section, if it does not affect the share that went to another player.  In other words, a person refuses a small share only on condition that another player takes a large share. <br><br>  But even in the absence of feedback, there remains a small percentage of those who refuse an unfair share - even if it doesn‚Äôt affect anything.  Probably in such life can be called "incorrigible idealists."  It is quite possible that the existence of such people - the victims voluntarily deprived of material benefits for the sake of idealistic principles - is somehow important for the whole of society. <br><br>  In any case, the phenomenon of "irrational" sense of justice needs additional study, scientists believe. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/402093/">https://habr.com/ru/post/402093/</a></p>
