  <section class="page js-page"><h1>CyberMonday starts at BlackFriday</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  CyberMonday was invented by very cunning marketers for the sole purpose of extending the <s>store's cash flow to the</s> pleasure of Black Friday customers.  As planned by the creators of CyberMonday, the office workers who had not yet cooled off the heat of the sale were supposed to devote working Monday to shopping in online stores from office computers.  Since Monday is always hard to work, and online trading is growing at a tremendous pace, the trick has taken root.  A little later, the technological name of Cyber ‚Äã‚ÄãMonday was joined by stores of software, music, films and electronic versions of books.  <b><a href="http://www.templatemonster.com/ru/">Template Monster</a></b> decided to keep up and arrange its four-day cyber boom. <br><br> <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/tmru/blog/271833/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/08b/fd0/0f9/08bfd00f976e4f20879cc621ed999c68.jpg"></a> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  <font color="2673b4">Thinking of you</font> </h2><br>  So, we offer a discount of 60% absolutely on all products.  This, for example, means that a <a href="http://www.templatemonster.com/ru/landing-page-templates-type/">Wordpress template</a> without installation can cost you only $ 30.  Usually during sales at the buyer in the head one question matures: ‚ÄúCheap, you have to take!  But why do I need this? ‚ÄùWe decided to help those who think a little, why we need a template for about 2000 rubles and it is expensive or cheap.  Judge for yourself. <br><br><ul><li>  Wordpress is one of the most popular CMS in the world.  Especially it is good for blogs and simple services sites, but it is increasingly gaining the attention of B2B companies due to the simplicity of management and a variety of good design solutions ‚Äúfor it‚Äù.

    </li><li>  It is expensive and time-consuming to make even the simplest site with user acceptance.  Wordpress templates help solve this problem - just download the finished files - and you get your site.  It remains to fill it with the necessary information and you can begin the work: tie social networks, start up traffic from sites and contextual advertising.  Well, or just call your friends to read your travel reports or inventions. <br><br></li><li>  When making a website, it is difficult to foresee all the features of design that matter for commerce - attracting customers and sales.  The templates use already approved color and design solutions that are able to keep the user on the site.  By the way, we have <a href="http://www.templatemonster.com/ru/landing-page-templates-type/">landing templates</a> . <br><br></li><li>  To make a website, you need a professional, or a freelancer, or a freelance professional, as lucky.  You can manage templates with minimal administration and programming skills.  Most of those who came to the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãlaunching their site have them. </li></ul><br>  <b>Why Template Monster?</b> <br><br><ul><li>  In our online store, you can choose templates in 66 business categories: from jewelry and flirting to science and sports.  I bet you will fall into at least one of the 66 categories? <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/2bb/fb6/d98/2bbfb6d985074b7194f736cb159fa7c8.png"><br><br></li><li>  In a special section, you can try on a template - see how it will look on desktops, tablets and smartphones. <br><br></li><li>  In addition to the usual, TemplateMonster offers premium templates and multi-page templates. <br><br></li><li>  No matter how great <a href="http://www.templatemonster.com/ru/wordpress-themes-type/">Wordpress is</a> , we are not limited to it - you can choose templates for other CMS (including <a href="http://www.templatemonster.com/ru/moto-cms-3-templates-type/">MotoCMS</a> , <a href="http://www.templatemonster.com/ru/joomla-templates-type/">Joomla</a> , <a href="http://www.templatemonster.com/ru/prestashop-themes-type/">PrestaShop</a> and <a href="http://www.templatemonster.com/ru/magento-themes-type/">Magento</a> ), but you can choose templates for social networks - and then the brand page will stand out from the rest and become your small embassy, ‚Äã‚Äãfor example, in Facebook. <br><br></li><li>  You can buy online store templates and then next Black Friday you will be in the game with your well-developed and developed online store. <br><br></li><li>  We also have logo templates, multimedia presentations, photo galleries for photographers of all stripes, music, videos, and a lot of things that will quickly make your website stand out from a number of competitors. <br><br></li><li>  We know everything about templates and sell, perhaps, the best templates on the web. <br><br></li><li>  Until November 30, a 60% discount on everything that we have listed and forgot to transfer.  Did we already say that? </li></ul><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/482/15c/316/48215c3165db4713a56a56c91a63c49b.png"></div><br>  In general, it is believed that Monday is good for the start of a new life.  Why not start a new business or take a step forward by starting to create your story on the Internet?  By the way, you can give a purchased template to a friend who could use it for its intended purpose or buy it in reserve in order to deal with it during the New Year holidays and start the new year with a good website that can sell or delight - in short, fulfill your goals. <br><br><h2>  <font color="2673b4">Thinking of others</font> </h2><br>  As you already could see, Template Monster is non-greedy guys and we decided to tell in our post about our findings of interesting actions of Black Friday and Cyber ‚Äã‚ÄãMonday.  Moreover, nothing human is alien to us and we have already managed to fall victim to some sales.  For example, <br><br>  <b>Selectel.</b>  Only one day the guys offer a 50% discount on the cost of renting servers.  To get the service at the promotional price, just go to the <a href="https://selectel.ru/services/dedicated/">appropriate section</a> .  Why do you need a server?  To host your website there, which you will create using our templates. <br><br>  <b>Madrobots.</b>  Want GoPro Hero 4 Black Edition for 1 ruble?  Then you <a href="http://madrobots.ru/">here</a> .  There are a few social networks and gamification, but the odds are more than real.  Why do you need GoPro?  But what about the content for the same site that you create using our templates. <br><br>  If you met something unusual or some kind of action attracted you a lot, write in a comment or in a personal, we will publish the best in the same post.  Only here this is not necessary.  We ourselves know what is missing: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/56a/768/420/56a768420a384a188f594bb9fd7bb192.png" height="302"></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/271833/">https://habr.com/ru/post/271833/</a></p>
