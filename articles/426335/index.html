To reduce emissions, companies are increasingly turning to green technologies.  One of them is the fuel cells - this decision was the heir to the technology of NASA, which they wanted to use during a mission to Mars.

      Such devices are produced by several companies, one of them is Bloom Energy. <br><br>  Bloom Energy fuel cell was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/30/business/energy-environment/data-center-energy.html">developed by</a> K. R. Sridhar (KR Sridhar) in the 1990s.  Then he worked in a scientific laboratory that created the device for NASA.  And the space agency ordered a device that could be used to sustain life in a colony on Mars. <br><br>  Sridhar created a device that split water into oxygen for breathing and hydrogen for transport fuels.  It was powered by solar panels.  The device should have been sent to Mars in 2001, but the mission was canceled due to technical problems with the aircraft. <br><br>  Sridhar thought that if you "turn over" the processes occurring in the device, you get an installation that generates electricity from hydrogen and oxygen.  For the production of such devices (fuel cells), he founded Bloom Energy. <br><br>  The company's cells run on natural gas (but can use pure hydrogen).  When it enters the fuel cell, methane in the composition of natural gas is converted into hydrogen due to the interaction with water vapor, which is also fed into the device.  The hydrogen is then oxidized at the anode, which generates a current. <br><br>  The most attractive feature in fuel cells is environmental friendliness.  When a cell is operating on methane, greenhouse gases are emitted, but in a much smaller volume than at thermal power plants.  According <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2010/feb/22/bloom-box-fuel-cell-launch">to</a> Bloom Energy, their technology produces 60% less carbon dioxide than thermal power plants with the same capacity.  If the element works on hydrogen, it releases only water and does not harm the environment. <br><blockquote>  <i>‚ÄúOne of the main advantages of fuel cells is their noiselessness.</i>  <i>They do not have pumps, fans or any moving components.</i>  <i>- commented Sergey Belkin, Head of Development <a href="https://1cloud.ru/%3Futm_source%3Dhabrahabr%26utm_medium%3Dcpm%26utm_campaign%3Dmars%26utm_content%3Dblog">1cloud.ru</a> .</i>  <i>- This is especially important for data centers, where the noise level varies from 70 to 80 dB.</i>  <i>The introduction of such silent power supplies helps the data center provide employees with a more comfortable working environment. ‚Äù</i> </blockquote>  Bloom Energy devices are used in the data center by large companies.  They <a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/business/microsoft/microsoft-makes-a-crazy-bet-on-fuel-cells-to-feed-power-hungry-data-centers/">resemble a</a> mini-fridge, which is placed above the server racks.  The fuel cells themselves (inside) are compact and take up little space.  The length and width of a single Bloom Energy <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloom_Energy_Server">cell</a> is 10 cm, and the thickness is less than a centimeter.  The power of such a device is 25 watts. <br><br>  In 2017, Equinix, a data center service provider, <a href="https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/news/bloom-energy-plans-ipo-hopes-to-expand-data-center-fuel-cell-business/">made a</a> deal with the organization.  Bloom Energy will provide its Equinix data center with its fuel cells.  Adobe, Walmart, Yahoo, Google, AT &amp; T and other companies also <a href="https://www.bloomenergy.com/customers">work</a> with Bloom Energy. <br><br><h2>  Who else uses fuel cells </h2><br>  Other companies see fuel cell prospects.  In 2017, Microsoft <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-10-31/fuel-cells-backed-by-microsoft-for-power-hungry-data-centers">began building a</a> power plant based on this technology.  The station's capacity will be 10 megawatts, and the IT giant will spend $ 45 million to build it.  Fuel cells will allow Microsoft to reduce energy losses, which usually occur during its transfer to the data center. <br><br>  According to the head of Microsoft‚Äôs research program in the field of energy, Sean James, the company plans to nearly double the capacity of the plant in the future and sees great potential in technology.  James also said that at first Microsoft will use natural gas in its elements, but then it will switch to hydrogen fuel. <br><br>  "Power" of fuel cells and creates Apple.  The company has already <a href="https://www.farm-equipment.com/blogs/6-opinions-columns/post/16070-big-name-industries-helping-biomethane-and-rng-become-mainstream">built</a> a 10 megawatt installation at a data center in the city of Meiden and a 4 megawatt station at its headquarters in Cupertino. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/nd/fa/ii/ndfaiim9vputi2rrnar0oi38fcs.jpeg"><br>  <font color="#A9A9A9"><i>/ <a href="">Air Force</a> / PD</i></font> <br><br>  Some organizations are developing their own fuel cells, <a href="https://www.networkworld.com/article/3237176/data-center/microsoft-daimler-to-use-fuel-cells-to-power-data-centers.html">such as the automotive company Daimler</a> .  The management plans to create a data center that will completely rely on "green" electricity.  Most of the energy in it will provide wind turbines and solar panels.  Excess electricity will go to the production and storage of hydrogen for fuel cells, and the cells themselves will be used as an auxiliary power source for data centers. <br><br>  Individual countries are also investing in fuel cells.  In South Korea, six fuel cell stations are already operating with a total capacity of 300 megawatts. <br><br>  Korea <a href="https://www.powerengineeringint.com/articles/2018/08/feature-south-korea-flies-flag-for-fuel-cells.html">ranks</a> first in terms of electricity consumption in Asia and among the top ten world states that pollute the atmosphere more than others.  Moreover, in Korea, 70% of the territory falls on hills and mountains, so there is not enough space for wind and solar generators in the country.  Therefore, by 2022, the government plans to expand the total capacity of cell-based stations to 800 megawatts. <br><br><h2>  Disadvantages and prospects of technology </h2><br>  The main obstacle for companies that want to introduce fuel cells is the cost of the device.  One watt of a Bloom Energy cell <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloom_Energy_Server">costs</a> 7-8 dollars.  For a solar panel, the price of a watt <a href="https://news.energysage.com/how-much-does-the-average-solar-panel-installation-cost-in-the-u-s/">is</a> only 3 dollars.  This is partly due to the high cost of the components of the fuel cell, for example, they use a platinum catalyst. <br><br>  Another drawback is characteristic only for systems operating on hydrogen.  Fuel storage requires a technically complex infrastructure.  Hydrogen <a href="https://www.energy.gov/eere/fuelcells/hydrogen-storage">is</a> in a tank either in a liquid or in a compressed state.  In the first case, the storage has to maintain the temperature below -252.8 ¬∞ C, the boiling point of hydrogen.  In the second, a pressure of 350‚Äì700 bar is required. <br><br>  The researchers of the companies hope to solve both of these problems in the near future.  They <a href="https://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/fuel-cells-in-2017-are-where-solar-was-in-2002">intend to</a> continue to improve production processes, look for more affordable materials and reduce the cost of devices.  Infrastructure for fuel will be developed.  Scientists are creating new chemical methods for storing hydrogen in absorbed form, which do not require high pressure or low temperature. <br><br>  Due to the high cost of fuel cells, it is unlikely that in the near future they will begin to be massively used as the main source of electricity.  Most likely, companies will first create backup power systems based on cells (as they do in Daimler).  And the further spread of technology will depend on how manufacturers will be able to reduce production costs. <br><br><h5>  Several posts from our corporate blog: </h5><br><ul><li>  <a href="https://1cloud.ru/blog/kak-iaas-pomogaet-1c-franchisee%3Futm_source%3Dhabrahabr%26utm_medium%3Dcpm%26utm_campaign%3Dmars%26utm_content%3Dblog">How IaaS helps 1C franchisee: 1cloud experience</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://1cloud.ru/blog/our-system-architecture-evolution%3Futm_source%3Dhabrahabr%26utm_medium%3Dcpm%26utm_campaign%3Dmars%26utm_content%3Dblog">Evolution of cloud architecture 1cloud: modulation complexity</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://1cloud.ru/blog/zachem-nujen-monitoring%3Futm_source%3Dhabrahabr%26utm_medium%3Dcpm%26utm_campaign%3Dmars%26utm_content%3Dblog">Why do we need monitoring?</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://1cloud.ru/blog/virtualnyj-kompyuter-zapushchennyj-v-oblake-luchshe-schitat-zheleznym%3Futm_source%3Dhabrahabr%26utm_medium%3Dcpm%26utm_campaign%3Dmars%26utm_content%3Dblog">What is rented infrastructure better than the usual "iron"</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://1cloud.ru/blog/bezopasnost-dannih-v-oblake%3Futm_source%3Dhabrahabr%26utm_medium%3Dcpm%26utm_campaign%3Dmars%26utm_content%3Dblog">How secure data is in the cloud</a> </li></ul></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/426335/">https://habr.com/ru/post/426335/</a></p>
