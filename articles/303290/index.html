      In the US alone, 2/3 of the population is overweight, 25 million people suffer from diabetes, and half of the nation is forced to take prescription drugs due to health problems.  These difficulties do not have a ‚Äúmomentary‚Äù solution; only the introduction of a new philosophy leading to health and consistent care for your body will help to cope with them. <br><br>  One of the things Tony Robbins mentioned at the event seemed interesting to me: the first obstacle stopping people in life is fear, and the second is LACK OF ENERGY.  Think about it ... having no energy, you will not take any action and will not apply what you have learned. <br><br>  Energy is not only the basis of existence, but also the fuel that makes everything in our life real and possible. <br><br>  During the fourth day, the training was conducted mainly by Joseph McClendon III, and Tony Robbins appeared only on video. <br><br><h3>  <font color="#0071c5">Health philosophy</font> </h3><br>  To begin with, let us ask ourselves an extremely important question: what is health? <br>  The World Health Organization defines health as follows: <br><blockquote>  ‚ÄúHealth is a state of perfect physical, psychological and social well-being, and not just the absence of diseases or physical disabilities‚Äù </blockquote><br>  At the seminar ‚ÄúFree your inner strength,‚Äù Tony Robbins defined optimal health in one word: ENERGY. <br><br>  <b>Hence the following question: where does energy come from?</b> <br><br>  The answer is: from our cells. <br><br>  Our bodies are made up of trillions of cells, which are the basis of human life.  There are 3 things that cells need, not only for survival, but also for well-being. <br><br>  <b>1. Oxygen</b> <br>  Oxygen is the source of all energy in the body.  But it is precisely it that triggers such metabolic processes as assimilation (absorption), waste excretion, respiration, blood circulation and digestion. <br><br>  <b>2. Water</b> <br>  Water is the most common substance in the body.  It is used for splitting other substances, for their distribution and osmosis, and is also the medium in which chemical reactions take place. <br><br>  <b>3. The ability to get rid of toxins</b> <br>  During the event, many studies were carried out based on Dr. Otto Warburg‚Äôs teachings on cellular respiration, Dr. Harry Goldblatt on cell destruction due to lack of oxygen, and Dr. Alexis Carrel on the ability of cells to live forever.  All these researches belong to the Nobel laureates and are documented. <br><br>  Further, the main medium delivering oxygen and nutrients to the body is blood.  Being a "river of life", it transports oxygen and nutrients to the tissues of the body and removes waste. <br><br>  The main environment for the removal of toxins from the body - that is, providing one of the basic needs of the cells - is the lymphatic system.  It works in close cooperation with the blood circulation, cleansing the interstitial fluid, returning it to the blood, destroying toxins in the body.  Lymph in your body is three times more than blood. <br><br>  The circulatory and lymphatic systems are responsible for the life support of the body. <br><br><h3>  <font color="#0071c5">True source of disease</font> </h3><br>  The cause of the ailments is the accumulation of toxins in the bloodstream.  Our body is able to get rid of toxins, but if they accumulate more than it can remove, our health deteriorates, or the development of the disease begins. <br><br>  Indeed, the resulting illness or illness is an attempt by your body to heal itself. <br>  The disease serves as a cure. <br><br>  There are 4 ways to eliminate toxins: <br><ol><li>  leather; </li><li>  lungs / airways; </li><li>  intestines; </li><li>  urinary tract. </li></ol><br>  But 3 reasons for the accumulation of toxins in the bloodstream: <br><ol><li>  the arrival of more of them than you are able to withdraw; </li><li>  Supplements and / or raw and animal products (any substances that the body cannot use); </li><li>  any too sour diet. </li></ol><br>  Think about it ... What are the symptoms of illness or illness? <br><ul><li>  Joint pain; </li><li>  Lack of energy; </li><li>  Cough; </li><li>  Vomiting; </li><li>  Kidney / urinary system problems; </li><li>  Fever; </li><li>  Headache; </li><li>  Skin rash; </li><li>  Spasms; </li><li>  Flatulence; </li><li>  Etc... </li></ul><br>  <b>This is the reaction of your body TO POISTS!</b> <br><br>  These symptoms are an attempt to free your body from the poison you gave it.  The occurrence of any of these conditions is due to the fact that you have FRAUGHED your bloodstream and your body is trying to remove toxins and slags.  This is the desire of your body to cure itself. <br><br>  It is important to realize this.  I will not go into all the details and talk about all the tests conducted on the "Unleash The Power Within", but if you turn on common sense, you will understand that this is the way it is. <br><br>  Let's get straight to the point of the 12 basic principles of dynamic life: 8 gifts and 4 poisons. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0071c5">12 steps of pure energy</font> </h2><br>  The 12 steps to optimal health and vitality consist of 8 gifts that you wish to present yourself, and 4 poisons, the consumption of which you need to significantly reduce or eliminate. <br><br><h3>  <font color="#0071c5">Gift 1: The benefits of dynamic breathing and lymph movement</font> </h3><br>  As mentioned above, oxygen is the source of all the body's energy and the immediate need of our cells.  We can live without food for several weeks, without water for several days, but without oxygen, our life will end in a matter of minutes. <br><br>  Optimal cell oxygenation is absolutely necessary to maintain health, an achievement of which is impossible without proper nutrition, adequate fluid intake, exercise and stress management. <br><blockquote> ‚ÄúImproper breathing is a common cause of ill health.  If I need to reduce my recommendations for recovery to one piece of advice, it will be like this: learn to breathe correctly.  There is no more powerful ‚Äî and simpler ‚Äî daily practice for extending health and well-being than breathing. ‚Äù </blockquote><br>  Andrew Weil, Ph.D. <br><br>  Most people breathe shallowly.  When you experience stress or experience certain emotional states, your breathing algorithm gets lost.  Shallow breathing can even lead to a heart attack.  Also, its consequences can be panic attacks or anxiety. <br><br>  But it's not only that.  The lungs and lymphatic system is one of the mechanisms for removing waste from our bodies.  What is interesting: there is a motor for pumping blood (called the heart), but the lymphatic system does not have it. <br><br>  The only way to stimulate it is deep diaphragmatic breathing. <br><br>  That is why it is so important to perform daily breathing exercises that will boost your lymphatic system, or use something like a springboard (mini-springboard), which I do during my morning gymnastics. <br><br>  The key is to breathe deeply through the diaphragm.  <b><a href="http://blog.mbaconsult.ru/blog/personal/10-zabavnykh-uprazhneniy-kotorye-pomogut-vam-stat-bolee-uspeshnym-predprinimatelem/">One simple exercise</a></b> you can do is to inhale for 4 counts, hold your breath for 16, and then exhale for 8. Use the 1: 4: 2 ratio several times a day to clear the lymph. <br><br><h3>  <font color="#0071c5">Gift 2: The benefits of life-giving water and raw foods</font> </h3><br>  Water is the main component of the body.  Our brain consists of it by 76%, lungs by 90%, and blood plasma by 98%.  Such important processes as digestion, blood circulation and excretion cannot proceed without water.  It provides nutrients for all vital substances for the body, plays a key role in maintaining body temperature, and contributes to the creation of components necessary for development and recovery. <br><br>  Tony Robbins talks about a man named Dr. Batmanghelidzh, who wrote the book ‚ÄúYour Body Frequently Requests Water‚Äù (‚ÄúYour Body's Many Cries For Water‚Äù) and tells how he managed to treat his patients in an Iranian prison using only water. <br><br>  If you experience thirst or dry mouth, then you are REALLY dehydrated and should drink water immediately. <br><br>  <b>How much water do you need?</b> <br><br>  Daily you should drink at least half your own weight in ounces (1 ounce = 30 ml).  So, if you weigh 90 kg, then you should consume 3 liters of water per day.  Ideally, you should take at least a sip of fluid every 15‚Äì20 minutes.  Yes, part of my morning routine is this: after waking up, the first thing I drink is a lot of water, because at this very moment the body is dehydrated the most. <br><br>  This is what interested me: if you are hungry, you should first drink and concentrate on breathing.  In many cases, the body suffers from a lack of fluid and oxygen.  And after such a procedure, hunger often subsides. <br><br>  Another important aspect of this principle is the use of products containing water, for example, raw vegetables, fruits and greens.  At least 70% of your diet should consist of watery foods so that your body can cleanse itself.  In the diet of the average American, only 15% of the dishes are saturated with water, which can be considered suicidal.  If your diet contains less than 70% "wet" foods, then you are clogging up your body, not clearing it. <br><br><h3>  <font color="#0071c5">Gift 3: Benefits of Essential Oils</font> </h3><br>  The presence in the diet of essential fatty acids is a key moment for our health.  They are necessary for the normal operation of each cell, especially the brain, 60% of fat.  Most people think that fat is harmful and is trying to get rid of it with all its might, but the truth is that certain fats are good for us and we should get them daily. <br><br>  These "good" fats are made up of essential fatty acids - omega-3 and omega-6.  These components are necessary for your body to survive, because without them, the lipid membranes surrounding the cells begin to break down. <br><br>  Essential fatty acids are essential for the vital activity of cells, tissues and organs.  They increase the rate of oxidation and metabolism.  The energy level increases, increasing the vitality and reducing recovery time.  They are useful for skin, digestion and cardiovascular system, increase your mood, stabilize the pulse and have many other advantages! <br><br>  PS We recommend another article on the topic - <a href="http://blog.mbaconsult.ru/blog/karera/vremya-pokonchit-s-60-chasovoy-rabochey-nedeley/">Why is it time to end the 60-hour work week?</a>  . <br><br>  Translated by Vyacheslav Davidenko, founder of <a href="http://www.mbaconsult.ru/">MBA Consult</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/303290/">https://habr.com/ru/post/303290/</a></p>
