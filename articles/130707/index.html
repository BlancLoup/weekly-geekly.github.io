This is an old old school site, covered in scars and crutches. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/0aa/765/79d/0aa76579d7d4d81594502a69f31d1365.jpg" alt="image"><br>  A modest community of tourists, not those from the word "tour" and "tagiil", but those with a guitar and a campfire, as well as cyclists.  There are more than 10,000 of us who left several messages on the forum, and up to 10,000 people a day.  The largest forum is 5,500 people.  I will try to tell the story of our non-commercial cozy site. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h5>  Briefly about the concept of creation. </h5><br>  Initially, the site was conceived with the idea that people who prefer to spend weekends outside the home (oh, the word outdoor is not enough in Russian) is a completely separate class of people, and they can change the type of recreation, but not the lifestyle.  Today, a person is fascinated by a parachute, tomorrow is diving, the day after tomorrow is a speleology and parallel fire show, the bike changes from mountain to road, the jeep changes to enduro motorcycle, but the drive to travel, extreme sports, adrenaline does not disappear anywhere.  The idea was right. <br><br><h5>  Financial component </h5><br>  The investment is minimal, everything went out of my pocket.  Now the site is invested only what he earns.  I‚Äôm on the site alone when money accumulates, they all spend money on the programmer‚Äôs work on adding all sorts of buns for which I don‚Äôt have enough time for charity and other things.  Not for profit, it is for the soul.

    <h5>  Story </h5><br><br>  2003 - a personal page in pure HTML, where reports on trips and descriptions of curious places in the Kharkiv region were laid out.  The phpbb forum was immediately bolted.  Pretty soon, emails of other people began to come in by email - they were laid out too. <br>  2005 - Laziness won pretty quickly and people were sent to add reports on their own - the report editor was written. <br>  2006 The Forum developed - a huge kick in development was given when the mod created invitations to pokatushki.  Especially bikers love it.  Redesign, new features, offline events, such as "All-Ukrainian Veloden" (170 people).  Written popular in the "Internet" article "How I spun the forum" - under this name she walks everywhere. <br>  2007 - the site's engine is being rewritten, opportunities are added to the forum, Veloden is held (700 people) <br>  2008 - I already remember attendance.  It almost doubles every year - in 2008 it was 1,500 a day.  1500 people come to Veloden. <br>  2009 - attendance up to 3000. <br>  2010 - attendance up to 5000. <br>  2011 - attendance up to 10,000 - 5,500 people arrived at Veloden. <br>  Posts in the Forum 568353 |  Topics: 45878 |  Users: 20971 <br>  Non-random users, i.e.  left a few messages - more than 10,000 thousand. <br><br>  Why ‚Äúbefore‚Äù?  Because attendance is very seasonal - the maximum is usually in June, a decline in January. <br><br><h5>  Site engine </h5><br>  News, reports, articles - they are all classified by any number of sections.  The sections are two trees - by type of recreation, and by geography.  Well, any intersections of this classification are possible - if you want to see news, reports and articles on hiking trips - <a href="http://tourist.kharkov.ua/xtclass/foot">please</a> , and if you want on bike trips and only in the Crimea, <a href="http://tourist.kharkov.ua/xtclass/crimea/velo">nothing is easier either</a> .  And only reports on bicycles in Europe - <a href="http://tourist.kharkov.ua/all_report/europe/velo/1/1">like this</a> .  While the report does not receive voting points - it is not visible in the section and on the main one.  As a plus - will appear. <br><br><h5>  Report editor </h5><br>  This is what is my special love :) Once, as a tourist, I stopped adding reports after hikes, because it was a very tedious thing that took time.  Now we have tried to automate everything as much as possible - and I have not yet met a better solution. <br>  1. Up to hundreds of photos to choose with one click, view, turn around, massively compress to reasonable resolution and upload to the server - all this is flash 10 as3.  Clamping on the client is necessary, because 100 photos of 5 meters each are half a gigabyte, and they will be sent to the Internet for a long time.  Constricted same - an order of magnitude smaller and faster. <br>  2. Photos are all immediately inserted into the report text in the form of images 640 pixels wide.  When you click - see an enlarged copy. <br>  3. you can classify and publish. <br>  4. And export as BBcode to all your favorite forums. <br>  5. Add a gps trekking track with a mapping of Google, Yandex and a topographic map. <br><br><h5>  Forum in general </h5><br>  PHPBB of the current version is modeled - just dead.  Special mods: <br>  1. Invitation to hikes and pokatushkam.  Calendar with filters.  <a href="http://tourist.kharkov.ua/phpbb/cycleplan_index.php%3Fm%3D07%26y%3D2011%26type%3D">Under the link</a> - mod samopisny. <br>  2. A crazy reputation system - it has been working for a year - it has proven itself ideally - it filters inadequate, it raises the good fellows.  The bottom line is that by giving out a reputation (which is a plus, that a minus), the user loses the point of his reputation.  Several times minusanut impossible.  Received 10 minus goes to the autobahn.  Exchange and cheating appropriately excluded.  The pens of unwanted - too.  Earn plus, you can add a report or article that will be released in the top.  Well, or if you plyusanut. <br>  3. Module flea market.  Purchase and sale of any equipment and bicycle spare parts.  <a href="http://tourist.kharkov.ua/phpbb/viewforum.php%3Ff%3D44">Probably the largest in RuNet</a> .  Theme filter (wow), moderation, form when adding a new part. <br>  4. The system of friends, notification of drugs with the text immediately in the mail, photo galleries, multiattachi and much more. <br><br><h5>  Personal pages </h5><br>  All have a <a href="http://xn--80adckhftceoidck5c3j8b.tourist.kharkov.ua/">login</a> page. <a href="http://xn--80adckhftceoidck5c3j8b.tourist.kharkov.ua/">Tourist.kharkov.ua</a> <a href="http://xn--80apl3c.tourist.kharkov.ua/">For example, mine</a> .  Russian nicknames - roll.  In some browsers, even Russian nicknames with a space :) <br><br><h5>  Monetization </h5><br>  Banner.  But with this all the sadder.  Sapa - very helpful. <br><br><h5>  Hosting </h5><br>  Beat with sticks.  Normal hosting is not a server, not a cloud.  100,000 hits per day - pulls fine.  Habraeffekt pull hardly, but I especially do not wait for habraeffekt - a special note. <br><br>  To revive such a boring text - a little about yourself and active rest: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c6f/e52/3ee/c6fe523eedef97e2f30c3bfa450d3481.jpg" alt="image"><br>  I am in the middle :) <br><br>  I will answer questions. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/130707/">https://habr.com/ru/post/130707/</a></p>
