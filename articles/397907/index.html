A dozen people from Moscow, St. Petersburg and Ufa visited two museums, which contain the legendary exhibits of our space history.  These museums are not closed, but are located on a secure territory, and it is somewhat more difficult to get into them.  Each of the disembarked group could have guided tours themselves, and I am sure that you will soon see some more reports.  But each would have her own way.  I invite you to see my version. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  Frivolous entry </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/19a/665/b46/19a665b46b5e4f439c2d89caa895bd69.jpg"><br><br>  The entrance of the plant number 88, NII-88, OKB-1, TsKBEM, and now - RSC Energia.  Cosmonautics Day is a holiday that is always with you.  By the way, this photo of the rocket is the best that can be obtained without a quadrocopter.  It is forbidden to take photographs on the territory of the enterprise, so the photos will be only from the outside and inside the museums.

It is not at all surprising that, having seen the crowd of hipsters, the janitor strictly points out to us: ‚ÄúDo not take pictures on the territory!  Pokemon do not catch! ". <br><br><h4>  First museum </h4><br>  The first museum has a slightly strange name - "Center for Development and Training."  But it becomes clearer when we learn that schoolchildren are regularly brought here.  This is a huge hangar, in which there are rockets, spacecraft and orbital stations. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c6d/872/035/c6d8720352d9472c8859aefe7baafe34.jpg"><br><br>  <a href="https://www.facebook.com/photo.php%3Ffbid%3D1103476443040046%26set%3Da.804233176297709.1073741827.100001331028417%26type%3D3">On the link</a> interactive panorama of the hangar. <br><br>  The tour guide is Vakhtang Dmitrievich Vachnadze, a legendary man who became the fourth head of RSC Energia after Korolev, Mishin and Glushko and worked with him from 1977 to 1991.  Here he shows his first job as a designer - steering engines for the R-7 rocket.  According to his stories, Glushko refused to make rotating combustion chambers due to problems with feeding components along the axis of rotation, and Sergey Pavlovich Korolev transferred this task to young designers, including Vakhtang Dmitrievich. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/04b/d26/87c/04bd2687c9694ce29f6e9fda24a8d722.jpg"><br><br>  The territory on which we stand, in the 40s, belonged to the artillery plant number 88, so the beginning of the exhibition - the guns.  These are ZIS-2 and ZIS-3 developed at the neighboring Grabin plant, which was also transferred to the Queen in the late 50s. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/847/015/291/8470152913f34a6f8e9f038f850aa7e0.jpg"><br><br>  Near the wall of the hangar are the first Soviet ballistic missiles. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/cf7/3d5/460/cf73d546034c4dc68256ef03243b87a8.jpg"><br><br>  <a href="https://www.facebook.com/photo.php%3Ffbid%3D1103475813040109%26set%3Da.804233176297709.1073741827.100001331028417%26type%3D3">Interactive panorama</a> . <br><br>  Extreme on the left, in the section - V-2, assembled from captured German parts.  There were enough trophies for several rockets, they were launched in 1946, and one was turned into a training manual.  This metal was seen by the prisoners of the Mittelverke factory, the forty-year-old Korolev, and the young designers, who are now gray.  It is a pity that he can not speak. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/0be/121/20a/0be12120a8e8414392d84452f11224ea.jpg"><br><br>  For the Fau-2 go P-2 (an improved version adapted to the Soviet production of Fau-2 - P-1, range 550 km), P-5 (range already 1200 km), R-5M, R-9A (range up to 16,000 km, the highest), GR-1 (should have brought a warhead into orbit and had no range limitations, disassembled into two parts - first and fourth to the right) and solid-fuel missiles RT-1 and RT-2. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/65a/75c/e35/65a75ce35a1d42caa264ec32453a4d8d.jpg"><br><br>  Next to the missiles are engines and accelerating units.  Here is Block E, thanks to which the payload of the R-7 rocket increased from 1,300 to 4,500 kg, and the USSR was able to send stations to the Moon and launch man into space. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/646/e6d/f0f/646e6df0f1ea40448506f635849fa53a.jpg"><br><br>  Engine 11D58M, which stands on the upper stage DM (in the background). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/7c0/27e/9a1/7c027e9a13a140ea8a9c541544151e42.jpg"><br><br>  Propulsion system "Burana" <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/6a2/7ae/3e2/6a27ae3e2f8148aaa85c16471d6c9a07.jpg"><br><br>  Old plans for the future.
