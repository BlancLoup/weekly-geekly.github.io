Asadov </blockquote><br>  A few years ago, the network was walking around a story about a girl who wanted to buy such a car so that it would not be like everyone else, so that both the brand and the color were, if not exclusive, then at least rarely found.  She chose and bought herself a blue Mazda.  It was worth driving the car from the salon, as there were only blue Mazda around it. <br><br>  The conclusion from this story suggests the following: often we don‚Äôt notice the obvious things, we don‚Äôt see good opportunities, if we don‚Äôt know about them, we don‚Äôt focus on them;  but it is worth paying more attention to something, as it begins to loom constantly before our eyes.  In psychology, there is even a scientific name for this effect (thanks <a href="https://megamozg.ru/users/alcanoid/" class="user_link">Bacan</a> -Meinhof thanks <a href="https://megamozg.ru/users/alcanoid/" class="user_link">alcanoid</a> , in the book "Life as a startup. Build a career according to the laws of Silicon Valley" the concept of <b>serendipnost is used</b> ), <s>but I forgot it</s> .  With the light hand of the very girl I will use the definition of ‚ÄúBlue Mazda Rule‚Äù. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a86/927/37f/a8692737f0034627a99dfe05c896b8d6.jpg"><a name="habracut"></a>

      In the modern world, we are constantly in a huge information flow, we receive something from it, more often - we let the news through ourselves, without analyzing it thoroughly, and this is reasonable, otherwise it would be natural to go crazy.  This is the main achievement and the problem of our information technology age. <br><br>  In order to understand simple questions, we: <br>  a) we are trying to figure out ourselves on the basis of existing experience or knowledge; <br>  b) consult with people whose opinion we trust; <br>  c) surf the Internet and try to resort to the knowledge of imaginary experts. <br><br>  Often this is a mix of all three of the above options.  And that is why the search for an answer can be delayed, and we can get lost on the way to the intended goal or even leave it aside. <br>  Then it is necessary to run the rule of the "Blue Mazda". <br><br><h3>  How it works? </h3><br>  We take a question / request for which you need to get the most useful information and send it to the masses - social networks, forums, ask friends (even if they have no relation to this).  That is, we think about this issue and let it go without getting hung up.  This is important - do not get hung up (psychologically), the desires and questions that you get stuck on do not come true and are never solved.  We wait.  It does not take long to wait.  After a few days, answers or clues begin to appear around.  For example, in social networks there are topics on interesting questions (even if sometimes it is contextual advertising) - they were there before, but we did not notice them.  Friends, it turns out, have friends who are somehow related to the issue or topic of interest.  It remains only to receive and filter the information received. <br><br>  Nowadays, information is always around us, and it works in both directions: we ourselves are information centers for others. <br><br>  When I started to do my startup, I had complete confusion in my head, despite the fact that there were goals and a mission, and development paths.  Well, it was completely incomprehensible in what sequence to carry out all the planned steps!  And it seemed to me that the topic of development and promotion of start-ups in Russia is such a fresh, so incomprehensible and not all interesting topic (yeah, here you can laugh at the voice).  Then I launched "Blue Mazda" - sent a request and waited for answers.  And so I began to take interesting information, including advertisements and invitations to trainings for the development of start-ups.  Completely ‚Äúaccidentally‚Äù a friend turned out to be a friend working in an accelerator, and a friend had a friend who started a crowdfunding company.  So I learned that there are not only investors, but accelerators, business angels and other opportunities.  And then everything went like a snowball: as if a magnet began to attract the necessary information, which only needed to be checked and filtered. <br><br>  Validation of the information received is, as an option, your own experience and your own bumps.  Either the most authoritative opinion, but both can be wrong.  That is, in any case - you decide what information to use. <br><br>  It is necessary to understand that the rule of ‚ÄúBlue Mazda‚Äù extends precisely to the search for opportunities, ways and clues, and not to the fulfillment of desires.  That is, you are given a fishing rod, and then you use it yourself. <br>  But "Blue Mazda" always helps me in getting information. <br><br>  PS The rule described above is a small trick, using which you don‚Äôt have to stop at what you have achieved, you can always move on, knowing the possibilities that are endless for yourself. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/289490/">https://habr.com/ru/post/289490/</a></p>
