  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Questions to Carlos Olguin about his work in the field of 3d-bioprinting, substance programming, 4d design and not only</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img src="http://goo.gl/nYoMF9" alt="image" align="left"><br>  Carlos Olguin is the head of bio / nano / programmable substance research at Autodesk R &amp; D.  His group of 18 specialists is studying the design possibilities associated with substance programming, collaborating with researchers from leading research institutes and commercial companies from around the world.  On the eve of Carlos's arrival at <a href="http://goo.gl/pSkqHN">Autodesk University Russia,</a> I was able to ask him a few questions about his work. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b>Carlos, please tell us what your group does.</b>  <b>The main theme of your development is 3d printing of human organs?</b> <br>  Yes, our work includes bioprinting, but this is only a small part of what the group does.  In general, we are talking about programming a substance in different scales and different areas.  For example, one of our projects, which we are implementing together with partners from universities, is associated with synthetic biology.  Research in the field of 3D bio printing is carried out in cooperation with the company Organovo (San Diego), as well as other organizations involved in this technology.  In addition, we are studying the possibility of programming a substance on a large scale. <br>  An example of this is the work that we do in conjunction with Skylar Tibbits from MIT, at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.  This 28-year-old professor, architect, designer and IT specialist develops a technology called 4D printing, where the fourth dimension is time.  He builds large-scale structures capable of self-assembly.  4D printing is similar to 3D-bioprinting in the sense that in both cases the printed structure, whether it is a cell or something large of polymer, continues to change over time in accordance with the design concept.  Simply put, the processes occurring in nature, we transfer to production - this is 4D printing. <br>  <b>So, 4D printing goes beyond medicine and synthetic biology?</b> <br>  Imagine that you went to IKEA and bought a disassembled packed chair there.  When you open the package at home, the chair is automatically assembled.  Of course, this is not yet a ready technology, but an example of large-scale 4D printing research that we do with MIT. <br>  In addition, we work with space agencies, and this area is very important, as you understand.  With minimal resources in space, you can print everything you need, if necessary, or in an emergency.  Such technologies are very interested in the space industry, in particular, NASA - after all, we are talking about the possibility of three-dimensional printing of entire mechanisms that can evolve over time.  Again, nothing like this happens in space, but our team is doing it. <br>  <b>Is it the technology of the distant future?</b> <br>  In fact, they are now undergoing an ‚Äúincubation period‚Äù.  We expect that they will grow to an ‚Äúadult‚Äù state next year. <br>  <b>Tell me, what audience will be focused on your speech at Autodesk University Russia 2013?</b> <br>  The concepts that will be discussed are completely new, so we look forward to a very diverse audience.  In fact, I want to give an extreme example (we are not talking about AU Russia, of course) - we really like communicating with children, because they do not have an established point of view on design.  When we grow up, we get used to the ‚Äútop down‚Äù approach to things: things can be cut, torn by hands, assembled from parts.  3D-and 4D-printing are arranged completely differently, as well as the general programming of the substance.  In 3D bioprinting and 4D printing, as in synthetic biology, the top-down approach is irrelevant, since it is about introducing local constraints for the part, the application of which leads to the appearance of the desired design during its growth. <br>  Therefore, we want to see engineers of various directions, architects who are ready to learn to perceive the built world not as something static, but as something that can be continued to be designed in the process of evolution (construction).  This concept is in nature, and in many ways we are learning to apply it from nature - synthetic biology is engaged in this.  In it, we add to the natural living objects of the function, initially alien to them, but a similar technology can be used in production, construction and other areas. <br><br>  <i>This is, in fact, the announcement.</i>  <i>I hope, during the arrival of Carlos in Moscow will be able to find out the details.</i>  <i>You can post your questions in the comments.</i>  <i>Who goes to AU Russia will be able to ask questions personally (Carlos speaks on the second day of the event)</i> <br>  <i><b>UPD: The topic is moved to the Biotechnology hub and the Future is here.</b></i> </div>
