  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Overview of one docking station</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  A couple of years ago, when I bought my first iPod (and then the <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/apple/80920/">second one</a> ), I found the so-called docking adapter in the box.  Such a plastic platformochka with a hole for the connector.  At that time I did not know what it was and why.  Then, over time, I saw with my own eyes this docking station.  As it turned out, this is just a tabletop cradle, in common people called ‚Äúglass‚Äù.  Now I have a similar phone charging. <br><br><img src="http://bit.ly/kcnm5b" alt="image"><br><br>  At that time I did not understand, and honestly, I didn‚Äôt really want to understand why it was needed.  However, now many companies make docking stations, and this is not just a stand with charging, but also stylish speakers with which you can make a small multimedia center.  One of these stations fell into my hands, I did not have to use it before.

      PS At the end of the article a few links to unusual docking stations. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The idea of ‚Äã‚Äãa gadget, in my opinion, is beautiful.  To listen to loud music and not connect the player via Aux to the speakers, speakers are created in which you can simply put the device and listen to audio or enjoy the video.  Of course, there are many options for miniature speakers, but you cannot insert a player into them and watch a movie, that is, you need to think of something else to set your player upright.  And with a docking station, you can arrange a small cinema or disco without much stress. <br><br><h4><img src="http://bit.ly/mk1q5P" alt="image">  Appearance </h4><br>  So, I got a Fidelio docking station from Philips.  A nice device made with "zakos" under the Mac.  White, smooth, very pleasant to the touch.  In form it resembles a half of a huge egg, more precisely this form is difficult to describe. <br><br><img src="http://kuuuzya.narod.ru/Doc/1.JPG" alt="image"><br><br>  There are speakers hidden in front of the fabric, as well as a place for an iPod or iPhone.  The material is gray, the touch is pleasant and rough. <br><br><img src="http://kuuuzya.narod.ru/Doc/2.JPG" alt="image"><br><br>  In a kind of niche is a connector for devices.  He leans forward so that it is convenient to insert the device, and then again tilt it so that it stands slightly bent. <br><br><img src="http://kuuuzya.narod.ru/Doc/3.JPG" alt="image"><br><br>  And also a rubber strip so that your device is tightly standing in this station. <br><br><img src="http://kuuuzya.narod.ru/Doc/4.JPG" alt="image"><br><br>  Under the platform is a metal plate with the logo of the company, which is nothing more than a rocker button to change the volume.  By the way, it is very interesting that when you press the buttons, the volume does not change in the docking station, but in the player / phone itself, that is, the speakers are always set to the same volume level. <br><br><img src="http://kuuuzya.narod.ru/Doc/5.JPG" alt="image"><br><br>  Why in the device made a big hole, honestly, I do not understand.  Yes, it is convenient to keep it for him, but the times of the boomboxes are long gone and now people don‚Äôt go listening to DISCO.  It would be possible and more compact body then do. <br><br><img src="http://kuuuzya.narod.ru/Doc/6.JPG" alt="image"><br><br>  On the right side of the bottom there is a notch for three connectors.  This mini-USB, audio Aux-In 3.5 mm.  and power connector.  Everything is standardized, so even if you lose any cable, it will not be difficult to replace it. <br><br><img src="http://kuuuzya.narod.ru/Doc/9.JPG" alt="image"><br><br><h5><img src="http://kuuuzya.narod.ru/icons/cart.png" alt="image">  Equipment </h5><br>  Complete with a docking station goes in principle, everything you need for its work. <br><ul><li>  Dock itself </li><li>  USB cable </li><li>  Adapter 220 ~ </li><li>  Audio wire </li></ul><br><br><img src="http://kuuuzya.narod.ru/Doc/7.JPG" alt="image"><br><br><img src="http://kuuuzya.narod.ru/Doc/8.JPG" alt="image"><br><br>  Not enough, perhaps, the iPhone or iPod.  And the batteries, but about them later. <br><br><h4><img src="http://kuuuzya.narod.ru/icons/user.png" alt="image">  Functionality and sensations </h4><br>  So, this docking station is needed for several functions. <br><ol><li>  IPod / iPhone audio playback </li><li>  Play sound from any other device </li><li>  IPod / iPhone charging </li><li>  Stylish stand </li></ol><br><br>  Playing iPod is easy.  You insert the player on a special platform, which has a connector and that's it.  From now on, you can choose music or movies and listen to the sound through the docking station.  In principle, reproduction from any audio device is also simple.  Only for this you need to connect the device to the 3.5mm audio cable dock.  In essence, the station will simply act as speakers. <br><br>  As soon as you insert an iPod or iPhone into the port, provided that the station is connected to the computer, iTunes starts and your player or phone is determined as if it were connected with a regular cable.  You can download music to it, synchronize it and, of course, it charges. <br><br>  But there is an interesting feature in this device.  It can work autonomously.  To do this, a compartment for finger batteries x4 is made at the bottom of the corpus.  Thus, you can listen to your player even in the forest, on the beach, in general, wherever there is no outlet. <br><br><img src="http://kuuuzya.narod.ru/Doc/10.JPG" alt="image"><br><br>  Batteries, unfortunately, are not included.  :( <br><br><img src="http://kuuuzya.narod.ru/Doc/11.JPG" alt="image"><br><br>  The sensations of using this station are pleasant.  Plastic quality, all the elements worked out and thought out.  There were no difficulties, all the connectors came up and worked, the sound was reproduced.  The sound is adjustable conveniently.  Unless the ‚ÄúTurn off sound‚Äù button is missing, you have to quickly press either ‚Äústop‚Äù on the player or pull it out of the docking station to make it quiet. <br><br><h4><img src="http://kuuuzya.narod.ru/icons/sound.png" alt="image">  Sound </h4><br>  Once upon a time, when reviewing an iPod, I seemed to provide for and write about everything.  But I forgot one thing - sound.  I was very ashamed.  Now I am writing right away so as not to be in a delicate situation.  Like this, audio device and no sound description. <br><br>  No, now there will be no description about the <a href="http://lurkmore.ru/%25F2%25B8%25EF%25EB%25FB%25E9_%25EB%25E0%25EC%25EF%25EE%25E2%25FB%25E9_%25E7%25E2%25F3%25EA">warm tube sound</a> .  Although, in general, it is difficult to describe the sound with words, but I still try. <br><br>  In general, the sound in this docking station is solid 4. Up to 5 is not enough, because the low frequencies still do not reproduce the speakers as well as a separate subwoofer.  And also, sometimes the speakers fade a little.  Perhaps this is due to the presence of various waves in the apartment, but still, small noises were heard.  High frequencies play well, cleanly and loudly.  Feels like the sound.  Yes, this is not a professional system, but not the sound of a mobile phone.  The quality is quite close to the middle class type 2.0 speakers. <br><br><h4><img src="http://kuuuzya.narod.ru/icons/database.png" alt="image">  Summary </h4><br>  Summing up, I want to say that the docking station is not such a useless thing in the household.  Since it is convenient to listen to music, especially when the computer is turned off.  And also, quite comfortable to have it on the table as a charger.  And of course, happy offline work with the help of batteries.  Just a little let up the sound, but otherwise everything is super.  Stylish and fashionable device that looks good and is comfortable to use.  Even the price is not as high as you can expect for a docking station.  Although for the same price you can buy large speakers, but they will be large and stationary. <br><br>  Price: ~ 3000 p. <br><br>  Size comparison with a matchbox.  In the depth of 2 box, in height 3, in width a little more than three.  In general, here are the dimensions in millimeters: 562 x 214 x 216 mm. <br><br><img src="http://kuuuzya.narod.ru/Doc/12.JPG" alt="image"><br><br>  Photos with devices: <br>  iPod classic <br><br><img src="http://kuuuzya.narod.ru/Doc/222.JPG" alt="image"><br><br>  iPhone 4 <br><br><img src="http://kuuuzya.narod.ru/Doc/333.JPG" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>pros</b> <br><img src="http://kuuuzya.narod.ru/icons/add2.png" alt="image">  Stylish design <br><img src="http://kuuuzya.narod.ru/icons/add2.png" alt="image">  Availability of standard connectors <br><img src="http://kuuuzya.narod.ru/icons/add2.png" alt="image">  Acceptable sound quality <br><img src="http://kuuuzya.narod.ru/icons/add2.png" alt="image">  Autonomous work <br><br>  <b>Minuses</b> <br><img src="http://kuuuzya.narod.ru/icons/remove2.png" alt="image">  Small noises <br><img src="http://kuuuzya.narod.ru/icons/remove2.png" alt="image">  Slightly high price <br><br><h4><img src="http://kuuuzya.narod.ru/icons/link.png" alt="image">  Links </h4><br>  Having searched on Habr√© topics about the docking stations, I came across several interesting articles. <br><ul><li>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/DIY/87893/">Docking station for iPhone do it yourself</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/gadgets/54825/">Steampunk docking station</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/apple/54885/">Universal Dock Concept</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/personal/75240/">Docking station from a retro gadget</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/gadgets/75799/">Docking station and scales in one</a> </li></ul><br><br>  Thanks for attention. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/122778/">https://habr.com/ru/post/122778/</a></p>
