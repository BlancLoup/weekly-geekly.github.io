Huge masses <br>  people of completely different wealth and social status spend here very <br>  a lot of time.  Every user has a very detailed profile on such a network. <br>  revealing both personal and professional aspects of a person‚Äôs life.  Often <br>  people in such networks, forgetting that they are registered under their real names <br>  (obligatory conditions of these networks), get involved in skirmishes not coloring them <br>  in multiple subject groups.  They may also not be shown at best. <br>  view on photos by other users - just indicate them on the downloaded <br>  photographs.  What is the use of it for you? <br>  If you are a recruiter, then by accessing these networks you will be able to find out about the candidate for <br>  position in your company such information that is not written in the resume and which <br>  will not come up for an interview in any way, thereby reducing for you the percentage of ‚Äúrecruiting <br>  marriage. " <br>  You can also create and develop a popular community by your company profile. <br>  in the network and, typing a sufficient number of users, promote your <br>  product or service. <br>  <b>Thematic social networks</b> <br>  It's all very simple.  Not only professionals gather in these places. <br>  and masters of their craft, but also just people who are passionate about and love what they do. <br>  If you are looking for a dedicated, experienced employee, then start your search here. <br>  Also, if the network concerns the profile of your company, then you can give on this resource <br>  advertising, not worrying about the efficiency and level of return on the money invested <br>  - the best place on the Internet you can not find.  You can also sponsor rubrics and <br>  conduct promotions and contests, increasing the loyalty of industry gurus to your <br>  brand <br>  <b>Professional social networks</b> <br>  These networks mainly aim at hiring.  Here the participants try <br>  put yourself in the best light by publishing resume profiles where they show their <br>  merit.  Recruiters and HR employees love to visit these sites for searching. <br>  candidates for the position.  Benefits of finding employees for your company <br>  It is in these networks that are obvious: <br>  - You are watching a summary of people selected only by their criteria, sifting out <br>  "garbage".  Reduced time for correspondence with the applicant and a request from him <br>  resume does not take much time.  Also, HR department employees do not need to spend <br>  time to decrypt outlandish file formats in which job seekers often <br>  send your resumes.  It is very easy to catalog found in the network itself, <br>  ‚Äúfavorites‚Äù, tags and many other tools are at your disposal. <br>  - Correspondence by internal network mail guarantees delivery of the message to the participant <br>  network.  Your email will not be eaten by spam filter. <br>  - Professional networking groups will allow you to ‚Äúhear‚Äù your candidate <br>  before the interview, see how competently and professionally he puts and <br>  answers questions posed by other network members. <br>  In addition, in these networks you can check how loyal the employee is. <br>  your company, for example, before a potential increase.  Offer him anonymously <br>  higher salary and - watch the reaction. <br><br>  <b>Special purpose networks</b> <br>  These networks usually serve to improve communications in very geographically <br>  separated and crowded companies.  In such networks it is convenient to discuss informally. <br>  setting plans and new ideas, as well as planning meetings and preparing <br>  to events.  Communication in such a network does not mix with messages in systems <br>  project management and service e-mail, which allows you to separate the formal and informal <br>  communication  Employees of the companies in which corporate social networks are introduced, <br>  usually very warmly about these initiatives.  Especially since they divert <br>  attention of staff from public social networks and further motivate <br>  stay exactly in your company where there are so many virtual friends to whom <br>  upon dismissal, access will naturally be closed!  Negative sides of what <br>  your staff "sits" in the "social": <br>  The most important "evil" is the huge time spent on this pastime. <br>  Employees take time exclusively from the working ‚Äúeight-hour‚Äù. <br>  Next, you need to remember that networks are often infested with corporate secrets, which <br>  rendered by staff on special or negligence.  Delete this information <br>  subsequently very difficult.  Also the presence of such networks and profiles of your staff <br>  they increase staff turnover - recruiters of competitors are not asleep and, more than <br>  The profile of your employee is accurate, the more contacts with recruiters it produces. <br>  Be alert! <br>  <b>Conclusion</b> <br>  Social networks are the greatest blessing of the modern Internet and very big <br>  danger.  Only competent corporate policy on work bans / permits <br>  in this environment in the near future will play a decisive role in what level of loyalty <br>  to the company will be your employees. <br>  Wired Magazine put the ‚Äúunlocked‚Äù social networks in the workplace the same <br>  important motivational tool like adequate salary and convenience of location <br>  office. <br>  <i>The article is written using materials from <a href="http://docs.google.com/Present%3Fdocid%3Ddhq9hnhm_563cnj9mqdc">Igor</a></i> <i><a href="http://docs.google.com/Present%3Fdocid%3Ddhq9hnhm_563cnj9mqdc"><br></a></i>  <i><a href="http://docs.google.com/Present%3Fdocid%3Ddhq9hnhm_563cnj9mqdc">Osadchy and PRO2 teams</a></i> <br>  Vyacheslav Baransky <br>  <strong>Source: <u><a href="http://roiber.ru/articles/10">Royber PC</a></u></strong> <br></habracut></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/25132/">https://habr.com/ru/post/25132/</a></p>
