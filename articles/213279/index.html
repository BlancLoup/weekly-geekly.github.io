Well, you know, there - ‚Äúget a driver's license‚Äù, ‚Äúlearn speed reading‚Äù and other dregs in the style of business youth.  Among the list was one strange tip - learn how to program. <br><br>  Then I thought it was idiotic.  It even made me angry.  I was well versed in programming and considered this skill elitist and not for everyone.  Locksmith fitter, so to speak.  But today, flying somewhere Barnaul-Moscow over the Urals, and sorting out the files prepared for me by one employee, with a bunch of small shoals, logical inconsistencies and shortcomings, it dawned on him: he simply does not see cause-and-effect relationships and does not pay attention to trivia.  Because he was never taught this!

      Learn any programming language. <br><br>  <b>What for?</b> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  First of all, it will <strong>exacerbate the feeling of cause-effect relationships.</strong> <br>  In the second - the ability to program <strong>teaches us to pay attention to the little things.</strong> <br><br>  Both of these aspects - and a heightened sense of cause-and-effect relationships, and attention to trifles - is a damn useful thing.  In all branches of life.  From communication with people (when we can calculate the consequences of our actions for a few steps, if our picture of the world is adequate, and the logic is perfect).  To the ability to quickly understand the principles of operation of complex devices. <br><br>  The ability to pay attention to the little things (until they turned into big problems) is perfectly brought up by the debugger (debugger of programs).  In our character there is something that constantly pushes any work to throw on the draft.  Big strokes.  And, losing interest, not finished by 95%, quit.  Or leave to fine-tune another, and go ahead yourself, ‚Äúengage in global things.‚Äù  That is why the world around us strongly pereklinilo, and so not enough of those who know how to bring the matter to the end. <br><br>  And it is attention to detail that distinguishes a mature person from a child.  You will be welcome in any company if you develop these two qualities in yourself. <br><br>  What language?  It is difficult to make recommendations.  Technologies change almost every 4 months.  But do not spray power.  There is no goal to master all technologies (if you are not a programmer).  There is a <strong>goal to pump the feeling of cause-effect relationships and attention to detail.</strong>  If I started today, it would probably be JavaScript / Node.JS. <br><br>  To what level to study.  It's also not easy.  There were a lot of ‚Äúnovice programmers‚Äù who learned to ‚Äúput Jumla and slightly change the template for themselves‚Äù.  Unfortunately, nobody needs this level.  Especially for yourselves. <br><br>  Learn the language to a level where you can write on it on a piece of paper any process of the real world.  <strong>It is on a piece of paper (without constant typing into the debugging window and prompts of a smart text editor).</strong>  When it comes, when you learn to think in a formal language, follow the logical connections - the goal will be achieved. <br><br>  It may take you six months of intensive work on yourself.  But your shares in the labor market will increase greatly. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/213279/">https://habr.com/ru/post/213279/</a></p>
