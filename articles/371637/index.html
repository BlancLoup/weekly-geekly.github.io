  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Nubia My Prague: the subtle soul of strong nature</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  We never thought that we would write these words to Geektimes, but geeks are not alien to romance.  The degree of which, according to commercial calculations, will certainly increase with the approach of February 14.  Anyway, the holiday was finally registered among the Russian traditions, and our loved ones are waiting for nice surprises, even if they don‚Äôt give an appearance and in every way express dissatisfaction with this day.  And of course, there is no better attribute for expressing feelings than a smartphone: instant messengers, letters, pictures, joint selfies, immediately installed love story, music and, of course, short calls and long conversations.  Our team plunged into a heap of new products and chose three smartphones that can be a good gift.  And we begin with a review of the thin and truly sophisticated phone from Nubia. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/286/1b2/69a/2861b269ac9ac448d7dff263fc576962.png"></div><a name="habracut"></a><br>  ZTE is the second largest telecommunications equipment manufacturer in China and definitely knows a lot about mobile technology.  Under its sub-brand Nubia in 2015, the company released several interesting smartphones that followed the flagship Nubia Z9.  Among the new products, <a href="http://acen.jd.com/ru/activities/nubia.html">Nubia My Prague</a> stands out the most, for which the manufacturer chose the slogan ‚ÄúWhen a smartphone intersects with art‚Äù (When smartphone comes across art).  Whether these words are true, we will tell a little lower, but for now - more to the point. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#c30023">Where it is thin, there is discharged</font> </h2><br>  The smartphone turned out to be thin (only 5.5 mm) and at the same time durable - the back panel and frame are made of aluminum.  At the same time, the diagonal of the device is 5.2 ", so there is nothing to please fans of smaller phones. However, this size is fully justified by the display quality: super AMOLED matrix, Full HD resolution (1920x1080 pixels), oleophobic coverage. You can even watch videos and photos in bright light - the screen does not fade, the image remains sharp.In Nubia My Prague uses glass 2.5D (curved glass), due to which ZTE was able to implement FiT technology (as in the flagship Z9), which makes it possible to control several functions using gestures and prik  snoveny to the edges of the screen.

      <a href="http://acen.jd.com/ru/activities/nubia.html">The smartphone</a> has two slots for SIM-cards (one for nano, the second for micro).  By the way, the slot for nano-SIM is simultaneously a slot for a microSD memory card up to 128 GB.  So either more memory or two SIM cards and cloud storage.  They call it a multifunctional slot design. <br><br>  Of course, that 5.5 mm thickness is not able to accommodate some kind of super battery, so the Li-Pol battery is quite average - 2,200 mAh.  Talk time: in GSM and WCDMA networks - 27 hours, standby time - 426 hours.  True, the manufacturer promises fast charging technology - 25% of the battery in 10 minutes. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#c30023">Performance characteristics</font> </h2><br><blockquote>  <b>Size:</b> 147.8 x 72.1 x 5.5 mm <br>  <b>Works in networks</b> : GSM: 850/900/1800/1900 MHz;  3G: WCDMA 850/900/1900/2100 MHz, TD-SCDMA B34 / B39;  4G: FDD-LTE B1 / B3 / B7, TD-LTE B38 / B39 / B40 / B41. <br>  <b>Processor:</b> Qualcomm Snapdragon 615 MSM8939, 4 cores 1.5 GHz and 4 cores 1 GHz. <br>  Memory: 2 GB of RAM, internal memory of the device 16 GB. <br>  <b>Operating system:</b> Android 5.1 Lollipop with Nubia UI 3.0 interface.  The interface is a proprietary shell with a flat design, implemented without using the application menu - shortcuts are placed on desktops. <br>  <b>CPU:</b> Quad-core 1.5 GHz Cortex-A53 &amp; quad-core 1.0 GHz Cortex-A53. <br>  <b>GPU:</b> Adreno 405 <br>  <b>Sound:</b> AK4375 Hi-Fi audio chip with Dolby Surround 7.1 sound for music.  You need to tell about it separately - the quality of the music being played will please almost everyone.  If something is missing and you need custom settings, you can use the equalizer. <br>  <b>Main camera:</b> 13 Mpx, f / 2.2 lens, ISOCELL technology, Neo Vision 5.2 camera system, autofocus, optical stabilization, 4160 x 3120 px resolution, LED flash (also a flashlight).  Geotagging, face recognition, panorama mode - included. <br>  <b>Front camera:</b> 8 Mpx, lens with a f / 2.4 aperture, resolution 3264 x 2448 px. <br>  <b>Other features:</b> proximity sensors, light, gravity, digital compass. </blockquote><br>  In general, if you describe the parameters of the phone in one word, they are scattered: something from the flagship model, something very average.  But in general, it turned out a good model, honed for entertainment.  With this screen and sound, you can quite comfortably watch movies and concerts, and with the camera you can shoot something of your own.  No wonder the manufacturer focuses on the photo-capabilities of Nubia My Prague. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#c30023">So what about art?</font> </h2><br>  In the case of <a href="http://acen.jd.com/ru/activities/nubia.html">Nubia My Prague,</a> we are talking about the art of photography.  In addition to a good camera, the manufacturers equipped the smartphone with a convenient photo editor, in which interesting filters are available.  Of course, in the style of old Prague, namely in the style of the Czech artist Alphonse Mucha.  That is, photos can look vintage and stylish.  Like that: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/81d/50a/1b2/81d50a1b22893cdac270b8055eb16069.jpg"><br><br>  Or even like this: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/db2/e9d/795/db2e9d79583df0077d33e89d6571d06c.jpg"><br><br>  In addition to the Fly-filter, the smartphone is equipped with many tricks for selfie lovers: <br><br><ul><li>  instant photo editing: skin lightening and smoothing, face slimming (it‚Äôs hard to translate this desired word combination - the cheek reduction will probably be the most accurate); <br><br></li><li>  shooting a series of ten images with one click with a choice of the best photo; <br><br></li><li>  eight built-in "beauty" filters. </li></ul><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/484/c82/93b/484c8293b1d94322860231cded2078d7.jpg"><br><br>  Additionally, on the left side of the smartphone has a special button for selfie.  They say that this is done according to the rule ‚ÄúLeft Self is more beautiful‚Äù.  What you will not know from mobile marketers! <br><br>  In general, you probably already guessed who the target audience for Nubia My Prague is.  If this audience overlaps with yours, then we are pleased to announce that the smartphone is now available for purchase in Russia.  The cost of <a href="http://acen.jd.com/ru/activities/nubia.html">Nubia My Prague</a> when buying on JD.ru is <b>239.99 USD</b> .  As part of sales for this model, a special coupon discount of <b>30 USD</b> will be valid.  Service available in service centers of Russia.  A complete list of SCs is on <a href="http://www.jd.ru/product/999255.html">the</a> smartphone <a href="http://www.jd.ru/product/999255.html">description page</a> . <br><br>  Finally a couple of teasers.  Very soon we will talk about the budget smartphone, which has its very interesting style and good performance characteristics.  And finally, the third review will be devoted to a rather brutal smartphone, which has something to measure with the rest.  Just for the strong half of the target audience.  In general, coming soon ... </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/371637/">https://habr.com/ru/post/371637/</a></p>
