  <section class="page js-page"><h1>A study that can show that the Universe is a computer simulation</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Scientists say that if the Universe is a simulation product, then we will see clues in high-energy cosmic rays. <br>  One of the most cherished ideas in modern physics, quantum chromodynamics, a theory that describes a strong interaction, how it binds quarks and gluons into protons and neutrons.  This is the foundation of the universe. <br><br>  Thus, an interesting goal is to simulate quantum chromodynamics on a computer to see what happens at the macro level.  Simulation at this level should be more or less equivalent to the simulation of the universe itself. <br><br>  Of course, there are one or two problems along the way.  Quantum chromodynamics is morally composable and operates with calculations on a Planck scale.  Therefore, even using the most powerful supercomputers in the world, physicists can simulate only small pieces of space measuring several femtometers (10 ^ -15).

      It does not sound impressive, but it is important that such a simulation is almost indistinguishable from what is happening in reality (at least as far as we understand it). <br><br>  It is not so difficult to imagine that progress like Moore's law will allow physicists to simulate much larger parts of the universe.  Areas with a size of only a few micrometers in diameter can accommodate the complete work of a human cell. <br><br>  And again, the work of the simulated cell will be indistinguishable from the real one. <br><br>  Such reflections lead to the possibility that our universe is running on a super powerful computer.  And if so, is it possible to check it? <br><br>  Today we received in some way a response from Silas Binet from the University of Bonn in Germany, and his colleagues.  They say that there is an opportunity to find manifestations of the simulation of our universe, at least in some scenarios. <br><br>  For a start, a little introduction.  The problem of any simulation is that the laws of physics, which are essentially continuous, in the simulation are superimposed on a discrete three-dimensional lattice, the state of which changes over time. <br><br>  Binet and colleagues asked whether the lattice constraints would lead to some kind of constraints on the physical processes of our universe.  In particular, they checked the high-energy processes that affect smaller parts of the space while their energy increases. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Their find is interesting, they say that the lattice imposes a restriction on the possible energy of the particle.  This follows from the fact that there can be nothing smaller than the grating step. <br><br>  So, if our universe is a simulation, there must be a cutoff in the spectrum of high-energy particles. <br><br>  In fact, there is just such a cutoff in the energies of cosmic particles, the Grain ‚Äì Zatsepin ‚Äì Kuzmin (GZK) constraint. <br><br>  This cutoff is well studied and comes from the interaction of particles with cosmic microradiation, from which they lose energy over long distances. <br><br>  However, Bine associates have calculated that the lattice will add additional features to the spectrum.  "The most striking feature ... is that the angular distribution of the most high-energy components will exhibit cubic symmetry, significantly deviating from isotropy." <br><br>  In other words, cosmic rays will fly predominantly along their lattice, and we should not observe them in equal shares in all directions. <br><br>  It is cool and brainwashing.  However, the calculations of Binet &amp; co are not without flaws, for example, the lattice can be built entirely according to other principles, not by what Binet suggested. <br><br>  Still, this effect can only be measured if the cutoff is similar to GZK.  This will be at a lattice step of 10 ^ -12 femtometers.  If the step is much smaller than this, we will not see anything. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/154373/">https://habr.com/ru/post/154373/</a></p>
