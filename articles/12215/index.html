  <section class="page js-page"><h1>About piracy, windows and lies</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  I am very ashamed that I myself do not write such long articles, but I could not post it here. <br>  I rested with newsland.ru, and I don't know where they come from.  Many-many bukav. <br><br>  If Microsoft, a monopolist in the global computer software market, were a monopolist in the automotive market, your car would break down twice a day, for no apparent reason.  And sometimes would stop all of a sudden.  And you, without being surprised at all, started the engine again and drove on. <a name="habracut"></a><br>  From time to time, after some maneuver, the car would be gloh tightly and would never start.  So I would have to change the engine.  With each update of the dividing lanes on the pavement, it would be necessary to buy a new car.  The machine would have the right to use only one person.  All devices showing the temperature of the water, oil pressure and the amount of fuel would have been replaced with one light bulb warning: "Something broke somewhere."  Before the airbags triggered, the car would ask: ‚ÄúAre you sure?‚Äù  Sometimes, all of a sudden, they would shut the doors tightly, and you could only open the car by doing this trick: simultaneously pressing the door knob, turning the key and shaking the antenna.  The driver is obliged to regularly buy insanely expensive road maps, even if he does not need them.  And if you dare not to buy, the power of the car will immediately be halved.  Every time Microsoft launches a new car model, drivers would have to take an exam and get new rights, because everything would be different in the new car and the old skills wouldn't suit.  To drown out the engine, you should press the 'Start' button. <br><br>  Bill Gates - few who, except Kwasniewski, saw him alive - have a brain (and software for it).  The mind that he now uses, Bill received in the womb of his mother, either by accident, or not, but, in any case, free of charge.  This freebie made him the richest man in the history of the universe.  And despite such exclusivity, Gates demonstrates the most ordinary hypocrisy, arguing that if he had not been paid for the work, he would have done the same thing anyway.  The products of its activities, he appreciates very highly.  But he promises that before he dies, out of his vast wealth, he will leave a million to his daughter, and will leave the rest to charity.

      It may happen that a person bites a dog, and another person steals a bicycle in a supermarket, hiding it in an iron box.  Newspapers will sound about such incredible events, although, in essence, there is nothing unusual in the fact that everything happens in life, including perverts who can eat a glass.  However, if it turned out that 61 percent of people of working age suddenly began to bite dogs or rob supermarkets on a regular basis, the problem would be so serious that it would have to be closely examined, maybe even by special decree of the parliament to remove the ‚Äútheft in the supermarket‚Äù list of criminal offenses. <br><br>  Bill Gates is the same person who is robbed by 61 percent of humanity.  It doesn't matter America or Poland, Germany or France;  the number of gates robbers ranges from 38 to 93 (Vietnam) percent, and compatriots rob Gates more often than Poles. <br><br>  I am absolutely sure that the use of pirated software is theft.  But in the case of computer theft, the perpetrators are too numerous not to look for the causes of this gangrene and on the other side of the counter - among the sellers.  Because the modern world cannot exist without computers, including those that are included in these 61 percent completely legal, but with pirated software.  If there were no pirates, the world would not look as good as it looks now, despite all the evil.  The epidemic of dishonesty among ordinary users causes a hidden and very difficult to identify the dishonesty of rich software vendors.  The rich have the advantage that a tiny fraud brings them billions in profits, and a poor crime - at best, housing and food in a government house at the expense of the state. <br><br>  First, manufacturers are lying, claiming that they lose about $ 17 billion annually because of piracy, and over the course of a decade, because they don‚Äôt earn what they would have earned had they sold the software.  There is still the difference between losing and not earning. <br><br>  Another lie is the statement that piracy is a source of unemployment, ostensibly because those who are currently unemployed could get it by selling software legally.  Apparently, these are the very people who are now pirating, and could work for the firm 'Microsoft'.  But even if the company accepted them - what it supposedly wants - then they would have no one to sell the Microsoft programs, unless they would have stolen them. <br><br>  If someone does not have money for pants for 200 zlotys, let him buy for 40. I agree with that.  But software is not pants.  The main software package costs about 1,500 zlotys (about - because Microsoft-Poland is owned by Microsoft American, which is 25 percent owned by Bill Gates. This company does not indicate anywhere how much the software package costs, which means that the company does not lead to Poland trading activity, or conducts it, violating our laws).  Such a package may cost, for example, 600 zlotys - who knows.  It seems to me personally that this is the case, because programs of about the same complexity, for example, computer games sold by much smaller circuits, cost the same or less. <br><br>  Microsoft unscrupulously admits that its products are expensive, that is, they are sold much higher than their real price, precisely because of piracy.  It's a lie.  Firms involved in information technology, in today's difficult times are the most profitable enterprises on Earth, and if not piracy, they would have been even richer.  Indecent prices of software are determined only by greed and conscious lies of manufacturers. <br><br>  If there were no piracy, how much would Microsoft have to spend on advertising, for which practically nothing is currently being spent?  On the one hand, the evil pirates: skinheads, in leather jackets and sweatpants, followed by the police;  on the other hand, robbed engineers with glasses, pale and suffering from a curvature of the spine.  How many such articles you have already read!  Billions would have to spend paying television time and space on the pages of popular magazines to achieve such incredible popularity! <br><br>  Selling legal computers with legal software is absolute paranoia.  Such a computer is worth, say, 1960 zloty.  The programs installed in it can be legally purchased for 1600 zlotys.  Computer without software - 1550 z≈Ç.  A simple-minded person who thinks with primitive logic will calculate and understand that someone is fooling someone here. <br><br>  Because it turns out that: either the software actually costs 360 zlotys, or the well-known retailers sell us stolen computer hardware, or Microsoft simply does not want ordinary people to buy what they need in the usual way. <br><br>  It is enough to look into one of the gates stores, for example, 'Computer Plus' in Krakow.  And you find out that the Windows Pro 2000 Polish CVUP AE operating system, which is absolutely no different from the Windows Pro 2000 Polish PUP CD system, which exactly repeats the Windows Pro 2000 Polish VUP CD system - in essence, is the Windows Pro 2000 Polish CD system .  And then you feel like a complete idiot, finding that these are exactly the same systems, respectively: 623, 1063, 722 and 1523 zlotys. <br><br>  Either the composers of these prices are fools, or they take advantage of our lack of information for their own illegal enrichment, which in Poland is still considered a crime.  Simply put - do not hang us noodles on the ears, gentlemen! <br><br>  If it came to a fight, and the gentlemen, who mutually accuse each other of violating the physical integrity of the person, appear before the court, the court, in order to assess the degree of guilt of each, initiates an investigation - who gave the first to whom.  If we investigate the conflict between Microsoft and the rest of the world, then Bill Gates gave us in the face first and not once, and still continues to do it.  Having invented Windows, he undoubtedly served to general progress, however, he also spawned pirates with his insane greed.  I hate piracy, but I also want to send Bill Gates to me very far, but I can‚Äôt do that because I depend on his programs.  But I can send every cop from Gorzhov, who will come to my home looking for traces of a crime. <br><br>  It's funny that every time, as in this text (created in a program legally purchased from Bill Gates), the words 'Bill Gates' or 'Microsoft' appeared, the program informs that there are no such words in the dictionary and there are no suggestions for their spelling correct writing. <br>  Robert Yaruga <br><br><br>  After this article in my head everything sorted out on the shelves.  Thanks to Robert.  It is immoral to talk about piracy, when you are the richest person on earth.  Thanks to all)). </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/12215/">https://habr.com/ru/post/12215/</a></p>
