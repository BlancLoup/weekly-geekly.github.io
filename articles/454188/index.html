  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Alternative recruitment channels</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The article will discuss alternative channels of personnel search, as one of the solutions to the problem of staff shortage and the peculiarities of working with this solution. <br><br>  Modern trends in the development of society are aimed at accelerating a person‚Äôs life, and the ways of communication and interaction between people are changing.  Do not lag behind this trend and the channels of interaction of potential candidates with the employer.  If a recruiter wants to maintain his efficiency, quickly find high-quality personnel, he should remain in the trend of the latest trends.  More clearly the problem can be represented as follows (Fig. 1): <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/le/gy/go/legygorklqa619pd2zmuffflo3s.jpeg">

      Imagine that you or your recruitment managers use all the well-known classical recruitment channels that are conditionally classified as category A. But due to the emergence of new communication channels and the rapid change in the information environment, new recruitment channels appear that we categorize B and C. It is logical to assume that the efficiency will be higher for a recruiter who uses all three categories of search channels.  The ratio of the volume of search channels is represented in the figure conditionally to demonstrate the general meaning. <br><br>  I myself (like my colleagues from other companies) have repeatedly encountered the problem of staff shortages, and alternative selection channels serve as a very good solution.  But this does not mean that you need to urgently look for alternative channels of recruitment (of which there are quite a lot at the moment, and they are becoming more frequent), since this solution has certain conditions. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  In which case the alternative recruitment channels will be the solution to the shortage of personnel? <br><br>  Let's take a closer look at other facets of this problem.  Many managers, when they learn about new methods of work or ways to increase efficiency, intrusively try to implement them in their company / department, without understanding the essence of the issue and the nuances (limitations) of applying these solutions.  Therefore, the first question to ask yourself in front of the study and use of alternative recruitment channels is ‚Äúwhy?‚Äù. <br><br><ol><li>  Do you have a problem with the selection of high-quality staff on time or is it likely that such a problem will appear in the foreseeable future (launch of a new project, other prospects for expanding the company)?  It is important to answer this question, because when working with different channels of recruitment, the recruiter spends time on additional work (creating accounts to work with new channels, posting vacancies, monitoring different channels, working with responses from different channels), which is directly proportional to the number of channels recruitment.  If at the current moment you have no problems with recruitment, then using alternative channels of selection will be ineffective.  The exception is the situation when this work is being done to improve the recruiter's professionalism, or for the unforeseen event when the unexpected appearance of a staff shortage in the company is possible. </li><li>  If the answer to this question is positive, and you have a problem with recruitment in the company, then the next step is understanding what the problem is.  The most classic and effective method for determining the problem of selection is the study of the selection funnel.  Perhaps the problem with recruitment is not related to recruitment channels, and connecting alternative recruitment channels will not bring you closer to solving the problem, but will only exacerbate the situation, since the recruiter will waste time on ineffective actions. </li></ol><br>  Alternative recruitment channels <br><br>  So, you have come to the conclusion that there is a problem with recruitment, and it is concentrated around the recruitment channels.  Let's define the terms and conditionally divide the recruitment channels into several categories (the division is very subjective and is offered by me personally). <br><br><h4>  Category A </h4><br>  Under this category will be the "traditional" channels of recruitment, such as work sites, advertising in the media under the relevant headings, recommendations from colleagues and acquaintances, classic platforms that all recruiters have become accustomed to using. <br><br><h4>  Category B </h4><br>  Here we put the channels that were considered new and modern at the time of the formation of the classical theory of recruiting: forums, LinkedIn, social networks, closed professional communities and similar channels. <br><br><h4>  Category C </h4><br>  This should include: <br><br><ol><li>  channels that are considered modern today: mobile applications for job search in geolocation, non-core applications and services that are different from forums and social networks, but which can be used for recruitment (mobile app for dating - Tinder) </li><li>  channels that are, on the one hand, new independent platforms for personnel search, and on the other hand, these are new channels that are integrated into the old personnel search areas and give them alternative access.  The most striking example is the change of the search engine on LinkedIn, the new search system has significantly reduced the recruiters' capabilities and almost blocked access to the channel.  However, in response to these changes, additional services began to appear through which you can search for profiles on LinkedIn in the usual mode.  There are similar services for searching developer profiles on the professional GitHub site.  The site was not originally intended for communication and job search, it does not have a rubric for posting vacancies, but thanks to the use of additional services, this site can also become a source for recruiting.  The official chat bot has appeared on the social network VKontakte, which is engaged in staff recruitment.  Another very large and powerful modern channel is instant messengers.  Users of instant messengers, like smartphone users, became elementary in terms of the number more than a few years ago.  On the one hand, messengers form their large platforms for personnel search, on the other hand, various professional communities pass to messengers, to which, thanks to messengers, recruiters' access is simplified (Telegram will be the most striking examples in this area for Russia). </li></ol><br>  The diagram below presents data on recruitment channels, in one of the offices of the company in which I work, for 2018. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/p0/u9/2g/p0u92ger6ncrepadrsk3bywmsps.jpeg" alt="image"><br><br>  The office is engaged in software development, it employs highly qualified specialists in the field of IT.  Over the year, the office has more than doubled, the growth of staff by the beginning of the year was 239%.  Category C channels were used only when Category A and B channels failed. <br><br>  Alternative channels of personnel search are a powerful, but very changeable tool in solving the problem of staff shortages.  Given the demographic pits and the deterioration of education, the problem of shortage of personnel and competition for them is very acute.  The study of alternative channels of personnel search is a very extensive area, and for large companies with high competition for personnel, this area is of particular value.  In such companies, it would be expedient and efficient to allocate research of alternative channels of personnel selection in a separate direction, just as in a separate area of ‚Äã‚Äãmarketing will allocate the study of alternative sales channels. <cut></cut></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/454188/">https://habr.com/ru/post/454188/</a></p>
