Their business models have already passed the first test of strength and have proven their worth.  If you want to try to create something similar in Russia, treat the components of the business model especially carefully! <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  So here they are:

The project, whose task is to improve the process of "sharing" the screen.  Wasted away that if you want to see what is happening on another screen, you just click on the link: a couple of seconds - and you're done!  It‚Äôs not much more difficult to share your screen: to do this, simply install a Java applet.  In addition, the application runs on mobile devices!  By the way, two of their project founders created Steamtunnels, the forerunner of Facebook, when they were studying at Stanford 13 years ago.  Screenleap has reached 100,000 Shair, and their number is growing at an average of 19% per week. <br><br><img align="right" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/57d/4c5/718/57d4c571897145b2dfab169e0048ac1d.jpg" alt="image">  <a href="http://anyperk.com/">AnyPerk</a> is another graduate of Y Combinator, offering start-ups and small companies an easy way to increase the number of benefits for employees.  The AnyPerks platform combines various discounts and promotions for users.  The creators say that 90% of the $ 5 billion discount industry consists of start-ups and small companies, but the market as a whole is not functioning well enough, because existing operators cannot find the right interaction model. <br>  AnyPerks is currently working with small companies and plans to eventually move to work with large clients.  At the moment, the platform is used by more than 2000 customers. <br><br><img align="right" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/390/a56/20c/390a5620c97ca323fe975de2873a5428.jpg" alt="image">  <a href="http://www.ratemydrawings.com/chat/">DrawChat</a> - as the name implies, is an application for drawing and chat.  Given the small size of the screens of mobile devices, the pictures do not look the best (those who have tried it will understand), but they still allow you to visualize the correspondence.  One of the founders of the project, Y Combinator graduate Gabor Cselle, says that he wanted to create something ‚Äúquick and fun.‚Äù  He also hinted that this is only a trial version of the project, and this ‚Äúidea for a million‚Äù is preparing for launch. <br><br><img align="right" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/72a/ce3/072/72ace3072f5a7779f190a75a1bcf3c14.jpg" alt="image">  <a href="http://www.bitdeli.com/">BitDeli</a> is a platform for processing and storing data in real time.  As conceived by the creators of the project, the system tracks "data that is relevant to your business - including what is important to you personally."  Clients write BitDeli TK for analytics and visualization, after which the company takes over the entire data processing process. <br>  <a href="https://bitdeli.com/explore">Sample scripts</a> . <br><br>  The company claims that analytics is currently divided into two different types: there are unique custom products built for large enterprises, and there are global turnkey solutions like Google Analytics.  BitDeli meets the needs of those who want something average, but high-quality and inexpensive.  To illustrate how easy it is to create a custom dashboard, a product was shown that was created in less than 30 minutes and consisted of less than 100 lines of Python code. <br><br><img align="right" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/9db/ca9/e36/9dbca9e36ae58949e06274a2f61b052b.jpg" alt="image">  <a href="http://www.gameface.me/">GameFace.me</a> - a platform that combines the game and data from social networks.  For example, instead of saving a virtual princess, you can fight for your beloved girlfriend, and instead of zombies you can shoot at your colleagues or friends.  The creators launched a concept project ZombieFace, after which they noticed 65% of user outflows the next day and 20% outflows within a month after users began to use the faces of friends instead of zombies. <br><br><img align="right" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/574/448/6d7/5744486d7d3c45ba357406c528850b73.jpg" alt="image">  <a href="http://www.socialpandas.com/">SocialPandas</a> - converts contacts in social networks into potential customers.  Recently, True Ventures invested about $ 1.5 million in them. At the moment, the company received about 1000 requests for access to the working version, and it plans to launch the product in 2013. <br><br><img align="right" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/fc9/8ec/53a/fc98ec53a43cf438541224ef5cd749f1.jpg" alt="image">  <a href="http://www.streak.com/">Streak</a> is a CRM system for Gmail that allows you to transfer used email to databases, sorting them into various categories.  The project is also a graduate of Y Combinator. <br><br>  But that is not all!  There are three more projects, but information about them is still classified.  Here is all that we know about them: <br><br>  <a href="http://www.rescale.com/">Rescale</a> - A platform for modeling cloud systems. <br><br>  <a href="http://mecommerce.co/">MeCommerce</a> - Fashionable brand of the new generation <br><br>  <a href="http://www.peek.com/">Peek</a> is a project for those who want to discover exciting new travels. <br><br>  So, we have presented to your attention projects that have achieved no small success in the western market. <br>  And what do you think, which of them can be adapted to Russian reality? </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/151948/">https://habr.com/ru/post/151948/</a></p>
