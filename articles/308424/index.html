We have already told on Habr√© ( <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/npl/blog/252589/">here</a> and <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/npl/blog/251675/">here</a> ) what we specifically learn, what knowledge and skills our graduates come out of, and very soon we will write what will be new in the fifth program.  And today we want to share the stories and reviews of those who have already been trained and have experienced all the hardships and hardships themselves. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a52/f0d/5c9/a52f0d5c9d574f5c854fcc488668b8df.jpg" alt="image"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b>Sergey Zemelkin, Sberbank, Applied Data Center, Project Director:</b> <br><br>  ‚ÄúFor me, the program was a test.  I did not use programming in my work and was far from understanding what python, spark, Hadoop and so on are.  Once I was a good programmer at pascal in the university, and that was the hope of the possibility of mastering the course program.

      The program took almost all my free time at once and did not let go until the very end.  New topics for me that are rapidly falling down and insidious laboratory work forced the brain to accelerate.  I felt a pleasant feeling of gaining new knowledge. <br><br>  In addition to the knowledge, the course gave me an excellent opportunity to meet with teachers who practice big data analysis in their work.  With some of them, we are now working on projects. <br><br>  We also had a wonderful class of interesting people on the course.  With some we found common themes.  We maintain friendly relations with some.  After the course I gained a great feeling of elbow, that you are not alone in this world of big data and you can always count on the help of colleagues. <br><br>  Now I work at Sberbank in a new division that deals with the monetization of bank data.  We are solving interesting and new tasks for the bank and, of course, the New Professions Lab, was one of the good reasons for my joining Sberbank. ‚Äù <br><br>  <b>Kristina Fedorenko, Mail.Ru Group, programmer:</b> <br><br>  ‚ÄúBefore newprolab, I already had sufficient training in the field of BigData.  Therefore, I had fears that it would be boring or useless.  They did not materialize.  After the course, I began to better understand how the hadoop infrastructure worked.  How data is stored in hbase, how pigs work, hive, how hdfs works.  I was fascinated by the topic of processing natural languages, partly because of this, I later changed jobs.  I really liked the lectures of Peter Yermakov, Alexander Petrov and Vladimir Lesnichenko, I thank them very much for them.  The second part of the course was devoted to advisory systems.  About her, I do not have such a good impression.  Maybe because the New Year bustle did not allow them to fully immerse themselves.  But in my head there was almost nothing.  All people who make newprolab want to say thank you for your work.  Grow, reach new heights. ‚Äù <br><br>  <b>Artem Moskvin, E-Contenta, data engineer:</b> <br><br>  ‚ÄúI am delighted with the program.  Today, this is probably the key moment in my professional career.  After graduation I worked in the field of IT for about 4 years.  But since I had a business education, I was mainly engaged in the business part of companies.  However, all this time I was drawn precisely to the engineering side.  It turned out not so easy to expand their careers.  To begin with, I could not even choose the direction of development: the web, mobile or something else.  As a result, I began to try, to take various online courses.  Then on one of the resources I saw the so-called nano-degrees (nanodegree), among which was the direction of Data Analysis.  The term Big Data had just become a buzzword, so it became interesting to me, and I decided to try.  From the first classes I fell in love with this direction.  As it turned out, I had a good background: I graduated from HSE, so I was doing well with math, and one of the courses I had taken earlier was just on Python.  In the same breath, I took a course for a course, and suddenly I saw on Facebook news about the set in NewProLab.  I could not miss this opportunity. <br><br>  I never got the Nano Degree at Udacity, because all my free time I began to go to study at NewProLab.  Lectures, homework, labs ... I really liked it very much, I just caught the buzz from writing code, solving technical problems, catching and still My friends lost sight of me for 3 months, but I found myself. <br><br>  At the end of the program, I had planned a vacation, so I finished the program remotely.  By that time, we were already talking to Slak with might and main, so there were no communication problems.  However, during the holidays, the last 2 labs just fell out ... I will never forget those sultry days and sleepless nights spent in co-working in Bali. When everyone skates, have fun, have a rest, and I think I recommend Spark at that time. of my main tools in the new job. <br><br>  About the vacancy in E-Contenta, Sasha Petrov (now a HUNDRED in E-Contenta) told us in one of the cases.  I immediately decided to respond.  I am very close in spirit to the topic of startups, and I realized that I don‚Äôt really want to enter an enterprise.  We talked with the rest of the founders, Zoya and Kolya, liked each other and decided to give me a test task.  I proceeded to him just after the labs had finished doing it in Bali. That is, I was stuck in co-working for another week.  Sasha accepted this task from me 3 days before departure.  As a result, after spending half a holiday in co-working, I returned to be quite a happy man.  Ahead of me was waiting for a new career and moving to St. Petersburg. <br><br>  I have been working in E-Contenta for 9 months.  We are engaged in personalization at all stages of the marketing funnel: personalized advertising, recommendation systems, personalized mailing lists, etc.  During this time, I managed to participate in the development of a real-time recommendation engine, implemented just in Spark Streaming, as well as write and launch in DSP production.  But the biggest reward for me was an invitation as a speaker in NewProLab.  From the very beginning, I was interested in the processing speed, so I was pretty well pumped into the topic of stream processing.  It is about her that I tell the case to the second after me a set of students in NewProLab.  Sharing knowledge is insanely cool and very important, in my opinion! <br><br>  I am very, very grateful to the organizers and participants of the NewProLab program.  If not for you, I don‚Äôt even know where I would be right now.  From myself, I can wish all future sets: love what you do and do what you love. ‚Äù <br><br>  <b>And now a few numbers:</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/77c/c14/b3e/77cc14b3eafb404fa27498f8be138733.png" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>We conducted a small survey among graduates and found out what was most useful in the program.</b> <br><br>  Laboratory work ranked first - 87.5% of graduates indicated them, second place was shared by lectures and seminars - 58.3% and 62.5% respectively, and the third place - communication with speakers, this option was chosen by 54.2% of respondents . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/451/9c1/399/4519c13994aa40558c1fd534d5b90316.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>Do you use in your work something that you learned and learned from our program?</b> <br><br>  In this question - an unequivocal primacy of machine learning (58%), in addition, knowledge of recommender systems (29%), analysis and collection of weblogs (25%), processing of natural language (25%) and Hadoop (25%) were useful. . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b11/743/31e/b1174331ec274880a0a5c05f9e5a4ba2.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>And finally, what categories of specialists would you recommend the program?</b> <br><br>  Our graduates believe that training will be more useful for analysts and developers, and less so for managers.  And indeed, in each set we have about 10% of managers and managers of companies; as a result of training, they can clearly set the task for performers, they have an understanding of how to monetize data and consider efficiency in general. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e9c/b8a/a23/e9cb8aa23ce345fd903b0b0f858388e6.png" alt="image"><br>  <a href="http://newprolab.com/bigdata/%3Futm_source%3Dhabr%26utm_medium%3Dhabr%26utm_campaign%3Dotzyvy">The recruitment</a> program is in full swing; moreover, if you come on the recommendation of a graduate, you will receive a 15% discount. <br><br>  Thank you for your attention and we will be happy to answer your questions. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/308424/">https://habr.com/ru/post/308424/</a></p>
