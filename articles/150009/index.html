  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Purchases within applications depend on the number of applications and games.</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  In-app purchases have become the most popular way for developers to earn money, since most of the top 25 profitable iOS apps are distributed for free.  The British company NaturalMotion earned $ 12 million in a month through purchases made only within the CSR Racing game for iOS, so that micro payments can merge into a broad river of profits. <br><br>  The analyst firm Apsalar took a closer look at the factors that can predict the expenditures made within applications, and more specifically how the number of applications loaded by users affects their usual expenditures. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/a8c/373/d1a/a8c373d1a7811883b1d5bdd2b4448d12.png"><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <i>User budget is limited.</i>  <i>The more paid applications the user has installed, the less likely he is to make a purchase inside the application.</i> 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"

        </script>
      <br>
      Something that could be so guessed: users with a large percentage of paid applications tend to spend less money inside free ones.  Apsalar believes that this is due to the limited budget of users - paid applications serve as the economic equivalent of purchases made within applications. <br><br>  Now, although it is difficult for an individual developer to find out how many applications a particular user has, developers can decide where and how they can cross-promote their work in other games or applications.  So game developers will not be able to cross-promote their free apps in other paid games, if it reduces their chances that the end user will be willing to pay them in virtual currency. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/af8/e10/f2b/af8e10f2bf5257f9659b549be5f53a38.png"><br>  <i>The more applications the user has installed, the more likely he is to make a purchase inside the application.</i>  <i>55% of users who have more than 6 applications installed have made purchases within applications.</i> <br><br>  Then, here is something unexpected - the more applications a consumer has, the more likely he is to spend money inside one of them.  If he has enough money to download a bunch of applications, then they will be enough to make purchases within these applications.  More than half of users who have installed more than 6 applications on their device will spend money on in-app purchases, compared to 6% of those who have only one application.  (Of course, it‚Äôs hard to imagine a person who has fewer than five applications installed on a smartphone). <br><br>  In addition, the more games the user has installed, the higher the likelihood that he will spend money inside the application. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/a38/9b3/445/a389b34453db263bd4f5b02aac4f4ef2.png"><br>  <i>The more gaming applications the user has installed, the higher the likelihood of making purchases within the application.</i>  <i>64% of users who have more than 6 gaming applications, make purchases within these applications.</i> <br><br>  Although, this trend has a downside.  The more applications a user has, the less time he spends in each specific application.  It is logical that if users have dozens of applications, they simply do not have enough free time to spend certain amounts in each of them. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/f21/432/8d2/f214328d2d121e791311784217795a15.png"><br>  <i>The Apsalar study showed a decrease in session duration in the application, in inverse proportion to the number of installed applications.</i> <br><br>  Statistics for this study were obtained from 250 million unique mobile devices and more than 100 billion different user actions taken on the Apsalar network.  The company, which received $ 5.8 million in funding from Thomvest and Battery Ventures, recently launched a service for interaction between application developers who want to select users for targeted promotion of their applications based on their previous activity. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/150009/">https://habr.com/ru/post/150009/</a></p>
