  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Who is a good designer?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  A good designer is worth its weight in gold.  The remaining participants in the production process create the body of the site.  The designer is his soul.  So what should be a designer who proudly calls himself a professional? <br><br>  Must be a little salesman.  Do not blush or stammer while communicating with the customer.  To be able to listen, impartially analyze what he heard and immediately ask the right questions.  A designer, hunched over a computer and not showing the nose from the office, will not be able to present his work. <br><br>  Must be a little typographer.  He is familiar with multi-level headers, text and graphics behavior, line widths, date and number formats, and other nonsense that seems unnecessary at the design stage.  But then it turns out that Constantin Illarionovich of Constantinople did not fit on one line, and there was no one to complain about. <a name="habracut"></a>

      Must be a little designer.  The first grid of the site that the customer sees is the grid proposed in the prototype.  It may be so that the customer will be delighted, and the designer and visitors of the future site will go crazy. <br><br>  Must be a little programmer.  Very often when developing complex projects, it is necessary to take into account that over time they will become even more difficult.  The architecture will come up with a programmer, but based on the prototype of the designer.  If there is no explicit indication that the project will become more complex with time, this will result in many months of reworking the site due to some unintended trifle. <br><br>  Must be a little SEO tool.  Anyone can explain why a sitemap, stupid text on the main and crowded navigation menu - this sucks.  But few people will explain what happened to the thousands of visitors after the alteration of an outdated site. <br><br>  Must be a little content manager.  It is difficult to have an idea about the admins of most modern cms, but it is even more difficult to develop the functionality of these from scratch every time. <br><br>  Must be a competent technical writer.  Excuses like "I make cool prototypes, and let other suckers write technical documentation on them" only in studios specializing in design.  A programmer needs quality technical specifications, and who can write it better than him, the site designer? <br><br>  Must be a little politician.  It makes no sense to convince the customer that he is wrong if the latter pays you money for the realization of the site of your dreams, and not the site-tool for earning.  And, on the other hand, there is no need to agree with all the decisions of interested, but not competent people and silently edit the prototype when it comes to the company's internal projects.  The principle of the golden mean has not been canceled. <br><br>  Should be a little Lermontov and a little Pushkin.  Pushkins are people who, from the first day of the assignment, sit down at the computer and fig, fig, prototype, correcting the result ten times a day.  And the Lermontovs of seven days, five think, and two do everything completely from the first time.  A good designer will not hit any of these extremes. <br><br>  Must be a little mom and a little dad.  A good designer will not abandon his brainchild after the adoption of the prototype and technical specifications.  He will monitor each stage of the development of the site, up to beta testing, eradicating errors and inconsistencies.  After all, who can know more about the project than he? <br><br>  Do you consider yourself a good designer? </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/69030/">https://habr.com/ru/post/69030/</a></p>
