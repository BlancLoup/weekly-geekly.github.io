The 29 richest people on the planet are Americans, about a quarter of the fifty have achieved success in the technology industry.  To get on this list, you need to earn a total of 14.3 billion dollars.  Only a small part of this list was ‚Äúborn with a silver spoon in the mouth,‚Äù many people from scratch created the most expensive companies, including Amazon, Facebook, Oracle. <br><br>  Under the cut - a dozen richest people according to Wealth-X. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/bcd/f65/a64/bcdf65a64ab4f62667fe6d5e05dc6382.png" width="600" alt="image"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  10. Ingvar Kamprad </h4><br>  89-year-old Swedish entrepreneur <a href="https://geektimes.ru/post/259208/">Ingvar Kamprad</a> founded the IKEA store at the age of 17, which became the largest furniture retailer in the world.  In the 1950s, Kamprad saw how an employee of his company unscrewed the legs at the table so that it fit in the car of the buyer - this is how the history of furniture packed in flat boxes began.

      Kamprad's fortune is estimated at $ 39.3 billion, but he continues to use the old chair and car, flies in economy class, stays in low-cost hotels and forces employees to use sheets of paper on both sides. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/5ff/639/8d4/5ff6398d432fa8ec14360291560f9f87.jpg" width="600" alt="image"><br><br><h4>  9. Michael Bloomberg </h4><br>  Businessman Michael Bloomberg is the founder and owner of the Bloomberg news agency.  He began his career at Salomon Brothers, where he led stock trading and was responsible for the operation of information systems.  In 1981, he lost this job after selling Salomon to a new owner, but founded his own company to collect and analyze the financial information of Bloomberg LP.  Later, he himself developed a system for analyzing information for traders and opened a service for trading stocks.  Bloomberg first began using computers in the work of traders in the 1980s. <br><br>  Now the state of Michael Bloomberg is estimated at 42.1 billion dollars. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/8a1/93e/4e5/8a193e4e5be4900bf97a386790913878.jpg" width="600" alt="image"><br><br><h4>  8. Mark Zuckerberg </h4><br>  In 2004, 19-year-old Harvard student Mark Zuckerberg <a href="https://geektimes.ru/post/245356/">opened TheFacebook.com</a> .  After that, Mark dropped out of college and became the head of Facebook, a social network with more than a billion users per day. <br><br>  Facebook is worth 275 billion dollars.  Thanks to the creation of this social network, Mark Zuckerberg at the age of 31 is the youngest of the 50 richest people on the planet.  His fortune is estimated at 42.8 billion dollars. <br><br>  Together with his wife, Zuckerberg <a href="https://geektimes.ru/post/266794/">promised to donate 99% of Facebook's personal shares to charity</a> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/a26/046/b92/a26046b92cefdb1b4319ef47e7d4a608.jpg" width="600" alt="image"><br><br><h4>  7. Larry Ellison </h4><br>  American entrepreneur Larry Ellison founded the corporation Oracle, became the largest shareholder of NetSuite Inc.  and investor Salesforce.com. <br><br>  In the early 1970s, one of his projects as a developer was the creation of a database management system for the CIA, which he called Oracle - Oracle.  In 1977, conscientiously with colleagues at Ampex, Ellison founded Software Development Laboratories, which in 1982 renamed Oracle. <br><br>  As the CEO of the corporation, Allison worked for 38 years, but in 2014 he left her, remaining chairman of the board of directors, and took the post of director of technology of the corporation. <br><br>  The assets of Ellisor in the amount of $ 45.3 billion include real estate, including a resort in Hawaii. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/5d3/8aa/6a9/5d38aa6a98ee8161b863a6432887c77e.jpg" width="600" alt="image"><br><br><h4>  6.

The company generates $ 115 billion dollars in sales, it employs more than 100 thousand people.  Koch is involved in political life, for which he is under attack from the press: some people believe that politics helps him protect a company that produces a huge amount of very different products and, consequently, pollutes the environment. <br><br>  The condition of Charles Koch is estimated at 46.8 billion dollars. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/727/8cc/42b/7278cc42b8451f41b2c2eecf796b0966.png" width="600" alt="image"><br><br><h4>  5.

Koch donated $ 1.2 billion through his foundation to study and search for ways to fight cancer, hospitals, education and other purposes. <br><br>  The state of David Koch is estimated at 47.4 billion dollars. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/101/631/c65/101631c651464c67dd44a86f2435bf06.jpg" width="600" alt="image"><br><br><h4>  4.

As a child, Buffett carried newspapers on a bicycle, and at 11 he bought three first stocks for $ 38, selling them with a $ 5 profit.  At 13, Warren filed an income statement and deducted the cost of a bicycle and hours, because their purchase was related to the work of a newspaper peddler.  The first 10 thousand dollars Buffett earned after the installation of pinball machines in hairdressing salons.  Buffett was taught to invest by Benjamin Graham. <br><br>  Buffett‚Äôs main share capital is its stake in Bershire Hathaway, an American holding company.  In the years 2000-2010, the shares of this company grew by 76%. <br><br>  The condition of 85-year-old Warren Buffet is estimated at 60.7 billion dollars.  Together with Bill Gates and other very rich people, Buffett participates in the Giving Pledge event - that is, he will give more than half of it to charity. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/683/097/a85/683097a855773ee389d108520cf4e3ec.jpg" width="600" alt="image"><br><br><h4>  2. Amancio Ortega </h4><br>  Amancio Ortega, a 79-year-old entrepreneur from Spain, began working at the age of 13 as a courier at a local shirt shop.  Later he founded Inditex with his wife - this company owns 5,000 stores in 77 countries.  Ortega has invested in real estate, gas, tourism and banks. <br><br>  Inditex owns the brands Zara, Pull and Bear, Massimo Dutti, Bershka, Stradivarius, Oysho. <br><br>  Now in the hands of Amancio Ortega are concentrated 66.8 billion dollars. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/cde/c28/9e9/cdec289e909016dfb3c608b437d7dd82.jpg" width="600" alt="image"><br><br><h4>  1. Bill Gates </h4><br>  The assets of the 60-year-old Bill Gates are estimated at $ 87.4 billion US dollars.  In 20 years, Gates, together with his childhood friend Paul Allen, founded Microsoft, and ten years later brought the company to IPO and became a billionaire.  Until 2000, Bill Gates was the company's CEO, then became chairman of the board and the largest shareholder. <br><br>  Bill Gates is known not only as the richest man in the world, but also as one of the most generous.  In 1999, he and his wife, Melinda, organized a fund that manages $ 40 billion and helps people fight <a href="https://geektimes.ru/post/268434/">poverty</a> and <a href="https://geektimes.ru/post/269788/">disease</a> . <br><br>  Earlier, with the help of Warren Buffett, Gates persuaded billionaires to take part in the Giving Pledge campaign: participants promise to donate more than half of their wealth to charity.  Mark Zuckerberg and Ilon Musk, including 137 people, have already joined the action. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/eeb/076/79e/eeb07679e264549b59654e732a9d4f7d.jpg" width="600" alt="image"></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/298204/">https://habr.com/ru/post/298204/</a></p>
