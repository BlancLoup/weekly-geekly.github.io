  <section class="page js-page"><h1>RE: done by 95% or "Journey from Moscow to Petersburg"</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  You love driving a car.  You sat behind the wheel for the first time at the age of 14, received rights on your age of majority, having passed the test site with your eyes closed.  At some point, you realize that in order to make money it is not necessary to go to the office.  Becoming a middle manager, with dreams about a mortgage and rest in Antalya, is not at all part of your plans for life.  In order to earn money, you can just do what you love.  And you become a driver. <br><br>  You have a great reputation.  Colleagues respect you, passengers advise their friends.  You have seen different passengers.  Someone was rude, someone ran off without paying, someone, under the pretext that the ‚Äúcrisis‚Äù and ‚Äú200 rubles in his pocket‚Äù paid five times less than promised.  But this is your favorite thing.  And you continue to carry. <br><br>  Once at the train station, a frothing man runs up to you. <br>  - Take me! <br>  - Where?  - you are interested <br>  - Hurry up!  - the person shouts impatiently, waving money - Faster, I will pay for force majeure, only faster!

      You get into the car and turn around on the square near the station. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  - Why we could not drive on the lawn?  I ask - I need faster! <br>  - Can you tell where we are going?  - you ask again <br>  - Yes of course!  <s>I have a big project.</s> I need to get to St. Petersburg as soon as possible.  Then, if you meet the deadline, I will take you a full time salary driver. <br><br>  The last phrase is very inspiring to you, and you press the gas pedal.  You agree on road time and price.  Quite adequate for such a distance.  Comfortably grab the steering wheel and, avoiding the bumps and pits, carry your passenger.  As soon as you leave the Moscow Ring Road, your passenger asks you to come to Khimki.  Like with my mother did not say goodbye.  You reluctantly turn off.  After an hour and a half, you still leave Moscow.  The passenger constantly grumbles that so much time has been lost.  Then he begins to wonder what your experience is, how many times you have had an accident, were you in prison, what is your girl's name and what road are you taking?  The conversation tires you, but you try to be polite and answer all questions.  Then he asks to stop the car and begins to "test" you according to the rules of the road.  It seems to him that you are not competent enough to lead his ass.  On one question, you stumble (the situation begins to annoy you a little) and the passenger asks you to immediately return him to Moscow, because you are afraid to go with you.  By applying all of your diplomatic skills, you settle the problem, and the passenger reluctantly agrees to go on.  On the way, he asks to stop many times.  And during one stop you notice that he has stepped onto the highway and catches a passing car.  You are interested in what is the matter, to which he replies that the appointed price is inadequate for such a route, and he wants to insure himself.  After half an hour, he still gives up and sits back.  Then, unexpectedly, he asks to drive through Tver.  You did not plan this, but still agree.  When you hint that this is an additional destination, and it would not be bad to pay extra, the passenger is indignant and says that you are not a person of the word, and that you have already agreed on a specific amount from which it is impossible to retreat.  And again reminds you that if you are unhappy with something, then he will find another driver.  In Tver, you lose 3 hours waiting for your passenger.  Then he comes in and says that he no longer needs your ‚Äúincompetent services‚Äù and does not pay a penny.  As soon as you drive off from the city towards Moscow, how your unfortunate passenger calls you and says that he changed his mind and is ready to go further.  Promises to pay extra.  You reluctantly return and pick it up. <br><br>  For the rest of the way, he tells you how to drive, which radio station to listen to, where to turn and how to live.  After a few hours of such hell, naturally knocking out of the schedule for 5 hours you reach Peter.  Your passenger is so fed up with you that you want to get rid of him as soon as possible.  You take him to the outskirts of the city and say that you have fulfilled your part of the persuasion - take him along the route Moscow-Peter and take off your duties.  He is paying you, but since you don‚Äôt have time, he shrugs and rounds the amount down, and he‚Äôs unhappy that he wasn‚Äôt taken to his destination. <br><br>  <b>Dear friends, let's see both sides of <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/freelance/65925/">this</a> issue.</b> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/65942/">https://habr.com/ru/post/65942/</a></p>
