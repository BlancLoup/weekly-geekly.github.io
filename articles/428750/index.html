Almost detailed instruction</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  When the customer first outlined the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãhis project - Rosnatszdrav, it seemed very interesting.  Actually, it was so. <br><br>  Just imagine, the federal association, which will combine medical organizations from all over Russia, will allow ordinary patients from anywhere in the country to get an online consultation from a specialist, say, from Moscow, and, if necessary, to sign up for a real appointment. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  At the initial stage, it could be a little alarming that the concept described above was the essence of TK.  But the project is interesting and ambitious - so it was even interesting to take part in the formation of a more adequate TK. <br><br>  As a result, it was formed.  It was supposed to create the most understandable shell of the product in the form of a website, where the client, providing the minimum set of parameters, got into the personal account, which was the main project.

      In addition, in order to attract organizations to the association, the latter were invited to participate in a legislative initiative.  Simply put, if you collect several large organizations in one association, it is possible to lobby for laws that will help them carry out their activities. <br><br>  The customer, however, was very afraid to use the word ‚Äúlobby‚Äù, although there is nothing negative in it, and even asked to exclude it from the presentation of the project, but more on that later. <br><br>  A private office, more precisely, private offices, was a multi-level system of interactions between a doctor, a patient, an organization, and also between doctors of different organizations. <br><br>  When the TOR was approved - the creation of prototypes and the logical structure of the project began, the work was truly tremendous - hundreds of pages of prototypes that, in addition to displaying the visual structure, were also some kind of TK for future programming. <br><br>  The fact that the TK was preliminary, at the time we did not know.  Fortunately (well, as it turned out later, unfortunately) the customer preferred personal meetings to discuss the project.  Usually it is even better, it speeds up the process, and it is possible to coordinate individual parts in the ‚Äúplug &amp; play‚Äù mode. <br><br>  But, alas, each meeting did not become a frontier, after which the next stage of development was to begin, but with brainstorming, in the spirit: ‚ÄúLet's do it like this!‚Äù, ‚ÄúAnd here I was given an idea to me‚Äù.  As a result, ready-made prototypes had to be redone, and, given the rather direct interconnection of all cabinet elements - a small, seemingly edit, could lead to the fact that almost everything had to be changed.  Probably, it is not necessary to say that the customer considered edits of this kind as a normal working process, and did not consider it expedient to increase the estimate. <br><br>  Practically at each meeting, new circumstances emerged, such as the impossibility of certain types of consultations, for example, doctor-patient consultations under the laws of the Russian Federation, and the need for the patient to go to the doctor in his city, and conduct online consultation in his presence.  Moreover, the latter was supposed to be a member of the association for the direct possibility of using a personal account and the software itself for conducting a TrueConf session integrated into a personal account. <br><br>  Separately, it is worth mentioning the expertise, and its importance in the development of projects.  At first, a fairly well-known cardiologist was present at the meetings, he, as they say, advocated for the product, and not for its shell.  He offered some really interesting ideas, and what is more important - he considered the real launch of the project more important than his endless rework ‚Äúon the knee‚Äù.  Considering that he is a real doctor, it would seem that you should heed his advice.  But, judging by the fact that after the 3rd meeting he dropped out of the project - expert opinion was considered not the most important parameter in the development.  What is funny - instead of a cardiologist, a dentist came to one of the following meetings. <br><br>  As a result, two design iterations were prepared, the coordination of which, fortunately, passed without any problems. <br><blockquote><ul><li>  <a href="https://yadi.sk/d/1fCtEsY-doaNPA">The first version looked like this</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://yadi.sk/d/zYu11fgR3ZgRfP">But the second version looked like this</a> </li></ul></blockquote>  And then the real trash and intoxication began, the customer, apparently not understanding exactly how the programming process takes place, decided to contact the programmer himself, bypassing us, and not just to connect, but also to start giving him new introductors directly, and later decided to pay at all to him directly, but at the same time, continuing to work with us. <br><br>  As a result, the developed and rolled-out project turned out to be in stasis, because the program part was built on new, unexpected ideas that no one had told us.  The programmer apparently thought that the customer did it - and the customer felt that everything is automatically integrated and will work, which edits do not allow. <br><br>  Despite the fact that we continued to cooperate, prepared a full-fledged presentation of the project, layouts of business cards for the employees and associates of the customer (who, in the course of work, changed twice) - the huge project could not take off. <br><br>  At the initial stage, we suggested adding a project at IIDF (Internet Initiatives Development Fund), working out weak points, finding out additional expert opinions - but the customer rejected this idea.  He already knows what to do.  This is noteworthy because a few months later, in the general chat, we saw a message in the spirit: ‚ÄúWhy didn't we use FRII?‚Äù <br><br>  As a result, in some desperate step, the customer found a designer who made an absolutely strange and irrelevant design logic, and then hired a company (we didn‚Äôt figure out which one), which turned the huge federal project into a small website -vizitku on the tilde, in which they did not even bother to pick up high-quality images, and the "Personal account" button in the corner of the screen remained the button leading to nowhere. <br><br>  It is always sad when an interesting project does not reach implementation, but it is even sadder when an almost realized project dies, because the customer could not understand what he wants, and there were more and more great new ideas. <br><br>  As a result, a business card site instead of a federal multifunctional portal. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/428750/">https://habr.com/ru/post/428750/</a></p>
