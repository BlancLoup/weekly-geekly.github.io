  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Pricing when creating a site and problems on the route Client - Contractor</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Good day!  Writing an article (and the very registration in TM) was inspired by the article <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/post/322590/">‚ÄúPricing when creating a website‚Äù</a> - I really want to move some points over ‚Äúi‚Äù in order to arrange them more ‚Äúfen-shuyno‚Äù.  Well, naturally, from a subjective point of view.  And this very point of view will go "from the inside" of the process from the part of the performer, not the client.  But in general, this text is also for the information of the Client, and not an attempt to blindly defend "unjustly offended" studios or individual designers.  Nobody claims to "break cover" and other sensation. <br><br><h3>  The customer is always right, who pays - he orders the music </h3><br>  Let us suppose.  But you should always remember about competence and respect.  Competence - because the Client, as a rule, has neither a tooth nor a trend in design, nor in the nuances of using any cms or frameworks.  That is, the Client does not know how it works and how it should be.  Respect must be present to the production process itself.  Yes, you pay.  But having paid for a plane ticket, you are not getting into the cockpit to the pilots with your Valuable Guidance?  And if you climb - well, then a successful flight. <br><br>  This is what happens in the development process.  Often there is no TK, or even an understanding of why it is needed at all.  That is, at this stage, it is very convenient for the Client to say ‚Äúwell, you are experts, you know how to‚Äù.  And if the studio / designer has little experience, they will eat this statement - which later, in 90% of cases, will lead to many sorrows for both parties. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Hence the moral - do not play a game like "who convinces whom."  Everything that you are convinced of should be recorded and structured in the TK.

      Imagine that you come to the store for bread.  You say: "to me such and such, yes fresher."  You do not start a half-hour monologue "well, I don‚Äôt know what I want, you are a salesman, you tell me, I‚Äôm paying money in the end."  Because in response, they will fairly say to you a couple of affectionate ones or they will find them insane and they will call either the police or the orderlies.  And in this case, you understand that such an act of the seller is deserved. <br><br>  But if the bread even turns out to be tasteless, moldy or stale, you simply throw it away - ‚Äúit costs a penny, I will buy another one‚Äù.  The site (I am silent about the web application or platform) costs money, your money.  And simply throwing out the ‚Äúleft‚Äù product is too luxurious. <br><br>  So - if you do not want to harm yourself, you should not put the statement ‚ÄúThe customer is always right‚Äù at the forefront.  Where you do not know something - pay for it to other people, let them fill in the blanks.  Yes, making TK is a completely separate and original service.  I will make a reservation that TK is for describing the functional.  For design, there is initially a brief, then - building a vision together with a designer or studio manager.  <b>Even</b> so.  Because devil-may-care attitude to this issue will lead to the situation ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know HOW I want, but it‚Äôs definitely not SO‚Äù.  Design redrawing, you are nervous, designers too, time is ticking.  So we come to the consideration of the following assertion. <br><br><h3>  Designer - not a psychoanalyst, not a telepath, not a patron </h3><br>  It doesn't matter whether it is good or bad.  This is just a fact. <br><br>  Not a psychoanalyst - in the sense that no one is obliged to dive into your inner world and analyze it in order to understand what you like.  This must be explained by you.  There is no vision - again, then it‚Äôs better to trust the experts, and don‚Äôt try to show ‚ÄúI am also a wow guy, I‚Äôll show you how to‚Äù.  Not to know is not a shame.  This is normal, because you came to the studio or to the designer (in rare cases they come because they can do it themselves, but there is no time). <br><br>  Not a telepath - because that's it.  Well, not yet reached the human race to this.  Maybe the genes are not you - who knows? <br><br>  Therefore - try to convey your ideas as thoroughly as possible.  You can not / do not know - it means that you have to ... yes, trust the experts. <br><br>  Otherwise, we come to the point ‚Äúthe designer is not a patron of the arts‚Äù.  This means that if you initially do not know what you want, then you will usually draw 3 options.  Further, the only question is to choose everything you liked and reduce to a single option.  When it is approved - it is done.  And no one is obliged to reshape it for free when new ideas come to you.  Especially at the stage of layout or implementation.  Everything that seems "easy" only seems.  Do not believe - try it yourself. <br><br><h4>  Somehow a bit too much to "trust the experts" </h4><br>  What's the big deal?  You originally chose them.  Opened 10+ sites, looked at the portfolio.  Not?  - then who is your doctor? <br><br>  Just at the stage of discussing the project with the studio, try to insist on the presence of their designer.  Or ask the manager to show those completed projects that the studio is proud of and those that are not included in the portfolio.  Because often everyone has "skeletons in the closet."  Usually they appear when a studio or designer is greedy (‚ÄúI‚Äôll finish the project, I want my 50% postpay‚Äù) and weakness (submitting to the customers, without looking at its horrible taste).  Look at such projects to be imbued.  Usually a good site is spoiled by the client.  Well, in the case of the ‚Äúclient is always right‚Äù tactics, the studio allows the client to spoil everything.  Why are arguing with a person if he is right and pays? <br><br>  Adequacy and understanding - the key to success.  If you need a normal portrait - go to the portrait painter.  If you yourself chose an abstractionist - face the consequences. <br><br>  Talk about this, it turns out, can be a lot and for a long time.  To recap: <br>  Have an understanding of what you want.  Not having - carefully choose who you trust.  Trusting - respect the time and nerves (and their own, and others).  And yet the most important (in those cases when it is not a personal blog) - remember, <b>you make a site not for yourself, but for future visitors to your site.</b> <br><br>  There is a great and powerful truth hidden in this statement.  Whoever comprehends - he will never have at his disposal the TOS. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/322886/">https://habr.com/ru/post/322886/</a></p>
