Legal Tech is not yet included in the investment portfolios of funds, but a lot has already been done to make this happen.  In particular, the 2 best projects will receive seats in accelerators, as well as cash prizes from sponsors. </blockquote>  <b>Anna Pozdnyakova</b> General Counsel of the Flint Capital Investment Fund

    <blockquote>  Already, recent university students often ask us for help in finding employment.  The market reduces the workload of a junior lawyer, replacing it with high-quality technological solutions, so it's time to stop being business representatives and become business yourself, creating jobs and engaging in a favorite and interesting business. </blockquote>  <b>Anar Kostenko</b> CEO of Legal Hub <br><br>  Hackathon will be held in 2 stages. <br><br>  The first - until November 1 - the collection of applications for participation.  Following its results, on November 5, at 15.00, a meeting with teams will be held at the hackathon site to discuss product ideas. <br><br>  The second one - on November 18-19, the main event will take place in the coworking center ‚ÄúAtmosphere‚Äù, which will last 2 days.  The best experts of investment funds, accelerators, legal departments of corporations will actively work with teams on the hackathon and share their experience. <br><br>  Over the weekend, participants are invited to assemble or supplement the team for their project, make a prototype under the guidance of mentors, present the product to an expert jury and win a cash prize, as well as special prizes from sponsors and partners of the event. <br><br>  Invited to participate: <br><br><ul><li>  programmers, specialists in machine learning, mathematics, undergraduates of law schools; </li><li>  lawyers; </li><li>  Legal Tech startups; </li><li>  entrepreneurs with experience in the development of technology businesses; </li><li>  marketers who are interested in developing legal tech startups. </li></ul><br>  Participation is free. <br><br>  ‚Üí <a href="http://legalhackers.moscow/hackathon2017"><b>Registration by reference</b></a> <br><br><blockquote>  Soon, substantial money will come to Legal Tech.  In 2014, startups Legal Tech in the USA invested $ 254 million. We believe that the quality of the hackathon projects will be so high that most of them will continue their life and development after it, as was the case with solutions presented in Kiev. </blockquote>  <b>Holger Zsheige</b> CEO Infotropic Media <br><br>  Technologies that penetrate into all spheres of life, even such conservatives as jurisprudence: artificial intelligence, machine learning, solutions built on language processing, radically change their profession, become indispensable assistants in solving business problems. <br><br>  All interested are invited to demonstrate their ideas and achievements, as well as enlist the support in promoting their product. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/341246/">https://habr.com/ru/post/341246/</a></p>
