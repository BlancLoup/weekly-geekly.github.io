  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Cartoon "Gypsy": New Characters</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img src="http://tsigan.ru/images/ul/0fef98cb-c6f7-4d1e-9545-d74b1aeb2633.jpg" alt="Main"><br>  Good day.  We are currently working very fruitfully on the script for the full-length film. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Since the people are already working very rich in ideas, we have long since lost count - how many ideas have already been invented, rejected and even forgotten. <br><img src="http://tsigan.ru/images/ul/3e20da7b-ef07-4a16-ae26-0e9b3e0fc55e.jpg" alt="Many"><br>  On the other hand, our artists are accustomed to thinking in pictures.  That is, while an ordinary person thinks about the character of the character and his actions, the artist sits down and this character paints.  Or sculpts.  And then it turns out that the script has changed again, and this character has no place in the film anymore. <br><img src="http://tsigan.ru/images/ul/28254334-c517-4b27-a391-f33fcca1911b.jpg" alt="Many2"><br>  Thus, today we have gathered quite a lot of some funny characters, which are not the fact that they will enter into a cartoon in general and the fact that they will not enter in the form in which they thought.  Formed such a clip of spare characters, which, if they appear in the cartoon - will appear with some new stories and characters.  I mean, in fact, with new passports. <br>  Some of them still seem funny to us, and we decided to introduce them to you. <br><br>  So, get acquainted: <br>  <em>Gerasim.</em> <br><br>  Young, terribly healthy guy.  Unintelligibly intelligent, but possessing such a distinctive, very naive peasant cunning.

    <br><img src="http://tsigan.ru/images/ul/4d39418f-7864-4493-b5f4-b07045ea4753.jpg" alt="Gerasim3"><br>  He is talkative, barely smiles, frowning at first glance. <br>  And our Gojo at the first stages of dating was very much afraid of him.  Moreover, Gerasim himself (it must be understood that this is a very conditional name of this character, but we should somehow call this ambala) didn‚Äôt sympathize with Gojo from the very beginning. <br><br><img src="http://tsigan.ru/images/ul/8cff7b30-878f-408f-bdd8-9534c68312ac.jpg" alt="Gerasim2"><br>  Then at some stage in the development of the plot, we planned to show that behind the formidable appearance and intractability there is a rather clever and cunning type hiding who could quite gracefully and ingeniously cheat Gojo himself. <br> <em><br></em> <img src="http://tsigan.ru/images/ul/b209006a-cd16-46cf-9a31-b95d0b0524ab.jpg" alt="Ger"><br><br>  <em>Healer.</em> <br><br>  The healer appeared just like a character.  The artist ran into the door and shouted happily: <br>  - I drew you a doctor!  Very beautiful doctor turned out.  May be one of the central characters. <br>  The answer was the sound of a shot.  It was the scriptwriter who tried to kill himself, who by that time was finishing the 48th version of the script that did not contain any healers and even veterinarians. <br><br><img src="http://tsigan.ru/images/ul/000c72cd-b059-401d-ab48-d55074486195.jpg" alt="Doctor 3"><br>  However, everyone liked the Doctor, and therefore the character began to acquire some kind of biography.  Or rather, even a few biographies. <br>  According to one of the versions, he was over a hundred years old, of which over 80 he was engaged in the study of magic and medicine.  80 years of medical education anyone can spoil the character, because the doctor was offered almost the main anti-hero. <br><br><img src="http://tsigan.ru/images/ul/67da9ca8-6909-4891-ba9c-aab522eaf957.jpg" alt="Doctor 1"><br><br>  According to another version, it was as ancient as the universe a sorcerer, who suddenly became bored, where he lived, and he was drawn to the people.  Thanks to his witchcraft, he could always watch the adventures of Gojo and his friends.  And at some point, it all became for him a kind of fascinating series - perhaps the only entertainment for him. <br><br><img src="http://tsigan.ru/images/ul/4636a8dc-c508-4230-94d4-65ff670d9583.jpg" alt="Lekar2"><br><br>  There were more versions: This is enchanted Katya Lel, honored Santa Claus in exile, Gosha Kutsenko as Nikolai Slichenko.  But all these versions for some reason have disappeared by themselves.  And he just remained a healer.  Wise, unpredictable, mysterious. <br></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/112933/">https://habr.com/ru/post/112933/</a></p>
