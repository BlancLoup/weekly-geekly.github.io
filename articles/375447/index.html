In fact, CES is an exhibition (or even a show) primarily for consumers, so the stunning new products are almost not shown here, but devices that are ready for commercial production (for example, TVs), processor technologies that set the development vector of smartphones and computers demonstrate year, as well as concepts that show the level of technology in general.  That is why the exhibition is not the first year more famous for robots and smart cars, rather than flagship smartphones, which we will see at the MWC in March. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h1>  Toshiba </h1><br>  The Japanese were marked by one of the most interesting devices at the exhibition - the robot Aiko Chihira, frighteningly <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25C7%25EB%25EE%25E2%25E5%25F9%25E0%25FF_%25E4%25EE%25EB%25E8%25ED%25E0">similar to a real person</a> .  The robot is able to sing and gesticulate, emotions are displayed on its face.  True, in these aspects, imitation of a person is not so impressive, there is still something to work on.  However, this is a very impressive development. <br><br>  Toshiba predicts a wide distribution of such <b>humanoid</b> robots by the years 2025-2030.  They are tipped a lot of different ways of use, including information services at stations and airports, concierges, carers, etc.

They do not have a prism, and the projector image is mounted on the right hand.  This does not end the oddity: glasses do not have their own power source, they work from devices connected to them.  Camera and memory card missing.  Despite the ascetic feature set, Toshiba offers many different scenarios for the use of glasses.  There are three types of frames: universal, sports and for work in industrial environments. <br><br>  <a href="https://hi-tech.mail.ru/article/Toshiba_ces_2015.html">Photos and videos from the stand of Toshiba</a> . <br><br><h1>  Intel </h1><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/80c/fc8/efe/80cfc8efe8d043aa88b408cb0e5fa95c.jpg"><br><br>  The company feels great - at the exhibition there were practically no laptops that do not work on an Intel processor.  Moreover, the broadest way were presented models on the newest generation of processors, Broadwell.  Intel has traditionally introduced a number of processors, including in the framework of the platform Core U, designed to create powerful systems. <br><br>  Intel has not forgotten about the technology RealSense 3D, and the wireless charging Rezence.  However, for the success of Rezence in the market, you need to enlist the broad support of gadget manufacturers.  The same can be said about the numerous products for the Internet of things. <br><br>  <a href="https://hi-tech.mail.ru/article/intel_ces2015.html">The most important announcements from Intel</a> . <br><br><h1>  Qualcomm </h1><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/051/93a/d2f/05193ad2fa14447f9e9db9b0d1349b31.jpg"><br><br>  Intel's competitors are not asleep: Qualcomm showed at the exhibition a new standard Wi-Fi 802.11ad, a whole range of solutions based on the Snapdragon 602a processor for automakers, all sorts of components for a smart home, the Internet of things and many other areas.  Not all kinds of existing technologies were forgotten, for example, QuickCharge fast charging. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/cc6/b51/664/cc6b51664da2433d8ab69ea2e9fcc056.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b87/019/584/b870195843b944cba4a4ac0559c4d248.jpg"><br><br>  As mentioned above, Qualcomm has paid great attention to the <a href="https://hi-tech.mail.ru/news/ces2015-cars.html">automotive industry</a> .  In particular, the company has launched new Maserati Quattroporte GTS and Cadillac XTS 2015, equipped with Snapdragon 602A, 3G / 4G LTE modems, Bluetooth and Wi-Fi from Qualcomm, as well as Android 5.0 (in Cadillac) and QNX (in Maserati) . <br><br>  <a href="https://hi-tech.mail.ru/article/Qualcomm_CES2015.html">The main announcements of Qualcomm</a> . <br><br><h1>  Nvidia </h1><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/481/fbc/ad7/481fbcad7b3a450e87254436525e7bf5.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b7e/15d/9fe/b7e15d9fe2b34bf6bfed2eab06661538.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/9ec/1eb/2f1/9ec1eb2f118d4117b272dc0cd5c27767.jpg"><br><br>  Nvidia booth traditionally attracts a lot of attention.  The Americans announced the most powerful mobile platform to date - the new mobile processor Tegra X1 with a 256-core graphics accelerator.  According to a number of parameters, this mobile solution is now comparable to the ‚Äúadult‚Äù Nvidia GeForce GTX 980: here there is support for OpenGL ES 3.1, OpenGL 4.5, and the ability to decode 4K video at 60p.  The novelty will be of particular interest for the TV and automotive industries. <br><br>  As you have probably guessed, the automotive theme has become one of the main trends of the exhibition.  Nvidia also offered its solution for the "iron horses" - a platform for the onboard computer Drive CX and a platform for the autopilot Drive PX. <br><br>  <a href="https://hi-tech.mail.ru/article/NVIDIA_CES2015.html">The main announcements of Nvidia</a> . <br><br><h1>  Acer </h1><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/22a/f61/478/22af614785e14bf9ae03e815a75b755f.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a43/00c/51d/a4300c51dfe6420b9d88a1269df59145.jpg"><br><br>  Taiwanese showed at the exhibition a whole range of gadgets.  For example, Chromebook 15 turned into a laptop with the largest diagonal among all such devices running ChromeOS.  The high-performance multimedia notebook Acer Aspire V17 Nitro has got support of the Intel RealSense 3D technology.  Now you can control the device without a touchpad, simply drawing various gestures in the air.  And for their registration are responsible IR sensor and built-in camera.  This technology even allows you to create a simple three-dimensional model of an object, which can then be sent to a 3D printer. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/4b4/887/419/4b4887419b324acb91d95713f6db0dc5.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/3cf/de1/fd1/3cfde1fd1b7a4a8ea7de12620f5f377d.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a57/9e1/471/a579e1471f8e4059853753fe14f2c2fa.jpg"><br><br>  Also of the new products can be noted compact multimedia center Acer Revo One, as well as smartphones Liquid Jade S and Liquid Z410. <br><br>  <a href="https://hi-tech.mail.ru/article/acer_ces_2015.html">Acer main announcements</a> . <br><br>

It will go on sale in the second quarter, and its value should be $ 399. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/8e3/3c1/241/8e33c124107c4aa8892578bbda173938.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/fe3/291/7e8/fe32917e83fe41d4b5e202a744079fb0.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/32c/01d/b2a/32c01db2a9c0494aa73f198acdf92c7c.jpg"><br><br>  ASUS also showed at once three updated Transformer Book Chi notebook models.  All are equipped with fifth-generation Intel processors. <br><br>  <a href="https://hi-tech.mail.ru/article/asus_ces2015.html">ASUS main announcements</a> . <br><br><h1>  Lenovo </h1><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/4a5/a93/8e1/4a5a938e1b344663b00c7255e4fb6f13.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f02/ca0/8e3/f02ca08e34af41ccb02f7ddb165b8b56.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/49f/657/99a/49f65799afe64715a1d708eff2bd9269.jpg"><br><br>  At the stand of the Chinese, it was possible to turn in the hands of many new products, including smartphones P90, VIBE X2 Pro and S60.  All of them have their own interesting features and will certainly interest buyers. <br><br>  Lenovo has not remained aloof from the fashion trends and presented a smart bracelet VIBE Band VB10, equipped with a display on electronic ink.  The bracelet performs both the function of reporting events on a smartphone and a fitness tracker.  Due to its high energy efficiency, the gadget can work up to 7 days with the display and Bluetooth on all the time. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/5df/9a4/18d/5df9a418da334e1093326efd05b8d46b.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/808/958/797/80895879767f4c84866417ef5646f265.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/207/a80/ebd/207a80ebd6f440f9b42e249cd52eb3f8.jpg"><br><br>  Laptops under the NEC brand, in particular, the NEC LaVie 13 model, have a special attention. With a 13-inch diagonal display, it weighs only 779 grams, today it is the lightest laptop in the world. <br><br>  Lenovo <a href="https://hi-tech.mail.ru/article/Lenovo_CES2015.html">mobile</a> devices and <a href="https://hi-tech.mail.ru/article/Lenovo_computers_CES2015.html">laptops</a> . <br><br><h1>  Dell </h1><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/389/6c7/066/3896c7066a72475dbddf802a3e3af428.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/76d/51a/a9a/76d51aa9a8bf42b0aeab938f77113a6f.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c83/d84/bd0/c83d84bd0b0b4db9ac3c0ca43cd2550e.jpg"><br><br>  Three years ago, at CES 2012, Dell introduced the XPS 13 laptop. It was notable for the fact that the manufacturer managed to fit it into the body of a 12-inch laptop.  This year a new version of this device was introduced, which is comparable in size to 11-inch laptops.  The width of the frame around the screen is only 5.2 mm, the processor Core i5 fifth generation.  The weight turned out to be a match for the sizes, 1.18 and 1.26 kg for the versions with a regular and touch display, respectively.  Despite its compactness, the laptop, according to Dell, is capable of working up to 15 hours in playback mode Full HD-video. <br><br>  <a href="https://hi-tech.mail.ru/news/dell-xps-13.html">Dell XPS 13 2015</a> . <br><br><h1>  LG </h1><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b4a/6f9/142/b4a6f91424eb4b9f9995e566d426025f.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/3b5/c50/166/3b5c501665e7449ca001d997e332bd82.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b41/d16/1bb/b41d161bb362458da10ca94afd717ffc.jpg"><br><br>  This year, the Koreans' showers were TVs.  First of all, of course, these are LCD models with 4K / Ultra HD resolution, supporting technologies of extended color gamut.  Also, the manufacturer has significantly expanded the range of OLED-TVs. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/1a1/3dc/2b4/1a13dc2b449645349a89263e0de6e0af.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c71/dfc/1aa/c71dfc1aa1d34971bb48e287cab32dd4.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/65b/064/190/65b06419048144a7bb53758aa26f0e7a.jpg"><br><br>  However, most of all visitors were interested in the LG G Flex 2 curved smartphone. In addition to its unusual shape, it boasts a self-healing case material.  Compared with the first version of the smartphone, the strength increased by 20%, and the recovery rate at room temperature increased from 3 minutes to 10 seconds.  But that's not all - LG G Flex 2 became the first commercial device based on the Qualcomm Snapdragon 810 processor. <br><br>  <a href="https://hi-tech.mail.ru/article/LG_Mobile_CES2015.html">LG G Flex 2</a> and LG <a href="https://hi-tech.mail.ru/article/LG_Ultra_HD_CES2015.html">TVs</a> . <br><br><h1>  Sony </h1><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/7aa/9fe/5bb/7aa9fe5bbd4e4b49a54c8d675eaf7d6f.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/09e/6ec/d5d/09e6ecd5d67d4d28a7942cf36e8fbbae.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/dcb/c68/52c/dcbc6852cced4538819dd31458e3fed8.jpg"><br><br>  This year, Sony introduced an extensive range of new products.  Both the hardware and software of the TVs have been significantly improved.  Looks fascinated models of the ultra-slim X90C series with the design of Floating Style.  With a diagonal of 55 and 65 inches, TVs at the thinnest point are only 4.9 mm thick. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/cf6/83f/243/cf683f2434614580aede94922400ad07.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/387/4d7/d0e/3874d7d0e7184e2199cdec7509075e00.jpg"><br><br>  With the onset of 4K TVs, video cameras were pulled up, allowing to shoot content with the appropriate resolution.  Now a full 4K camera can be purchased for $ 1,000, which can be called a psychologically important mark. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/133/4fb/b37/1334fbb37a1747dbb1834f6f14fdf053.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a56/a52/016/a56a520162d04bc3837f345733b4d085.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c08/6ac/a94/c086aca947f1455da1e2efe9eb50f1c8.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/2a9/d2d/994/2a9d2d994f4f408bb99e07be983cc5a2.jpg"><br><br>  Sony has not forgotten about the "second plan" devices, having updated its audiophile player <a href="https://hi-tech.mail.ru/catalog/sony/sony_nwz_zx1_128_gb_14196724/">NWZ-ZX1</a> .  True, it is more restyling than a full-fledged new model.  The price corresponds to the high class of the device - 1120 dollars. <br><br>  Sony <a href="https://hi-tech.mail.ru/article/Sony_4K_CES2015.html">televisions</a> and <a href="https://hi-tech.mail.ru/article/sony_ces2015_cameras.html">cameras</a> . <br><br><h1>  Panasonic </h1><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/688/0dd/98f/6880dd98f4a447759ccd7d4438318982.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f2d/1e2/dc8/f2d1e2dc8df54121b4ba33ee0db72ad0.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/7cc/faa/b99/7ccfaab99c344de2827abd7d45d1e51e.jpg"><br><br>  First of all, the Japanese have improved the characteristics of their TVs, and special emphasis was placed on the flagship line CX850.  Panasonic even stated that the representatives of this line can boast the most correct color rendition in the consumer market.  A very bold statement.  The rest of the exhibits on the stand did not stand out with something special, with the exception, perhaps, of the Ultra HD Blu-Ray player. <br><br>  <a href="https://hi-tech.mail.ru/article/Panasonic_Ultra_HD_CES2015.html">New Panasonic</a> . <br><br><h1>  Alcatel </h1><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/bb6/922/35b/bb692235b9f0400f96d7ee839255ed6a.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/297/e26/e36/297e26e363c2475fa5bd34aecad4c0dd.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/384/1bb/cf5/3841bbcf58bd42da90455e839698f080.jpg"><br><br>  The central place in the exposition was taken by the OneTouch Watch smart watch.  This is the very rare case when non-Android Wear is used in a device of this class.  The obvious consequence was the ability to connect devices on Android and iOS.  Also, the watch has a built-in fitness tracker with rather wide functionality.  The price is very attractive, only $ 150, but it must be remembered that the watch will not be able to install its software, you will have to use only the tools that are sewn into them. <br><br>  <a href="https://hi-tech.mail.ru/article/Alcatel_OneTouch_Watch.html">Watch Review</a> . <br><br><h1>  Kodak </h1><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/1be/960/9dc/1be9609dceb6456a97eea8b68e98a868.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/043/a3d/6ad/043a3d6adb954a8286d85f46df826ae7.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b94/0b5/4cf/b940b54cf1c64951989cde2a9c0dc752.jpg"><br><br>  The Americans have released under their brand several cameras, a photo set for smartphones and their own smartphone.

For example, it is equipped with two slots for memory cards up to 128 GB each, as well as 64 GB internal memory.  That is, in total, it can store up to 320 GB of data.
