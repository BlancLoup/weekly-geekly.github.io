    <h3>  Well, as they say, let's go! </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/cd/sp/e9/cdspe96njfok46m1gdema4nhnei.png"><br><br>  My children, not burdened with enhanced paternal upbringing, forget to flush after themselves in the toilet.  This mainly happens at night because  they get to the toilet half asleep.  This condition is enough for - to open one's eyes a bit, not to trip over cats and stumble to the toilet.  Scold do not scold, to no avail.  I understand that you can slap a slap, but I love them and this is not our method.  Morning amber, a volatile waste product, was present in the toilet almost every day.  With the thought - let the world cave in under us, began to look for a solution. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Having surfed the Internet, I found two noteworthy options. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/sp/l6/0t/spl60thzfapm8l2j0tdv1ntj0gk.png"><br><br>  <b>Option one - The</b> tank from the toilet to the trash, disassemble the wall behind the toilet, set the automatic flush.  The option is excellent, but, a fresh repair, the arising necessity of ditching cavities for pipes, a hole in the wall for a piece of iron with eyes, a little trash, a little, a little dust and dirt, is done.  Inspired by the decision, he took the drill into his hands but looked into his wife‚Äôs clear eyes, tired of the recent repairs from his parents and even after telling how cool it would be, I realized that a divorce was not far off.  The option was dropped automatically, and the price tag in 17K + repeated partial repair, did not add inspiration. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/hh/o7/sm/hho7smesscaxj_gcjp2plyvb9fg.png"><br><br>  <b>The second option is the</b> bourgeois stray, which is placed inside the tank, runs on batteries and it seems to automate the flushing process, BUT, there are instructions on 5 sheets, a video for almost an hour and a hell of a lot of gestures for integration.  Almost bought, hands grow naturally from the right place (lower back), I can read, I must take.  The price tag is almost three times lower.  Googling and looking at the process, it came to me that the mechanism was sharpened for bourgeois tanks, in which there was not a top button, but a side foot.  I did not risk it.  Google also summed up - everything else is derived from the first option in different boxes and different sizes.  There are still interesting devices, but the price tag is far from humane and functional about nothing. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b38/495/4a3/b384954a39722db0a32224487be82f4c.png" alt="image"><br><br><h3>  Motives and goals </h3><br>  As a result of lengthy research, I was left without an easy solution and one on one with an invigorating morning smell after visiting the toilet of my beloved boys and two cats ... but they do not count because  for them a separate shoe, in cat purgatory. <br><br>  I believe that prolonged toilet fumes positively influenced my thought process, the Russian brain is dodgy.  Suddenly, in a dream, an idea came up in my mind, to fasten a certain device to the flush button and make it respond correctly to the presence of a dangling body in front of the toilet, thereby automating the process budget-free and universally without any modifications, alterations, collective farms and perversions.  Moreover, to make it universal, with the ability to put the WASHER on the heads of other white brothers, as  Elderly parents living in other housing, especially grandfather, have a similar sin. <br><br>  The search for a similar, aesthetically finished and correctly (in my understanding) functioning device did not give any results.  It was decided to sculpt by myself, based on beautiful pictures in my head - how it can look and function. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/rv/bh/_b/rvbh_b9pqk3tjdn7xoynyg_toli.png"><br><br><h3>  Movement towards implementation </h3><br>  I‚Äôll bore you with beautiful stories about how much time (from scratch) was spent studying 3D modeling, interacting with 3D printing and studying electronic circuits. I won‚Äôt say one thing: a plastic wagon was spent to bring the project to its current state, hundreds of models were printed, etched football field boards.  There was creative soldering of microcircuits, firmware of microcontrollers (thanks to Vad7 for selfish help, this person helped me a lot), understanding of the work of electronic components, other glands and mechanics, and all the ‚Äútiring‚Äù conduct of combat testing on the personnel of the family for several months.  And so on. <br><br><h3>  Plastic </h3><br>  The beginning of the journey is research. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/yy/9i/r8/yy9ir8j644inynk6k99vbswahde.png"><br><br>  At the stage of entering production. <br><br>  The results of a heightened sense of perfectionism: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/y5/i8/zg/y5i8zgh62g7rg_mtaia9_dtk1ba.png"><br><br>  Now everything is factory: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/xc/af/j8/xcafj8uq5uabpo1tmch6sl72lf4.jpeg"><br><br><h3>  Electronics </h3><br>  In the beginning, it was really difficult.  Without education, my maximum was to solder a torn wire.  I did not understand why all these details are needed - capacitors, resistors, diodes, etc.  Well, theoretically, only if ... <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/bf/o0/sc/bfo0scgwvsh7y1tykwo_mntadzs.png"><br><br>  Now - I know how the transistor works :) <br><br>  All this is real, my hand-made.  We print, poison, solder, we get needlework :).  After he filled his hand and delved into the process, he moved to another level, began to order from friends with the Middle Kingdom.  Smart people showed a resource.  Now I draw everything myself.  But to be honest, a lot is still a mystery to me.  Yes, it‚Äôs easier now, but Zen hasn‚Äôt reached ... <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/5v/q1/va/5vq1va6tig9kjspyh2vcgl9tndq.png"><br><br>  Between relations with mock-ups, printing of details and soldering of circuits, he received patents for this ‚Äúiron‚Äù.  Yes, I got confused, but there were free funds for it ... The device was registered not only in the Russian Federation, but also in Belarus and Kazakhstan.  The European bourgeoisie downloaded and registered a patent for the PCT system, at that time it was no more expensive than money, in general a dumb show, but it‚Äôs nice when they know that we are not only in rocket science, but also in toilet use, tearing everyone. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ef/-a/o-/ef-ao-r6ezeir_mrp0ipokp2eqq.png"><br><br>  Initially, I thought, it seems to me, the not very successful name <b>autoPusher is</b> like a car pusher ... then smart people said that the pusher is a drug dealer.  This is what it means to skip English classes and live away from this topic.  Initially, I wanted ‚ÄúForget-me-not‚Äù, but all domains were occupied, but what has been done is done. <br><br>  Refused ... <br><br>  Now it‚Äôs a <b>WASHER</b> , I drew a logo, patented a trademark and, to my greatest amazement, got protection for the word ‚ÄúWASHER‚Äù in the framework of 11 and 21 MKTU I can brand with all responsibility. <br><br>  Registered domain of the same name in the RF zone.  In order not to explain to designers what and how I see, I partially dealt with the layout and the Internet store.  If there is a desire, come in, criticize.  Registered the same groups / channels in all popular networks.  At first there was a dark forest, then slowly, by its age (far from sixteen), it began to understand what was happening.  YouTube, insta, VKontakte there are all sorts of things. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/8e/lc/bs/8elcbspklox_qdhjivwcmd0sfum.png"><br><br>  At the end of 2015, he tried to conduct a crowdfunding company, he wanted to <s>earn money easily</s> on Indiegogo.  But apparently because behind the hill, tanks with a foot and a theme, let's say so intimate, got more widespread, and the experience was with a gulkin nose.  The public did not cause interest and success, as well as the planned funds, did not receive development.  A copy was posted on the Russian site, but that doesn‚Äôt count.  He hoped to quickly fill orders, work and become a modest oligarch, but he did not grow together.  Never fell from heaven.  Only labor is stubborn and merciless. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ft/2l/oz/ft2loz0cfbungqkan5uenblwczk.png"><br><br>  It was a disappointment, but, with grief, he didn‚Äôt fall into alcohol.  I had a little pressure, drank good wine (not for long) and postponed the project until a new ‚ÄúPUSH‚Äù of inspiration.  Pun:) ... <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/jy/29/8p/jy298pgn7zicfv-wlqgiasqjpl0.png"><br><br>  The moment of the second breath has come.  I decided to cheer up and continue ... <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/w7/hu/lx/w7hulxjnucr-eirvvsnw2bq94za.png"><br><br>  I brought all the plastic parts to a state - excellent, it works, it works for a long time, it is reliable.  Wow. <br><br>  I made it so that the washer could work by choice, in one of two different modes - in the light and in the presence.  I reworked the mechanism previously borrowed, as a base, from not infamous automatic stinks (enlightened ones would say they could just use a servo ... tried, eats) Autonomy and the possibility of long-term operation were put at the forefront.  He made the device more compact, added buns and prepared for the most difficult stages: production and pushing to the market.  A little frozen.  Without experience in production and in subtle technical matters that would allow a product to be transferred from a state - a solid prototype to a state - it‚Äôs completely possible to clone, it‚Äôs difficult.  Making working prototypes is only a small part of the business.  I must admit that before Steve Jobs, I‚Äôm as before ... nothing, from the word "absolutely."  I found sane companies in China that formed proposals for the production of plastic parts, machinery and all electronic components.  I would be glad to order everything from us, but the price tag is sky-high.  We found literate guys who took up the production of blister packaging and printing.  Now everything is going here on the spot.  All ordered components came to my warehouse.  We started to bring to mind the assembly process.  Yes, my eyes are afraid, it was all new to me, but the desire to bring everything to a victorious end, overpowered all fears. <br><br><h3>  Now in detail </h3><br>  Why is it necessary and what is it about: Automate the process of flushing the contents, in a conventional toilet with a tank on which the flush button is on top. <br><br>  <b>Where and where it can be put:</b> On any tanks where there is a button.  As a rule, in 90% of the tanks displayed on the window of any store, there are single-button buttons with a diameter of no more than 51 mm.  The fashion for two-button buttons has apparently passed. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ou/jj/37/oujj37zvh8ney3ag-ntwuos72ry.png"><br><br><h3>  Installation </h3><br>  We unscrew the button a couple of revolutions, we stick the washer into the gap.  Any blonde can cope with this simple procedure.  It does not fall out.  Believe me, a word. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/0af/843/677/0af843677cd58621d5858407f7f28cf9.gif" alt="image"><br><br><h3>  How it works? </h3><br>  Elementary. <br><br>  WASHER [LIGHT] mode - Turned on the light, WASHER woke up, began to count the time, as soon as the light in the toilet was on for more than 10 seconds, the WASHER switched to standby mode for the end of the process.  As soon as the process is completed, the person went out and turned off the light, the WASHER using the pusher will press the button and fall asleep again. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/a2/li/ny/a2linyej_lov-btarqpgpxfg210.png"><br><br>  WASHER [PRESENCE] mode As soon as the body appeared in a narrow field of view of the motion sensor for more than 10 seconds (usually this time is needed to prepare for the process and begin to defecate / urinate), the WASHER is in standby mode.  As soon as the process is completed and the body does not loom in the sensor coverage area for more than 10 seconds, the WASHER using the pusher presses the button and waits for the next movement in front of the toilet.  The sensor is configured for a narrow sector, in front of the toilet.  If you go a little further than the toilet, they will not notice you.  But if you wash your hands in the combined sanitary unit and the toilet is right next to it, situations of determination are not excluded.  However, according to the most conservative estimates, the cost of one flush in our country (6-8 liters) is 0.38-0.56 rubles.  In the shower, much more merges at one time.  And an extra flush will positively affect cleanliness.  For two-button systems, clicking on a small flush saves 20 kopecks.  Of course, a penny saves a ruble, but here as they say - different people have a different approach.  The stem is not centered.  With a slight offset.  Therefore, you can attach the washer to the double button.  It just needs to be positioned so that the stock pushes the button that is in priority. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ce/jo/mn/cejomnhg-o3wu03wjagyjtgqany.png"><br><br>  There are buttons lower and higher.  To do this, the washer provides for changing the height of the hook for the button.  You can push any button, the estimated weight of pressing the mechanism is 3 kg per centime.  It doesn‚Äôt matter how drowned  most mechanisms have a common button stroke. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a80/5c8/804/a805c8804310b56cd712fab66981db9e.gif" alt="image"><br><br><h3>  What is the battery supply and how much is enough? </h3><br>  The device injects a battery from LiPo that can naturally be charged.  As a rule, the charge lasts for one and a half to two months, but if the standard family is 2 + 1 and everything is at work, then for longer.  I was able to find in the Celestial LiPo batteries the right size and the right power.  Now, you can safely charge with a regular charger from your smartphone / tablet.  If desired, the charger can not be turned off at all and used as a power supply and forever forget about the need to charge. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ls/js/33/lsjs33u60redbvvl_tuxkgr2ue8.png"><br><br>  <b>Are you sure that, going down the ‚Äúbig‚Äù, people will leave just like that, without looking at the contents for the last time, and without using a brush, for example.</b> <br><br>  Yes it is, but there are different situations, sometimes a sinner.  He got up, wiped his ass, got distracted by the phone / wife / neighbor / neighbor / children ... etc.  and ran to do other things, forgetting to wash off.  In the end there is a forced descent, which can be used by pressing the button. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/cac/365/02d/cac36502d030aeaee18f8a62459b0833.gif" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>What guarantees that your washer doesn‚Äôt make legs if, for example, it stands in a public place?</b> <br><br>  You can slam everything, the main thing is what will be the consequences.  Once, they asked me - how are you going to protect him from theft if public toilets are interested in your thing?  My thoughts were not that this issue was relevant.  Convinced - it is necessary to protect against theft.  I had to think a crutch.  It looks like this now.  It is lowered, resting on a protective plate (ratchet).  Of course, he will not stop a thief who is biting a thief, but carefully try to remove the WASHER without a long thin device (such as the one that gets a SIM card), you must try. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/20c/807/594/20c807594346a88534e4911475c50cfa.gif" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>Is it possible to add functions to the washer, even somehow rustic ...?</b> <br><br>  Of course.  You can integrate Alice, Siri and connect to skynet ... theoretically, everything is possible. <br>  Another question is how much it will consume energy ... But if on business, you can ponder over to make a differentiated descent.  For example ... people came up.  I stood / sat for a minute (which theoretically means - I didn‚Äôt come for a long time) left, the WASHER made a short press and drained a little water.  If the body sits for a long time or lays its face in the bowl, it means that it has come up with "serious matters", respectively, after leaving the ice for a long time, by hanging a little when the button is pressed. <br><br>  Radical additives such as a built-in radio, a Wi-Fi module for draining information for toilet paper manufacturers, or a welcome ‚Äúhello aaaaasite‚Äù ... and after leaving - ‚Äúwith relief‚Äù, are not seriously considered yet, but have not been deducted from the account.  By the way, the idea was to attach a container with a pleasantly smelling liquid to the WASHER.  The device washed off and poured into the tank through the cracks in the button, a certain gel.  But these are thoughts for the future. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/tj/si/_b/tjsi_bjv7kvpvbvdmw5m8rnls3i.png"><br><br>  <b>Cats</b> <br><br>  Upon learning about my research, several sympathizers expressed the opinion that having the ability to automatically flush water into the toilet, it is necessary to improve the flush, so that it flushes for smart cats who are accustomed to "go" to the toilet.  So there was an external sensor for cats with paws :) It can be placed in the place where the cat is attached to the process and voila, the washer will monitor the movement around the circle and when it leaves, after a pause, in order not to frighten, press the button.  We untie the hands of the owners of smart cats.  We train to the best of smart and get rid of trays and filler.  He has already begun to teach his own.  Bye tight.  But somehow others do it.  I think it will work out with me. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c5a/283/908/c5a283908780e6db831dc8fde1b01aca.gif" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>What can be the selling price in a store, did you start all this for this?</b> <br><br>  Given the current small-scale cost of production, in the current realities of 1299 re.  BUT I believe in the fact that with significant volumes you can get up to a thousand.  But as they say, the base price tag. <br>  Networks will do their own thing.  And I think it will be significantly different from the current one. <br><br>  When the whole process began (2015), the unit cost of the entire list was drawn within 400-500 p.  With large batches, 30-40% cheaper.  Accordingly, on the counter, the product would cost no more than 600 rubles.  Since the idea was implemented in the body, the dollar has become two and a half times more expensive, respectively, and the cost has risen, but according to market research surveys under the glass, many of my friends who are ready to receive it, someone for children in tuberculosis, someone he plans for people with disabilities for both 1,500 and 2,000 rubles, and this is not the limit.  Does anybody want.  Now the device is in the online store for 1299r.  Sales are coming.  Buyers regard the price tag as adequate.  There are no rivals in price and capacity in the functionality of devices in nature.  Buyers, as they say from Kaliningrad to Vladivostok.  There are bourgeois.  50% of the wallets. <br><br>  <b>Why did you make such flowers?</b> <br><br>  These are test prototypes.  But I thought that people need to be given the opportunity to get a wash in the tone of the design of the toilet room.  And simply because, all life, basically, is a brown, dull go-no.  I wanted a holiday.  Dull to do - a lot of mind is not necessary <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/_l/nk/_r/_lnk_rfud8swvwqmi0dweanw0uc.png"><br><br>  <b>Is it possible to make the device even more compact?</b> <br><br>  It is difficult, or not so ... =, it is possible, but we will charge it every week.  There is still a nuance.  If the seat cover is high, then with a very low wash, it will block the view of the sensor, which determines the presence.  In my toilet, it is such a difficult case.  Therefore, now the height is optimal. <br><br>  <b>Why is this necessary at all?</b>  <b>You can‚Äôt find a buyer for this dregs even for 100 rubles!</b> <br><br>  There is a problem - there is a solution, elegant, working.  There are places where it is generally contraindicated to touch anything, especially buttons.  Hospitals, for example.  There are people who are limited in their movements, the elderly, the disabled ... They, too, are not up to the buttons.  There are many places where you can apply and make life easier for people.  But you never know ... But, if there are no tasks or problems, there is no point in getting into your wallet. <br><br>  <b>Do you even know that people in the toilets still have a top tank with a chain or a stick sticks out of the tank because the ball has long been lost ....?</b> <br><br>  Yes I know.  But the hope that once, they will have a special day and everything will change for the better, does not leave me. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/xa/86/qa/xa86qa9hekkdklyootex3aki9jo.png"><br><br><h3>  Epilogue </h3><br>  Wishing to merge the negative and fast: I already heard that nobody needs it, that IT will not be bought by anyone, will not solve the problems for those who still dare to acquire it.  That children will crap everywhere and not rinse.  I already heard everything.  Outside the house, they wash off, they grow up, everything is fine.  The washer is on sale, demand is steady.  I even heard such a reproach that there is no need to engage in garbage, it would be better if you invented a cure for cancer.  I would invent if I were a scientist.  To my 44th, I became what I became, relearning late.  Go to any hardware store.  A huge number of mediocre junk finds its lucky owner and gives earnings to everyone through whose hands it came from the producer to the buyer.  He is inclined to hope that the WASHER will find his buyer.  Came in demand.  With a minimum advertising budget. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/zk/hz/am/zkhzambsup_6inzvj6jky-5fhei.png"><br><br>  Received a PCT certificate, barcodes and test results.  A multi-page business plan has been made.  The project is at the low start stage, most of the work has already been done, it needs a sensible commercial push ...;)) another pun ... <br><br>  PS: I understand that someone will perceive this psto in the format - from you got confused due to some nonsense, you probably live bored ... or - that you are confused, don‚Äôt be lazy to work ... I agree completely.  It all looks a bit advertising, cloying and a little implausible.  I did not build a toilet in the country, did not make repairs on the balcony and did not make a photo report of any FIGS.  Yes, ... and did not become a Skolkovo resident and did not beg for a little budget from the state.  I just wanted to share with you what I had individually, with my own hands and a couple of convolutions.  And the moment ... I have an economic education and had no (absolutely) relationship to electronics, mechanics, design, and typesetting before understanding the topic. <br><br>  I‚Äôm preparing the next post about how I went through relationships with Chinese manufacturers of components and how I managed not to be disappointed in the Middle Kingdom. <br><br>  And yes, I integrated the washer into the overlay for installations of one very famous manufacturer.  The price tag turned out to be five times cheaper than the branded one - and it starts at 32 ... :) <br>  Details in the next article. <br><br>  Answers to several possible questions from Khabrovchan. <br><br><ol><li>  It‚Äôs easier to teach children to wash off after themselves - Yes, Cats - no </li><li>  Brains - AVR </li><li>  Movement - PIR / Light - LDR <br><br>  (There are two modes on PIR: single determination -&gt; flush / multiple determination -&gt; flush. Well, for example. Came up - definition -&gt; Measure, wait -&gt; care for another definition, pause - flush. Total two definitions, only after the second and short pause click on the button.) </li><li>  Own mechanism </li><li>  Acc - Lipo 1100mA </li><li>  Average work time from acc - 10 weeks (4 people) </li><li>  The cost of a mold for one plastic part in the Middle Kingdom is $ 1500-2000 </li><li>  The sensor for cats is external, if you only caught a sensor for a cat, then a pause before flushing for 90 seconds ... so as not to scare. </li></ol><br>  I will be happy to answer other questions. <br><br>  PS And one more moment.  At a certain stage, several washers fell into the hands of the people with whom we agreed on testing and the subsequent replacement of ‚Äúraw‚Äù devices with factory ones.  I am very grateful to them for not being scared, for giving food for the mind and heart.  With this post, I announce the beginning of a revocable company to replace prototypes with factory devices.  The difference between them is space.  I would like to take them back with a replacement, They are actually made by hand and will go to rest in the startup museum - WASHER.  Friends respond! <br><br>  Sincerely, Dmitry L., specially for Habr <br><br>  That's all, soak in the toilet ... </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/461129/">https://habr.com/ru/post/461129/</a></p>
