We continue to collect interesting news from fintech fields, and today we have a small note about fresh national currencies and about attempts to collect from citizens not only internal taxes, but also cryptocurrency. <br><br> <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/alfa/blog/350464/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/sa/eu/3e/saeu3e3hvdj_5n9bvy39wd0b0tw.png"></a> <br>  <i>This is not a ruble badge, but a new cryptocurrency logo - the Venezuelan</i> <br><br><h2>  National cryptocurrencies, beautiful and different </h2><br>  Many countries are now considering the likelihood of the introduction of national cryptocurrency.  But ahead of the rest - Venezuela.  The country, however, develops a crypt, not because all Venezuelan officials are so advanced, but rather out of despair.  Bolivar (local currency) is depreciating with terrible force, the flywheel of inflation is spinning up more and more, so the authorities have to look for new ways to prevent a financial collapse.

      And here cryptocurrencies come to the rescue. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><div class="oembed"><twitter-widget class="twitter-tweet twitter-tweet-rendered" id="twitter-widget-0" style="position: static; visibility: visible; display: block; transform: rotate(0deg); width: 500px; margin: 10px auto; max-width: 100%; min-width: 220px;" data-tweet-id="965757273086877696"></twitter-widget><script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div><br><br>  El Petro, the national cryptocurrency, appeared in the public domain a couple of weeks ago.  According to Maduro, the president of the country, this is the first national cryptocurrency, which is provided with its own reserves and natural resources. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/tr/2g/gj/tr2ggjm84rdqnppjv_efvjg61hu.png"><br><br>  Instructions for those wishing to purchase this miracle blockchain technology <a href="http://www.elpetro.gob.ve/">is here</a> .  Natural wealth means oil - all 5 billion black gold from Venezuela. <br><br>  Turkey is not going to fall behind either.  Here, local politicians with might and main promote the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãa national cryptocurrency.  The name she can get is not too complicated - ‚ÄúTurcoin‚Äù (Turcoin).  The technical details of the project remain unknown, but many state and private companies will be able to work with these tools, including Turkish Airlines, the Istanbul Stock Exchange and Turk Telekom. <br><br>  Unexpectedly, Iran was added to the list of people who wanted to enter their own cryptocurrency.  Moreover, the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãintroducing cryptocurrency was proposed not by some politician, a representative of the party, but by the Minister of Information and Communication Technologies Azari Jahromi himself.  As in the previous case, the technical details are not yet known. <br><br><h2>  Taxes take Bitcoin </h2><br>  Bitcoins are now being used as a means of payment.  Despite the volatility of the course, the cryptocurrency still remains a more or less popular tool for mutual settlements.  In Georgia, they decided to go further, and make Bitcoin a means of payment for settlements of citizens with the state.  In other words, it was proposed to levy taxes using cryptomonet.  The bill, by the way, is ready and <a href="http://www.legis.ga.gov/Legislation/20172018/174462.pdf">readable</a> . <br><br>  As far as can be understood, the Georgian parliamentarians decided to repeat the experience of Arizona, where they also offered to collect taxes with Bitcoins.  True, in the US, the bill appeared a month earlier - <br>  in January.  If the adoption of the bill goes smoothly, Arizona can become the first US state where tax deductions will be made by citizens in Bitcoins. <br><br> <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/arizona-lawmakers-want-let-people-pay-taxes-bitcoin"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/pl/pn/ax/plpnaxxhlxskmurhnsn1_yjz0xa.png"><br></a> <br><br>  True, there is no guarantee that both bills will be missed by parliamentarians.  But if everything works out, it will be a precedent for everyone, and, most likely, other countries will be interested in this practice. <br><br>  By the way, the other day the results of the study, which was conducted by the NAFI Analytical Center together with the Russian Microfinance Center and the Citi Foundation in January-February 2018, were published.  The study dealt with such topics as financial literacy of the population.  So, about half of the polled Russians answered that they would like to improve their financial literacy. <br><br>  What for?  Citizens do not always understand the specifics of working with financial organizations and their products, so many are dissatisfied with their knowledge in this area.  And such <a href="https://ria.ru/society/20180220/1515006903.html">dissatisfied - 44%</a> . <br><br>  For now, for now, we are waiting for news from the FINTECH front and are following the events. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/350464/">https://habr.com/ru/post/350464/</a></p>
