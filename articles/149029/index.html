Since I have the opportunity to communicate with customers directly, I have highlighted several points for myself that can increase their loyalty and tune in to one wave.  A satisfied customer will recommend you to his friends and partners, or he will contact you with new projects. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h4>  1. Respond promptly to customer requests </h4><br>  This does not mean that you need to answer a phone call or mail at 23:00, but timely response to requests can magically increase loyalty to you.  Recall, for example, your reaction when you make a request to the online store, and the manager-linan contact with you after two days.  And wah effect when in 5-10 minutes.  Feel the difference?

    <h4>  2. Stick to deadlines </h4><br>  The client, in fact, has only two requirements for you: you should always do your work as expectedly well and within the stipulated time frame.  I emphasize that it is rare that it puts a demand that you jump over yourself, this initiative can only be on your part.  The client needs a result, and if it is not there by 5:59 pm this Friday, all your sufferings to one place. <br><br><h4>  3. Be honest </h4><br>  This item comes up from the previous one.  When you, nevertheless, do not have time to do the work on time, you do not need to ‚Äúfreeze‚Äù, ignoring the customer‚Äôs calls.  Checked, it is better to warn yourself about the delay and set new deadlines.  Typically, customers normally refer to this. <br><br><h4>  4. Keep your customer informed </h4><br>  You know that you are currently working on a client‚Äôs project, but he doesn‚Äôt know it.  Make more control points during the implementation process and make regular reports.  If you are an advanced designer and work in one of the project management systems, then provide the client with guest access to the project and he himself will be able to track the progress of work. <br><br><h4>  5. Synchronize customer expectations with your </h4><br>  The designer does not just have to understand what is required of him, he must clearly and specifically agree with the client on what and in what format it will be done.  For example, the result of our work will be a set of page layouts in the .psd format. <br><br>  Golden rule with straziki - everything that can be misunderstood will necessarily be misunderstood.  An example from practice: the client orders the design of the site, and as a result, as it turned out, he took all the texts to ‚Äúdesign‚Äù, because they also exist on the site, and this is still the week of the copywriter's life. <br><br><h4>  6. Goals and objectives are most important. </h4><br>  What is the difference between artists and designers?  And the fact that we, the designers, are solving very specific tasks, and not self-actualizing.  Therefore, if a photo of a kitten on the main page helps to increase sales by 100,500 times, push your ‚Äúfe‚Äù away. <br><br><h4>  7. Do not consider yourself smarter than customers. </h4><br>  If you want to reach a maximum understanding, use the same terms as the client.  After all, no one likes to feel stupid.  And you should not give the client links to articles like " <a href="http://f26.ru/txt/fontplay/">Game with fonts</a> " for enlightenment. <br><br><h4>  8. Take a prepayment </h4><br>  It is not always necessary to do work for money, but if you finally decide to make money - take a prepayment.  Because: <br><ol><li>  it shows the client‚Äôs willingness to work with you and his solvency; </li><li>  it disciplines you.  By taking the money in advance, you take the responsibility to do the work on time; </li><li>  There are projects that are delayed for a couple of months through no fault of yours.  Prepay makes it possible not to sit on the beans while work is in progress. </li></ol><br><br><h4>  9. Do not let money get to you. </h4><br>  Very often, the client is a busy person, and in order to meet you in person or go to some rare branch of the bank, he needs to allocate special time for this.  And instead of receiving payment on the same day, you can wait several days until he has free time.  Therefore, provide the client with as many payment options as possible for your labor: cash, money transfers, card accounts (most common banks), Yandex.Money, webmoney, etc. <br><br><h4>  10. Do not go down to the level of market women </h4><br>  Rarely, but still there are situations when a client communicates with you sharply.  Do not aggravate the situation with the words ‚Äúfool himself‚Äù, but try to understand the reasons for such a reaction.  In an extreme case, a phrase like ‚Äúif you continue further in the same tone, we end the cooperation and leave prepayment‚Äù should refresh the hot client. <br><br><h4>  11. Pleasantly surprise customers. </h4><br>  Doing your work try not only to do it efficiently, but also so that the client is satisfied with the cooperation with you.  Make free ‚Äú <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/124574/">buns</a> ‚Äù (for example, <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/123779/">branded envelopes</a> ) that will pleasantly surprise a client and set you apart from others. <br><br><h4>  12. A mailed idea is a dead idea. </h4><br>  If possible, try to present everything live.  Since no one understands your thoughts better than you, and the ability to quickly explain with words the rationality of certain decisions can save a lot of time and nerves. <br><br>  Are you afraid to speak to people?  Sign up for acting classes and in two weeks your charisma and self-confidence will increase by 5-10 centimeters :) <br><br>  <i><sup>This article is also available in the <a href="http://prodesign.in.ua/2012/08/12-rechej-pro-yaki-varto-pamyataty-v-roboti-z-klijentamy/">Ukrainian translation</a> .</sup></i> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/149029/">https://habr.com/ru/post/149029/</a></p>
