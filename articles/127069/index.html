  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Customer: self-defense basics</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Customer: self-defense basics <br><br>  Customer communication with the performer is an eternal theme.  How many copies have been broken, how many words of all sorts of bad things are said, but still the problem has lived, lives and will live, like the work of Lenin in the minds of the followers.  However, such "conversations" are quite different from each other, as, indeed, the customers themselves.  What to do in each case?  Let's figure it out! <br><br>  <b>1. Dunno or "Find something, I do not know what"</b> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/fa6/363/19a/fa636319ab4f0724ac1ce8f630db3daf.jpg" alt="image" align="left">  Such a dialogue is probably the most common and usually includes a single phrase that completely negates all attempts to clarify the requirements: ‚ÄúWell, you are a developer / admin / programmer / All-Seeing Eye (underline)!  You know better how it should be! ‚ÄùOf course, we geniuses know everything.  But hint something you can?  Then already the options will appear, and the details will be clarified, and there will be ‚Äúthe very thing‚Äù from which the customer will be pleased, and the performer will increase the rating and fill up the wallet.  Otherwise, everything is useless, ‚ÄúAles Kaput!‚Äù, As German colleagues say. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  What to do: to offer options, but in advance to choose the most interesting.  And to convince that the proposed is the most fashionable-effective-user-friendly.  All will be satisfied, because the customer is already initially ready to admit that you are right.

      <b>2. Negative or ‚ÄúDon't like and that's it‚Äù</b> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/243/995/887/243995887e93c82d263c941f457892ed.jpg" alt="image" align="left">  Probably the most embarrassing moment.  For ‚Äúdislike‚Äù in this case is abstract and not supported by even the simplest arguments.  Attempts to offer alternatives are doomed to failure from the outset - here it is a matter of principle.  "I am the boss, you are a fool," nothing else.  Yes, the task is not easy, but with the right decision, the client will leave satisfied and will later trust unconditionally. <br><br>  What to do: look for these very arguments and specific quibbles.  It is impossible not to like everything.  We'll have to remember the classic: ‚ÄúDo you have any complaints about the buttons?‚Äù And so on all points.  In the end, the vis-a-vis will understand that the option proposed to him is practically a masterpiece.  Everyone is happy, everyone is happy, peace, friendship, chewing gum. <br><br><br>  <b>3. The dictator or "And I want it that way!"</b> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/064/6ba/bfe/0646babfe6acca6dcb138e235781c127.jpg" alt="image" align="left">  It is also extremely difficult option - to prove their case in the usual way is impossible.  You have one argument, another, the third one to the customer, and he insists: ‚ÄúI want this and that‚Äôs it.‚Äù And you don‚Äôt go against the rule about ‚Äúeternal client rightness‚Äù.  For he wants so.  Despite the logic and common sense.  The situation is difficult, because you want to climb on the tree, and the sirloin is not wounded. <br><br>  What to do: the arguments, as I said, do not work.  Verified  But there are workarounds: <br>  - if something can be improved without touching the appearance and functionality, then you need to do it (for example, use a different technology). <br>  - if it is impossible to improve ‚Äúimperceptibly‚Äù, then you should offer to think on the topic ‚ÄúIs it necessary for all users?‚Äù Maybe it will not be able to be seen by those who log into the network through the extremely popular iPhone today?  Is it worth sacrificing a large part of the audience for doubtful beauties? <br>  - think, is not it better to leave as requested?  If the ‚Äúleave‚Äù option goes against the logic and convenience for the user, then refuse such an order.  Otherwise, such ‚Äúanti-advertising‚Äù will be more expensive for itself later. <br><br>  <b>4. Diplomat or ‚ÄúAnd let's discuss!‚Äù</b> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/880/138/afb/880138afbfc4ba7f89c532e3301dd63e.jpg" alt="image" align="left">  It differs from all others in that it is ready to conduct a dialogue.  Not a monologue, not making requests and complaints, but a dialogue.  It can quite accurately describe the desired result and is ready to work together with the performer.  Yes, he can discuss every little thing, but in the end, everyone is extremely pleased.  It occurs infrequently, but if you suddenly met, then everything, happiness can be considered accomplished. <br><br>  What to do: what to do?  To preserve such a unique thing, to try to catch the slightest desire and to please.  After all, he is so rare!  A kind of magic wand, a lucky ticket.  And in this case, under no circumstances can you violate the terms.  They should not be broken at all, but this person can be extremely helpful.  As a rule, such people are willing to pay good money and / or recommend you to their friends.  And ties, as we know, are not scattered. <br><br>  Of course, for each person you need your own approach, and very rarely there are people who can be ranked as one type.  It is important to understand how to identify these types and work together.  There are many ways to understand who is in front of you: the tone of speech, the appeal in real communication and in correspondence, the nature of the requirements for the project, up to the documented.  In addition to their own experience, books on psychology (including NLP), a communication coach, and training on experimental subjects (employees, friends, relatives) can help you in solving problems in customer communication.  The most important thing is to understand what the customer needs and why, and how it‚Äôs as clear as possible to offer him a solution to the tasks set and discuss it. <br><br>  I sincerely wish that all customers were diplomats.  Well, if not lucky, then you know how to find ways to turn everything in their favor. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/127069/">https://habr.com/ru/post/127069/</a></p>
