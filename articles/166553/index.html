And, until the time has come a special, spring, I want to recall the holidays held in a circle of colleagues.  I will start the narration from the previous year, in order not to go deep into the historical jungle, and to create some idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe established traditions. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  New Year's corporate party 2011, we spent in the hall "Aura" RK "Boomerang".  What would have been more fun, we decided to make our New Year's Eve costumed, and whoever was in what was ready for that, although some connection with the fairy tale ‚ÄúAlice in Wonderland‚Äù was assumed. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/171/313/b39/171313b3942337a5b4c622f87f7aa3bc.png">

      The program of the presenters with competitions and tasks, performances of creative teams - all this turned out to be interesting: it was given an opportunity to think about it and there was something to please the eye. <br><br>  But we ourselves did not miss the guys (which, of course, is noticeable to the naked eye) and at the end of the prepared program we did not crawl into the corners to finish the festive dinner.  The fun continued for a long time, we stood the dance marathon with a bang! <br><br>  Vacations that year also passed quickly, and he himself flew, frankly, without brakes!  And the winter holidays crept up again. <br><br>  Here is the new year on the threshold!  New plans, hopes, dreams.  And again we have corporate!  This time the venue for the event was the recently opened Appelbar.  Beautiful room, delicious food and drinks and, of course, costumes for creating and maintaining a festive mood.  The theme of the party is the ‚ÄúNew Year Scam‚Äù (based on the movie ‚ÄúThe Scam of Thomas Crown‚Äù), and at the appointed hour performed by our employees Appelbar were filled with speculators of various kinds and scale. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/55e/58c/951/55e58c95190ef4a3957728515d342596.jpg"><br><br>  At the end of 2012, we conducted a survey among our employees, which showed that many of us would like to know the current state of affairs in the company.  Upon learning of this, we tried and prepared for the children a report on the work done during the year, where the heads of the divisions spoke about the work of their departments, and we learned in numbers, percentages and shares how the company is developing, what we have in the present and what plans and goals we have in the future. <br><br>  At the party we finished the game in Secret Santa, and everyone who took part in it received his New Year's gift! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/36b/c7e/1fa/36bc7e1fac1199095a490d987141b5cf.jpg"><br><br>  The holiday, as usual, lasted until the ‚Äúlast survivor‚Äù, and the next day we met again to continue work. <br><br>  And also, the company has its own Santa Claus and Snow Maiden, who congratulate the children of employees on the new year!  Already many times they, in a sleigh of two hundred and fifty reindeer forces, fly along the roads of Irkutsk and the surrounding area, listen to poems, songs, etc., carefully prepared by children, and present gifts to all the girls and boys who behaved well in the outgoing year. <br><br>  Then most of us went back for a great vacation, to rest and gather strength for further accomplishments. <br><br>  It seems that all this has happened recently, but the rays of the spring sun are already joyfully warming through the window glass pale organisms with the first signs of avitinosis.  Not that I love winter, and especially New Year's bustle, but it is pleasant to remember. <br><br>  And it's good that spring is coming! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/166553/">https://habr.com/ru/post/166553/</a></p>
