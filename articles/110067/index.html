Traffic jams, queues at the savings bank, boring lectures, a girl and a half hour waiting.  I want to spend time with more benefit or to entertain myself.  I think, like many habrayuzerov, have favorite serials.  On modern smartphones with large screens they are quite comfortable to watch.  But for all actions: torrent ‚Üí video conversion ‚Üí file uploading via cable, it took too much time. <br>  I have long been waiting for such a service, thanks to which the new series of my favorite TV shows would miraculously get to me on my smartphone.  I didn't wait and <b>did it myself</b> ... <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  What is it?  Like this? </h4><br>  Video podcasts are a great video delivery tool, I thought, and created the <a href="http://mp4serial.ru/">Serial On The Road</a> service.  Everything is very simple: <br><ul><li>  We go to the site, choose your favorite serials, or form your personalized tape from your favorite TV shows </li><li>  Copy the link (s) to the rss feed in your smartphone </li><li>  If necessary, set up the application so that the video is automatically downloaded, for example at night, or when home Wi-Fi appears in view. </li><li>  <s>profit</s> Enjoy TV shows on the road ... </li></ul><br>  At the moment, the work has been tested on Symbian OS, where in the latest models of phones, there is a standard tool for working with video podcasts (‚ÄúVideo Center‚Äù) and on Android OS, where you need to install a separate application that would work with video podcasts.  If you are unable to use video podcasts, you can simply go to the site from a mobile phone and download the video for a direct link (mp4, mpeg4 codec) <br>  As a result, when I wake up in the morning, I see something like this on my Nokia 5800: <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/582c5be6/101fb5a6/7b4bfa12/4d281238.png"></div>

    <h4>  Where do TV shows come from? </h4><br>  They are added by users.  On the site, each series has a button "I have a new series."  If you really have it, just upload it to the site, and it will convert the video yourself, and in a couple of minutes the new series will be available to everyone. <br>  If the list does not contain your favorite series, then you can ask to add it by clicking on "I want another series." <br>  I want to note that the service was not calculated to view the entire season of the series, but was made to view new series, so you shouldn‚Äôt flood the entire season, it‚Äôs enough to be limited to the last few episodes. <br>  <b>ATTENTION!!!</b>  In the case of acts of vandalism, the ability to upload video will be disabled for mere mortals.  Do not create difficulties for normal users of the free service. <br><br><h4>  Is it really free? </h4><br>  Yes, it's free.  Even despite the fact that I pay from my own pocket for converting video to a third-party service.  I am not going to monetize the service, however, I hope for donations that will possibly cover the costs of the service.  If it‚Äôs okay to donate, I want to give small bonuses to active video uploads.  The number of available TV shows will also be available depending on the donations. <br><br><h4>  And how is this done? </h4><br>  The site turns on weak vds.  Written in python, using the web.py framework.  Was written for a couple of evenings.  The key moment of the service is video conversion and storage.  I just used the services of the <a href="http://encodeit.org/">encode.org</a> service, which was recently <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/personal/108567/">announced</a> in Habr√©. <br>  Video is uploaded through the widget directly to their server, where it is converted quite quickly.  Next, their server sends me a POST request, which contains exhaustive information on the recoded video, as well as a direct link to the file.  All this just falls into my database. <br><br><h5>  So, I hope the service <a href="http://mp4serial.ru/">mp4serial.ru</a> will be useful to you. </h5></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/110067/">https://habr.com/ru/post/110067/</a></p>
