Addition to the 2nd principle of Deming</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  I decided to make an addition to Deming's second principle (new philosophy) to say about kaizen. <br><br>  When I talked about Deming's second principle, I often jumped on the table with my legs and shouted.  This certainly affected the presentation of the meaning of what I wanted to convey.  Let's be prim and cultured. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <strong>New philosophy is a rethinking of business.</strong> <br><br>  When you try to understand the meaning of a business, the following questions are definitely related to each other:

      Attitude to life; <br>  Method vs Result; <br>  Product (service); <br>  Consumer (people). <br><br>  The whole difficulty is to gracefully arrange these substances in your head. <br><br>  <strong>Kaizen</strong> <br><br>  The idea of ‚Äã‚Äãcontinuous improvement, mentioned in the first principle of Deming (constancy of purpose), lies at the heart of the new philosophy.  In Japanese, this idea is called "kaizen." <br><br>  ("Kai") means to change, to correct; <br>  ("Zen") means "good," "good." <br><br>  Kaizen is a philosophy that is not just a part of Japanese consciousness: kaizen only dominates their lives.  Take the samurai.  Take the "Seagull by the name of Jonathan Livingston."  Take the Chess Novel.  These texts will give you an idea of ‚Äã‚Äãwhat kaizen is in general terms. <br><br>  In Western thinking, there is a paraphrase of the notion of kaizen - perfectionism.  The difference between perfectionism and kaizen is that, as a rule, perfectionism occupies a certain place in your brain - somewhere between the resort where you like to relax, the team you are sick of, and the cafe where you prefer to eat shawarma.  I want to say that perfectionism in most cases is a fad, an ant in your head that wakes up when you, for example, leaf through a document with grammatical errors. <br><br>  The word "perfectionism" is associated with "mania" and "complex", and therefore sometimes people are afraid that perfectionism would not begin to dominate their lives, if they are at all inclined to it. <br><br>  Japan consists of approximately 100% perfectionist maniacs. <br><br>  Go, for example, in the "Carousel".  All these wooden pallets with tons of some half-opened boxes between the racks look terribly careless.  In Japan, you will not find this even in production.  Go to Dixie if you want to clearly understand what I mean.  Paphos is that our carelessness is not perceived as a problem. <br><br>  Imagine a professional table tennis player. <br><br>  What does he care about: <br><br>  master the technique; <br>  achieve reproducible performance; <br>  bring the technique to grace; <br>  achieve mastery of performance; <br>  come to perfection in the game. <br><br>  What he does not care about at least until he became a master: <br><br>  rivals; <br>  viewers; <br>  score. <br><br>  When you are absorbed in something - sports, cars, code writing, books - you are able to attach crucial importance to the details of the process itself.  And when you are absorbed in something professionally, you polish the process, improve it.  The process is the only, perhaps, value for you.  This is kaizen. <br><br>  When management seeks profit, and when management seeks everyone in their company to seek profit, management demonstrates that it simply does not know what to do and is unable to manage.  Imagine a coach who demands a result from a chess player.  The result does not come from demands, not from financial (and generally external) motivation, but from owning the process, i.e.  method.  A chess player will strive to master the technique every day, all the time.  It does not focus on results in the form of process outputs. <br><br>  Kaizen does not allow negligence.  Negligence is contrary to the meaning of kaizen. <br>  However, concentration at the exit (profits, terms, etc.) causes negligence.  The negligence that employees allow is ignored when they want money or deadlines.  The phrase ‚Äúcontinuous improvement‚Äù is meaningless if the firm is not properly focused.  Although it is the carelessness that spoils the whole thing, nothing is probably ignored as persistently as carelessness due to improper focusing.  Negligence due to incorrect focusing generates tons of concept products.  There are wheels, there is a body, there is a steering wheel, brakes, engine, transmission - everything is there (the concept of the car is observed), but it is terrible to drive it, if this is done, for example, on Avtovaz. <br><br>  <strong>Kaizen is nothing.</strong>  <strong>Kaizen is like.</strong> <br><br>  Management is focused on profits and terms, not because perfectionism is not in fashion (if you take an extreme case, imagine the degree of general annoyance when the designer draws a banner for a month or a year), but because he misunderstood the meaning of what he was .  In most cases, management does not want to hear anything about how something will be done.  Moreover, in most cases, management does not understand how something is being done.  Management is used to living in an atmosphere detached from the world of three dimensions, spinning among "goals", "profits" and "deadlines."  Management sleeps and sees how everything is formed by itself and ‚Äúgoals will be achieved‚Äù.  Or, on the contrary, management prefers to get into everything, imagining itself to be an organizational genius.  After such raids, it takes a couple of hours or a couple of days for the employees to step back from the stress and start from where they left off. <br><br>  Imagine again a coach who demands a result from a chess player.  Add to this the fact that the coach states that he has no idea and he doesn‚Äôt give a damn how this will be done (and how this is generally done), but in the five-year plan there must be a chess crown.  Obviously, this coach did not understand his mission. <br><br>  ‚ÄúReplace leadership with leadership,‚Äù says Deming.  I will speak in detail about the meaning of this phrase when describing the following principles of Deming, especially the eleventh one, where this phrase sounds twice.  Now I will say that if management does not know how something is being done, then it is doomed to live in the world created by itself. <br><br>  A product, a service, a society (employees, consumers, suppliers, partners) - all this sets a peculiar corridor of business.  The product and the consumer are the beacons of the company, which do not include profits and generally measured results.  The content of the business should revolve around your attitude to life, product (services), people and improved methods.  This is the meaning of business. <br><br>  Kaizen does not restrict business freedom: he does not say whether to make a Web 2.0 product or to extract the E211 preservative from mayonnaise.  Kaizen is an attitude towards life.  You can fill your life with anything.  You can try to decompose kaizen into parts: <br><br>  attention to detail; <br>  improvement; <br>  reproducibility of the process; <br>  the importance of methods; <br>  accuracy; <br>  etc. <br><br>  But it is better to just grasp the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãkaizen as a whole.  Try to improve yourself constantly and you will start practicing kaizen. <br><br>  Tomorrow I will tell you about the dependence on quality control. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/24778/">https://habr.com/ru/post/24778/</a></p>
