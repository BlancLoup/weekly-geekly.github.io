And this is a very important point when choosing the right virtual server.

      In the offers of hosting providers you can often find two types of virtualization - <b>OpenVZ</b> and <b>KVM</b> .  And in both there are both their advantages and disadvantages.  The main reasons for the dislike of OpenVZ is that many providers use large oversell on their nodes, since virtualization allows you to resell multiple times, both CPU and RAM.  As a result, providers who want to earn the maximum, with a minimum of expenses, fill the nodes with as many subscribers as possible, completely forgetting that customers will grow.  Approaching the real 100% resource consumption of the node.  However, hardware virtualization KVM is also not without a flaw that allows you to resell resources many times, but there it is possible to resell many times only CPU, RAM is allocated strictly and guaranteed.  That reduces the possibility of oversell. <br><br>  In his article <a href="https://habr.com/company/ua-hosting/blog/347386/">The Truth About VPS (KVM) E5-2650 v4 (6 Cores) 10GB DDR4 240GB SSD 1Gbps from $ 20 or how to share the server correctly?</a>  we told how we share servers, and that <b>even we use oversell</b> , only in such a way that everyone is guaranteed to receive the resource allocated to him.  And in principle, if we forget about the disadvantage that it is impossible to install Windows on <b>OpenVZ</b> , then this virtualization would be even better, since it would allow (in our case) to consume RAM more optimally, because according to statistics, even 50% of the RAM that we allocate customers not consumed by them.  No, we would not increase the number of users.  In no case.  We would simply allow those who consume 100% of RAM, at a time when resources are free from other customers and they need them, to consume more.  For what?  For the common good, additional RAM would allow for faster processing of tasks, which would reduce the load on the CPU, since the process would run faster, the queue for processing subsequent interrupts would be released faster, which in general, however surprising it might be, would reduce consumption, including RAM. <br><br>  Because not always VPS with OpenVZ is bad.  Everything depends only on the provider who implements the solution and on its greed. <br><br>  And what is the main disadvantage of modern VPS?  This is primarily a repository.  As a rule, shared storage of the type NetApp is implemented in order to reduce the number of units and servers that serve the infrastructure.  And if it is implemented on the SSD - this is not the worst option.  However, the performance of such a decision depends on many factors and the project may contain many ‚Äúbottlenecks‚Äù, as a result - resources may not be utilized very evenly, resulting in additional latency.  At the same time, it allows the provider to dispose of CPUs with a maximum oversell indicator, which leads to the fact that vCPUs allocated to users do not all have anything in common with the vCPU performance that a user receives when placing a VPS not in the cloud, but on a single bare-metal server.  By the way, we ourselves sold VPS (KVM) of this type, implemented on the old E3-1230 platforms, which the data center disposed of in the cloud.  The price of the service was rather low and ranged from $ 3.99 a month for: <br><br>  [S] <br><br>  Kernels (vCPU) 1 Core <br>  Memory (vRAM) 1 GB <br>  40 GB quota (SSD Storage) <br>  1000 Mbps port <br>  Premium traffic 4 TB <br>  Filtering DDOS attacks up to 1 Gbps for free <br>  From $ 3.99 / month depending on location <br><br>  But the service had many flaws.  So, for example, the number of IOPS per user per 1000 was limited. It would seem a lot, more than an HDD can provide by an order of magnitude.  However, there was a moment, if we won in the case of random write or read, in the case of linear sequential read / write, and not random, we got the maximum performance much lower than any single hard disk could provide.  We were criticized for it.  However, the service was cheaper than an IP address, and contained a real IP, which cost more a cent on sale.  There were other drawbacks, the performance at a single moment could change significantly if we did the measurements.  Of course, for such money, it would be wrong to make any claims here, but nevertheless, the service did not provide what could be provided by shared-hosting, which could be 4 times cheaper and <a href="https://ua-hosting.company/hosting">cost us $ 0.99 / month</a> , without limited you to consumed resources, and limited only traffic that can be purchased at a price known in advance.  The very concept of our hosting is described <a href="https://habr.com/company/ua-hosting/blog/318290/">in this small article</a> . <br><br>  Thus, if you don‚Äôt need root access, you don‚Äôt definitely need a cheap virtual server to fine tune your scripts and applications, specific operating systems or build VPN tunnels. <br><br>  But the truth is that you don‚Äôt need it even in cases when all of the above is required, except maybe a VPN and some tasks not related to live sites.  Why? <br><br>  It is no secret that search engines rank websites according to such indicators as behavioral factors that are influenced, including the speed of page generation. <br><br>  Behavioral factors determine the visitor's behavior on your site, how far he goes, how many pages of the third and second level he visits, how long he lingers on a particular page, or perhaps the charter to wait, or considering the site‚Äôs work uncomfortable for him ‚Äî leaves.  Especially they appear at peak moments of attendance, because visitors to your site, and accordingly, the load created by them, is distributed unevenly throughout the day.  Also, do not forget about the attendance surges in connection with some events and holidays, when the number of requests for which your site is relevant is increasing. <br><br>  Of course, VPS has evolved very much over the past years, but cheap VPS still do not have sufficient resources to optimally handle such attendance peaks.  In particular, if you run applications, namely CMS, free, not optimized, with a large number of modules.  The problem is still alive when a user installs WordPress on a virtual server, and a lot of modules with him, and entering this wonderful installation, causes 100% load on his VPS and, as a result, error timeout for certain actions with the site. <br><br>  And this is not normal.  And there‚Äôs no fault of the user who lacked the resources, but the provider who sells such VPS to beginners, and they have problems with them because of their inexperience, losing any enthusiasm for further work.  After all, not everyone who is correct and knowledgeable will want to engage in optimization initially.  On hosting, such peak loads in most cases are leveled, since the processor is quite powerful and such peaks occur at different times only if the provider does not set a limit in the form of processor minutes that a user can use or restrictions on the duration of a process.  And on a virtual server with a small amount of resources, this will be noticeable anyway.  And when the user's site ‚Äúgrows up‚Äù and starts making first profit on such a cheap VPS, it will happily rejoice that ‚Äúoops‚Äù, but you would have better resources, and such a VPS will cost more ... As a result, beginners ‚Äúbreak off ¬ªTheir enthusiasm, and if hosting projects such projects grow to a certain scale from the" cradle ", then at low-cost VPS they will surely die.  After all, the user will not know why their attendance has grown to a certain limit and is no longer growing, and the reason is behavioral factors, when peak attendance is ‚Äúcut off‚Äù due to lack of resources and the resource starts to be ranked lower, thereby reducing the influx of new visitors to the site from the search and so constantly.  According to the results, the user never becomes interested in paying more, as he has the impression that all the earnings are collected by the provider. <br><br>  So good or bad, if offered VPS for 200 rubles?  Of course, for developers who understand what they are doing and who don‚Äôt need much, this is good, but for webmasters who are just starting their journey, no.  This is a huge harm.  We harm beginner webmasters by offering low-cost services with a small amount of resources.  They start saving on panels, installing free solutions, since a panel for such VPS cannot be included in the price, and pay as much for VPS as the panel itself costs - no, that‚Äôs too much for them ... A beginner webmaster simply not ready or just a goon.  After all, very often people feel sorry for themselves, not to mention greed for others.  And to pay the provider extra money and not dispose of everything to the full - our "Slavic" soul can not afford.  Because of this, dishonest dumping and constant price collapses, low quality, and great difficulty in finding a really high-quality provider.  People do not value their time and, following the results, spend it nowhere, using cheap and low-quality services for their own projects, depriving themselves of the opportunity to make a truly successful resource. <br><br>  Therefore, my advice to you is to remain a user of the hosting for as long as possible, but only of course in cases if you do not cut resources and you do not begin to slow down there.  After all, there is included in the price and free maintenance with the monitoring of the node as a whole.  However, hosting hosting is different, but this is a separate topic for conversation.  And as soon as your project grows from a ‚Äúcradle‚Äù to the scale of a VPS, take at once a more or less decent option that includes enough resources, new processors, fast storage and a control panel are included in the price.  And it goes without saying that it cannot cost less than $ 15 a month, like 10 years ago, only resources are now provided for this money much more, as well as related opportunities. <br><br>  Moreover, 15 dollars today is much less money than 15 dollars 10 years ago.  And if you feel in yourself the enthusiasm to succeed - probably you need to immediately start with VPS and you will achieve this success.  I have never used hosting for my websites and tried not to save on matches, even back in 2006, when I first posted my personal website on the Internet devoted to science - Astronomy.  It motivated me to do something.  True, I did not in that direction afterwards (not in the direction of the development of an astronomical resource, as I began to receive money for the site‚Äôs content from hosting, but I didn‚Äôt have enough time to work on my hobby, all the time I spent on customer support and help them with hosting them, already finished projects, which was much more interesting for me), and this led to what is described in the article <a href="https://habr.com/company/ua-hosting/blog/270735/">‚Äúua-hosting.company‚Äù or how to become a hosting provider from scratch and generate traffic more than the whole of Belarus</a> . <br><br>  Perhaps in the process you will also become hosting providers or any other entrepreneurs and radically change their interests.  This is not bad, but the fact that you can now rent, albeit not the cheapest, but good VPS - definitely.  You may not know everything that you will do now, but you will understand if you want, of course, so that the funds are not spent in vain and there will be a desire to get some experience.  And the experience is worth a lot.  And he says that on a too cheap virtual server you will expect an unpleasant surprise and experience (as in the form of slow storage, as I once encountered, that I ran into storage resources before I spent 10% of VPS resources on OpenVZ) do not do this.  Do not step on the same rake, sometimes it is useful to learn from the mistakes of others.  And we also learn.  We had a good margin when selling a cloud-based data center product, but this summer we stopped doing this, abandoning the margin in favor of the new product - VPS (KVM) on NVMe, which is essentially similar in performance to our other product - VPS (KVM) on dedicated drives, with the exception of a few important points: <br><br><ul><li>  it is 2 times cheaper; </li><li>  the minimum amount of a PCIe NVMe drive 1.6TB, it is 3 times faster for writing and up to 10 times for reading in comparison with standard solid-state SSD, as a result we distribute it among up to 15 clients; </li><li>  You can copy the image of your VPS to your local storage; </li><li>  You can upgrade resources up to 24 cores, 40GB DDR4 RAM, 900GB NVMe SSD, 75 TB of traffic at speeds up to 1 Gbit / s.  Additional traffic is available without restrictions, but we can easily migrate you to a dedicated server. </li></ul><br>  And this is all from the price of $ 15, and taking into account the 30% discount that we offer you on the first payment on the promotional code in this article <a href="https://habr.com/company/ua-hosting/blog/347386/">The whole truth about VPS (KVM) E5-2650 v4 (6 Cores) 10GB DDR4 240GB SSD 1Gbps from $ 20 or how to share the server?</a>  (options are available with RAID1 and RAID10, up to 24 cores and up to 40GB DDR4), even cheaper. <br><br>  Moreover, we now have a special offer: <br><br>  <b>VPS (KVM) E5-2650 v4 (6 Cores) 10GB DDR4 240GB SSD 1Gbps until December for free</b> if you pay for a period of six months, you can order <a href="https://ua-hosting.company/vpsnl">here</a> . <br><br>  Yes, I can say that we have the best deals at the moment in terms of price / quality ratio.  Who does not believe - can check, <b>we are ready to provide all registered users of Habr</b> who can leave comments without the need for approval, any of <b>our virtual servers for testing for up to two weeks for free (and the specified promotional VPS with 240GB SSD for a month)</b> , provided providing test results to us with graphs and descriptions in this article within 3 days after the issue.  To do this, write in the comments number of the order, and under it, within 3 days after the issue - do not forget to leave your results. <br><br>  Finally, I‚Äôll tell you a little about hosting directories and why it‚Äôs not advisable to search there.  It‚Äôs no secret that hosting directories make money on affiliate programs, of course, that they will rank higher than the highest-quality hosting provider, but the one who pays them more affiliate deductions from one transition.  Sad, but true.  Everywhere business.  Like Google, directories are far from philanthropic.  And those that are more objective - you can count on the fingers of one hand and find their real luck.  But they will not help you, they will not allow to fully appreciate: <br><br><ul><li>  the level of support of the hosting provider; </li><li>  real performance and node load, degree of oversell; </li><li>  the hidden limitations that each of the proposals certainly has and the presence of bottlenecks, where even a synthetic test conducted at different times of the day may not show a reliable result, due to unrealistic load testing (when one of the parameters increases uncorrelatedly relative to another , in the correlated version, a bottleneck may occur, which will not allow reaching the peak achieved as a result of the synthetic test); </li><li>  connectivity to your audience. </li></ul><br>  Therefore, the choice must be made in everything not according to the catalog, but according to such criteria as: <br><br><ul><li>  connectivity, good channels between the VPS and your audience, sufficient connection capacity to ensure the generation of traffic to your postils during peak hours; </li><li>  as little as possible overloaded storage (specify whether it is shared or not and if shared then what type of drives, what IOPS restrictions are per user and are there any distributions between all users); </li><li>  processors that support the latest instructions, provided that they are adequately priced (since performance may differ by several times, only due to the support of the instructions, the <a href="https://habr.com/company/ua-hosting/blog/419777/">case is described in this article</a> , where the cores of the old processor, at the same frequency, performed the operation 8 times slower, but the price for them was in recalculation higher than for new cores), let me insert myself a quote: </li></ul><br><blockquote>  Different CPUs have support for different instructions and not only the number of cores and threads is important.  Therefore, the price should be calculated not on the flow, but not on the processing speed of your operation, which will depend very much on the CPU and on how effectively floating point (comma) operations are processed. <br><br>  For example, the conversion efficiency of the outdated 2xIntel Xeon E5620 2.40GHz, which was released 9 years ago, is 8 times worse than on a new and modern 2 x Intel Dodeca-Core Xeon E5-2650 v4, that is, if you count according to your scheme: <br><br>  1. CPU Model: 2 x Intel Dodeca-Core Xeon E5-2650 v4 2,20 GHz <br>  2. GHz Min - GHz Max: 2.20 GHz / 2.90 GHz <br>  3. Cores - Threads: 24/48 <br>  4. Price / number of flows: 211/48 = 4,396 EURO <br>  5. Price per month: 249 USD / 211 EURO <br><br>  However, if you add an efficiency factor that you have forgotten about, the results will be different. <br><br>  For example, <a href="https://browser.geekbench.com/v4/cpu/8964442">this is the result of ONE E5-2650 v4 processor</a> (not two, but one), and this is the <a href="https://browser.geekbench.com/v4/cpu/8879757">result of two outdated E5620 processors</a> . <br><br>  We are interested in Floating Point for your case: <br><br>  Floating Point Score <b>10451</b> - for <b>two</b> processors E5620. <br>  Floating Point Score <b>38103</b> - for <b>ONE</b> processor E5-2650 v4, we have two of them, because the difference in performance will reach 8 times. <br><br>  And this is even without taking into account all the additional instructions that are important for the conversion and rendering in particular. <br><br>  That is, adding a coefficient, we find that for E5-2650 v4, you need to divide the price by 8, if you compare it with the old E5620, where you were led by the price, and not by the corresponding price / performance for the task. <br><br>  And we get that: <br><br>  1. CPU Model: 2 x Intel Dodeca-Core Xeon E5-2650 v4 2,20 GHz <br>  2. GHz Min - GHz Max: 2.20 GHz / 2.90 GHz <br>  3. Cores - Threads: 24/48 <br>  4. Price / number of flows: 211/48 = 4,396 EURO / 8 = 0.549 EURO <br>  5. Price per month: 249 USD / 211 EURO divided by 8 and we get 31.12 USD / 26.37 EURO <br><br>  <b>0.549 EURO</b> per stream is in comparison, against the outdated E5620, where the price was 2.62 EURO.  , ,    249 ,    5     42 ! <br><br>           . <br></blockquote><br> ,    !     . ,  ,        .
