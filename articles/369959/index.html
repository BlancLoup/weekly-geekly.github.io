They are already on the market in a very wide range for every taste, color and wallet.  And among all this diversity there is one 3D-pen, which stands out for its characteristics and capabilities.  This pen is called CreoPop and the word ‚ÄúCreo‚Äù in the title is not casual.  Of course, we are not talking about creosy refrigeration, it‚Äôs just a marketing ploy.  But there are no ceramic nozzles heated to 200 degrees either.  The handle is completely safe and in addition does not require external power and does not have any wires.  Interested?  Then welcome under cat. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/86c/896/ef6/86c896ef69de48818ad28d266208144f.jpg"><br><br>  Externally, the packaging looks very elegant, the developers have paid attention to the most minor details.  This is already noticeable when you take the CreoPop box in your hand. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/9ed/57e/ea1/9ed57eea17284201ba1a3ebd8758f83a.jpg">

      There is a selective UV varnishing, as well as various design elements, such as a small silk label. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/355/d35/860/355d35860c5842b68f9b85f524edde83.jpg"><br><br>  The valve of the box lid is fixed with magnets, and the contents of the box are covered with a transparent plastic door with a protective sticker to ensure the integrity of the contents prior to purchase. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e91/5ba/50e/e915ba50ee824e6293360d62e31cba68.jpg"><br><br>  By the way, developers come from Tomsk.  This is a fairly young startup that has developed this product and managed to bring it to the international market.  The CreoPop pen was launched on the Indiegogo crowdfunding platform, which even has a special sticker on the package.  To launch this product on a foreign site, it was necessary to create a company in the same place abroad, so a company appeared in Singapore that managed to attract investments from a large business angel and even the Singapore government. <br><br>  Now the CreoPop pen is sold all over the world, and its main sales fall to US retail in the form of large chain stores.  And despite the production of components and assembly in China, the main element of this pen is its ink - a light-curing resin, which is produced only in Russia and from here is supplied to China for the final assembly.  This allows you to avoid the appearance of cheap Chinese copies, since even copying the components, in fact everything is quite simple in the pen, you can not use cheap substitutes for the main element of the pen - resin. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/714/13b/7a3/71413b7a37834cd2935a31fd7a58c85d.jpg"><br><br>  So, open the package by cutting the protective sticker. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ce9/b8b/363/ce9b8b363c83466e97f640e4e0f15e57.jpg"><br><br>  Inside we have the Russified instruction from the Dadget, the pen itself and the ink set of three standard inks in vacuum-packed. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/dcf/57a/6f6/dcf57a6f6b5647cda480461ad72a9d2f.jpg"><br><br>  Everything is very high quality, even on the packaging of cartridges the logo is embossed with foiling. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c1c/34d/16a/c1c34d16a6ba428f874d8f4b1fd27c49.jpg"><br><br>  We remove the top layer of packaging and we see an English-language instruction under it, and under it a drawing mat, some other instruction and a charging cord. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/0c9/ceb/a35/0c9ceba3553a429d8ac45311aa83531e.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c72/d84/d71/c72d84d71c6d44f5b6be410627ff13f1.jpg"><br><br>  There is no charging itself, it has become fashionable now, don‚Äôt put charging with USB output, it seems to me that this is the right decision since the amount of charge at home already exceeds a critical one and there‚Äôs absolutely no sense at all, I would have removed it to the far box anyway. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/868/625/c5d/868625c5db534cde9bc56406c7958b4c.jpg"><br><br>  A cord is the most common, belonging to a CreoPop handle, except perhaps a purple tag.  In general, this color is apparently loved by the authors of CreoPop, since everything is decorated with elements of purple.  Well, except that the handle itself does not have this color. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f40/ab7/46d/f40ab746d26d44c68d1c73cac611db10.jpg"><br><br>  A few words about the pen.  In appearance, it looks massive, but it lies loose in her hand, its weight is not very large. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/cf3/60e/b92/cf360eb922d44b30854a275f42e8e9a9.jpg"><br><br>  Weight without a cartridge is only 77 grams, the cartridge weighs another 22. Total less than 100 grams, much lighter than a modern smartphone, the children's hand will not get tired. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/9d3/a61/efc/9d3a61efcbca48d4b152cb2031008042.jpg"><br><br>  In order to put the cartridge inside, just turn the two halves of the handle.  The mechanism resembles a lens change on the camera, there are also contacts there, and even the sound when opening the knob is similar. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ee9/518/df3/ee9518df3eb645909483b1e2afbfb5c7.jpg"><br><br>  In the package with cartridges, in addition to the containers themselves, there are also replaceable tips for the handle.  The tips of rubber, hardened resin particles are easily removed from them and the tip will never be clogged. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/763/351/c8f/763351c8feee41ba8621a39b73dcd4ef.jpg"><br><br>  Replaceable tips I had 5 pieces.  Two standard, two with a thick spout and one wide flat for painting large surfaces. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/1eb/ff9/ce5/1ebff9ce56854bfab894c2c9a4df47ff.jpg"><br><br>  The pen already has a pre-charged battery, but it‚Äôs better to charge it to 100%. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a6a/bb9/9f6/a6abb99f6ed44c2b8c13948edf804c4a.jpg"><br><br>  When charging at the end of the pen, the red LED is on, when the charge reaches 100%, it simply goes out. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/967/d25/8bd/967d258bd89249fd8ff0600045806fb5.jpg"><br><br>  After about 30-40 minutes the pen was fully charged and I proceeded to the tests. <br>  I performed the very first steps on a special mat, tried different modes and speeds.  There are 5 speeds, they are regulated by pressing the button with the clock, while the selected mode is confirmed by the indication of five LEDs. <br><br>  To draw, you need to press the button near the bottom.  If you press once, the ink begins to be squeezed out of the nozzle at a selected speed, and three UV LEDs located in the same place on the end light up.  After you have drawn something, it is better to light this area again, for this you need to double-click on the same button as in the drawing.  Then just turn on the flash mode. <br><br>  Here I want to scold CreoPop for excessive adherence to design.  The fact is that the CreoPop mat is purple and glossy.  The illumination with LEDs gives a very strong reflection on such a rug and it is unpleasant for the eyes, moreover, since there are three LEDs, the objects are obtained with three shadows close to each other and the object seems to be blurred.  Best of all, for drawing, use matte yellow or brown color.  In general, I quickly removed the complete mat to the side and began to try more interesting options. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/7dc/72b/e07/7dc72be079054ad68f996b221f4716dd.jpg"><br><br>  One of the main advantages of this handle is the absence of heat.  Rather, the ink itself is slightly heated during crystallization, but this is far from 200 degrees when working with ordinary plastic. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/42e/383/33f/42e38333f24b4d629e2fa6c992e22366.jpg"><br><br>  So, for starters, I decided to draw a volume pen holder.  He painted the base and then added vertically standing sticks to the base. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f08/752/20b/f0875220bb394e4da02ca31770126ab6.jpg"><br><br>  Then I also connected them in the air.  I didn‚Äôt sing a couple of chopsticks to light them up properly and they were bent down, but it doesn‚Äôt matter, we‚Äôre just learning and adjusting ... <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/9aa/48d/338/9aa48d3389e54ae1831ec907fac712f4.jpg"><br><br>  After 20 minutes, the stand was ready. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/8b4/53d/de5/8b453dde52744f5a99ad7db1336f108b.jpg"><br><br>  It is fully functional.  Even the thickness in one bar of a thin nozzle holds 3 pens.  Although the resin is certainly not as durable as ordinary plastic from a thermal 3D-pen.  In some ways it may be a minus, but pens are usually used for decorative purposes.  In addition, if you still need something more durable, just use a tip with a wide hole and paint in several layers. <br><br>  And now a more interesting experiment, I spied on it on the official CreoPop channel.  Since the pen cures the ink with light, it can draw directly on the glass of the tablet, circling the pictures. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/eab/6d8/65d/eab6d865d6524071a494ca86cf4ee7cb.jpg"><br><br>  I chose a picture of a smurf for coloring. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/2cf/543/e51/2cf543e513fc4648b1678c9138377d5a.jpg"><br><br>  It is much more comfortable to draw, to get around the lines with confidence, the illumination with LEDs does not interfere very much, you can choose the angle at which the reflection will not get into your eyes. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/41b/a1f/827/41ba1f827cb94807847e0fc0c10324e6.jpg"><br><br>  After a few minutes, the contour was ready.  Shine it better for better curing. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/499/dde/1e6/499dde1e6ec84ffca8d722224e3672ef.jpg"><br><br>  Since there is no black ink, I‚Äôve applied a red over the blue outline.  Cartridges can be changed at any time, there are no problems with changing the bar like a heated pen.  Just opened, took out the old one and put in a new one.  You can continue to draw. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f09/e60/539/f09e60539503405d9f5d3adee7dad573.jpg"><br><br>  Voila, smurf ready.  :) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/70a/ab2/da2/70aab2da2b18401a9494fe82a62e1631.jpg"><br><br>  He easily withdrew from the screen of the tablet without leaving a trace.  By the way ... If you can draw directly on the glass with this pen, why not try painting on window glass? <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/69a/692/688/69a692688d3f49b7bb62c3fc90845688.jpg"><br><br>  In childhood, many painted toothpaste snowflakes on the windows for the new year?  Now it can be done more technologically with the help of a 3D pen, also in different colors.  A translucent colored resin only contributes to this.  The result is great :) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/1e1/9d3/b8a/1e19d3b8adfb494b8ca5e636a1a845ee.jpg"><br><br>  By the way, in the assortment of ink CreoPop has glowing in the dark, I think this is the best use for such ink - painted Christmas motifs on the glass with your own hands. <br><br>  So, in the end. <br><br>  Of the benefits: <br><br>  - Comparing with the usual 3D pen, CreoPop has a great advantage in that it does not contain heating elements. <br>  - It has no wires interfering with drawing. <br>  - There is also no protruding plastic behind the handle that can be confused with the wires and does not facilitate the drawing. <br>  - A wide range of ink and more interesting drawing scenarios (directly on the tablet, window glass or leather). <br><br>  Of the minuses, perhaps not so many points: <br><br>  - The price is not from the budget segment and not everyone will do. <br>  - Branded consumables only one company. <br><br>  I would also like to note that in spite of the fact that the manufacturer claims about the safety of UV radiation with a pen for the eyes, a long time observing the reflected spot of the ultraviolet still causes discomfort.  It seems to me that the glasses are yellow or at least a beige mat for this pen will not be very redundant, well, or draw intermittently and protect your eyes :) <br><br>  In general, the device is interesting.  It looks very presentable and has original functionality.  The CreoPop 3D pen will be a great gift for Christmas or New Year, and you can buy it at a 10% discount on the <a href="https://dadget.ru/katalog/roditelyam/3d-ruchka-creopop/%3Futm_referrer%3Dgeektimes.ru%26utm_source%3Dgeektimes.ru%26utm_medium%3Darticle%26utm_term%3D3d-ruchka-creopop%26utm_content%3D3d-ruchka-creopop%26utm_campaign%3D3d-ruchka-creopop_391">GEEKT-CRE</a> promotional code for 14 days from the date of the review. <br><br>  <b>I was asked to post information for authors:</b> <br><br>  The company "Dadzhet" is interested in publishing independent objective reviews of dadzhetov in various kinds of media.
