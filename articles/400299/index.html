At the same time, despite the political events of the outgoing year, including Brexit, 2017 will be the year of integration of existing technologies.  We asked DataArt industrial practices leaders what trends they expect to see next year in finance, tourism, healthcare, telecommunications, and media. <br><br><h2>  General trends </h2>

      <b>Integration instead of creating a new one</b> <br><br>  In 2017, technology corporations that will press the cool guys from Silicon Valley will be a real engine of progress.  The focus will be the integration of existing technologies that have yet to learn how to apply to solve our real problems with you. <br><br>  <b>IoT and Big Data IoT become big business</b> <br><br>  In 2017, Big Data and the ‚ÄúInternet of Things‚Äù will be transformed from buzzwords into common tools and become part of everyday life at work and at home.  Marketing departments will find their Holy Grail in Iot and Big Data. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h2>  Industry Trends </h2><br>  <b>Financial services and capital markets</b> <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ <b>Cybersecurity and data protection</b> will be a major concern, including at board level.  Financial organizations understand that the inability to protect information about their customers is the main source of reputational risks, not to mention the need to comply with the requirements of regulators.  Organizations will invest heavily in addressing vulnerabilities, debugging processes, and improving the culture of handling information.  As a result, <b>Data management</b> will come out on top in all possible forms. <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ Immediate <b>digitalization of</b> customer service will be a matter of survival for financial sector companies.  Thanks to e-commerce and fintech, user expectations for UX have already skyrocketed.  At the same time, they will continue to create more and more alternatives to traditional financial services. <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ <b>Automation of business processes (BPM)</b> , including using machine learning systems, will be the main source of competitive advantages and increased productivity.  The financial industry still lags behind many others in terms of real-world automation, but the process will continue. <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ <b>The use of cloud technologies</b> will become a necessary element of the infrastructure of financial organizations.  Due to it, many problems common to Legacy can be resolved, in addition, it allows to minimize operational risks as much as possible.  Those who ignore cloud computing will simply stop testing. <br><br>  <b>Travels</b> <br><br>  The return of the love of agencies and hotel chains, artificial intelligence and remote concierge services will seriously change the travel industry. <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ Hotels and <b>online travel agencies</b> will experience a new outburst of feelings for each other.  Despite major acquisitions made by a number of hotel chains, they, like the online agencies remaining in the market, will experience strong pressure from new players, including Google, Airbnb and Facebook.  As a result, long-time rivals make up in the face of new common rivals. <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ <b>Artificial intelligence is</b> just beginning its journey in the tourism industry.  In 2017, major players will continue to buy small startups, but the real dividends from smart bots will still have to wait.  The development of AI requires time, data and knowledge that still need to be saved in the process.  Therefore, perhaps the first to benefit from projects using artificial intelligence here will be able to extract not those who first begin to develop them. <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ <b>Travel consultants</b> , armed with connections and invaluable knowledge, will continue to use high technology, increasing the availability of their services.  This will make working with travel agents a real pleasure.  But only under the condition of high professionalism of the latter. <br><br>  <b>Telecommunications</b> <br><br>  Cloud technologies, software-configured networks (SDN) and 5G will lead to a significant transformation of the service delivery process. <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ Continue the spread of innovative <b>over-the-top</b> mobile apps designed for business and personal communication.  This is facilitated by WebRTC, a technology that allows you to share information in real time using cloud contact centers using a variety of devices. <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ <b>Virtualization of network functions</b> and <b>software-configured networks</b> will trigger changes in the telecommunications business as a whole.  They will enable faster release and support of new services, giving users a wider choice of content and applications. <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ In 2017, <b>5G</b> will mature, the industry will reach a new level of opportunities, which will lead to the emergence of whole new classes of services.  There will be significant changes in the development of mobile devices.  IoT in telecom will grow significantly, and the spread of <b>Mobile Edge Computing (MEC)</b> will continue. <br><br>  <b>Health care</b> <br><br>  The development of the industry will be greatly affected by the new administration of the United States, especially given the fact that the President-elect and the Republican Congress intend to revise or cancel Obamacare. <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ New rules will lead to the upgrading of existing systems, but they can also give creators of health technology the opportunity to introduce innovations where it was not previously intended. <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ 2017 will be the year of medical <b>startups</b> .  New breakthrough technologies will push the industry forward - in the future, virtual and augmented reality technology in healthcare will become so familiar that the line between real and virtual will be blurred. <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ In 2017, real <b>DIY</b> projects will start to appear in healthcare, unregulated innovations will reach a new level.  Formal processes in medicine take too much time and money, and the possible risks here are always regarded as extremely high.  At the same time, people are developing their own projects of value, which is not confirmed by clinical studies in the current sense.  Whether this trend will lead us to future progress in healthcare, and whether the path is too slippery and dangerous, only time will tell. <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ In the first place will be <b>integration</b> .  Systems such as electronic medical cards ( <b>EHR</b> ) are difficult to interoperate with.  But the requirement of ‚Äúsubstantial use‚Äù (Meaningful Use) of electronic medical cards, which implies patient access to information about their own health through the API, will enable many relatively small companies to create new services around the open API of large EHR platforms.  As a result, they will be able to benefit all parties involved in the industry. <br><br>  <b>Iot</b> <br><br>  2017 will be for the Internet of things a year of disintegration and distribution among all other industries.  Technology is changing markets, and business models are adapting to change, forcing companies to be more flexible and more likely to implement the latest solutions. <br><br>  Cloud solutions and machine learning are the obvious answers to the challenges of the transformation process.  This year, there has been an increase in demand for the use of these technologies in the field of data collection and management, optimization, automation and reduction of operating costs, preventive maintenance, analytics and forecasting. <br><br>  <b>Media and entertainment</b> <br><br>  As in other areas, in the global music industry more attention will be paid to blockchain technology.  Along with this, the increase in personalization of services will continue, and the technologies of virtual and augmented reality will be more widely used.  Algorithmic purchase of advertising will increasingly cover the market, and the struggle between the various streaming platforms will continue. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/400299/">https://habr.com/ru/post/400299/</a></p>
