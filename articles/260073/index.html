Moreover, such companies continue to develop the IT infrastructure, and some even plan to create new data centers. <br><br>  For example, BitFury, one of the largest miners in the world, bought a plot of land in Georgia, where it is planned to build a giant data center, where the corresponding equipment will be located.  Another company, KnCMiner, another heavyweight in the world of bitcoin mining, acquired a piece of land in Sweden, with a similar goal.  Both companies produce cryptocurrency mining equipment and plan to build their own data centers for the same purpose. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h3>  Bitfury </h3>

The object will be very large, this can be judged by the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe purchased land in Georgia: 185,000 m2.  At the same time, not only the data center, but also the Georgian Technological Park will be located here. <br><br>  It is worth recalling that BitFury is one of the largest producers of ASIC-iron for mining bitcoins.  This is an international organization that has offices in the United States and Europe, as well as its own data centers in Georgia and Iceland.  According to management, Georgia was chosen because of the "ease of doing business" and inexpensive land. <br><br>  The data center will house equipment based on 28-nm and 16-nm chips, their production will soon be launched.  By the way, KnCMiner has already released 16-nm chips to the market. <br><br>  And yes, in the data center will be used immersion cooling equipment.  The company BitFury bought Allied Control, this organization has already been written on Habr√© earlier.  Allied Contor promises PUE = 1.01. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/oZavKweMrP4%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=25657,15700021,15700186,15700191,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhhlpdaump2vKQbQOEUVZkuRL7lycQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  And not only promises.  Allied Control specialists built a small data center in Hong Kong, where a special cooling method was used, thanks to which PUE was brought to a value of 1.01. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c2d/44d/754/c2d44d7546cb49a6a8d9d6bb168692e4.jpeg"><br><br>  The advantage of such a cooling system is the practical absence of noise - in the data center is quieter than in the library.  The maximum power that falls on the rack, when using such a cooling system, can be up to 225 kW. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/855/ad5/72f/855ad572f76f4f3a97e8c7912f5297a6.jpeg" width="750"><br>  <i>This is how the blades look, here they are up to 92 in each unit.</i> <br><br>  ‚ÄúThis acquisition will allow us to significantly increase the energy efficiency of our data centers and accelerate the deployment of our new equipment.  As a result, we hope to reduce overall capital costs.  In addition, the experience of the Allied Control team provides an opportunity to enter new markets, such as HPC.  The use of immersion cooling technology will provide BitFury with flexibility in choosing locations for new data centers, ‚Äùcommented the purchase of Allied Control, Valery Vavilov, CEO of BitFury. <br><br><h3>  Kncminer </h3><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/0af/c8b/f4e/0afc8bf4e166c077d8bed96a714a31aa.jpg" width="750"><br><br>  This company already has several data centers in Sweden, and now several more may appear.  In any case, the management hopes to put the first such data center into operation in September of this year.  This will be a two-story facility in Boden, Sweden. <br><br>  It is worth noting that this company is going <a href="http://thenodepole.com/2015/06/04/kncminer-to-build-new-20mw-greenfield-datacenter-in-the-node-pole/">to build a 20 MW data center</a> that will use energy from renewable sources - basically, the DC will consume energy from a nearby hydroelectric station. <br><br>  Boden is located near the Arctic Circle, which allows for efficient cooling of equipment.  The total area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe new data center will be 1700 Mts.  Investors working with ‚Äúgreen‚Äù energy are quite active in this region, and the company hopes to attract additional funds to its project. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c7f/585/0de/c7f5850de24a42e86df1bec8bf783c2a.jpg"><br><br>  By the way, the company calls its new <a href="http://www.coindesk.com/kncminer-deploys-next-generation-16nm-bitcoin-asic/">16 nm chips</a> ‚Äúrevolutionary‚Äù, claiming that these chips will be able to change the rules of the game in the bitcoin mining market.  So, Solar is 6 times more productive than the previous 28 nm chips, which were previously manufactured by the company.  And in the new data center it will be used exactly such chips. <br><br>  Data centers, the task of which is bitcoin mining, are quite different from the standard data center.  First of all, less uptime.  Indeed, in this area of ‚Äã‚Äãuptime, although important, but not so much as in the "ordinary" DC.  And cryptocurrency mining companies are not willing to pay for ultra-reliable data centers.  Most of these DCs are built by the company itself. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/260073/">https://habr.com/ru/post/260073/</a></p>
