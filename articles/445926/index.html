      In January 2019, the US Department of Defense Intelligence Agency released a list of <a href="https://fas.org/irp/dia/aatip-list.pdf">38</a> research <a href="https://fas.org/irp/dia/aatip-list.pdf">topics</a> that were part of this program.  This happened at the request of Stephen Aftergood, director of the Government Secrets Tracking Project of the Federation of American Scientists, who took advantage <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2597%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BA%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BD_%25D0%25BE_%25D1%2581%25D0%25B2%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B1%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B5_%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BD%25D1%2584%25D0%25BE%25D1%2580%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B0%25D1%2586%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B8_(%25D0%25A1%25D0%25A8%25D0%2590)">of the Freedom of Information Act</a> . <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The list contains the most complete Pentagon projects related to UFOs and the study of " <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/head-of-pentagons-secret-ufo-office-sought-to-make-evidence-public/2017/12/16/90bcb7cc-e2b2-11e7-8679-a9728984779c_story.html%3Futm_term%3D.9d7e40e5cfef">anomalous aviation threats</a> ."  After the request of the Aftergud, a document marked “For Official Use Only” was sent to the US Congress in January 2018. <br><br><img src="https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1547765205852-Screen-Shot-2019-01-17-at-24632-PM.png"><br><br>  One of the topics of study, “traveling wormholes, stargates and negative energy,” was led by Eric Davies of EarthTech International Inc, which <a href="http://earthtech.org/about/">is described</a> as an enterprise that “studies the advanced frontiers of science and engineering” and is interested in space-time theories. quantum vacuum and the search for extraterrestrial civilizations. <br><br>  Another project, “invisibility coverage,” was developed under the direction of the German scientist <a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/~www_pa/news/old_news/archive/ulf.htm">Ulf Leonhart</a> , a professor at the Weizmann Institute of Israel.  Leonhart's research concerns theoretical quantum optics, and in 2006 <a href="https://www.nature.com/news/2006/060522/full/news060522-18.html">Nature magazine quoted</a> his work on the theoretical possibility of creating an “invisible hole in space in which objects can be hidden”. <br><br>  Another project, “Warp Engine, Dark Energy and Manipulations with Extra Dimensions,” refers to theoretical physicist Richard Obousi, director of the non-profit organization Icarus Interstellar, which <a href="http://www.icarusinterstellar.org/team/dr-richard-obousy">claims</a> to “explore technologies that will allow breakthroughs in interstellar travel.”  Gizmodo <a href="https://gizmodo.com/5292471/this-is-how-a-warp-drive-spaceship-looks">wrote</a> in 2009 that Obuzi managed to create a “scientifically accurate project of a warp-ship”, which, hypothetically, can move in space using dark energy. <br><br>  “This list of research works gives us more information than we had about this strange program,” AfterGood wrote in an email.  “Now we have a better idea of ​​what the Intelligence Agency of the US Department of Defense was doing and what it gave out.” <br><br>  Other items look mysterious and foggy, since their essence is described in one line of text.  One mentions "metallic glass" and <a href="https://engineering.jhu.edu/magazine/2003/09/raising-bar-bulk-metallic-glass/">can relate</a> to an experimental type of flexible metal alloy, and the subject of "biomaterials" can repeat biotechnology research with low gravity <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/directorates/esmd/aboutesmd/acquisitions/OBPR-01-126.html">sponsored by NASA</a> . <br><br>  But although the Pentagon’s document is full of hypothetical ideas better suited to science fiction, it says that this program was more than just a UFO hunt. <br><br>  The Ministry of Defense did not recognize the existence of the program openly until it was reported in the newspapers.  She was “ <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/16/us/politics/pentagon-program-ufo-harry-reid.html">mostly</a> financed by Harry Reid’s request,” who was then the leader of the majority in the Senate, and from 2007 to 2012 she spent $ 22 million on it. <br><br>  We do not know exactly how the selection of projects included in the program was made. <br><br>  “I think that any person who reads these headlines will begin to scratch their heads and figure out what the US Department of Defense’s Intelligence Directorate generally thought of,” said Aftergood.  “People start to deal with similar topics when they have more money than ideas about where to put them.” <br><br>  According to the New York Times, most of the program’s budget went to the Nevada-based company Bigelow Aerospace, owned by Reid's old friend and UFO hunter, Robert Bigelow, the hero of the documentary "The <a href="https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/59abbx/hunt-for-the-skinwalker-is-the-first-video-released-from-inside-ufo-wolf-haunted-ranch-robert-bigelow">Hunt for Skinwalker</a> ."  The film tells about <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A0%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BD%25D1%2587%25D0%25BE_%25D0%25A1%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BD%25D1%2583%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580">the Skinwalker ranch</a> , which became famous as one of America’s most paranormal places, which was later bought by entrepreneur and billionaire Bigelow. <br><br>  The first hints of the existence of this program were made by Luis Elizondo, a military intelligence officer who had run this program for seven years.  When he resigned, he <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/head-of-pentagons-secret-ufo-office-sought-to-make-evidence-public/2017/12/16/90bcb7cc-e2b2-11e7-8679-a9728984779c_story.html%3Futm_term%3D.b9fda91d6924">sent a request</a> for the publication of filming meetings with UFOs.  These videos were subsequently published by the New York Times and the Washington Post.  At the time, Reid was trying to increase the secrecy associated with the discoveries made by the program. <br><br>  The agency claims that the "Program for the identification of modern threats to airspace" was closed due to lack of funding, but Elizondo <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/16/us/politics/pentagon-program-ufo-harry-reid.html">says</a> that she continues to study meetings with UFOs. <br><br>  In a brief report by the Pentagon for 2009, the then director of the program <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/16/us/politics/pentagon-program-ufo-harry-reid.html">argued</a> that "what was previously considered science fiction is now a scientific fact." <br><br>  “When I was younger, I loved science fiction,” said Aftergood.  “I like good government today.”  Therefore, I was not particularly pleased. ” </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/445926/">https://habr.com/ru/post/445926/</a></p>
