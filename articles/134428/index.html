  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Free Cheese or Multistage Sales</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  <i>The topic of marketing on Habr√© is covered rather weakly, although many habrovchan have their own sites, and something is sold to them.</i>  <i>Usually, multi-step sales are talked about in the context of infobusiness, which many do not like.</i>  <i>But the tool is useful and works not only for selling trainings on the Internet.</i> <i><br></i> <br>  We often see enticing signs and advertisements promising free services or goods at dumping prices.  For example, videos of various trainings will be given to you free of charge, immediately after registering on the site, dry-cleaning a vehicle at an average city price (St. Petersburg) costs 4,000 rubles only 2,000, and it‚Äôs generally free to determine the level of English in any English school. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/435ccdc8/8bd8e726/9beccec3/ac4b3c6d.jpg"><br><br>  The thought about coupon sites is already getting into my head, but I want to touch on a deeper concept, without an understanding of which, selling goods through coupon sites becomes unprofitable - these are <b>multi-step sales</b> .  If to simplify greatly, then in the first step we give the client something useful for him for a nominal fee or for free at all.  And only after that we begin to sell him our main product. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Everyone knows that making a re-sale is several times easier than attracting a new customer.  Especially if the client had only positive impressions from the first sale.  Even if the first sale is a stool, and the second is a kitchen with appliances.  Multistep sales are built on this.  First we sell what is sold easily, and then what makes a profit. <br>  I have two clients who sell their services in this way.  They do not make secrets from their "chips", therefore, using their example, I can illustrate this approach. <br><br><h4>  English language school </h4><br>  The School has several channels to attract customers and almost all lead to the site.  These are coupon sites, partners, social networks, advertising.  The site is made in such a way that the visitor has a desire to sign up for testing, find out your level of English.  Honestly, it reminds me of a ritual.  In order to come to us you need to sign up for testing.  Side effects are: <br><ul><li>  The record allows you to increase the motivation to visit the school, because a specific time is set at which the client will wait. </li><li>  Contact information is collected, now the client will not be lost.  If he is late, they will call him and ask if everything is all right. </li><li>  Appears statistics on different channels to attract customers.  You can plan your advertising budgets more effectively. </li></ul><br><h5>  2-step scheme </h5><br>  The main function of recording for testing is by no means determining the level of knowledge.  The teacher can determine the level of knowledge in 15 minutes.  But now we are not forcing the client to make a decision on the purchase of a course in front of the monitor screen, but simply bring him to the school premises.  It is much easier to make a decision about learning, being in the right atmosphere - and they created it.  British flag, English words written in chalk on the walls, smiling administrators.  As a result, the level of conversion of visitors into customers reaches 70%.  Attraction scheme: <br><ol><li>  The client passes a free test, for which he visits the office.  You need to impress the atmosphere and level of service. </li><li>  The client enrolls in the course and makes a prepayment. </li></ol><br>  The school is located on Nevsky Prospect, so some people come after seeing the signboard and not visiting the site.  The only difference is that it is not necessary to convince the client to come to the office, he has already arrived.  It is only necessary to answer his questions and test.

    <h5>  3-step scheme </h5><br>  Increasing the number of steps, we provide a smoother transition to the purchase.  If well thought out scheme, at each step will leave only a small percentage of the audience. <br>  Many people from the target audience gladly attend useful seminars and trainings.  Therefore, the school conducts seminars on memory increase, speed reading, mafia games in English (of course at very low prices).  When they offer to teach to memorize 60 foreign words in 1 hour at a memory training, many people have a wow effect, and they come.  It remains to offer to undergo a free test, "once you have come."  At the same time, the scheme of attraction almost does not change: <br><ol><li>  The customer buys a side service. </li><li>  After receiving a side service, he also undergoes free testing. </li><li>  The client enrolls in the course and makes a prepayment. </li></ol><br>  Steps can be added to this scheme, both at the beginning and at the end.  For example, selling a VIP product can be the 4th step and bring substantial income even if only a small percentage of customers will buy it.  But this is a topic for a separate article. <br><br><h4>  Accounting for non-accountants </h4><br>  The elements of the scheme described above are used by many English schools, but I have never seen such an approach anywhere in law firms.  The essence of the business - registration jur.  individuals, accounting services and legal support, both beginners and experienced businessmen.  There is not a word about this on the site, but it generates leads, which are then well converted into customers. <br>  It's very simple - the site does not sell anything at all, its function is to convince the visitor to subscribe to the free newsletter.  And convinces!  Indeed, for the target audience in the ezine collected really useful information.  The differences between individual entrepreneurs and limited liability companies are described in a simple form, there is a calendar for the delivery of financial statements, important features of the design of employees for work and other materials that are useful to have before your eyes when opening a new company.  To do this, just subscribe to the newsletter. <br>  Letters come automatically at a specified interval.  After 5-6 letters, the subscriber no longer doubts the experience and qualifications of the mailing list author (by the way, it was done very well, there is not the slightest desire to unsubscribe).  And then just need to mention that his company registers jur.  persons and accepts on accounting service of everyone.  If we simplify, we get the scheme: <br><br><ol><li>  Sign up for the newsletter. </li><li>  In the newsletter announce the service. </li></ol><br>  And it is really beautiful!  The client orders the service not because we ‚Äúbought it‚Äù to him, but because he believed in the professionalism of the distribution author (the owner of the company), and the CAM wanted to use his services.  Competitors also offer to buy first, and only then check their professionalism. <br><br><h4>  How to sell on coupon sites </h4><br>  Coupon sites are designed for giant discounts.  And if you do not give them, then do not buy coupons.  And to give a big discount, you must either deceive the buyer about the real value of the goods, or work in the negative. <br>  If we have a streamlined multi-step scheme and the conversion is calculated from the first to the last step ... we know that we can take the first step in the negative!  At the same time, we earn the following steps enough to recoup both advertising and an unprofitable first step and make a profit.  And also the loyalty of regular customers.  For some, this is important. <br><br><h5>  For those who sell something online </h5><br>  You may remember that you yourself have already used this technique, or your competitors use it.  But if you think about where else it can be applied, I will be glad.  It is much more pleasant to live in a world where you know in advance that you are buying a good thing or service, and you are not looking for one satisfactory service from a dozen low-quality ones. <br><br>  UPDATE.
