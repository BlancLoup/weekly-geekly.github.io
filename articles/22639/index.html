Thus, users of My World will have the opportunity to use many interesting applications created in different parts of the world. <br><br>  Announced in November 2007, the Open Social project offers a community of independent developers universal application programming interfaces (APIs) for social networks.  Today, popular networks like MySpace, Bebo.com, Engage.com, Friendster, hi5, Hyves, Imeem, LinkedIn, Ning, Oracle, Orkut, Plaxo, Salesforce.com, Six Apart, Tianji, Viadeo and XING have supported the initiative. and many others.

      Recently, Yahoo has announced its joining the Open Social project.  In addition, Yahoo, Google and MySpace have founded the non-profit organization OpenSocial Foundation to further develop and promote this platform throughout the world. <br><br>  Independent analysts are increasingly expressing their opinion about the revolutionary role of Open Social, and that development based on this platform can drastically change people's perception of social networks. <br><br>  In Russia, the users of the project My World@Mail.Ru will be able to assess the scale of these changes.  With the help of various applications created by third-party developers, each member of the social network will be able to give his personal section more uniqueness, attract friends with the help of an individual collection of favorite applications and make hanging out on the project even more fun. <br><br>  For example, a user will be able to invite his friends to rate a collection of books he has read over the past week or songs he has listened to, and then see how much his tastes coincide with the literary or musical preferences of his friends.  Or you can place a geographic map on which friends will be able to mark the corners of the planet they have visited and share their impressions of the sights.  Also, being on your personal page, you can receive messages and other information from other social networks in which the user is registered. <br><br>  We should also single out a class of applications that are not aimed at interacting with other users and are created solely for the convenience of a social network member, like widgets.  For example, it can be the forms for entering the purse of the payment system, a clock, sets of hundreds of emoticons that convey mood, etc., located on its page. <br><br>  Open Social support is not the first step for Mail.Ru in the direction of open source software.  In 2005, the company opened Mail.Ru Agent, an instant messaging data exchange program for independent developers.  As a result, for a relatively short time, the support of this messenger in Jabber, Miranda, mChat was implemented, and a number of alternative clients working on the Mail.Ru Agent‚Äôs network, including the java client (for mobile phones) and Windows Mobile, were developed. client (for smartphones). <br><br>  ‚ÄúWe believe that Open Social opens up tremendous prospects for social networks in terms of user capabilities.  Therefore, it was decided to use this platform in the development of the project Moy Mir@Mail.Ru, says Vladimir Gabrielyan, technical director of Mail.Ru.  ‚ÄúThe support of an open interface will allow developers from Russia to be involved in the process of creating new applications.‚Äù </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/22639/">https://habr.com/ru/post/22639/</a></p>
