      Since this is the first article in the series, let me introduce myself, we are the Generate.club company.  Our main occupation is the creation and launch of various start-ups, our partners, the company <a href="http://yambox.net/">Yambox</a> , is a complete operator, that is, these guys can be entrusted with all the logistic processes of your online store from storage and bundling to delivery to the final recipient, and it‚Äôs easy to manage your business. play economic strategy. <br><br>  We noticed that many of our customers, selling their products, are incurably banal in their techniques, despite the fact that marketing and PR technologies are now essentially an art form, most of the entrepreneurs do not go further than simply dumping their goods are clear the eyes of the client and throw a simple message like "well, we are cheaper than those guys."  It looks like this: come to the theater to watch a play ‚ÄúHamlet‚Äù, the actor lights up the stage and says, ‚ÄúWell, in the end, in short, everyone died,‚Äù you think - ‚Äúwhat the fuck, I paid money for this ticket‚Äù and he to you "Well, but we are cheaper than in the neighboring theater." <br><br>  As a matter of fact, a person doesn‚Äôt need most of the goods he buys, and this isn‚Äôt the kind of discovery, so let's talk about what will help to attract the attention of your client and show him a real idea about extreme marketing. <br><br><h4>  Technique soft capture attention. </h4><br><br>  My comparison of marketing with the theater is not that true, because a person comes to the theater already ready, tuned to the perception of the beautiful, and having paid the money in advance, it would be more accurate to compare it with the presentation that the market trader arranges at the fair to the buyers, praising your product. <br>  Here is your buyer slips on the market square, and to him to the left, then with the right shove various goods.  Barkers shout at whom it is even scary to look, they will grab hold of the sleeve and start to do something, someone offers to test the sour pickled cabbage for freebie, but there is a gloomy two-meter peasant and before him a mountain of Tambov potatoes laid out, here are sectarians with tambourines dancing and sing "earn 100.5 billion in three days without doing anything" <br>  And he goes and thinks ‚Äúyou went to hell with your tambourines, where are the fruits sold here‚Äù. <br>  He comes up to a guy with a strange name ‚ÄúYandex Guglovich‚Äù asks him about fruits and he points to a long row.  In which somewhere in the middle is your modest counter. <br><br>  Presented a picture? <br>  Now imagine that there is no market, no peasant with potatoes, no sectarians, or your counter.  There are only an infinite number of words, numbers and pictures. <br>  Indeed, in essence, the Internet is such a healthy self-recording book, or rather a multitude of books combined in a library, the shelves of which also consist of words and numbers, since the program code is also words and numbers combined in a certain sequence. <br><br>  It turns out that the consciousness of our client moves through words, numbers and pictures, wrapped in words, numbers and pictures that are created from other words, numbers and pictures.  And all these words, numbers and pictures are created by people or machines that people have created in order to somehow exchange images created by imagination. <br>  But, as you probably already understood, the word is first of all what controls the mind ... <br><br>  ORANGE. <br><br>  Did you notice?  I wrote the word "ORANGE".  You read it and your body instantly responded. <br>  Your taste memory has worked.  The distant taste of orange appeared in the mouth, whether you like this taste or not, depending on whether you like oranges.  Then, almost instantly, an image of an orange appeared in your imagination, or rather, more likely it was not even that, something orange appeared in your imagination, perhaps not even clothed in shape, but having the qualities of an orange. <br><br>  Such a generalized orange "Orange". <br><br>  This is what we need, I will not insert a picture here, because if I put a picture here, then you will see a completely certain orange, and your generalized orangeness in your mind will take shape and become like a certain fruit. <br><br>  Wham! <br>  Notice what happened to the orange in your imagination?  He has taken shape.  Now he has lost his ideality and has taken shape.  What happened? <br><br>  Notice I gave you just one word-image, the rest of the flow of words was directed at managing your vision of that image.  In other words, I wrote a simple program code that you thought and executed my script.  At first, I disoriented your mind, forcing you to analyze a complex semantic structure, your logical thinking was distracted and exhausted, and then I soldered your image that I needed that would not exist for more than a second if I did not support it in other words, forcing it to live and will change in your mind. <br>  I‚Äôm not mistaken if I say that some of you wanted to go to the refrigerator and get the ORANGE from there.  Some people did not have oranges in the fridge, which is why I decided to offer it to you right now, so take this ... <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/4fa/da7/d53/4fada7d539f4497db9d47dcbe275237b.png" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/37d/6cd/5bd/37d6cd5bdb3042c59b1b4b156a6fe306.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Did I sell you an orange? <br><br>  Stop the game!  now in the case. <br><br>  The visitor comes to your site from everyday life with work, mortgage, mother-in-law and breaking machine.  He brought it all with him and will chew it like a cow in a meadow until you take this cud from him.  This can be done in several ways, the first one I just tried to show you as I could. <br><br>  I do not remember how this technique is called the clever uncles who invented it, so for convenience we call it ‚Äúsoft attention grab‚Äù.  In fact, I disoriented your mind and directed your thoughts to the object that I needed, then I waited for this image to take root in your brains and form a need, so I wandered around for a long time.  Supporting your attention with stories about the technique of ‚Äúsoft capture‚Äù I constantly mentioned in the text the image I needed.  Notice, I tried not to let your vision adjust and run to the word ‚Äúorange‚Äù without noticing it, so I sometimes used caps and a different font. <br><br>  I think it did not work for everyone, but the experiments I have conducted earlier say that this technique works for more than 70 percent of readers.  Do not throw me with stools, I know that many people call illegal marketing, but my fundamental position is that if you do not sell anything harmful to freedom and health, then it's okay if you play a little with the psychology of your customers.  In any case, every word read or spoken already somehow changes your consciousness, so why don't you buy an orange ÔÅä Besides, we are worse than guys from one well-known cellular operator. <br><br><h4>  Technique hard grab attention </h4><br><br>  This technique is based on the same principle, but differs in that bright visual images are used for splitting attention. <br>  In other words, if in the first case, to take away her chewing gum from a cow, you jump around the cow with a tambourine and whisper heartily into her ears, then in the case of a hard capture you put in front of the cow chewing grass in the meadow, a desert desert landscape with a nuclear explosion in the background and hope that she will spit out the grass in surprise and eat your cacti. <br>  In the case of a hard capture, the splitting effect is almost always triggered by the dissonance of visual content, some logical error, the fact is that when our consciousness sees a mistake, it begins active analytical work, our mind tries to arrange everything on the shelves, systematize, restore the usual order of things.  This activity depletes attention and gives the cunning marketer the opportunity to get into your head. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/9b2/ae9/102/9b2ae9102ad74b3b8e769d1734d9cd64.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Let's analyze the picture.  The discord in this picture is provided by two dancing sharks, this catches our attention and can even be said to be a little disorienting.  Visitor entering the site represents that there will be a girl smiling with a phone in her hands or some man in a business-looking jacket, but not like a non-dancing shark.  Then our attention goes to the phrase "you will not disconnect with us."  Ha, they mock, looking away from this madness is not so easy.  This phrase is the simplest script that gives us the command not to close the tab, not to rewind the site down, to leave attention here on this banner.  Attention, the resource is exhausted and after a couple of seconds we feel the need to switch it to another object of lesser intensity, then we read the title and it easily and without forcing penetrates our cow directly into the mouth.  At the moment, our mind can not resist the information, our attention is tired and will eat the cactus that will be offered to him. <br><br>  It should be noted that both of them cannot be used everywhere. <br>  For example, the second technique works well for drawing attention to new products of your company, the first one may not be used badly in article advertising. <br><br>  This article does not claim to exhaust the topic, of course, there are other less extreme techniques to attract customers, for example, you can simply sell something very necessary and high-quality, then you will not only need these tricks, and maybe even the site will not be needed . <br>  The next article will be about how to properly grow the right idea in the head of the site visitor and how to add value to the product, working correctly with the memories and associative line of your customers, so subscribe. <br><br>  Sincerely, team Yumboks operator <a href="http://yambox.net/">fulfilment</a> which helps to turn your online store into an economic game, and startup studio ‚ÄúGenerate.club‚Äù. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/299574/">https://habr.com/ru/post/299574/</a></p>
