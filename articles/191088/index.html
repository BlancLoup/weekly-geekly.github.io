  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Blog KolibriOS is looking for authors</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  It so happened that, apart from me and <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/clevermouse/" class="user_link">CleverMouse</a> , none of the <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/kolibrios/profile/">members of the KolibriOS project who are present at Habr√©</a> have any free time (desire, ability to underline) to write articles to our blog.  We two, while working on the main job, cannot devote enough time to a blog so that articles appear regularly at least once a week (I remind you that <b>KolibriOS</b> is just a hobby for us, and all work on this operating system is voluntary) . <br><br>  As you may have noticed, there have been no new articles in the blog for more than a month, because for the last month we are both busy at work more than usual.  I even can not finish writing the promised 2 articles about Kickstarter.  And I am very sorry that <s>such a good thing is missing a</s> blog idle. <br><br>  So I decided to try my luck on <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/info/help/posts/">the authors' exchange</a> (this is allowed on Habr√©).  Any user who wants to write articles to the <b>KolibriOS</b> blog can contact me through a personal message on Habr√©, or <a href="http://board.kolibrios.org/">on our forum</a> , or simply write a comment in this topic and offer my candidacy, and then I will contact him myself.  You can write about anything - as long as it is somehow connected with <b>KolibriOS</b> .  Examples of ideas for articles: <br><ul><li>  Project news <b>KolibriOS</b> </li><li>  Interview with any member of the project (requires the consent of this person, of course) </li><li>  Parsing code specific functionality </li><li>  Benchmarks, comparisons with other operating systems </li></ul>  etc.  Themes for the articles are solely for the choice of the authors. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b>What is the payment?</b>  To make my life easier, I decided to take advantage of the prices that smart people have come up with before me - namely, the <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/ppa/faq/">PPA (Authors Promotion Program)</a> payment system: <br><blockquote>  If the post in the profile hub according to the results of voting gains a rating of 50 points, then 1000 rubles will be credited to the user's account.  For each rating unit over those 50 points, the user gets another one ruble.  That is, if the post rating after the end of a vote was 170 points, 1,120 rubles are credited to the user‚Äôs account (1,000 rubles for 50 rating points and 120 rubles for 120 points from above). </blockquote>  Accordingly, for a post with a rating below 50 points, as a rule, remuneration will not be paid (I reserve the right to also pay a reward for posts that have scored less than 50 points, if, in my opinion, the assessment was unfair).  The difference from <b>PPA</b> will be that the posts will go to our corporate blog (you can also specify up to two other hubs corresponding to the topic, but they do not have to be specialized).

      <b>Where does the money come from?</b>  <b>Are you a free project on a voluntary basis?</b>  The money will be out of my pocket.  I live in Israel and work in high-tech, and I can afford to spend a little money every month to support my hobby (which, by the way, I have been doing for the last three years).  Since my money, and not the project, then I have the right to decide what to donate.  Foreshadowing your questions in advance: the money <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/180197/">we collected for our project on Kickstarter</a> is spent exclusively on the goals specified in our campaign (to pay for two students and to purchase rewards for mailings). <br><br>  <b>How to get the earned money?</b>  <b>Do I have to pay taxes?</b>  Since there will be a transfer of money from a private person to a private person, I am ready to discuss the payment method individually with each of the authors, and choose the most convenient for both of us, and I leave the tax payment on your conscience at your place of residence. <br><br>  <b>Are authors required to be from Russia?</b>  No, the author can be from any country where money can be transferred from Israel. <br><br>  <b>How many authors are you looking for?</b>  I am not looking for a certain number of authors - I would like a blog to have one article per week, i.e.  4-5 articles per month (except for the articles that we write and <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/clevermouse/" class="user_link">CleverMouse</a> - they do not count, of course, and will be in the form of a bonus).  Whether these 4-5 articles will be written by one author, or 4-5 different authors, does not matter for me.  If there are more articles than 4-5 per month, they will be published ‚Äúfirst come - first served‚Äù. <br><br>  <b>On whose behalf will the articles be published?</b>  All author articles will be published through our corporate user, with reference to the author at the bottom of the article.  This condition is not discussed, but it allows read-only users to write articles for us too. <br><br>  <b>Does the author retain rights to the article?</b>  Yes, the author of the article retains all rights to it, and can publish it on other sites without restrictions (after the end of voting on this article on Habr√©, ie, 72 hours after publication).  We have the right to Habr√© to hide the article in drafts at its discretion, and correct errors in it. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/191088/">https://habr.com/ru/post/191088/</a></p>
