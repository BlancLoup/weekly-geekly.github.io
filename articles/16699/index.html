This was confirmed by the BBC by Kasparov himself, who on Saturday after the ‚ÄúDissenters' March‚Äù was charged under two articles of the Administrative Code: holding an unauthorized rally and disobeying police requirements. <br><a name="habracut"></a><blockquote>  "The United States is concerned about the aggressive tactics chosen by the Russian administration to fight the protesters yesterday in Moscow," said Gordon Joondro, spokesman for the National Security Council. <br><br>  ‚ÄúWe regret that Garry Kasparov and other opposition leaders were arrested and taken into custody.  We demand that they provide the assistance of lawyers and ensure a fair trial in the court, ‚Äùhe said. </blockquote><br><br><blockquote>  ‚ÄúI went to Palace Square, and the police politely indicated where to go,‚Äù said White to the Interfax news agency.  - There I saw a small group of our activists and approached them.  In turn, the journalists asked me to comment on something, but in fact I did not have time to start making comments, as the police appeared, took me by the arms, by the legs and threw me into a bus, where I am now. ‚Äù </blockquote><br><br><blockquote><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/82a/c65/6bc/82ac656bc9ff2e059517ecb78dbdcb66.jpg" width="203" height="152" alt="Nemtsov‚Äôs detention was calm and smooth" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="right">  ‚ÄúAfter the demonstrators walked about 200 meters, they were suddenly joined by about five people, who threw up a black flag with a hammer and sickle, our correspondent notes.  Then the riot police detained people with a black flag, and then began to pull out of the crowd of activists and demonstrators.  In addition to one of the leaders of the Union of Right Forces, the leader of the St. Petersburg Yabloko Maxim Reznik, the head of the United Civil Front in St. Petersburg Olga Kurnosova and others were detained. <br><br>  Even before his detention, the leader of the Union of Right Forces (SPS) Nikita Belykh told BBCRussian.com that in total 50-60 people were put in police cars.  He also said that the actions of people with the black flag were clearly provocative. <br><br>  "We were warned that such provocations would be.  In the course of the movement, several people threw up a black flag and shouted "On the march!".  Within three seconds, the riot police began to deploy their actions.  That is, there is not the slightest doubt that this is a provocation, "says Belykh. </blockquote><br><br>  And all in this spirit. <br><br>  A few links: <br>  - <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/russian/russia/newsid_7111000/7111553.stm">About events in Moscow</a> <br>  - <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/russian/russia/newsid_7111000/7111724.stm">and in Petersburg</a> <br>  - <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/russian/russia/newsid_7111000/7111553.stm">Kasparov's arrest</a> <br>  - <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/russian/russia/newsid_7112000/7112537.stm">US reaction to the incident and some comments</a> <br><br>  and na-pososhok: <br><blockquote>  The deputy leader of the United Russia faction in the Duma, Valery Ryazansky, speaking on the BBC, said he considered the actions of the police to be justified. </blockquote></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/16699/">https://habr.com/ru/post/16699/</a></p>
