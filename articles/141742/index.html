  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Startup WebcamTelecom. A look at the communications of the future</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Is it possible to noticeably press the world market of expensive telephone communication operators, having slightly changed the way people organize communications on the Internet?  Now it‚Äôs hard to even imagine, in spite of the development of VoIP, the growth in the number of services that allow you to call phones from a browser, make free video calls, etc. <br>  We make our modest contribution and offer to test our vision of the development of human voice communications. <br><br>  Based on the fact that the schemes and principles of building telephone networks are morally outdated, we see a future in which a cloud is replaced by an expensive complex infrastructure and strict regulations that form high prices for telephone services, within which all outgoing and SMS are free.  A computer, tablet, smartphone, TV and other digital devices connected to the Internet will enable a person to use all the individual services of the ‚Äútelephone‚Äù cloud, often without using expensive voice communication channels.  The concepts of long-distance, international communication and roaming in the cloud will lose their meaning, and the simplicity, clarity and familiarity of client applications will allow any user who does not have any knowledge in the field of telecommunications and communications to organize, for example, a virtual PBX or Call Center for their needs. <br><br>  By sending the necessary applications to FIPS (Russian Patent Office), we present to your attention a prototype of the cloud project <a href="http://webcamtelecom.com/">WebcamTelecom</a> , which, through a browser, video-audio-chat communication, is intended to replace telephony usage, preserving the usual concepts, functionality and capabilities of landline and mobile communications, making with new user options. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  Basic principles.  Webcam subscribers. </h4><br>  Each registered user of WebcamTelecom receives a unique nine-digit digital number.  With this number, he can become a Webcam subscriber and receive incoming calls.  Any user who follows the link like <a href="http://webcamtelecom.com/100000001">http://webcamtelecom.com/100000001</a> from any site on the network (or directly), in one click calls the Webcam subscriber with the number 10,000,0001. The user who knows the Webcam subscriber's e-mail address can initiate the call by clicking on the link, specifying the email address of the subscriber instead.

      <br>
      The calling user may, before making the call, formulate the topic of the forthcoming conversation (or ask a question).  This information will be visible to the Webcam subscriber and will help him process the incoming call correctly. <br>  Outgoing calls from users who are not registered on WebcamTelecom (or who have not performed authentication) are admissible, but have functional limitations.  For example, an anonymous user cannot enable live streaming from his webcam during a video conversation. <br><br>  In order to receive calls online, the subscriber needs to be authenticated and located on WebcamTelecom.  Incoming calls during the absence of the Webcam subscriber on the site can be transferred to offline (as an SMS with the specified topic of conversation) for further processing or recorded as missed.  Re-entering the site, the Webcam subscriber will see information on incoming SMS and missed calls, can call back in response (reset the reply SMS), provided that the author of the SMS or missed call is also a Webcam subscriber. <br><br>  Incoming calls can form a queue.  For each incoming online call to a queue, a Webcam subscriber can write a response or refuse to receive a call without going into video conversation mode.  You can only go to video talk with the first caller in the queue.  A written response, a rejection of the conversation, or a video call session ends the call. <br><br><h4>  Virtual office PBX or Webcam-services. </h4><br>  For collective / corporate reception and processing of incoming calls using Webcam-services.  They can be compared with the work of virtual office PBXs and even Call-centers (simultaneous reception of a large number of incoming to a single "multi-channel" number by an arbitrary number of employees of the organization, transfer of calls between employees of the organization, etc.). <br>  Webcam services have text identifiers.  For example, clicking the link <a href="http://webcamtelecom.com/Name">http://webcamtelecom.com/Name</a> initiates a call to the virtual PBX "Name".  Any <b>Webcam operator</b> of the Name Webcam service can accept such a call. <br><br>  <b>The owner / customer of the</b> Webcam service can be a legal entity or an arbitrary community of individuals who have an account in the system. <br>  Any user of WebcamTelecom can independently register an arbitrary number of Customers, create and configure an arbitrary number of Webcam services for them.  Each Webcam service should have one Customer, but each Customer can have an arbitrary number of Webcam services. <br><br>  By entering e-mail addresses (as account identifiers), you can create an individual group of Webcam operators for each Webcam service. <br><br>  From users who tried to call during off-hours or during the absence of Webcam operators in the network, Webcam services also allow you to receive SMS messages.  Any webcam operator for a missed call will be able to call back only a Webcam subscriber or a Webcam operator from whom a call was missed or an SMS arrived. <br><br>  Any registered user of WebcamTelecom can be a Webcam operator of an arbitrary number of Webcam services.  Thus, a Webcam user can receive incoming calls on his digital device at the same time: personal, work, home, related to hobbies, part-time work, social activities of the real or virtual world, etc. <br>  When a Webcam user is working at once in several Webcam services as a Webcam operator, his queue of incoming calls is formed by calls from all the virtual PBXs to which he is currently connected. <br>  With simultaneous work of several Webcam operators of a single Webcam service, each operator sees a single formed service queue and can process incoming calls. <br><br><h4>  Monetization </h4><br>  For Webcam subscribers, all available functionality is provided free of charge.  Webcam-services (virtual office PBX) have advanced functionality and are available for a fee, according to the tariff plans. <br><br>  Tariff plans are developed separately for collective and corporate use. <br>  In case of collective use by individuals, the service can be paid by the user who is part of the management team of the Customer.  At the time of publication, electronic money and the Robokassa payment acceptance system are supported for payment. <br>  The provision of services to legal entities by bank transfer is carried out so far only in the territory of the Russian Federation, with the execution of the necessary documentation, invoicing, etc. <br><br>  All outgoing calls and SMS within WebcamTelecom service are always free.  Roaming, long-distance and international calls within WebcamTelecom are free.  Inbox free only for webcam subscribers. <br>  Tariff plans for Webcam-services are organized on the principle of a monthly fee, without taking into account the number and actual total duration of incoming calls.  Tariffs are formed depending on the mode of operation of the Webcam-service, the maximum number of online operators and the selected maximum duration of a video call. <br>  For Webcam services, there is a trial period, during which you can test WebcamTelecom functionality for free by implementing it on collective / corporate Internet resources. <br><br><h4>  Webcamtelecom may be needed: </h4><br>  To commercial and non-profit organizations to provide online consulting for corporate site visitors in video / audio / chat-conversation format, for use instead of telephone communication, for organizing sales, technical support, etc. <br><br>  Budget organizations that provide services to the public and organizations.  In addition to the telephone "for reference", you can organize a "multi-channel" online help, with automatic distribution of calls to the relevant departments. <br><br>  Authorities and law enforcement agencies are invited to use the Webcam service for implementation in the form of: <br>  - "Online reception."  The assistant is the first to receive incoming calls, part of it forwards to specialists and managers of the organization, according to the subject of the caller's request. <br>  - ‚ÄúHot line‚Äù On a hot topic you can provide advice to a large number of people. <br>  - ‚ÄúHelpline‚Äù when it is required to receive signals from the population about illegal actions or inaction, including receiving anonymous appeals. <br><br>  Public people, active bloggers, forum users, etc.  to quickly receive "live" feedback from fans, opponents, subscribers, followers and even casual users of social networks, (micro) blogs and online forums. <br><br>  Users of social networks for free personal conversations with friends and acquaintances directly in the browser.  To receive calls, just enter your Webcam subscriber number as a link in the contact details and log in to Webcamtelecom. <br><br>  Communities of people in social networks and real life.  You can organize the ability to "call the group."  Any one of the managers, administrators, moderators or even simple members of a social network group will be able to accept an incoming call. <br><br>  The organizers of conferences, seminars, workshops, lectures, etc.  You can temporarily unite with the participants of such events, giving everyone the opportunity to resolve issues before and after the event itself.  For example, a registered participant in a seminar on the basics of investing will be able, without knowing personal data, to contact the moderator in advance and ask them to pay attention at the seminar to aggressive investment strategies.  At the end of the seminar, participants will be able to continue the discussion, communicate with the facilitator and the organizers, having traveled to different cities and countries. <br><br>  In our opinion, the service can be useful to all people and organizations that have high-quality Internet access and are interested in prompt and accessible communications. <br><br><h4>  Some implemented functionality and user options. </h4><br>  1. Widget on the customer's site.  The owner of the Webcam-service can install widgets on the pages of the corporate site that allow visitors to initiate calls to the required divisions of the organization.  Widget settings can be easily customized by the owner of the Webcam service.  The widget's shortcut can be located on the right or left of the browser tab, its color indicates the presence of Webcam operators on the network. <br>  2. Transfer call.  The owner of several virtual PBXs has the ability to transfer calls between Webcam-operators of Webcam-services.  For example, an incoming call to the Webcam-service "Reception" regarding the timing of delivery of goods may first be redirected to the Webcam-service "Accounting", to verify the fact of payment, after being redirected to the Webcam-service "shipping department".  At each stage video-audio chat communications with the caller can be made. <br>  3. Forwarding 8-800-online.  For associative perception of a free call, you can use the redirection service <a href="http://8-800-online.ru/Name">http://8-800-online.ru/Name</a> .  Those who follow this link will be automatically transferred to <a href="http://webcamtelecom.com/Name">http://webcamtelecom.com/Name</a> , the required call is initiated. <br>  4. Mode of operation.  For each Webcam service, you can set up an operation mode that will help service call attempts during the absence of Webcam agents during off-hours, overnight hours, or on weekends. <br>  5. Inbox options.  You can allow / block incoming calls in one click, you can allow / block incoming calls from anonymous (unauthenticated) users.  If a one-click call is forbidden, the calling user must first specify the topic of the upcoming conversation or ask their own question.  Anonymous users enter "captcha" when making a call in one click, if allowed by the subscriber's settings at the same time anonymous calls and calls in one click. <br>  6. Tags.  Implemented the ability to pre-set the parameters of calls: the topic of the upcoming conversation, the individual options for receiving anonymous calls and calls in one click.  Tags have a name and a period of relevance.  An example of use.  The webcam subscriber with the number 100000001 needs to distribute unnecessary kittens to good people, he turns on the ‚ÄúKitty‚Äù tag, sets the text of the conversation topic ‚ÄúAbout the kitten announcement‚Äù.  Then she publishes on the electronic bulletin board the text: ‚ÄúI'll give the kitten in good hands,‚Äù points out ‚Äúcontact the link <a href="http://webcamtelecom.com/100000001/Kitty">http://webcamtelecom.com/100000001/Kitty</a> ‚Äù as contact information.  Clicking on the link initiates in one click an outgoing call to the Webcam subscriber, with the theme of the upcoming conversation ‚ÄúOn a Kitten Ad‚Äù.  The term of relevance will allow you to automatically screen calls through the years after the announcement, when the kittens have long grown in the found good hands. <br><br><h4>  Scheduled prototype revisions </h4><br>  0. The most visible improvements required, of course, high-quality design and decent multilingual interface. <br>  1. The ability to make outgoing calls to non-authenticated users using their social network accounts.  If necessary, linking a user account to personal accounts in social networks to simplify authentication. <br>  2. Contacts.  Each user will be able to enter any contacts into a notebook, and the opportunity will be realized to distinguish between personal and collective services contacts, as well as thematically group contacts (for example, Family, Work, School, University, etc.).  You may need the ‚ÄúFriends‚Äù option to receive personal incoming calls only from friends. <br>  3. Speed ‚Äã‚Äãdialing.  For convenient making of frequently used calls, it is planned to implement a speed dial service, which will allow one-click to call from a personal or business service to the desired subscriber, even located within the virtual PBX of another customer.  That is, to make a call as a system administrator Ivanov I.I.  A firms to the B technical support service of the engineer Petrov P.P. <br>  4. Call back.  A connection attempt, when the called party is temporarily unavailable, can be terminated by checking the need to call back the calling party.  When a called subscriber appears online, he will be able to call back a missed call with one click. <br>  5. Service calls, sms.  A convenient opportunity to see all operators in the zone of the connected services of one customer and make a business call or send SMS.  For example, it is easy to call within one company from the Webcam-service of the ‚ÄúLogistics‚Äù department to the Webcam-service ‚ÄúAccounting‚Äù directly to the necessary specialist. <br>  6. Paid calls.  For the remote provision of paid consulting services, after a free preliminary consultation, it will be possible to conduct an online consultation on a prepaid basis. <br>  7. Widget on the customer's site, unobtrusively appearing and inviting the site visitor to call in one click to the free Webcam operator, depending on the context of the pages viewed. <br>  8. Information panel in the user's browser, which will inform about the presence of incoming calls and the presence of raw SMS without the need to have an open tab Webcamtelecom. <br>  9. Sending files with SMS text to the addressee, possibly an equivalent of MMS. <br>  10. If there is a pronounced need for Webcam subscribers, it is planned to realize a free opportunity to receive incoming calls on the name of your Twitter account.  That is, instead of using the 9-digit number, you can call the Webcam subscriber using the link like <a href="http://webcamtelecom.com/TwiName">http://webcamtelecom.com/@TwiName.</a>  This will allow you to switch to a private mode of communication (SMS or conversation) instead of continuing open conversations in Twitter itself. <br><br>  It should be noted that the listed improvements relate specifically to the prototype and are not the final touches of the project itself. <br><br><h4>  Testing. </h4><br>  Our startup opens access in beta testing mode.  We offer to test the possibilities of the service for personal use, for collective or corporate needs of your daily life, for the communication needs of your friends, partners, customers, customers, etc. <br>  Now we are more presenting a concept in order to assess the potential and perspective of the chosen direction, therefore we apologize in advance for the unprofessional design, possible errors and malfunctions, performance problems and serviceability of the service under loads, communication quality, and functional flaws.  We will be sincerely grateful for the feedback with the constructive indication of the defects found, which we will try to eliminate in an adequate time. <br><br><h4>  Project development. </h4><br><h5>  Team building. </h5><br>  In case of a successful launch, in order to move from a prototype to a fully-functional international cloud service, we will need professional combat comrades who will become part of a single highly motivated team. <br>  Problem solving will be required: design, construction and administration of high-loaded architecture, multilingual support, high-quality modern design, Flash programming, development and provision of reliable audio-video communications schemes, including conferences, preparation of mobile applications, application programming for different operating systems, integration projects with VoIP-networks and services, with mobile and fixed public telecommunication networks. <br>  In addition, the project will require experienced IT international CEOs.  Knowledge and experience are needed in the construction of a global company, the formation and implementation of its development strategy, taking into account the peculiarities of local markets, as well as the qualified services of an international lawyer in IT. <br><br>  The list of criteria for the formation of the team has not yet been made.  It is important that the project ambitions always be higher than the personal ambitions of the candidate, and the applicant himself clearly saw his role in the team being built and could objectively and formally evaluate his possible contribution. <br>  Information on the start of team building, requirements and criteria will be posted on the main page of the Webcamtelecom website. <br><br><h5>  Cooperation </h5><br>  We know a large number of existing and developing related services that provide different technologies for efficient and inexpensive user communications on the Internet with free video-audio conversations or with access to a public communication network.  In view of the fact that our project assumes and can provide any engineering solutions for video-audio-communications with a load, we are ready to discuss schemes of mutually beneficial cooperation with such projects. <br><br><h5>  Cloud sourcing </h5><br>  <i>&lt;Offtopic&gt; No errors.</i>  <i>Well, I do not like the word crowdsourcing (eng. Crowdsourcing, the crowd - "the crowd" and sourcing - "use of resources").</i>  <i>It is proposed to introduce (it seems no one has given such a definition) and use the term Cloudsourcing, at least for IT.</i>  <i>&lt;/ Offtop&gt;</i> <br><br>  Focusing on the basic functionality of the prototype, we do not have time to pay due attention to the ‚Äúdesign‚Äù and invite interested specialists to take part in this. <br>  For example, we propose to implement simple applications that will brighten up the waiting time for a response for the calling user, but will not distract him from the upcoming conversation.  At the moment, we have downloaded several free games for the demonstration, you can play them during dialing or waiting for a call. <br>  It is necessary to take into account the preferences of the most diverse groups of people making outgoing calls, so this is not only about games. <br>  Applications or additional functionality that have passed the expert selection will be available for use on our resource, with a mandatory reference to the developer, at a minimum. <br>  The use of the CloudSoursing scheme is not limited to ‚Äúcall waiting‚Äù applications.  Without imposing our vision of other useful options, we are ready to consider your suggestions. <br><br><h4>  Enterprising on the note. </h4><br>  Some readers of this article who have commercial intuition and an entrepreneurial spirit probably already feel the ways of earning money on our service.  We will publish the most simple directions for commercial activity that do not require unnecessary interaction with the developers of the project Webcamtelecom. <br><br><h5>  1. Cybersquatting. </h5><br>  We are in favor of Webcam-services being owned by owners of similar sites on the Internet and / or owners of registered trademarks, so that the link <a href="http://webcamtelecom.com/brandname">http://webcamtelecom.com/brandname</a> can call the company that owns * .brandname. * Or brand name BrandName. <br>  Customers are allowed to use any valid and not used in our system names for Webcam services, but when identifying a site of the same name on the network or a registered trademark, a small additional fee will be charged to the Customer. <br><br>  You can "stake out" for a beautiful, popular, well-known names, to demonstrate to interested persons and organizations the opportunity to make video calls through the browser, in order to profitably sell them a Webcam-service with an important BrandName for them. <br>  Technically, the algorithm is not complicated.  The user creates an arbitrary Customer service (s).  Ordered webcam service with the required brandname.  As a Webcam operator, you can enter the e-mail addresses of brandname owners.  Even without your participation, the interested party will be able to test the work of the service, assess the need for the acquisition. <br>  As a result of negotiations, you can independently re-register the service to another customer. <br><br>  Thus, open space for the individual activities of cybersquatters.  A small fee for using the brand name should stimulate the promotion of our project, since without payment the brand name is released and any other user can take it.  It‚Äôs not expensive for a trademark owner to pay a small amount for owning a Webcam service of the same name, and it‚Äôs not profitable for a cybersquatter to keep hundreds and thousands of beautiful names for a long time. <br><br><h5>  2. Intermediary services. </h5><br>  For potential users of the Webcamtelecom project, who absolutely do not want to delve into the essence of the service, but are willing to pay for its installation and use, as well as for legal entities registered outside the Russian Federation, you can offer Webcamtelecom services with an arbitrary premium.  Create in the Owners / Customers system, arrange services for them as you like, accept payment from any people and organizations in any currencies and any forms convenient to you.  You need to transfer the amounts in rubles required for the operation of the services to our ruble bank account, monitor the parameters and performance of your clients' Webcam services. <br>  Cloud-based Internet services targeted at small and medium-sized businesses may include call-receiving services in their packages. <br>  For example, a customer of an online store can gladly order the option ‚ÄúReceive calls from store pages‚Äù, and an online store provider can set individual parameters for each ordered virtual PBX. <br><br><h5>  3. Outsourcing. </h5><br>  There are a lot of offline around each of us - organizations that are trying to be present on the Internet, are interested in attracting new consumers around the clock through the network, but they themselves have neither the organizational capacity nor the human resources to organize the work even of their own virtual mini PBX.  Perhaps some will be interested to pay for the services of a third-party company for receiving and primary processing of driving calls on the Internet. <br>  Considering also that Webcam calls coming to the organization‚Äôs website will require prior filtering and redirection to specific specialists, you can offer the ‚ÄúVirtual Secretary‚Äù service. <br><br>  The ability to receive calls addressed to different Webcam services by a single Webcam operator allows one ‚ÄúVirtual Secretary‚Äù to handle the flow of incoming calls from several organizations at once.  It is enough to include the ‚ÄúVirtual Secretary‚Äù e-mail in the Webcam-operators of the required services. <br>  It is easy to assume that the more organizations one ‚ÄúVirtual Secretary‚Äù manages to service, the higher the profitability of such a service. <br><br><h4>  Market and competitors. </h4><br>  Our service claims at once for several segments of the existing market of communication services and on each there are competitors, often more than serious.  In each segment, our startup has differences from competitors in the services offered, has its strengths and weaknesses, advantages and, of course, disadvantages. <br>  1. The largest segment is world telephony.  The best part of this segment is customers provided with high-speed Internet access.  Without physically picking up subscribers from landline and mobile voice operators, some of their communication traffic is expected to be sent to Webcamtelecom.  Our main advantage is free outgoing and SMS. <br> 2.
