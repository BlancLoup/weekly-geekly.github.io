The content management system as a whole is a program that employs numerous libraries licensed under both the GPL and the LGPL (as well as under other GPL-compatible licenses) and therefore licensed under the GPL.

    <h3>  Where can I read more about the license? <br></h3><br>  GNU General Public License: <a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/old-licenses/gpl-2.0.html">www.gnu.org/licenses/old-licenses/gpl-2.0.html</a> <br>  Answers to questions about the GNU GPL licenses (FAQ): <a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/old-licenses/gpl-2.0-faq.html">www.gnu.org/licenses/old-licenses/gpl-2.0-faq.html</a> <br>  GNU Philosophy: <a href="http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/">www.gnu.org/philosophy</a> <br><br><h3>  What is the definition of open / free software? <br></h3><br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source</a> <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_software">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_software</a> <br><br><h3>  What does ‚Äúvoluntary consent‚Äù mean? <br></h3><br>  We want all elements to be aligned with our license, which will strengthen our ability to protect and safeguard Joomla!  We have no plans, no funds to go after everyone who violates our license.  We ask the community to voluntarily comply with the GPL. <br><br><h3>  What is the difference between ‚Äúcommercial‚Äù and ‚Äúproprietary‚Äù? <br></h3><br>  Commercial software means that there is a certain commercial activity around such software.  This may be a business for its development and collection of money for distribution, support, documentation, customization, etc.  Commercial software does not always mean closed source software, and closed source software does not always mean commercial software.  Software with closed source code means that you can not copy, modify or distribute such software. <br><br>  See: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proprietary_software">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proprietary_software</a> <br><br><h3>  Does a license allow anyone to sell a copy of Joomla !? <br></h3><br>  Yes.  The GNU GPL preamble says: ‚ÄúWhen we talk about free software, we mean freedom, not value.  Our Standard Public Licenses are designed to be convinced that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish), that you received the source code, or you can get it, if you wish that you can change the software or use parts of it in new free software, and that you realize that you can do all of the above. ‚Äù <br><br>  See also: <a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/old-licenses/gpl-2.0-faq.html">www.gnu.org/licenses/old-licenses/gpl-2.0-faq.html#DoesTheGPLAllowMoney</a> <br><br><h3>  Can I remove the Joomla! Copyright notice  in the footer (and other related questions)? <br></h3><br>  Yes, you can remove the Joomla! Copyright notices.  from any part of the output that is generated by the Joomla!  You cannot remove such information from the source code. <br><br><h3>  Can I remove the Joomla! Copyright notice?  in the meta-information on Joomla !? <br></h3><br>  Yes, you can remove copyright notices from any part of the output that is generated by the Joomla! Software.  You cannot remove such information from the source code. <br><br><h3>  What should I do if I find a possible violation of the GPL license? <br></h3><br>  You must report the possible violation to the appropriate owners.  If you believe that someone is violating the provisions of the GPL license for those who are developing Joomla!, Please report the violation to our <a href="https://tm.joomla.org/contact">Trademark Contact Center</a> using the appropriate violation ticket. <br><br><h2>  Extensions <br></h2><br><h3>  Does a license allow anyone to sell an extension? <br></h3><br>  Yes.  The GNU GPL preamble says: ‚ÄúWhen we talk about free software, we mean freedom, not value.  Our Standard Public Licenses are designed to be convinced that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish), that you received the source code, or you can get it, if you wish that you can change the software or use parts of it in new free software, and that you realize that you can do all of the above. ‚Äù <br><br>  See also: <a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/old-licenses/gpl-2.0-faq.html">www.gnu.org/licenses/old-licenses/gpl-2.0-faq.html#DoesTheGPLAllowMoney</a> <br><br><h3>  Does the license allow anyone to encrypt the extension? <br></h3><br>  Technically, yes, but the distributor should provide access to the source code in its full and unencrypted form, including it in the package or by making it available for download.  The distributor is obliged to provide access "for a fee, no more than the cost of physically providing the source code." <br><br><h3>  Can I publish an extension not under the GPL license? <br></h3><br>  In our opinion, most extensions are derivative works in relation to Joomla!  and therefore must be licensed under the terms of the GNU GPL license.  It is assumed that the extension can work with Joolma!  and not to be a derivative work in accordance with copyright law, but this is determined in each specific case.  If you believe that your extension is not a derivative work, we strongly recommend that you get professional legal advice. <br><br><h3>  What is the difference between processing templates from processing components, modules and plug-ins? <br></h3><br>  In our opinion, templates are composite packages that contain both code and other objects as elements.  We believe that the code included in the template must be licensed under the GNU GPL, because it is a derivative work.  At the same time, other objects are simply data managed by the program, and can be licensed under any conditions that the author wishes.  Other objects include items such as images, videos, animations, css and formatting markup. <br><br>  For your attention: <a href="http://extensions.joomla.org/support/knowledgebase/item/the-gpl-and-the-jed">The GPL &amp; The JED</a> material on special use cases. <br><br><h3>  What is the difference between a bundle with another package and an extension? <br></h3><br>  Bundle links Joomla!  with an external application so that they can communicate and interact with each other.  From the side of Joomla!  A bundle is a kind of component, module or plugin, so you must comply with the requirements of the GPL, if it is not an independent object (and some bundles are really separate objects). <br><br>  If the external application is a separate object in relation to Joomla!  in the understanding of copyright, it may be licensed under any conditions on which its copyright holder wishes. <br><br><h3>  Should the CSS code in my template be licensed under the GPL? <br></h3><br>  No, unless it is based on an object that is licensed under the GNU GPL.  See <a href="http://extensions.joomla.org/support/knowledgebase/item/the-gpl-and-the-jed">GPL &amp; JED</a> (special cases). <br><br><h3>  Should the javascript included in the templates and extensions be licensed under the GPL? <br></h3><br>  No, unless it is based on an object that is licensed under the GNU GPL.  See <a href="http://extensions.joomla.org/support/knowledgebase/item/the-gpl-and-the-jed">GPL &amp; JED</a> (special cases). <br><br><h3>  If I include the module in the template, should it be licensed under the GPL? <br></h3><br>  In general, yes.  See <a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-faq.html">www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-faq.html#GPLModuleLicense</a> <br><br><h3>  I purchased a copy of an extension that violates the Joomla! License.  Can I distribute it under the GPL? <br></h3><br>  Not.  You must report the violation to the appropriate owners. <br><br><h3>  Can I offer my own service with my own closed source extensions? <br></h3><br>  Yes.  The GNU GPL license does not apply unless you distribute your own extensions to third parties.  If you decide to distribute your extensions, they must be licensed under the GNU GPL. <br><br><h3>  Can I publish an extension under a GPL-compatible license? <br></h3><br>  Joomla!  or an extension for Joomla!  may include a block bundle that is licensed under a compatible license, because the block bundle can be successfully licensed under the terms of the GPL for the purposes of the application (of course, without changing the license for other applications using the same library).  This is due to the fact that such licenses are less restrictive, and the Joomla!  Adds GPL restrictions to any use of such libraries with the Joomla!  As the FSF explains on its website: <br><blockquote>  All versions of the GNU GPL license permit such combinations privately;  they also allow distribution of such combinations provided under a license of the same version of the GPL.  Another license is compatible with the GPL if it allows the same. <br></blockquote><br>  Extensions derived from Joomla !, and Joomla!  licensed under the GNU GPL.  Thus, extensions can not be licensed under a more permissive license.  They cannot give their users and subsequent users the few rights that they can obtain under the terms of the GPL.  GPL-compatible licenses do not guarantee that subsequent users will have the same rights as current users.  Therefore, their use in derivative from Joomla!  the work violates the terms on which the right holders have licensed their code, which falls under the terms of the GNU GPL. <br><br>  For more than two years, the Joomla!  Project explicitly states that, in our opinion and the opinion of legal experts, we consider the extensions under discussion almost always as derivative works in relation to Joomla and therefore they must be licensed under the terms of the GNU GPL. <br><br>  See the following materials for additional explanations: <br>  <a href="http://www.fsf.org/licensing/licenses/gpl-faq.html">www.fsf.org/licensing/licenses/gpl-faq.html</a> <br>  <a href="https://wordpress.org/news/2009/07/themes-are-gpl-too/">http://wordpress.org/development/2009/0..e-gpl-too /</a> <br><br>  _____________ <br><br>  <i>approx.</i>  <i>per.</i>  <i>- My other CMS licensing translations:</i> <br><br><ul><li>  <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/post/280228/">Drupal licensing FAQ</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/post/282205/">Backdrop Licensing FAQ</a> </li></ul><br><br></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/282243/">https://habr.com/ru/post/282243/</a></p>
