      The company Raspberry <a href="https://habr.com/ru/news/t/457388/">introduced a new model of its miniature computer Raspberry Pi 4</a> .  The cost of the device is about $ 35.  The developers claim that the capabilities of the new device are almost the same as those of a full-fledged personal computer.  Moreover, now ‚ÄúMalinka‚Äù supports work simultaneously with two monitors with a resolution of 4K. <br><br>  As for the price, $ 35 is the version with 1 GB of memory.  Versions with 2 and 4 GB will cost customers $ 45 and $ 55, respectively.  Also, developers warn buyers that representatives from different countries will have to pay extra - import taxes, both external and internal, has not been canceled. <br><br><h3>  On the USE, you can search for information on the network </h3><br>  Specialists of the Federal Institute of Pedagogical Measurements <a href="https://habr.com/ru/news/t/457664/">have decided to allow online search of information on the Unified State Exam and OGE</a> on humanitarian subjects after they <a href="https://habr.com/ru/news/t/457664/">have been converted to</a> electronic form.  Now in many schools during the state examinations establish silencers communication.  In the future, this will not happen; on the contrary, a number of questions in tests will be designed to test the student's ability to search for information on the network. <br><br>  Director of FIPI Oksana Reshetnikova told in an interview with Izvestia that during exams in subjects of the natural science cycle, tasks with video fragments and experiments on a digital model may appear.  According to FIPI estimates, it will take about five years to develop and test innovations. <br><br><h3>  Introduced Russian processor for neural networks </h3><br>  The Scientific and Technical Center "Module" has <a href="https://habr.com/ru/news/t/457856/">developed a processor for creating neural networks</a> .  This chip is presented at the ‚ÄúArmy-2019‚Äù exhibition held in the Moscow region.  A company spokesman said that neurochips are based on NeuroMatrix's own architecture, using the ARM core for a number of functions. <br><br>  First of all, these chips are designed for the army, but they can be used in civilian life.  For example, for the implementation of various projects of "smart cities", in unmanned vehicles, medicine, etc.  The processor has already interested a number of Russian companies, including the military technopolis "Era". <br><br><h3>  Roskomnadzor not going to block VPN-services that do not comply with the requirements of the law </h3><br>  This week, Roskomnadzor stated that <a href="https://habr.com/ru/news/t/457858/">it would not block VPN services</a> that ignore the requirements of Russian legislation in terms of non-connection to the Federal State Information System.  This was reported by a source who is close to Roskomnadzor.  According to this source, it is more profitable for the department to penalize services than to block.  But what to do if the service does not agree to pay the fine is not yet clear. <br><br>  Yesterday, the head of Roskomnadzor, Alexander Zharov, said: ‚ÄúWe have the right to block VPN services that do not comply with the law, but there is no obligation to do this at any particular time.  There are nine services that do not execute the law.  We may wait for the adoption of a new law on fines.  We are not ready to discuss a specific plan of our actions. ‚Äù <br><br><h3>  The neural network was taught to undress women, and after a few days the project closed. </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/8b6/f1a/26f/8b6f1a26f7e4a3ad349661b6d5c55522.jpg"><br><br>  The other day, an application was launched <a href="https://habr.com/ru/news/t/457938/">that allowed people to ‚Äúundress‚Äù in photos</a> .  If you upload a snapshot of a woman in a bathing suit, then the neural network, determining the parameters of the body, complements the picture, removing all clothes.  At the same time, in the free version, undressing is incomplete, in order to ‚Äúrip off all covers‚Äù, it was necessary to pay $ 50. <br><br>  A few days later the project was closed.  As it turned out, the project turned out to be so popular that its creators simply were not prepared for such an influx of visitors. <br><br><h3>  Commodore 64 will be available in winter </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f53/02d/285/f5302d2853d4e27e746bad31314b06e4.jpg"><br><br>  <a href="https://habr.com/ru/news/t/458024/">Commodore 64 computer retro-emulator</a> will be available this winter.  It was developed by the company Retro Games, which previously released a smaller copy of the PC, but now launches the sale of the device with a functioning full-size keyboard. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4yOch48SScs" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  Device buyers can switch between three different emulator modes: C64, VIC 20, and Games Carousel.  For users who are familiar with commands like Load "*", 8.1 will work 100% emulation mode. <br><br><h3>  In Russia, the monitoring system for all cars will start soon. </h3><br>  In 2021, <a href="https://habr.com/ru/news/t/458028/">a system of tracking all cars will be launched</a> in Russia.  Avtodata‚Äôs special service navigation and telematics platform will collect and analyze data on vehicles and their owners from various information systems.  According to the developers, the service is launched in the interests of insurance companies. <br><br>  ‚ÄúThe service will allow classifying all types of drivers and transmitting data on driving to insurance companies for individual calculation of the cost of CTP and CASCO policies,‚Äù said Yaroslav Fedoseyev.  ‚ÄúIntelligent data processing is carried out using classification algorithms and regressive analysis, as a result, the vehicle‚Äôs driving style is assessed according to a certain scale and attributed to the relevant risk group.‚Äù </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/458144/">https://habr.com/ru/post/458144/</a></p>
