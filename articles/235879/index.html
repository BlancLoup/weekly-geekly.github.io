Did the company, which previously specialized mainly on secure smartphones, succeed in realizing its vision? <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e75/c11/91e/e75c1191e4c54c4d90d0b36e6eacf65c.jpg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><h4>  Specifications Senseit L301 </h4>  <b>Communication</b> - 2G: GSM 850/900/1800/1900 MHz;  3G: WCDMA 900/2100 MHz <br>  <b>Bluetooth</b> - 3.0 <br>  <b>Wi-Fi</b> - 802.11b / g / n <br>  <b>Number of SIM-cards</b> - 2 Dual SIM Dual Standby (DSDS); <br>  <b>Navigation</b> - GPS, A-GPS <br>  <b>Display</b> - FWVGA TFT, 4.5 " <br>  <b>Display resolution</b> - 480x854, 240 ppi <br>  <b>Type of touch layer</b> - capacitive, multitouch <br>  <b>Camera</b> - 5 MP (autofocus, flash), <br>  <b>Front camera</b> - 0.3 MP <br>  <b>The processor</b> - MediaTek MT6572AW ,, 2 cores, 1.2 GHz <br>  <b>Video chip</b> - Mali-400MP <br>  <b>Memory</b> - 512 MB <br>  <b>Drive</b> - 4 GB <br>  <b>Memory Card Support</b> - MicroSD up to 32 GB <br>  <b>Multimedia</b> - FM radio, audio jack: 3.5 mm <br>  <b>Operating System</b> - Android 4.2 Jelly Bean <br>  <b>Power</b> - 1 700 mAh, removable <br>  <b>Weight</b> - 143 grams <br>  <b>Sensors</b> - gyroscope, accelerometer, compass, light sensor, proximity sensor <br>  <b>Dimensions</b> - 135 x 67 x 11 mm; <br>  <b>Special</b> - Emergency button, flashlight <br>  <b>Price</b> - 6 490 rubles <br><br><h4>  Equipment </h4>  Senseit L301 is equipped with an adapter for mains supply, a Micro-USB cable, a wired headset with a small plastic clip (it does not seem to be particularly reliable), a protective film for the display.  However, the main feature of this kit is the presence of a docking station.

    <img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b09/5d8/5f7/b095d85f7b544ddcb0d76d9c2f56a974.jpg"><br><br>  It does not have any additional functions, but its main task is to perform well in the process of charging the phone and save the user from messing with the Micro USB cable. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/bc2/5e8/f32/bc25e8f32cce4b6281da6f5a8b2697b0.jpg"><br><br>  Rubber feet on the base of the docking station adhere firmly to the surface and eliminate the possibility of slipping. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/3a7/0cf/7cf/3a70cf7cf7b14f13ac373d7c75c109ce.jpg"><br><br>  The smartphone reliably lays down in the deepening provided for it and does not walk. <br><br><h4>  Design and controls, ergonomics </h4>  Senseit L301 is available in two colors - black and white.  A model with a light design has been tested.  With dimensions of 135 x 67 x 11 mm, the smartphone does not seem massive and, due to the rounded edges, lies comfortably in the hand. <br>  The first thing that catches the eye when considering the device is the features of controls.  Three touch keys, responsible for basic operations in the Android OS, are significantly larger than those of most devices. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/00c/5de/a18/00c5dea188ee484dbcd3b134ab28f9e4.JPG"><br><br>  On the left side of the L301 there are two sliding switches that are easily distinguishable to the touch.  The upper one is responsible for the function of the FM radio.  What is interesting, it is not necessary to connect headphones to listen to the radio.  The receiver works due to the built-in antenna. <br>  The lower switch activates the flashlight.  He is not very bright, but is able to help out in difficult times.  If it is difficult to light up the road with its help, then in order to highlight the keyhole or help find the keys in the bag, it fits perfectly. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/12b/003/de8/12b003de85744903ad5f0b8f5c01062a.jpg"><br><br>  On the right is a red unlock button.  Above it is a volume rocker, and below it is a key activating a camera. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/620/f38/017/620f380170384a86a754c3767f2e496c.jpg"><br><br>  Finally, another outstanding detail is the red SOS button on the back of the phone.  Its functionality will be discussed in detail below in the section on software. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/1e2/933/c9d/1e2933c9d33d48acbca6154921dc4ded.jpg"><br><br>  The last element to be noted is the hole for the lace at the bottom of the machine. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/9c7/bcd/890/9c7bcd890bcd4c43a7df213fb947397e.jpg"><br><br>  It is obvious that the manufacturer has done a lot to achieve high ergonomic performance L301 and in general - he succeeded.  Some remarks can be made regarding the marzime of the body of the white version of the L301 and the clarity of the SOS button.  The latter is pressed indistinctly and has a small power reserve, in order to be sure of pressing it is necessary to press on it exactly in the middle. <br>  The user who wants to use the lace, will face the fact that the smartphone does not fit in the docking station.  It should have provided the appropriate seizure. <br>  The build quality does not cause any complaints, the plastic case lacks a bit of torsional rigidity, but for everyday use, small squeaks are not critical. <br><br><h4>  Screen </h4>  Senseit L301 is equipped with a fairly high-quality TFT screen with a resolution of 854x480 pixels and support for two simultaneous touches.  In general, the image makes a favorable impression, but it is affected by a small margin of brightness and the fact that when the phone is tilted in a vertical plane, the colors are inverted and quickly fade.  When tilted to the right and left of this effect is not observed. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f49/ca9/100/f49ca910070249c3936b1b663a6ce417.jpg"><br>  The display coating is plastic and without a complete film will soon be covered with minor defects. <br>  The sensitivity of the sensory layer is sufficient, and it is almost impossible to miss the large menu items. <br><br><h4>  Software </h4> Android 4.2.2 provides the L301, but at first glance it can be difficult to determine this.  The pre-installed GUI is significantly different from the traditional interface. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/68c/db1/2ff/68cdb12ffcd446b0a75323f31f643e8f.jpg"><br><br>  During its creation, above all, emphasis was placed on simplicity and convenience.  The place of standard labels was taken by bright tiles with well distinguishable signatures, and the launcher‚Äôs functionality was somewhat simplified.  Justified step, if we take into account the positioning Senseit L301. <br>  Only three desktops are available for the user without the possibility of adding new ones  The only weather widget supported by the launcher is located on the home screen.  Add your own, again, will not work. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/eab/192/77c/eab19277c52b406f8edd582ee1ab5bf8.jpg"><br><br>  The settings menu was divided into two subsections, in one of which the most frequently used and necessary items were located, and in the other a complete set of settings.  Especially for users with poor eyesight system fonts are increased (the only pre-installed application, some of the inscriptions in which remained small, this is a calendar). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f0b/dc1/0f8/f0bdc10f8fc44d8090cb5c9f146e9895.jpg"><br><br>  Pressing the SOS button activates a call to a pre-designated number (it is important to note that the speakerphone mode is activated afterwards, so the phone does not have to be held) or an alarm siren (the audio signal is played through the main speaker, but you cannot call it really loud). <br>  Additional functionality is implemented through the company's GPS tracking service MobiTrack. <br>  By activating a free subscription, the user gets access to a personal account on the site, through which you can track the movements of the device (data is transmitted to the server via the Internet connection every five minutes).  MobiTrack stores route history and is able to complete the route, even if data on a part of the points were not received.  There is an opportunity to customize geofences.  If the owner of the device enters or exits such a zone, MobiTrack will issue a notification.  E-mail alerts, by the way, come without noticeable delays. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/1b9/bcf/7f2/1b9bcf7f21054e97aeade750173a700b.jpg"><br><br>  Paid subscription somewhat expands the functionality of the service, but there is no great need for its acquisition.  The need for paid tariffs can only arise if you need to track three or four devices. <br>  In addition to the unremarkable pre-installed applications of social networks, galleries, voice recorder, skype and browser, a tile with an inscription "magnifier" was discovered.  Digital zoom can really help to make out the text, but this application cannot be called a complete replacement for the magnifying glass because the picture is very noisy. <br><br><h4>  Wireless interfaces </h4>  Work with two SIM-cards is implemented successfully.  The item "SIM Management" allows you to precisely limit the functionality of each of them and manually adjust the order for voice calls, Internet access from each of the two cards. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/48e/8bb/bde/48e8bbbde1e043858ae8c7548295a31d.jpg"><br><br>  Specified in the specifications of the smartphone Dual Standby mode ensures the simultaneous operation of two cards, but only at the reception.  During a call, only the active SIM card has access to the mobile network.  The volume of the voice speaker is more than enough, but the complete headset of stars from the sky is not enough. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b4f/2ef/e5d/b4f2efe5d78744d8a5ce9fea31561b21.JPG"><br><br>  Also, the functionality is somewhat limited by the fact that only one of the cards can work in 3G networks, the second one functions only in second-generation networks.  Wi-Fi and Bluetooth perform their functions normally, no problems were fixed in their work. <br><br>  The GPS cold start takes up to 7 minutes, the positioning accuracy is quite high, but in areas with very dense building up the signal can be lost. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/957/bf4/3bb/957bf43bbcfc47d6a9ea18b8819b087c.jpg"><br><br>  Outdoors, the FM receiver works flawlessly, even though there is no external antenna, which the headset can perform.  A search by radio station yields 45 results in the range from 87.5 to 104.7 MHz. In the same room, the number of received radio stations is reduced to 28. Aired recording and a small list of favorites are available, which can be replenished with five favorite radio stations. <br><br><h4>  Performance </h4>  The positioning model of this device itself does not imply the need for high performance, so the use of the MediaTek MT6572AW dual-core chipset (1.2 GHz) cannot be attributed to the shortcomings of the smartphone. <br>  The interface works quite briskly, performance allows you to comfortably play 2D and undemanding 3D games.  As for video decoding, the L301 copes well with short videos and streaming video resolutions up to 480p.  Attempts to play large video files were unsuccessful. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/7cb/ccb/8de/7cbccb8deb234920a3404cef6fedce6a.jpg"><br><br>  In the universal AnTuTu Senseit L301 scored 10,926 points, and in the performance-oriented 3D graphics Bonsai Benchmark scored 1015 points.  The amount of RAM is 512 MB, of which about 150 MB remains free, 4 GB is built in, but only 1.3 GB is available to the user.  Memory cards up to 32 GB are supported. <br><br><h4>  Battery life </h4>  The battery with a capacity of 1700 mAh, it would seem, does not promise a long working time, but the L301 processor is quite economical in terms of power consumption, and the user scenarios for which the smartphone is designed do not imply ultrahigh loads.  The manufacturer claims 12 hours of talk time and up to 340 hours of standby time. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/21e/4f0/06f/21e4f006f7d64128bbb185be42b5d3dd.JPG"><br><br>  In fact, with moderate use of this smartphone, you can expect about two days of battery life.  Using such a function as a schedule for turning on / off the phone can add about a day to this deadline.  However, these figures do not take into account the power consumption of the GPS module, but much depends on the frequency of updating MobiTrack data and the quality of signal reception from the satellite.  In the process of testing with enabled tracking, the phone worked without recharging for about eleven hours.  Full recharging takes about three hours. <br><br><h4>  Camera </h4>  There are no surprises here, the smartphone is equipped with 5 megapixel main and 0.3 megapixel front cameras.  It takes about a second to launch the main camera, about the same is needed in order to take a picture.  The main camera is equipped with autofocus, and the advantages include the physical button used to start the camera and ‚Äúrelease the shutter‚Äù. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/32c/164/e1b/32c164e1b7aa40a9bfaa2d692c2e4032.jpg"><br><br>  The camera application does not provide any special features. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/32c/164/e1b/32c164e1b7aa40a9bfaa2d692c2e4032.jpg"><br><br>  There are four already become standard shooting modes (Normal, HDR, Smile Capture, Panorama).  You can shoot in series of 3 or 6 frames. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/218/777/9bc/2187779bc5f64819b1212a8f04724d31.jpg"><br><br>  The photo lacks brightness, there are problems with color reproduction, sometimes autofocus fails.  Decent frames can be obtained only with good natural light.  However, you can judge the quality of the pictures yourself by looking at the illustrations. <br><br><h4>  Conclusion </h4>  In the case of the Senseit L301 manufacturer, on the basis of unremarkable components to create an interesting niche device. <br>  Probably, in the future we will see many more similar solutions, but for the time being, the Senseit L301 has virtually no competitors. <br><br>  <b>Pros:</b> <br><ul><li>  Large interface and large fonts </li><li>  Ergonomic body </li><li>  Custom SOS button </li><li>  FM without radio headset </li><li>  Docking station included </li></ul><br>  <b>Minuses:</b> <br><ul><li>  Low performance and low RAM </li><li>  May not like: </li><li>  Pretty brand body in white </li><li>  Relatively high cost </li></ul><br><br>  Do not forget to follow us on <a href="http://vk.com/boxoverview">Vkontakte</a> , <a href="http://twitter.com/box_overview">Twitter</a> and <a href="https://plus.google.com/u/0/communities/108620202455758035379">Google+</a> !
