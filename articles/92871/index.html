These networks operate on the principle of platforms where you could hang your goods.  The source is not very fresh, but there are not so many reviews on this topic even in the English-speaking party.  Here it is not just about online stores with one provider (although this can now become the topic of the day - when shopping areas are so expensive and much cheaper to set up a website and trade online) - here is a list of sites where you can post goods for free. <br><br>  Many thanks in advance for all the comments. <br>  ______________________________________________________________________ <br><br>  What is <i>social shopping</i> ?  If you take and mix, as in a blender, work with <i>social bookmarking</i> , activity in social networks ( <i>social networking</i> ) and test (comparative) purchases (the result is a hybrid called <i>social shopping</i> . <a name="habracut"></a>

      Recently, a great variety of social shopping resources has appeared, opening up a whole sea of ‚Äã‚Äãopportunities for online sellers to find their customers through low-cost marketing, which works by word-of-mouth. <br>  We did a study of many different sites, where you, as a seller, could put your products on sale online, and in this review we give you a brief summary of the features of each of them. <br>  Since you never know where the customer will come to you (and the sale will happen), you may want to publish your products (offers) wherever possible, and in this way you can track which of the resources are really useful and which of them are just waste of time. <br><br>  <b>List of Social Shopping Bookmarking Sites (or ‚ÄúSocial Wishlists‚Äù)</b> <br><br>  Here is a list of sites where you can bookmark products, set tags, share information about your products, and even run a blog about products you sell if you like.  Some resources allow you to even join groups, or make money from the fact that you vote for someone's product and increase its rating. <br>  Here's a piece of advice: if you are going to publish there goods or products of own production, do not even think to treat the issue of tagging carelessly.  Search for the most popular matching tags, <br>  (As a rule, these are the tags that are most sought after. They are usually the most targeted, and also do not forget special terms to maximize the likelihood that your products will be found in the search. <br><br>  <b><a href="http://www.stylefeeder.com/">Style feeder</a></b> <br><br>  Allows users to join groups, create lists of products that you want to buy, so-called wish lists, wish to send product data (product page) to a friend, add product lists to your blog, or MySpace profile . <br><br>  <b><a href="http://www.kaboodle.com/">Kaboodle</a></b> <br><br>  Allows you to add a small java script program, saved as a bookmark in the browser (bookmarklet) and - let's go!  The resource allows you to search for a product / product by category, allows you to maintain a list of users, add friends, join groups, and comment on products and users.  Kaboodle automatically creates descriptions when you bookmark a product page. <br><br>  The Wists feature - Wists (Means weblists - do you understand?) - allows users to save all their lists of desired products (wishlists) in one place, instead of opening each online store separately.  The ‚ÄúCopy &amp; Paste‚Äù feature for the product / product description may seem too complicated for someone, but you have more control over it than when auto-generating the description.  And if you want to take advantage of the bookmarking feature, see the Wists section in action. <br><br>  <b><a href="http://www.stylehive.com/">Style hive</a></b> <br><br>  In addition to the usual functions: creating a bookmark (bookmark) / adding comments, options to join groups and add friends, you can also follow the events of your friends / ‚Äúfollow‚Äù or selectively watch updates from unfamiliar users a la Twitter.  They also included the social media 1.0 feature: forum. <br><br>  <b><a href="http://www.thisnext.com/">thisnext</a></b> <br>  It is possible to bookmark products, send a product page to friends by email, subscribe to RSS feeds and participate in rankings for other users.  It does not seem that there is a function to add friends - for now.  This resource has two ways to add your product: you specify the name, URL, or UPC product code, or add an icon to the browser and bookmark the product - on its page.  You can hang up ‚ÄúShopcast‚Äù - a request for shopping - by adding a badge or a feed to your list - to your blog.  Hi designers - blog posts look really cool. <br><br>  <b><a href="http://www.desiresin.com/">desiresin</a></b> <br><br>  Some social features are missing: for example, you cannot add a community, but you can paint tags for your products.  Unfortunately, this attracts a lot of irrelevant spam, which appears in the top of all product lists (without pictures for it) and the design of the resource can not be compared with all other sites, however, this site can be used to post your own products. <br><br>  <b><a href="http://www.productwiki.com/">Productwiki</a></b> <br>  A wiki-based social network where you can add a product, subscribe to RSS feeds, mark the products ‚Äúlove it / like / I like,‚Äù ‚Äúwant it / I want‚Äù and ‚Äúhave it / I have.‚Äù <br><br>  <b>Next section: Social Deals and Community Coupons / Coupons Sites websites.</b> <br><br>  <b><a href="http://www.dealplumber.com/">dealplumber</a></b> <br>  Allows you to find and make a deal on specific products, allows you to view published coupons with codes and special offers on the Dealplumber database, or publish your product or coupons for products / goods on an affiliate program.  There are also the categories ‚ÄúFree Stuff‚Äù (free products) and ‚ÄúFree Shipping‚Äù free shipping. <br><br>  <b><a href="http://dealtagger.com/">Dealtagger</a></b> <br>  The ability to create a free list of products for sellers, yes, yes, this is true.  You add a button to the list of bookmarks on your toolbar, or post your sentences one by one.  Functions: join a group, post tags, view, and your contacts can see updates of your feed on Twitter. <br><br>  <b><a href="http://dealbundle.com/">Dealbundle</a></b> <br><br>  You can hang there a list of your offers, prices, you can go through other people's offers and repeat the same.  You can also make money if other users click on the AdSense link near your posts (published products).  (Sounds like an invitation to click on a post of friends ...) This site is actually in its infancy stage, there are not too many offers, categories or members published, but it‚Äôs still worth a look. <br><br>  <b><a href="http://dealspl.us/">dealsplus</a></b> <br><br>  Also, as is the case with the Dealcritic resource, but there is much better organization / categories and the ability to subscribe to RSS feeds for hot offers, either for all deals, or for offers to receive something - for free.  Plus Dealspl.us gives free distribution of contextual advertising. <br><br>  <b>Social resources / engines, providing an opportunity to conduct a comparative analysis of prices</b> <br><br>  Now let's talk about some of the ‚Äúgray‚Äù social shopping sites.  Below are the resources that make it possible to immediately sort by price, they have the functions of social shopping site, that is, either the free opportunity to submit your products to the site, and thus they are worth mentioning here - in order to attract them attention of the entire respected community of online merchants interested in building a wide network of sites to gain momentum. <br><br>  <a href="http://www.like.com/"><b>like.com</b></a> <br><br>  A search engine built on a visual search - which allows you to zoom in - and view product details as well as view similar names matched by color, shape, pattern, price, etc. The list of categories includes: watches, shoes, bags, jewelry, clothes <br>  Sellers can add individual products, or send their feed or link by sending an email. <br>  This is great if you already have an affiliate program, you can pay per click or for each sale, Like.com supports both models. <br><br>  <a href="http://www.etsy.com/"><b>Etsy</b></a> <br><br>  This is not your grandmother's flea market.  Modern Etsy exclusively gives lists of hand made products, they extinguish all with their Web 2.0 gadgets, because of which everyone simply clings to this resource - including the Geolocator / geolocator function and Shop by Color / Buy by color.  Users can create their own treasure lists / Lists of Treasury.  Sellers can register their username in the username.etsy.com domain for free, and can hang up lists of their products at $ 0.20 per lot, with a fee of 3.5% for each sale.  Listings live for 4 months. <br><br>  <a href="http://www.crowdstorm.co.uk/"><b>Crowdstorm</b></a> <a href="http://www.crowdstorm.co.uk/"><br></a> <br>  Crowdstorm is similar to MySpace, Digg and Shopping.com if you mix them all together.  You can build your own network, recommend products (goods) with the ‚ÄúRecommend‚Äù function (rating voting system is the same as on Digg) and you can also search and view products like on any other shopping engine with the function of comparing offers.  It‚Äôs easy to submit your products - but the problem is - users will be redirected to Amazon or Ebay to make a real purchase.  That is, it will work for you in the best way only if you are already an online seller who already uses these channels. <br><br>  <a href="http://www.hawkee.com/"><b>Hawkee</b></a> <br><br>  Sounds like a playground, suitable for selling a collection of your toy soldiers on it?  Let's think again. <br>  Hawkee is a social network for technical fans, where you will find offers and discount coupons, bundled by users, as well as product reviews, and code snippets, apart from comparative shopping itself.  Hawkee uses feeds directly from merchants, not from other shopping resources, and you can contact the seller in writing to get more information about the products on the site. <br><br>  Shopwiki <br>  A search engine ‚Äî which goes on the web, and pickups products from online merchants ‚Äî by itself.  Unfortunately, some products are outdated. <br>  Really cool colored serch. <br>  Does not accept feeds from merchants, but you can add your URL to the online store here.  Or read more information on how to get on the list. <br><br>  <a href="http://www.yub.com/"><b>Yub</b></a> <br><br>  A related Buy.com social resource with the function of comparative offers is on Yub.com (The word Buy is just the opposite) - here you can see a list of 6 million products, get discounts - when part of the amount is refunded from the purchase price, and do shopping together with your friends.  Here you can write a review article and make money from it - if users buy something as a result of reading it. <br>  The Meet People feature is a three-point throw in the direction of copying MySpace.  Another reason to have an account and sell on Buy.com. <br><br>  There are definitely a lot of interesting things for research in this area, and we are all interested in exactly how the social shoposphere will develop in the future, however, for this to happen, it is necessary for a wide audience to know as much as possible about them. <br><br>  ____________________________________________________________________ <br>  Notes: two links were removed from the list - they could not be opened. <br>  <b>Questions to the audience:</b> <br>  1) Do you use shopping networks - not as a buyer, but as a seller?  2) Are there any good Russian and English examples that you could add to the list? <br>  3) Do you think this type of business is promising for the Russian-speaking Internet? <br>  4) What examples could you add to this list?  Are there any Russian-speaking resources that you could bring (with comparable attendance)? </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/92871/">https://habr.com/ru/post/92871/</a></p>
