Part 2</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  UPD: <b><a href="http://scandi.habrahabr.ru/blog/68179/">Part 1</a></b> <br><br>  So, at the request of workers, telling how the story ended with the exchange of marriage in the company Logitech. <br><br>  It turned out that in a week I was unable to overcome myself and destroy the keyboard.  And not only in my case.  It was necessary to urgently finish the repair in the apartment and dump it from the removable hut.  And in general it turned out that I missed all the terms. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  What I immediately informed the autoinformer from the site Logitech.  Like a week has passed, but Herman is not.  We consider breakage eliminated. <br>  I had to write a tearful letter that moving a dangerous thing.  All devices in the boxes.  Boxes are packed.  And life is over.  And I write to you from the parent Pentium 500, because there is no other company at hand.  Do not misunderstand me and give a couple more weeks for the settling of life. <br>  Honestly, I basically already scored.  Do not raise the status of the application, and to hell with him.  But no.  The next day I saw that the application was in the waiting status and they were waiting for pictures from me.

      Okay.  Repair completed, moved, all unpacked and set to work.  And here again a reminder from Logitech.  Well.  Once you insist, here you are. <br><br>  I take the first photos and send them. <br><br><img src="http://scandi.org/i/logitech/IMGP2000.JPG" alt="image"><br><img src="http://scandi.org/i/logitech/IMGP2001.JPG" alt="image"><br><br>  They ask me, before it is too late, to send me a photo with the full lace shown. <br>  Wow  Okay.  I do. <br><img src="http://scandi.org/i/logitech/IMGP2002.JPG" alt="image"><br><br>  I get confirmation that you can beat.  Eh ... <br><br>  Rereading the kamenty to the previous post and finding that everyone was in order to beat, took a bigger hammer, good from the repairmen there were already a few pieces left, and went to the hall to beat. <br><br>  My wife is standing and horning over me.  I beat, and the keyboard at least to hell.  Even the buttons do not fly away.  Onazh dog iron.  The case is not bent, the buttons are in place, and if you hit it from the back side, the hammer will just spring back and that's it.  Having rummaged for about 15 minutes, when I had already ceased to love this clave, I did an unexpected act for myself and just bent it. <br><br><img src="http://scandi.org/i/logitech/IMGP2003.JPG" alt="image"><br><br>  Sent where it should and dialed the number of the support. <br>  They started talking to me again in broken Russian.  Asked to wait.  Type, we now check, and whether everything is correct. <br><br>  - Da ya podtvergdayu, klaviatura dostatochno unichtozhena. <br><br>  Phew  Lightened.  Not enough.  After I bent her like that, her only one key flew out.  I'm not even sure that if you include clav right now, then maybe it will work. <br><br>  Well, not the essence.  I was told that everything is OK, wait for the package within 2 weeks. <br><br>  The next day I received a letter from UPS saying that the package had been formed for me, and after another 2 days I received this. <br><br><img src="http://scandi.org/i/logitech/IMGP2042.JPG" alt="image"><br><img src="http://scandi.org/i/logitech/IMGP2044.JPG" alt="image"><br><img src="http://scandi.org/i/logitech/IMGP2045.JPG" alt="image"><br><img src="http://scandi.org/i/logitech/IMGP2046.JPG" alt="image"><br><img src="http://scandi.org/i/logitech/IMGP2047.JPG" alt="image"><br><br>  That's how they look together :-) <br><br><img src="http://scandi.org/i/logitech/IMGP2049.JPG" alt="image"><br><br>  Based on the delivery time, I will assume that the warehouse and office are in Moscow.  And in principle, it is possible not to hit the goods with a hammer, but simply to bring them, but nobody needs it.  It's easier. <br><br>  Sorry for the crumpled ending.  That's basically my whole story. <br>  I am very sorry that in the process of moving I lost the Logitech mouse, which had not worked since the moment of purchase.  Now I would exchange it too :-) <br><br>  Good luck everyone. <br>  Until. <br><br>  UPD: Transferred to techsapport. <br>  UPD: At the request of readers, I post two keyboards next to each other. <br><img src="http://scandi.org/i/logitech/IMGP2051.JPG" alt="image"><br><img src="http://scandi.org/i/logitech/IMGP2054.JPG" alt="image"></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/70582/">https://habr.com/ru/post/70582/</a></p>
