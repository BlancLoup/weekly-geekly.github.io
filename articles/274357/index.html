It was extremely strange to see Mark Hamill and Kiefer Sutherland discuss games, while while my face is shown in close-up on all projectors.  I am very pleased, do not misunderstand, but I also want to be frank: this was the first in four years real confirmation that yes, the work on the project alone was worth it.  In addition to feeling happy and being able to tell your story of a ‚Äúlone wolf‚Äù to thousands of people in Los Angeles, there are several other advantages of working alone. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><iframe src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://player.vimeo.com/video/147538528&amp;xid=17259,15700021,15700186,15700191,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhgzuC0L8eVBdlWgNp3Edf5akWUpQg" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" title="Made with Unity: Thomas" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  A few years ago, when I entered college, I created a game called Coma.  These were the last days of the glory of developing flash games;  As a result, I found myself in the spotlight, smiling for photographers at GDC 2010 in Austin (TX).  I felt great, but soon I began to wonder if it was just random luck.  The feeling of realization began to fade after days, weeks and years of late work at night on my current adventure Pinstripe.  Today I am full of hopes that I am doing everything right: year after year, I follow my passion.  However, the rest of the time it seems to me that it was a big mistake to take on the project alone.  At such moments, it is easy to recall the past few years and ask the question: ‚ÄúWhy didn‚Äôt I just create a small team of developers?  You could have a couple more games and become a millionaire. ‚Äù  (Sarcasm).

By integrity, I mean the effective interaction of all artistic elements.  Outstanding games usually have holistic music, style, gameplay and history.  Ultimately, these elements are used together to create an exciting atmosphere.  This is a bit like how voice, posture, manners, clothes and eye color play an important role in creating a unique personality.  I think that games also feel the same way, so you need to use this principle in the design. <br><br>  Of course, everything is fine in theory, but I was often tempted to end this ‚Äúlone wolf‚Äù lifestyle.  I have a folder full of unsent emails to people who could be my artists, musicians, etc., but in the end, the most important thing for me was the ability to fully express my vision.  In my case, the easiest way to achieve this was by clenching my teeth and doing everything alone.  For example, I am inclined to believe that music is the source of the strength of the game.  If the music does not match the artistic style and mood of the game, the sensations from it will be confusing.  The illustrations in Pinstripe have a personality, and it would be very difficult for me to explain how the music should fit this style.  Not impossible - the transfer of ideas is the task of the video game industry - but difficult, especially for me.  My budget and time requirements, as well as my choosy nature, said that it would be better to devote a couple of months to this and record the music on my own.  I understand that from the outside it looks self-centered, but the end goal has always been a holistic game that has a connection with the player on an emotional level. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/037/de9/c5c/037de9c5c2a04fba80dc359e030d970c.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  As a vivid example of such a process, you can take the ‚ÄúForest on the Edge‚Äù (Edge Wood) ( <i>translator's note - the game has not yet come out, so you can only guess about the correct translation of the name, I chose this</i> ).  ‚ÄúForest on the edge‚Äù is the first level of Pinstripe, cozy and snowy, but located in the middle of Hell.  I'm not quite sure that such an entourage will ‚Äúhook‚Äù players, but I want to think that even the craziest story can work with the right music, artistic style and atmosphere.  After recording four completely different musical compositions for ‚ÄúForest on the Edge,‚Äù three artistic styles and changing character sets, which I refused as a result, I felt that ‚ÄúThe Forest on the Edge‚Äù had reached the point of emotional response.  It was a long process, but the result was worth it, and I am pleased with what was done.  I can imagine how expensive such a movement would be without a definite direction when using hired specialists;  much more expensive it would cost when working with close friends.  I am sure that this is one of the main reasons why teams of indie developers are falling apart - one starving artist is trying to change the world with his game, but he cannot decide what the first level will be.  Without a team, despite the high load, the burden is often light, and leaves room for creativity and individuality. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b18/4db/b64/b184dbb641034139b41bcd7d887e2ed3.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  When there is only me, a cup of coffee and a couple of ideas in the early morning before going to work, a personal game like Pinstripe has the opportunity to become something more than its author.  Creating my game, which can be completed in a couple of hours, took almost three years, but I hope that someday players will thank me for it.  The style, music and plot of the Pinstripe were born from my heart.  The game has its own rhythm, which, I believe, is more likely to touch players on an emotional level than if it was created with help.  If the statistics are correct, I am doomed to earn five dollars on Steam, but still my game is already there.  My little beating heart will soon be represented by a small picture on the Steam window, and it seems to me that this is great. <br><br>  If you want to talk about your project, or just contact me, feel free to email at atmosgames [at] gmail.com. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/274357/">https://habr.com/ru/post/274357/</a></p>
