      If you already know who we are and what we are and just want to register more quickly, this can be done <a href="http://bit.ly/327FYJ5">here</a> .  And under the cut, we will tell you what awaits you this year. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/vy/65/a-/vy65a-hqb94gibwtywhnv7rp_-o.jpeg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The new stage of the school of mobile development Android Academy starts <b>on July 25, at Avito's office, at 19:00</b> .  We already <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/420573/">met with you</a> last summer, <a href="https://habr.com/ru/company/avito/blog/445586/">reported on the results of the Fundamentals course</a> , and now we want to share plans for this year. <br><br>  The new course is called Advanced, and in it we will tell things that from our point of view, every competent specialist needs to know. <br><br><h3>  Why are we doing this at all? </h3><br>  I think all of you know the feeling of satisfaction when you gave 100% and look at the result of your work.  And it is doubly pleasant when you laid out, and the result did not go to the table, did not become just another KPI.  When this result is a little bit, but improved something that is important to you.  For us, the development of the android-community in Russia is important, so that more developers appear who understand the importance of communicating with each other and know where they can come to share experience and knowledge.  This is important, because not everyone has mentors or older comrades who can help them develop. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/u_/6o/l8/u_6ol8nub2ybattiadgu5smwotg.jpeg"><br><br>  Personally, I still like to help other people understand something new.  I am very fascinated by the process of learning, and, helping others to understand something, I hear questions that I would not have asked myself.  I have to put into words what I think I know.  It helps to find weak spots and understand what I really know and what I don‚Äôt. <br><br>  In addition, it was wildly interesting to watch how people grow, what is interesting for them, just to communicate and make friends.  It was very cool when my students got to work at Yandex, and I am very proud of them.  But besides this, I am proud of all those who were with us, came to lectures, participated in the hackathon.  We all did a great job together, and it is a great joy to be part of such a powerful team. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/xj/22/4b/xj224bu9kwk4nq0r-wv7fpsahh4.jpeg"><br><br>  And the most pleasant thing is that it is not only we who feel it.  Here are some of the reviews that we collected after the lectures: <br><br><blockquote>  Everything is so cool that I can not believe it! </blockquote><br><blockquote>  The course is excellent!  Maximum useful information for a limited period of time.  It is especially valuable that the relevance of information was tightened right in real time (the same transition to androidx, for example), and not about some already outdated technologies told (and if told, it was only for general information, and warning about their obsolescence or imperfection ). <br><br>  Thanks again to everyone for the course!  And I look forward to its continuation :))) </blockquote><br><blockquote>  We will wait for new lectures from you:&gt; </blockquote><br><blockquote>  You are just super!  Everything is very cool, I never cease to admire your altruism and energy.  Thank you so much that you are. </blockquote><br>  Of course, not everything is so rosy, we also have useful critical reviews that we will try to take into account this year.  In particular, add more interactivity (: <br><br>  If last year you wanted to participate, but for some reason you could not, then this year there is a chance to try again!  But keep in mind that this year the course will be more difficult, and to get the benefit, you need to already understand the android to some extent. <br><br><h3>  What awaits you </h3><br>  This year the course will consist of 6 lectures for 1.5 hours every 2-3 weeks.  According to the results of stormy discussions, compilation of tables on the importance / interest and survey of students last year, we selected the following topics for the course program. <br><br><ul><li>  Advanced multithreading </li><li>  Optimizations </li><li>  Advanced &amp; Secure Networking </li><li>  Advanced architecture </li><li>  DI: How to and why </li><li>  Android Internals </li></ul><br>  Unlike last year‚Äôs course, there will be no homework, but there will be more interactive during the lectures themselves - questions not only from you, but also from lecturers to you, small tests for self-control, discussion. <br><br><h3>  When </h3><br>  The course will run from mid-July to the end of October.  In the first three lectures Avito again invites us to her, and we will tell you about the locations of the second half of the course in the process. <br><br>  All lectures are held offline, but our communication does not end there - there is a place for participants to communicate online.  This year we decided to move to Telegram, and a <a href="http://bit.ly/2XiXPcy">channel with announcements</a> and a <a href="http://bit.ly/2xoqS3V">chat for communication and questions</a> are open for you. <br><br><h3>  For whom </h3><br>  The Advanced course will be more specialized than Fundamentals, and we will talk in depth about things that it is important for a developer to continue developing. <br><br>  Therefore, we expect from you that: <br><br><ul><li>  You have already written one or more of your applications or are working as a junior and you want to develop further </li><li>  you know what architecture is in programming, what you need, you know why and how to divide the architecture into layers, </li><li>  or you have completed the Android Fundamentals course and want to continue learning. </li></ul><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/xs/s8/gw/xss8gwtxniefgisxb64exjcj8sc.jpeg"><br><br><h3>  Who we are </h3><br><hr><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/kf/9f/s0/kf9fs0q2v8wtnoxiku3vmwilgug.jpeg" width="220" align="left">  <b>Yonatan Levin, monday.com</b> <br><br>  Startupist to the bone marrow.
