Under the cat a story about our experience in implementing a system for collecting and recording utilities throughout the residential area. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Utility metering devices have long ceased to be simply a device with a rotating scale, looking at which, you begin to involuntarily estimate the future bill for a ‚Äúcommunal‚Äù.  With the ubiquity of the Internet, manufacturers began to supply metering devices with input-output devices that allow the transfer of data on utility consumption in real time. <br><br>  All this has led to the emergence and wide distribution of automated systems for commercial metering of electricity (AMR).  Over the years, hundreds of companies have already attempted to develop their own systems, but the actual operating systems that could provide all the stated capabilities have appeared only from some manufacturers.

      Several years ago, our specialists developed their own system of automated data collection on the consumption of utility resources - the software and hardware complex ‚ÄúNAGruzka‚Äù.  The system has already managed to establish itself in many interesting projects. <br><br><h3>  <b>What is ‚Äúload‚Äù?</b> </h3><br>  Unlike similar AMR systems, ‚ÄúNAGruzka‚Äù does not require replacing all the meters with a specific model, since it is based on modern principles of modular architecture, which means adding any metering device through writing a separate library (software module) for it.  In addition to polling continuous counters, the interface controller <a href="http://shop.nag.ru/catalog/06120.Konvertery-interfejsov">SNR-ERD</a> allows you to monitor the status of many different sensors and respond to incoming signals either by notifying a person or by running a ready script that can, for example, turn off the water in a pipe, turn off electricity, or vice versa. any device. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/000/703/a29/000703a29bdc4aed995a199462c0d945.png" alt="image"><br><br>  One of the clearest examples of the implementation of the system is the Akademichesky microdistrict in Yekaterinburg.  If you have ever been to the capital of the Middle Urals, you probably imagine how, even visually, the ‚ÄúAcademic‚Äù is different from the rest of the city. <br><br>  The neighborhood, in fact, is unique in its urban planning concept, which is based on the idea to bring the level of quality of life of the ordinary citizen to a completely different level.  For example, a video surveillance system is implemented here, thanks to which security can bring a resident to the house if any danger arises.  Only one call to the remote is needed. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d61/a89/b18/d61a89b180d241d992e09c6139b05f72.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Naturally, the area where they are trying to adhere to the highest standards of quality of life, needed a comprehensive system for metering consumption of utility resources.  Which, among other things, could allow residents to track consumption in real time. <br><br>  At the initial stage of construction, full automation of metering devices was not provided, but the situation was corrected on time.  Fortunately, for the needs of management companies, Rostelecom built an Ethernet network, which they began to use to transfer data from the devices to the console. <br><br>  When at Akademicheskiy they thought about introducing an automated control system, after sorting through several options, they turned to NAG.  First of all, <a href="http://nag.ru/articles/article/28926/-nagruzka-tolko-dlya-umnyih-rayonov.html">‚ÄúNAgruzka‚Äù was</a> implemented as a pilot project, installing sensors in one of the heat points.  All pipelines were taken under control, and all parameters were measured.  Data transmission over a wired channel was derived server.  At the next stage, the survey metering system began to be implemented in other homes everywhere. <br><br>  Now the management company has access to data on the consumption of resources by apartments in real time.  All of them are displayed on a computer monitor. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/697/65f/d5f/69765fd5fed841348ef383567a63bd46.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The system allows you to track both data on a separate apartment and general house indicators. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/3ea/19b/939/3ea19b93961c43b78d8ade4c856379d3.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Control thermal points <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a9c/76c/6ca/a9c76c6ca81044f890661eb613547396.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/3d0/366/46e/3d036646e15a4614baa8f5a349e2fc8b.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  and the operation of the filter pumping station. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d1f/876/54d/d1f87654d5d247d799d5ddb2a195d8fa.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  For convenience of analysis there is an opportunity to build a graph. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/077/ca2/82a/077ca282a8cc425daf5c1d7efc6137c2.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The ordinary consumer of communal resources also has its undoubted advantages from the work of ‚ÄúNagruzki‚Äù.  In the first place - it is the convenience of operation at the general accounting.  Dispatchers keep everything under their strict control and promptly react to any problems.  Errors that are possible when taking indicators manually are also excluded. <br><br>  The main plus of the system operating in Akademichesky is that all the equipment in the substation, all engineering systems, heat supply, parameters of hot water supply are monitored on a single console.  At the same time, not only the meter readings at the end of the month are monitored, but also all short-term technical parameters that, one way or another, are important for the normal functioning of engineering systems. <br><br>  The main difference between the Academic and similar projects is that here the entire automated accounting system is on a single console.  All engineering systems, heat supply, hot water supply - each parameter is under control.  And not only the one for which calculations are made for the calculation of payments, but also all the technological parameters that, one way or another, are important for the proper functioning of engineering systems.  That is why the automation system, located in a separate house, does not live its life, which, according to the regulations, the technician checks every two weeks, but is under round-the-clock monitoring in real time. <br><br><h3>  <b>As a result</b> <br></h3><br>  The experience of implementation and successful work of ‚ÄúNagruzka‚Äù in Akademichesky clearly showed the absence of any difficulties in the implementation of such systems.  Since the most important part of such a system is data networks.  Now they exist almost everywhere.  Also, the problem of the problem of data transmission is easily solved with the help of a mobile operator. <br><br>  The hardware is based on the ‚ÄúNAG‚Äù own development - depending on the customer‚Äôs requirements, it can be represented by the remote control and monitoring device <a href="http://shop.nag.ru/catalog/00007.Avtomatizatsiya-i-monitoring/05629.ERD-Kontrollery/13810.SNR-ERD-3c">SNR-ERD-3c</a> . <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/01f/9f9/09e/01f9f909eef347f38e845ac0ef280a29.jpg" alt="image"><br>  Or interface converter <a href="http://shop.nag.ru/catalog/06120.Konvertery-interfejsov/21099.SNR/15267.SNR-GSM-SERIAL-12-box">Octopus-GSM</a> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/01d/779/52c/01d77952c9384dd0ac68fe5a960c6afd.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  In development and more advanced hardware solutions. <br><br>  Of course, our specialists did not limit themselves to work in good conditions at an advanced urban construction site.  In addition to the "Academic", the introduction of "Nagruzki" is in much more difficult conditions. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/370313/">https://habr.com/ru/post/370313/</a></p>
