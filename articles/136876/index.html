I will try to do without a long introduction, and immediately proceed to the description of the method.  It does not pretend to universality and huge efficiency, but it can make life a little better and more successful. <br><br><h5>  We describe the problem </h5><br>  You sit on the Internet and suddenly wakes up.  She reminds about a bunch of unsolved problems.  Of course, you can make a strong-willed effort over yourself and once again plunge into the depths of your favorite resource, but this, unfortunately, is not the way out.  I offer the easiest way, for it will only need a piece of paper and a pencil. <br><a name="habracut"></a>

    <h5>  One good deed is one plus </h5><br>  Actually this is the whole method.  As soon as there is an idea to do a good thing, you immediately give yourself a plus and you are happy to set off to complete the task.  It sounds childishly naive, but such a simple action immediately increases motivation.  It doesn‚Äôt matter how complex the action you are going to perform: feed the cat, do gymnastics for the eyes or sketch out the architecture for the future web service. <br>  You can put the pros for every little thing, and you can only for those that have not dared to perform for a long time.  I put the advantages in those moments when I‚Äôm finishing meaningless surfing the Internet and get to work. <br><br><h5>  KISS principle in action </h5><br>  I will try to describe his positive qualities.  There are technologies of time management, in which literally everything is painted to the smallest detail.  But how many people can follow them?  What should be the warehouse of character for this?  Maybe I'm too lazy, but after a day or two I get tired of using them.  Few things were better with ToDo lists.  You can plan for as long as you wish, arranging the chains of necessary affairs.  And what to do, if tomorrow morning there is no desire to do it at all?  Where to get the motivation? <br>  Quite differently, I treated simple monosyllabic motivators.  A well-known tomato method, time for fun, an hour for fun or just do it.  When an idea is expressed in one sentence, it comes better to the soul or to the mind. <br>  Another advantage is that this approach forms the habit of doing useful and important actions.  Gradually, the brain gets used to look for outstanding tasks.  Immediately after the morning check of mail, an automatic list of important cases is formed. <br>  Plus motivation.  I'm not talking about cheating karma or reputation, but I think many people are pleased to see the advantages in their profile.  In the same way, it's nice to see a sheet filled with pluses after a busy and productive working day. <br><br><h5>  About cons </h5><br>  I am sure that everything has a reverse side of the medal, but I will not mention it.  Any crossed out minus turns into a plus. <br><br><h5>  Some lyrics </h5><br>  I hope someone will find this useful or at least interesting.  The method is easily executable, simple as scrap, but, despite this, I have not yet met it on the Internet.  If he has existed for many years, I beg you to generously forgive and forget the article as a bad dream. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/136876/">https://habr.com/ru/post/136876/</a></p>
