It was this that created the conditions for him to study in a dense way what he had a passion for all his life - science, engineering and space.  In March 1999, he founded X.com - one of the first services to provide functionality for selling services on the Internet, quickly becoming one of the leading financial companies on the Internet.  In 2000, X.com acquired Confinity and became PayPal, the international leader in payment transfers.  At PayPal, he served as president and director of production control and was his largest shareholder until Ebay bought PayPal in 2002 for $ 1.5 billion.  Before joining PayPal, Musk was one of the founders of Zip2, the company that created software for Internet services. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/53d/b51/348/53db51348cceac59285e7d9dbfae8fc7.jpg" width="600"><br>  <i>(on the photo: Peter Thiel and Elon Musk)</i> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  1995 - Zip2 </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/967/e43/7ae/967e437aec5b4e619a0b083a1740a600.jpg" align="left">  Musk and his brother Kimball founded the company Zip2, which specialized in software for news companies. <br><blockquote>  ‚ÄúI worked from morning till night.  He lived in the same warehouse, where he rented an office, and took a shower in the locker rooms of the local stadium.  But I saved on renting an apartment, and in the first two most difficult years I kept the company afloat. ‚Äù </blockquote><br>  In 1999, Zip2 was acquired by Compaq for $ 307 million.  Mask received 7% of the sale amount ($ 22 million).  ‚ÄúAfter Compaq acquired my offspring, it merged with Altavista,‚Äù Elon comments. <br><br><h4>  1998 - Confinity </h4><br>  Confinity began its operations in December 1998 as a cryptographic company for Palm (cryptography is one of the skills of Max Levchin).  Max Levchin developed an application for encryption.  It used infrared rays to transmit identification information from one Palm device to another.

Both systems (X.com and PayPal) were engaged in providing personal electronic money transfers via e-mail. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/756/799/07f/75679907f85274b27f657bf6df0f43aa.jpg" width="600"><br>  <i>(on the photo: Peter Thiel and Elon Musk)</i> <br><br>  From March to October 2000, Elon Musk served as CEO of PayPal.  In October, Peter Thiel became CEO. <br><br><h4>  2002 - selling eBay </h4><br>  In October 2002, PayPal was taken over by eBay for $ 1.5 billion. <br><br><hr><br>  A few reasons why Elon Mask should be considered a full co-founder of PayPal (without minimizing the roles of Max Levchin and Peter Thiel): <br><br>  <b>1.</b> According to LA Times David Sachs (PayPal COO, prior to its sale to eBay), it was Elon Mask who had the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãa ‚Äúviral‚Äù growth mechanism. <br><br>  <b>2. The</b> business model of charging fees only to a large seller, not to buyers or small dealers was developed by Elon Musk and other managers at X.com.  By applying this model, PayPal does not lose profit. <br><br>  <b>3.</b> A large number of valuable workers came from X.com <br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">more</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><ul><li>  Roelof Botha.  He was engaged in financial management and external value structure of capital.  While at the position of CFO, he led PayPal through a very difficult public offering stage.  Now he is busy with Sequoia.  In addition, he is one of the founders of the notorious YouTube. </li><li>  Amy Rowe Klement managed a group of various services at PayPal until 2006. </li><li>  Julia Anderson Ankenbrandt and Sal Giambanco, still Vice President of PayPal Human Resources.  They managed to create a customer support and fraud investigation team from scratch.  Their group consisted of hundreds of workers by the summer of 2000, when Elon Musk was still the CEO.  Without them, PayPal would be in a sea of ‚Äã‚Äãonline fraud and client claims. </li><li>  Sanjay Bhargava, a former employee of CitiBank.  He developed the world's first cheap way to identify bank accounts.  This was an extremely necessary factor for the continued operation of the PayPal business model. </li><li>  Jeremy Stoppelman (Jeremy Stoppelman), worked as vice president of the design department PayPal until the summer of 2003.  He went to Harvard Business School, and then became one of the founders of Yelp. </li></ul><br></div></div><br>  <b>4.</b> X.com (X) had more employees, user accounts, and a growth rate also exceeded Confinity‚Äôs similar figures (but it had more eBay users). <br><br>  <b>5.</b> Elon Musk was the CEO and Chairman of the Board of Directors of X / PayPal from January 1999 to October 2000. Just over half the life of the joint venture before it was agreed to sell to eBay in June 2002.  Musk was also on the board of directors during the entire existence of the company.  Elon managed the joint venture from April 2000 to October 2000, that is, 7 months.  It was a time when X.com/PayPal (it was called X until 2001) became the leader in the field of e-mail payments.  This was facilitated by a ‚Äúviral‚Äù growth model, a calculated business model, growth from 60 workers to several hundred, the emergence of a customer service and anti-fraud center, support for debit cards, support for a money market fund, and a foundation was laid for worldwide service and receiving various currencies. <br><br>  <b>6.</b> By the time Peter Thiel became CEO of X / PayPal (this happened at the end of October 2000), by and large, the company was already exactly what it is known today. <br><br>  <b>7.</b> When PayPal was sold to eBay, Elon Musk was its largest shareholder. <br><br>  Elon Musk says: ‚ÄúIt is worth saying that there is no significant hostility or rivalry between me and Peter Thiel and Max Levchin.  The only negative point was associated with a book called "The PayPal Wars", written by a flattering fool Eric Jackson.  Peter Thiel volunteered to sponsor him and helped with the publication of the book.  However, in defense of Peter, it can be said that he absolutely had no idea that the book would turn out so terrible.  He personally apologized to me at David Sachs' house. ‚Äù <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a62/982/29a/a6298229af7432ff956bae3e5e5a4ea7.jpg" width="600"><br>  <i>(in the photo: 2002, Peter Thiel and Max Levchin a few seconds after the end of the auction. The initial price of the shares is $ 13, the final price is $ 20. PayPal held the initial public offering for a month and a half before selling eBay)</i> <br><br><h4>  What now? </h4><br>  And Musk continues to think "what problems the world and humanity will have to solve in the future" and founds SpaceX (2002), Tesla Motors (2003), <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SolarCity">SolarCity</a> (2006) <br><blockquote> Host: - And you decided to create a space company.  How could you even think of such a thing? <br>  Elon Musk: - I am often asked this question.  And they often joke: ‚ÄúDid you hear about a peasant who made a small fortune on space technologies?  And he began with a large state. ‚Äù  I always answer that I wanted to find the fastest way to turn a large state into a small one. </blockquote><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/3ftghBr3haY%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700002,15700023,15700186,15700190,15700253,15700256&amp;usg=ALkJrhg2engyyYJbJTxZpxgep3UKZLTbrw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><blockquote>  I am convinced that there is a huge gap between the fascinating fate of mankind, which conquers space, explores the stars and planets, and the fate of humanity, which has imprisoned itself on Earth and is rushing to inevitable death. </blockquote><br><br> <a href="http://web-payment.ru/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b96/f2c/dbf/b96f2cdbf9ab40d2991b03650b7010b5.png"></a> <br><habracut></habracut></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/232005/">https://habr.com/ru/post/232005/</a></p>
