Know your goal</font> </h2><br>  The remaining steps described in the article will not be useful if you can not cope with the first of them.  Ask any person who is successful in their field, and he will tell you that he had a clear and concrete idea of ‚Äã‚Äãwhat he <a href="http://blog.mbaconsult.ru/blog/personal/kak-pereyti-ot-mechty-k-delu-4-shaga-k-motivatsii/">wants to achieve</a> . <br><blockquote>  ‚ÄúSetting goals is the first step towards making the invisible into tangible‚Äù - Tony Robbins </blockquote><br>  Let's say you want to learn a new language.  Imagine how you would feel if you were fluent in Spanish today. <br><ul><li>  What opportunities would you have fluency in this language? </li><li>  What would you do right now if you could speak without hesitation in Spanish? </li><li>  Would your relationship with family / friends be deeper?  Would you expand your business?  Would travel be more fun? </li></ul><br>  This exercise in visualization and goal setting triggers the production of dopamine in the brain, giving impetus and energy to move mountains.

      More importantly, it helps to understand why you want to master this particular skill or skill. <br>  Everyone, thanks to the huge amount of information available on the web, is able to figure out how and what.  But only you can understand your ‚ÄúWhy?‚Äù. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0071c5">2. Repeat the best</font> </h2><br><blockquote>  ‚ÄúGood artists copy.  Ingenious - they steal ‚Äù- Pablo Picasso </blockquote><br>  No matter what you want to learn or achieve, there is already someone in the world who has achieved a similar desire. <br>  In other words, it makes no sense to reinvent the wheel again.  As <a href="http://blog.mbaconsult.ru/blog/personal/obzor-seminara-toni-robbinsa-osvobodite-vnutrennyuyu-silu-den-1-prevrashchenie-strakha-v-silu/">Tony Robbins</a> said this: <br><blockquote>  ‚ÄúMany great leaders have proven that the fastest way to master any skill, strategy or problem solution is to copy the behavior of those who have already trodden this path.  If you find someone who has already achieved the results you need, and have taken the same actions as he, you can get a similar outcome. ‚Äù </blockquote><br>  Your age, gender or previous experience does not matter.  Repetition gives you the opportunity to speed up the realization of your dreams and achieve more in less time. <br><br>  In the information age, your teachers and trainers can take the form of biographies, books, videos, and knowledge that are abundantly available to those who are looking for. <br><br>  There are dozens of solutions, for example, Clarity to help entrepreneurs, CreativeLIVE for photographers or Rype for those who study languages. <br><br>  <b>Who seeks will always find!</b> <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0071c5">3. Immersion, immersion, immersion</font> </h2><br>  Remember how you learned to drive at the very beginning? <br><br>  When you first started off, you probably had thousands of thoughts in your mind (including how to break the car!). <br><br>  This is explained by the fact that you have not yet ‚Äúbecome involved‚Äù sufficiently.  But <a href="http://blog.mbaconsult.ru/blog/personal/chto-obshchego-mezhdu-upravleniem-kompaniey-i-gonochnoy-mashinoy/">when you are driving for the hundredth time</a> , you no longer think about the small details: how to light the headlights or how hard to press the brakes.  When performing such actions, you rely mainly on muscle memory. <br><br>  A study conducted among professional violinists supported the law of immersion and the rule of 10 thousand hours, distributed by Malcolm Gledwell.  The difference between a ‚Äúgood‚Äù and a ‚Äúprofessional‚Äù musician was 2000 hours (10 thousand versus 8 thousand). <br><br>  Although the rule of 10 thousand hours is still contested by several experts in the field of training, this does not affect the fact that immersion in the task at work during training is the only way to achieve mastery.  There are no shortcuts. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0071c5">4. Use live feedback</font> </h2><br>  Let's say we are going from Los Angeles to San Francisco, and I gave you the fastest car in the world (I don't really understand them ...). <br><br>  If you enter the wrong place from the highway without knowing it, the speed of your car will not matter.  In fact, in this situation, the possession of a more nimble machine will even become a significant drawback, because because of this you deviate from the course much more than anyone else.  This is one of the main costs that we face when learning anything. <br><br>  We are trying to learn everything by ourselves, not seeking to receive <a href="http://blog.mbaconsult.ru/blog/karera/kak-regulyarno-davat-fidbek-i-vse-zhe-vypolnyat-svoyu-rabotu/">feedback from those around</a> us, which can show us that we have gone astray.  I don‚Äôt know how many times I have watched businessmen who have failed only because they didn‚Äôt communicate with consumers and put the useless goods into production. <br><br>  As in the case of a high-speed machine, those who know how to learn quickly face the greatest danger.  Think about what else you might find out in the same time, if you weren't doing unnecessary things. <br><br>  It doesn't matter if you find a mentor or coach who has achieved what you dream about, or your grandmother who can look at you from the side.  Find this person as quickly as possible.  The speed of achieving success depends on the speed of the feedback loop. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0071c5">5. Discard what does not work</font> </h2><br>  Many of us know about the <a href="http://blog.mbaconsult.ru/blog/personal/tselesoobrazna-li-mnogozadachnost/">dangers of multitasking</a> , but we still continue to act in the same spirit.  The study showed that while doing several things at the same time, it takes 23 minutes and 15 seconds to achieve <a href="http://blog.mbaconsult.ru/blog/personal/21-sovet-pozvolyayushchiy-prevratitsya-v-samogo-produktivnogo-cheloveka/">full concentration</a> after distracting from the problem being solved. <br><br>  Because of this, many people work 9 hours a day and face a new hitch every 5 minutes.  Such is terrible statistics. <br>  Since multitasking is so ruthless, and our ability to concentrate is limited, the only way to maximize our own results is to abandon meaningless things. <br><br>  The easiest way to do this is to apply Pareto's law.  In almost everything we do, there are several vital elements that produce most of the desired results. <br><br>  For example: <br><ul><li>  <a href="http://blog.mbaconsult.ru/blog/personal/9-melochey-imeyushchikh-ogromnoe-znachenie-dlya-schastya/">80% of happiness</a> bring you 20% of people around you; </li><li>  80% of your income comes from 20% of classes; </li><li>  80% of knowledge you get from 20% of mentors, books or solutions. </li></ul><br>  Although the 80/20 ratio may vary depending on the situation, the principle is obvious.  Very few matters matter, and your task is to figure out which ones should be performed and which ones should be discarded. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0071c5">6. Be prepared for anything</font> </h2><br>  In his acclaimed autobiography, Arnold Schwarzenegger claims: successful people do only two things: <br><ul><li>  repetitions; </li><li>  measurement of "mileage". </li></ul><br>  We have already discussed the meaning of repetitions, but ‚Äúmileage‚Äù often turns out to be an even more important point.  If we could analyze the number of potential talents, enterprises, or innovations buried due to lack of perseverance, we would be shocked by the results. <br><br>  Regardless of the hard work or the size of the talent, comprehending anything, we move along the learning curve. <br>  For people who do not understand that ‚Äúfailure‚Äù is just a natural part of the learning process, it is very easy to lose motivation. <br><br>  In fact, ‚Äúfailure‚Äù - when the majority abandons their idea - it is just a stage before getting the greatest, breathtaking results. <br><br>  Do not discard your dreams only due to the fact that at the moment you are not getting the desired indicators. <br>  If you have an exact idea, the desire to conduct mass experiments and someone in the role of a lighthouse, then you are already half way to the goal! <br><br>  PS We recommend another article on the topic - <a href="http://blog.mbaconsult.ru/blog/personal/uroki-uspekha-i-produmannykh-resheniy/">Lessons from success and thoughtful solutions from Mozart, Picasso and Kobe Bryant</a> . <br><br>  Translated by Vyacheslav Davidenko, founder of <a href="http://www.mbaconsult.ru/">MBA Consult</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/304410/">https://habr.com/ru/post/304410/</a></p>
