  <section class="page js-page"><h1>New rating on free-lance.ru: real improvement or a desire to make money ?!</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Definitely, the impact of the upcoming financial crisis (and I think it has not reached its apogee yet) affects all networks more and more.  Popular resources, one after another, are headed for monetization, and this is often done under the guise of various kinds of improvements. <br><br>  "Classmates" will not mention.  About them, and so much has been said.  An example is the introduction of a <a href="http://www.free-lance.ru/help/%3Fid%3D56">new rating system</a> on the popular freelancing project - <a href="http://www.free-lance.ru/">free-lance.ru</a> .  Trying to understand all its intricacies, I didn‚Äôt come to the conclusion that the system was intentionally complicated in order to hide the main thing - the desire of the resource to earn more (by the way, the desire is quite adequate). <br><br>  Consider the situation in more detail.  Now, it turns out that the most significant factor influencing the rating of participants is what you would think ... A deal without risk! 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>
        <script>
          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      To understand what this is about, it is worth saying a few words about this very <a href="http://www.free-lance.ru/service/mediator/">Deal without risk</a> .  You, as a customer, enter into a contract with a freelancer and a resource.  The contract prescribes the terms of reference, approved by you and agreed with the freelancer, the timing, cost of the project and other details.  After the conclusion of the contract, you transfer the specified amount to the resource.  Upon successful completion of the project and receiving a signal from you, the resource transfers the agreed amount to the freelancer‚Äôs account.  Naturally, the resource for its services asks for a pretty penny, guaranteeing the security of the transaction and the objective consideration of claims in case of their occurrence. <br><br>  Obviously, a risk-free transaction is a completely positive phenomenon, if not for one ‚ÄúBut‚Äù.  In order to increase your rating (and this, naturally, every participant of the project aspires) you need to make more Transactions without risk.  That's it!  And until now it seemed to me that the most important in the rating should be customer reviews.  Who else but they determine the professional suitability of a freelancer. <br><br>  One might think that the resource is struggling with a reduction in the cases of the so-called ‚Äúscam‚Äù.  But how many of them.  Show statistics.  There are already a lot of mechanisms and mechanics of struggle with manifestations of this kind on the site. <br><br>  We will also not forget that according to the new rating system, the <b>amount of points you get for each Transaction conducted without risk directly depends on the budget of the transaction</b> and the estimates that the employer gives you at the end of your cooperation.  Noticed how the emphasis? <br><br>  Among other things, there is one more thing.  With the introduction of a new rating system, the value of the Transaction without risk has doubled, and now amounts to 10% of the project cost.  That is, under the project, at $ 1,000, the resource receives $ 100.  And no risk. <br><br>  We see a veiled desire to bite off a piece of fatty pie turnover transactions, made daily in freelancing and so far inaccessible to the owners of the site.  And so I want to touch the beautiful! <br><br>  Let's not forget that the latest improvements on freelance also include a <i>quiet</i> increase in the cost of a missile defense system (this is how professionals are supposedly noted on the site, although this is not always the case).  And also almost doubled. <br><br>  Well, the financial crisis is gaining momentum.  It's only the beginning. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/44723/">https://habr.com/ru/post/44723/</a></p>
