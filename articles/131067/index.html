Finally they made their representation! <br><br><h5>  <b>And so, let me introduce myself ...</b> </h5><br>  Young, free mail resource <a href="https://www.gypost.com/">gYpost.com</a> , which has its own view on the organization of e-mail, different from all others.  We are open from August 2011 and are in beta testing, i.e.  see us, comment. <br><br><h5>  <b>What we are not like everyone?</b> </h5><br>  At the heart of the development of <a href="https://www.gypost.com/">gYpost.com</a> is our disagreement with the fact that users do not have a choice when working with e-mail, since all e-mails are alike.  For the sake of justice, let's say about gmail.com, who nevertheless tried to change a bit the situation and brought a slight variety.

      And since resources are similar, they all share the same positive and negative sides. <br>  We tried to preserve the positive and eliminate the negative aspects, and came to the conclusion that not only a change in the technological base (technology, software, hardware) of the resource is required, but a change in the philosophy of the approach to organizing mail. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  In <a href="https://www.gypost.com/">gYpost.com</a> you do not use folders and sorting rules.  We offer you to look at the mail as if you are a one-on-one.  To do this, use the "Contacts" - special filters that call from your mailbox the necessary letters on the screen.  They are created automatically or on demand based on the email address or group of senders or recipients of letters.  Contacts are also a place to store information about your addressees, phones and notes. <br><br><h5>  <b>What does the interface look like?</b> </h5><br>  After a short registration, having entered your box, a panel appears in front of you on which the contacts you created are located.  Depending on the events in the mailbox, the contacts automatically change their location and thereby simplify the work process, since frequently used contacts are always in front of your eyes. <br><br>  Clicking on one of the contacts in front of you displays all correspondence relating to the selected contact.  It is systematized in the form of a dialogue, thus allowing you to keep abreast of the latest topics discussed. <br><br>  All contacts on the tape have their own image that can be changed and customized, which speeds up the visual search.  For this, the mail has an extensive gallery of pictures. <br><br>  When new letters arrive, they automatically get into the appropriate contacts, and a notification appears about it.  This approach eliminates the need to select letters from the heap of correspondence that you do not need at the moment, which is in the Inbox, as you often have to do using other mail resources. <br><br><img src="http://gypost.ua/images/other/1000.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The contact system simplifies the process of thematic systematization of correspondence and creates a user-to-user communication environment.  The advantage of such a construction is realized immediately, just enough to work with it and start communicating. <br><br><h5>  <b>We want to be comfortable</b> </h5><br>  The list of contact letters itself is organized in the form of correspondence, where the sent and received letters are placed together, placed in chronological order.  You can view and reply to several of the letters at once. <br><br>  We should also mention the function of creating a new letter.  When you create a new letter, you have full access to all correspondence - now there is no need to copy any elements of other letters to the buffer beforehand and only then go on to the process of creating a new letter, here you can view and use everything directly under the edited letter. <br><br><img src="http://gypost.ua/images/other/1001.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>Unique is the viewing of only one of the attached files in the letters of the contact.</b>  With a single mouse click, all attachments of the selected contact are displayed on the screen.  Pictures, photos, music, video, PDF files can be viewed directly in the mail without downloading to your computer. <br><br>  The service allows you to transfer your contacts as easily and simply as to transfer a regular file by letter.  If the addressee‚Äôs mailbox is also in the gYpost.com service, then when receiving a letter with an attached contact, the recipient will be able to add it to his contact tape, and for third-party services it will be transferred in VCF format.  During the transfer, the user chooses which information to transmit, and which not, thereby managing his private information. <br><br>  Since almost all modern users already have electronic mailboxes on other resources, the possibility of collecting correspondence from existing users' mailboxes is simply and clearly implemented in the mail.  This is done in an intuitive form and does not require special knowledge. <br><br>  It is possible to block the receipt of correspondence from the contact in your inbox.  This is convenient for the temporary suspension of receiving electronic mailings.  You can also configure the contact to automatically mark incoming messages as read by the user. <br><br>  In the interface there are still many great features that will be useful to you. <br><br><h5>  <b>About security.</b> </h5><br>  When developing mail, we understood that there are many different kinds of dangers in the network that can harm you personally (theft of bank data, addresses) and your data on personal computers.  For this reason, network security has not been overlooked. <br><br>  We work using SSL encryption certificates, which will not allow an attacker to get your personal information to access the box. <br><br>  All attachments in letters are anti-virus scan, both at boot and at reception. <br><br>  It provides for the protection of users from receiving SPAM, as well as its uncontrolled distribution. <br><br>  Emails are checked for potentially harmful content in the body of the email.  When viewing suspicious emails, the system automatically cuts off potentially dangerous items and provides only the safe part for viewing.  If you trust the sender, you can display the letter in its original form.  Well, or if you think that this is all ‚ÄúFrom Evil‚Äù, then you can choose the mode of permanent display of the original.  You have the right to decide what level of security you need. <br><br><h5>  <b>About user support.</b> </h5><br>  User support and awareness is one of the key features of our site.  For this reason, the contact with the support service was brought into a separate, easily visible contact.  Through it, you can receive answers to your questions regarding the work of the service, as well as transmit your feedback and comments. <br><br>  It should be noted that during the conduct of any modifications of the resource, you will receive a short letter about what has been improved or implemented.  This approach, in our opinion, raises the awareness of users already working in the system, and clearly shows that the improvements are aimed primarily not at attracting new users, but at improving the usability of existing users. <br><br><h5>  <b>In our plans ...</b> </h5><br>  We try to keep our pace and not relax, because we have to fight for a place under the sun.  In the near future we will have the transfer of large files and letter templates.  We are also working on preparing the site for the use of mail for corporate purposes.  The ability to access the box via the IMAP protocol is being configured and already being tested. <br><br>  We will be grateful for your constructive criticism, advice and we will be happy to answer your questions. <br><br>  Website: <a href="https://www.gypost.com/">gYpost.com</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/131067/">https://habr.com/ru/post/131067/</a></p>
