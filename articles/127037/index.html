      After a minute, together we come to the idea that it is really necessary that the site be used to make contact with the buyer.  And the ephemeral "position" is a very intermediate goal. <br><br>  To solve the main task - <b>to make the first contact with the customer as ‚Äúwarmer‚Äù as</b> possible in a lot of different ways. <br><br>  And we begin to draw the path that a person goes from issuing to making contact with the company.  It perfectly illustrates <b>all the disadvantages of using only search engine promotion</b> . <br><br>  I propose to follow this path and you. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  On Habrastorage I uploaded a slightly smaller picture, so I blurred a little. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/fcc107cf/2f0e0e8c/860033a1/8ca3025f.jpg"><br><br><h5>  1. Enter request, examine issuance </h5><br>  I already wrote on Habr√© in the article " <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/onlinepro/blog/112754/">How to clog the top</a> " about how to properly evaluate keywords and phrases from the point of view of promotion. <br><br>  In our case, I will only say that sometimes the user does not click on the links in the search results at all, but immediately enters another query. <br><br>  With regard to search engine promotion, you need to understand that a person‚Äôs desire to go to the site depends not only on position, but also: on the type of request, subject, cost of goods, when the user looks at the maximum of pages to choose the best offer, and most importantly - on the attractiveness of the site description in extradition <br><br>  Therefore, it may happen that the site in the 2nd or 3rd position will receive more visitors than the 1st. <br><br>  There is still necessary to note that now in the extradition to be the first is very difficult.  Not so much because of the algorithms, but because of the composition of the search results: contextual advertising, videos, images, maps, etc., which no one even the most brilliant optimizer will have any effect on. <br><br><h5>  2. Did I get there? </h5><br>  For example, the description of your site seemed attractive to a search engine user.  It follows the link.  But he also opens several other sites. <br><br>  In the first seconds, a person determines whether he has found what he needs and closes sites where he either did not immediately notice the necessary information, or found them difficult to read. <br><br>  This is also an exit point from your site.  It is important to immediately convince the person that he has gone where it should be.  If, on most key phrases, a visitor comes to your homepage, where they tell him how good your company is, it will never become a buyer. <br><br><h5>  3. And what are you better? </h5><br>  There are a few sites that really have the necessary information about the product / service. <br><br>  And at this moment a person begins to browse the site.  Here in the first seconds the visitor determines how difficult it will be for him to communicate with your website. <br><br>  Remember how much time you spent on sites where the text goes uninterrupted without paragraph breaks, and the compressed images are heaped? <br><br>  This is also an exit point from the site. <br><br>  Suppose that this stage has been passed, the selection of the conditions for working with the client begins. <br><br>  Undoubtedly, an important role is played by the offer price.  But it happens that there are no prices, but there is an inscription ‚Äúwe have the lowest prices and the most favorable conditions‚Äù.  Believe me, prices are low for everyone, and conditions are the best.  It is necessary not just to speak, but to prove.  If you can not specify the price, write about how it is formed and what it depends on. <br><br>  The price is more or less clear.  But you need to find the maximum profitable differences from your fellow competitors.  If, apart from the price, there are no differences, then you will never be the best in your niche. <br><br>  Short deadlines for delivery, commissioning, home specialist ... Only all the advantages must be proved and shown in figures, while remaining honest.  For example, delivery of equipment during the week, processing of the application in 15 minutes, etc. <br><br><h5>  4. Check for lice </h5><br>  The buyer is almost ready.  And here begins the most interesting.  The remaining companies are starting to check.  How much is written on the site is true?  Are there any reviews about you on the web, publications, information about participation in exhibitions and press portraits of employees? <br><br>  Creating a non-existent company website on the Internet is easy.  You can even make the resource very believable, but if nobody has ever seen you live, then there will be no information about your company on the Internet. <br><br>  Why am I doing this?  Moreover, if apart from search engines your site does not appear anywhere, then the credibility of the company will be appropriate. <br><br>  In the event that information about it appears in the media, magazines, blocks of contextual advertising, blogs, social networks and other popular resources - the attitude towards the company will be much more loyal. <br><br><h5>  5. Contact? </h5><br>  The visitor has chosen you.  I wrote a letter or dialed a phone number.  This is far from victory.  And not because the buyer is harmful.  He may not be answered in time for the letter, and the phone will be busy. <br><br>  To use technology, you need to be ready for this.  Therefore, it will not be possible to just pay someone money, and wait for millions in profits without doing anything yourself. <br><br>  The promotion specialist probably understands little in your business, and in this case your task is to act as a consultant for him, so that all project participants will eventually understand who should come to the site, what materials and in what form they should be presented, and what actions should make a potential buyer. <br><br>  <b>And there is also a web analytics, which often shows that the traffic from search engines is far from the highest quality.</b> <br><br>  But that's another story. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/127037/">https://habr.com/ru/post/127037/</a></p>
