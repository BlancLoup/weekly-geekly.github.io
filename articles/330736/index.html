  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Crazy Artificial Intelligence</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><p>  Why does everyone want to create sane artificial intelligence?  What if you go the other way, and try to create a crazy artificial intelligence?  Have you ever had such a thing when some <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259E%25D0%25B1%25D1%2581%25D0%25B5%25D1%2581%25D1%2581%25D0%25B8%25D1%258F">obsessive thought</a> didn‚Äôt give you rest all day, continually rising in your mind?  Or that you could not remember the word, although it was spinning in your tongue?  Or did you try to remember something, but nothing came of it?  A few days later, or even weeks, this information suddenly surfaced in the mind ... </p><a name="habracut"></a><br><p>  In this regard, we will make the assumption that, in fact, we do not control the mental process directly, but only send tasks for processing.  There are tasks, the answers to which are on the surface in quick access.  And there are tasks, the answers to which the brain has postponed somewhere further. </p><br><p>  Then the situation in which we cannot remember anything can be explained by the fact that the brain took the task for processing, did not find the answer in quick access, and put this task in the task queue with low priority.  The processing of a low priority job queue occurs in the background, and does not guarantee the execution of a task.  Or a situation where every thought in our mind emerges in the mind can be explained by the fact that the brain never stopped turning that thought in a cycle.  And sometimes this thought fell into our focus. </p><br><h2 id="za-delo">  For the cause! </h2><br><h4 id="slovar-terminov">  Glossary </h4><br><ul><li>  Dictionary - a set of unique words, obtained by analyzing any text; </li><li>  Mysleslovo - word from the dictionary; </li><li>  Thought image - the image originated in the imagination; </li><li>  Mental health - reactions to external stimuli: light, heat, sound, etc. </li><li>  A thought is a set of thought, thought and thought. </li><li>  Mental association - the connection between thoughts, images and thoughts, having weight; </li><li>  Thought-function - takes at the entrance thought-word, thought-image and thought-feeling, and causes thought-function; </li><li>  Thought suggestion is a chain of thoughts; </li><li>  Ether is a continuous stream of thought; </li></ul><br><h4 id="obuchenie-ii">  AI training </h4><br><p>  The dictionary is filled with thoughts by analyzing any text (the more text is analyzed, the better).  The following operations are performed during the analysis: </p><br><ul><li>  we take the first word from the text and add it to the dictionary; </li><li>  we associate this word with the following two (other variants are possible), putting weight for each new connection (the farther the next word is from the current word, the less weight), thus we got the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãassociation; </li><li>  the weight of thought-association increases each time a combination of words re-occurs in the text; </li></ul><br><p>  Let's analyze only the word, the thought, the ether and the thought function, which receives one word at the entrance.  The essence of the thought function is as follows: if we feed the thought function "bow" into the thought function, then in the process of processing the thought function, the thought function will select all thoughts that have thought associations with the word "bow", for example "green", "bulb", "weapon" , "vegetable", "bowstring", "arrow", etc.  Then she calls herself, sending at the entrance of thought the weight of the thought-association of which is greatest. </p><br><p>  It turns out that the thought-function generates a whole range of calls of thought-functions, sending another thought-word to the input, thus we received a chain of thoughts, i.e.  thought suggestion. <br>  This whole process goes on continuously, thereby creating the ether. </p><br><p>  Let us build a chain of three thought functions: At the entrance of the first we submit the thought "bow".  She, in turn, calls the second thought-function by giving her the word "bulb" to her input.  The second thought function causes the third one, sending the thought word ‚Äúvegetable‚Äù to it, etc. <br>  Thus, we get a chain of thought functions, and if we take all the thoughts of this chain, we get a mental proposal: "Onion Vegetable". </p><br><p>  Taking into account the fact that a person can keep, according to my observations, only one thought (for this a simple experiment was invented, during which it is necessary to list the alphabet, pronouncing a number after each letter, ie: A1 B2 B3 and t . e.), and we will present all other thoughts as a continuous stream (ether), from which we sometimes catch in focus one of the chains of thoughts (thought proposition). </p><br><p>  By changing the weights of thought associations we can influence the course of thoughts in thought suggestions.  This can be compared with when you are reading an article, and after reading it, you consider for a long time the thought that the author has shared with you.  Or you watched the movie, and then tell your friends about it.  Another example is when the weight changes in thought associations, this is the moment of meeting with a familiar person who promised you something, but you forgot about it, and now having seen him remember again. </p><br><h4 id="podytozhim">  Summarize </h4><br><p>  If we manage to create such an ether, then the stream of ideas in this ether will be similar to the thoughts of a crazy person who repeats the same thing.  One of the main tasks, the solution of which will need to be achieved, is the creation of the greatest length of thought proposals.  Then, "asking" the system for anything, it will respond to us with these ideas. </p></div>
