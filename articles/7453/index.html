At the same time, even those whom I previously considered an ideal and were ready to take an example from them suffer from this disease. <br><br>  The problem of growth, or rather the problem of transition from a small company, where each user is very valuable, to a large company, where there is no need to fight for each client, because  from them, and so there is no end, it is a disease that like a virus infects everyone. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  On the one hand, this disease can be easily dealt with by educating your staff and entering the correct work criteria.  And on the other hand, it is possible and not to fight, but to concede such customers to their competitors.

      It seems Yandex or have not yet understood that he has started such a disease, or is following the second way, considering that he simply does not have time to do this and does not have worthy competitors. <br><br>  Two examples on this topic: <br>  1. Twirled in the directive ad for two words: ua-ix and search.  The content is as follows: Search in Ukraine - Ukrainian search engine with the ability to search in ua-ix. <br>  I decided to add one more word uaix, because  people sometimes gain it in that way.  In response, my ad was removed from the reason: "Keywords do not correspond to the subject of the ad."  Where is the logic, I did not understand. <br>  2. A couple of months ago I applied for a direct affiliate program.  Rejected with the wording - the content of the site does not comply with the rules.  In this case, my suggestion to indicate what exactly the moderator did not like so that I could fix it, I was not answered. <br><br>  In the first case, Yandex refused the money that I already paid him. <br>  In the second he gave an advertising platform to more than 7 thousand Ukrainian users per day to his competitor - Google, where they didn‚Äôt see any problems and normally pay us for $ 400 per month. <br><br>  Perhaps, on the scale of Yandex‚Äôs profits, this is a drop in the ocean, but if it continues this way, then because of poorly trained support, with its inadequate actions and complete lack of feedback, Google has a great chance to create strong competition for them. <br><br>  I wonder why in the few years of working with Google I have never had any problems at all?  What, they did not have the same disease and everything is waiting for me ahead?  :) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/7453/">https://habr.com/ru/post/7453/</a></p>
