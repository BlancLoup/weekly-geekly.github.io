  <section class="page js-page"><h1>SDN: alternative or addition to traditional networks?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  <i>Modern information technologies place increasing demands on the flexibility and scalability of computer networks.</i>  <i>As expected, software-configured networks will help solve a number of existing problems, will contribute to the creation of automated, programmable, flexible and cost-effective network infrastructures, but the SDN strategies of leading vendors differ markedly.</i>  <i>A good example is Cisco and HP approaches.</i> <br><br>  Gartner estimates that network infrastructure accounts for approximately 17% of the IT budget.  However, it is not always able to adapt to the changing needs of the business.  New trends - virtualization, cloud computing, user mobility, traffic growth - are changing the requirements for network infrastructures.  Will the network products being installed today be able to provide support for future applications and services?  To what extent will the development of the network be tied to the products of the selected switchboard manufacturer? <br><br>  The propriety of the solutions, the architecture of traditional network equipment, makes this binding very strong.  Some even describe the current situation in the network industry as revolutionary.  A number of experts call the transition to the software-configured (software-controlled) network architecture (Software-Defined Networking, SDN) as a recipe for eliminating the problems revealed in the networks.  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/muk/blog/251959/">SDN</a> promises to significantly reduce the dependence of customers on the technology of a particular vendor.

     <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/hp/blog/255363/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/07a/519/682/07a5196825984889920d0274433cd7dc.png"></a> <br>  <i><font color="#999">In SDN, the entire control logic of network devices is placed in the so-called ‚Äúcontrol plane‚Äù, which is implemented programmatically.</font></i>  <i><font color="#999">Structurally, controllers can be built either on the basis of physical or virtual hosts.</font></i>  <i><font color="#999">Network devices are usually controlled by the OpenFlow protocol.</font></i> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The main idea of ‚Äã‚ÄãSDN is to separate the traffic transfer functions from the control functions.  In traditional switches and routers, these processes are inseparable from each other.  In SDN, a network consisting of multiple devices from different manufacturers appears to the application as one logical switch.  SDN allows administrators to program the network as a unit, rather than engage in individual switches that can simply follow controller instructions. <br><br>  The implementation of this concept greatly simplifies the operation of the network, its configuration.  Switches can be simple and cheap.  Characteristics of the network can be quickly changed in real time, reducing the time to introduce new applications and services.  Controller's programming interfaces (APIs) allow developers to create network management applications.  Such applications can perform a variety of functions, and it does not require to know the features of the specific network devices. <br><br>  It would seem that such an approach should not cause enthusiasm among network equipment manufacturers, who have been improving the unique functions of their switches and routers for many years, because the ability to use simple and cheap switches and create applications by third-party developers using open APIs undermines the business of these companies and deprives them of their added value .  However, large customers, including leading telecom operators and providers, are already imbued with the ideas of SDN, and chip makers for switches have announced support for OpenFlow, so vendors cannot stand aside. <br><br>  Now even a company that does not have many years of experience in using network technologies can create its own switch operating under the OpenFlow protocol.  The Open Network Foundation (ONF), which unites supporters of ‚Äúopen networks‚Äù based on the OpenFlow protocol, includes an increasing number of network market players.  The business of Cisco and other traditional switch manufacturers may be at risk.  According to experts, the widespread adoption of SDN can more than double the turnover of the network giant. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/1ac/b8d/19d/1acb8d19d6df4e0a8120dcd21a082ae0.png"><br>  <i><font color="#999">According to the Infonetics Research survey (July, 2014), 87% of medium and large enterprises plan to launch SDN in their data centers by 2016.</font></i> <br><br>  In any case, SDN will substantially override the network market, radically change the approach to the design, deployment and management of networks, to the delivery of applications and services.  Traditional network vendors treat SDN differently.  However, such large network market players as Cisco and HP formed the main elements of their software-configured strategy several years ago. <br><br>  In 2012, it was reported that Cisco Systems could launch proprietary network products that implement the SDN concept, but do not necessarily use OpenFlow.  At the same time, HP announced support for the standard OpenFlow protocol in many of its products.  The industry talked about the fact that in SDN these companies took fundamentally different ways, one - proprietary, the other - based on open standards.  HP executives did not fail to note that open standards and compatibility with other vendors' equipment remain the basis of the company's approach, and the proprietary path is not in the interests of customers. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0096d6">HP SDN</font> </h2><br>  In fact, HP showed a switch with OpenFlow support at the ACM SIGCOMM conference back in 2008.  In 2012, HP Networking introduced nine new HP 3800 switch models that implement the OpenFlow protocol.  Later, a complete software suite came out with its own SDN controller from HP and programming interfaces (APIs) that allow developers to create applications for SDN. <br><br>  Currently, almost the entire line of HP switches and routers supports the OpenFlow protocol and can work both in traditional networks, when network traffic management is implemented on each device, and in software-configured networks managed by an HP controller. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e0e/03e/a05/e0e03ea052d84f5e9dc7527986535690.png"><br>  <i><font color="#999">HP Virtual Application Networks SDN Controller</font></i> <br><br>  HP Virtual Application Networks SDN Controller was introduced in 2013 as software and as a turnkey solution based on the HP ProLiant server.  The controller can be installed on a normal (or virtual) server, or on a cluster of servers for a more productive and fault-tolerant solution.  It implements the standard functionality of dynamic configuration of network devices based on specified rules, interacting with SDN infrastructure components using the OpenFlow protocol. <br><br>  The controller supports a number of built-in functions, including network virtualization, security, and traffic management, as well as authorization and authentication mechanisms for access control of SDN integrated tools and external applications.  To interact with the latter, a RESTful interface is proposed that can be used by various orchestration and management systems, as well as business applications. <br><br>  HP OpenFlow protocol is considered one of the important, but not the only components for building a fully functional <a href="http://h17007.www1.hp.com/us/en/networking/solutions/technology/sdn/index.aspx">SDN infrastructure</a> .  In addition, other mechanisms for dynamic device configuration are also considered components of SDN, for example, NETCONF, OVSDB.  Along with the standardization of the interaction of the management level with the network infrastructure (the so-called "south bridge"), there is a need to standardize its interaction with applications (the so-called "north bridge").  This is implemented on the basis of technology REpresentational State Transfer (REST).  In addition, the question of the interaction of SDN controllers from different manufacturers remains important.  So far, only a small number of independent vendors are taking steps to ensure the interaction of their decisions.  One <a href="http://h17007.www1.hp.com/us/en/networking/solutions/technology/sdn/index.aspx">example</a> is the integration of the HP SDN controller and VMware NSX. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0096d6">SDN applications</font> </h2><br>  A number of applications have already been created on HP's SDN controller platform.  Some of them are developed by HP, for example, Net Optimizer, Net Protector.  Others are created by HP partner companies and an open community.  Such applications allow you to create an integrated SDN environment, including applications adapted to interact with the network environment via an SDN controller, the SDN controller itself, and the network infrastructure supporting the OpenFlow protocol.  This creates a basis for automating dynamic network management processes for application requests on the fly, which increases the efficiency and flexibility of using infrastructure resources, and also reduces the total cost of ownership. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0096d6">SDN strategy</font> </h2><br>  HP emphasizes the company's commitment to developing open network solutions that help to better unleash business application capabilities and now prepare the infrastructure for full-scale use of SDN technology at minimal cost.  The main objective of the SDN strategy in the company is considered to be the complex (end-to-end) network automation - from data centers to campuses and company branches.  Therefore, the HP SDN solution is not limited to data center networks - it also covers branch and global networks, where you also have to deal with the difficult tasks of flexible resource management. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/8df/2d0/eec/8df2d0eec0e04a44bc2c3aa88f9dcd9b.jpg"><br>  <i><font color="#999">Released in mid-2014, the HP 5400R zl2 series switches are a new generation of equipment designed to help customers increase network infrastructure performance and switch to flexible SDN technology.</font></i> <br><br>  HP recommends that customers now prepare for the implementation of SDN and purchase network equipment with support for SDN technology, create test zones to verify the compatibility of the infrastructure with applications.  Tested solutions can be gradually deployed across an enterprise network.  If an enterprise starts to introduce technologies of software-configured networks now, in a couple of years it will be able to deploy a full-fledged SDN infrastructure with all its advantages in terms of flexibility and increased business efficiency.  Ultimately, an increase in the number of available applications will lead to a large-scale deployment of SDN in the enterprise network.  According to IDC forecast, the <a href="http://www.astera.ru/news/%3Fid%3D108221">market for network applications</a> SDN by 2017 will reach $ 1.1 billion. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0096d6">SDN App Store</font> </h2><br>  Last year, a project was launched on the <b><a href="https://hpn.hpwsportal.com/catalog.html">HP SDN AppStore</a></b> electronic platform for the corporate segment.  In its assortment - various applications that solve a wide range of tasks from ensuring security to supporting cloud computing and mobility, as well as access to the means of their development.  The list of applications is constantly expanding due to the active work of partner companies and the Internet community.  The most popular are virtual network controllers, applications for optimizing traffic when running unified communications based on Microsoft Lync, as well as SDN SDKs. <br>  In addition, HP offers various forms of training for application developers. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b57/e97/b2a/b57e97b2a0f44e1ca8517ebe6e2d560a.png"><br>  <i><font color="#999">At the end of last year, HP opened an online supermarket for SDN applications.</font></i>  <i><font color="#999">Developers can submit their SDN solutions there, and customers can choose the most profitable and convenient network application for themselves.</font></i> <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0096d6">Cisco ACI</font> </h2><br>  In November 2013, Cisco Systems executives demonstrated the concept of software management of a complex network infrastructure developed by Cisco, Insieme, focused on optimizing application performance and having approximately the same goals as SDN.  It was called Application Centric Infrastructure (ACI).  The ACI includes an APIC (Application Policy Infrastructure Controller) controller, Nexus 9000 series switches and an enhanced version of the NX-OS operating system.  For the Nexus 9000 in ACI mode, Cisco ASIC chips are used. <br><br>  ACI is often seen as an SDN variant with proprietary components, such as the Nexus 9000 switches. The ACI creation demonstrates Cisco's desire to use the leading position in the networking industry to counter its own development with the proliferation of standard SDN technologies.  However, no one vendor can completely ignore these technologies today.  It is therefore not surprising that in the so-called offline mode, these switches support SDN functionality and the OpenFlow protocol. <br><br>  What is the difference with Cisco?  Like SDN, ACI provides software control, but not simple switches, but still complex and multifunctional network devices, play the role of managed elements.  The main idea of ‚Äã‚ÄãACI is to give applications the ability to program the network "for themselves."  To do this, create an Application Network Profile (ANP), which specifies the parameters of quality of service (QoS), security, load balancing, etc. These profiles are loaded into the APIC controller, and that one - programs Cisco switches.  Profiles are used to configure the network and apply management policies.  The APIC controller is an essential component of ACI, controlling physical and virtual network devices using ANP.  According to the developers, ACI should help customers unlock the full potential of their applications and increase business agility. <br><br>  ACI is very similar to SDN, but Cisco emphasizes that APIC is not an SDN controller.  It operates independently of the switching data level and control level, without separating the relevant processes.  Its most important functions are infrastructure management and informing higher-level systems about its status (monitoring). <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0096d6">Integration Opportunities and Partner Ecosystem</font> </h2><br>  Currently, Cisco Systems continues to promote ACI as an alternative to SDN.  A year ago, the company introduced the ‚Äústandards-based‚Äù OpFlex protocol, which should play the same role as OpenFlow.  The corporation is even counting on using the IETF to make this protocol an industry standard.  For the time being, ACI requires new switches (Nexus 9000 series) and new software (Application Policy Infrastructure Controller, APIC), although it is possible to integrate with various means of orchestration and automation. <br><br>  For the interaction of ACI with management and orchestration platforms such as OpenStack, Puppet, CFEngine, and others, the XML, JSON, and RESTful APIs are used.  They must also integrate ACI with the SDN OpenDaylight open platform, Open Source virtual switches and VXLAN technology.  To support and develop a new infrastructure, Cisco builds an ecosystem of partners.  The Cisco ACI initiative is supported by BMC, Computer Associates, Citrix, EMC, Emulex, F5, IBM, Microsoft, NetApp, VMware, and several other companies. <br><br>  However, ACI is a proprietary alternative solution that limits customers to a closed supplier ecosystem.  For some companies this may be an acceptable option, but goes against the general market trends. <br><br>  Meanwhile, Cisco is trying to maintain the market position of its equipment, offering for them some kind of additional shell, and calling it SDN.  In particular, SDN support, added in 2013 in the Cisco Open Network Environment (ONE) and in Cisco OnePK (Platform Kit), allows them to be seen as tools designed to help a company protect its position in a key market.  This initially provides the best results when working with Cisco devices, that is, focused on its own products, and does not provide the kind of openness that SDN requires. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0096d6">Road to sdn</font> </h2><br>  In the end, <a href="http://philipcao.com/2014/07/28/2014-gartner-magic-quadrant-for-data-center-networking/">analysts believe</a> that an open SDN solution is considered more promising.  At the moment, SDN already provides companies with a variety of options to choose from: switches with OpenFlow, NETCONF, OVSDB support and an expanding API library, as well as enterprise software that takes advantage of these protocols.  Like any other, SDN infrastructure should be based on open standards.  Such an open ecosystem will accelerate the process of introducing innovations in the field of network technologies. <br><br>  Although due to the inertia of thinking and the negative impact of crisis phenomena, the traditional approach to building network infrastructure dominates, SDN already now allows you to effectively solve problems at the junction of virtual and physical environments.  The experience of large Internet companies has demonstrated the ability to adapt a large-scale network infrastructure to constantly changing requirements.  But most companies are not in a hurry with implementing the SDN strategy, believing that they will have to completely change their network equipment. <br><br>  Some of these concerns stem from the common misconception that SDN is a product.  In fact, it is rather an approach to network design, as well as a new paradigm of their administration, monitoring and, ultimately, adaptation to business tasks implemented by applications.  The transition to SDN is a phased process that takes into account business scenarios for network usage.  Although there are certain products, for example, SDN switches with OpenFlow support, there is no need to completely replace the network infrastructure. <br><br>  According to forecasts, in Europe and the United States mass introduction of SDN will begin in 2016.  By this time, the global market for SDN may exceed, according to IDC, $ 3.7 billion.  About 670 million dollars will come from SDN applications.  As the pace of implementation grows, tools and capabilities will also develop.  SDN as a technology has reached a critical mass, and for those companies that prefer to use it, there are now many different options. <br><br>  In Russia, an active interest in software-configured networks will begin somewhat later, but today a number of Russian customers are discussing pilot projects with SDN, <a href="https://sk.ru/news/b/news/archive/2015/02/24/rostelekom-issleduet-tehnologii-sdn-i-nfv-pri-pomoschi-cpiks.aspx">research is</a> being <a href="https://sk.ru/news/b/news/archive/2015/02/24/rostelekom-issleduet-tehnologii-sdn-i-nfv-pri-pomoschi-cpiks.aspx">conducted</a> , the <a href="http://www.cnews.ru/top/2014/11/05/sozdan_pervyy_rossiyskiy_sdnkontroller_589401">first Russian SDN controller has been created</a> .  As expected, software-configurable networks based on open standards will bring the network infrastructure in line with business needs and budgets.  In addition, the client will not be tied to any particular vendor, so it will be able to implement technologies from different manufacturers. <br><br>  Our previous publications: <br><br>  <font color="#0096d6">¬ª</font> <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/hp/blog/254645/">New network architectures: open or closed solutions?</a> <br>  <font color="#0096d6">¬ª</font> <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/hp/blog/252857/">Implementing MSA in a virtualized enterprise environment</a> <br>  <font color="#0096d6">¬ª</font> <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/hp/blog/252149/">HP MSA Disk Arrays as a Basis for Data Consolidation</a> <br>  <font color="#0096d6">¬ª</font> <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/hp/blog/251567/">Multivendor corporate network: myths and reality</a> <br>  <font color="#0096d6">¬ª</font> <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/hp/blog/249913/">Available HP ProLiant server models (10 and 100 series)</a> <br>  <font color="#0096d6">¬ª</font> <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/hp/blog/251023/">Convergence based on HP Networking.</a>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/hp/blog/251023/">Part 1</a> <br>  <font color="#0096d6">¬ª</font> <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/hp/blog/248047/">HP ProLiant ML350 Gen9 - server with insane extensibility</a> <br><br>  Thank you for your attention, we are ready to answer your questions in the comments. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/255363/">https://habr.com/ru/post/255363/</a></p>
