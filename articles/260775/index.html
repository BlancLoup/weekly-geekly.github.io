Yes, and was not going to promote.  I just did not find which other Habr or Megamind can be published in this article.  Just tell the story.  I'll try shorter. <br><br>  Once upon a time I bought several books teaching work in 3dsmax 6 and read them.  And most of all the knowledge I was given a book, built on the principle of "we do practical exercises and along the way we deal with the program."  Unlike the rest, dryly telling about all the functions of 3dsmax without practical examples. <br><br>  When, at the beginning of this year, I sat down at the course on Akshur, I decided to go in two ways at once and took up two products.  The first one was a set of videos for all Akshurny functions, and the second one showed how in 5 hours I made a prototype of an online store from scratch.  Fortunately, I‚Äôve forgotten the first one (fortunately, because the eighth version of the program is on the way, it‚Äôs better to take it), and the second one is done. <a name="habracut"></a>

      How did the recording.  I just sat down for the usual work, but this time I did it not in silence, but commenting on my actions on the microphone standing on the table (the price of the question is 10k, I got it from a friend).  I took the project as a basis, which I completed literally one month before the start of the recording: the online store of printers and cartridges (it was hp).  Of course, I greatly simplified it for the course.  I captured the screen using a program called <a href="https://www.techsmith.com/camtasia.html">Camtasia</a> . <br><br>  After about seven hours of recording, stretching for a week, the five-hour course was ready.  There was a question how to sell?  Here you can write a lot of text about searches and experiments, but I will limit myself to the description of the final setup: a platform for publishing knowhow <a href="http://knowhow.ru/">info products</a> (5k per month for use) in conjunction with <a href="http://payu.ru/">PayU</a> payment gate.  The contract was concluded with those and others.  White money should have been credited to the account.  And, in fact, come. <br><br>  Then I went to my <a href="https://vk.com/axure">group on Akshura in contact</a> , which at that time was slightly less than 4k participants and said in one of the posts: ‚ÄúThe people, the course that you were ready to buy, according to previous polls, is ready!  Fly! ‚ÄùWell, of course, I formulated it in a different way.  And that brought me zero sales.  I announced the course a couple of times, including in the <a href="https://vk.com/projectorat">Public Protorate</a> , with the same result.  Issue price - 5 000 rubles.  Those wishing to purchase - no one.  It turned out to make two sales manually through friends who knew me and, in principle, were waiting for this course. <br><br>  The page selling the course looked <a href="https://knowhow.ru/catalog/rgh/33873/">terrible</a> at the time of the first attempts, but I didn‚Äôt plan to convince those who constantly ask me questions about Akshur in personal messages that it is worth their attention.  And in vain. <br><br>  As a result, I had to do a <a href="http://imaxure7.projectorat.ru/">landing</a> .  For this I used <a href="http://tilda.cc/ru/">Tilda</a> .  There was a separate story with Tilda, worthy of her article.  Everything ended well, and for an hour and a half of my work, the selling page of the course flaunted on the third-level domain of the Project City.  Landing was even a review that I received from one of the first buyers.  In order not to make special selling commercials, I just laid out the first and twelfth lessons in open access.  And it began to work!  And it brought me more ... two sales.  At this time, buyers formed from <a href="http://youtube.com/ekamelev">my channel on YouTube</a> . <br><br>  In parallel with these cases, I occasionally talked with familiar info-businessmen who laughed at my stupid sales "head on" (comparing them with scattering potatoes across Nevsky in the hope that it would sprout) and shared the science of how to sell info products.  In a nutshell: first, we sell something super cheap or free, then we gather an audience on a couple of webinars, organize a subscription to the newsletters, sell something more expensive and at the very end, when everything is already warm and informed, we roll out a full-fledged course.  And, most importantly, you do not need to sell it as a ‚ÄúPrototyping Course in Akshur‚Äù.  You need to sell as "A course that will teach you skills with which you can earn a lot of money on freelancing."  In general, the info-business from me did not work, because  I knew for sure that out of those people who complete the course, there would be few people earning something on freelancing, and then this will not be connected with what I teach.  This knowledge prevented me. <br><br>  In the end, I gave advertising in the contact and direct.  The contact accepted my announcement from the seventh attempt.  Moreover, the seventh version of the announcement is identical to the fifth version, which they refused to show.  At first I didn‚Äôt like the image (in the end I just inserted a photo of my physiognomy), then the wording.  As a result, only the advertisement remains from the advertisement.  I showed it in those groups where UX-designers were found, the audience was about 15k people.  The recommended transfer price was about forty rubles.  Therefore, I leaked the first 2.5k rubles for a couple of hours, until I decided to try to reduce the recommended price to 20 rubles, then to 10 rubles, and now the advertisement is running at 3 rubles per click.  The effectiveness of coverage and impressions fell, but not an order of magnitude, in contrast to the price.  Advertising in Kontakte brought me 3 more buyers, respectively, the money for it was repulsed with interest. <br><br>  About Direct I really have nothing to say.  The budget of 1000 rubles for a set of key phrases, the authors of which may be interested in prototyping in the seventh Akshur, is spent for a week with great difficulty. <br><br>  Total: for all the time I made 7 sales (but I don‚Äôt intend to stop there) and I barely beat off the hours I spent on creating the course itself.  But it is already clear how and what to launch the next course. <br><br><h2>  Summary </h2><br>  First, I, as a novice seller of my own product in electronic form, faced with the fact that I did not understand what services to use, what to do and how to sell.  And an active search in Yandex and Google did not lead me to any team that could take me with my product and send me on the right path for referral or subscription fees.  Now I can easily find both services and teams, but only because I upgraded from a completely newbie to someone who is a bit in the subject.  From here: a niche for help to novice info-businessmen is not yet very good at working with the target audience.  Everyone is interested in existing authors. <br><br>  Secondly, it is easier to sell now not applied materials for one or another profession, but a profession entirely under the sauce of personal gain from this profession.  Everyone asks about a full-fledged course on interface design, but few will be interested in details and particulars: how to speed up work in a specialized software or what business processes are used by one or another established market experts.  There are cardboard characters, yuzkeys and Cooper with Raskin.  But the formalization of functional requirements or how to write TK will be of interest to the units that have already smelled gunpowder.  And this is logical.  And I have a lesson for the future. <br><br>  Thirdly, the very fact of creating something autonomous for sale, and then selling it, gave me a new experience and emotions.  I was also able to compare the sales of information products with the sales of design services (this is what I do in life) and understand which pieces to borrow. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/260775/">https://habr.com/ru/post/260775/</a></p>
