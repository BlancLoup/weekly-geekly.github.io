And then my mind transferred me three years ago, when we and our team first heard about this technological project competition and thought: ‚ÄúWhy not?  Why not try it! ‚ÄùAnd today I thought the same thing:‚Äú Why not?  Why not try and write an article about how we walked long and hard to the final of the Imagine Cup. ‚Äù <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  But before starting my story, I would like to thank Microsoft for the opportunity and the organization of such a great technology competition.  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/shwars/" class="user_link">shwars</a> and Anya Grechishkina for help and helpful advice.  Mail company, for the provided site.  As well as psychologists and our leadership for the continued support. <br><br><h5>  Team and background. </h5><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/6f8/6d3/8c9/6f86d38c9f67d8ba05bf248938aadb57.jpg"><br><br>  The composition of our team is quite simple, two harsh programmers and a creative designer.  We have traveled quite a long way in order to develop into a strong and cohesive team.  In 2011, we first heard about the competition of software projects, even visited the regional finals in Tomsk and then decided for ourselves that next year we will also implement our first project. <br>  Since 2011, we have been actively engaged in the development of various projects and managed to participate in a large number of competitions and grants, where we were noted.  Our main projects are:

    <ul><li>  <b>PDP</b> is a desktop application that allows you to conduct an information security audit in enterprises.  It was the first project with which we went to ImCup 2012 in Tomsk and took 3rd place there. </li><li>  <b>ScanFood</b> is an application for Windows Phone 7/8, which with the help of a camera reads the barcode of a product and determines the degree of its harmfulness.  This project has received approval in local and regional competitions. </li><li>  <b>Not Alone</b> is an application for Windows Phone and Windows 8, whose task was to acquaint people with their interests by organizing meetings.  It was a FUN project and we went to ImCup 2013 with him. </li><li>  <b>KaTrIna</b> is again a mobile application, the main function of which is to monitor the public activity of teenagers in social networks (Vkontakte, Twitter, Odnoklassniki, Facebook, etc.) and mobile notification of parents about the suicidal activity of their children.  This application will be discussed in this article. </li></ul><br><br>  If anyone is interested in reading how we were preparing for the very first software project competition for us, we didn‚Äôt sleep at night and how not to do it, I attach a link to <a href="http://x3m-mors.blogspot.ru/2012_03_01_archive.html">my blog</a> . <br><br><h5>  Project "KaTrIna": History.  Relevance.  How it works. </h5><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/44d/7b5/3e6/44d7b53e6573baf88f6edd322a585bf8.jpg"><br><br>  How strange the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãsuch a project arose when viewing ‚ÄúLet They Speak‚Äù at 4 am in the month of November.  And since we had no other ideas, we began to actively collect all the necessary information in order to make sure that the topic is really relevant, and such a problem exists in the world.  After two months of active communication with psychologists, searches on the Internet, etc.  we were convinced that the topic is really relevant in the fact that in the modern world the indicator of suicidal activity is growing more and more each year. <br><br>  Now in more detail about what we wanted to do.  We decided to implement a mobile application, because  The main goal was to instantly notify parents of the suicidal activity of children in social networks.  Since  we are a Microsoft Student Partner and we are boiling in the same pot with the technologies of Microsoft, we decided to develop for Windows Phone 7/8, but in the future we will focus on the cross-platform nature of our application. <br><br>  So, what makes our application: <b>‚ÄúKaTrIna‚Äù</b> constantly parses (tracks) the social networks of adolescents, namely, public information on the presence of words and statements related to suicidal activity and instantly notifies parents of this.  You ask: ‚Äú <i>Why would the child write about it in public?</i>  "The psychologists answer is simple:" <i>Children just want to be noticed and heard!</i>  "And in the modern world, the contact between the parent and the child is very weak, because  parents are busy making money, and children are spending more and more time on social networks and thus moving away from their parents. <br>  To implement this application used the ability to immediately three powerful platforms: <br><br><ul><li>  Windows Phone 7/8 </li><li>  Windows 8 </li><li>  Windows Azure </li></ul><br>  We started the implementation with the ‚ÄúIn Contact‚Äù API, since  in Russia, this more common social network among adolescents.  Quickly enough, we connected the API, learned how to unload the ‚Äúnegative posts‚Äù we needed (Everything was tested on ourselves), we drew the design and logo.  We did not invent anything global and simply decided, with the help of psychologists, to compile a thesaurus of words and phrases that a teenager could write.  It was for this thesaurus that the posts were analyzed and if similar words were found, a push notification came instantly to the parent of the child. <br><br><h5>  Shortly before the Russian final of the Imagine Cup 2014. </h5><br>  In March, we went to the regional stage of the Imagine Cup 2014 and this is what we had on the project by that time: <br><br><ul><li>  Connected API of the social network "V Kontakte"; </li><li>  Implemented prototype with basic functional requirements; </li><li>  Connected cloud service to the application. </li><li>  Raised version control system. </li></ul><br><br>  And despite the fact that we took 2nd place, our project was evaluated and invited to the Russian final ( <i><u>Yes, our three-year dream has come true, now you can tick this item in notebook!</u></i> ) <br>  Now we had 2-3 weeks of active work on the project (we even had to leave the main work for a while), because  we wanted to show the maximum functionality of our application.  Plus, the <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/shwars/" class="user_link">shwars</a> advised us to add the ability to assess the mood of the child and build graphics, how it changes.  Due to lack of time, we searched through the mountain of ready-made algorithms of the so-called sentimental analysis and found the right one - AlchemyAPI.  He helped us with the definition of the text in three groups: negative, positive and neutral.  With the help of them we can already build graphs of the mood of the child.  In addition to all this, we wanted to make the most clear and interesting presentation, so we were engaged in shooting a small video clip.  And just in time for the flight, we managed to do everything that was in our power. <br><br><h5>  The final?! </h5><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/fd5/e23/81b/fd5e2381ba0a8712e107b3abcf8545e3.jpg"><br><br>  I will say one thing, the final was organized at the highest level!  Yes, we did not take prizes in Moscow, but we were not upset, because  Our project has gained even greater support and interest from some organizations in our city.  Also, we found people who are interested in this project and want to help us in the development.  We have received several proposals for a more global implementation of this application, and we are certainly pleased.  Thank you Microsoft!  And of course I want to wish good luck to all our guys who will compete for a trip to Seattle! <br><br>  <b>See you at the Imagine Cup 2015!</b> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/221735/">https://habr.com/ru/post/221735/</a></p>
