  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Transformation or profanation: how to "digitize" communication operators</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  ‚ÄúDigit‚Äù goes to telecom, and telecom goes to ‚Äúdigit‚Äù.  The world is on the verge of a fourth industrial revolution, and the Russian government is conducting a large-scale digitalization of the country.  Telecom has to survive in conditions of radical changes in work and in the interests of clients and partners.  Growing competition from representatives of new technologies.  We offer a look at the vector of digital transformation and pay attention to internal resources for the development of business of telecom operators. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><h3>  IT power </h3><br><br>  The telecom industry is under the vigilant control of the state and is constantly regulated, so it‚Äôs difficult to talk about the digital transformation of telecom operators without reference to similar trends within the country.  The introduction of the ‚Äúfigures‚Äù at the state level is one of the government‚Äôs priority tasks, ranging from transformational work in all areas to the national program ‚ÄúDigital Economy‚Äù.  The latter is designed for six years and includes: <br><ul><li>  5G network development; </li><li>  development of a communication network development scheme; </li><li>  certification, data center classification and definition of requirements for infrastructure; </li><li>  creation of an IoT regulation system; </li><li>  create processing standards big data; </li><li>  the introduction of a single cloud platform; </li><li>  cyber security enhancement. </li></ul><br>  By the end of the program, 100% of medical, educational and military facilities will become broadband subscribers, and Russia will increase storage and processing data by five times.

Federal agencies are starting to maintain cloud-based centralized accounting.  The Central Bank has outlined a strategy for developing financial technologies through the Open API and the creation of digital platforms. <br><br><img src="https://www.garant.ru/files/8/8/1179988/pict4-71773130.png" alt="image"><br><br>  The government tightly tackled the country's digital transformation, extending it to <a href="http://government.ru/news/34821/">transport complexes</a> , <a href="http://government.ru/news/35192/">entrepreneurship</a> , <a href="http://government.ru/activities/selection/301/36339/">insurance</a> , <a href="https://fss.ru/ru/fund/disabilitylist/index.shtml">medicine</a> and other areas.  In 2020, they will introduce <a href="https://russian.rt.com/russia/article/605667-gibdd-elektronnye-prava">electronic driver's license</a> , in 2024 - <a href="http://static.government.ru/media/files/3b1AsVA1v3VziZip5VzAY8RTcLEbdCct.pdf">electronic passports.</a>  Russia already has a high level of e-government development index, and Moscow took the first place in the ranking in 2018.  Russia's global digital transformation is no longer an empty sound.  I believe that the requirements for the modernization and digitalization of enterprises will soon be enshrined at the legislative level.  This will also affect the telecom - both the industry and the business as a whole. <br><br><h3>  Global Trends </h3><br><br>  State understanding of digital transformation corresponds to what this term implies the global community.  Back in 2016, it was <a href="http://blog.dp.ru/post/9332/">predicted</a> that 40% of companies would not survive the digital revolution if they did not accept the new rules of the game.  Automation of business processes and electronic document management - only the necessary minimum for competitive struggle.  The main components of the digital-transformation business according to users: <br><br><ol><li>  Artificial Intelligence; </li><li>  Cloud services; </li><li>  Internet of Things; </li><li>  Processing big data; </li><li>  Use 5G; </li><li>  Investments in data centers; </li><li>  Information Security; </li><li>  Modernization and improvement of infrastructure; </li><li>  Changes in corporate culture and company strategy; </li><li>  Open to partnership and create collaborative products or services. </li></ol><br><br>  The first digital transformation will affect the retail, manufacturing, financial sector and IT.  But it will affect all industries and areas of business, and this is a chance to benefit from the new requirements. <br><br><h3>  Growth points for telecom </h3><br><br><h4>  Ott <br></h4><br>  The first steps to the fourth industrial revolution are able to solve the sore problems that telecom operators face.  For example, the heightened struggle with OTT-providers that capture the market. <br><br><img src="https://araund.ru/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/181aa69323335a688c4da72a05893589.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  TV users increasingly prefer watching movies and TV shows at a convenient time, and a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/intl/ru/yt/about/press/">third of Internet users</a> view content on YouTube.  A variety of entertainment, educational, and informational videos attracts an audience, bringing more and more profits to OTT players.  The growth rate of the subscriber base of pay-TV decreases every year. <br><br>  The growth of the subscriber by technology, 2018/2017: <br><br><img src="https://novostel.ru/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/d0b4d0bed185d0bed0b4d18b-d0bfd0bbd0b0d182d0bdd0bed0b3d0be-d182d0b2-d180d0b0d181d182d183d182-d0b7d0b0-d181d187d0b5d182-d0bfd0bed0b2d18b-2.png" alt="image"><br><br>  A winning option in such a situation would be the openness of the infrastructure and the company to the partnership.  Conclusion of contracts with OTT-providers will allow you to stop being a mediator and become an active participant in the process.  There are many options for arrangements - from bonus and discount programs to the organization of higher network bandwidth.  The adaptability and optimization of infrastructure play a key role here.  It is worth keeping in sight and opinion leaders of the young audience - video bloggers.  Collaboration with trendsetters that generate video content can become a gold mine. <br><br><h4>  Big data </h4><br><br>  Telecom operators process huge amounts of data, and it‚Äôs a sin not to monetize your experience.  In the era of digital transformation, the ability to work with big data determines the quality of interaction with users and partners, helps to personalize offers and increase advertising conversion.  The collection and analysis of information is important for the B2B segment, and the demand of corporate clients for these services is growing. <br><br><h4>  Iot </h4><br><br>  Market dynamics has been showing steady growth for five years. <br><br><img src="https://iot.ru/upload/medialibrary/5ae/5ae487ff9ee6817feb2d283dd775f5ee.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  M2M communication is a promising development for telecom.  The main requirements for cellular communication between devices: minimal traffic latency, special radio technologies and the same open infrastructure to create an ecosystem with developers and software platforms.  Part of the business will have to be restructured for the specifics of machine maintenance, including the development of new communication modes. <br><br><h4>  Data centers </h4><br><br>  Digital transformation is carried out not only by managing customer relations and internal automation, but also by building new business models.  Such a model for telecom operators could be investing in data centers and providing cloud services to customers. <br><br><img src="http://www.iksmedia.ru/data/2018/11/06/1237487936/iks1.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Big Data is continuously processed by B2B companies, and production capacity is not always sufficient for the smooth operation of servers.  Cloud technologies save space and money for customers, so more and more services and software are being developed in this format. <br><br><img src="https://www.itrn.ru/etc/images/691/ef1004ebcaa109ec716bc2c627120f85.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h4>  Infrastructure and partnership </h4><br><br>  Telecom operators will be at the junction of digital innovations and familiar tools.  In order to adapt to the new scheme of work, it is necessary to optimize the infrastructure with an emphasis on openness and be ready to cooperate with representatives of breakthrough technologies.  A modernized infrastructure is easier to monetize - an additional source of income could be the creation of MVNE and partnership with virtual operators.  And automation of work with resellers will reduce labor costs, increase control and loyalty of partners, which has a positive effect on building up the base. <br><br><h4>  Small, but remote </h4><br><br>  Not all of these growth points are suitable for startups and small players in the telecommunications market.  Meanwhile, the ‚Äúentrance‚Äù to the industry has ceased to be overwhelmingly expensive, including precisely due to cloud services.  Rented IT facilities, billing and software will be much cheaper, and their own aging technologies do not pull newcomers "to the bottom".  It is easier to start, but ideas and ambitions are more than enough.  Innovators are ready to ‚Äúride‚Äù the wave of digital transformation and immediately focus on, for example, the Internet of things, video content or affiliate programs. <br><br><h3>  Internal transformation </h3><br><br>  ‚ÄúDigital‚Äù is being introduced into the internal business processes of the company. <br><ul><li>  Processing your own data arrays gives a complete picture of the subscriber‚Äôs life and interests, allowing you to customize advertising campaigns with maximum conversion and create offers that will satisfy the specific needs of the user.  It is important to organize the scalability of systems to ensure the collection and analysis of big data 24/7 in the context of business development. </li><li>  The introduction of IoT and Artificial Intelligence in the work will eliminate the human factor and replace employees performing routine operations.  The number of errors and the cost of maintaining the state will decrease. </li><li>  Cloud technology is useful to use in their needs for server uploading and financial savings. </li><li>  <a href="https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/solutions/service-provider/visual-networking-index-vni/index.html">According to forecasts</a> , by 2021, 20 zettabytes of data per year will be processed on the global Internet.  This amount of information needs to be protected, and cybersecurity comes to the fore in the era of digital transformation.  Protection is organized at the <a href="http://duma.gov.ru/news/44551/">legislative level</a> .  I advise you not to neglect the protection from fraudsters and theft of subscribers' data and use adapted for modern software threats. </li></ul><br><h3>  ‚ÄúCurrent problems require modern solutions‚Äù </h3><br>  Digital transformation will occur in the state, and entrepreneurship, and thinking.  The ability to quickly adapt to changes guarantees the company leadership and the preservation of market share.  This ability is required of telecom and the government, developing work standards and registers of the equipment used.  Saving of conservative views and ignoring the approximation of Industry 4.0 may threaten the takeover of a company, bankruptcy, or an outflow of subscribers. <br><br>  As banks and fixed-line operators recently went to MVNO, so telecom operators now need to go to IT.  Virtually all the innovations of the digital transformation of telecom can be used to optimize their resources and create new sources of income.  The development vector should be aimed at working together with partners, developers and even competitors, as well as at controlling changes in the interests of customers and pinpointing their needs. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/452844/">https://habr.com/ru/post/452844/</a></p>
