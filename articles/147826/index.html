      Everyone knows that in Mexico there is a very big gap between the rich and the poor.  People are actually exploited in factories and pay them pennies for it.  So: these people accepted the challenge and made perhaps the most decisive choice in their lives. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  <b>Rigoberto Ortego</b> , a cheerful 30-year-old Mexican who speaks English without accent.  At the age of 12, he and his two brothers fled from Mexico to the USA at night through the desert.  One of them was pulled up by a coyote (I didn‚Äôt understand exactly what kind of animal it was, but most likely it was a coyote), the other could not stand the 7-hour jog and ‚Äúfell behind‚Äù. <br><br>  Now Rigo receives $ 3,400 per month and is the manager of a kosher product shop.  His life has changed for the better, he has a family and children.  However, he was able to take that step, which is not easy to make. <br><br>  <b>Michael</b> , when you see this man, the first thing that comes to mind is mafia.  The whole body is covered with scars and tattoos, many of them are reduced to a cigarette.  As he told me, he was in a gang, and they did a lot of bad things.  According to him, otherwise - not to earn. <br><br>  But he wanted a quiet life and family.  He had to escape from the gang, all the scars - this is a "gift" from his former friends.  Tattoos he personally drove himself to part with the past. <br><br>  He is now the owner of a local Mexican food home restaurant, and believe me, he loves his business. <br><br>  <b>Pablo</b> is perhaps the most difficult choice that a man who loves his family made.  He works in a kosher food store.  Such a kind and hard-working man of 60 years.  He worked always when I saw him. <br><br>  His wife had an accident and became disabled, while he had two children.  He found a way to raise his children and give them the best.  At the age of 27, he left illegally in the United States and began to work.  He sends almost his entire salary to his wife and children in Mexico. <br><br>  It has been 33 years since the accident, and he continues to send money to his wife and children from month to month.  And while he sleeps on bags of vegetables, holding in his hand a photograph of his wife.  He found a way to save them, not the easiest, but he found him. <br><br>  At the same time, I saw typical Americans who complain about ‚Äúbad work‚Äù and simply refuse to work, and sit down on unemployment benefits.  They do not want to change their lives, they do not strive for anything.  And this is really scary. <br><br>  I often see on Habr√© articles / questions that are published by people who believe in themselves.  They want to change their lives for the better, this is good. <br><br>  You have to go through a difficult path full of doubts, but you have to do it.  You have to go to your dream, no matter what others tell you.  And remember: "There is always a choice!" </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/147826/">https://habr.com/ru/post/147826/</a></p>
