We have this happened more than once. <br><br>  <b>Instead of the prologue.</b>  Moreover, in a sense, our profession is to sort out difficult situations.  Because for the last 7 years, my colleagues and I have been training IT specialists and managers in people management skills and what are called soft skills.

      During the work we have accumulated a certain number of tools with which we solve different management cases.  And these tools we have conceived to share. <br><br>  Firstly, because the tools are useful.  Secondly, I want to collect them all in one place, then to send everyone there.  Thirdly, we clearly understand that we are limited by our own context, and we will be very grateful if you will complement us.  Fourth, we do not really believe in advertising.  We believe in simple things - that if we do something useful for people, people will recommend us.  Why not write some useful articles? <br><br>  All the tools we will write about are very simple.  Either these are 2 by 2 matrices, or 4 questions, or something like that.  Since we work a lot with managers, we found that some managers are quite difficult to perceive the 3 by 3 matrix (hey, we were the managers ourselves, we know what we are talking about :)), and 2 by 2 is just fine, they go great. <br><br>  We came up with some tools, some borrowed from other smart people, some do not know where we came from in our head.  But they are all helpful, yes. <br><br>  Are these tools silver bullets?  It is clear, no.  But they definitely help to clarify the situation, distribute distributions and understand which way to think.  And you still have to come up with solutions.  Until finally the directory of young marmots appears on management. <br><br>  So, quite unnecessary words, let's move on to the first tool (in total, we plan to make out about 15 different useful concepts): <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h4>  Matrix of awareness and competence </h4><br>  This 2 by 2 matrix shows: <br><ul><li>  How does an adult learn any skill? </li><li>  Where the roots of some work conflicts grow </li><li>  How to convey your point of view, when you alone feel that your opponent is wrong </li><li>  What to do if you explain something to a person, but he still does not agree and / or does not understand </li></ul><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a4d/a4f/df9/a4da4fdf9b2b0a8210d3a17eb8019f26.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Imagine you hired a student with no work experience, but seemingly intelligent.  And now you give him the task to design the architecture of a module of your system.  ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not a question what to do there?‚Äù The student says and leaves.  In which square of the matrix is ‚Äã‚Äãit located? <br><br>  Perhaps, square A. There is no work experience for a person, he is only superficially familiar with your system, whether he did tasks of a similar type - most likely not.  At the same time, his phrase ‚ÄúWhat is there to do‚Äù suggests that a person does not understand the whole depth of the task before him.  And this condition is called: <br><br>  <b>A. Unconscious incompetence.</b>  The man is trying to do something, he does not work.  The architecture turns out to be bad, it cannot withstand the load, is not extensible at all, does not comply with the principles of SOLID and what else happens with architectures? <br><br>  What does the student think at this moment?  If he is more insistent than self-reflective, then he thinks: ‚ÄúI will try again‚Äù.  For the fifth time, when it failed again, the student begins to suspect something.  What probably humanity has already gained some knowledge about the architecture, because a specific representative of humanity Vasya from the neighboring department gets quickly and the first time. <br><br>  At this moment, the person mysteriously moves to the state: <br><br>  <b>B. Conscious incompetence.</b>  In this state, the person in the head appears the very necessary question, ‚ÄúHow?‚Äù And he goes to Google, to a seminar or conference, buys books, puts beer to a more experienced colleague.  And sooner or later (if a person is a student, of course), he manages to make his first successful architecture.  And this means that he has moved to the state: <br><br>  <b>C. Conscious competence.</b>  Do you drive?  Remember how you first set off on it.  Not stalled, namely, moved.  Most likely, you controlled each of your actions: <br><ul><li>  Turn on left turn signal </li><li>  Look at the mirror </li><li>  Buckle up! </li><li>  Damn, handbrake! </li><li>  Listen to the instructor mumbling </li><li>  Gradually release one pedal while pressing the other. </li></ul><br>  Oh miracle, a ton of metal moved from its place!  Before that she stood, and from here she moved - mysticism! <br><br>  When you can do something right, but do it slowly and controlling your every step is a state of conscious competence. <br><br>  if you continue to practice the skill, over time you will move to the state: <br><br>  <b>D. Unconscious competence.</b>  If an experienced driver in the middle of the road is patted on the shoulder and clarified: ‚ÄúPlease tell me now why you are driving in 3rd gear and in 2nd band,‚Äù he will sometimes get scared: ‚ÄúWho is here?‚Äù And will not always be able to explain. <br><br>  He drives a car on the machine (internal machine, not on the automatic box).  Skill fully automated.  so much so that a person can easily do something else while driving. <br><br>  Where do working conflicts come from?  Some working conflicts can be explained just by this matrix. <br><br>  At one of our reports, an experienced uncle (about 45 years old) got up and shared his situation: <br><br><blockquote>  I am the main architect in the company.  A student brings me his architecture.  I look at her and see that she is bad.  But I already forgot why.  How can I explain to a student that he is wrong? </blockquote><br>  If there are no facts, but you want to convince a person, then ‚Äúauthority‚Äù, ‚Äúbest practices‚Äù and other corporate ships that plow are used: <br><br><blockquote>  I have SEVEN YEARS OF EXPERIENCE in creating architectures, I tell you.  that she is a curve!  What's not clear? </blockquote><br>  What does a young student think at this moment?  Something like this: <br><br><blockquote>  Mdaaa, obviously, age ... Ours already completely broke away from reality ... </blockquote><br>  The chief architect is also dissatisfied with the student: why are they not listening to me, although I am so experienced? .. <br><br>  A natural question arises: <br><br>  <b>What to do?</b>  The answer is not as simple as it may seem.  Obviously, an experienced architect needs to either return to square C himself or find a person who can explain with the facts about architecture. <br><br>  And besides, the student needs to be raised to the level of awareness.  Either by letting him fill up the lumps, or by sending in to good training, or using simple techniques, such as testing a solution for stability [1].  But for the latter, you still need to remember the facts. <br><br>  <b>Question to think about.</b>  What do you think, in which squares are people coming to any training? <br><br>  This is an interesting point, because in the next article in a couple of days we just wanted to talk about the David Kolb model on how to build training for our colleagues. <br><br>  Alexander Orlov <br>  Stratoplan.Ru <br><br>  PS Friends, if you think that the idea with articles about such tools is worthwhile and useful, then somehow mark it.  For us, this will be a clear sign that we must continue. <br><br>  PPS If you have your own example, when there have been conflicts explained by this matrix - share and tell us how you managed to resolve the situation.  Your experience will be uniquely interesting to other members of the community. <br><br>  - Since I am writing on Habr√© for the first time, I have not figured out how to use footnotes yet.  So be it: <br><br>  [1] <a href="http://www.stratoplan.ru/blog/lib/solution-stability/">A. Orlov's article ‚ÄúWhat will happen if ... or How to help the other person give birth to the right decision‚Äù</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/198870/">https://habr.com/ru/post/198870/</a></p>
