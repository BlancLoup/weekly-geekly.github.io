  <section class="page js-page"><h1>-90% piracy on iOS or Hackulos closes</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Good day. <br><br>  Most iOS users having made themselves a jailbreak besides the ability to put different beautiful themes and features like tweaks also get the opportunity to install paid apps for themselves absolutely free. <br>  For this, a whole range of applications worked, closely related to each other. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h4>  Hackulos </h4><br>  This was possible thanks to Hackulos.us, who released the package which, in my opinion, should be installed almost first of all (for fans of freebies naturally): AppSync <br>  He allowed to install hacked applications and also synchronize them with Tuna.

      The second key thing the mobile pirate needed was Installous.  It allowed to search, download and install these hacked applications without any unnecessary manipulations and difficulties of transferring the program from the computer to the device and installing them through the console on the device.  Of course, it was possible to use applications like iFunBox, but this also required unnecessary gestures. <br><br>  By itself, Installous was the bridge between AppSync and another Hackulous project: AppTrackr.org - it was here that all the programs were laid out and from here they were downloaded.  The service was extremely convenient: as well as Installous, it could search, download (pick up a piece of bread from the developers), show the description, version and list of changes, but was a bit more convenient because it was an Internet service. <br><br>  This scheme worked like a clock, but one day it was all over ... <br><br><h4>  the end </h4><br>  Quite suddenly, Hackulous decided to cover up the shop on December 30, 2012, thereby putting the piracy of iOS apps on her knees. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/9de/622/fa0/9de622fa03b2ff0f6359ae4bb8190358.png"><br><h6>  Here is the message you can see on the main page of the blog Hackulous. </h6><br>  In short, there it is reported that the forum began to receive much fewer visitors and it is difficult to maintain the rest of the mess in the previous state by the administration of the resource. <br>  From now on, AppTrackr does not open, Installous when exiting too politely asks to exit (without options). <br><br>  This is how three projects immediately died: AppSync, Installous, AppTrackr.  And of course, after such losses, piracy will decrease significantly. <br><br><h4>  Why 90%? </h4><br>  Hackulous was leading in maintaining piracy at the proper level, but not the only one.  There are still all the other third-party app stores. <br>  Also, together with the projects themselves, their repository also died, but deleting it does not mean that you need to instantly remove AppSync and Installous, they can also be installed. <br><br>  Although this grand fiasco for all lovers of freebies will be a reason to think about shopping in the AppStore, for others it may be ‚ÄúChallange accepted‚Äù and the great community of freeloaders + jailbreakers will once again take up the level of piracy to its former heights. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/164771/">https://habr.com/ru/post/164771/</a></p>
