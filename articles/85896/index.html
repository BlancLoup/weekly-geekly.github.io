This is when you put rubles on a card, and you can pay in dollars, pounds, euros, eNah, whatever, your money is converted at an internal rate of Visa / MC, which is often more profitable than the rate of the Central Bank, which becomes a double advantage, namely: it is necessary to change the currency + it is a bit more profitable. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/9c1/965/315/9c19653159a5af91273feb8cc5fe7470.jpg" alt="image">  a very interesting and web-based payment service, most foreign websites are friends with him, but we are going to buy eBay, which accepts PayPal - first of all, and here we are very lucky, since it is 5 minutes to screw your card to PayPal, lucky for those whose card from Sberbank with the Mobile Bank service * (do not confuse with the client-bank, it will not be needed).  I can‚Äôt say anything about cards opened in other banks, there is no experience, and rumors are such rumors ...

      A couple of steps to meet the American dream, an example with Visa Classic from Sberbank: <br>  When you sign up for PayPal, for quick and easy payments with eBay, you need to attach a card to your PayPal account, namely: under your name in the account you will have the <i>status:</i> <u>Unchecked</u> , you need to turn it into <u>Verified</u> by clicking on it, PayPal will show you the scheme , for checking it will remove $ 1.95 from your card and send a <s>magic</s> code, you can agree, since the money will be returned to you in a couple of days, exactly $ 1.95, but when they withdraw, they will attach a code to the operation name that will be included in the sms message from Mobile Bank This is a service from a bank that writes  along with the name of the addressee, the address and number of the transfer, the amount in rubles, the balance on the card, something else, here in the name of the transfer there will be a treasured, four-digit code.  (if sms / email do not come to you at all, you can call the bank by phone and retrieve the information, breaking the code word of the telco operators) <br><br>  Enter the code on the PayPal website and your status becomes <u>Verified</u> , what does it mean? <br>  So this is that your card is now directly linked to PayPal, your cash transactions will be carried out directly with the card, with a minimum commission and without further confirmation, i.e.  quickly and openly for you, PayPal will record everything that happens with its participation, you can pay for purchases and delivery from the US in a couple of minutes. After you confirm the card with PayPal, you don‚Äôt even have to leave eBay when you confirm payment, everything is automated: get sms save time and money. <br>  By the way, about savings, omitting theses: cool, fashionable, modern;  perhaps simply, give an example of your shopping: <br><br><ul><li>  <a href="http://shop.ebay.com/360236744876">Movado</a> watches for my beloved, in Europe $ 390 at Msk $ 590 in my city isn‚Äôt at all, bought for $ 243 (including delivery) </li><li>  The <a href="http://shop.ebay.com/280465681213">Belkin</a> laminated leather case was purchased in the UK along with shipping for 757r., New;  in the cheapest place in Russia - digital.ru, it is 990 rubles.  no delivery and no stock, but like everywhere else. </li><li>  <a href="http://shop.ebay.com/290406562213">Apple In-Ear</a> Headphones, were purchased in the UK for $ 60.22, new, along with shipping;  in Russia, new, 4-5 tons.;  there, by the way, is still there. </li></ul><br>  Pondering over: saved up to 50% of the cost in Russia (including delivery), received: profit, pleasure from a simple and reliable process. <br><br>  Finally, I would like to highlight a couple of important nuances: make sure that the shipment of goods is round-the-world (Worldwide) or taking into account Europe, in case the seller does not send the necessary goods to Russia, you will have to contact an intermediary company, it‚Äôs just as easy via the Internet, here‚Äôs <a href="http://www.bay.ru/">one of the verified suppliers</a> , he will take the parcel to the USA (for example) and send it to you here for a reasonable fee. <br>  And one more thing: before buying something in the USA, check out the <a href="http://www.ebay.co.uk/">British eBay platform</a> , shipping from England is much cheaper. <br><br>  Happy bidding, username! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/85896/">https://habr.com/ru/post/85896/</a></p>
