  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Domestic software - the key to the development of intellectual production in Russia?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  It is known that in Russia non-primary production is developed rather weakly.  Manufacturers of intellectual products for a long time had to endure a high level of piracy, industrial espionage, and illegal borrowing of developments.  The share of foreign software used in Russia is 67%, and in hardware it reaches 90%.  Taking into account all these factors, the ordinary man in the street with great skepticism perceives claims that import substitution in the IT industry is waiting for at least some success.  It is said that this will be a ‚Äúsubstitution on paper‚Äù, without significant actual results.  Let's see if this is true and whether it is possible to reduce the use of foreign software to a minimum. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/GctvKc46ZP4%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700023,15700186,15700191,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhgwWidXJ7S0dq6fy7Jgh9CWMGvemQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  The first thing you can pay attention to is the new legislation protecting rights of holders.  Pirate sites are blocked, prices due to the increased number of licensed users have become quite affordable for the average consumer, and many Russian home users have already decided to use only licensed software on their computers.  Those.  the movement comes from two sides - from the state and from the owners.  This is the only way to break the mentality of Russian users who are accustomed to using products that ‚Äúcannot be touched‚Äù for free.

    <a name="habracut"></a>  The Russian software industry has made a significant leap over the past few years, this is one of the fastest growing industries in Russia.  In particular, in 2010 and 2011, the growth rate of Russian IT exports was 20%, in 2012 ‚Äî 17%, and in 2013 ‚Äî 15%, reaching $ 5.2 billion. IT exports exceed 0, 9% of all Russian exports, and the share of Russian software companies in the world software market is about 2.5%.  The volume of this industry is already compared with the volume of products manufactured by the military-industrial complex of our country. <br>  If we talk about the corporate software market, the majority of enterprises now use licensed software due to control from law enforcement agencies. <br><br>  Software increasingly contains a cloud component, i.e.  Some of the functionality is provided directly on the manufacturers' servers.  Products without a cloud component lose in their capabilities. <br><br>  Antivirus programs and solutions to control the traffic of the enterprise are now acquired first.  These classes of software are tied to the need to obtain constant updates of the bases of malicious code, and in recent years they cannot function normally without being connected to cloud detection databases that are updated in real time. <br><br>  The consumer understands that the software performs its functions properly - it is better to purchase it.  The operating system is better to buy in order to be able to receive new functionality and install updates related to information security.  Video games are worth buying, in time to install patches and have access to official technical support, and get pleasure from games, and not sit on the forums, trying to solve another problem. <br><br>  Those.  it is clear that the Russian software market is growing.  But who will benefit from the new federal policy aimed at import substitution? <br>  It is clear that the first type of beneficiaries are domestic software makers.  But what is beneficial to our software vendors is also beneficial to our country as a whole.  Taxes remain in our country, and this affects the quality of life of people through existing government social programs. <br><br>  Russian software developers respond faster to changing our local reality.  Programs do not need to adapt to our standards and production processes, our paperwork.  The chain from producer to consumer is shorter - it means that domestic software products easily compete with foreign ones for the price.  So, the second beneficiary is domestic users.  Again, domestic programmers are initially oriented towards the Russian-speaking audience, instructions are being developed in Russian, and there is Russian-language technical support. <br><br>  The third party that wins is our state.  There are cases when foreign software often contained bookmarks that allow special services of other states to gain unauthorized access to information located on users' computers.  At the same time, procedures for analyzing software code for the presence of bookmarks currently exist, but they are rather complicated to implement and unreliable.  Under these conditions, the use of domestic software is one of the echelons of protection against potential and real external enemies. <br><br>  The domestic software market has a great future, because  he is actually already formed, he is mature and ready to scale.  Of course, it will be difficult to replace foreign operating systems such as OS X or Windows, although with the proper organization of the process, you can use the existing achievements and use the opportunities offered by free software.  With proper address funding, you can solve such complex problems.  It is worth noting that there is already progress in creating a Russian operating system.  We can recall the OS MAWS, which has been used in the Ministry of Defense since 2002.  Among the free projects supported by enthusiasts, it is possible to note ReactOS, the development of which is largely concentrated at present in Russia.  The developers received state award grants and looked with hope at the new Russian policy in the field of import substitution. <br><br>  In hardware, such growth is much more difficult to provide, but even here nothing is impossible if you look at the experience of China, where individual hardware manufacturers have already reached the first places in the volume of the relevant markets in the world.  In particular, recalls the achievements of the Chinese (initially) company Lenovo, which managed to take fourth place in the top five of the world's largest manufacturers of personal computers. <br><br>  But it is impossible not to mention about the success of Russia in this field.  In particular, the Russian company MCST has been developing Elbrus processors since 1992.  Initially, these processors were produced in Taiwan, but at present production is being transferred to Russia.  Computers and servers based on these processors are being adopted by Russian government agencies.  The Omsk hosting service provider, Promobit, in August 2014 introduced the Bitblaze Rus storage server, running the Elbrus 2C + processor. <br><br>  In the field of mobile "iron" are also under development.  The Defense Ministry is currently using special mobile phones M-633C ‚ÄúBumblebee‚Äù, which allow working in GSM networks in both open mode and voice encryption mode.  In 2013, similar devices began to be used also by the Arsenal plant of Roskosmos due to an increase in leakage of secret information.  Uses such phones and the Federal Penitentiary Service. <br>  In general, it can be concluded that intellectual production in Russia can and should be developed, it can and should be done not only by necessity, in response to sanctions from other states, but also without such sad incentives and occasions.  Of course, this will require considerable effort, for example, in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãcontrol of targeted spending.  Of course, the substitution will not be 100%, and, in general, it is not necessary.  But it is necessary to use the factor of the increased state interest in the transition from foreign high-tech products to domestic ones, this factor will positively affect the growth of the Russian IT industry, and therefore the economy of our country as a whole. <br><br>  The article was prepared by the developers of the Traffic Inspector software solution. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/235291/">https://habr.com/ru/post/235291/</a></p>
