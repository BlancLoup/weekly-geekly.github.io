I continue to talk about the letters in the blog of Michael, the owner of Textbroker. <br><br>  Suppose you have an online store, and inside it has a product card.  And the goods come in two heavy categories: <br><ul><li>  Those with dofiga non-unique text (for example, phone specifications, instructions for medical products), and it is not clear how to deal with SEO. </li><li>  Those who have the articles #### 0001, #### 0002, #### 0003 ... #### 0050, and so on, that is, they are distinguished by some completely unrealistic trivialities like color.  Example - 180 models of charming panties.  Unfortunately, they are adorable for a √©iter only the first ten times. </li></ul><br>  Let's see what to do. <a name="habracut"></a>

    <h4>  Common text with other sites </h4><br>  From technical characteristics to two sheets of any technology can not escape.  They need to be brought, and more often - without changes, or with small explanations, what exactly each feature of the product means. <br><br>  My favorite example of refinement is the technical characteristics of Lytro cameras.  There, among other things, is mentioned <i>‚ÄúResolution: 40 megaylips‚Äù</i> .  This is exactly the place where you need to explain who this uncle megaluch is.  Because usually in this place marketers showed megapixels.  And there are no megapixels, but there are these funny little animals.  And the animals, horror of horrors, are not directly converted into points.  Megapixels, alas, will be only about four, and not forty pieces - and the buyer can come to frantic delight ahead of time. <br><br>  Do I need to bring this hefty block of text from hundreds of other sites?  Need to.  Remember, the task of the search engine is not to find the most unique page in the world, but to find the most useful for the user.  So get to the point with your head, imagine that you yourself - the buyer.  And everything will turn out. <br><br>  Naturally, the recipe for a normal card has been around for a long time - you need not only to give TTX, but also to play with the device.  And write a review.  So that the actual practical experience was much more than the characteristics. <br><br><h4>  Product Assortment </h4><br>  Articles with differences in color should be combined into one card with a choice of models.  Similarly, in size.  If the site's engine does not support such tricks, then you just need to insert an HTML dash with a selection into the description itself.  Top and bottom descriptions of models.  And yes, give the same description with the changing first paragraph. <br><br>  For products that differ slightly, you can use the following principles: <br><ul><li>  If this is an old and new model, for example, reissue without changes - swap their URIs so that people keep coming to the current one.  In the same place, leave a description from the previous one with minor corrections.  For an old model on a new address, write a new short description indicating that it was an old kind of garbage, differing in something that has now been discontinued. </li><li>  A line of similar products, for example, dozens of almost identical radio-controlled machines and helicopters, is described simply.  Structure: a paragraph about what it is in general, a paragraph about differences from other products of the line, exact TTX, a paragraph of the brief history of the unit of equipment being modeled.  If there are absolutely incredibly many of them, then one general description is written that describes each and every product of the line (optimally, in the form of a FAQ).  And a paragraph is hung on top of it on each page, which specifies exactly what it is and how it differs from everything at once.  In general, as Aristotle taught - ‚ÄúDefinitio per genus proximum and differentiam specificam‚Äù - listen to the peasant, he devoted his whole life to separating concepts. </li><li>  The line of building materials or other strange things is hell from the point of view of the text.  Only photo stories and a good classifier are saved here, which is better (and what exactly). </li><li>  If you are completely confused about what to do, here‚Äôs something else you can add to the description as a basis: comments on the product‚Äôs creator, a life story, a detailed review of one of the clients, tips on usage, and so on.  But where it will be more competent to cluster the goods. </li></ul><br><br><h4>  The importance of pictures </h4><br>  One of the most significant things for the buyer and the search engine is the quality and quantity of pictures.  Most of the online stores due to the engine or natural laziness will not bother to take pictures of the goods.  And you need to do this, both ‚Äúon the shop window‚Äù and ‚Äúin everyday life‚Äù. <br><br>  For any product, you can take at least 6 photos: the goods in the box for the catalog page, the goods next to the packaging, the goods in hand (or somehow with a person for scale), a close-up of the goods, complete equipment, photo instructions, goods process of use.  The more complex the product, the more close-up photos of its various components, use cases, and so on. <br><br>  If the product is already popular, go through sources with a license to use (social network) - most likely, there in real time post photos from the usual practice of its use.  Carry to yourself if there is nothing else. <br><br><h4>  Reviews </h4><br>  Any product, even a hundred times the same, is most effectively supplemented by reviews.  At first, of course, it is rather difficult to assemble them, but the most proven strategy is to collect them from customers.  And pay attention, sending a request for a review, it makes sense to ask clarifying questions immediately. <br><br>  For example, an entrepreneur, who was remotely familiar to me, collected the best feedback database for his region regarding plastic windows.  Others on the sites had muffled things like ‚Äúeverything is fine, thank you, in time‚Äù, which are difficult to distinguish from those written by the same writer that wrote the card.  At the same guy - a whole treasure trove of worldly wisdom. <br><br>  The secret is very simple: after each installation he sent a request with one specific question.  For example, has it gotten warmer?  And in response, they wrote to him - yes, they say, they drowned the AGW before full, and in January evenings the barrel, clearly, the plants were already cold and crumbled.  And now there is no such thing, and the gas is still twice less out. <br><br>  The second person asked about the noise.  And it turned out that he had a garbage truck driving at night in his yard, which in every way interfered.  And yesterday, after the installation of the crackle, the song screamed up to two, which he learned only from the attendants at the entrance. <br><br>  Cool, right?  So, if there is an opportunity, automate the receipt of feedback - you can even make 5 typical questions per item class and ask random when asked.  Or write with your hands if you are still small. <br><br><h4>  Photo history </h4><br>  Best of all for photo capturing the planet.  This is the first review (yours or the one who tested the product), and photos with the plot, and generally interesting content.  And a bunch of snacks for the search engine. <br><br>  The format is comics, two or three paragraphs are a picture, or the line is a picture, a line is a picture, as in a travel report.  First, what's in the photo, then the photo itself (not vice versa). <br><br>  Plots?  Whatever.  Show assembly and connection in a review in real conditions, principles of use, crash test, a fashionable item on different fabrics, building materials in different environments, interior items in different rooms, and so on. <br><br><h3>  Other materials </h3><br><ul><li>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/mosigra/blog/203490/">Why 98% of the texts on your sites do not work.</a>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/mosigra/blog/203490/">At all.</a>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/mosigra/blog/203490/">And how to fix it.</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/mosigra/blog/236365/">How I chose a hedgehog copywriter</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://megamozg.ru/company/textbroker/blog/22162/">How to make TZ radio easier</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://megamozg.ru/company/mosigra/blog/22192/">How to describe an online store product</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://megamozg.ru/company/textbroker/blog/22770/">How to write the main, and what should not be there</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://megamozg.ru/company/textbroker/blog/23218/">Transaction letters</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://megamozg.ru/company/textbroker/blog/23596/">Presentation for attachment to the letter</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://megamozg.ru/company/textbroker/blog/24122/">Letter of thanks</a> </li></ul></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/298828/">https://habr.com/ru/post/298828/</a></p>
