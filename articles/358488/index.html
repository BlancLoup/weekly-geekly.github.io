Initially, of course, like many things under Windows, this protocol was developed by other people, but Microsoft currently supports and develops it. <br><br>  According to the licensing terms, the Windows Server OS allows, by default, no more than 2 simultaneous connections via RDP to the server; if you need more, then the terminal server is understood and either the number of users or the number of connected devices is licensed.  But by connecting to the server via RDP, you can also provide any solution for remote control of the desktop that is convenient for you: TeamViewer, RAdmin and others.

      This article describes the process of connecting to a Windows server via RDP from many popular operating systems.  In view of this, it turned out pretty long.

You can see the IP address of the server in your account in the ‚ÄúMy Servers‚Äù section: <br><a name="account"></a><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/qh/ik/-l/qhik-lyksu4zsv4wqnmkh16irwq.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/po/uw/z2/pouwz2upi2vibb1srptyzdokqb0.png"><br><br>  If you have ordered a server with 2 or more IP addresses, then you can use any of them to connect to the server - this does not affect anything. <br><br>  Those who pack up for the first time with the creation of a remote desktop often wonder, ‚ÄúWhy do we need these IP addresses and how much do we need them?‚Äù Often also confuse the number of IP addresses with the number of desktops or accounts, or believe that if you go to server at the same address, then opening the browser this is the address the browser will use.  But in reality, this is just a list of external addresses through which you can connect to the server, the work on the server itself does not change in any way after the connection. <br><br>  Most of all, when connected, the default is to automatically transfer data from the clipboard, and also connect to the server and become visible on it the local disks of the device from which you are connecting.  When you immediately click on the "Connect" button, you can see a notification about the possible harm that can be inflicted on both the remote computer and your remote computer.  This is quite possible if you are connecting to someone else's server, which may contain viruses or you are connecting to your own server from someone else's infected PC. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ju/-p/d9/ju-pd9nl-ml8trdwuqpzpvfu3bk.png"><br><br>  By connecting to the newly created and clean server, you can safely disable further notifications and continue the connection process. <br><br>  Next, you will see a window with the entry of authorization data: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/a6/vg/1y/a6vg1ybr2pklhxko6ofafc_c9k4.png"><br><br>  When creating each new server, VPS.house automatically generates a new unique password for it, while on all Windows servers the default user name is <b>Administrator</b> .  The password from the server is also displayed in your account near your server on the ‚ÄúMy Servers‚Äù page: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/o2/hk/df/o2hkdfpv_xtrrdniai__eezcmfs.png"><br><br>  For security reasons, by default, the password from the server is hidden and displayed only by clicking on the "Show password" link, and the site will ask you to enter the password for your account on VPS.house. <br><br>  Please note, that very often when trying to connect to Windows 7, if you copy and paste the password, the system shows an error about incorrect credentials, the same may occur in other versions.  If you are faced with this, simply <u><b>enter the password manually</b></u> and be sure to be case sensitive (enter capital letters in capital letters, and lowercase letters and strictly in the English keyboard layout). <br><a name="ssl"></a><br>  After successful authorization before the session, you will receive a notification about the <b>unsuccessful authentication of the remote computer</b> .  The reason for this notification is that the server-side session is encrypted by default using an SSL certificate that was generated by the server itself, and not by what could have been issued by an authorized certificate authority. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ts/m-/a1/tsm-a1wsryuhhmmf1-6ydenhnh4.png"><br><br>  This notice does not indicate security problems, and you can safely turn it off for future connections to the same server, ticking "Do not ask for connections to this computer again." <br><br>  If you use <b>Windows XP</b> for work and when connecting the system gives an error message with the text <i>‚ÄúThe remote computer requires authentication at the network level, which this computer does not support,‚Äù</i> it means that your PC is very outdated and you need to additionally install a small update, where to get it and How to install <u><a href="https://vps.house/help/credSSP">we described in detail here</a></u> . <br><br>  The built-in remote desktop connection program allows you to easily transfer files to the server by copying them to your PC and inserting them into any folder already on the server itself and vice versa.  In addition, you can enable the transfer to the server of virtually any USB-devices and network printers and scanners. <br><br>  To enable these features, click on the "Show options" button before connecting to the server: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/fk/ip/z6/fkipz6nmhev1mr35_1l70ols2ui.png"><br><br>  The mode of advanced settings for connecting to your VDS server will open.  Go to the ‚ÄúLocal Resources‚Äù tab and tick the devices you need: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/9v/3g/y5/9v3gy5ehlzlfeinbzwyddsbm_sa.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/th/cw/gc/thcwgc3vfoxc9a8vz2zkknizf4w.png"><br><br>  Another very useful and popular feature is the ability <b>to create a ready connection file (the so-called ‚Äúshortcut‚Äù)</b> , in which all the settings and authorization data you need on the server have already been saved.  This is especially useful if you want to give access to an employee who is not an experienced PC user. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/fk/ip/z6/fkipz6nmhev1mr35_1l70ols2ui.png"><br><br>  To do this, in the advanced connection settings on the ‚ÄúGeneral‚Äù tab, enter the user name (on the VPS.house servers it is always the default Administrator), tick the checkbox ‚ÄúAllow me to save credentials‚Äù so that you do not have to enter the password every time and, upon completion of all other connection parameters you need (if any), press the ‚ÄúSave As‚Äù button: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/o9/aw/ma/o9awmadudi6qust6dlggr_rhuqm.png"><br><br>  As a result, you will receive a ready-made connection file that you can send to your colleague and that in turn will connect to the server with 2 simple clicks on it with the mouse. <br><br>  For security reasons, the account password will not be added to this file by default; it will be requested at the first connection. <br><br><hr><br><a name="ubuntu"></a><br><h2>  How to connect to the server via RDP if you are working with Ubuntu </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/vx/kq/x-/vxkqx-fzfdryxuv3tpnldvgka0u.png" align="left">  Windows Remote Desktop Connection Protocol (RDP) is a closed protocol by Microsoft, Microsoft does not issue official services for Linux operating systems, but one way or another, there have been stable solutions that have been included in the latest builds of Ubuntu for some time. <br>  Speech is about a client called <b>Remmina</b> <br><br>  By default, if Remmina is included in your build, you can find it in the Search by request ‚ÄúRemote Desktop Client‚Äù, if not, install it using the following commands in the Terminal. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/lu/pg/_l/lupg_ltiabmr4opsbe3vrnezxya.png"><br><br><ol><li>  Install the Remmina package <blockquote> <code>sudo apt-add-repository ppa:remmina-ppa-team/remmina-next</code> </blockquote> </li><li>  Install updates <blockquote> <code>sudo apt-get update</code> </blockquote> </li><li>  Install the RDP plugin <blockquote> <code>sudo apt-get install remmina remmina-plugin-rdp libfreerdp-plugins-standard</code> </blockquote> </li><li>  If you previously had any version of Remmina installed or was launched before installation, you must restart it.  This is best done by rebooting the computer or using the command: <blockquote> <code>udo killall remmina</code> </blockquote>  If, after its execution, you received an error message of the ‚Äúprocess not found‚Äù type, it means that everything was fine and you could not execute the command. </li></ol><br><br>  In the search menu, type "remote desktop" or "remmina" to find the installed application: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/yc/bf/ll/ycbfllmvilgjv-natxyeax7mlhu.png"><br><br>  Remmina allows you to add and save a list of connections for quick access to a particular server.

To connect to the server, now simply double-click on the server line: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/pk/gx/za/pkgxzamkxkfbjzfvo8mjuzghmvq.png"><br><br>  If you are connecting to the server for the first time from this application, then it can display information about the error in the security certificate.  Why this happens <a href="https://habr.com/ru/company/vps_house/blog/358488/"><u>we described above in the block of connection to the server from the desktop Windows</u></a> . <br>  Just click "OK" and the program will continue to connect to your server: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/wx/oz/cw/wxozcw6yxxrty_5flnydkmtxp6w.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/mf/xv/ca/mfxvcasoabuvyoxyyapkrnjqn3e.png"><br><br><hr><br><a name="debian"></a><br><h2>  How to connect to the server via RDP if you are working with Debian </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/tw/ly/rg/twlyrgmzljaunbk0jdhbfivz65y.png" align="left">  Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) is a closed Microsoft Remote Desktop Protocol.  Unfortunately, they do not release official clients to work connecting to Windows servers from operating systems running on Linux.  However, for a long time there are stable working solutions. <br>  One of the most popular is the client for all kinds of remote <b>Remmina</b> , and we recommend using it for switching on to VPS.house servers or any other Windows OS. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/4b/gv/rc/4bgvrc0tjeoi_jxltcyb8tfayma.png"><br><br><ol><li>  Specify the path to the installation files <blockquote> <code>echo 'deb http://ftp.debian.org/debian stretch-backports main' | sudo tee --append /etc/apt/sources.list.d/stretch-backports.list &gt;&gt; /dev/null</code> </blockquote> </li><li>  Run the installation process <blockquote> <code>sudo apt update</code> </blockquote> </li><li>  Install the RDP plugin <blockquote> <code>sudo apt install -t stretch-backports remmina remmina-plugin-rdp remmina-plugin-secret libfreerdp-plugins-standard</code> </blockquote> </li></ol><br>  Immediately after installation, the application can be found through a program search: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ob/6z/kv/ob6zkvxezvbsxaerm0ykeg3o_y0.png"><br><br>  Unlike the standard Windows OS from the RDP client, Remmina allows you to save to the list all your connections to various servers and provide instant access to them.  To add the first server to the list, click "+" in the upper left corner: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/pk/1p/yx/pk1pyxgrtkxi2ovlsllh3j_t-qk.png"><br><br>  In the window that opens, specify the settings for connecting to your server and enter a convenient server name to remember.

Select ‚ÄúNo more asking for this PC‚Äù and click ‚ÄúAccept‚Äù. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/pv/m4/r_/pvm4r_wv72tzn25lk8c_1jkfg3a.png"><br><br>  If the IP-address and autorotation data are specified without error, you will successfully connect to your virtual server: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/13/ie/0e/13ie0ekvtzutzjnhypt6t90ej3y.jpeg"><br><br><hr><br><a name="android"></a><br><h2>  How to connect to a VPS server from a smartphone or tablet on Android </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/v7/uf/0o/v7uf0owtzfu0gfvr8eklryoates.png" align="left">  For devices running Android, Microsoft is releasing a full-fledged application for working with a remote desktop - <b>Microsoft Remote Desktop</b> .  Download it like any other application on <u><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details%3Fid%3Dcom.microsoft.rdc.android%26hl%3Dru">Google Play</a></u> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/vh/db/tr/vhdbtrh1ovjz_e3_0aulolccfci.png"><br><br>  Unlike all the applications described above for PC connections, the mobile application Microsoft Remote Desktop separates the accounts and the list of connections.  Therefore, you must first add to the list the Administrator user account with its password, which is shown <u><a href="https://habr.com/ru/company/vps_house/blog/358488/">in your personal account</a></u> : <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/0t/ej/du/0tejdui9qc_4wv-2j45oe6r1qj4.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/z_/b5/tq/z_b5tqtmakv4ta0jh3inrm1ablu.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/vi/ok/s2/vioks28kishhi18icl1hpfv0g0q.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/bz/0t/au/bz0taus-ghtpabyb-ryzjgf6otq.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/qy/yj/4f/qyyj4frgf9havciabyl88rfccbw.jpeg"><br><br>  After adding the account, return to the application main screen to add the connection itself (the address of your VDS server): <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ci/yx/9y/ciyx9yx20msaxrlrd5e4kh791w0.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/dg/vq/zk/dgvqzkojn9wdfwuw0fmyb21kxmk.png"><br><br>  In the window that opens, specify the IP address of your server (specified in your <u><a href="https://habr.com/ru/company/vps_house/blog/358488/">account</a></u> ), select the Administrator account you added earlier and click ‚ÄúSave‚Äù: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/yv/vy/no/yvvynoejdapaasjj0h5bb96k_tu.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/hw/lw/zj/hwlwzjxzdr9kczdezf81_rm2ifi.png"><br><br>  Your server will appear on the main screen in the list of connections, just click on it and the program will start the connection.  If you are connecting to this server for the first time from this application, you will see an informational message stating that the application could not verify the encryption certificate.  Why this happens is <a href="https://habr.com/ru/company/vps_house/blog/358488/"><u>described in the beginning of the article</u></a> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/hi/nr/_w/hinr_wsfy3val7zaeavsnstskpi.png"><br><br>  It is enough to tick "Never ask again for connections to this PC" and this notification will not appear again.  Then click ‚ÄúConnect‚Äù and if all autorotation data and server IP address are specified without errors, you will successfully connect to it: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/xt/qa/cj/xtqacjx58rrmzgnolplbjfkxchg.jpeg"><br><br><hr><br>  PS: Customers of our VPS-hosting often have a question how to connect to the server from this or that device.  In the search engines you can find all these instructions, including those with pictures and videos.  I hope this article will be useful here, as containing in one place the instructions for connecting with all the most popular devices and operating systems. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/358488/">https://habr.com/ru/post/358488/</a></p>
