      <b>1. Readers are indifferent to the writing technique.</b> <br>  Some best-selling copywriters are not as literate as our teachers require. <br>  Many of them have no special education.  They break many rules.  But no one notices, readers do not care. <br>  You need to write so that the reader would not be indifferent. <br>  Readers are important emotional component of the text.  If they are hooked by a couple of words, they will read more. <br><br>  No emotions - no readers.  It is truth. <br><br>  <b>2. Readers want to be interested.</b> <br>  You may think that your job is to convey information, but it is not.  Your job is to make the reader read the next word. <br>  Your work is to interest the reader, which means that you yourself must be interested. <br>  Writing a text is more than writing words.  It is like a performance.  Think of the actors performing on stage.  The best of them do not just say, they get used to the role, they feel it.  They wave their hands.  They are joking.  They pause at the right moments. <br><br>  Make your text livelier and make a show for readers. <br><br>  <b>3. Readers want to feel superior.</b> <br>  People are indifferent to those who care only about themselves.  Few people will love admiration for themselves or admiration for their work. <br><br>  Make readers and customers think they are the best.  If they understand.  That you love them endlessly, they will treat you luyashe, which means they will come back to you again and again. <br><br>  <b>4. Readers love individuality.</b> <br>  Readers pay more attention to something interesting and exciting.  They want to be entertained. <br>  Movies and television shows are examples.  On the screen often appear strong personalities that attract the attention of viewers. <br>  You do not believe me?  Remember the 2 most memorable teachers from your school.  Remember everything you know about them. <br>  Now remember the 2 main characters from the movie X-files. <br>  I think the question will be closed. <br><br>  <b>5. Readers like secrets.</b> <br>  Be confident with both readers and customers.  Do not be afraid to be yourself.  A play on words, injections, puns - this is what will make you more realistic for readers and customers.  No one wants to deal with a callous person. <br><br>  Mention some interesting details from your personal life.  Readers will feel that you trust them - and this will give their result. <br>  But never give too much private information.  The story of several secrets should not mean that you have no personal space at all. <br><br>  <b>6. Clients like a lot of experience.</b> <br>  To become an outstanding writer you need to know how to attract and retain a customer.  You must be friendly, helpful and ready to show all your skills to the client. <br><br>  Great experience is what the customer wants to see in you.  Hand on heart, you will almost never hear from the customer: ‚ÄúExcellent use of alliteration in the 3rd paragraph.  And I like your ellipses! ‚Äù <br><br>  <b>7. Readers love confidence.</b> <br>  Your confidence and determination are the factors for your success.  No one likes indecision. <br>  You will have to become arrogant.  And this should be visible in every word of your text.  By gaining more experience you will gain more confidence, thus even more determination will appear in your texts. <br><br>  <b>8. Readers like variety</b> <br>  Every high quality freelancer has a niche in which they are self-sufficient.  They have to choose one thing to be the best in the subject, thereby attracting readers. <br><br>  So what is your niche?  Forward - break all the rules, try to bypass one topic after another.  Make it so that you can name any topic - your topic. <br><br>  <b>9. Readers love modesty.</b> <br>  No one likes arrogant, who consider themselves superior over all people.  Nobody is perfect.  Everyone makes mistakes.  Watch yourself, don't get too arrogant.  Accept the fact that sometimes you can be wrong - because everyone can. <br><br>  Accept your flaws beautifully. <br><br>  <b>10. Everybody likes it when you talk about it as it is.</b> <br>  Skepticism is a symbol of the modern world.  Truthfulness is the most significant quality. <br>  So, when you write - be honest, open and understandable.  Do not treat people like dolls and do not yulite.  Otherwise, readers can feel it and turn away from you. <br><br>  What do you think it takes to become an excellent writer?  And what technique do you use to achieve success in your career? <br><br>  Original article <a href="http://www.seop.ws/10-tips-best-freelancers/">here</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/65564/">https://habr.com/ru/post/65564/</a></p>
