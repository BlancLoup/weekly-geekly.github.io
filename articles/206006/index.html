      The provision on the highest legal force and the direct effect of the Constitution enshrined in the Constitution of the Russian Federation means that all constitutional norms have supremacy over laws and bylaws, by virtue of which the courts should be guided by the Constitution of the Russian Federation. <br><br>  For the purpose of uniform application by courts of constitutional norms in the administration of justice, the Plenary Session of the Supreme Court of the Russian Federation decides to provide the following clarifications: <br><br>  1. In accordance with Art.  18 of the Constitution of the Russian Federation, the rights and freedoms of a person and a citizen are directly applicable.  They determine the meaning, content and application of laws, the activities of the legislative and executive authorities, local self-government and are ensured by justice. <br><br>  Given this constitutional provision, as well as the provision of Part 1 of Art.  46 of the Constitution of the Russian Federation, which guarantees everyone the right to judicial protection of his rights and freedoms, the courts are obliged to ensure adequate protection of the rights and freedoms of a person and citizen through timely and correct consideration of cases. <br><br>  2. According to Part 1 of Art.  15 of the Constitution of the Russian Federation, the Constitution has the highest legal force, direct effect and applies throughout the territory of the Russian Federation.  In accordance with this constitutional provision, the courts in the consideration of cases should assess the content of the law or other regulatory legal act regulating the legal relations considered by the court, and in all necessary cases apply the Constitution of the Russian Federation as an act of direct action. <br><br>  The court, resolving the case, directly applies the Constitution, in particular: <br><br>  a) when the provisions stipulated by the norm of the Constitution, based on its meaning, do not require additional regulation and do not indicate the possibility of its application, subject to the adoption of a federal law regulating the rights, freedoms, duties of a person and citizen and other provisions; <br><br>  b) when the court comes to the conclusion that the federal law in force on the territory of the Russian Federation before the Constitution of the Russian Federation came into force, contradicts it; <br><br>  c) when the court comes to the conclusion that the federal law adopted after the entry into force of the Constitution of the Russian Federation is in conflict with the relevant provisions of the Constitution; <br><br>  d) when a law or other regulatory legal act adopted by a constituent entity of the Russian Federation on matters of joint jurisdiction of the Russian Federation and constituent entities of the Russian Federation is contrary to the Constitution of the Russian Federation, and there is no federal law regulating the legal relations considered by the court. <br></div></div><br>  Our constitution is quite good, it contains very interesting and useful things for citizens.  Unfortunately, for various reasons, the ruling of the Supreme Court and with it the Constitution is almost never applied in the courts.  A familiar lawyer to my question why this is happening, answered in two words: "Russia is not a state of law."  It is frustrating, but it is a reality. <br><br>  Part of this reality is that our fellow citizens very poorly know their basic law, what the idea should be to unite us all, here is a <a href="http://www.levada.ru/10-12-2013/rossiyane-o-konstitutsii">recent survey by the Levada Center</a> , two-thirds of the country have never read it or do not remember anything, and with confident knowledge can boast only 11%.  It seems to me that if more people know the Constitution, then the country will slowly change for the better (the Constitution is now much better than modern federal laws). <br><br>  A few months ago I had the idea to make a service in social networks, which once a day gives an arbitrary quote from the Constitution.  Being a programmer is very good, all you need to implement your ideas is your hands and brain.  I did this, including for myself, in order to be able to constantly remember those ideals to which one should strive.  I took the first 65 articles, these are chapters 1 and 2, the most common things, the features of the structure of the federal government and local self-government go further. <br>  As a bonus, I attach a <a href="http://kulikovtasks.appspot.com/json/constitution.txt">text file with all the articles</a> I have found somewhere, and <a href="">json</a> , which is an array that includes nested arrays with fields for the number of the chapter, article, paragraph of the article and, in fact, the text of the paragraph. <br><br>  The implementation itself is done through Google App Engine, through <a href="https://developers.google.com/appengine/docs/python/config/cron%3Fhl%3Dru">cron tasks</a> .  Every day at 9 am the task is launched, the script takes an arbitrary article and publishes it on Facebook and VK. <br><br><pre><code class="python hljs"><span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">def</span></span></span><span class="hljs-function"> </span><span class="hljs-title"><span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-title">vk_post</span></span></span><span class="hljs-params"><span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-params">(message)</span></span></span><span class="hljs-function">:</span></span> <span class="hljs-comment"><span class="hljs-comment"># VK values = { 'owner_id' : -56504425, 'access_token' : '11111111111111111111111111111111111111111', 'from_group' : 1, 'message': message } method = 'wall.post' url = 'https://api.vk.com/method/%s' % method data = urllib.urlencode(values) req = urllib2.Request(url, data) response = urllib2.urlopen(req) the_page = response.read() def fb_post(message): # FB url = 'https://graph.facebook.com/me/feed' values = { 'access_token' : '111111111111111111111111111111111111111', 'message': message } data = urllib.urlencode(values) req = urllib2.Request(url, data) response = urllib2.urlopen(req) the_page = response.read()</span></span></code> </pre> <br><br>  Sending to Twitter is already through the auto-post of the contact, it was necessary to do so, because the articles are often longer than 140 characters, and so the auto-post conveniently leaves a link to the main post in the VC with the full text.  I tried to add a publication to Odnoklassniki, but I could not figure out the API :) <br><br>  Subscribe to the daily revelations from the constitution here: <br>  <a href="https://www.facebook.com/constitutionRF">www.facebook.com/constitutionRF</a> <br>  <a href="http://vk.com/constitutionrf">vk.com/constitutionrf</a> <br>  <a href="https://twitter.com/RFConstitution">twitter.com/RFConstitution</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/206006/">https://habr.com/ru/post/206006/</a></p>
