Fujitsu‚Äôs global IT service centers are dedicated to unified management, interact with Fujitsu's local offices in 70 countries, and serve customers around the clock in no-weekend in more than 40 languages. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/bcb/fbd/6f9/bcbfbd6f9edceadcb885556d12e6c385.png"><a name="habracut"></a><br><habracut><br><br>  But few people know that one of these IT service centers is located in the beautiful Kazan city, which has already become familiar to many IT specialists, and works under the mysterious name of the Fujitsu Russia GDC (Global Delivery Center).

      By the way, if someone was not in Kazan - we advise you <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DYVucIM6aeeE">to go</a> ! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/89d/4c2/039/89d4c2039f8f009bf3576f437625597e.png"><habracut><br><br>  Today, the guys from Kazan GDC support the IT infrastructure of about 50 companies from 26 countries of the world, mainly from Northern and Central Europe, among which there are the largest global brands widely known to Russian consumers.  And there is nothing surprising in this: in the USA and in Europe, IT outsourcing has long become commonplace; on the contrary, they are surprised if a company does not transfer some of its non-core functions to outsourcing.  After all, it is obvious that for a professional service organization this is the main type of activity; accordingly, it will cope with such work more efficiently and effectively. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/0bc/453/566/0bc45356659b82d75dc58a8e136ddf88.png"><habracut><br><br>  Fujitsu Russia GDC started its activities in 2006, but it was quite difficult.  GDC began its work with the provision of Application Services (software development and adaptation services), and the first project, the Global ISS retail system, was not easy.  The first customer is a global Auchan with a rewriting of an outdated system on Cobol.  There was a moment when it seemed that the initiative to create an Offshore development center (GDC was called that way) was doomed to failure.  But the first difficulties were overcome, they hardened the Kazan guys and as a result, Fujitsu Russia GDC had the first loyal client - one of the world's largest retail chains with French roots, with which Kazan GDC is still working. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a64/b1c/b8c/a64b1cb8c21432f945465c178e486cd0.png"><habracut><br><br>  Soon the first projects of Infrastructure Services and Workplace Services started (ex-Application Packaging (APS), the Retail direction appeared, to which two more were added later - Java and .Net practices. The list of global customers who provided the service was expanded, many transfer projects were carried out Over the past four years, the Fujitsu Russia GDC in Kazan has grown significantly, and in August 2012 (after six months of training and education of specialists), an additional office was opened in Voronezh, and the Voronezh team of specialists started supporting some services. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/3d6/9f9/f71/3d69f9f7168f1b29adfa74fe5317b5b8.png"><habracut><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/62c/90b/666/62c90b6666d0210cf72b1ecd20603956.png"><habracut><br><br>  Today, one of the key areas of work of Fujitsu Russia GDC is the concept of remote infrastructure management (Remote Infrastructure Management, abbreviated RIM) that is quite common abroad.  It includes: <br><br>  1. Monitoring, support and management services: <br>  ‚Ä¢ infrastructure of local and global networks, <br>  ‚Ä¢ security systems <br>  ‚Ä¢ servers, including the level of operating systems, system services and applications, <br>  ‚Ä¢ storage systems <br>  ‚Ä¢ databases <br>  ‚Ä¢ backup and recovery solutions <br>  2. Analysis and installation of software updates, <br>  3. Analysis of performance in order to identify bottlenecks and, if necessary, make consistent changes to the supported IT infrastructure, if the customer wants. <br><br>  An illustrative example of the implementation of RIM is the project of one of the world leaders in the automotive industry, which, to support high standards in the field of IT infrastructure, Fujitsu Russia GDC provides a full range of services for monitoring, operating and supporting engineering functions. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/7bd/b8f/f19/7bdb8ff1994459fb01e0ef5f95fa9ed4.png"><habracut><br><br>  Initially, the customer set a large-scale task - to form an experienced team that can provide the 2nd and 3rd level support lines for more than 50 national sales centers around the world with a total number of users of more than 24,000 people, while guaranteeing impeccable quality of service, efficient use resources and reducing the total cost of ownership of the IT infrastructure for the client. <br><br>  As part of this project, thanks to the well-coordinated work of the Fujitsu Russia GDC team, we managed to accomplish the following tasks: <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ Remote support of enterprise management systems based on IBM Tivoli and Microsoft SCCM; <br>  ‚Ä¢ Remote support for a wide range of server operating systems: IBM AIX, Sun Solaris, HP-UX, Linux SuSe, Linux RedHat, MS Windows Server; <br>  ‚Ä¢ Remote support for Citrix and VMWare solutions; <br>  ‚Ä¢ Remote support for storage systems based on EMC solutions, including file sharing, backup, recovery based on SAN and NAS systems; <br>  ‚Ä¢ Remote support for relational databases running on Microsoft SQL and Oracle; <br>  ‚Ä¢ Remote support for Enterprise Security systems based on McAfee Anti-Virus, McAfee EEPC; <br>  ‚Ä¢ Remote support for Cisco LAN and WLAN; <br>  ‚Ä¢ Remote support for standard workstations based on Windows XP, Vista and 7; <br>  ‚Ä¢ Development, preliminary testing, deployment and maintenance of software packages and standard configurations for Windows XP, Vista and 7; <br>  ‚Ä¢ And many other things <br><br>  As part of the project, the client received not only full compliance with the SLA, but also continuous improvement of processes according to the Fujitsu Sense &amp; Respond methodology, as well as continuous access to the necessary resources in combination with competitive cost of support. <br><br>  Another important focus of Fujitsu Russia GDC is Application &amp; Testing Services: development, testing, technical support, upgrades, porting and software optimization, development and management of business applications, as well as software and infrastructure quality testing.  In this direction, the Kazan team faces no less global tasks.  One of them came from the world's largest retail chain.  According to a study conducted in the retail sector, up to 50% of the cash losses of retail chains are related to the actions of disloyal employees.  The bottleneck is often the usual payment process, where the cashier has direct access to cash and goods scanning, especially during periods of high customer flows.  The solution to overcome this problem was to reduce labor costs, improve efficiency and optimize the scanning and payment process. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ac9/e29/e69/ac9e29e699f2e39ac2e8b619cef1fabe.png"><habracut><br><br>  The project proposed by Fujitsu, allowed to automate the function of receiving money and payment.  In addition, it included the integration of software for payment stations with the POS network existing at the client. <br><br>  As a result of the implementation of the proposed approach, the client was able not only to reduce labor costs, but also to significantly reduce monetary losses from fraudulent transactions at the payment stage.  And the simplicity and ease of use, lack of access to cash for staff reduces the requirements for employees in the cash area. <br><br>  The loyalty of European customers to Fujitsu and Fujitsu Russia GDC as an IT service provider is due to the wide range of services provided and their high quality of services provided by Kazan specialists.  Often it even exceeds the expectations of European customers. <br><br>  In pursuit of this result, Fujitsu Russia GDC makes every effort to maintain customer satisfaction at a high level.  GDC implemented constant quality control and established processes for continuous improvement of services, employees are certified according to the ITIL methodology and undergo regular certifications of technical competencies, the company conducts internal audits.  And the assessment of internal business processes allows you to identify ways to improve efficiency. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/470/d4d/8d9/470d4d8d9109d2c6215fa133c0a63b0c.png"><habracut><br><br>  The fact that Fujitsu Russia GDC is heading in the right direction, focusing on the wide range and quality of services provided, is also confirmed by the recognition of the largest players in the IT market.  In 2013, AppSense, the technology leader in virtualization solutions (UserVirtualization), assigned Fujitsu Russia GDC the status of the first competence center (enter of Excellence).  The company AppSence made this choice after the certification assessment of the competence of all its partners.  Among them, Fujitsu Russia GDC was noted as the most prepared partner for working with AppSense technologies. <br><br>  A friendly team of highly qualified specialists and lined up processes allow Fujitsu Russia GDC to take on tasks of any scale, most of which come so far, unfortunately, from customers from other countries.  Compared to the global market, the Russian IT outsourcing market is still quite young, and until Russia debates about the effectiveness and risks of IT outsourcing, it has long been understood in the West - outsourcing allows you to optimize costs. <br><br>  Obviously, at the initial stage, the money will have to save not so much as to invest, but you need to understand that this is an investment in the development of your own business and optimization of IT processes, which are a crucial asset of the company.  According to experts, the transition to outsourcing on average gives about 15-20% of the savings for the company in the long term. </habracut></habracut></habracut></habracut></habracut></habracut></habracut></habracut></habracut></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/215479/">https://habr.com/ru/post/215479/</a></p>
