      Today the myth is quite popular, according to which work in a startup guarantees an infinite number of interesting tasks and huge earnings if you are one of the co-founders of the company.  About this who just did not tell: from <a href="http://paulgraham.com/wealth.html">Paul Graham</a> to <a href="https://www.jwz.org/blog/2011/11/watch-a-vc-use-my-name-to-sell-a-con/">Arlington</a> . <br><br>  Experts are not always ready to refute this myth and are often forced to support it with all their might.  They represent the corporate environment in the form of a bunch of losers who do not even try to do something other than regular trips to the office from 10 to 6. <br><br>  Simple arithmetic <a href="http://danluu.com/startup-tradeoffs/">calculations</a> show that even the <a href="https://www.glassdoor.com/Salary/Google-Senior-Software-Engineer-Salaries-E9079_D_KO7,31.htm">average</a> wage in an American IT company will allow you to talk about a more stable and predictable level of income. <br><br>  If we talk exclusively about life and work in the United States, many are sure that the very high cost of living will not allow you to accumulate any significant amount of funds over several years of work, but this is not so.  One of the main ways to reduce costs is remote work, which will allow you not to spend extra on renting a house just two steps from the office. <br><br>  Another advantage of the corporate sector is that the recruitment process itself is more predictable and understandable.  On Habr√© and other sites there were a lot of materials about how the process of selecting candidates for Google and other companies is arranged. <br><br>  Jobs in startups means the absence of any level of stability.  Today you are going to a couple of meetings, and tomorrow you have to deal with a fallen project that could not bear the burden after the release of the article on Techcrunch.  Even worse is the situation with those who came to the startup as a hired employee, but this opinion is quite controversial. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d10/0c6/7d4/d100c67d47db4061a9d319964ca3c8d3.jpg"><br>  / Photo by <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/dskley/">Dennis Skley</a> / <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nd/2.0/">CC</a> <br><br>  A startup is synonymous with an IPO or acquisition of a larger company for millions of dollars.  Of course, this is the case, but for a very small percentage of projects.  Experts estimate the chances of an average startup below one percent, and this is quite optimistic. <br><br>  Anyway, success stories do not give rest to the founders.  They take risks and create their projects, forgetting about more comfortable working conditions in large companies. <br><br>  Of course, few people want to spend a few dozen hours every week solely on making money.  Here the most important idea and the opportunity to experiment in the course of its implementation.  Behind this and go to startups. <br><br>  On the other hand, one cannot say that large companies offer only a routine.  If you compare the work, for example in the field of DevOps, then you should seriously think about what you can offer an established team. <br><br>  Most likely, you will be able to get not only a high-loaded project, but a substantial budget for its optimization, along with the opportunity to discuss your tasks and problems with a wider group of experts.  In startups, getting something like this will be very difficult. <br><br>  Many novice experts are skeptical about what kind of experience can be obtained within a large IT company.  Here everything again rests on the myths about startups.  In fact, they are only good if your goal is to gain experience in the field of entrepreneurship. <br><br>  As in the case of an IT corporation, and as part of the startup‚Äôs work, everything will depend on what you would like to do and the efforts that you are ready to make on the way to achieving your personal goals and objectives. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/298006/">https://habr.com/ru/post/298006/</a></p>
