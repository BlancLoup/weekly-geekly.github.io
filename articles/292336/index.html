According to recent surveys, consumers are not only tolerant of mobile advertising, but also susceptible to it.  The volume of use of mobile devices is growing rapidly throughout the world, it is now clear that smartphones are no longer just a device, it is a lifestyle.  More than 60% of small businesses say that mobile solutions play a key role in their work, mobile is a strategy that cannot be ignored. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  With <a href="http://www.byyd.me/ru">mobile advertising</a> , you can get closer to your customers than ever before, using advertising that is personalized both locally and by time. <br><br>  If you are ready to take full advantage of mobile advertising, below are 4 important tips that will help you with this: <br><br>  <b>1. Let it be easier.</b> 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"

      Since mobile phones have small screens, it is important that your ad is as clear and concise as possible.  Remove everything that complicates the purchase - flash graphics, drop-down menu or difficult to find contact information - mobile users do not like to zoom.  On the contrary, give them the most necessary information - your location, opening hours and current offer.  Give them the Call Now button or another CPA button. <br><br>  <b>2. Do not be persistent.</b> <br><br>  Basically, online shopping activity includes an active search by users for information about a product or service.  Mobile advertising offers what is called ‚Äúpush‚Äù technology, which includes sending unsolicited messages to potential customers, and it‚Äôs important to take care of their response.  Example, if a person buys every time, after you give him a discount coupon, keep sending them.  But, always keep track of when it stops buying, because this information can also give you a lot. <br><br>  <b>3. Integrate your campaigns.</b> <br><br>  Mobile advertising should be one of the elements of your strategic marketing plan, along with retargeting, display advertising, desktop and other types.  This is not an autonomous tactic that can solve all your problems.  You need a little bit of everything, and most importantly, track the results that each of the channels gives, so that you can optimize and adjust budgets as needed. <br><br>  <b>4. Use the possibilities of <a href="http://www.byyd.me/ru/blog/2015/07/mobile-programmatic/">programmatic</a> buying real-time advertising</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c7b/255/4ae/c7b2554ae912415d8d70ef0b23154b3b.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The average smartphone owner spends more than three hours a day switching between social networking apps, chat rooms and emails.  It can be said that it is almost always online.  Thus, marketers who want to keep up with their mobile consumers will benefit if they invest in the tools to automatically purchase real-time advertising. <br><br>  Such tools use predictive software algorithms that allow you to perform actions on behalf of the advertiser, intuitively showing the most relevant situations of advertising products.  Targeted real-time advertising allows you to track visitors immediately after their visit to the brand's website.  This is done by delivering personalized advertisements, which in real time use banner spaces and sites that were purchased in advance.  Opportunities for advertising in real time, allow the marketer to reach a promising potential customer while the brand is still ‚Äúsitting‚Äù in his head. <br><br> <a href="http://www.byyd.me/ru/register/%3Futm_source%3Dmegamozg%26utm_medium%3Dpost%26utm_campaign%3Dcontent_marketing"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/041/3c5/29a/0413c529a1424210a02b160e54a40e80.png"></a> <br><br>  <a href="http://www.byyd.me/ru/%3Futm_source%3Dmegamozg">BYYD ‚Ä¢ Mobile Advertising Platform</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/292336/">https://habr.com/ru/post/292336/</a></p>
