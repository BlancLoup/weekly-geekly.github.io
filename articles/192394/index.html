      The history of contextual advertising began 16 years ago in America, when Bill Gross, the founder of the little-known company Idealab, came up with the idea to sell the first advertising space in search results.  To translate this idea, Idealab purchased a license for Inktomi, which is currently used by About.com, Hotbot, MSN, Yahoo and other search engines. <br><br>  In 1998, Bill Gross founded GoTo.com, Inc.  (later it was renamed to Overture Services Inc.), which presented the search engine to the public, where, in response to a search query from the user, suitable advertising links were first displayed, and then - search results based on the ranking of sites. <br><br>  In Russia, the pioneer of contextual advertising was Yandex, which began to place the first advertising links back in 1998. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/8f2/daf/e49/8f2dafe49c13dd1cb66d66f9a191eb66.png" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>Brought to automatism</b> <br><br>  Initially, operations on the contextual advertising market were not available to ordinary users, for example, it was possible to place an ad only through the sales department managers of the company that owned the search engine.  Due to the growing popularity of this service, Internet giants began to think about creating their own automated services that would allow users to customize their advertising campaigns on the Web, thus saving their nerves and time.  This is how Google AdWords, Yahoo!  Search Marketing and Microsoft Advertising. <br><br>  In Russia, this process was automated in 2001, when Yandex.Direct appeared, which immediately became very popular.  In the first year alone, more than 2,500 advertisers managed to work with the system. <br><br>  <b>Contextual advertising in social networks</b> <br><br>  For a long time, contextual advertising has been the prerogative of major search engines such as Google, Yahoo or Yandex.  Then ads began to be placed on the websites of search engine partners.  With the advent of social networks, the use of this tool has greatly expanded and changed. <br><br>  In Russia, the most prominent representative of this trend was the social network VKontakte, which in 2011 completely abandoned the usual banner advertising in favor of targeted advertising.  In addition, in 2012, VKontakte launched its own advertising network, which, <a href="http://www.xakep.ru/post/60350/">according to experts</a> , generates about 500,000 referrals to advertisers' sites in a week. <br><br>  <b>Service placement of contextual advertising from REG.RU</b> <br><br>  REG.RU has recently become an active participant in the contextual advertising market, combining the technological advantages of automated contextual advertising systems and the effectiveness of promotion in social networks in one product.  The company announced the launch of an intelligent service based on the CloudContext platform, which allows you to customize an advertising campaign with the maximum elaboration and depth of selection of placement parameters.  In addition, the new service has a high degree of automation and has a number of effective analytics tools. <br><br>  For REG.RU clients, the connection and setting up of advertising campaigns for VKontakte are now available, in the near future there will be an opportunity to work with Yandex.Direct and Google AdWords. <br><br>  <i>What is the service REG.RU?</i> <br><br><ul><li>  Quickly creates advertising campaigns, allowing you to massively edit and copy ads; </li><li>  Provides the ability to flexibly customize the campaign, including specifying the specific devices on which the impressions will be shown, and an increase in the rate per ad for the audience that provides the largest sales; </li><li>  Calculates a preliminary campaign budget with the ability to set different daily budgets and maximum CPC for different audiences; </li><li>  For existing campaigns, produces a daily calculation of the projected budget with further adjustment of the forecast for the remaining time; </li><li>  Analyzes the effectiveness of the campaign, adjusting its further course based on Yandex.Metrica and Google Analytics data; </li><li>  Independently determines the most active target audience and offers to increase the number of impressions just for her; </li><li>  Provides the necessary reporting on all ongoing campaigns with the ability to export to .PDF; </li><li>  Allows you to pay through a personal account in REG.RU without any additional fees for using the service. </li></ul><br>  With the help of the Content Placement Service, you can create a campaign with any budget - there is no minimum threshold.  Indeed, in this matter, not only the volume of monetary investments is important, but also the competent system settings. <br><br>  You can test the service by connecting it to <a href="https://hosting.reg.ru/cloud-services/advertising/cloudcontext">the service page</a> on the REG.RU website. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/192394/">https://habr.com/ru/post/192394/</a></p>
