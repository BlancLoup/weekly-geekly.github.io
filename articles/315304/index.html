A large construction company Mizol turned to WebProduction with the task of creating a corporate website.  Mizol on the Ukrainian market since 1994.  On account of 900,000 projects.  To create a site that meets the requirements and objectives of the customer had to work. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c58/689/72f/c5868972fe761651ea2683284d09c0dd.jpg" width="960" height="600"><br><h2>  Concept development </h2><br>  At the starting stages you need to clearly define the goals and concept of the site.  It is useful for understanding the client and the customer to pick up examples of other sites that will serve as a model. <br><br>  When the concept of the site was outlined in general, everything else: the look, content, structure - began to emerge quickly. <br><br>  A number of design tasks, layout was performed.  Direct work has begun on the site.  And then there was the first turn ...

    <h2>  Force Majeure </h2><br>  The project manager has changed.  By experience, such changes often lead to bad consequences and strongly throw the project back.  This can be compared with the project of the car - a new designer comes with his vision and begins to change everything in his own way. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/78e/e26/a73/78ee26a73947409b58aac69cdaef228a.jpg" width="960" height="599"><br><br>  It happened in our case, but it allowed us to look at the project in a new way.  The second engineer looked at the drawings of the first and improved them. <br><br><h2>  How to turn visitors into buyers? </h2><br>  For a start, it is important to determine the target audience of site visitors and the goals of their visit to the site.  Based on this, you can choose the best tools to achieve high conversion. <br><br>  When creating a site for Mizol used different methods.  The ‚ÄúMaterials‚Äù tab is in the first place and the interested buyer immediately sees what he is looking for - materials structured by manufacturers. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/0fe/257/f2c/0fe257f2ce7defee2bd59d3519a37427.jpg" width="960" height="538"><br>  For site guests who choose and are not yet sure of their decision, there is a detailed portfolio: <br><br><ul><li>  projects where the product was used; </li><li>  Conveniently implemented detailed presentation of products: description, photo, answers to frequently asked questions, real examples of the use of materials and expert opinions; </li><li>  descriptions of successful projects and open insider information.  Mizol does not openly tell what others are afraid to tell: technologies, methods, etc.  It deserves respect and gains the trust of customers; </li><li>  drawings of real construction solutions that impress with their simplicity and effectiveness.  Rate it can only visitors - experts. </li></ul><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/41e/9c8/b3e/41e9c8b3e7b760d4a626aaf4b1995097.jpg" width="960" height="538"><br><h2>  Attention to details </h2><br>  Every detail was worked out long and carefully.  It wasn‚Äôt easy to make a concise website and conveniently arrange information about the company, materials, projects, terms of cooperation, as well as contact information for all offices of the company and its blog.  I had to try a lot of different options before getting closer to what was intended. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/572/8fa/468/5728fa468273455b42ae556d2cc9e9c7.jpg" width="960" height="573"><br>  In addition to all of the above, it was decided to implement the client‚Äôs personal account module.  This functionality is very relevant today and is appreciated by customers.  It makes it possible at any time to send appeals and track their status, see the balance, place an order and receive operational information about all orders and interactions without calling the manager. <br><br>  We worked on the Mizol project for over a year!  In total, more than 3,500 tasks were completed!  For large projects, the rate is usually around 800. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ce0/094/b81/ce0094b81bf8f9cbab8881aa8118d6ca.jpg" width="960" height="494"><br><h2>  Tips for creating corporate sites </h2><br><ul><li>  Analyze the situation on the market, evaluate the company's development prospects for the foreseeable future.  Decide which tasks your site will solve; </li><li>  Make the site focused on your customers, not for the image or fashion trends.  It is necessary to form a clear idea of ‚Äã‚Äãwho your customers are and what they need; </li><li>  The first look at the site should give an understanding of what products and services your company provides.  Today, people value their time and hardly anyone will read a voluminous text about the company, and consider the photo director on the main page and read his greeting.  The essence of the first place; </li><li>  Take into account the fact that the materials copied from other resources may adversely affect the website promotion in search results.  Generate unique content! </li><li>  On the finished site, do not make colorful elements and texts, flashing headers.  Do not turn the site into a New Year tree - it can alienate visitors. </li><li>  Improve your site and do not expect instant returns from it.  Do not contact the "experts" who advertise rapid promotion, etc.  Try different channels and invest in the most effective. </li><li>  Be patient :) You will succeed. </li></ul></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/315304/">https://habr.com/ru/post/315304/</a></p>
