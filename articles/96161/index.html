  <section class="page js-page"><h1>John Scully: "Why I fired Steve Jobs"</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  In the spring of 1985, Apple's board of directors decided that it no longer needed the services of an eccentric, undisciplined, uncompromising control freak of Steve Jobs - and he was fired.  The rich board members sighed with relief: now no one will secretly glue stickers with apples on the mirrors in the luxurious Rockefeller mansion. <br><br>  The exiled co-founder of the company returned in 1997 to a much more serious person.  Now he is probably the most talented manager on the planet.  Unlike those who fired him. <br><br>  The members of that board of directors are currently working as top managers in various secondary IT companies.  The Daily Beast journalists <a href="http://www.thedailybeast.com/blogs-and-stories/2010-06-06/why-i-fired-steve-jobs/full/">contacted some of them</a> and asked to remember why they made this decision 25 years ago and what they think about it now. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/516/8e9/a90/5168e9a90c9cf0c4c6e8713961661679.jpg" align="right">  The main antagonist of Steve Jobs on the board of directors and the initiator of his dismissal was John Sculley, a top manager of Pepsi, whom the board invited in 1983 to the position of Apple's executive director.  Luring him to work, Jobs himself, according to rumors, said: "Do you want to sell sugar water all your life or do you want to go with me and change the world?"

      In public, John Scully first appeared at the presentation of handheld computers with the Newton MessagePad touchscreen, which took place shortly after he took office. <br><br>  The inventor of the Pepsi Challenge advertising campaign zealously set out to fight the low sales of the Macintosh department and clean up the creative chaos that surrounded Jobs.  In the end, Scalia realized that it was impossible to get along with Jobs. <br><br>  Jobs was unruly and undisciplined.  No one knew what was on his mind and what he was doing.  Jobs came to work in jeans, which in the early 80s was completely crazy.  He went to India for half a year, where he talked about life with local gurus, and then came with a mustache, a goatee and a strange look.  It is said that once Jobs and other top Apple executives were invited to David Rockefeller‚Äôs luxurious mansion for an IPO party, after which the cleaners had to clean the toilet mirrors from the stickers with the multicolored apples. <br><br>  It was Scully who became the initiator of Jobs‚Äôs dismissal from the Macintosh division; he was left with only the nominal president and no real powers. <br><br>  Today, Scully pays tribute to Jobs for everything Apple has achieved, and regrets how it all worked out: ‚ÄúI have not spoken with Steve for twenty-something years.  He still does not want to talk to me and is unlikely to ever want. " <br><br>  Scully was forced out of Apple in 1993, he moved to the position of executive director and president of Spectrum Information Technologies, which filed for bankruptcy two years later.  Today, 71-year-old John Scully is engaged in venture capital investments, listed as a partner of Rho Ventures and director of OpenPeak. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/96161/">https://habr.com/ru/post/96161/</a></p>
