      Rolled pictures - about three megabytes. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  So let's get started </h2><br><br>  What we need: <br><ul><li>  Glass from the old window </li><li>  Two cylinders of white paint spray - 110 rubles \ piece </li><li>  Large grain sandpaper </li><li>  Fine grain sandpaper </li><li>  Water bucket + detergent </li><li>  Acetone or solvent - 60 rubles \ bank </li><li>  Rags </li><li>  Iron corners for furniture - 10 rubles \ piece </li><li>  Wooden bars </li><li>  Screws (large with dowels for mounting on the wall, and small later it will be clear why) - 2 rubles = piece </li><li>  2-4 hours </li></ul><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/b48d3111/c6ad34f0/75b63386/14be5932.jpg"><br>  (Not everything here, but the main set is shown). <br><br><h3>  Step One: Looking for Glass </h3><br>  The first problem you may encounter is finding the right glass.  I was lucky, I found a suitable one on the fifth floor of my house.  I can advise you to look at a landfill or some kind of construction, there is this stuff in bulk.  You can also order a glass cut to the required dimensions in the glass workshop, but this will increase the final cost of the board by about seven hundred rubles. <br><br><h3>  Step Two: Preparing the glass for painting </h3><br>  Found a glass?  Great, now you need to clean it.  On my (window glass), in addition to dust and all kinds of dirt, there was also an old oil paint.  Before painting, all this dirty trick is worth getting rid of (we do it qualitatively). <br>  We take in hands rags detergent and water, we clear glass of dirt and dust.  Then we take a piece of cloth and acetone, and begin to rub out the old paint.  Scratch off?  What a score!  Erase all paint and go to the next step. <br>  I was not so lucky, and the paint was not scrubbed with either acetone or solvent, well, we take a fine grain sandpaper and a cloth moistened in a solvent, now slowly, without pressing, we begin to gently rub the sandpaper paint, periodically wiping the place over which you are now working solvent. <br>  Of course it will leave small scratches, but after painting it will not be visible. <br>  Somewhere in the middle of a fairly long-lasting process, I realized that sandpaper, too, should be wetted in a solvent, it helps a little. <br><br>  Also, the field of this, it is worth the sandpaper with a large grain to walk on the end sides of the glass, in order to round them and avoid cuts during installation and use. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/fb24bcbb/c2c6539b/0ef9fb2f/41d55db1.jpg"><br><br><h3>  Step three: wash the glass </h3><br>  After there is no paint left on the glass, it should be thoroughly rinsed again in order to get rid of the residual acetone and various small rubbish that stuck during the time of getting rid of the paint. <br>  It is necessary that the paint lay down evenly and there are no hairs and dust particles under it. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/4b55c327/29856a14/a7839b10/5ddd8809.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/8836c84f/a239e7fa/aa687aab/49a82cb3.jpg"><br><br><h3>  Step Four: Painting </h3><br>  Well, everything is quite simple, although it requires certain skills. <br>  Take a respirator (preferably), rubber gloves, a paint can and go!  Sprayed paint stands at a distance of about 10-15 centimeters, do not worry that the paint does not go to bed evenly, there are poorly stained places and spots (we are not robots), we will paint in four layers! <br>  Warning !: The main thing is that no smudges form, it is better not to paint one of the layers than to get a smudge, especially in the first two layers. <br>  Spray paint dries quickly enough, about 7-10 minutes per layer. <br>  Putting the final layer, you can slightly neglect the smudges, if there are clearly not stained places, and paint them better (you can apply not four but five, six and even seven layers to these places). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/2b5a94d6/4d2aa97b/a9716b27/25ad6177.jpg"><br>  (First layer) <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/02803dce/8734f8a9/b4c834a1/bd88db41.jpg"><br>  (Third layer) <br><br><h3>  Step Five: Verification </h3><br>  Painted?  It seems everything is fine, let's make sure. <br>  We turn over the glass with the unpainted side to us and inspect it for badly painted spots. <br><br>  If someone suddenly did not understand, the unpainted side of our future board is the front!  Yes, yes, it is she.  The marker on the glass slides much better, and is also scrubbed several times better.  And we painted the glass so that the marker was clearly visible on a white background, and not on a transparent glass. <br><br>  Well, is everything all right?  Then we go further. <br><br><h3>  Step Six: Cooking Fasteners </h3><br>  Options how to attach glass to the wall quite a lot.  You can use special fasteners that are sold in stores, you can drill holes in the glass and screw it to the wall.  Or you can use ordinary furniture corners with small wooden sticks.  I will tell you about the last option. <br><br>  We take a piece of wood and cut several bars out of it, so that when you screw the bar to the corner, there is a gap of about half a centimeter between the corner and the bar. <br>  In this gap is to put some rubber gasket in order to protect the glass from direct contact with solid parts. <br>  Unfortunately, I did not take pictures of the process of making fasteners, but after seeing the finished structure, you will understand everything. <br><br>  We paint it in tone of a board, and we go to a wall on which we are going to hang up our board. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/2f279a59/723901d2/c9bdb232/bd595bdc.jpg"><br>  (Side view with gasket) <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/3522150c/9296ec1f/1fd0b92c/39bf6e4b.jpg"><br>  (View from above) <br><br><h3>  Step Seven: Installation </h3><br>  If you managed to do everything that I described above and did not break the glass, break your arm, or screw yourself to the floor, then I think that you can drill several holes in the wall and fasten the corners to them without my help.  I'll tell you only about the pitfalls that are waiting for you. <br><br>  The first step is to attach the lower corners, so that later you can die out where to fasten the upper ones.  I did it this way: I screwed the two lower fasteners, put the glass on them, and put the upper fasteners, marking their location with a pencil.  Next thing is small. <br><br>  Secondly, it is worth noting that it is quite problematic to insert a sufficiently large and fragile glass into such a construction from the side, therefore, the upper fasteners should unscrew the wooden bars, insert the glass, and then return the bars back. <br><br>  Thirdly, I want to note that the glass recedes from the wall about half a centimeter, which, with sufficient dimensions, gives extra structural fragility.  I solved this problem by gluing on the back side of the glass about ten half-centimeter rubber gaskets.  They do not allow the glass to bend in the center when we intensively erase our washings from it. <br><br><h3>  Step Eight: Rejoice </h3><br>  Laugh?  Nothing funny, I wrote different nonsense on this board for the first 20 minutes, or simply didn‚Äôt take my eyes off her, quality of work, accuracy, what she looks like almost like her analogs for several thousand and the fact that you made it yourself does paradisaic delight. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/f691bbb9/0c1e08a9/a092e027/a57ddbbe.jpg"><br><br><h3>  By the way </h3><br>  As practice has shown, such a board can not only help you in developing a project or thinking about a brilliant plan to take over the world, this great thing at a party is also: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/009f37ce/95dd1612/60705aba/a2e9edc5.jpg"><br><br>  Game 1: We blindfold one of the participants, put it in front of the board, hand a marker, whisper so that no one will hear what needs to be drawn and in front of, the others guess. <br><br>  Game 2: We draw on the board, for example: a donkey, a pig and a mora, a blindfolded player needs to draw a donkey's tail, a piglet is a heel (nose), a person, I will not specify what we added :), but you can have a nose. <br><br><h3>  Finally </h3><br>  For a month of use, the board showed itself well, and fully paid for the time spent on its creation.  I use almost every project I develop. <br><br>  From the changes, I would have made a little more elegant fasteners, these very much stick out. <br><br>  I express <a href="http://geektimes.ru/users/taliban/" class="user_link">my deep</a> gratitude to the users of <a href="http://geektimes.ru/users/taliban/" class="user_link">taliban</a> , <a href="http://geektimes.ru/users/akson87/" class="user_link">Akson87</a> , <a href="http://geektimes.ru/users/pel/" class="user_link">pel</a> , as well as to all those who wished to remain anonymous for raising their karma and the opportunity to write this post. <br><br>  I would be very happy if a picture of such a board made by someone from the community appears in the comments. <br><br>  Suggestions for improving the board, as well as the readability of the post will be glad to see in personal messages or comments. <br><br><h3>  Useful of comments </h3><br>  1. The user suggested to use <a href="http://geektimes.ru/users/gunnzolder/" class="user_link">gunnzolder</a> to give strength and get rid of splinters (in case of an accident) an ORACAL film, so that the fragments do not scatter around the room, but remain on the film. <br><br>  2. <a href="http://geektimes.ru/users/helsq/" class="user_link">Helsq</a> user prompted to use the blade clamped in wooden bars to clean old paint, and <a href="http://geektimes.ru/users/tokimime/" class="user_link">Tokimime</a> user found a more elegant solution: <a href="http://toolsrepairs.ru/page/skrebok-dlya-stekol.html">‚ÄúWindow scraper‚Äù</a> <br><br>  Thanks to them for the additions, I am waiting for new proposals for improving the design. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/131730/">https://habr.com/ru/post/131730/</a></p>
