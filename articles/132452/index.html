E-voting complexes will be installed at polling stations in eight constituent entities of the Russian Federation <br><br>  that is, 10% of polling stations throughout the country will be equipped with electronic ballot processing systems - KOIBs, there will be about 20,000 such complexes.  One COIB with scanners and a printer costs the budget 110 thousand rubles. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b>Information about public procurement data of technical means.</b> <br><br>  <a href="http://zakupki.gov.ru/pgz/public/action/orders/info/common_info/show%3FnotificationId%3D551487">http://zakupki.gov.ru/pgz/public/action/orders/info/common_info/show?notificationId=551487</a>

      <b>2 ways of voting will be used:</b> <br><ol><li>  Ballot Processing Systems <b>(COIB)</b> - in fact, it is a stationary ballot box equipped with a scanner that allows you to ‚Äúread‚Äù information from the ballot.  In this case, the voter votes in the usual way - by putting a sign on the ballot. </li><li>  The complex for electronic voting <b>(CEG)</b> is a touch voting device, using which the voter does not fill in the ballot, but votes by selecting the appropriate position on the touch screen. </li></ol><br>  <b>Consider these systems separately:</b> <br><br>  <b>COIB</b> <em>(ballot processing system)</em> is an automatic system for collecting ballots and counting votes, which minimizes human participation in the process.  The automatic ballot box itself counts the number of ballots, and also recognizes who the vote is for.  KOIB uses optical scanning technology - the device reads voter marks in the ballots. <br><br>  <b>KOIB</b> is a box of dark and translucent plastic, equipped with an electronic system that can operate from both electricity and batteries.  The complex also has a built-in scanner, which immediately reads information from a lowered newsletter.  In exactly 3 seconds, the information will be processed and stored on the built-in flash card.  To lower the bulletin in an automatic ballot box should be face down.  Special sensors will not miss creased, torn, or double folded sheets.  In case of voters having difficulties in working with KOIB, he will prompt how to act, as he is equipped with an electronic warning system.  When summarizing the results, the COIB will automatically check the control ratios of the data entered in the protocol on the voting results. <br><br>  <b>The COIB</b> consists of a scanning device, a ballot box and a printing device (printer). <br>  The operation of the COIB at the polling station is carried out by two operators from among the members of the precinct election commission with a decisive vote. <br><br>  <b>HES</b> <br><br>  Complex for electronic voting <b>(CEG)</b> - a complex of automation of GAS ‚ÄúVybory‚Äù intended for conducting electronic voting, automated counting of votes of voters, referendum participants, establishing voting results and drawing up a protocol of the precinct election commission. <br><br>  <b>The complex for electronic voting provides:</b> <br>  - conducting electronic voting without using paper ballots; <br>  - automated counting of votes; <br>  - establishment of voting results; <br>  - drawing up a protocol of the precinct election commission on voting results. <br>  <b>The structure of one complex includes:</b> <br>  - stationary touch voting devices (USG); <br>  - 2 portable USG for voting at home; <br>  - 2 USG simulators (installed before entering the polling station at each polling station equipped with CEG to familiarize voters with voting on the sensor device) <br>  -      Network Controller; <br>  - service unit; <br>  - mini-printer; <br>  - device autonomous power supply. <br><br>  <b>Technical solution:</b> <br><br>  CEG includes a touch screen, microcontroller circuit and special data files (* .dat, * .bin, * .bmp).  This solution allows you to reliably protect CEG from possible attempts of unauthorized exposure and virus attacks. <br><br>  CEG voting devices do not have the technical ability to connect to the Internet. <br><br>  In accordance with the requirements of the Federal Service for Technical and Export Control (FSTEC), the CEG firmware has been certified for the absence of undeclared capabilities, its code is fixed with a checksum: no other function can be built into the software - the device performs only the vote count in accordance with the basic rules of mathematics: if you add 2 plus 2, you get only 4. <br><br>  <b>The establishment of voting results</b> <br><br>  A printout of the voting results can be obtained at the CEG immediately after the end of voting at the polling station. <br><br>  To draw up a protocol on the voting results, additional information is entered on the service unit.  According to inquiries, numerical values ‚Äã‚Äãof protocol lines that cannot be automatically calculated by CEG (number of voters included in the list on the polling station, number of ballots issued, number of canceled ballots, etc.) are entered on the screen with the mouse. <br><br>  Next, an automatic check of control ratios is performed.  When they are executed, a printout of the protocol on the voting results is made, its verification, then it is signed by the members of the precinct election commission and recorded automatically on an external storage medium - a memory card.  The memory card, along with the protocol printed and signed by the election commission, is delivered to a higher election commission. <br><br>  <b>GEC electronic voting complex</b> <br> <a href=""><img title="COMPLEX FOR ELECTRONIC VOTING (CEG)" src="http://usnet.org.ru/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/-680x485.jpg" alt="    ()" width="680" height="485"></a> <br><br>  <b>Pros and cons of electronic voting</b> <br><br>  Among the positive aspects of the system can be called the impossibility of using the technology of throwing ballots.  And state employees can still vote not on the orders of the authorities.  After all, earlier after the election, many demanded to bring a photographed ballot with a tick in the right place.  CEG allows you to change your decision at the last moment. <br><br>  It is also worth noting that the system will make it more difficult for commissions dishonest to falsify the second voting protocol, rewriting the first one. <br><br>  However, such a system is not able to withstand the methods of falsification that have long been used on sites.  For example, multiple voting of the same voters <em>(in common ‚Äúcarousel‚Äù)</em> , multiple voting with an absentee ballot and, of course, coercion to vote. <br>  And most importantly, you need to understand that the e-newsletter is a program.  And, therefore, the electronic device can be programmed so that it initially counts the voices incorrectly.  As a result, it turns out that no matter how the person voted, the program will count the vote in the column that is written in the specified parameters.  And to fight this is almost impossible! <br><br>  In the case of the widespread introduction of electronic systems for voting, interested parties will be able to provide massive fraud.  And this can happen already in subsequent election campaigns.  It will be extremely difficult to recount the votes recorded by the control tape from a device specially programmed for a wrong count.  Data from it will be recalculated manually only by the decision of the election commission or the court. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/132452/">https://habr.com/ru/post/132452/</a></p>
