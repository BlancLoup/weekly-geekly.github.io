  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Epigraph to perl 5.16.0</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"> By tradition, each perl release is announced by a letter starting with a quote selected by a release engineer.  For the Perl version 5.16.0, I chose the penultimate stanza from Wystan Hugh Oden's verse ‚ÄúSeptember 1, 1939‚Äù. <br>  The text of the poem is <a href="http://ng68.livejournal.com/481322.html">easy to find</a> , so I will not reproduce it here in full. <br>  The poem was written immediately after the start of the Second World War and reflects all the bloody porridge that began.  It tells about the feelings of people around the poet: their lives were captured by quiet despair, the like of which they had never seen.  Not only because of the approaching chaos, but also because of the struggle that will continue to continue: to live honestly, be happy and be loved. <br><br> <code>  <br>    , <br>   ‚Äî <br>    .</code> <br> <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  The Internet is a strange and terrible thing.  Larry Wall wrote: ‚ÄúThe social dynamics of the network is a direct consequence of the fact that they have not yet invented a protocol by which one can remotely strangle a person.‚Äù  It's true.  And this is also a consequence of the fact that many invented protocols are used to remotely insult a person.  It is very easy to insult someone by e-mail, IRC or a blog post. <br>  Over the past nine months, I've gone from reading most of the Perl 5 Porters mailing list to reading this newsletter completely, even when it was disgusting, and you know what I'll tell you: this sucks. <br>  Although, frankly, before it was even worse.  Even I, a relative newcomer, remember those dark times when each topic rolled into a flame.  Compared with those times - now civilized society.  But compared to a civil society, things are bad. <br>  I see at least two reasons.  The first is that when someone without special technical merit posts an insult, it is considered normal to offend him in return.  That is, the words ‚ÄúHe first began‚Äù are considered quite normal defenses.  The second reason is that we do not punish the technically useful members of our community for bad behavior, because they are useful.  They are like rock stars.  Of course, these two problems are connected.  When a novice insults a community veteran, and the veteran responds in a heightened tone, it seems to everyone that this is necessary. <br>  I remember someone's speech at OSCON 2011: ‚ÄúWhen we say that this community requires thick skin, it means that we have started natural selection only for thick-skinned people.‚Äù  It also means that people will become more and more thick-skinned and more and more to love the flame and we are doomed to roll into nastiness.

     <code>   , <br>      <br>     . <br>    !</code> <br> <br>  Of course, this problem exists everywhere on the Internet.  In the communities of each programming language.  We still do not quite look like the main nest of scum and scoundrels of free software.  Because they say that the free software community is a meritocracy, where those who make the greatest contribution deserve the greatest respect.  And therefore they are allowed to insult others. <br>  This means that the most cruel people will flourish, not the best.  When the culture around the project becomes too stinging, many useful people leave (or refuse to join) precisely because in this culture one can freely insult non-specialists.  This is not a meritocracy. <br><br> <code>   , <br>    <br>    <br>   , <br>    <br>  . <br>      <br>   ,</code> <br> <br>  Larry said at the YAPC conference last year that trolls should be ‚Äúembraced‚Äù and insulted - this is the wrong answer insult.  And the correct answer is patience, correction, explanation, and civilized disapproval.  So we express love, trying to improve our troll so that he no longer has to do trolling. <br>  Here is my epigraph to the release of Perl 5.16.0 <br><br> <code>  , <br>    , <br>    <br>    , <br>    , <br>    . <br>   . <br>    . <br>   . <br>    : <br>   .</code> <br> <br>  <i>Translation of poems - Andrey Sergeev</i> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/144317/">https://habr.com/ru/post/144317/</a></p>
