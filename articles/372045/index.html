I do not exclude that this is not interesting to anyone.  However, under the cut a short story about the VR18 +. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a67/4f3/eaa/a674f3eaa1394f5cb83338893551da85.jpg"><br><br>  <i>Caution.</i>  <i>Inside there are pictures marked 18+</i> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The quote, which sounded in releases from PornHub, that the technology promoted in a similar way, which is still not very widely applicable, is ‚Äúdoomed to success,‚Äù is in fact almost a tracing paper from the words of an American psychotherapist: ‚ÄúPorn has always been a trailblazer in adopting new technologies, I think porn. ‚ÄùMichael, Aaron.

      That is, the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãmoving a product or service through pornography is not an innovation.  At the same time, VR's impressions in such a delicate area have been shared since the beginning of the 2010s.  Here, of course, the Japanese.  Not only did they create special content, it was also very interesting ‚Äúsimulators‚Äù that gave him a ‚Äúbonus‚Äù.  For example: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b1f/a5f/375/b1fa5f375ea5437595fff6e2d40c5cd6.gif"><br><br>  At the same time, pay attention to how condescending and with what graceful indignation this was described in our press.  Here is the <a href="http://hitech.newsru.com/article/12nov2013/simulyator_jp">news of 2013</a> .  At about the same time, they talked about the ‚Äúgamification‚Äù of 18+.  The first developers were Sinful Robot, who promised an erotic game for Oculus Rift, but then some of the main ones merged with the money.  The project was saved, and already in 2013 presented teasers (Caution). <br><br><iframe src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://player.vimeo.com/video/68550959&amp;xid=17259,15700022,15700186,15700190,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhhwaA4QKb8TdsSyGXSzb1JLvQ0BTw" width="504" height="315" frameborder="0" title="Wicked Paradise Animation Test" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  Somewhere in 2013, the VirtualRealPorn website was launched.  Content is paid, content is not enough, and the site collects with the world on a thread, in fact, not cooperating with any of the studios.  However, at that time the studios themselves could not boast of mass production of ‚Äúvidos for the cardboard‚Äù.  For this site stuck proud "N1". <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/692/afe/484/692afe4841554a7aac1a461d73640a70.png"><br><br>  In general, before listing those who are engaged in this industry, it is worth adding a few words about toys for adults.  The short history of the development of ‚ÄúVR Porn‚Äù is very similar to the history of a ninth-grader who asks for a computer to study.  Here we also observe at first very good intentions, right up until last year, when an <a href="http://motherboard.vice.com/read/sex-ed-in-vr-can-prepare-young-women-for-actual-sex">application</a> was announced designed to help the ‚Äúbeginners‚Äù. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/afe/20f/435/afe20f435a7f446f9fd0fcd7be6c4ca8.jpg"><br><br>  The players were offered several scenarios from a male or female character who could ‚Äúplay‚Äù uncomfortable questions about the means of protection or the presence of STDs from a partner, so that during a real meeting there would be no excessive complexion, and after sexual intercourse - unnecessary problems. <br><br>  At the same time, the current partner of PornHub, the BaDoinkVR project, also spoke at the same time.  The general director of the company <a href="http://fortune.com/2016/01/28/virtual-reality-sex-life/">claimed</a> that VR-technologies will contribute to a soft overcoming of complexes and phobias, in particular, related to sex. <br><br>  Physical toys began to be added to games for learning applications, and the money for such gadgets were collected without any hesitation at crowdfunding sites.  One of the most exciting recent projects, perhaps with <a href="https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/ejaculator-vr-headset-sync-d-stroking-adult-toy">Indiegogo.</a> EJaculator, is a special ‚Äúwearable‚Äù device with a joystick that should be used with a VR headset. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/5cc/4a5/c48/5cc4a5c4899b44e982f76c2331d48c45.gif"><br><br>  And in the <a href="http://uproxx.com/gammasquad/virtual-reality-sex/">article</a> that appeared a month earlier, in August 2015, another similar device was shown, but without remote control. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/CBXpCFKj91U%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700022,15700186,15700190,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhj3uMcqVy4CsnJmxBrHNTYh5Emx2Q" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  It was curious to note that the moral side of the question, as it turned out, is of concern to many.  In particular, virtual-real relationships are raised to the rank of full-fledged betrayal by some.  On this account it is possible to get acquainted with <a href="http://motherboard.vice.com/read/is-an-affair-in-virtual-reality-still-cheating">such material</a> . <br><br>  <b>A few words from the heading "Analytics"</b> <br><br>  Everything is quantifiable, but, blessing, the rapid development of VR is a trend of recent years, and VR18 + is even less so that you can still count on your fingers.  Now there are a couple of large blogs that collect information about this kind of content, and all the major studios are gradually joining the race. <br><br>  <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/medgadgets/blog/253126/">Naughty America was one</a> of the first to speak about it last summer, and we looked at their successes at the same time: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a67/4f3/eaa/a674f3eaa1394f5cb83338893551da85.jpg"><br><br>  To date, their playlists have: <br><br>  <b>VRBangers</b> is a relatively new site, in the arsenal of which there is not a big list of films - just five pages.  The site specializes only in 360 content, and for membership in the club will have to pay. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Screen 18+</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/488/a15/c21/488a15c2135f437385b0900822a76056.jpg"><br></div></div><br><br>  <b>Dorcel VR</b> is a near-legendary project, the Marc Dorcel studio, famous for the Russian Institute film series, is currently promoting VR content. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Screen 18+</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/455/d6b/547/455d6b547bd3439eabdba530f1e878df.jpg"><br></div></div><br><br>  <b>Vixen VR</b> is an erotic project, something like a strip club, where half-naked girls do some household chores, and you look at it.  Content is paid, and it is not very much. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Screen 18+</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/bde/bfc/a7d/bdebfca7d7064cefac190771a765edce.jpg"><br></div></div><br><br>  <b>Virtual Porn 360</b> is a small library of 360-degree films. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Screen 18+</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/83f/6c1/612/83f6c1612dfd4037becd15bfebe7b87b.png"><br></div></div><br><br>  <b>Hologirls VR</b> is a popular, but not very rich content project.  The video is offered to download or view online on your smartphone.  Adapted videos for Cerdboard, Gear VR and, of course, Oculus. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Screen 18+</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/45c/4ba/d48/45c4bad4887047f8929fa59c1a4cb6d6.jpg"><br></div></div><br><br>  <b>Czech VR</b> is a studio known for its a-la amateur videos, according to the plot of which girls are offered an ‚Äúunlimited‚Äù amount of money until they agree to make contact.  Branches is a similar "eat" guys guys.  In the category of VR is currently traditional subjects. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Screen 18+</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/1e5/5df/975/1e55df975a1d4b05924b8dae86e1f9d7.png"><br></div></div><br><br>  Nevertheless, a separate project from the ‚ÄúGayVR‚Äù category exists.  There is no need to mention it, and there is no need to upload screenshots.  Also separately there is an analogue of "live" video, video from webcams in the format 360 - <b>VRTube.xxx</b> , a similar project - <b>AliceX</b> . <br><br>  So, by and large, PornHub is far from the first, but here we are faced with the fact that the content will be free and, probably, from various resources, for which, of course, thanks a lot to the site, for this is the meaning of popularization: to make available for all that was previously forbidden or for money. <br><br>  They are trying to assume at once several projects, among them, for example, Market Watch, about how the market will develop.  In their article, they once again emphasize that on the one hand, pornography strives to integrate into everything new, but on the other hand, this gives popularity to everything new.  Closed the circle. <br><br>  According to <a href="http://www.marketwatch.com/story/how-the-future-of-virtual-reality-depends-on-porn-2015-07-15">the</a> data <a href="http://www.marketwatch.com/story/how-the-future-of-virtual-reality-depends-on-porn-2015-07-15">provided,</a> VR adult content by 2025 will give a turnover of approx.  $ 1 billion. The report also shows that the video of this sector is far from the last place: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/27c/c2c/c43/27cc2cc43dac4aeba8597645316ad948.jpg"><br><br>  At the same time, according to the authors of the article, it is the porn industry that is more likely to force the user to pay for viewing or owning content, rather than the creators of games or regular films. <br><br>  How the digital content for adults will develop up to 2025 is described in <a href="http://www.juniperresearch.com/researchstore/content-applications/digital-adult-content/trends-forecasts-revenue-opportunities">the</a> Juniper <a href="http://www.juniperresearch.com/researchstore/content-applications/digital-adult-content/trends-forecasts-revenue-opportunities">report</a> .  The company believes that by 2025 the bill will go to billions! <br><br>  Some go even further, arguing that a ban on reproducing specific clips may mean a product crash.  In particular, such thoughts <a href="http://www.express.co.uk/life-style/science-technology/649200/PlayStation-V-Porn-Naughty-America-Adult">were expressed</a> regarding the PlayStation VR. <br><br>  This is where our short story reached the final.
