  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How to ‚Äúpack‚Äù inventory with maximum profit for partner sites?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Today we will talk about how to "pack" inventory with the maximum benefit for partner sites. <br><br>  No one has long argued that programmatic buying is the best way to manage performance for both publishers and customers.  This proves the experience of Xaxis, which merged with 24/7 Media and changed its strategy: it moved from purely algorithmic procurement to helping sites understand how to best organize and present their inventory, to be bought by companies like Xaxis.  This is not always a simple process, because publishers must take into account a number of key points. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/7de/0cc/003/7de0cc003e534f569ada5b23e1c89b65.jpg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  However, before delving into these guidelines, it is necessary to understand what we mean by the word ‚Äúprogrammatic‚Äù.  After all, this term in the market space has several interpretations.  Programmatic is responsible for automating the process of media buying using electronic systems that reduce the number of mechanical operations.  Media purchases can take place in an auction format or at a fixed price.  Some experts use the term ‚Äúprogrammatic‚Äù in the same vein as the concept of ‚Äúexchange buying‚Äù, but this approach is not always accurate.  There are many ways to implement software inventory, so all steps must be carefully verified to explain our intentions to partners. <br>  <i>Here are some useful tips for implementing campaigns with maximum benefit for both the seller and the buyer.</i> <br>  <b>1. ‚ÄúViewable‚Äù and transparency</b> 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>

      Publishers should pay close attention to filling their banners, eliminate clutter of advertisements or constantly update them, make large ad units more accessible and place ads in places that are characterized by a large number of views.  By providing customers with transparency in the bid request process (at least at the domain level), you gain their trust and make it clear that you are serious about their black / white lists. <br><br>  <b>2. Packaging (packaging)</b> <br><br>  Before selling ad impressions, they should be grouped into categories depending on the parameters of the target audience, in other words, pack.  The purpose of the site is to present the inventory in the most favorable light, therefore during the ‚Äúpacking‚Äù it is necessary to think about all popular / general categories and audiences in order to increase the chance of hitting the bet on your inventory. <br><br>  <b>3. Price</b> <br><br>  Creating a multi-level placement architecture gives the seller more flexible pricing control and prices commensurate with market demand.  Buyers are willing to pay a higher price for high-quality inventory.  But if it comes with the ‚Äúsecond screen‚Äù inventory or high-frequency displays, this usually leads to the lowest possible rates. <br>  <b>4. Privileged access</b> <br><br>  When targeting the largest and strategically important buyers, publishers should ensure that such customers will have privileged access to a unique inventory (first look).  This will increase the number of high-value buyers and stimulate demand for inventory. <br><br>  <b>5. Data</b> <br><br>  Some customers (for example, Xaxis) are ready to buy unique anonymous data from sites in order to use them to make better commercial and creative decisions.  By offering key strategic partners access to their data, the sites ultimately receive maximum rates and long-term mutually beneficial relationships from them. <br>  <i><b>Paying close attention to these basic rules, you can establish close contact with the most serious buyers, significantly increase your income, fully satisfy the needs of clients and significantly improve interaction with users within its target audience.</b></i> <br><br> <a href="http://www.byyd.me/ru/register/%3Futm_source%3Dmegamozg%26utm_medium%3Dpost%26utm_campaign%3Dcontent_marketing"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/041/3c5/29a/0413c529a1424210a02b160e54a40e80.png"></a> <br><br>  <a href="http://www.byyd.me/ru/%3Futm_source%3Dmegamozg">BYYD ‚Ä¢ Mobile Advertising Platform</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/297278/">https://habr.com/ru/post/297278/</a></p>
