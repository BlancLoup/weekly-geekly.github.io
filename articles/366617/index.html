Vasya!  Show yourself to man!  Well, what are you hurtling, show yourself!  Well, what are you?  About got into the tank, hiding.  She doesn't like being told about him. <br>  He knows what!  He knows how fumbling in computers!  He finally lived a chocolate, some Labal programs, yeah.  Well, like, a programmer, yes.  Sour received, by the way.  In their office, all the crimson people lived, because they worked for America, they paid them with bucks, and the buck is now in business, you know. <br>  And they sent them from America a crap like that, curled up, like glasses, only talking.  Or no.  This is you with these glasses bazaar, yeah, and they show you cartoons right in the eye.  Well, or hockey.  So you say to them: ‚Äúhockey in the eye!‚Äù - and you sit, go for ‚ÄúCSKA‚Äù.  Yes, Vasya? <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Yeah.  They sent, it means, and said: watch your hockey, just make it so strong and use it.  And Vasya took ours and even turned on, yeah.  He taught these glasses to look straight into the soul.  He himself explains everything confusedly, then he says, they say, he trained glasses, then some kind of mesh.  Vasya, what kind of mesh did you teach to look into the soul?  Oh, neutron! <br>  About the neutron bomb, by the way, do you know?  I remember, the foreman told us, even under the Soviet Union, how they had experienced this bomb: you are so stupid!  All the dead, and the equipment is, the houses are, chic, brilliance, beauty, yeah. <br>  So what am I talking about?  He taught this neutron grid to socialist vision.  What, Vasya?  Social?  Well, one hell.  It is scientifically.  And in Russian - to look at the soul. <br>  Well, now you are staring at me now - this is how I understand that you are a cudgel.  And the crap is this neutron one - it would immediately see through you about these ... how are they?  Vasya, how are they?  Micromic?  For micromo-mimic movements - here! <br>  Vasya, and you have the leaf that you showed me?  About social vision? <br>  Yeah, look, this is Vasya himself translating from an English book with a dictionary.  Didn't you, Vasya, translate?  Who?  Gogol trans-what?  ABOUT!  Look, it was Gogol himself who translated it for Vasya!  Trans Lt.  Did you read Gogol as a child?  Not?  On, read! <br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Read Gogol</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  The human visual system is especially tuned to effective and surprisingly when processing social cues.  We can effectively ‚Äúread‚Äù the mental and emotional states of other people and make hasty judgments about our characters and dispositions just by observing them.  Given that, of course, is the close relationship between vision and social interaction, it is becoming increasingly clear that social psychologists who seek to better understand the functional and neuroanatomical mechanisms underlying social perception that vision plays an important role in developing and maintaining social exchange.  Similarly, vision scientists came to understand deep impact people, like social agents, had on the visual system, recognizing how important it is to take into account the socially adaptive functions that the system has evolved to perform.  This book explores biologically determined culturally-imaginative influences on social vision.  Four themes arise.  These include: visually mediated attention moderate complex social interactions and plays an important role in the development of social cognition;  visual perception features; identify categorical thinking and have deep downstream effects, including stereotype activation;  perceptions of experience can be directly caused by visual signals, in this case, visual and social perception are essentially equivalent processes;  and social factors have a powerful effect from top to bottom on even a low level of visual perception, several times shifting, while others have a fine tuning of the perception of visual acuity.  This book marks a new field of social vision, and showcases cutting edge and extensively interdisciplinary research that is currently at its forefront. <br>  The Science of Social Vision <br>  By Reginald B. Adams, Nalini Ambady, Ken Nakayama, and Shinsuke Shimojo <br></div></div><br>  Got it?  That is why I do not like Gogol.  It seems all the words are Russian, and horseradish understand.  But not the point. <br>  He taught, it means that these glasses look people in the soul, and what happens.  You go this with glasses.  You meet a girlfriend.  And hryas be immediately her forehead: where yesterday hung around, huh ?!  She was taken aback for a moment, she twitched her face like that, then quickly realized what to expect from you, and said: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not hanging around anywhere, I‚Äôve been waiting for you all evening!‚Äù lying as breathing. "  And where, when, with whom - all that she has displayed on the impudent hara! <br>  The right thing, huh? <br>  And he sent this his program for points back to America.  And what do you think?  As it is, Pindos took everything away.  Little of.  They shortened these glasses to glasses alone.  Such small ones, so that they can be inserted directly into the eyes - and they are not visible.  The short limbs are called. <br><img align="left" src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ac4/995/1e3/ac49951e38884036b2e44633ae91abb6.jpg" width="400" alt="dmitthewind"><br>  And that's it!  These glasses were expensive, horror!  But all the fashion chiefs, of course, were required.  That is, you will crackle, suppose, at work alcohol.  You go exactly, do not scorch.  And you will be caught by the supply manager - he will look at you!  - and immediately knows before gram: how much, when, with whom.  Everything in your hara reads like a sheet. <br>  Then almost everyone had it.  Can you imagine what life they had?  Darkness.  Neither chop anyone, nor the woman's brain to powder.  And you can't turn it back: the one who took these limits was immediately at a disadvantage.  He is like everyone else on a platter, but he cannot understand anything about others.  As he knew when to understand people, he had already forgotten, while these glasses all told him. <br>  Americans money shoveling rowing for the program - and Vasya is hell yes polshish!  Well Vasya got angry at them then!  Stole yourself at work such limzy and gepnul them.  So, Vasya?  And, hacked, in.  In short, twirled them in something.  Well, as in them.  Vasya says, somewhere in the north he twirled.  So, Vasya?  He says that all their data went through the north.  Through Magadan, Vasya?  In short, he pereter with someone in this north, agreed, and the data on Vasya were replaced with the ones Vasya needed.  Vasya knew his program as flaky. <br>  And in order to quickly transfer to the north, what kind of data about Vasya to substitute instead of the truth, Vasya invented how these limses and other causes would be directly attached to the brain.  How, Vasya, is it called?  Negro ... Negroface, in. <br>  It was here that Vasya's card flooded.  Literally.  He has become a gambler.  In the cards, this is very much appreciated, when no one can understand anything about you, even through glasses-showers.  In the "tryna", for example, yes Vasya?  Well you played the "trynju"?  Well, what, Vasya, immediately "poher"?  And I wonder.  In general, all that Pindos Vasya for the program nedodali-Vasya on the cards beat off. <br>  Healed - like a king.  Not a house - a palace.  Garage for fifteen cars.  But, of course, the woman spoiled everything.  Vasya fell in love.  And it would be okay in a normal stupid woman - so no, I found a smart one.  Ukatal girl for one or two.  Of course, when you know everything about her, and she thinks that you are the most honest fraer in the world ... Also rich. <br>  And if you, Vasya, are a man, foolish woman, as it should be.  But no.  Conscience seized.  I decided to tell everything about myself. <br>  And she told him: ‚ÄúVasya, I know everything about you.  I broke your neutron grid, there was nothing to store the password from it in dirty socks.  And I left you a long time ago.  And now the program is talking to you, the virus I wrote. ‚Äù <br>  Oh, Vasya got angry, he removes his own limits, tears off the nonface - and what do you think?  - Vasya is sitting in ‚Äî he is in that garbage bin, where I found him that month.  No wife, no home, no car.  All sensations to him from the north are the filthy slal virus, through the negroface. <br>  When I saw him, I thought, blissful: he is sitting, in a good suit, - this one, on me now - smiles, smeared, fucked up, with this little leaf in his hands, but talks babble interesting conversations.  I fed him for a month, fed him, listened like a radio, a theater in front of a microphone - do you know?  - until he suddenly picked out his limits. <br>  So it was.  I sit, listen to him.  And he is like this: ‚ÄúYou, Masha, don‚Äôt know much about me ...‚Äù And in a minute they will be tired and let my eyes be picked out!  I ran away, I thought, everything: it was quiet - it became violent.  And he poked his eyes, tore out a shred of hair and froze.  Sits numb. <br>  I had his day "triple" otpaivat.  Now nothing, walked away.  We are preparing to break the new north, more abruptly than before.  Just no more women, so, Vasya? <br><br>  <i>Ps.</i>  <i>Warning questions "is the author of something else like that?".</i>  <i>There was <a href="http://megamozg.ru/post/2476/">another Exercise</a> , published on Habr√©, but with its collapse left, for some reason, to Megamind.</i>  <i>Other "attempts at writing" will be here off-topic</i> </div>
