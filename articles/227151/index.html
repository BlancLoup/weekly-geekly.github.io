  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Screaming experience failures</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  I wrote such a post, which I usually do not read.  No time.  There are many ideas in my head, and I don‚Äôt know which one to implement first.  No time to read non-technical information. <br><br>  This is not a success-story, but some kind of ‚Äúway of the failures‚Äù of a person who wants to create something of his own, something cool and useful for many, to be honest, free and work for himself.  If this is about you, then <b>please read this post and do not step on my rake.</b>  <b>Take 10 minutes</b> .  I will try to speak short and to the point. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  I am the creator.  I always want to create something new.  I would give a lot of links here, but the post will be considered for PR.  I have a lot of ideas in my head, and new ones are constantly being born.  From some it is theoretically possible to make a profit, and some only to satisfy their own interest.  You can see <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/xakepehok/topics/">my posts on Habr√©</a> to see at least something.  I am a PHP programmer (+ MySQL, JS, HTML, CSS | NGINX, debian and many more skills), who can easily get a job with a salary of about 100+ tr.  per month, but however I live on a measly 20 tr.  per month.  Behind there are a couple of major projects, one of which has over two million code symbols written by me personally during the year. <br><br>  <b>The reason for most of my failures is the wrong teammates / companions.</b>  I always wanted to do all my ideas with someone else.

    <h4>  How to do business with friends </h4><br>  Best of all - no way.  Everyone probably heard about it.  But I thought this: these are my friends.  I am sure of them.  If someone is unlucky, it does not mean that I, too, will be unlucky.  But alas, I was wrong.  This is a dead option.  Well, when friendship grows out of business, but not vice versa.  Better not even try.  But if you decide to try, then drop this idea as soon as your friend does not fulfill his duty for a reason that you <b>do not respect</b> . <br><br><h4>  How to choose mates / companions </h4><br>  You can find a smart, talented, responsible person who has something behind them.  Such as you.  This person will agree to work with you, get inspired by the idea and start working.  And there will be fruit.  Just consider one thing: such a person will have his own ideas, which will be more interesting to him, and which he will implement himself.  Such a person will leave you at any time.  Keep this in mind. <br><br><h4>  How to allocate shares in the project </h4><br>  By offering another person to work on the project, you will inevitably determine the shares in the project.  If your project idea is yours, then always keep at least 70%.  Then you will be able to reduce your share in favor of the companion, but only then, after the results.  <b>No 50/50,</b> otherwise the situation may turn out when your companion worked first and then stopped, and still insists that he has a 50% share. <br><br><h4>  How to distribute shares in the project 2 </h4><br>  Do not reduce your share in the project below 50%.  Yes, you started working.  Your companion works.  It seems to work well.  He promises that everything is cool and a lot of work.  Asking for a share more.  So: do it smoothly, and in fact, how it will be "cool and work a lot."  And try to keep a "controlling stake" in your home.  Keep yourself 55%, but definitely not lower than 50. <br><br><h4>  How to start a project </h4><br>  Yes, you have heard 100,500 times that you need to first build a prototype, test it in practice and only after that seriously.  But perfectionism often takes its toll.  You have not yet worked out the idea, but you are already selecting a VPS provider for the project and you think what to do on mysql will not be optimal, but faster than on mongo.  Yes, damn it, do whatever you want, check.  Maybe you are not writing a viable gizmo. <br><br><h4>  Who to start the project with? </h4><br>  With no one.  On their own.  Do it yourself.  Make a damn prototype alone.  Do not offer anything to anyone, do not involve anyone in the project.  If your prototype shows results, cut it on your own and save money to hire someone (not your friend's), not your friend) for salary.  Once again: if you need money for your project, then save it yourself, borrow from relatives / friends, go to start-up incubators, but just please do not attract friends, promising them a 50% share for giving you money for the project .  Your elbows will bite later.  If the investor is a normal investor, not your neighbor or former classmate. <br>  If you dig a little deeper, you will understand that you can handle it yourself! <br><br><h4>  What and who to trust </h4><br>  It may happen that your partner will not be engaged in the code, but will be engaged in the development of the project, writing texts, etc.  etc.  So: do not give him access to the code.  In this case, immediately discuss: your code.  This will give you extra leverage.  Disagreements - we wrote down our version separately with blackjack and ..., but left the old one, without giving access to the server. <br><br>  For the most part in this article, I have scolded myself.  But they are such a rake.  I want to attack and attack ... Most of these problems will disappear if you approach these issues shamelessly.  For example, doing something behind someone‚Äôs back. <br>  I would be glad if I reached someone. <br><br>  PS This is not whining.  And I'm not offended by anyone.  This is the experience that I share.  Let's bypass the rake! <br><br>  upd: <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/227151/">habrahabr.ru/post/227151/#comment_7713607</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/227151/">https://habr.com/ru/post/227151/</a></p>
