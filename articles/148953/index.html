Now owners of mobile devices on <b>WP7</b> platform will be able to work with the judicial practice of arbitration courts and courts of general jurisdiction, as well as with documents of federal legislation! <br><br><h5>  Today the ATP application ‚Äú <a href="http://docs.pravo.ru/">Pravo.ru</a> ‚Äù became available.  You can download the link <a href="http://www.windowsphone.com/ru-RU/apps/cdbfa6db-4886-495c-bfe7-d0f2bd370c08">www.windowsphone.com/en-RU/apps/cdbfa6db-4886-495c-bfe7-d0f2bd370c08</a> </h5><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/31c/924/c9a/31c924c9a4a35ef7127bf0f088e1b5a6.png"><br>  We tried to make the most functional and convenient application that would be useful both for a student and a practicing lawyer.  The development of the first version of <a href="http://docs.pravo.ru/">Pravo.ru</a> for Windows Phone 7 was not easy in terms of application requirements and direct implementation in design and technical parts.  But first things first. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Each company has its own processes.  In our team - complete creative freedom with personal responsibility for the result.  The mood to ensure that the result of your work suited you as a developer by at least 99% and fully satisfied with the chief designer.

      It is this approach that is practiced in the development of Pravo.ru ATP applications.  Each participant is sick of what he does, and is obliged to communicate closely (and sometimes - ‚Äúbite‚Äù strongly) with all the other sides of the product creation process, which keeps everyone in good shape.  So it was this time.  There was no such thing ‚ÄúI‚Äôll draw now, they will do it‚Äù, or ‚ÄúI‚Äôll write now and they will redraw it‚Äù, or ‚ÄúI‚Äôll plan it now, let them do it as they please‚Äù.  Of course, in Parcsis, traditionally everything comes from design, but a ‚Äúcompromise‚Äù was reached. <br><br>  With regards to the technical part - the disputes were serious.  The requirements for the application were not so simple.  The main difficulty was that Azure with caching on the phone did not quite fit.  We need to store a lot and locally. <br><br>  <a href="http://sqlitewindowsphone.codeplex.com/releases">SQL Lite</a> in the port on WP did not support Unicode in queries (I gave, of course, but you can't build Where to build with Cyrillic) and it also didn‚Äôt work very well.  Conducted experiments with NOSQL subset of databases available for the platform, in particular with <a href="http://sterling.codeplex.com/">Sterling</a> .  The stuff is good, powerful, but bulky in large volumes, and the indices are slow.  The main problem Sterling was that everything in it was stored in a huge number of files in ISO, and the operations of accessing files in it are very expensive. <br><br>  In the end, stopped at <a href="http://www.mcobject.com/perst_eval">Perst</a> .  He solved our storage problem and pleased us with the prospect of selective local full-text indexing of documents. <br><br>  Here is what happened: <br><br><h5>  Arbitrage practice </h5><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/dff/d60/614/dffd60614c4269170b2cbe8a24b61521.png"><br>  Using the application, you can work with judicial practice.  Open the judicial acts of arbitration courts and courts of general jurisdiction immediately from the search result.  To do this, specify the rule of law of interest, and then go to the appropriate category of documents. <br><br><h5>  Quick access to documents </h5><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/468/17e/77c/46817e77c825f7d7fa45cf94c50dd012.png"><br>  Save the necessary documents in the "Favorites", and at any time you can quickly go to their text from the main screen of the application. <br><br><h5>  Work offline </h5><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/d5a/89e/be5/d5a89ebe5c1664ee92dba8bd26224180.png"><br>  The Constitution, codes, federal laws, as well as selected documents are stored locally and are available for viewing without an Internet connection. <br><br><h5>  Easy document navigation </h5><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/ec6/45b/dd3/ec645bdd3f0cb580229f8b27f8678f77.png"><br>  Go to the desired article by dialing its number.  If you do not know the number or you need all the parts with specific text, use the document search.  You can also bookmark the text of the document to quickly jump to the marked parts. <br><br>  This is not our first project on WP7, but the Pravo.ru SPS turned out to be one of the most difficult, but therefore one of the most interesting, since the platform had the most different nuances on it.  In addition, MS conducted a thorough review so that WP7 users get a really high-quality and stable application.  As we said earlier, we have been going through an approval process for quite a long time.  For the most part, this was due to the UI, the location of various elements, buttons, and display of documents.  In this regard, we will welcome your feedback on the work of the application and its design.  Stay tuned for app updates. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/148953/">https://habr.com/ru/post/148953/</a></p>
