Management is forced to focus on information and provide itself with efficient and productive information tools and technologies in order to maintain and develop competitive positions in established and emerging markets. <br><br>  Informatization of the economy makes it possible to develop its efficiency due to a more accurate and reasonable formulation of alternative solutions and a conscious choice of the most effective of them.  The transformation of the ‚Äúpower management‚Äù model into the ‚Äúinformation management‚Äù model is gradually taking place. <br><br>  In continuation of the <a href="https://megamozg.ru/post/24592/">publication of three important factors that make modern management change</a> , we will look at some examples of what areas of development are opening up to economic actors. <br><a name="habracut"></a>

    <h1>  Torrents and copyright </h1><br>  Differently evaluate the moral and ethical side of the distribution of copyright works through torrents or other open network storages.  However, the fact that a direct prohibition and blocking cannot cope with this phenomenon becomes more and more distinct.  The economic damage to a particular business from the uncontrolled distribution of the author's product can be significant.  Copyright holders are protected by different methods, depending on the type and format of their product and potential consumers: from ‚Äúshareware‚Äù versions, to special service paid support and additional benefits (bonuses). <br>  In any case, certain concessions to consumers have to be made and look for recipes rather than in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãprohibitions and restrictions on the dissemination of information based on the unshakable positions of the owner, but in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãflexible and compromise management of information flows. <br>  The search for the best option for the implementation of copyrights and the products that are based on them is one of the directions for the development of modern economic relations, the task of which is to determine not only a decent remuneration, but also the best channels for providing products to consumers. <br>  Single message value <br>  Popular in the global network are now becoming after one video.  Business is destroyed by one publication.  Hidden advertising profitably done in social networks.  PR-motives create bright messages sometimes not relevant to reality. <br>  In the global information economic space, it is necessary to attack and actively defend.  Public companies have to reckon with this.  And the bill goes to billions of dollars, which are invested in tracking market preferences and reputation indicators, creating professional marketing teams and finding new ways to interact with the market, developing competitive strategies and creatively shooting provocative and counter-provocative video clips.  The role of creative communication agencies is increasing, and direct and affordable advertising has less and less effect. <br><br>  <i>Business in anticipation of new technologies of mass communications, in anticipation of creative solutions and convincing for the consumer ways of transmitting information.</i>  <i>Information richness and the desire to protect business interests will gradually lead to a more honest and pragmatic position of economic entities in the market.</i>  <i>Distortion of facts will be less and less useful, and the opposition of regulators and competitors will not allow even in the short term to obtain significant benefits from hiding the key consumer properties of goods, works or services.</i> <br><br><h1>  We regulate knowledge </h1><br>  The flow of information contributes to its constant accumulation and the development of new practically applicable knowledge.  In the sphere of economic relations, companies are no longer able to carry out lengthy evidence-based procedures for the formation of truly fundamental concepts and theories with their subsequent statistical and functional verification.  Actively use new experiences and new ideas, try and make mistakes, but find advantages in completely contradictory facts and events - this is how business works more and more consciously.  Theorization and proof of knowledge will go into the practical plane of their regulation for the short term.  If it became clear that a certain chain of actions is successful, then there is nothing more profitable than immediately fixing it for execution.  There is no need to do much research when tuning and optimization is done during regular work.  For the practice of management, the value of research and consulting services in their classical sense is partially lost.  Become a priority to intensively change when obtaining key evidence of the effectiveness of specific practical solutions. <br><br>  <i>An economy in which information quickly and qualitatively changes a business, it is important to have a special kind of consulting services: system management of knowledge and experience in a particular subject area.</i> <br><br><h1>  Application service </h1><br>  The calmness of the companies providing passenger transportation services has been violated by Uber.  It is a clear and understandable case when a business operating on the basis of the ‚Äúpower management‚Äù model has encountered a new competitor implementing the ‚Äúinformation management‚Äù model.  A company like Uber or Yandex.Taxi does not provide anything so special to partners and customers, except for valuable relevant information.  Somehow it happened that there is no need to have a solid staff of drivers, a garage, vehicles, licenses and other resources or capital to manage transport services and extract profit from it. <br>  Closely and clearly, the business saw a new technology: the effective time-based use of labor, material and financial resources to carry out specific orders for specific consumers and only on the skillful management of key information.  The principle of "all in rent" increases its influence and confirms its effectiveness. <br><br>  <i>Satisfying the need for a client's incoming request based on the rapid formation of a pool of resources from among the available and implementation of the relevant regulated business processes is a very promising way of developing a particular type of business.</i>  <i>In addition to crowdsourcing and crowdfunding, powerful <b>crowdservice</b> is a service based on generalized tangible, intangible and financial resources for any consumer based on various alternative business process models.</i> <br><br>  The economy of goods is being transformed in the direction of the economy of services, and producers of goods are moving into the category of service packers.  How to deal with the inherent sense of ownership and ownership of exclusive things?  Replace them with a sense of superb experience.  In the service economy, status is participation in a flight on a suborbital spacecraft, and not the possession of a fashionable sports car. <br><br><h1>  Robotization: revolution is postponed? </h1><br>  The widespread seizure of jobs by robots in the near future may be at risk of banal management problems.  Building a coherent production process based on robotic systems requires a bit more effort than it seems at first glance.  The reason, of course, is not the complexity of the production and implementation of technological and error-free robots in the technological cycles.  The reason is that the robot cannot ignore or correct the orders issued to it.  To build business processes that will be executed by algorithm-dependent mechanisms requires a damn ability to model processes accurately and in detail.  Note that often the robots in the enterprise are surrounded by the caring hands of engineering and technical specialists who constantly set them up, reprogram them and serve them.  Such professionals act as a stabilizing link between top-management solutions and real-world capabilities of programmable hardware.  The situation is similar when using information technology for automation.  No business can normally use automated control systems in one way or another without recourse to the services of those professionals who are able to transform a complex reality into fixed software algorithms. <br>  The employee in his place can not only follow the instructions of the manager for the pre-installed algorithms, but also correct his execution.  He has the experience and skills to give feedback.  Ignoring the inadequate decisions of a higher management can be useful for business in certain cases.  A significant number of routine procedures are already performed today by robots or robotic complexes.  But a complete transition to a closed robotic cycle without an understanding of all the features associated with this by the management team is impossible. <br><br>  <i>The development of a special type of production based on the processes performed by robots is effective in fairly narrow production operations.</i>  <i>In this sense, it is advantageous to create customized production and technical platforms that are ready for specific orders to carry out special operations for the manufacture, assembly or packaging.</i>  <i>Highly specialized, but highly efficient production services are able to concentrate and develop a resource base with a minimum composition of robots and relevant specialists.</i> <br><br><h1>  Thing as an independent network object </h1><br>  Computerization has reached individual objects, which can be allowed autonomy in behavior.  The Internet of Things is supported by large market players and is greatly encouraged by experts.  But business faces new challenges and challenges in this regard.  Efficient organization of interaction of objects within a controlled network is an order of magnitude more difficult.  There are certain similarities with robotization and total automation of production and technological processes. <br>  The Internet of things has a certain confusion in understanding its informational essence.  It seems that it is all about smart objects, equipped with sensors and controlled from a distance.  But the essence lies in the complex information tools and technology management of a variety of objects included in a single working space of the business model. <br><br>  <i>Special methods of removing detailed telemetry, monitoring the technical condition of the most complex production complexes, forecasting deviations from standard values ‚Äã‚Äãand predicting the occurrence of risk events, operational coordination and synchronization of objects, total dynamic visualization of processes, support for strategic and operational decisions - this and much more is the essence of the potential capabilities internet of things.</i> <br><br><h1>  Automation of business processes </h1><br>  Under the conditions of active information pressure on business processes, the need for flexible and convenient modeling tools is increasing.  Such tools can be compared in part with special software development tools. <br>  Business modeling tools are now required in a slightly different form with full productive support for the life cycle of business objects and business processes.  Possibly, variants of business model notation or special ‚Äúmodeling languages‚Äù will be developed, which are supported by modeling standards, application libraries (business modeling frameworks). <br>  A number of business processes can be standardized without losing competitive advantages within a specific industry or target area.  In this case, the development of a service for ‚Äúsupplying business model fragments‚Äù with elements of complex ‚Äútemplate‚Äù design and block embedding into the general business circuit, with their subsequent automation, updating, control and adjustment is obvious. <br><br>  <i>Informatization of the economy forces businesses to turn to productive means of automating standard and special business processes.</i>  <i>If large companies can afford programming such systems from scratch, then for medium and small businesses ready-made solutions should appear based on business process design patterns and convenient information tools.</i> <br><br><h1>  Virtual Information Operator </h1><br>  Since the information is of great value for a successful business, there must be services that provide a certain set of services for its accumulation, transformation and issuance upon request (request).  But it should be not just IT solutions based on technologies identical to ‚Äúcloud‚Äù, but full sets of services targeted by the goals and objectives of the clients.  The most beneficial for business is the sharing of knowledge, regulations, big data, prototypes, business processes, patents, copyright and related rights, or another type of public or private information.  Information communities within one operator can form public space and implement research projects.  Additional attention should be paid to open and partially limited registries of acquired protected rights and certified attributes. <br>  Information exchange between partners, publication of information, storage and indexing of various data and information, integrity monitoring, protection against distribution and reservation, construction and processing of complex queries, distributed computing ‚Äî professionals are needed to manage this functionality, including within an individual business. <br><br>  <i>The information operator is a service business for collecting, processing, storing, visualizing and distributing information of various types and purposes.</i> <br><br><h1>  Real logistic operator </h1><br>  In an economy that is increasingly moving into virtualization mode, key decisions are required in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãtime-based access to resources, including the movement of real goods (goods, works, services).  Even more important, along with the effective delivery of information to the consumer, will be comfortable, high-quality and fast movement of finished products and their components.  And if the object is provided to the consumer for temporary use, then the object must be returned to the owner. <br>  Transportation is necessary for both tangible objects and intangible products that are physically packed (for example, a movie on a blu-ray disc).  Virtual transportation is another separate direction within which successful business schemes (for example, file exchangers) are possible. <br>  Transport service conditions largely depend on the chosen strategy and business tactics.  Variants are allowed, both in the format of the ‚Äúcoordinator‚Äù of vehicles, consignors and consignees, and in the format of its own high-capacity logistics network. <br><br>  <i>The transport operator is a service business for the optimization of routes of movement and the direct movement of material resources and products between economic entities.</i> <br><br><a name="finoper"></a><br><h1>  Convenient financial operator </h1><br>  In a sense, banking services are no longer flexible and convenient for an actively developing economy.  Informatization frees up and redistributes resources, changes the ways and processes of managing companies, generates new forms of labor relations.  Finance is a sector of the economy for which the potential for the development of information technologies in the context of globalization of digital data is very high.  Today, an individual and a legal entity need more than just lending and depositing money.  It is realistic to develop a financial service that will receive, control and distribute income from various sources, coordinate rational reservation, saving and risk insurance, automatically plan the basic budget (expenses) and create funds for current mandatory expenses and development, make direct payments and payments "with confirmation", will take on continuous monitoring of financial flows in order to eliminate unfavorable situations of cash deficit.  But all this is in terms of confidentiality and mobility, and possibly in the framework of a special cryptocurrency. <br><br>  <i>A financial operator is a service business for regulated integrated management of private or corporate finance in a safe and mobile mode, including revenue and expenditure parts.</i> <br><br><h1>  Manufacturer of information on needs, products and customers </h1><br>  In the modern economy, which is characterized by global informatization, trade (or, if you prefer, the system of sales) is also gradually changing.  The forms and types of business deals, not to mention the assortment and variety of points of sale, are impressive.  What does ‚Äútrade‚Äù turn into?  What becomes the main thing in its functions: transport networks and logistics for goods, a marketing meeting of a product with a consumer, turnover and margin of a retail outlet, and a cheerful pastime for buyers? <br><br>  <i>Trade is transformed into a primary producer of information on needs, customers and trade transactions.</i>  <i>This is perhaps the most valuable resource for the economy as a whole and for any production in particular.</i>  <i>The consumer is directly involved in trade transactions, which means that this is a really important moment when you can study its characteristics and attributes of behavior.</i> <br><br>  Indeed, for example, what is ... <br>  ... the assortment benefit of large retail chains compared to small stores - how not a wealth of information about a variety of products and the ability to meet the needs in the place of active sales; <br>  ... display of the goods of impulse demand in the cash zone - as no additional accompanying information for the consumer that he could forget to meet ‚Äúsmall needs‚Äù and a reminder of such needs; <br>  ... promotions and discounts - if not information about the benefits for the consumer when buying certain goods under certain conditions; <br>  ... discount and loyalty programs - if not information about the benefits for regular and important customers; <br>  ... merchandising - as not profitable placement of information about products in the field of view of consumers; <br>  ... e-commerce is not a convenient high-tech and competitive provision of information about products and opportunities for a trade transaction. <br>  Trading networks have already begun to feel their ‚Äúinformational‚Äù power before manufacturers, therefore, certain methods have emerged to extract economic benefits from this (for example, a marketing fee). <br><br><h1>  Management of risks </h1><br>  Economic entities are exposed to a variety of risks in their activities.  And this list is constantly expanding and will expand as a result of the increasing complexity of the technologies and technological tools used, as well as as a result of all the intensive and close interaction of the subjects.  Today, every business depends not only on itself, but also on many other businesses.  If a company does not want to lose everything overnight and face the insurmountable consequences of an extraordinary event, it must conceive and defend against the most probable and destructive risks.  Alone, no business can handle. <br>  Not every company can afford to have in its structure professional risk managers who could stop a business from a line beyond which the risk is unreasonably great.  And if a business is built on its basis not on material assets, but on ideas and knowledge, then risk management is an important point not only for its growth, but also, first of all, for self-preservation. <br>  You can lose a business in a matter of days as a result of various unpredictable or poorly predictable events.  And significant damage can significantly slow down the development of the company or weaken its position by allowing competitors to take over the market share.  In such cases, the business needs help. <br>  The modern economy must offer competent risk management centers that have knowledge (relevant information and professional experience), tools (methods and technologies to prevent, eliminate, compensate for risks and recover from risk events), training programs and ‚Äúproducts‚Äù (understandable, monetized and satisfying customers ‚Äôrisk management needs). <br><br>  <i>The Risk Management Center is a competent business for the provision of services (of various levels and details) for risk management for a specific range of economic entities, including: risk classification, analysis and forecasting, risk event management, mitigation, recovery.</i> <br><br>  PS Of course the list is not exhaustive.  Your ideas and suggestions in the comments. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/299198/">https://habr.com/ru/post/299198/</a></p>
