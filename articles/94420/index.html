A task that deserves respect and every kind of support, in my opinion. <br>  Under the cut a few photos from the conference and my impressions of her. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br> <a href="http://img-fotki.yandex.ru/get/4303/silentimp.3/0_2daa4_e0f68d55_orig"><img src="http://img-fotki.yandex.ru/get/4303/silentimp.3/0_2daa4_e0f68d55_L" alt="Breakfast"></a> <br>  Slowly waiting for registration, and the last edits are made to the report.  Of course, everything is already there ... but I always want to change something, which would turn out even more interesting. <br><br>  At 10 o'clock the pretty girl gives out to everyone who bothered to come up, badges. <br> <a href="http://img-fotki.yandex.ru/get/4301/silentimp.4/0_2daaa_7506e69d_orig" title="Epic awful badge photo"><img src="http://img-fotki.yandex.ru/get/4301/silentimp.4/0_2daaa_7506e69d_M" alt="Epic awful badge photo"></a> <br><br>  Slowly everyone began to pull up to the hall.  At 11:00 wsd began.

    <h4>  Reports </h4><br><h5>  Opening of the conference and the report ‚ÄúWeb Layout in Latvia: Yesterday.  Today!  Tomorrow?" </h5><br>  <i>Nikita Seletsky</i> <br>  Nikita Seletsky, one of the conference organizers, took the floor.  He also had the first report.  We heard about the state of affairs with standards support in Latvia.  Nikita analyzed the websites of conference participants from Latvia.  The number of them exceeded a hundred.  I scolded developers who ignore UTF-8 and hinted that validation is not done at all for a tick, but a well-formed document is a necessary, but not sufficient, property to conform to standards.  And after that, he threatened to come and check whether the participants would correct their sites for the better.  It was interesting.  Great entry.  Even despite the fact that the representativeness of Nikita‚Äôs sample caused doubts among some of the conference participants. <br><br>  Report: <a href="http://seleckis.lv/journal/research/vyorstka-v-latvii-vchera-segodnya-zavtra">seleckis.lv/journal/research/vyorstka-v-latvii-vchera-segodnya-zavtra</a> <br><br><h5>  Features of creating web sites for mobile devices </h5><br>  <i>Dmitry Dulepov</i> <br>  Dmitry Dulepov is a freelance with serious experience.  The report was interesting and listened to him in total silence, afraid to miss even a word. <br> <a href="http://img-fotki.yandex.ru/get/4208/silentimp.3/0_2daa5_dac7160f_orig"><img src="http://img-fotki.yandex.ru/get/4208/silentimp.3/0_2daa5_dac7160f_L" alt="Dmitry Dulepov"></a> <br> <a href="http://img-fotki.yandex.ru/get/4301/silentimp.3/0_2daa6_6912e7d0_orig"><img src="http://img-fotki.yandex.ru/get/4301/silentimp.3/0_2daa6_6912e7d0_L" alt="Everyone listens to Dmitry in mute, ecstatic delight."></a> <br>  We heard about the growth trends in the number of mobile users, convenient interfaces for smartphones, which browsers are being used and which ones are most likely to gain popularity in the future. <br>  The truth is, Dmitry works with the Western market and not all of what he said is applicable for the CIS.  With us, for example, the production of apple and the safari installed on it do not rush to occupy a leading position, and the opera mini is quite popular.  A little upset that in his work is completely absent such a wonderful thing as media-query.  When describing the devices on which he orients himself, media-query simply suggests itself in its work. <br><br>  Report: <a href="">webstandardsdays.ru/2010/05/22/2.mobile.webdev.zip</a> <br><br><h5>  HTML5 and CSS3.  The evolution of web standards </h5><br>  This is my report. <br>  I planned to attend the conference as a listener, but it turned out that at the last moment I was a speaker.  I hope that my report was useful to someone.  Despite the fact that the preparation time turned out to be very little and I changed some of the slides just before the conference, I tried very hard for the report to be spectacular and informative. <br>  He briefly talked about HTML5 and CSS3, without, however, mentioning the topic of new and undoubtedly interesting APIs.  Despite the fact that many people were puzzled, I think that the discussion of video, audio, canvas, geolocation, web sockets and much more deserves a separate report.  And most likely not one. <br><br>  Report: <a href="http://nightfolk.net/portfolio/wsd/index.html">nightfolk.net/portfolio/wsd/index.html</a> <i>(Erase in the last Safari, after loading click "tab")</i> <br><br><h5>  CSS management.  Three years later </h5><br>  <i>Vadim Makeev</i> <br>  The report raised the issue of organizing CSS project files and CSS post-release.  Concerned questions of hacks and unexpected glitches.  Excellent report, as always.  On the sidelines, subsequently, one of the organizers called it the most interesting and practical from a practical point of view of all the reports of the conference.  Deserved.  Although in my work I still consider it necessary on the developer version, even in small projects, to divide CSS into blocks from the point of view of semantics and put them into separate files instead of using comments in CSS files that once awarded me with a lot of problems. <br><br>  Report: <a href="http://pepelsbey.net/pres/css-management/">pepelsbey.net/pres/css-management</a> <br><br><h5>  Developer Tools - Which Is Tastier? </h5><br>  <i>Mikhail Baranov</i> <br>  To my great surprise, we were told in some detail about how to use firebug and what alternatives it has in other browsers.  Um  I did not learn anything new for myself, but judging by the fact that they reacted very vividly to the report and with genuine interest for many it was a day of revelations.  I think now, with firebug, the Latvian web will now become even better and this thought warms my soul. <br><br>  Report: <a href="">webstandardsdays.ru/2010/05/22/5.extensions.zip</a> <br><br><h5>  Lean Startup.  From idea to million. </h5><br>  <i>Maxim Bereza</i> <br> <a href="http://img-fotki.yandex.ru/get/4207/silentimp.3/0_2daa7_ca1705e_orig"><img src="http://img-fotki.yandex.ru/get/4207/silentimp.3/0_2daa7_ca1705e_L" alt="Mom, what was that ?!"></a> <br>  The first thing that Maxim Bereza reported about was that he was born Dots, who were present in the hall with his mother.  And for this barcamp did not take place.  Then I did not particularly listen.  Too bad was Russian, too messy, for me, the story.  I liked one of the tweets about this report: ‚ÄúLean Startup Report: Mom, what was that ?!‚Äù. <br>  Well ... congratulations on the docea.  Baby is very cool.  For good I envy.  And I have nothing more to add. <br><br>  Report: <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/torbjon/lean-startup-wsd">www.slideshare.net/torbjon/lean-startup-wsd</a> <br><br><h5>  Round table ‚ÄúWeb standards vs.  Rich Internet Applications </h5><br>  <i>Vadim Makeev, Nikita Seletsky</i> <br>  First, holivaril about what "Rich Internet Applications". <br>  Then - which is better: Web standards or Flash. <br>  It is expected to conclude that: <br><ul><li>  Apple - assholes and in general it's all mutual PR Apple and Adobe </li><li>  On flash, you can write good applications, if you understand what it is to write on it and rearrange the hands from the fifth point a little higher </li><li>  HTML5 with its canvas, video, audio and many wonderful api will force out flash in most areas.  Absolutely, in my opinion, deservedly </li><li>  Right now, this will not happen immediately and instantly, since HTML5, canvas and the company are still too raw and there are no decent development tools.  For example, an alternative to the Flash development environment for working with canvas and at least tentatively comparable capabilities.  But not much time will pass and nowhere else will we see the flash menu (Hooray, comrades!) And now we can switch to html5 and Google-open video codec. </li></ul><br><br><h4>  Pleasant conversation. </h4><br>  And after that there was a nice chat in private in a small coffee shop, which was hidden between a very touching house where the museum of architecture was located and a narrow street of whores.  They served beer with a scoop and garlic in tomato sauce, croutons with garlic, which were supposed to smear garlic oil and pour garlic gravy.  The most incredible thing was that it was delicious.  Highly.  Even better than gray peas and bread soup with whipped cream.  Yes. <br>  Unhurried conversation about interesting projects and development paradigms, methods of organizing these projects and the nature of bad code.  It gave me a lot of new ideas.  I don‚Äôt even know where I got them more: in the hall, listening attentively to the speakers or slowly talking to them over a glass of mulled wine.  But anyway: it was great. <br> <a href="http://img-fotki.yandex.ru/get/4305/silentimp.3/0_2daa8_ba919c59_orig"><img src="http://img-fotki.yandex.ru/get/4305/silentimp.3/0_2daa8_ba919c59_L" alt="A pleasant ending to a pleasant evening."></a> <br><br><h4>  Additional materials </h4><br><ul><li>  <a href="http://webstandardsdays.ru/">webstandardsdays.ru</a> - Conference dedicated website </li><li>  <a href="http://web-standards.ru/">web-standards.ru</a> - Website of the Russian-speaking wing of the Web Standards Group </li><li>  <a href="http://seleckis.lv/journal/research/vyorstka-v-latvii-vchera-segodnya-zavtra">seleckis.lv/journal/research/vyorstka-v-latvii-vchera-segodnya-zavtra</a> - report by Nikita Seletsky </li><li>  <a href="http://pepelsbey.net/pres/css-management/">pepelsbey.net/pres/css-management</a> - Presentation of CSS Management by Vadim Makeev </li><li>  <a href="http://nightfolk.net/portfolio/wsd/index.html">nightfolk.net/portfolio/wsd/index.html</a> - My presentation.
