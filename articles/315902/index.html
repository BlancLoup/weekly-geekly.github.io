To share numerous updates of our portfolio during this time, our vision of IT trends and experience in implementing solutions, we have planned a new series of webinars.  In addition, we want to hear your opinion on the topics of the following webinars, events and publications, and award the authors of the most interesting comments with a useful prize (spoiler: this is not a cup). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/478/f85/744/478f85744690badfc7332a13bf4cc805.jpg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The first <a href="http://p.brighttalk.com/hpe/ru/%3Fcommid%3D229955%26utm_source%3Dsm%26utm_medium%3Dpost%26utm_campaign%3Dhabr"><b>webinar in this series - on updates to the HPE Aruba and Mobile First network networking solutions portfolio</b></a> - has already taken place, but is available on record.  As part of this webinar, we reviewed: <br><br><ul><li>  trends in the mobile device management market and how it is worth changing the company's development strategy depending on them; </li><li>  New infrastructure and platform Aruba Mobile First network, as well as a broad ecosystem of partners; </li><li>  areas of application of the platform and infrastructure products of the company, including adaptability for the requirements of digital collaboration technology, optimization of the branch infrastructure, expansion of network security policies and the use of location services. </li></ul><br>  <a href="http://p.brighttalk.com/hpe/ru/%3Fcommid%3D224553%26utm_source%3Dsm%26utm_medium%3Dpost%26utm_campaign%3Dhabr"><b>The HPE StoreVirtual 3200 and MSA 2042 webinar</b></a> , which will be held on November 30th, is dedicated to the next generation of entry-level storage devices.  They are designed to solve typical problems of a small enterprise, such as mail, 1C, file storage, and do not require additional technical tools and financial costs.  Using examples, we show how to optimize data storage in a limited budget and state setting and allow IT staff to focus on long-term planning, rather than on operational management.
