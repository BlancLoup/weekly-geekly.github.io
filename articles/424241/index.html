At the same time, add-ons should not ‚Äúeat up‚Äù too many resources, because changes in the modern world occur quickly and often. <br><br>  The desire to give unique features to what surrounds us, first of all, affects the house.

      Most of the time we spend in the room where we live or work.  We influence the place, and certainly the environment affects us.  Often, not only our well-being, but also our mood, and therefore our performance, often depends on them.  By creating around him a reality that is to his liking, a person does everything more efficiently, with greater dedication, especially if intellectual and creative resources are needed in the work. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/5w/y_/i5/5wy_i5adfqczupjtgvrvvewk2fk.jpeg"><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h3>  Digital printing </h3><br>  Due to the fact that the level of development of modern technologies blurs the line between various industries, today in the design world innovations are taking place that create new trends. <br><br>  Digital and 3D printing come to the aid of traditional decor solutions.  They allow the use of approaches that were previously impossible, or the cost of their implementation was extremely high.  The design becomes personalized, created for individual needs. <br><br>  The main part of digital printing in the design accounts for the creation of various coatings, where printing on textiles can also be attributed, which is eloquently confirmed by numbers. <br><br>  By 2024, the volume of the digital printing market in Europe alone, according to experts, will grow by 200 percent and reach 121 billion.  Two-fold growth will be possible through the use of this technology in the production of decor. <br><br>  A similar situation in the segment of industrial and functional printing - an increase from 67 billion USD to 107 billion USD. <br><br>  What makes digital printing solutions in demand? <br><br>  First of all, they can very authentically imitate natural materials, differing favorably, of course, in price.  This is important for those who want to create a certain image of the house, but believes that natural materials are too expensive. <br><br>  In addition, these technologies are highly economical - if any part of the coating is damaged, you can print a new replacement fragment that is identical to the original. <br><br>  Accordingly, when using digital printing, designers have the opportunity to implement the most ambitious designs.  The selection of materials is no longer so critical - everything you need can be created from a digital file. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/kd/24/zg/kd24zg7laapw_1qzryw-htu1naq.jpeg"><br><br>  With the introduction of new technologies using digital printing, it became possible not only to seal sheet material, but also to apply images to various objects of complex shape.  A relief printing technology, developed by Canon Oc√©, allows you to transfer a drawing and surface texture.  It can be used to create decorative coatings and to print realistic copies of paintings, where everything is reliably transmitted - right up to cracks in the paint. <br><br>  Today, a unique perspective opens up for digital print service providers.  A person‚Äôs desire to have a space that reflects his individuality, be it upholstered furniture, wallpaper, glass, ceramics or laminate, stimulates spending resources on highly personalized interior elements.  This began to take into account leading companies specializing in the production of furniture and home decor.  They use digital printing to customize batch products.  To understand the prospects of digital printing services just look at the statistics.  So, in 2015, only the European market for online sales of home furniture was estimated at 30 billion EUR, and the expected global market for home decor by 2020 is likely to reach 664 billion USD.  And this is just the beginning. <br><br>  Designers can combine digital printing with other advanced technologies, pursuing interesting creative solutions that have great practical potential. <br><br>  For example, based on the characteristics of the room, you can create a unique design of stained glass windows, combining the light transmission, color and location of the picture. <br><br>  The wide palette available for digital printing allows you to use any number of colors. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/iw/5m/34/iw5m34918ei17dwbzbvmtdfuxno.jpeg"><br><br><h3>  3D printing </h3><br>  The advent of 3D printing has had a huge impact on various areas of production.  The volume of global spending on 3D printers from 2015 to 2018 has increased almost tenfold - from 1.6 billion USD to 13.4 billion USD (according to Gartner).  In the future, one of the main uses for 3D printing, according to PwC forecasts, will be the independent printing of home decor. <br>  3D printing radically changes the working methods of manufacturing and engineering companies, and also offers a wide range of possibilities for creative industries. <br><br>  The development of technology makes 3D printers more accessible to ordinary users, while improving quality and reducing printing costs.  All this allows designers to experiment with new combinations of materials, new forms and designs. <br>  3D printing is already widely used in the design and manufacture of furniture, lighting and decorative ornaments, both for commercial and home interiors. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/d4/e5/q_/d4e5q_ddp33wgvf5c2z1nd-bcsk.jpeg"><br><br>  As an example, lighting designer Robert Deban.  It uses 3D printing to complement traditional printing methods.  This allows him to emphasize the mosaic and geometric patterns in each of his modern designs.  This combination of traditional and 3D printing is also ideal for creating unique, personalized items. <br><br>  3D printing allows people to add individuality to any object, from furniture to accessories.  There is a tendency of transition from standardized design projects for mass production, developed by professional designers, to individual creativity of users who create their own personal space. <br><br><h3>  Wide Format Printers </h3><br>  The locomotive of using large format printing is the market of decorative textiles, decorative laminate and wall coverings. <br><br>  In turn, large format printing can truly help in meeting the mass demand for individual products that prevails in today's market. <br><br>  Digital printing has made a major contribution to the possibility of individualizing the space.  Its advantages, such as small print runs and personalization, allow ordinary customers and corporate clients to give their home or office a unique look - from eco-friendly graphics for hotel halls and retail showrooms to creating specialized building materials such as marbled wall panels. <br>  According to the Canon Think Personal report, large format printing also simplified production processes and optimized productivity and workflow quality. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/3b/jx/yg/3bjxyg1yl5uq4tyswsqr0ovzxro.jpeg"><br><br>  Today there is no shortage of web-based solutions, print-on-demand solutions that allow creative clients to express themselves in a unique way.  Software development allows you to individualize products using images or content without special skills, and also supports the growing trend of self-selection of content when customers develop their products themselves. <br>  New connections between physical and digital products are developing, which makes the market even more dynamic.  With remote printing solutions, you can personalize the service even more. <br><br><h3>  Prospects for digital printing </h3><br>  To understand the potential of this sphere, we turn to numbers. <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ In 2008, the inkjet market was less than 5% of industrial printing; <br>  ‚Ä¢ in 2012 it already exceeded 19%; <br>  ‚Ä¢ in 2018, an increase of more than 30%. <br><br>  The main potential of this market segment lies in the range, which has no clear boundaries.  The emergence of new products and services depends largely on creativity and creative tasks.  Experiments with new materials and printing technologies can give new directions in creating a decor.  Thus, the use of digital technology has allowed to revive the ancient art of wooden mosaic, dating back to the 16th century, when artists applied thin pieces of wood on the base, creating decorative patterns, drawings and paintings.  High-quality effects can be created using textures derived from several layers, ink, varnishes or special effects processing. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/gn/jv/uw/gnjvuwudxtuf7tzzgj-qmvvbrue.jpeg"><br><br>  Technology for printing and modern equipment make it possible to create inspiring people samples.  The result is limited only by your imagination.  You can safely experiment, realize creative potential. <br><br>  Choice, self-expression, individuality - this is something that is appreciated in the modern world, and a product or service is only an expression of one or another value that is important for a person. <br>  For our part, we are ready to advise on one of the industry‚Äôs largest range of printing products - from roll and sheet industrial printers, flatbed UV printers and trimming systems to water-based inkjet printing systems, a unique CrystalPoint system and one-pass systems. <br><br>  Inspire yourself and others with new features that modern technology provides. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/424241/">https://habr.com/ru/post/424241/</a></p>
