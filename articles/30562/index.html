  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Adult maturity (s)</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Hello, dear users!  Today we would like to tell you about <a href="http://www.smart-masses.ru/">SmartMasses</a> - our store for adult children and geeks. <br><br><h1>  How it all began </h1><br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Once, together with my friends and partners, the three of us gathered in a cafe to discuss the details of the project that we were then developing.  In a lyrical pause for a cup of tea, Aleksandr Aleksandrovich started talking about a business idea that had occurred to him the other day.  He began by saying that he needed to buy a gift for his friend and IT colleague, and with this problem he came to Google.  Google did not give a clear answer to the requests to advise the ‚Äúgift to the sysadmin‚Äù, ‚Äúgift to the computer programmer‚Äù and so on.  Alexander Alexandrovich became thoughtful and began to search in English-language Google.  The site of the online store <a href="http://www.thinkgeek.com/">thinkgeek.com</a> , widely known in narrow circles, selling gifts, toys and various interesting pieces for the American (mostly) geek public, was quickly found quite quickly.  Alexander Alexandrovich thought for the second time.  Thoughts flew about like this: if they have, then why don't we?  We also have geeks, IT specialists, a young and active intelligentsia ... and there is a lot of it ... With these thoughts, he came to the meeting. 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>
        <script>
          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      The idea was picked up by us and put on a creative stream.  Under this theme, creative popper itself: good ideas were not forced to wait.  We left the cafe with a briefcase of written papers filled with thoughts about how it would be.  In fact, we have already decided everything. <br><br><h1>  Shop for anyone. </h1><br>  We have practically no places where we would work for geeks and geeks.  At the same time, we clearly saw the prospect of such a business.  This is what smart uncles like Kotler call a ‚Äúmarketing opportunity‚Äù: there is a niche, there is demand, and there is practically no infrastructure that would serve this niche.  Filling this niche turned out to be a challenge for us.  And we decided to make the store the first step towards capturing the world :) <br><br><h1>  How we are working. </h1><br>  We work well and a lot.  From the first day of discussion of the draft, a sharp decision was made to work all days of the week, including on holidays.  Since none of us had any experience in retail, we tried to actively feed ourselves from the information field in this field, borrow all the good and sift out everything that was evil.  The result of such a fight with demons are the following things: <br><ul><li>  Ultimate attitude to courier delivery.  The courier always arrives exactly on time.  And if it is late - the client has the opportunity to put a special mark in the courier application form and pay 10% less of the order amount.  In this case, the courier receives a penalty from the store and seeks no more messing around :) </li><li>  Our spirit.  We are the same adult children and smart masses in one person, and we support this spirit. </li><li>  Orientation to the target audience.  We know very well for whom we work, and we understand our audience, because we ourselves are part of it. </li></ul><br><br><h1>  So what we have. </h1><br>  So far we have a shop.  More precisely, not just a store, but a very good store, in which you have to buy things for yourself and presents to everyone else <font>(as if using NLP and hypnosis techniques - touch the screen with your little fingers)</font> .  What is planned: <br><ul><li>  Vishlisty.  A very useful thing for blogging.  Special widgets are planned that can be embedded in the blog; </li><li>  Gift certificates - to delegate the care of choosing a gift to the hero of the occasion :) </li><li>  Modify the functionality of the account; </li><li>  The system of work with discounts: the accumulation of discounts, the possibility of processing discounts in the checkout window, etc .; </li><li>  Increasing the number of photos of goods; </li><li>  Shooting a video about how to play properly with the gadgets that you buy from us <font>(pysch-pysch)</font> . </li></ul><br><br><h1>  While working. </h1><br>  We made friends in the form of a resource <a href="http://www.dvice.ru/">Dvice.ru</a> , on which reviews of our gadgets now appear daily.  After all, if a person reads about a gadget, then sometimes he certainly wants his w00t-urge to materialize on the table. <br><br>  We received an interesting offer from Hacker magazine, so we hope that soon readers of this magazine will be able to see reviews of our gadgets, and we will shine in gloss;) <br><br>  Sliced ‚Äã‚Äã50 square meters of polyethylene with pimples on the squares, convenient for stress relief. <br><br>  And about us wrote an article on <a href="http://artem.grumy.ru/blog/138.html">Groom</a> , UGC-resource dedicated to office culture. <br><br>  What did we ourselves get from working in our store?  A lot of positive :) So many pleasant feelings we did not give any work - then you can be sure.  And we constantly play toys, of necessity and just like that.  And we are building plans on the topic of infrastructure development for geek culture.  But more about that later. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/30562/">https://habr.com/ru/post/30562/</a></p>
