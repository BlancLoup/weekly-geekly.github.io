Any self-respecting large technology company rehearses theatrical performances with light music, where executive directors and head.  departments hone their skills of work in public, memorize texts and movements. <br><br>  In order to color our laborer work days a little in lab9.pro, we, with my colleague Sergey Potapov, decided to compare several leading players in the technology sector in terms of the visual presentation of their latest offers.  Trying to highlight some of the features in their approaches can certainly be seen some individual features in each image.

In the general atmosphere of the event, there were obvious shades of ‚Äústeampunk‚Äù style.  Visitors could plunge into the absorbing spectacle displaying the image of Google - a kind of technological workshop, where experiments and all kinds of experiments are encouraged, and the method of scientific typing is a natural approach to business.  Perhaps most clearly this mentality demonstrates a project called Google Cardboard - the epitome of botanism, allowing people to create their own 3D VR glasses from cardboard paper themselves.  Maybe this kind of self-made looks slightly and coarse, but clearly contributes to the advancement of the overall evolution of technical progress. <br><br>  For the sake of justice, the Google design concept ‚ÄúMaterial design‚Äù adds elegance to the steampunk atmosphere, resulting in a holistic image with futuristic elements - quite characteristic of Google. <br>  You can watch the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3D7V-fIGMDsmE">Google I / O 2015 keynote</a> presentation <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3D7V-fIGMDsmE">on Youtube</a> . <br><br><br><br><hr><br><h1>  Apple - polished diamond </h1><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/31e/dd4/e9a/31edd4e9a9f0341df19cec1ef734c5cd.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Apple is famous for its presentations and style in general.  Their demonstration in March 2016 was relatively modest, so here we will consider the show in September 2015, which was maintained in the best traditions of this technological giant in terms of appearance design - a discreet, dark style visually isolated and emphasized each product, and also contributed to the visual focus of the audience.  The appearance of the guests and presenters also corresponded to the general style - it even seems that all the men on the stage were in uniform - as if the only freedom of choice that they could afford in their clothes was tucked in ‚Äî whether their uniform shirt was in jeans or not. <br><br>  The presentation was ingenuous - well rehearsed and without any special surprises (alas, also without ‚Äúone last thing‚Äù).  As an interesting point, it can be noted that Apple decided to put the intro in the end, completing the presentation with a whole concert from OneRepublic. <br><br>  The dark and discreet visual tone displayed and the presented improvements - in general, everything became a bit larger, thinner, more durable and comfortable, but without any innovative leaps in updates.  The appearance of several invited guests on the stage ‚Äî representatives of medical companies, as well as Adobe and even Microsoft ‚Äî can be considered unusual.  This in turn made it possible to make several interesting shots; <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/091/897/861/091897861877ec000f95c1478c93caa5.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <i>Wait, so whose is this event?</i> <br><br>  In general, the image of the event resembled a well-polished gem exhibited on the counter of a jewelry store - stylish and shiny, appealing to our sense of aesthetics, but without surprises beyond what was expected. <br><br>  Apple presentation, including <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DpILHUqj1TyE">OneRepublic</a> . <br><br><br><br><hr><br><h1>  Microsoft is a friendly future </h1><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b44/5ae/0cc/b445ae0ccdf50dd7f053e64da6f75570.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Microsoft probably does not associate your first place with brilliance and inspiration - the company is better known in terms of performance, numbers and calculations.  Also, everyone probably remembers "and I PC" from the famous commercials "Mac vs. PC", but in October everything was different. <br><br>  CNet called Microsoft's ‚ÄúWindows 10 devices briefing‚Äù presentation ‚Äúthe <a href="http://www.cnet.com/videos/why-microsoft-had-the-best-tech-keynote-of-2015/">best in 2015,</a> ‚Äù and their reasons can be understood.  The shown products presented something new and interesting to the thirsty public, and the general atmosphere of the presentation turned out to be very friendly and open.  Even if only because Microsoft turned the stage into a living room for Hololens, which, by the way, becomes more and more impressive each time. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/4fa/87c/e02/4fa87ce0268562eac6ed7eedd85cfa43.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <i>Maybe it is not so friendly, is this the future?</i>  <i>:)</i> <br><br>  Slightly slowing down in terms of standard corporate slogans, the leaders behaved more relaxed, and did not hesitate to " <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3D3nwPiYUm1OA">be productive as a boss,</a> " or to wear felt hats on stage. <br><br>  Such a sincere, ‚Äúhomely‚Äù tinge of the event was also emphasized by humorous elements in the presentation, for example, when the famous <a href="http://www.winbeta.org/news/microsoft-toaster-fridge-makes-appearance-october-6-hardware-event">hybrid toaster-fridge</a> suddenly appeared on the screen, which even made Panos Paney slightly confused.  In general, the presentation feeling was light, friendly, and simple, and the enthusiasm of the presenters fit well into the big picture.  Of course, in some places it was not without pomposity, but the event tried to give the impression of sincerity, which in our opinion was quite successful. <br>  Here you can learn <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DdmZ3ZhZNSfs">how to escape from the giant robots attacking you</a> from your own walls. <br><br><br><br><hr><br><h1>  Tesla - funny geeks </h1><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e0b/6e0/bfe/e0b6e0bfe52f7420e64e84ca6846f808.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The most technical guys perform at Tesla events.  At the presentation of ‚ÄúModel 3‚Äù on April 1, as well as at the ‚ÄúModel X‚Äù show on September 29 last year, there were many graphs, drawings, diagrams and diagrams.  Also Tesla has the shortest events, just 20-30 minutes in total.  Ilon Musk, as it were, hints: ‚Äúwe don‚Äôt have time for all this, it‚Äôs time for us to go back to work, so many more things ...‚Äù  At a recent demonstration of the Model 3, we actually looked more at the slides than at the car itself, which is why it is more interesting to look at the event of the last year. <br><br>  The announcement of the ‚ÄúModel X‚Äù did without much pomp - the star of the program at one moment simply rolled out onto the stage without special warnings, while Ilon Mask himself was busy with some kind of diagram on the screen.  The camera did not even realize at first what the matter was, drawing attention to the car only when a loud reaction from the public had already told about its arrival. <br><br>  No excessive theatricality, no promises to ‚Äúchange everything that we knew about cars‚Äù - let the product speak for itself better.  With his characteristic humility and geek humor, Ilon presented the latest developments of the company based on figures and data, sometimes even weaving into his presentation all sorts of equations about the relationship between strength and distance - dexterity of sciences and no fraud! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/2da/5d9/b99/2da5d9b9948b4035a5bea69f5ca771af.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <i>Ilon Musk solves very practical problems, just in case ...</i> <br><br>  The presentation style is well illustrated by the demonstration of the ‚ÄúBiological Weapons Protection Mode‚Äù button, which caused loud applause and a burst of laughter from the public.  In general, the event was very positive and authentic - everything is simple and botan, in the good sense of the word. <br><br>  Here you can see how the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DeWIt4Ze7r9Y">Model X goes to the stage for the first time</a> . <br><br><br><br><hr><br><h1>  Adobe - a surge of emotion </h1><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/79e/c31/07c/79ec3107cf60164fd7463deb5b8d3dc7.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The presentation of Adobe Max 2015 took place in early October for several days, and of course the company that currently contributes to generating a significant percentage of creative content around the world tried to amaze us with a real burst of creativity. <br>  The opening of the event made a fantastic visual impression - an explosion of color throughout the scene, 3D effects and dynamic transitions, all under the <a href="https://soundcloud.com/opusorange/stars-collide">energetic music</a> specially written for this event by the Opus Orange group. <br><br>  This event was the longest among all listed here, but the exciting, colorful scene kept the mood of the event at its best, and emphasized the enthusiasm of the leading and invited guests.  The walls, floor and ceiling of the stage - it all turned into one full screen, dynamically changing for each individual story on the stage, emphasizing the mood and atmosphere of events. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/798/00b/2f9/79800b2f94d06852066d59a349b3c03f.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <i>After all, what is technology without emotion, right?</i> <br><br>  The event was attended by so many heavyweights from a variety of creative industries that sometimes an event was more like a TED conference than a technical presentation.  Of course, some parts of the presentation focused on business, demonstrating certain technological aspects and capabilities of the products and services being presented, however, many of the leading and invited guests created their own atmosphere on the stage, with their own personal stories and emotions.  So for example, I would like to mention <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DlO23aHJ2sso">Jason Levin‚Äôs</a> unbridled enthusiasm, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DAn_FCvT2AVc">El Luna‚Äôs</a> sentimental reverie, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3D_rd70CEmr1k">Baz Lurman‚Äôs</a> rapid stream of consciousness.  But these are just a few colorful moments that gave the event a special emotional charm - the presentation looked like a performance in some places. <br><br>  You can see the whole Adobe MAX 2015 event here: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3Dxg9gRD3fR6E">part 1</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DQDP5uxwAI2Y">part 2</a> . <br><br><br><br><hr><br><h1>  Together apart </h1><br><br>  Recently, it may seem that all the major technology companies <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2015/12/28/10645500/2015-tech-year-review-conversation">are trying to be similar to each other</a> , at least in terms of marketing and product development strategies.  Therefore, it is especially pleasant to see such diverse and individual styles of presentations on stage.  These events are the main point of contact between the image of these companies and everyday users, and it‚Äôs good that each of these highly influential giants has their own vision and ideas on this subject, and everyone‚Äôs performance is at a high level. <br><br>  After all, if we talk about global entertainment, then these events are really a kind of circus for the whole world - these technologies are ubiquitous and accessible (and therefore interesting) to each of us.  What else do we need geeks?  But of course - wait for the next new products and new presentations! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/281246/">https://habr.com/ru/post/281246/</a></p>
