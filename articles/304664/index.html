And balance-balance-balance ...</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Let's do it - I will not build from myself a GTD guru and so on.  I am a simple lover of glands, who gets a buzz from writing topics on Habr / Giktayms (unfortunately, the number of comments on Giktayms is very small, but the return of Megamind here again allows you to hope for normal communication). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ee8/3c1/5f3/ee83c15f31de4d36b8d77383c90a46a4.gif"><br><br>  So, I'm not a guru and not a coach.  However, in my over 35 years, I realized one simple thing - you should not read out bad books.  This stunning in its novelty conclusion follows from a simple mathematical calculation: <a name="habracut"></a>

      Suppose you are 30 years old (I am writing 30, because by this time usually there are already children, work, hobbies and so on).  If you are less - do not worry, everything changes quickly and has little effect on further calculations :) <br><br>  My own statistics, plus surveys of friends and acquaintances, plus all <a href="http://www.rba.ru/cms_rba/news/upload-files/news/2015/08_07/bookmarket_2014.pdf">-</a> Russian <a href="http://www.rba.ru/cms_rba/news/upload-files/news/2015/08_07/bookmarket_2014.pdf">statistics</a> show that on average we read no more than 10-12 books a year.  Now further, the average life expectancy in Russia is 71 years.  Thus, if you are 30, you need to read only 41 * 11 = 450 books.  Just think, only 450 books!  Considering that humankind has written much more books (the difference goes up by orders of magnitude), you should be very thoughtful about the choice of the current reading book.  If it still seems to you that 450 is a dofig, read to the end, I will give a few references to ratings that 50% of this amount will eat at a glance. <br><br>  Lyrical digression: a few years ago I read that the Chinese read an average of 6 books a year (I can‚Äôt find the link, but that was in the <a href="http://www.rusrep.ru/">Russian Reporter</a> ).  I was somewhat surprised by this number, since I myself had a few less.  By that time my first child was born, the workload increased dramatically, and so on and so forth.  Thoughtful analysis of myself showed that an attempt to read on a smartphone / tablet is doomed to failure - something constantly distracting, the same Habr, for example.  Therefore, I uncovered the old poketbook, after which the number of reads has doubled.  Then, consciously, I <a href="https://vybor-prost.ru/2016/07/01/best-e-ink-reader/">chose</a> the Kindle <a href="https://vybor-prost.ru/2016/07/01/best-e-ink-reader/">for</a> myself, having increased the amount of another 10 percent read, simply due to the convenience of automatically dropping books into the Kindle via Dropbox.  Last year, during the holidays, I managed to leave my reader on the bench and never saw him again.  The transition to the tablet again showed a decrease in the amount of read somewhere in half.  The appearance of the new Kindle has returned everything back to square one. <br><br>  But back to our 450 books (substitute your value here).  Framed?  And now we can safely divide the resulting value by 2. Why? <br><br>  In 2010, I came across a stunning idea: a certain Chinese Denis Oh <a href="http://www.trendhunter.com/trends/balancing-bookshelf">came up with a</a> bookshelf The Balance of Your Knowledge!  The idea is based on the principle of balance: the shelf is fastened centrally and can lean under the weight of books both to the right and to the left.  One of the parties relates to professional literature, the second - to the art.  And as soon as any "bowl" begins to outweigh, an urgent need to buy a counterweight. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/1a0/19d/b32/1a019db323ea417093aec744e4317b95.jpeg"><br><br>  I liked the idea so much that all these years I have been trying to alternate artistic and professional books in my virtual library.  The approach justifies itself, because art books are swallowed easily, and on professional ones, a stupor occurs periodically.  Thus, the desire to read something easy makes you deal with complex read material faster.  Well, it is possible to achieve any balance in development. <br><br>  In general, by the way, a strange thing.  The most useful books in life turned out to be non-artistic ‚Äî they have the strongest influence on everyday life and they lead to the most qualitative changes.  But fiction turned out to be the most productive in the sense that an understanding of cultural references brings the greatest pleasure from reading further.  Those.  the more you read and the more you have already read, the higher the pleasure in the future.  Funny thing number 2 - there is such an amazing series of Mikhail Uspensky about Zhikhar.  The pleasure of reading directly depends on the baggage of knowledge.  Reading 10 years ago and reading is now completely different.  This, I apologize for the comparison, how to re-read the Master and Margarita - Hippo was attached in childhood, and now I read Yeshua in monologues. <br><br>  Yes, by the way, rereading is included in the 450 books voiced above.  Because you stupidly did not understand part of the books at an earlier age. <br><br>  And now, as promised above, let's quickly fill in the reading list for the next few years :) <br><br>  <b>Art books.</b>  <b>Let's start with fiction:</b> <br>  At one time, I reposed a post on D3, a genius of its simplicity.  The author brought together all the nominees of the main science fiction literary contests (Hugo, Nebula and Locus), after which he received a list of books that, I quote, ‚Äúscored from 6 to 9 points (i.e. laureates of at least two awards, the‚Äú golden fund of fiction ‚Äù, so to tell)".  Not to say that I liked everything, but most of them are very, very cool.  Given that the post was written in 2011, for the last five years, what is readable can be calculated independently. <br>  <a href="https://dirty.ru/312365/">https://dirty.ru/312365/</a> <br>  <b>Total +14 books.</b> <br><br>  <b>Not only fiction</b> <br>  Some time ago, Billboard released a mega cool project of the <a href="http://mag.afisha.ru/stories/100-luchshih-romanov-veka/">100 best novels of the century</a> .  These are books written over the past 15 years, each of which is interesting and important in its own way.  At the moment I read a dozen books from this list, and they were all good. <br>  <b>Total +100 books</b> <br><br>  Plus, Galina Yuzefovich‚Äôs book reviews regularly <a href="https://meduza.io/specials/books">appear</a> on the jellyfish.  Something interesting is constantly coming up there. <br><br>  <b>General / Professional:</b> <br>  I will not write about highly specialized literature (each of us has its own).  But there are a number of books, the reading of which is simply necessary for general development.  The most interesting thing is that their list has already been compiled by Comrade <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/users/milfgard/" class="user_link">Milfgard</a> .  You can start with a relatively <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/mosigra/blog/254309/">fresh post</a> , and then move on the link to the past. <br><br>  PS: I understand perfectly well that everyone has their own way of finding interesting books.  My links are just one way to find something interesting.  The most important thing that I wanted to say - I beg you, do not waste time on nonsense.  His time is very, very little, and the nonsense is very, very much. <br><br>  PPS: With the new megahab division, I can‚Äôt choose a more suitable location.  It comes in GTD, as the closest.  I would be grateful if you correct. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/304664/">https://habr.com/ru/post/304664/</a></p>
