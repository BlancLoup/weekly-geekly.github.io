But there were also consumer devices, the cost of which was already lifting for average buyers.  Otherwise, there were sets for self-assembly. </p><br><p>  Game consoles, on the other hand, have already become more accessible means of entertainment than in the 1970s. </p><br><p>  Let's look at the prices of electronics of the 1980s - the time when the first commercial mobile phones, laptops and game consoles such as the Nintendo Entertainment System and the Sega Mega Drive appeared. </p><br><p>  <i>Start:</i> <br>  <a href="https://geektimes.ru/post/278880/">Prices for popular electronics of the past in today's money: 1970s</a> </p><br><h2>  Computers </h2><br><h3>  Sinclair ZX80 </h3><br><p>  In 1978, Sinclair released its first single board microcomputer, the Mk14, and sold twenty thousand copies.  Two years later, the company began to produce a personal computer ZX80.  It was the first computer in the UK, the price for which did not exceed ¬£ 100.  The price of the ZX80 was $ 199.95, which in 2016 is $ 595. </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/60f/828/5c8/60f8285c87f4d39492cce3e1d87a8935.jpg"><br></p><a name="habracut"></a><br><h3>  Commodore VIC-20 </h3><br><p>  The first microcomputer, to overcome the mark of a million copies sold, was the Commodore VIC-20.  Did it make sense to buy a video game, if for the same money you can buy a computer?  William Shetner from Star Trek participated in the ad.  Initially, the cost of VIC-20 was 299 dollars, but it was reduced to 55 dollars - that is, below cost. </p><br><p>  Translated into today's money, the price of a computer started from 892 dollars, and then dropped to 164 dollars. </p><br><iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/PUEI7mm8M7Q%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,1500003,15700021,15700186,15700190,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhgv2PXMfX2VIJIJmxuH84eCvFqqig" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/018/5e2/cdd/0185e2cdd3cdaa90978f144710cd56f3.jpg"><br></p><br><h3>  Ibm pc </h3><br><p>  If in 1975 you could buy an IBM 5100 portable personal computer for $ 20,000 - that is, $ 91,000 at prices of 2016, then in 1981 the first mainstream PC from the corporation, IBM PC, would cost only $ 3005 in top configuration.  This is about 8,130 dollars for 2016. </p><br><p>  The device worked on an Intel 8088, 4.77 MHz processor.  Software - IBM Basic. </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/bc0/068/45e/bc006845e115264bb4bae2ce23477089.jpg"><br></p><br><h3>  Texas Instruments TI-99 / 4A </h3><br><p>  In 1981, Texas Instruments released the TI-99 / 4A computer, capable of displaying 16 colors at a resolution of 512 √ó 424 or 256 colors at a resolution of 256 √ó 424.  The device worked on a TI TMS9900 3.0 MHz processor, had 256 bytes of RAM and 16 KB of video memory.  It was one of the first 16-bit home computers. </p><br><p>  The computer cost 525 dollars, which today is equal to 1420 dollars. </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/467/79b/47d/46779b47d4d180bbed4cfca9a21ec42d.jpg"><br></p><br><h3>  Sinclair ZX81 and Spectrum </h3><br><p>  From 1981 to 1983, Sinclair produced the ZX81 computer as a set for self-assembly or in assembled form.  The computer worked on the Zilog Z80 processor (3.25 MHz) or its equivalent from NEC - ŒºPD780C-1.  The screen displayed text in 24 lines of 32 characters.  ZX81 could simulate a graphics mode of 64 √ó 48 pixels. </p><br><p>  The assembled computer cost 69.99 pounds sterling, which <a href="http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/education/Pages/resources/inflationtools/calculator/flash/default.aspx">in 2015 was</a> 242 pounds (the Bank of England only provides a calculator until 2015). </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/7da/6de/b03/7da6deb0342b5c27e60de101de03e102.jpg"><br></p><br><p>  ZX Spectrum became the successor to the ZX80 in 1982.  It was a color home computer, which was affectionately nicknamed "Speccy."  The device became the best-selling English computer, and the founder of Sinclair Research Ltd Clive Sinclair became the "Knight of the Royal Order" with the rank of "Sir" for his contribution to the development of British industry. </p><br><p>  The cost of the computer was 175 pounds - today it is 557 pounds. </p><br><p>  Spectrum produced until 1992.  In the first 17 months alone, the company sold a million cars.  The main competitor to the ZX Spectrum in Europe was the Commodore 64. </p><br><iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/mh0g73JvFbo%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,1500003,15700021,15700186,15700190,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhicHRCSshjsVZxKSz-QNPmxUGIa0Q" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/5f0/419/1e7/5f04191e72770d18c92fab449353f735.jpg" width="600"><br></p><br><h3>  Commodore 64 </h3><br><p>  Personal computer Commodore 64 produced from 1982 to 1994.

A special VIC II processor allowed displaying 16 shades on a screen of 320x200 pixels in the two-color mode or 160x200 in the four-color mode.  For text mode, vertical and horizontal smooth screen scrolling was supported.  A special SID processor was responsible for the sound: the computer had 3 voices for 8 octaves each and filters, which made it possible to use it as a full-fledged synthesizer. </p><br><p>  The price of a computer started at $ 595, which is $ 1,518 for 2016.  A total of 15 million copies were sold. </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/3f9/f34/7c9/3f9f347c991a66e9eb111c1497d15387.jpg" width="600"><br></p><br><h3>  Apple Lisa and Macintosh </h3><br><p>  Computer Apple Lisa Steve Jobs named after his daughter.
