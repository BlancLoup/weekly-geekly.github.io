      ‚ÄúWe are deeply saddened by the fact that our beloved father passed away today.  He was a great scientist and an extraordinary man whose work and legacy will live for many years, ‚Äùthe family said in a statement.  ‚ÄúHis courage and perseverance with his brilliance and humor inspired people all over the world.  He once said: ‚ÄúIt would not be a big part of the Universe if it were not home to people you love.‚Äù  We will always miss him. ‚Äù <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/6b/_v/wy/6b_vwy67-isepk2rwdboe_qcxu8.jpeg"><br><br>  In 1963, Stephen Hawking was diagnosed with a disease of the motor neurons (amyotrophic lateral sclerosis), as a result of which he was almost completely paralyzed.  Then the doctors said that he had two years to live.  Or two and a half.  He left behind a daughter Lucy and two sons, Robert and Tim.  They thanked his fans, who ‚Äúwere on the side of Professor Hawking‚Äù and supported him throughout their lives. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Hawking was considered one of the leading voices in science because of his extensive research and work related to understanding the universe. <br><br>  ‚ÄúI never expected to live to 75, so I was very lucky to be able to think about my heritage,‚Äù Hawking told the BBC last year in an interview. <br><br>  He made several major discoveries throughout his career, and once said that his greatest achievement was the discovery that black holes are not exactly black. <br><br>  ‚ÄúI think my biggest achievement will be my discovery, that black holes are not exactly black,‚Äù he said, adding that this discovery would be crucial for ‚Äúunderstanding how to solve the paradoxes between quantum mechanics and general relativity .  Of these, there is a way out and, possibly, to another Universe.  If you feel that you have fallen into a black hole, do not give up - there is a way out. ‚Äù <br><br>  In an interview with 2010 at World New Tonight, ABC Hawking was asked about his father‚Äôs best advice. <br><br>  ‚ÄúHere are the most important tips that I gave to my children,‚Äù he said.  ‚ÄúDo not forget to look at the stars, and not under your feet.  Never give up work.  Work will give you meaning and purpose, without it, life is empty.  If you are lucky to find love, remember that this is rare and do not lose it. ‚Äù <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/e_/jm/yv/e_jmyv8ybdimr9a76edj8k9ikqi.jpeg"><br><br>  Here is the schedule for the life of Stephen Hawking compiled by the Associated Press: <br><br>  January 8, 1942 - was born in Oxford, England, the eldest of four children born to Frank Hawking, a biologist, and Isabel Hawking, secretary of medical research. <br><br>  1952 - enters the school of St. Alban. <br><br>  1959 - receives a scholarship to study at University College, Oxford, in which he studies the direction of "Natural Sciences". <br><br>  1962 - begins research in cosmology at the University of Cambridge. <br><br>  1963 - at the age of 21, Stephen is diagnosed with a degenerative nerve disorder ALS or Lou Gehrig's disease.  Then the doctors said that he had two years to live. <br><br>  July 14, 1965 - Marries his first wife, Jane Wilde, a student of modern languages, whom he met at Cambridge. <br><br>  1967 - the first son of the couple, Robert, swarmed. <br><br>  1970 - Jane gives birth to a daughter, Lucy. <br><br>  1974 - at the age of 32 he was elected a member of the Royal Society, becoming one of the youngest people who received this honor. <br><br>  1979 - becomes a professor of mathematics at Cambridge, taking up the prestigious post that was once held by Isaac Newton.  Hawking holds the post until 2009.  Jane gives birth to a third child, Timothy. <br><br>  1985 - During his visit to the European Organization for Nuclear Research CERN in Geneva (Switzerland), Stephen Hawking fell ill with pneumonia.  At the hospital, he was hooked up to a forced ventilation device and thus supported the life of a scientist.  But later, in connection with the severity of the disease, doctors suggested that the physicist's wife disconnect him from life-support apparatuses.  After a firm refusal, Stephen Hawking's wife was transported to Cambridge.  Here, in a local hospital, he was operated on, as a result of which he was able to breathe again on his own, but lost his ability to speak forever.  The following year, he begins to communicate using an electronic voice synthesizer, receiving his famous "robotic voice", with which he is identified.  That is why he used this ancient hardware speech synthesizer until the end of his days. <br><br>  1988 - publishes A Brief History of Time, a book about cosmology intended for the general public, which becomes an instant bestseller. <br><br>  1989 - Queen Elizabeth II rewards him with an honorary title. <br><br>  1995 - Marries his Nurse, Elaine Mason. <br><br>  2007 - divorces Elaine Mason. <br><br>  2014 - The autobiographical film about the life of Stephen Hawking ‚ÄúThe Theory of Everything‚Äù, based on the memoir ‚ÄúJourney to Infinity: My Life with Stephen‚Äù by Jane Hawking. <br><br>  Today, on this day, I would like to recall how Stephen Hawking was and what he taught us.  Below I want to present you a translation of a 2013 documentary.  The film tells about the life of this amazing person from school years to the present day, and also allows you to look at life through his eyes. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YESJaDpsjG4" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  Personally, Stephen taught me not to give up and move on: <br><br>  ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs hard for me to say something good about motor neuron disease.  But this disease has taught me not to feel sorry for myself, because things have been worse for others.  I continue to do what I am still able to do.  No matter how difficult life is, there is always something you can do and succeed in it.  I'm not afraid of death, but I'm not in a hurry to die.  First I have to do many more things.  And I noticed that even people who claim that everything is predetermined and that we can not change anything, look around before they cross the road. ‚Äù <br><br>  "When your expectations are reduced to zero, then you begin to truly appreciate what you have." </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/371343/">https://habr.com/ru/post/371343/</a></p>
