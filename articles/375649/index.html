And what was impossible then is now becoming the norm. <a name="habracut"></a>  Just three weeks ago, Samsung announced their ‚Äúcurved‚Äù candy bar, this week the guys from LG did the same.  And this is just the beginning.  Unfortunately, this cool news is only for PC users and if <a href="http://www.adweek.com/adfreak/apples-get-mac-complete-campaign-130552">you have a Mac</a> like mine, then it <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2014/6/26/5845138/choose-your-religion-iphone-or-android">remains to depend on the whims</a> of Apple designers and engineers.

      Just came back from CES and you know what?  Curved TVs are there at every turn.  I remember last year they were also, but in much smaller quantities.  And now all manufacturers, whether Samsung, LG, Sony or Hisense, all sell their ‚Äúcrooked‚Äù TVs.  Only one Vizio sits on the sidelines, not wanting to "bend or bend" and <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2014/12/23/7444009/vizio-mocks-curved-tv-trend-with-new-infomercial">quietly makes fun of competitors</a> .  And if the ‚Äúdirect‚Äù TV in the apartment is the answer for everyone except single singles, then with curved monitors and All-in-One PC is not so simple. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ae7/ec6/456/ae7ec64569124acaa600c141041717df.jpg"><br><br>  TV makers want to make you believe that crookedness is the cure for all ills.  That you get a more exciting experience watching movies, improved depth, moreover, different distortions and reflections will decrease, hair will not fall out, and sex life will become more diverse.  But wait!  Were not these schemers a few years ago trying to plant the whole world <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/1/8/3852452/death-of-3d">on a 3D needle</a> and catch a new wave of sales.  Maybe there is some benefit from a curved TV for people who live alone and sit <a href="http://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2014/01/whats-the-deal-with-curved-tvs/">just a few steps away</a> from a 50-inch LCD panel.  And what about those who have a family?  In this case, I am ready to sit alone, often for several hours, a couple of feet from the center of my iMac.  This makes me a target audience for vendors and manufacturers of curved All-in-One PCs and monitors. <br><br>  Last week I managed to try the new <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2014/12/30/7469309/samsung-ativ-one-7-curved-all-in-one-pc-announced-price-release-date">Samsung Ativ One 7</a> monoblock.  It's something plastic and ugly, partly due to running on 27-inches, with a resolution of 1920 x 1080, Windows.  And although the experience of use was not the best, I clearly saw the advantages of working with a ‚Äúcurved‚Äù screen.  Looking closely at the <a href="http://www.samsung.com/uk/news/local/samsung-electronics-introduces-se790c-curved-monitor-for-the-ultimate-immersive-viewing-experience%3FCID%3DAFL-hq-mul-0813-11000170">34-inch</a> Samsung curved monitor with an aspect ratio of 21: 9 and a resolution of 3440 x 1440, I was completely imbued with the idea.  This is a more interesting way of perceiving information, reflections, indeed, less.  Yes, it just looks pretty damn cool. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f33/3c1/460/f333c1460ce54b328c574f85495fe122.jpg"><br><br>  You know what?  LG also has such <a href="http://www.lg.com/us/monitors/lg-34UC97-S-ultrawide-monitor">curved 21: 9 displays</a> and they are also suppliers of <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/Teardown/iMac%2BIntel%2B27-Inch%2BRetina%2B5K%2BDisplay%2BTeardown/30260">5K panels</a> for the new iMac.  And although the panels from Samsung and LG fade in comparison to the 5K iMac display with a resolution of 5120 x 2880, they are better compared to the old 27-inch iMac display, which has 2560 pixels horizontally and 1440 vertically. <br><br>  Let's get clean, I don‚Äôt have any insider information about Apple‚Äôs plans.  All that I know is that they have not changed the design of their candy bars since the iMac G5, launched in 2006 (and the transition to aluminum in 2009). <br><br>  What I really want is that I have a 34-inch iMac that surrounds me from the sides.  Hell, until my wishes are fulfilled, let's make a continuous curve of three monitors.  At this size (and my age), I want pixels to surround me wherever I can see them. <br><br>  And from here, from this futuristic command center, in which I am able to do such things of the future as, like ... hell, yes, the same things as now, but at least you will feel in a stream of progress. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/375649/">https://habr.com/ru/post/375649/</a></p>
