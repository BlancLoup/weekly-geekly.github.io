  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Piezo Electric Power Generator</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The rush in the world in relation to the creation of piezoelectric energy sources, until recently, was not distinguished by a high level of inventive proposals.  For example, Israeli scientists propose to mount the piezoelectric elements in the roadway and use the energy of passing cars.  In Japan, the floor of one of the subway halls is covered with piezo elements.  These and similar projects of voltage generators do not withstand any criticism from an economic point of view.  The reason is as follows. <br><br>  In one click of an electric lighter, which lasts about 0.1 nanoseconds, more than 2 megawatts of power are released.  That is, the power per second is 0.2 watt.  If you could make 1000 clicks per second, you would get 200 watts of power.  Power is big, but how to make 1000 clicks per second.  It is impossible, but you can press the piezoelectric element to a smooth rotating wheel 20 thousand times or more, exciting ultrasonic vibrations in it. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  This at least proves the figure below (Fig. 1).  The thirty watts of power taken from the piezoelectric element (watts per gram of piezoelectric element) in continuous mode at a voltage of 300V was enough to power the fluorescent lamp.  For this, the energy of the rotating wheel is converted into bending ultrasonic vibrations of a tuning fork made at one of the ends of the Langevin package, and then, due to the piezoelectric effect, into high-frequency electrical oscillations. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/c8b/d9d/d3a/c8bd9dd3a4ad9b87ca283077b2bfcbad.png" alt="rice one">

      That is, using piezoelectric elements, it is possible to create not only electric voltage generators, but also power generators. <br><br>  The idea of ‚Äã‚Äãusing a piezoelectric motor as a power generator (Fig. 2) did not get enough attention for a long time.  The reason is that, according to this idea, one type of oscillation must be forced in one of the parts of the piezoelectric element.  This part is called the causative agent.  For this, in addition to mechanical stress, a separate power source is used.  The second type of oscillation must be generated in another part of the piezoelectric element, due to the forced rotation of the rotor.  This part of the piezoelectric element is called the generator. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/431/eb5/8f3/431eb58f314ec21b5f402fd978512b2e.png" alt="rice 2"><br><br>  Tests of prototypes confirmed the possibility of obtaining energy in the generator.  But the generator power must be several times greater than the power taken from the pathogen power source.  Otherwise, this generator does not make sense.  That's just how long it did not work. <br><br>  Only relatively recently, Vyacheslav Lavrinenko, the inventor of the piezoelectric motor, retired, working at home after a careful selection of materials of the piezoelectric element and contact pairs was able to get useful power at the load several times more than the power taken from an additional power source.  It was possible to send part of the generator power to the pathogen and remove an additional source.  He solved this problem in two ways. <br><br>  According to the first method, I measured the amplitude and phase at the input of the pathogen and, with the help of the reactive elements, we adjusted the voltage at the generator output to the same amplitude and phase.  That is, as in conventional electric generators, the conditions of amplitude and phase balance were satisfied.  When these conditions were met, the output was closed to the input. <br><br>  In the second method, the voltage from the generator was transformed into a constant voltage, which was used to power the power amplifier and the low-power alternating voltage generator.  As it was possible to steadily obtain useful power within 0.2 watts per gram of piezoelectric element, Lavrinenko discovers an interesting effect, comparable in physics with the discovery, which he formulated as follows: <br><br><blockquote>  In two mutually perpendicular acoustic oscillations, combined in one body, resonant frequencies shifted relative to each other to create a phase shift between oscillations, when they are excited, spontaneously transverse oscillations are generated at the frequency between said resonant frequencies during frictional interaction of the body with another body, for example , with a rotating wheel. </blockquote><br>  That is, with the frictional interaction of the bodies mentioned, there is a positive feedback.  The appearance of random vibrations form an ellipse, the dimensions of which increase with the rotation of the wheel.  Similarly, electrical oscillations are spontaneously excited in an electrical voltage amplifier, covered by positive feedback, and the energy of the dc source is converted to an ac voltage.  The dependence of this voltage on the speed of rotation has the form shown in Fig.3. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/ea4/0ba/d28/ea40bad284c4345f933b3175a347112a.png" alt="rice 3"><br><br>  The discovered effect considerably simplifies the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãcreating piezoelectric power generators, and the power of 5 watts per gram of piezoelectric element becomes quite real.  Whether they will have advantages over electromagnetic generators can only be said with time, as they are studied, although some of them can be said now. <br><br>  The absence of copper and windings is reliability in conditions of high humidity.  The absence of heavy metals (copper and iron alloys) is high specific parameters.  The high-frequency signal received at the exit, is easily transformed under any loading.  And the main advantage is that a gearbox is not required for any wheel speeds.  It is enough to correctly calculate the diameter of the wheel. <br><br>  If it is impossible to use solar batteries, piezoelectric power generators using energy, muscle or wind can replace them, for example, to charge notebook batteries, tablets, etc. Although the relevance of the direction is obvious, its development requires sufficient financial support, which, like many projects of our countries, not yet. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/367975/">https://habr.com/ru/post/367975/</a></p>
