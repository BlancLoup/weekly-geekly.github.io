  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Adizes PAEI Management Styles and Scrum Roles</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  According to experts, the success of the project largely depends on the personal qualities of the leaders and the ‚Äústaffing‚Äù of the management of these qualities.  Unfortunately, these qualities are not always taken into account in the formation of management.  This creates risks and often leads to failure.  This article discusses the typology of Adizes managers and the correspondence of these types to different roles in Scrum. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  Adizes classification </h2><br>  A global management expert, Yitzhak Adizes, proposed a typology of managers based on four functions: <br><br><ul><li>  <b>Producing results (P)</b> - production of results, in fact, for the sake of which the organization exists (short-term perspective); <br><br></li><li>  <b>Administering (A)</b> - administration required for efficiency (short term);

      <br>
    </li><li>  <b>Entrepreneuring (E)</b> is an enterprise for change management (long-term perspective); <br><br></li><li>  <b>Integrating (I)</b> - the integration necessary to ensure the viability of the organization in the long term by combining its elements (long term). </li></ul><br>  According to the expert, there are no managers who have all these functions at the same time have been very strongly developed (PAEI).  Usually, successful managers have well developed functions and some of them are excellent (PaEi, Paei, paEi, etc.).  At the same time, for the successful existence of an organization, it is necessary that, in the aggregate, in management, all these functions should be presented at an excellent level.  Moreover, it is necessary that the characteristics of each manager correspond to his activities.  So, the head of the production department needs to be at least Paei, and the HR manager for corporate culture and atmosphere should be paeI. <br><br>  It happens that the manager completely lacks 3 (P ---, ‚ÄìA‚Äì, ‚ÄìE‚Äì, --- I) or all 4 (----) functions.  According to Adizes, this is very dangerous for the project and the enterprise.  So, --- I usually means intrigue and decomposition of a collective, instead of integration in the case of paeI.  Of course, such a team cannot work normally, a routine is formed, and usually from the most qualified personnel.  On the other hand, P --- is a manager who does all the work himself, without trusting her team members.  This leads to blockages and downtime in the short term and creates great risks for the future project. <br><br><h2>  Adizes classification and roles in Scrum </h2><br>  Scrum does not mean a manager in the classic sense.  His roles are blurred between Product Owner (PO), Scrum Master (SM) and the team (DT from the Development Team).  However, this does not mean that there is no management and should not be taken into account by PAEI in the assignment to the role.  Therefore, we will try to expand on these functions. <br><br>  The PO must set goals, work out the concept, vision, form requirements, deal with issues of budget and profitability.  He needs to collect information from all stakeholders, process it, determine the feasibility and profitability, find the most profitable solution.  Therefore, he needs to have an entrepreneurial perspective, i.e.  be E. For example, paEi. <br><br>  But he also needs to understand how everything is produced, what is the specificity inside, as well as to be focused on the short term - what will happen at the end of the sprint and what will please the stakeholders.  Therefore, all the same, in the opinion of the author, it is best if PO is PaEi. <br><br>  The task of SM is to ensure that Scrum processes are respected.  Even their evolution must go in accordance with these processes.  He also needs to provide the team with everything necessary, to solve or escalate the problems that arise.  Therefore, he needs to be A. Moreover, he must maintain an atmosphere in the team, promote mutual understanding between team members, as well as with people external to the team, and promote the growth of team spirit and cohesion.  This is all I. Thus, pAeI. <br><br>  Usually a team is focused on a short-term sprint length or 2-3.  Their goal is to produce everything they promised for the sprint.  Those.  Paei.  This is basically the minimum requirement for a team.  However, if they do not think about architecture, refactor, implement any best practices, then at some point the system will simply become impossible to support and expand.  Therefore, the team needs a long-term vision, analysis and implementation of best practices, etc., which corresponds to E. <br><br>  Also, the team is engaged in planning and control, compliance with any accepted norms, processes and practices (code style, coverage with code review, etc.), which is an administrative function - A. Thus, it would be good for the team to be PAEi.  Fortunately, it is a team and there may be people in it that promote productivity, long-term vision and administration. <br><br>  I would like to draw attention to the fact that Adizes recommends that in the management of a team / enterprise there should be two people with PaEi and pAeI and better if PaEi is ‚Äúhigher‚Äù pAeI.  This just corresponds to the functions of the Product Owner and Scrum Master, only in Scrum PO is not the head of the SM and the team, but only performs its functions. <br><br><h2>  Example </h2><br>  The author is familiar with the case when the Product Owner was --- I, and the Scrum Master - PaEi.  Those.  they had strongly / poorly developed these functions as individuals, although the roles required a different set.  This led to intrigues from the POs, conflicts, a decline in performance and the dismissal of team members. <br><br>  Not wanting to work in such an environment and in the conditions of personnel shortages in the market, they quickly found new jobs.  The project at that time had dubious prospects, due to the lack of a complete set of PAEI in management: there was no one to ‚Äúproduce‚Äù, ‚Äúadminister‚Äù and think about the future. <br><br><h2>  Conclusion </h2><br>  Understanding the fact that there are not so many qualified personnel on the market, one should still take into account management styles when forming teams.  This has a significant impact on the success and achievement of goals. <br><br><h2>  Literature </h2><br><ol><li>  Perfect leader.  Why they cannot become and what follows from this, Adizes Yitzchak Calderon, 2013. </li><li>  Scrum Guide, Ken Schwaber and Jeff Sutherland, 2013. </li><li>  Scrum Body of Knowledge, Scrum Institute, 2016. </li></ol></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/317344/">https://habr.com/ru/post/317344/</a></p>
