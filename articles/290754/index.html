      <b>One word that best describes how you work:</b> <br>  Enthusiastically <br><br>  <b>How many hours a day do you work?</b> <br>  In the office I am about 11-12 hours.  Naturally, not all this time is directly ‚Äúsitting‚Äù. <br>  Lunch is half an hour, a break for a walk over coffee - in the summer at the office it is very cozy to walk among the flowers, walk to the beach, look at the water.  Inhale-exhale, inhale-exhale - you come back with new forces and a constructive approach to any situation.  I do English twice a week in the office, if there is no hard work, I go to the gym once or twice a week.  Pure working hours on average 9.5-10. <br><br>  <b>Current mobile device:</b> <br>  The main one is HTC One; <br>  iPhone 6 - as a player and spare phone for tests; <br>  On the go - iPad Mini. <br><br>  <b>Current computer:</b> <br>  Dell Latittude E7240 <br><br>  <b>Without any applications, programs, utilities you can not live?</b> <br>  I can‚Äôt live exactly without water, but of course there is a link to the smartphone and the Internet. <br>  Not convenient without instant messengers.  I use three.  Evenly distributed contacts on WhatsApp, Viber, Telegram. <br>  For work I will survive the absence of everything except Excel. <br><br>  <b>Which life hack helps you save time?</b> <br>  I am not an example of the optimal allocation of time, but I try to fix it. <br>  I delete everything superfluous from life (everything that is not useful and not happy): communication, sticking habits in Facebook, alcohol, which even in modest doses for a long time knocks the brain out of working condition. <br><br>  It took several years to develop the skill of delegation.  Mania total control passes when finding his people in the team.  Everybody is mistaken when re-checking, too.  Lack of total control releases time perceptibly. <br><br>  Combining processes.  All that can be paralleled from cases without prejudice to the result - I combine. <br><br>  <b>What kind of to-do manager do you use?</b> <br>  The team caught Asana.  I write important tasks in a notebook - I adore the moment of deleting closed questions.  They advise tasks in Outlook due to easy synchronization with mail, but it‚Äôs not working out for me yet. <br><br>  <b>What do you listen when you work?</b> <br>  Headphones use to create silence when you need to focus on numbers.  And I listen to music as a rest - I listen to the melody, I love to sing along.  And from work she distracts me. <br><br>  <b>What are you reading now?</b> <br>  Before I leave, I refresh the yachting theory in my memory: Ivanichkin ‚ÄúYachting School‚Äù and Vatrunin ‚ÄúYacht Captain‚Äù. <br><br>  <b>Which book from the last read was remembered the most?</b> <br>  Asya Kazantseva: ‚ÄúWho would have thought!  How the brain makes us do stupid things. ‚Äù  Recommend! <br><br>  <b>Do you use e-readers or prefer paper books?</b> <br>  At home, a large family library, so when buying paper copies - hard casting.  Electronic do not disdain.  I read from a three-year Pocketbook Touch.  From reading from the phone and ipad faster tired eyes. <br><br>  <b>How long do you sleep?</b> <br>  I try to sleep for 8 hours, when less - I recall the morning Wall-e with a discharged battery.  In fact, it turns out 7. I do not use sleep trackers (probably in vain). <br><br>  <b>Are you an owl or a lark?</b> <br>  Owl, unfortunately.  I am trying to retrain in order to start working earlier, and in the evening there was time for my personal life.  But the brain refuses to work normally until 11, and the peak of mental activity - in the afternoon and at the very evening. <br><br>  <b>How do you have breakfast?</b> <br>  I seldom have breakfast - I prefer to sleep an extra 10 minutes.  On weekdays in the morning I drink water to disperse.  I don‚Äôt feel like the first two hours, and after two I‚Äôm on the road.  On the way, I gnaw some fruit or have breakfast in the office with my colleagues. <br><br>  <b>How do you spend your time on the way to work / from work?</b> <br>  In the subway - I read, watch TV shows and train English.  I travel by car at the peak time.  On the road, I speak by phone or listen to lectures on Youtube or Coursera.  Often I sing - it sets up a positive day or helps to disconnect in the evening. <br><br>  <b>What advice you have ever been given can you convey to others?</b> <br>  All important advice was given to me, a reactive person, on the topic of controlling emotions.  It is incorrect to single out individual people / books - the influence is complex in the spirit of ‚Äúparents say something at 20, and only comes to 40‚Äù.  The most important thing - keep quiet and wait.  Do not rush to give a reaction to the words and actions of people.  Sometimes the situation or your attitude to it changes in a minute.  And you can catch firewood in the first seconds.  Similarly, about making decisions at night.  I postpone for the morning - you look at the situation more easily and more soberly. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/290754/">https://habr.com/ru/post/290754/</a></p>
