I will not name the hoster, - this is a separate story.  The configuration of the new server was as follows. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h3>  Iron </h3><br><ul><li>  AMD Opteron (tm) Processor 6386 SE </li><li>  2800 MHz </li><li>  RAM 1024 MB </li></ul><br><h3>  System </h3><br><ul><li>  Ubuntu Server 14.04 </li><li>  PHP 5.5.9 </li><li>  MySQL 5.5 </li><li>  Nginx 1.8 (port 8080) </li><li>  Memcached </li><li>  Varnish (port 80) </li></ul><br>  Of the additional third-party plug-ins were also installed W3 Total Cache and WordPress SEO by Yoast, which, surprisingly, not so much load the server.  But first things first.

      So, the first and probably the most important reason why I decided to shovel the Jetpack is the <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/websitepulse/blog/133711/">TTFB</a> (Time To First Byte) indicator, which increased by as much as 80-110 ms., That is, if the server‚Äôs response was earlier after cleaning the cache and rebooting the system in the region of 190-220 ms., then after installing the Jetpack, this figure increased to 320 ms.  I emphasize - precisely after installing Jetpack.  I mean, if you even turn off all the components of the plugin, it‚Äôs still connected to the WordPress core and you won‚Äôt be able to get rid of the inhibition.  I immediately began to look for a replacement for all individual components, and this is what happened. <br><br><ol><li>  Components such as <strong>Custom CSS</strong> , <strong>Extra Sidebar Widgets</strong> , <strong>Infinite Scroll</strong> , <strong>Site Icon, Mobile Theme, Site Verification Tools</strong> , <strong>Sharing</strong> I think you can screw it yourself, if your hands obey the brain and grow from the right place.  And if you have not heard of such a wonderful service as <a href="http://generatewp.com/">GenerateWP</a> , then I advise you to look there. </li><li>  <strong>Shortcode Embeds is a</strong> necessary thing, but for all the time I use the Jetpack plugin, I have never come in handy, especially since WordPress has so many default shortcodes inserted <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/%25D0%2592%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B2%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B0_%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B1%25D1%258A%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BA%25D1%2582%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2">available</a> . </li><li>  <strong>Jetpack Comments</strong> most likely attracts many, but at least once you have been counting the number of .js scripts that are pulling from you.  That is, you can also not count on a good indicator in Google Pagespeed.  I chose Disqus comments for myself as one of the most successful solutions, and <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/disqus-conditional-load/">Disqus Conditional Load</a> served as a plugin for integration into WordPress. </li><li>  Let's be honest - at least once you've used such components as <strong>Beautiful Math</strong> , <strong>Enhanced Distribution</strong> , <strong>Markdown</strong> , <strong>Post By Email</strong> , <strong>Spelling and Grammar</strong> .  I personally enjoyed it, but I did not see the real benefit.  As for posting via e-mail, this option has long been present in WordPress, but not everyone will be able to deal with it the first time, since the launch of Cron is required. </li></ol><br><br>  In more detail, I would like to touch on the components of <strong>Photon</strong> , <strong>Publicize</strong> and <strong>Protect</strong> , which seemed to me in principle very useful tools.  But there are three "but". <br><br>  The first involves <strong>Photon</strong> , which downloads images from the CDN (content delivery network) WordPress.com.  This means that links to your images are transformed from <code><a href=""></a> site.ru/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/image.jpg</code>  <code><a href=""></a> site.ru/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/image.jpg</code> into something similar <code><a href=""></a> i2.wp.com/site.ru/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/image.jpg</code>  <code><a href=""></a> i2.wp.com/site.ru/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/image.jpg</code> , that is, the search engine does not index your domain. <br><br>  The second "but" affected <strong>Publicize</strong> .  The automatic sharing of posts in social networks today is a very important and significant tool in promoting a resource, but here‚Äôs the lack of sharing in the <strong>Publicize</strong> component on VKontakte hooked me a little.  I don‚Äôt want to raise a certain holivar and give many reasons why foreign services often simply ignore support in their API for Russian social projects, but on the other hand it‚Äôs disrespect to a huge audience of the same VKontakte.  A replacement was found in the <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/social-networks-auto-poster-facebook-twitter-g/">Social Networks Auto-Poster</a> plugin. <br><br>  The most recent and in my opinion perhaps one of the most successful solutions for protecting the admin panel of your WordPress site is the new <strong>Protect</strong> component.  And how I want such a wonderful tool to go separately from the Jetpack plugin.  After all, it is almost impossible to find fault with the <strong>Protect</strong> component; it does its job at the WordPress.com network level, thereby protecting it well against brute force.  In this regard, I fully agree with <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/users/kovshenin/" class="user_link">kovshenin</a> , who also considers <strong>Protect to be a</strong> good tool.  For a long time I was still inclined to opt for two-factor authentication, which gave rise to the third "but." <br><br>  In general, a plugin like Jetpack in the WordPress world is one of the leaders, and for many it is an indispensable tool.  But as for me, the jetpack is not as ‚Äúreactive‚Äù as it seems. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/259117/">https://habr.com/ru/post/259117/</a></p>
