Dzerzhinsky, 161 drink coffee before the start and until three o'clock in the afternoon listen to lectures on the development.  We will talk about Vue.js and CQRS, try to find common ground between SQL and NoSQL, talk about the limits of code perfection and true Quality Assurance, dispel fears of an interview with the customer and answer design questions.  In addition, we invited Mikhail Skipsky, a player of the ‚ÄúWhat?  Where?  When? ‚Äù, Owner of two‚Äú Crystal Owls ‚Äù(2010, 2016) - he will talk about decision making and effectiveness in small groups. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  As always, in addition to the lectures, we prepared activities for the participants, and all presentations and videos of the speakers' speeches will be available on the event website.

      And at 17 o'clock in the Stage club in the SEC ‚ÄúMarmalade‚Äù there will be an after party - Mikhail will hold an intellectual battle for the conference participants.  Let's test in practice the theses from his speech! <br><br>  More about the reports: <br><br><img align="left" src="https://habrastorage.org/web/922/dd2/ef7/922dd2ef7d8b483cab02d7a6559b2284.jpg">  <b>How to pass an interview with the customer</b> <br>  <i>Andrei Kholyavkin, Head of the Arcadia Taganrog Office</i> <br><br>  Any developer or tester of a service IT company will sooner or later come to this mysterious event - in order to get to a new, such an interesting and attractive project, you need to pass an interview with customer representatives.  For the first time it may even scare! <br><br>  The report gathered and summarized the best practices in preparing for the successful completion of such interviews and interesting case studies from experience.  It will be interesting to both developers and their project managers. <br><br><img align="left" src="https://habrastorage.org/web/50b/e84/d5c/50be84d5cbc84a538b24c1dae2bfe02b.jpg">  <b>Vue.js: new front end framework</b> <br>  <i>Mikhail Zotov, developer</i> <br><br>  Among the many frameworks for the front end, Angular and React are the most popular and well-known, but the new Vue.js framework is a good competitor.  Mikhail will consider the advantages of Vue.js over his competitors and describe in detail the internal structure of the components of Vue.js. <br><br><img align="left" src="https://habrastorage.org/web/bae/43e/19c/bae43e19c6fe41a385d7ae90a66d080f.jpg">  <b>From erectus tester to QA sapiens</b> <br>  <i>Nikita Belkovsky, QA Engineer</i> <br><br>  Nikita was engaged in testing on projects of different complexity, with different teams and different approaches to management.  But one project was significantly different from all the others.  This story is about how on a ‚Äúweak‚Äù project he managed to feel what Quality Assurance is. <br><br><img align="left" src="https://habrastorage.org/web/408/2cb/01c/4082cb01ce75429c9911cecd2b3b8cc5.jpg">  <b>CQRS principle in event web architecture</b> <br>  <i>Mikhail Chernorutsky, IT-specialist</i> <br><br>  The report is devoted to the consideration of one of the patterns of building the web backend architecture - CQRS (Command Query Request Segregation).  Let us discuss what CQRS is and in what cases it makes sense to use it: <br><br><ul><li>  the origin and purpose of the CQRS pattern (Command Query Responsibility Segregation); </li><li>  Advantages and disadvantages; </li><li>  the use of the CQRS pattern in web system architectures; </li><li>  related concepts: Event Sourcing, Eventual Consistency, Materialized Views, etc. </li></ul><br><br><img align="left" src="https://habrastorage.org/web/a5f/0cf/510/a5f0cf510d1f406893e4b1e13b9df8f3.jpg">  <b>Design Questions</b> <br>  <i>Boris Vinokurov, UX-UI Designer</i> <br><br>  Who are UX / UI designers?  Why are they needed in the process of designing web applications?  Is it possible to do without their help and is this help?  How do they differ from other designers and can they be considered artists?  How is their work process?  What is considered a good result and why?  Creative and creative or problem solving?  Or maybe you have your own questions?  I will be glad to answer. <br><br><img align="left" src="https://habrastorage.org/web/646/82b/4dc/64682b4dc0b14e828768f9ec66acc0a7.jpg">  <b>Clean code in commercial development.</b>  <b>Is there a limit to perfection?</b> <br>  <i>Yuri Kovalev, developer</i> <br><br>  This report offers a look at the problem of eradicating dirty code when developing and supporting large commercial projects.  Consider the famous scout rule with specific examples from life.  Let's try to determine which refactoring rules will repeatedly pay off in the future, and which ones are not so important as to slow down the development process because of them.  And finally, let's see how to clean a very dirty and complex code with minimal effort, without disrupting the development time. <br><br><img align="left" src="https://habrastorage.org/web/b57/3f6/120/b573f61203484653bb5d945f69e2d73b.jpg"><img align="left" src="https://habrastorage.org/web/fcf/bc4/118/fcfbc41181ed4982a00283f25267105c.jpg">  <b>SQL or NoSQL?</b> <br>  <i>Vladimir Kalskov, Senior Developer</i> <br>  <i>Oleg Bragin, Senior Developer</i> <br><br>  Two different - at first glance - approach to organizing data storage.  Two different universes in which people live and work with different types of thinking.  Can they come together?  Will any of the approaches dominate in the future?  Try to find the perfect way to store data. <br><br><img align="left" src="https://habrastorage.org/web/b1f/b74/342/b1fb743426c94ec89add94a99a761821.jpg">  <b>What?</b>  <b>Where?</b>  <b>When?</b>  <b>as a team work model</b> <br>  <i>Mikhail Skipsky</i> <br><br>  We usually perceive TV games as entertaining content, thinking little about the fact that any game is initially a model.  In the case of ‚ÄúWhat?  Where?  When? ‚Äù- social and technological decision-making model.  This means that by understanding how to play "CPG" and similar games, we will understand how the group decides, how it is managed and what problems prevent a small team from being effective. <br><br>  To participate you must register on <a href="http://azov.developersmeetup.ru/">the conference website</a> .  Come, it will be interesting! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/337908/">https://habr.com/ru/post/337908/</a></p>
