    <a name="habracut"></a>  <b>About the conference</b> <br><br>  The POC conference is the largest regional information security event, gathering more than 300 specialists from Korea, China, Japan and other nearby countries.  This year the event is held for the seventh time. <br><br>  Conference site: <a href="http://www.powerofcommunity.net/">http://www.powerofcommunity.net</a> <br>  Hashtag on Twitter: <a href="https://twitter.com/search%3Fq%3D%2523POC2012%26src%3Dhash"># POC2012</a> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/9cd/de4/098/9cdde40982fcb863d6788ccdf9e1f0d2.jpg"><br><h6>  Me and Power of Community </h6><br>  There are quite a few Europeans at the site, whom the lame fate brought to the region.  Three Russians arrived this time: Sergey Gordeychik (I) and <a href="https://twitter.com/repdet">Gleb Gritsai</a> from <a href="http://www.ptsecurity.ru/">Positive Technologies</a> , and also <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/users/alexandrpolyakov/" class="user_link">AlexandrPolyakov</a> from Digital Security. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f5d/2f2/bca/f5d2f2bca0cecd43a8bde13e56840e1d.jpg"><h6>  Poc preparty </h6><br><br>  However, there were much more Russian-speaking people.  From Andrei Kostin (roots src = USSR) to ex-NSA Tom Creedon from iDefence - winner of Drinking Hell. <br><br>  Suddenly, Tao Wan from IBM IBM gave us a stunning karaoke session ("Black Crow", "Moscow Nights", etc.).  So you understand that Russia is a Far Eastern power. <br><br>  <b>Power of XX</b> <br><br>  The conference is held in one stream.  In parallel, in a separate room, several hacker activities take place. <br><br>  In addition to various geek competitions a la blind programming and the battle of overclockers, this year the organizers presented a real surprise - CTF competitions in which only girls took part. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b39/383/7e5/b393837e51e9ca4afdf1390daf7f678e.jpg"><h6>  Here it is, the power of XX </h6><br><br>  I could not personally take part in the competition and assess the complexity of the tasks due to the improper set of chromosomes, but HexView, Burp and OllyDbg on the laptop screens flashed, which is good. <br><br>  The Pussy Cat team won the competition a little overtaking secu. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/766/858/b42/766858b42db21607acd172b707e7a132.jpg"><h6>  Final Scoreboard </h6><br><br>  <b>Reports</b> <br><br>  The conference program focuses on the practical aspects of information security, but the organizers do not adhere to any ‚Äúgeneral line of the party‚Äù and simply include in it the reports of the best experts from around the world. <br><br>  Local features - a number of speeches were in Korean and Chinese, which somewhat complicated understanding.  If it turned out that the slides were a complete hieroglyphic work of calligraphic art, then I could only catch the speakers after the performance, since the site is small. <br><br>  From here a conclusion: we do slides in English. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ada/f35/1f6/adaf351f680d2e48af654d34b19930dd.jpg"><h6>  Synchron? </h6><br><br>  Personally, I really liked the performance of Tao Wan on the Chinese hacker scene (a little more in the <a href="http://t.co/eBnRDX2J">note</a> ).  An excellent bunch of reports was devoted to Windows 8. After Chengyun Chu from Microsoft made a review of the new built-in protection tools for the new OS and stated that it would be very difficult to write exploits for it, MJ0011 demonstrated some workarounds and, as I understand it, mentioned SMEP, with which we have already <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/152365/">played a little</a> . <br><br>  A good report by <a href="http://aluigi.altervista.org/">Luigi Auriemma</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/dntbug">Donato Ferrante</a> on attacks on online games.  A couple of 0day in Call of Duty will certainly interest all cheaters.  For Luigi, this was the first gig on the big stage, and he was a little nervous.  I had to hold emergency advice on the fight against "bad adrenaline."  Hope that helped. <br><br>  Links: <a href="http://www.techhive.com/article/2013725/researchers-uncover-hole-in-call-of-duty-modern-warfare-3.html">http://www.techhive.com/article/2013725/researchers-uncover-hole-in-call-of-duty-modern-warfare-3.html</a> , <a href="http://revuln.com/files/ReVuln_CoDMW3_null_pointer_dereference.pdf">http://revuln.com/files/ReVuln_CoDMW3_null_pointer_dereference. pdf</a> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b8c/d5f/cb6/b8cd5fcb638cc9a94713c29ab0bbe5a7.jpg"><h6>  [Re] Vuln.  Start </h6><br>  By the way, Donato and Luigi decided to unite and organize the company <a href="http://revuln.com/">[Re] Vuln</a> .  It's just great when talented people get together and do something new.  Good luck guys! <br><br>  Andrei Costin changed his <a href="http://live.digitaloctober.ru/embed/1207%3Flanguage%3Den%26params%255Bpw%255D%3D630%26params%255Bph%255D%3D355%26params%255Bepisodes_under%255D%3D1%26params%255Beh%255D%3D100">favorite printers</a> and told about the security system of the dispatcher connection ADS-B.  More precisely about the complete absence of any security system.  The falsification of the coordinates of the aircraft, false reports of problems and the terrorist threat are all available to the non-lazy person. <br><br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DWuqUzr11AEM">Babah!</a> <br><br>  Iron for sale, software - open source.

In addition to a couple of dozens of new vulnerabilities in PLC / SCADA / HMI, including Siemens SIMATIC WinCC, PLCScan utilities, the WinCC Harvester module for Metasploit and the approach of an agentless client-side fingerpring systems with HMI software surfing the Internet based on Surfpatrol were presented.

(at one of the audits of the automated process control system) </h6><br>  Immediately after the speech, we received an invitation to AV Tokyo.  This, it seems to me, is a sign that we have not been wasting the code of industrial systems for good reason and wearing helmets during audits. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/acb/f1c/b64/acbf1cb64e4b54aac4c9c3c5f76e3481.jpg"><h6>  Yes, it's about us </h6><br><br>  Unfortunately, I had to give up the opportunity to speak in the capital of the Land of the Rising Sun, since this week the company Positive Technologies is celebrating its tenth anniversary, and instead of igniting along with the Japanese hacker community, I will have to take the rap in Moscow at corporate party. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f4e/fd2/9e7/f4efd29e7be57f88195500876f9c8fca.jpg"><h6>  Japanese hacker <a href="https://twitter.com/tessy_jp">community</a> ignites </h6><br>  Anyway.  But I saw a booklet about MaxPatrol in Korean, which inspires. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/059/ad1/020/059ad10205b0e0d39b4a438b7a9ad3e4.jpg"><h6>  PT @ Korea </h6><br><br>  <b>Power of community</b> <br><br>  An integral part of any successful conference is a party.  To do this, all conditions were created at POC2012: traditional Korean dinners, formal and informal parties, battles with Benny about the need to drink local beer despite the presence in the Leffe menu ... <br><br>  Unfortunately, I did not manage to fight for the honor of the Russian people in Drinking Hell, I found only preparations. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/3a8/9f3/603/3a89f3603eb00d71b0c7ebc31e99a864.jpg"><h6>  Drinking Hell Under Construction </h6><br>  But Gleb did not disappoint and took the honorable third place. <br><br>  <b>Korea</b> <br><br>  Separately, I wanted to say a few words about Korean cuisine.  For me, a native Khabarovsk who grew up on kim-chi, a ‚ÄúKorean‚Äù carrot and dried squid, not to mention the basis of the student ration - Doshirak, a visit to Korea is the heart and belly feast.  Deliciously fed everywhere, from the "Michelin" restaurant to the street tray.  Although we should not forget that in Korean "tasty" and "spicy" are practically synonymous. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/26b/111/93c/26b11193c09213faebf3c93dbaa85245.jpg"><h6>  Om-Nom-nom! </h6><br><br>  I often hear about the beauty of the Moscow metro.  Friends, you probably were not in the Seoul subway! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/852/ea8/b36/852ea8b36778858e62d8f015a322ee6e.jpg"><h6>  Simple, "ugly" Seoul metro </h6><br><br>  In general, Seoul impresses with an eclectic combination of skyscrapers, Buddhist temples, high-tech gadgets and traditional gymnastics exercises in the subway, on the street and everywhere else ... <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/254/19a/b52/25419ab52bed43d3de3430057d132ba1.jpg"><h6>  Seoul </h6><br><br>  I left POC2012 with lots of ideas, lots of new acquaintances and a little regret.  So everything went great! <br><br>  Many thanks to the organizers and personally <a href="https://twitter.com/vangelis_at_POC">Vangelis</a> , speakers and all participants for a wonderful event! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/8dd/95d/3b4/8dd95d3b4485c862cb01b181a3474df5.jpg"><h6>  Preparing for POC2012 </h6><br><br>  PS In the plane from Seoul to Moscow, Gleb and Alexander <a href="https://vimeo.com/53502739">indulged</a> in a <a href="https://vimeo.com/53502739">little</a> with the multimedia system AirBus. <br><br>  SOMETHING WICKED THIS WAY COME! <br><br>  PPS Several links to articles written based on our report: <br><br>  <a href="http://searchsecurity.techtarget.com/news/2240171014/Report-highlighting-SCADA-insecurities-alarmist-says-ICS-expert">searchsecurity.techtarget.com/news/2240171014/Report-highlighting-SCADA-insecurities-alarmist-says-ICS-expert</a> <br><br>  <a href="http://www.digitalbond.com/2012/11/08/siemens-time-for-code-review-sdl/">www.digitalbond.com/2012/11/08/siemens-time-for-code-review-sdl</a> <br><br>  <a href="http://www.computerworld.com/s/article/9233378/Siemens_software_targeted_by_Stuxnet_still_full_of_holes">www.computerworld.com/s/article/9233378/Siemens_software_targeted_by_Stuxnet_still_full_of_holes</a> <br><br>  <a href="http://www.darkreading.com/advanced-threats/167901091/security/vulnerabilities/240049917/scada-security-in-a-post-stuxnet-world.html">www.darkreading.com/advanced-threats/167901091/security/vulnerabilities/240049917/scada-security-in-a-post-stuxnet-world.html</a> <br><br>  <i>Author: Sergey Gordeychik, CTO, <a href="https://twitter.com/ptsecurity">Positive Technologies</a> .</i> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/159347/">https://habr.com/ru/post/159347/</a></p>
