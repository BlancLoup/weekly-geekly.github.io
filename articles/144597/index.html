  <section class="page js-page"><h1>KVIS - Critical Information Segments</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Dear comrades Habrayuzer. <br>  It is very interesting to read about the methods of critical management, management in unimaginable conditions, when everything and everywhere is not the way we would like.  Therefore, I present to your attention a simple method for determining the Critically Important Information Segments.  I call it simple, because I used domestic (read Soviet) developments. <br><br>  I ask attention under the cat. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The study of narrow (critical) places should be a priority, and to study any subject it is necessary to find a definition that would satisfy the requirements of the task.  Our task is to prevent system failure (downtime, falling profits, etc.).  For the correct solution of the problem, let‚Äôs take as a basis the following definitions, taken, however, from the Russian KVIS method of determination: <br><br>  1. "The part of the infrastructure, which is a combination of physical or virtual systems and facilities, is so important that their failure or destruction can lead to disastrous consequences, is called critical."

      2. ‚ÄúThe critical information segment of the system is a part of the system whose malfunction leads to a decrease in the efficiency of the system below an acceptable level.‚Äù <br><br>  Well ... First of all, it is necessary to draw up a scheme of our, say, telecommunications network.  This scheme is needed to build a graph of connectivity (carrying out decomposition), i.e.  definitions of objects and relationships between them. <br><br>  In this article, to understand that we really need to build a graph, we need to add elements of Clausewitz‚Äôs theory for network architectures (Clausewitz, CV (1832) On War): <br><br>  The German military theorist and historian Clausewitz first began to discuss and create a theory, which was that the center of gravity is a certain ‚Äúcentral point‚Äù around which everything revolves. <br><br>  Nevertheless, the number of such centers of gravity (critical information segments) is small, which is justified by the theory of self-organizing networks (scale-free network) by Alberto Barabashi (Ted G. Lewis (2006). Defending a Networked Nation. Naval Postgraduate Shcool. Monterey, California).  He mathematically proved that large network structures (for example, the Internet, social networks, etc.) that seemed previously unstructured, that is, random, actually have a complex internal organization and are self-organizing with several key ‚Äúhubs‚Äù (implying a key node) or centers of gravity. <br><br>  In accordance with his theory, any unstructured (Poisson) network, under the influence of a set of well-known rules and laws, primarily economic and social, after a certain time (after a certain number of iterations) takes the appropriate structure, without any external influence, organizing around the most valuable or important nodes. <br>  The American mathematician determined that the number of connections (valence or degree) of any node of self-organizing networks subordinate to a power law distribution, showing that the proportion of P (K) nodes in a network that have K-links to other nodes is proportional to (1 / ) n, where the value of the exponent n usually varies between 2 and 3. Similarly, the critical infrastructure can be represented by a network of objects connected in a certain way connected to it, the number of the most important of which is limited. <br><br>  Thus, to study the network, it is necessary to know not only the number of objects within it, but also their interconnection and interaction.  It is such objects, for the mathematical description of which it is necessary to know their structure, and the theory of graphs is studied.  In this regard, the network can be represented in the form of a weighted oriented graph, the vertices of which are objects, and the edges - the connections between them. <br><br>  In our network, the vertices of the graph will be switching equipment, lines of connectivity, respectively, virtual or physical communication channels: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/06b/ec9/9e5/06bec99e58db89258e5256230b0ec6f9.png"><br><br>  In the graph displaying the network, there are 10 vertices and 13 lines of connectivity. <br>  In addition, it is necessary to consider and designate information directions.  This means it is necessary to understand where and where the flow of information goes: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/398/965/b80/398965b80cf8edd607e04807e9f8dd70.png"><br><br>  In our case, these will be directions 1 through 4: <br>  1st direction - information exchange between the top number 1 and number 9; <br>  2nd direction - information exchange between the top number 2 and number 7; <br>  3rd direction - information exchange between the top number 3 and number 10; <br>  4th direction is an exchange between peaks No. 5 and No. 6. <br><br>  In fact, it is very important!  Take and simply visualize the network and directions of movement of information.  Human perception is a very interesting thing - when information is scattered in the head, it is extremely difficult to realize it.  As soon as it is drawn on paper, all the bottlenecks are immediately visible. <br><br>  So now with our graph.  Representing from a regular network, it is difficult to realize the place where you stumble, summarized in the form of a graph - you can already poke a finger into a bottleneck. <br><br>  However, we will not stop, and then we will clearly define the KVIS system: <br><br>  The next step is the definition of the main and backup information transmission routes for each of the information directions.  The main route is a direct path along the graph of the communication system between subscribers of the information direction.  If not present, a workaround with the lowest number of hops is used.  Backup route - a workaround on the graph of the communication system between subscribers of the information direction with the smallest number of hops. <br><br>  For the 1st informational direction it is: <br><br>  The main route: edge 2 - top 4 - edge 6 - top 6 - edge 10. <br><br>  There are several backup routes: <br><br>  a) edge 1 - top 2 - edge 3 - top 4 - edge 5 - top 5 - edge 9 - top 10 - edge 13; <br>  b) edge 1 - top 2 - edge 3 - top 4 - edge 7 - top 7 - edge 11 - top 8 - edge 12; <br>  c) edge 1 - top 2 - edge 3 - top 4 - edge 8 - top 8 - edge 12. <br><br>  Total: for direction No. 1, the critical segment will be top No. 4. How can this be determined on the basis of the task, and not simply by poking a finger into a ‚Äúnarrow‚Äù place? <br><br>  In the following way, the criterion of attribution to critical is applied to each of the information segments: if the failure of a given information segment can lead to a lack of coherence in the main information direction provided by it, then it is considered to be the critical information segment of the network being analyzed. <br><br>  If we generalize for all informational directions, it turns out that the failure of vertex number 4 is a universal catastrophe of this system!  Even the practically independent information direction No. 4 will need to increase the leverage of information delivery by 2 times! <br><br>  This is how simple it was, proved the existence of a bottleneck to yourself and someone else (the boss, for the purchase of backup equipment). <br><br>  The article used materials: <br>  1.

Kondratyev, KVN, ‚ÄúCurrent Trends in the Study of Critical Infrastructure in Foreign Countries‚Äù, Foreign Military Review 1.2012; <br>  2. ‚ÄúMethodology for determining the KVIS of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation‚Äù, NGSh Armed Forces, 2004; <br>  3.
