To take advantage of Alexander's experience, we decided to talk about such a popular trend as <i>start-ups</i> . <br><br>  <i>Please tell us about yourself: how old are you, how long have you been on the Internet, including as a developer?</i> <br><br>  Years - 33, in the runet of the year from 97 as a user, and also as a ‚Äúdeveloper‚Äù, too, he dabbled in creating websites for his friends.  The hands made about 40 sites.

    <a name="habracut"></a>  <i>Now you are " <a href="http://alexgriffin.ru/">Man Brand</a> ".</i>  <i>What preceded this?</i>  <i>Which projects have been successful?</i> <br><br>  This entry is connected with Runet half - my main activity since the year 93 is related to marketing and branding.  Of the successful campaigns, the Epson ad campaign in '98 - after the crisis, we did not achieve growth, of course, but no decline.  There was a program of small-size outdoor advertising, and of course on the Internet, <a href="http://www.odnoklassniki.ru/">classmates</a> .  Although everywhere it is a collective work. <br><br>  <i>What was your very first project?</i> <br><br>  The very first successful advertising project in which I participated (albeit then run errands) - ‚ÄúLyonya Golubkov‚Äù. <br><br>  <i>Yes, the project is successful, everyone knows Lenya Golubkova.</i>  <i>By the way, since we are already talking about Odnoklassniki - who was the author of the idea and inspirer of the project?</i>  <i>How many people are involved in it now, if not a secret?</i> <br><br>  The author of the project and the most important classmate is Albert Popkov.  But classmates for me rather passed stage, so let's talk about something else. <br><br>  <i>All right, come on.</i>  <i>Now startups are a very popular topic and many people are concerned about the same question: how to create a successful startup?</i> <br><br>  Oddly enough, but for this it must be done.  After all, a very large part of conversations about good (and bad) ideas ends with conversations.  In the small remnant of people who are still doing something, especially in the field of Web 2.0, if you look at it, in fact most of the projects are still successful in fact.  Another question is that even the complete capture of the niche for which the project was made (intentionally or accidentally) does not satisfy the creators' ambitions.  This is the notorious orientation to "Everyone" ... <br><br>  <i>Does this mean that, say, a social network for anglers or skiers is likely to be much more successful than a high-tech network for everyone?</i> <br><br>  It is obvious!  Moreover, technology cannot be a source of pride in the network (excluding networks for technology fans). <br><br>  <i>Let's touch the topic of money in projects.</i>  <i>Does a startup have to provide for monetization at the idea stage or can any popular project be made profitable after the fact?</i>  <i>And immediately a cross question: does it make sense to start up in the Russian-speaking segment or ‚Äúthere is no money in the runet‚Äù?</i> <br><br>  Of course it depends on the project.  Of course, there are projects that are ‚Äúhard to raise‚Äù (these are high-tech projects. The most difficult for ‚Äúknee‚Äù projects is the stage of active growth of interest - you need your servers, wide channels and round-the-clock support. You need to be ready for it. In Runet money sea. While the barrel will cost as it should - you can not worry. <br><br>  My assumption that a startup is better to take money here, but if there is an idea that has a chance of success there, then you need to sell it there.  Although there are ideas that are not in any runet or them.  They are the most profitable, but they are almost impossible to get money - neither there nor here. <br><br>  Once again, it should be a clear niche. <br><br>  <i>Alexander, I want to clarify, if there are ideas that are not available either in RuNet or abroad, and they are the most profitable, then why is it impossible to earn money on them?</i> <br><br>  I did not say it is not possible to earn money - it is almost impossible to get money from them at the idea stage.  Just an investor with nothing to compare.  Finding an investor with a similar intuitive feeling is difficult :) The investor still prefers clear math ... <br><br>  And you can earn money on them as much as possible! <br><br>  <i>By the way, which way do you think is the most correct: promotion of the project on your own (with money of friends, relatives, using loans) and subsequent monetization of popularity in your favor, or minimal technical implementation of the idea and subsequent attraction of investors or sale of the project?</i> <br><br>  Again it depends on the size of the niche.  We must remember that the investor does not care about how much you have invested before.  So if a niche is big and you plan to take a serious share in it, it‚Äôs better to own.  If not, the sooner an investor appears, the better.  Strictly speaking, it is worth knowing before the first dollar is invested - this is part of the project development strategy. <br><br>  <i>Maybe there is a universal algorithm for growing a successful startup?</i> <br><br>  There is such an algorithm.  If you are doing what you love, a number of people (offline) and a project on the network do not exist for you besides you - there will be a successful startup.  I suspect that niche lovers knit or make wooden crafts are free. <br><br>  <i>Interesting!</i>  <i>Alexander, if you step back a little to the side - what do you say about the need for offline education?</i>  <i>How important is it to create successful startups?</i>  <i>Can a total "Internet reading" and a serious passion for his work replace it?</i>  <i>And at the same time - who would you advise young people who want to create a second google to study, so that it is not ‚Äúin the box‚Äù?</i> <br><br>  Education and erudition - the essence of different things.  I suspect that psychological or marketing education will be the main success factor.  But it may well complement the natural ability to communicate with people.  All projects are people, their good and bad mood.  And every day you need to be able to motivate yourself, the team, investors ... <br><br>  I am convinced that, say, Churchill, or Napoleon, or Zhukov, exactly at their level of knowledge about network technologies, if they had to do it not by one successful project.  Of course, we must remember that luck loved them to smile.  And this is an important part of great success. <br><br>  <i>Gold words.</i>  <i>;) Do you consider social networks as an effective way to promote a brand?</i> <br><br>  Yes, they can and should be.  But if the network receives an offer of partnership with a well-known brand after it has been created, then network marketers should remember that they risk more than a brand. <br><br>  <i>Alexander, do you associate your future with the Internet or do you consider it as a platform for implementing media plans?</i>  <i>By the way, how would you like to see the Internet in a year or two?</i> <br><br>  Definitely binding.  Moreover, I think that soon this will be the main platform for the implementation of media plans.  I would like to see what it will be like - we all shift the vector of its development every minute.  I hope there will be projects with my participation in it. <br><br>  <i>Sure, we will wait for your projects!</i>  <i>Now you are ready to share the most immediate plans?</i> <br><br>  There are plans.  A lot of their own and a lot of proposals for joint work.  As soon as something will be available for sound, I will tell you right away. <br><br>  <i>Your opinion about Habrahabr is very interesting.</i> <br><br>  A uniquely pleasing interface that won the intricacies of the structure.  Only then appreciated the quality of materials.  I read daily. <br><br>  <i>Today is the day of aviation and astronautics.</i>  <i>I can not ask a related question.</i>  <i>In your profile, marked the enthusiasm for airplanes.</i>  <i>Are you flying?</i>  <i>Where does this passion come from?</i> <br><br>  Passion since childhood.  From grandfathers.  I fly in Kubinka.  Less often than I would like ... By the way, I really hope that suborbital flights will be in the near future - I want to try the passion! <br><br>  <i>Such a passion worthy of respect!</i>  <i>Say hello to the UFO on occasion;)</i> <br><br>  Be sure to pass :) <br><br>  <i>Would you like to say something more for Habr?</i> <br><br>  And I wish Habra to clearly adhere to their niche, to fight the desire to please everyone!  But while it is - I blow on the water, Habr so far in this sense only pleases. <br><br>  <i>Cross your fingers.</i>  <i>Thank you so much for the interview!</i> <br><br>  Cross it!  Thank you! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/6746/">https://habr.com/ru/post/6746/</a></p>
