You do not know how such bikes are arranged. </h4><br>  Look closely at the <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/170379/">previous topic</a> .  Henry Ford - studied engineering from childhood.  His sister once said that in childhood they tried to hide any toy from him, because he would immediately disassemble it into small screws.  He worked as an engineer at Edison Electric Company, was co-owner of the Detroit Automobile Company.  He knew exactly what it was - a car.  He knew exactly the technical details.  He knew for sure that black paint dries for two days, and any other for two weeks!  Well, not because of a whim, he once said that the car would only be black.

      Igor Sysoev, before making his nginx, already had "quite a good experience with Apache - both as a system administrator and as a programmer." <br><br>  Do you know what you have to create your bike?  Or just ready to plunge, without checking the depth of the reservoir? <br><br>  Somehow, at the request of our customer, we implemented a mailing list that sent news to registered users.  And what was the surprise of our customer when, after the first such mailing, he was blocked as a spammer.  I had to dig further, but in the end it turned out that it was much easier to integrate with some <a href="http://eepurl.com/vde8T">MailChimp</a> or <a href="http://unisender.com/">UniSender</a> and not reinvent the wheel.  Not only is everything there thought out, but there are also reports - how many have read, how many have clicked on links, how many have clicked "unsubscribe" and other very important points that a customer who asked "make us able to send news to our users" may want to immediately after the implementation of the basic functionality. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><h4>  Reason 2. Your money is enough only to buy a finished bicycle. </h4><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/7f8/c0a/198/7f8c0a198af0bef838ecd2303a31bae0.jpg"><br><br>  Yes, sometimes it is very difficult to tell people that there is a big difference between buying a ready-made GT Avalanche and setting up the conveyor on which this Avalanche will be made.  Plus design, technology, marketing. <br><br>  <i>Usually we use the example of the BMW X6, but since the topic is about bicycles, let it be GT.</i> <br><br>  But it‚Äôs okay, if people make a high-tech product, they have already experienced it well, but people can still be found (for example, programmers) who will say that you need to make your bike, because without them your product will be the same as everyone will tell about Google, which allocates (or allocates?) up to 20% of time for free creativity. <br><br>  Here comes the next, more fundamental question. <br><br><h4>  Reason 3. You are working on a completely different product. </h4><br>  What are you working on at all?  What is your plan, what is your strategy?  Will this bike really be one of the key features of your product?  Or just a small feature? <br><br>  Do you have a convenient service for finding jobs?  So focus on innovation exactly in this direction!  And if all that comes to your mind is to make another mailing list, then maybe it is worth it at all to postpone the creation of such a startup?  Distract yourself, explore competitors.  In the end, to think about the main issues - the motivation to purchase and the ability to apply the product, the ability of the product to settle down in a real environment, to draw up visual graphs comparing the product being created with its competitors.  Or stop fooling yourself - say that you are not doing a job search service at all, but a new mailing service. <br><br>  The more effort will be invested in achieving the main objectives of the project, the greater the likelihood of success.  After all, Google does not spend 80%, but only up to 20% of the time for experiments.  Not more.  And not 20% for one bike, but 20% for all bikes.  The remaining "more than 80%" is spent on achieving the main goals of Google. <br><br>  Do you think Ford made its wheel?  And the light bulb? <br><br><h4>  As a conclusion </h4><br>  Our customers sometimes look at us with surprise when we ask them similar questions before starting work.  And it seems that in this way we reduce the amount of work, and that we are interested in just the opposite.  But it is not.  There is a common karma.  And you need to work on the overall result.  If, after doing your work in the world, chaos has diminished, or at least there has been a way to create a more efficient environment for life in this world, this is success.  A deep understanding of the goals and strategy of the product, their acceptance and participation in planning is the only way to achieve joint success when you are trusted much more than just ‚Äúcode‚Äù. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/170745/">https://habr.com/ru/post/170745/</a></p>
