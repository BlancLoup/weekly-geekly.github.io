Instead of water in this case, a special liquid is used.  According to the TV channels, this is a ‚Äúsecret Russian development‚Äù. <br><br>  The author of the invention is Corresponding Member of the Russian Academy of Natural Sciences (Russian Academy of Natural Sciences), KMN, winner of the Society of Shipbuilders of Great Britain Andrei Filippenko.  He has been involved in this project since the times of the USSR, and now he has finally achieved a demonstration at the highest level. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  At a special demonstration, an experiment with flooding a dachshund dog was conducted by two scientists for the President of Serbia, Alexander Vucic.  It was just one of the innovative Russian developments that Vuchich was shown by Deputy Prime Minister Dmitry Rogozin.

      During the experiment, the dachshund was placed in a flask with a special liquid saturated with oxygen.  To do this, scientists had to try a lot, because the dog was actively resisting. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ee/_v/-w/ee_v-wuw7_fuzpxrpuhc-bxrhug.jpeg"><br>  <i><font color="gray">Two scientists are trying to cram a dachshund into a flask of fluorocarbon liquid</font></i> <br><br>  After about 10 seconds, they tried to extract it, which also proved to be difficult - in the end, the dachshund was pulled out by the hind legs.  In general, the dog's head held in the liquid for about 20 seconds.  Having gotten a practically motionless dachshund, it was lowered upside down over the bath - and the fluid that had got into the lungs was drained.  Then wiped with a towel.  When the dog completely recovered, she was shown to journalists and officials as evidence that she really ‚Äúbreathed‚Äù under water.  Vuchich stroked the dog and noted that he was impressed by what he saw. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/jt/n0/0l/jtn00lrn_bgnvmztmnfjerrwu5w.jpeg"><br><br>  In an interview with RenTV channel, Andrey Filippenko <a href="https://ren.tv/novosti/2017-12-19/prezidentu-serbii-pokazali-v-moskve-kak-taksa-mozhet-dyshat-pod-vodoy">explained</a> that the liquid "is like water, it is transparent and colorless, but consists of carbon and fluorine." <br><br>  The first thought may be that Andrei Filippenko is referring to tetrafluoromethane (chemical formula CF <sub>4</sub> ) is one of the simplest fluorocarbons.  In particular, this substance is used as a component of breathing mixtures during deep-sea diving.  When tetrafluoromethane is in contact with the flame, toxic gases are produced in excess of oxygen;  in the presence of water, hydrogen fluoride is obtained (in the H <sub>2</sub> F <sub>2</sub> dimer), a colorless mobile volatile liquid, which mixes with water in any respect with the formation of hydrofluoric (hydrofluoric) acid.  According to the encyclopedia, photohydrogen forms an azeotropic mixture with water with a concentration of 35.4% HF. <br><br>  In addition to tetrafluoromethane, there are <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259F%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580%25D1%2584%25D1%2582%25D0%25BE%25D1%2580%25D1%2583%25D0%25B3%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B2%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B4%25D0%25BE%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B4%25D1%258B">other fluorocarbons</a> .  Their formulas are similar to hydrocarbons, only all hydrogen atoms are replaced by fluorine atoms, as in the case of tetrafluoromethane (an analog of methane CH <sub>4</sub> , only with fluorine instead of hydrogen). <br><br>  Higher and especially <b>polycyclic fluorocarbons have an abnormally high ability to dissolve gases</b> , including oxygen.  Actually, it is this chemical property of polycyclic fluorocarbons that a scientist from the Russian Academy of Natural Sciences could try to use.  But if we consider that he has been conducting experiments since the times of the USSR, that is, about 30 years, we can assume that these experiments were mostly unsuccessful. <br><br>  What exactly Filippenko invented is difficult to say now, because he did not tell the details of his invention, but he could not find any scientific papers on this subject of his authorship. <br><br>  According to representatives of the project from the Foundation for Advanced Studies, the use of such a liquid could save the lives of the crews of sunken submarines.  From a depth above 100 m it is impossible to quickly rise to the surface due to a caisson disease, but ‚Äúif you fill a person‚Äôs lungs with this liquid, they will not shrink, which will allow you to quickly rise to the surface‚Äù. <br><br>  ‚ÄúThe technology here is very interesting,‚Äù said Andrei Filippenko.  - Indeed, it is very important for underwater affairs.  And here I can say that we are ahead of the rest. ‚Äù <br><br>  The research is financed by the Advanced Research Foundation from the Russian budget.  Representatives of the Foundation say that the technology has a lot of other applications: it is the rescue of premature people, help for people with burns of the lungs.  And if a scuba diver has such liquid in cylinders instead of oxygen, this will significantly increase the time of his being under water and ‚Äúallow him to dive into previously unseen depths‚Äù.  The project is led by Fyodor Arsenyev. <br><br>  Representatives of FPI also explained that the main problem in fluid breathing is psychological.  For such a "breathing" the first thing you need to choke, that is, to collect fluid in the lungs. <br><br>  Rogozin stressed that this is only one of the FPI projects.  There are others: ‚Äú(It is) the very same day where we are striving,‚Äù the deputy chairman of the government noted. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/374109/">https://habr.com/ru/post/374109/</a></p>
