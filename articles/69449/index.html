      ... It all started with the fact that my girlfriend Dasha and I realized my insane dream: we took a car (together) from Moscow all the way to Bergen (west of Norway).  Our autotravel came out just mega-rich in impressions and events that happened to us!  We did it, yeahhh!  Then I started a blog on WordPress and described there in several volumes (work on 50-60 pages of text only) our adventures, richly ‚Äúspiced up‚Äù the description with unusual beauty photos of Scandinavian nature and so on.  I got a great mass (by the standards of my humble blog) a lot of enthusiasm reviews, and then I got excited about the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãbanging up a resource ‚Äî a community of autotourists, where dear like-minded people could find all the information they were interested in on autotravel, post reports and just chat. <br><br>  I took CMS <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/livestreet/59319/">LiveStreet 0.3</a> , twisted and turned (as far as I had enough skills and abilities) and put my idea into practice - I created the <b>Autotourists Community</b> . <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  I began to actively attract visitors, both with the help of search engine promotion, and with the help of the group I created on Vkontakte (which is no secret? I want to monetize the resource in the future).  Gradually began to gain some audience.  Someone even began to lay out their reports, to which I am extremely happy.  Still would! <br><br>  But here I began to notice that many users of my habra-like resource are often lost in its use;  they can‚Äôt figure out how to insert a picture or video, then they write the record in drafts instead of publishing it.  In short, they sometimes admit blunders that seem ridiculous to us, and a stupor to them.  This is understandable: the theme of "autotourism" implies that the majority of visitors are already mature enough.  As I can judge, 60-70 percent of my audience is people over 40. So they don‚Äôt understand some elementary things for us, active users of everything and everything in the internet, things like this: ‚Äútags‚Äù (for them it‚Äôs ), "Cat", "collective blog", etc., etc. <br>  But if someone doesn‚Äôt have a relationship with a resource, then he might think that the problem is in the resource, not in him, and run away and / or not return to it. <br><br>  It begs immediately: ‚Äúhow about you, boy, are you dealing with help and usability?‚Äù.  Answer: I have not yet delivered myself in an exclusive design with a ‚Äúclear‚Äù arrangement of buttons, and no sophistication on usability;  The help tried, however, to write exhaustively (and, admittedly, he gave his small result). <br><br>  Here I would like to ask: wasn‚Äôt anyone on their projects the task of ‚Äútransferring‚Äù users from already familiar to all (who are older than Pavel Volya) forums for blogs, habra-like software statues?  Are there any tips &amp; trics, such as, for example, more than ‚Äúmodest‚Äù in their skills, the 57-year-old Internet user to teach, translate and addicted to something unusual for him? <br><br>  I am glad in advance of informative comments and I ask you not to kick, if something is written not in the local spirit - this is my first post here.  Thank. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/69449/">https://habr.com/ru/post/69449/</a></p>
