  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Trolling and trolls (on how to make a classification and select groups)</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"> Tired of the abundance of ‚Äúanalytical‚Äù articles devoted to such a social phenomenon as trolling, I, frankly speaking, once again made a portrait of the average network dweller and became thoughtful - how much is a classification of this phenomenon possible?  Naturally, in 99% of the articles I have seen, the classification didn‚Äôt even try to suffer at best by remaining at the level of ‚Äútroll off-complexed - uncomplexed troll‚Äù, and at worst - at the level of ‚Äútroll good - bad troll‚Äù.  Naturally, on the basis of such a classification, it is almost impossible to deal with this phenomenon. <br><br>  In addition, I believe that this article will be useful to anyone who in one way or another tries to approach the issue of classification from a scientific point of view.  Based on it, you can get an idea of ‚Äã‚Äãhow to deal with the classification, and it will be useful to you even if you have seen all these trolls and non-trolls in a coffin.  You can assume that this is an article on the theme of the scientific classification of the phenomenon on the example of the "trolling" phenomenon. <br><br>  The topic is in the blog ‚Äúlearn to work‚Äù simply because you already learn, damn it, to make classifications! <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  So, at present we have a superclass of all inhabitants of the Network, which we need to classify - ‚Äúusers of the network‚Äù.  We will push off from the definition published in Wikipedia, because as it is most often referred to, and, thus, it is generally accepted.

      Trolling - placing on the Internet (in forums, in Usenet newsgroups, in wiki projects, LiveJournal, etc.) provocative messages aimed at causing a flame, conflicts between participants, insults, and the like. <br><br>  In order to determine the subject of conversation, it is necessary to understand what is involved in the definition and highlight the main species characteristics. <br><br>  So, a troll is a person who does trolling.  Thus, it is determined by the following features: <br>  1. stirs provocative messages <br>  2. aims to cause a flame, conflicts between participants, and the like - we will call it ‚Äúdestructive goals‚Äù <br><br>  Thus, in order to be able to call a person a troll, one should prove that the message he left is provocative, and the purpose of posting this message is destructive.  After realizing this fact, we select four subclasses in the superclass ‚ÄúNetwork users‚Äù, each of which we will call according to the behavior model: <br><br>  1. Do not leave provocative messages and do not pursue destructive purposes - Visitors <br>  2. Leave provocative messages, but do not pursue destructive purposes - Morons <br>  3. Leave provocative messages and pursue destructive purposes - Trolls <br>  4. Do not leave provocative messages, but pursue destructive goals - Intrigues <br><br>  Further, in the class "trolls" we need to allocate subclasses based on generic characteristics.  To do this, you should consider the definition again and determine the motives and aspirations.  That is, to ask by definition the questions "for what" and "because of what." <br><br>  So, the troll posts provocative messages to commit destructive actions.  For what? <br><br>  In order to answer this question, it should be understood that destructive actions are deliberate and unconscious.  Conscious is when a person is purposefully engaged in the destruction of his own habitat, and unconscious is when he cannot foresee the consequences of his actions.  Deliberate trolling immediately stands out in a separate category, divided into sub-categories ‚Äúpersonal‚Äù (when I hate the owner of the resource and try to destroy it) and ‚Äúcustomized‚Äù (when I carry out destructive actions at someone‚Äôs request), the unconscious shares further. <br><br>  Man unconsciously engaged in destructive actions within their own habitat.  Since he has no destructive goals, it should be assumed that his goals are constructive within his paradigm of worldview and build a number of assumptions about them. <br><br>  The assumption is quite simple.  A person may assume that the habitat management is not effective enough, and, without having the appropriate authority, he is trying to implement in this way self-regulation and regulation of the content and population in accordance with personal quality criteria.  So, for example, Linux may assume that there are too many Windows users in Habr√©, which for some reason nobody minus, and will actively flame with them, trying to achieve minuses in their direction.  This is a kind of super-goal of the unconscious trolling - to bring the habitat in accordance with its imago (the ideal reflection of the environment in the mind). <br><br>  Depending on what a person does not like in the process of habitat, trolls can concentrate on: <br><br>  1. Posts (down with VKontakte with Habra!) <br>  2. People (down with DailSoft with a habr!) <br>  3. Comments (Down with the first ones from the Habr!) <br><br>  And so on, depending on the type of resource. <br><br>  So, we made the classification by goals, now we have to make the classification for reasons.  So, the troll posts provocative messages to commit destructive actions.  Why? <br><br>  Here it should be understood that we are no longer talking about goals, but about causes.  The reasons are internal installations that lead a person to the idea that this model of behavior is effective.  Let's try to classify them. <br><br>  So, personal attitudes can likewise be conscious and unconscious.  Conscious personality installations are when a person believes that trolling is the only effective tool for achieving his goals (see ‚Äúfor what‚Äù), unconscious ‚Äî when trolling is a result of any personality installations, complexes or phobias. <br><br>  Naturally, all the trolls' personal attitudes ultimately boil down to complexes.  However, do not rejoice.  Complexes - this is something that exists in a huge amount from any person, they just can not always be correctly recognized and analyzed.  And if you are not a troll, this does not mean that you do not have any complexes, and (which is the worst thing), that you are somehow better than a troll. <br><br>  Conscious personality installations most often boil down to the fact that a person himself experienced the effect of trolls on himself or his own friends and saw how this could be an effective tool.  Unconsciousness is traditionally reduced to an inferiority complex, a deeper classification will require special knowledge from readers, so I will not give it. <br><br>  Thus, we obtained two parallel classifications: <br><br>  Target level: <br>  1. Conscious (target) <br>  1.1.  Personal <br>  1.2.  Customized <br>  2. Unconscious (social conflict) <br>  2.1.  The failure of the communication model <br>  2.2.  Failure to adopt behaviors <br>  2.3.  Failure of tradition <br>  2.4. ... <br><br>  Causal level: <br>  1. Conscious (effective) <br>  2. Unconscious (frustrated) <br><br>  By crossing the classifications, we get 4 categories to which all trolls can be attributed. <br><br>  1. Troll effective target.  Trolling for him is a business, nothing personal.  He has excellent skills in tricks and it is incredibly difficult to recognize a troll in him.  He is cold, calm and calculating.  If you are sure that you see just such a troll in front of you - immediately ban it, otherwise after a while your entire forum will lie in ruins. <br><br>  2. Troll frustrated target.  Trolling for him is a sublimation of his own complexes, for which money is paid.  Most of all he looks like a stripper who, at the age of 14, was small, fat and disliked by girls.  He adores his favorite work and always does it enthusiastically.  Naturally, he is much more emotional than the previous type, often loves to "flirt" with the "victim" and its inhabitants, sometimes does not hide his own craft.  But all this should not prevent you from making the only correct decision in the event of the discovery of such a troll - a ban. <br><br>  3. Troll effective social conflict.  In terms of D &amp; D, this type is best described by the Chaotic Good combination.  He firmly believes in what he understands better than many, what people need, and acts according to this attitude.  In his vision of habitat, ideally square people walk along ideally square streets while sipping a perfectly square cocktail from a perfectly square mojito.  If you see such a person - do not rush to ban him, first talk to him.  Practice shows that if your worldview coincides - you will get just the perfect moderator who will be devoted to you for the rest of his life.  Well, or until it changes, or your life paradigm.  Remember that all the problems are due to the fact that he has no other regulatory tools, and maybe he deserves to receive them. <br><br>  4. Troll frustrated social conflict.  Most similar to the epileptic adolescent, and, often, it is.  For him, trolling is revenge for his own insults and problems.  The most numerous class, richly represented in the network - this includes including the trolls who do this "for fun" (in an unsportsmanlike manner).  If you help him get rid of his own problems - then he will soon become a normal user, because trolling is not his fault, but his misfortune.  He is an alcoholic, and the attitude towards him should be appropriate.  If you can't help him, break his relationship with your habitat by taking Banhammer in your hands. <br><br>  However, in our group there are two more categories of people who stand not far from the trolls, but, nevertheless, they are not.  They are not easy to distinguish from the real trolls, and therefore it should be understood what they are similar and how they differ. <br><br>  1. Morons.  Often, the moron seems from the frustrated social conflict troll, but it is not.  The moron is not an alcoholic who suffers from being hostage to his own affection, but rather a teenager who drank a bottle of vodka for the first time in his life.  He does not take revenge on anyone for his own insults and complexes, he just sincerely does not understand you.  Perhaps he lacks some knowledge, maybe his parents did not teach him to behave in society, but the reality is that he does not provoke a conflict, he really wonders what the essence of the problem is.  Explain to him, give references to the relevant literature in a personal or in private - he will be only grateful to you. <br><br>  2. Intrigues.  An intriguer is a highly effective, effective troll that is polished to a shine and is good at what you can, ‚Äúwear out without undressing‚Äù.  This is a person of a thousand guises, he can successfully present himself as anyone, disguise himself as anything, and say whatever he wants.  He is able to say ‚Äúthank you very much‚Äù so that the moderator will not stand and ban him - after which he will be removed from his post for exceeding his authority.  That is why the conversation with such should be extremely short.  A huge problem is that they are almost impossible to recognize.  And the best part is that these practically do not exist. <br><br>  By the way, a side effect of classification is the acceptance of the fact that a troll can be not only a person, but also a program.  Why?  Think about it at your leisure. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/73530/">https://habr.com/ru/post/73530/</a></p>
