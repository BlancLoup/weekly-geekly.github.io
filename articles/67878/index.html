  <section class="page js-page"><h1>NETGEAR Network Assistants</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  A pair of computers, a pair of laptops, a pair of network drives for different purposes, an HD player, a printer - the number of network consumers at home began to grow, there were not enough free holes in the old 100-megabit switch.  Having estimated on paper a new lokalki scheme, I tried to solve the problem of its scaling. <br><br><img src="http://boomburum.ru/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/95.thumbnail.jpg" alt="image"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Shortly before that, I posted a post on my local forum, asking for help with setting up such a network device like <b>ASUS WL-600G</b> .  Do not consider it an advertisement, but the device is really interesting, however, without waiting for a solution to the problem, it was accidentally dropped on the floor, after which he ordered everyone to live for a long time.  Though I work in Asus, they don‚Äôt distribute free routers there) By the way, I wasn‚Äôt told how to configure this damn NAT so that the Internet from the network wire from the dashboard was distributed to all devices (NAS downloaded torrents, and the working computer I was always in touch) and that at the same time Wi-Fi would work for the laptop, phone and communicator.  After skylink it was so that only one of the devices worked with the Internet. <br><br>  One of the drawbacks of this ASUS was the fact that there are only 4 network holes in it, one of which will immediately be occupied by the main, Internet-carrying wire.  Those.  in fact, for everything about everything, there are only 3 holes and by no means do without a switch for 4-8 holes.

      I decided to rummage in the <a href="http://netgear.com/Products.aspx%3Ffor%3DAll">devices</a> from the NETGEAR company, the network drive from which I recently <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/hardware/60850/">surveyed</a> .  They bribed relatively low prices, ease of setup (judging by the reviews) and a huge choice, which for me is not unimportant, identical in design of devices. <br><br>  From a huge list of products I stopped at the <b>NETGEAR WGR614v9</b> wireless router and the <b>NETGEAR GS608</b> switch, which resulted in a total of only 3,000 rubles!  For comparison, the same is only one ASUS WL-600G. <br><br>  Recalling the labeling of network drives from NETGEAR, he drew an analogy to network devices: <b>GS608</b> - <b>G</b> igabit <b>S</b> witch with <b>8</b> ports;  <b>WGR614</b> - <b>W</b> ireless- <b>G</b> <b>R</b> outer <b>4</b> ports. <br><br>  Devices are completely identical in design, so that, speaking of one, you can safely imagine the other. <br><br><h3>  Equipment </h3><br>  The package bundle is also similar, each box had: <br>  - The device itself (NETGEAR WGR614 and NETGEAR GS608, respectively); <br>  - Two legs to install the device in a vertical position; <br>  - AC adapter to power the device; <br>  - Network wire (1.5 m); <br>  - Installation disk; <br>  - Instruction. <br><br><img src="http://boomburum.ru/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/25.thumbnail.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Devices lay in boxes, in special cardboard frames. <br><br><img src="http://boomburum.ru/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/16.thumbnail.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h3>  Appearance </h3><br>  The dimensions of the devices (in mm) are 28 √ó 175x118, weight is 250 grams.  In general, on the Internet, devices look a little scary) or unusual, perhaps ... however, I did not take this into account, because  I saw the devices in real life in advance and knew that everything was fine.  Such is the ‚Äúcorporate style of clothing‚Äù - streamlined snow-white forms, along the perimeter of which (top and bottom), with a small interval, there are small indentations, which in the pictures look like stitches with threads.  In fact, this is nothing more than decorative elements, except that, when installed in a vertical position, the legs themselves are inserted into these ‚Äústitches‚Äù. <br><br>  They snap into place so that they hold the device securely vertically, even if you stick a lot of wires in them. <br>  From above, except for the "dotted line" and extruded inscriptions (guess what?) There is nothing.  On the front and sides there is a single transparent plastic part, behind which all the LEDs, inscriptions and so on are hidden. <br><br>  There is a slight difference - in the router the substrate is white, and in the switch it is chrome plated.  I liked the first one more.  At the bottom - a schematic depiction of the device with a little explanation and 4 rubber feet - in case the device will just be put on the table. <br>  From the back of the switch - 8 RJ-45 ports and a power connector, nothing more. <br><br><img src="http://boomburum.ru/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/56.thumbnail.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  At the same router - power connector, 4 network ports, 1 yellow port for connecting the cable ‚Äúwith the Internet‚Äù, a small grille with a <b>Reset</b> button (reset to factory settings) hidden in it and, where without it, a small antenna turns 360 degrees and deflected. <br><br><img src="http://boomburum.ru/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/37.thumbnail.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  I wanted, of course, to put the device, but looking at the place where they would live, I decided to use the legs.  No sooner said than done. <br><br><img src="http://boomburum.ru/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/84.thumbnail.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h3>  Turn on and work </h3><br>  When you turn on the devices, they are ideally lit bright lime indicators, otherwise the orange icons, which all their appearance hint that everything is bad with the grid.  By the way, everything was fine with me) <br><br>  I connected the wire to the router, to it - the switch and the 3 most important devices (popcorn, working comp and working NAS).  To the switch - everything else. <br><br><img src="http://boomburum.ru/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/65.thumbnail.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  I scroll through the instructions, launch the browser, enter the coveted IP-address, username and password.  Before me, there is a standard admin panel for such devices - I immediately change the supervisor password, specify the login and password for the PPPoE connection.  Waiting for all this to continue.  Iii ... all my devices were immediately in the internet!  ) Ie  I did not make any additional settings, everything was set up in a couple of clicks! <br><br><img src="http://boomburum.ru/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/1.thumbnail.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Then I went through the settings - turned on Wi-Fi, set a password, changed the security settings.  He pointed out that the router worked in the DHCP server mode, but reserved two addresses for the working computer and the NAS.  Then I saved the settings in a separate file and refreshed the device with the latest firmware (I had to start exploring the menu from the end), restoring the settings after that.  Port forwarding for a humble servac (HFS) so that it can be seen from Ineta. <br><br><img src="http://boomburum.ru/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/26.thumbnail.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Of the interesting features of the admin - you can block unwanted sites by a flexible scheduler by keyword;  view connection statistics; <br><br><img src="http://boomburum.ru/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/6.thumbnail.png" alt="image"><br><br><img src="http://boomburum.ru/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/7.thumbnail.png" alt="image"><br><br>  There is a function of a wireless repeater, but I have so far only one such device at home - by the way, there was a stable maximum signal throughout the apartment.  There is also the possibility of remote control of the router.  All the settings pages on the right side of the screen have a huge column with text explaining each item. <br><br>  I am writing this review 2 months after the launch, for the time being, not even the slightest shoal (unless the power was turned off once and the default settings went off - I downloaded from the file and connected the devices to the back-up box, wondering why I didn't do it right away).  Otherwise, everything suits me completely.  Speed ‚Äã‚Äãtests are not satisfied, because  channel total megabit) <br><br>  What was surprised - the signal on the netbook (no PDA) is weak, but it is caught from the street from the car, if it stands under the window.  We are playing with a friend in a night challenge around the city (riding in search of signs on the instructions), often have to search for something in the internet - we drive up to the house, press buttons and leave) helped more than once. <br><br><h3>  Wireless Router Features </h3><br><br><img src="http://boomburum.ru/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/45.thumbnail.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>Routing protocols</b> : Static and dynamic TCP / IP routing, VPN pass-through (IPSec, L2TP), NAT, UDP, RIP-1, RIP-2, PPTP, PPPoE, DNS, DHCP (client and server). <br><br>  <b>Application Support</b> : Supports most online gaming, instant messaging, and UPnP-enabled applications for automatic Internet access. <br><br>  <b>Functions</b> : Smart Wizard to automatically determine the type of ISP (static, dynamic, PPPoE), Exposed Host (DMZ), MAC address authentication, content filtering by URL, e-mail alerts about Internet access. <br><br>  <b><u>Interfaces</u> :</b> <br>  <b>WAN</b> : 10/100 Mbps (with automatic speed detection), Ethernet RJ-45. <br>  <b>LAN</b> : 4 ports 10/100 Mbps (with automatic detection of speed), Ethernet RJ-45. <br><br>  <b><u>Wireless connection</u></b> <br>  <b>Network speed</b> : 1, 2, 5.5, 6, 9, 11, 12, 18, 24, 36, 48 and 54 Mbit / s (with automatic speed detection). <br>  <b>Modulation type</b> : OFDM with BPSK, QPSK, 16QAM, 64QAM, DBPSK, DQPSK, CCK. <br><br>  <b>Firewall</b> : Stateful Packet Inspection (SPI), detection / registration of DoS attacks, registration of lost packets, registration of security events and e-mail. <br>  <b>Encryption</b> : 40-bit, 64-bit, 128-bit and 152-bit (802.11g only) WEP encryption. <br>  <b>Antenna</b> : 2 dBi. <br>  <b>Warranty</b> : NETGEAR warranty for 2 years. <br><br>  <b>pros</b> <br>  - Small size, pleasant overall appearance of the devices; <br>  - Clear admin with a bunch of installations, support for the Russian language. <br>  - Easy to set up and yet reliable operation; <br>  - WGR614 has been specially developed for Russian providers, which eliminates common problems with connecting to the Internet or the provider's local network. <br>  - Low price (1500r per device). <br><br>  <b>Minuses</b> <br>  - Not yet found. <br><br><h3>  Total </h3><br>  For most readers, the above described is not a discovery at all, for myself I solved a problem that tormented me long enough and, which is nice, I did everything myself) Yes, now everyone is talking about 802.11n, but I still have devices for it No, there will be - we will think of something. <br>  Devices are nice in appearance, elementary in the settings, but at the same time, very functional.  Add to this a small market value and as a result we get a very good product. <br><br><img src="http://boomburum.ru/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/75.thumbnail.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>Successes!</b> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/67878/">https://habr.com/ru/post/67878/</a></p>
