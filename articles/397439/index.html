  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The development of the Internet of Things and the renewal of the package of mobile operators</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Until recently, mobile operators (MOs) offered mobile Internet access and voice services.  As a result, their networks were designed for use by users' personal devices, including smartphones, laptops, and tablets.  However, MoDs now need to prepare to start offering a new type of service on the market as part of the Internet of Things (Internet of Things, IoT) concept, which includes devices that previously didn‚Äôt have developed network capabilities, ranging from multi-functional sensors and smart utility meters companies, ending cars and trucks with Internet connection manufacturers of machines and logistics companies.  New scenarios for the use of IoT appear almost every day, which provides opportunities for business development both for the IO and the IoT platform providers. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  According to Gartner, by 2020 there will be almost 21 billion devices in the world supporting the concept of the Internet of Things.  It does not matter whether this figure is accurate - some experts think that it is too high (in fact, Gartner lowered the forecast over the past few years) - MOs should be prepared for an increase in the number of devices using their networks.  This will require a fundamental review of the infrastructure that will be able to efficiently handle the increased load.  If this is not done, IOs will not be able to attract IoT users, which will reduce loyalty to them when it comes to providing voice communication services and mobile Internet. <br><br>  <b>IoT Infrastructure Requirements</b> <br><br>  In addition to increasing traffic, MOs should consider that IoT devices may not communicate in the way that smartphones and computers do.  Some IoT devices exchange small amounts of data and quickly disconnect from the network.  Such devices include smart meters (for example, gas or electric).  They transfer the latest readings to a centralized data repository.  On the contrary, cars connected to the Internet can exchange not only diagnostic information with the central hub, but also offer broadband mobile access services for embedded information and entertainment systems, which will create a large amount of traffic over a long period of time.

      These differences in the behavior of the end IoT devices create different requirements for the network and the data center, which deals with the processing and placement of information.  For example, 4G networks are ideal for vehicles with advanced network capabilities, but using them for utility companies may not be practical.  For such systems, a low bandwidth channel is required, access to which requires a minimum voltage.  Some IOs are already engaged in low-power WAN (LP-WAN) deployment, including LoRa and Sigfox.  They will work in parallel with traditional 3G / 4G networks designed for IoT systems that require low bandwidth and low voltage to save the battery life of IoT devices for several years. <br><br>  For data centers, the adoption of cloud technologies is of utmost importance.  It is very important to be able to quickly deploy a virtual environment that will offer network functionality and an IoT platform in accordance with each specific IoT usage scenario.  In order to achieve and maintain the continuous availability of IoT applications and keep up with the pace of deployment of new IoT projects, companies must ensure that their cloud infrastructure is working reliably and can adapt to changing conditions. <br><br>  <b>Preparing for IoT concept deployment</b> <br><br>  In general, the service provider industry has advanced significantly in the process of creating infrastructures and services with IoT support.  As already mentioned, several service providers are already deploying LP-WAN networks in addition to existing 3G / 4G networks.  The consolidation of infrastructures is also in full swing, which allows not only reducing overall costs, but also offering new services much more quickly, because  Networks have become easier in the process of this consolidation. <br><br>  In the first IoT adaptation projects, service providers introduced cloud technologies, including Network Functions Virtualization (NFV), to create infrastructure components that will support IoT usage scenarios.  NFV is the concept of a network architecture in which entire classes of functions of network nodes are virtualized by creating structural elements that can connect or form entire chains to create scalable communication services. <br><br>  NFV was originally designed to reduce the capital and operating costs of service providers.  Now they are considering NFV as a solution for the provision of new services and faster adaptation of existing ones.  In an environment where IoT systems place different demands on the network and supported applications, NFV-based solutions will become necessary for service providers who want to enter the IoT market. <br><br>  <b>Few last obstacles</b> <br><br>  The era of the Internet of things is approaching, and service providers have the opportunity to actively participate in the development of this concept.  Service providers will be able to offer basic radio services for IoT devices, however many of them want to participate more actively and offer full IoT platforms.  Although modern cloud infrastructure and the introduction of NFV technology provide a proper basis for new services, service providers still face a number of unresolved issues. <br><br>  Connecting IoT devices is one thing, and protecting devices and applications is another.  Service providers have begun to increasingly focus on information security in the light of the latest cybercrime attacks.  And it also made many companies more cautious about entering the IoT services market. <br><br>  And maybe this is not so bad.  Ultimately, we, as users (companies or individuals), will only benefit if the networks and infrastructure have a high level of protection. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/397439/">https://habr.com/ru/post/397439/</a></p>
