Roskomnadzor is an authorized state agency for the implementation of the ‚Äúanti-piracy law‚Äù No. 187-FZ. <br><br>  As a result of the check, five computers were seized from the Yenisei administration. <br><br>  According to the department, which came to Roskomnadzor from law enforcement agencies of the Krasnoyarsk Territory, unlicensed copies of Photoshop were found on the two computers seized. <br></blockquote><br>  Read more: <a href="http://gov.cnews.ru/top/2013/08/02/policiya_nashla_piratskoe_po_na_kompyuterah_roskomnadzora_537687">gov.cnews.ru/top/2013/08/02/policiya_nashla_piratskoe_po_na_kompyuterah_roskomnadzora_537687</a>

      Under the cut, I want to think about how to live further and where is our SPO ... <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Actually, nothing surprising, the fact that everyone has known for a long time, but the mention in the press already makes us think about the eternal question - ‚ÄúWho are the judges?‚Äù.  The most important thing to blame for this - <br><br><blockquote>  Roskomnadzor believes that they "could have been installed several years ago by employees who no longer work in management." </blockquote><br>  again the mythical employees of which no one has seen or knows.  Although if it was any commercial organization, I think the perpetrators would have been found long ago. <br><br>  The fact of using unlicensed in state institutions is far from being the first, and here we recall the remarkable document ‚ÄúPlan for the transition of federal authorities and federal budget institutions to the use of free software‚Äù and highlights the period of open source software in state institutions from 2011 to 2015 <a href="http://filearchive.cnews.ru/doc/2010/06/17/2299p.doc">filearchive.cnews. ru / doc / 2010/06/17 / 2299p.doc</a> (dada, document on the transition to open source software in doc format).  I would like to ask, just not with whom, but what was actually done and how to continue to live? <br><br>  Go through a couple of points: <br><blockquote>  1. Development and approval of recommendations on the composition of qualification requirements for the professional knowledge and skills necessary for the performance of official duties by federal civil servants in the use of information technology, taking into account the peculiarities of working with the basic free software package </blockquote><br>  Judging by recent initiatives of the same Roskomnadzor, one can make a bold conclusion that no one worked on this point.  By the way, the wording again leaves a lot of questions, because here we need clear and not ‚Äúrecommendatory‚Äù requirements. <br><blockquote>  7. Approbation of the basic free software package in pilot organizations - federal executive bodies and budget institutions II quarter 2012 </blockquote><br>  I communicate quite closely with the specialists of the local administration, I myself go to budget institutions, no one even heard about it ... <br><blockquote>  11. Development and approval of a list of data storage format specifications and data exchange interfaces that must be supported by software developed and purchased for its use in federal executive bodies, in particular, for the use of free software </blockquote><br>  ODF approved, but when communicating by e-mail, I never saw a document in this format with the same government agencies. <br><blockquote>  19. Conducting an inventory of information systems of federal executive bodies and assessing the resources required for the transition to free software IV quarter 2011 <br></blockquote><br>  Actually to the question of the first part of the topic, if the inventory was carried out by whom and how, that was not found not used unlicensed software. <br><br>  It is possible to touch upon more than one point, but I think the picture as a whole is already clear, but one cannot speak about the fact that no work is being done.  Personally, in my city I see how government institutions are switching to electronic document circulation, introducing new technologies where they didn‚Äôt want to hear about them before, but all, absolutely all innovations use commercial software, and sometimes even unlicensed ones.  From simple examples - crypto-provider CryptoPRO, local state institutions were given an order to register on long-suffering public procurement for placing orders, while the local treasury issued licenses for CryptoPRO 2.0 which simply does not work on Win7, therefore options 2, either delete legally acquired copies of the OS or install illegal CryptoPRO, guess what path they took ... And it's sad, because now a lot of money will be spent on implementation and maintenance, and then what?  ‚ÄúThis song is good - start from the beginning.‚Äù I still want to see the real movement in the direction of open source software in state institutions, and maybe even commercial ones.  And in the survey below I want to know the opinion of the community on this topic. <br><br>  PS I apologize for the confusion, but it was painful ... </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/188940/">https://habr.com/ru/post/188940/</a></p>
