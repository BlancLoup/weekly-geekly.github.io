The specified procedure for the collection of fees applies to the selected applications. <br><br>  <b>2. Benefits for fees for international patenting</b> <br><br>  2.1.  <b>An applicant who is a natural person</b> and a citizen of the country from the <a href="http://www.wipo.int/export/sites/www/pct/en/fees/fee_reduction.pdf">special list</a> (Russia is included in it) is entitled to a <b>90% reduction in the international</b> filing fee (the total fee is US $ 1,471 plus US $ 17 for each sheet of the application set of documents over 30 sheets with a good application usually $ 2,000 to 3,000).  In addition, an applicant who is entitled to a 90% reduction in the international filing <b>fee does not have to pay a transfer fee</b> (the fee is 850 rubles when filing an application to Rospatent as a receiving office or 111 US dollars when filing an application to the International Bureau in as the receiving Office) with respect to the international application filed with the International Bureau as the receiving Office.  The same rule (i.e., a 90% reduction in the international filing fee and exemption from payment of the transfer fee for an international application filed with the International Bureau as a receiving office) applies to the applicant, regardless of whether he is a natural person or not, citizen and residing in a state that is classified by the United Nations as the least developed country. <br><br>  <i>It should be noted that nothing prevents you from submitting an international application, specifying the Russian individual as the applicant - the sole inventor or natural or legal person from the least developed country and save on international duty, and then change the applicant to the required legal entity and, if required , adjust the composition of the authors.</i>  <i>The change of the applicant and the composition of the authors of the international application is possible before the expiration of 30 months from the priority date.</i>  <i>It is better to change the declarations of the international application within 16 months from the priority date, in which case the publication of the international application will be completed with changes.</i>  <i>The fees for introducing changes to the application and declarations of the international application or the payment of the international duty in this case are not stipulated by the rules of the Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT).</i>  <i>Things you can use legally.</i>  <i>True, there is a feature: you need to be 100% sure that with such an applicant it will be possible on acceptable terms to enter into an agreement on the alienation of the right to receive a patent.</i>  <i>Such an agreement may request the receiving office in the international phase or the national patent office in the national phase.</i> <br><br>  2.2.  <b>If Rospatent, acting as an international search authority, uses the results of a</b> previous international search, an international type search or other <b>search conducted by it</b> , for which reference is made in the application, the fee for establishing the level of technology to assess the patentability of an invention and compile a report on an international search (fees for search) and fees for establishing the level of technology for assessing the patentability of the invention and drawing up a report on the international  In the case of a breach of unity of invention for each part of the international application that does not relate to the invention mentioned first in the claims (additional search fee) (the full amount of these fees: if the clerical work is in Russian - 6,750 rubles. in another language allowed under the Patent Cooperation Treaty - 28,000 rubles) shall be <b>reduced in the following amounts:</b> <br>  <b>in the amount of 75%</b> - if no additional search is required; <br>  <b>in the amount of 50%</b> - if the additional search is confirmed by documents relating to one or two additional subgroups of the International Patent Classification; <br>  <b>in the amount of 25%</b> - if the additional search is confirmed by documents relating to new aspects of the claimed invention (for example, the international application is based on several earlier applications, and a search report on one of them is used). <br><br>  These are the main opportunities for reducing duties, one way or another related to Russia.  It is clear that in each country there are specific ways.  In addition, these possibilities have a number of legal subtleties.  Therefore, as they say, consult a specialist before use. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/288428/">https://habr.com/ru/post/288428/</a></p>
