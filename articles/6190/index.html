  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Cybersquatters spread on Cyrillic domains</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The excitement around the Cyrillic domains, inflated by domestic registrars at the beginning of this year, seems to have turned out to be an ordinary scam.  The rules for registering Cyrillic names in the national RU domain, published in January, certainly should not be taken as the final version.  However, on the item about graphically similar domains, users just in case responded with new registrations in order to stake out a solid place for themselves as soon as the Cyrillic alphabet is launched.  They wanted to cheat - but only the recorders were quicker. <br><br>  Last December, TelNews wrote that the registration of Russian-language domains might well begin in early 2007.  Many difficulties and questions have traditionally been associated with non-Latin domain names, in particular, serious concerns were attributed by the Coordination Center of the RU domain to graphically similar domains.  Many Russian words can be written in Latin letters and vice versa.  Domains such as MOSKVA.RU pose a threat of phishing - the possibility of the appearance of fake counterparts of already existing sites or mailboxes.  It was obvious and the administration of the national domain, so the famous clause 4.4 was added to the Rules. <br><br>  Its essence lies in the fact that the administrator of graphically similar domains - Latin and Russian-speaking - can not be different people.  Accordingly, the owner of the correct combination, composed of letters of the Latin alphabet and registered as a domain name, can later easily claim the Cyrillic domain.  Registration of traditional domains in the RU zone was and remains a reality, while Russian-speaking domains are only a project with not very clear prospects.  Nevertheless, the ‚Äúcunning‚Äù point, which was trumpeted all over the Runet, was noted by farsighted users.  Before the official launch of Cyrillic, the registration of graphically similar domains went uphill.

      At the same time, Sergei Sharikov, the head of Regtime, called paragraph 4.4 a gate with the inscription ‚ÄúWelcome!‚Äù Addressed to cybersquatters.  When most of the interesting ‚Äúsimilarity‚Äù domain names were registered, market participants suddenly remembered that this item, it turns out, limits their rights.  Last week a meeting of the Committee of Registrars was held at the Coordination Center of the RU domain.  Svetlana Prozorova, representing the Domain Registrar company, protested against the current version of the Rules concerning the registration of Cyrillic names in the national domain.  As a result, all registrars, with the exception of RU-CENTER, unanimously expressed themselves against the launch of Russian-language domains.  The idea of ‚Äã‚Äãintroducing the Cyrillic alphabet in a separate IDN TLD.RF, in close cooperation with ICANN, found considerable support. <br><br>  ‚ÄúIf a TLD is Russian-speaking, for example, RF., The problem of phishing does not arise at all.  Therefore, the registrars adopted this option for the national domain in Cyrillic.  TLDs in national languages ‚Äã‚Äãhave long been operating in China with the support of the government.  In the near future, official registration with IDN TLD in Korea and Israel is expected, ‚Äùsaid Sergey Sharikov, a strange decision of the Committee. <br><br>  ‚ÄúThe mistake (and possibly a deliberate action) was the publication of the Rules long before their entry into force.  In December 2006, immediately after the publication of the new Rules, a surge in the registration of graphically similar domains was observed.  The purpose of such registrations is the same: while Russian-language domains are not yet available, you can register a name written in Latin in order to qualify for a ‚Äúgraphically similar‚Äù Cyrillic version.  Today, according to our data, over 2,000 graphically similar domains have been registered, most of which were registered in December 2006 - February 2007, ‚Äùsaid Andrei Vorobyov, head of the public relations department of RU-CENTER. <br><br>  According to him, the advance publication of the Rules led to the fact that by the time the Cyrillic alphabet was launched, all the attractive graphically similar names would have been occupied in the RU zone.  Understanding this, the registrars simply canceled the start of Russian names in the national domain, inventing a zone. RF.  Andrei Vorobiev believes that he will have to wait another five years. <br><br>  telnews.ru </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/6190/">https://habr.com/ru/post/6190/</a></p>
