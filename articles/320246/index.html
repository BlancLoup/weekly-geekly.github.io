  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Designer folder designer. Create backups</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/01d/f39/a6d/01df39a6d0bc4b37a172ef2f203a2695.png" alt="image"></p><br><p>  After studying the comments to the <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/post/319296/">previous post</a> about the project folder, I decided to restructure the process associated with the versions of files and their storage.  Smart people said that in our time it is wrong to duplicate files manually, creating an archive of versions, but we need to use modern Git, Subversion and the like technologies.  In this post I will write about the system to which I came and now enjoy using it.  I became calmer, I eat better and sleep better, because now I‚Äôm not at all worried about working files and their safety.  It remains to be a good designer. </p><a name="habracut"></a><br><p>  There are a lot of solutions for saving file versions.  For me, as a designer, the key parameters are the following, which the system must meet: </p><br><ol><li>  I myself have to determine at what point to create a file recovery point; </li><li>  Have the opportunity to see what has changed in the file (most often in graphic); </li><li>  Download the file and its versions in the online storage; </li><li>  Get unlimited storage of files and their versions; </li><li>  Privacy  The data, without my knowledge, should not be accessible to outsiders; </li><li>  Low cost. </li></ol><br><h2 id="dropbox">  Dropbox </h2><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/356/c27/64d/356c2764d2b24ff69f869a0be905cf8c.png" alt="image"></p><br><p>  Yes, yes, do not be surprised.  I did not know, but Dropbox can keep a history of file changes.  A very convenient solution for storing and accessing files from anywhere in the world.  It‚Äôs easy to share materials and you don‚Äôt need to think about downloading them; it‚Äôs enough to install an application that will upload files and edit their files.  But this plus is also a minus, since new versions of files are created automatically after each save.  Secondly, it is impossible to compare what exactly has changed in the file, without rolling it back.  Without the purchase of an additional ‚ÄúExtended Version Log‚Äù (EVN), which costs 40 bucks a year, files are stored only for 30 days.  Free give 2 GB, the rest for a monthly payment of $ 8.25.  We get at least 140 dollars a year and not full compliance with the requirements.  We go further. </p><br><h2 id="google-drive">  Google drive </h2><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/3eb/b96/176/3ebb9617625147c6a04b5a5e3ca9fb54.png" alt="image"></p><br><p>  All the same advantages and disadvantages as Dropbox.  But in Google Drive more than 30 days, the version is not stored in principle, which is unacceptable.  Immediately miss. </p><br><h2 id="invision">  Invision </h2><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/719/2e4/397/7192e4397c414f99aa3acde924bdc5ab.png" alt="image"></p><br><p>  The second discovery I made was preparing this post (thanks to <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/users/snight/" class="user_link">SNight</a> for the tip).  A service that is familiar and loved by many designers is still able to store versions of files.  For this you need to use their utility - "Desktop sync app".  You do not need to pay anything extra.  Of the minuses - there is no preview for Sketch files and no interaction for users who want to use "Inspect Mode" is not thought out.  The fact is that for the code inspection to work, the layouts must be loaded via the ‚ÄúCraft‚Äù plugin.  And then a conflict arises, because  The ‚ÄúDesktop sync app‚Äù does the same thing, but does not ‚Äúparse‚Äù the layout according to its components, so the ‚ÄúInspect Mode‚Äù is not available to it.  You have to choose between the version history of the file and the code inspector.  Because in our team, the code inspector is used by layout designers and programmers ‚Äî the choice is in favor of Inspect Mode. </p><br><h2 id="cornerstone-3">  Cornerstone 3 </h2><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/05c/be9/468/05cbe9468fb24bf5bd9b88a9a970e207.png" alt="image"></p><br><p>  Apparently, the most popular subversion solution for Mac.  Very beautiful program.  Of the minuses - there is no storage in the cloud.  You can, of course, place folders with files and backups in the directory of a third-party cloud service, such as Yandex.Disk.  But there is a second minus - the cost of $ 69.  Not to say that it is very expensive and I was ready to try working with the program (there is a trial period of 14 days), but I noticed another drawback - there is no preview of the Sketch files.  Take a note, but look for more. </p><br><h2 id="github">  Github </h2><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/811/6cf/008/8116cf008e9e41a495bd74f2f841e2d8.png" alt="image"></p><br><p>  This solution was used earlier when I was actively engaged in layout.  Meets all the requirements that I described above.  There is a desktop client, which is important for those who do not own the command line.  Private repositories (online storage) are paid, from $ 7 per month.  A great option, but not perfect. </p><br><h2 id="bitbucket">  Bitbucket </h2><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/977/99f/a41/97799fa41e0f407a9347b5660baabbbf.png" alt="image"></p><br><p>  I settled on the Bitbucket repository in conjunction with the SourceTree client.  Bitbaket I preferred GitHab for free private repositories.  Moreover, I can create as many as you like, and even invite up to 5 users to work on the project.  If more than 5 users are connected to the repository, then you need to pay from $ 10 per month.  In general, a great offer. </p><br><h2 id="sravnitelnaya-tablica-izuchennyh-resheniy">  Comparative table of the studied solutions </h2><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/2f7/16b/d2b/2f716bd2b5e24281ae7ad78b9fc41e2e.png" alt="image"></p><br><p>  Now I will tell you how the work process is organized. </p><br><p>  First of all, we register on <a href="https://bitbucket.org/">www.bitbucket.org</a> and download <a href="https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/">SourceTree</a> (available for Mac and Windows). </p><br><blockquote>  By the way, SourceTree can also be used as a client for GitHub. </blockquote><p>  Start SourceTree and add a new project ‚ÄúNew Repository‚Äù ‚Üí ‚ÄúCreate Local Repository‚Äù. </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/6e2/f06/a91/6e2f06a915054663be04670a74a5304e.png" alt="image"></p><br><p>  Select the directory where the project and archive of its versions will be stored.  Since I save the files also online, I check the ‚ÄúAlso create remote repository‚Äù checkbox. </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/5d8/2a2/b52/5d82a2b52e9640b1b2f55b6653d6df18.png" alt="image"></p><br><blockquote>  You can not upload files online, and create a repository only on your disk or in the directory of a cloud service.  Then you will not depend on either the GitHub or the BitBacket. </blockquote><p>  Now put some file in the created folder.  Let it be a photoshop file hello.psd.  After saving the file to the folder in SourceTree, a notification appeared that the directory has changed, and to the right is a small thumbnail of the contents of the file. </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/213/03c/ebe/21303cebe502417fa98582755a7d3721.png" alt="image"></p><br><blockquote>  If the file is larger than 5MB, then the preview will not be shown.  To decide to open Preferences ‚Üí Diff.  Set "Size limit (binary)", for example 50,000 KB.  Previews are created without restrictions. </blockquote><p>  This will happen after each change of files in the directory or adding new ones. </p><br><p>  Create a "Restore Point" (In Git terminology, this point is called Commit).  To do this, select the files for which a version will be created in the repository (I usually select everything), write a comment and click ‚ÄúCommit‚Äù to create a restore point. </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/8f8/b9f/e4c/8f8b9fe4ced24950acdeca8824822fc1.png" alt="image"></p><br><p>  Is done.  Now we can always return to this file in this form. </p><br><p>  Recolor the title to a different color and save.  SourceTree noticed the manipulations and in the preview window shows 2 images of "It was" and "It became". </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/16f/266/975/16f266975b234d3299521580e53a4f68.png" alt="image"></p><br><blockquote>  PS I could not find how to make the preview larger, if one of the experts advises, I will be grateful.  The coolest thing is that the preview is created even for Sketch files, which is mega-cool and no other program can be viewed. </blockquote><p>  ‚ÄúLet's commit‚Äù the changes and send it to the server. </p><br><p>  For the purity of the experiment, we will make a third edit, sending it to the server and her. </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/775/78a/800/77578a8007f2469a888e25eba590f519.png" alt="image"></p><br><p>  Did you need to ‚Äúroll back‚Äù to the first version of the file, or take a couple of layers from there?  Let's try.  Go to the sidebar of the program in the ¬´History¬ª tab and select the first commit.  If you double click on the preview, the first version of the file will open in Photoshop.  We take from it any layers or re-save as the main file.  It is very convenient and simple. </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/8b0/c65/e3a/8b0c65e3a5964419ba5307a99599c101.png" alt="image"></p><br><p> I described the basic functionality provided by Git technology.  There is a lot more there, but even with this functionality, you can not be afraid for the safety of working files and their iterations. </p></div>
