The soul is empty, and in the Apple app store the smoke stands like a rocker.  What is there just not.  The local Cheka cleans the shelves and the developers receive letters. <br><br><blockquote>  Dear friend <br>  Your app King Towers is outdated and we remove it from our store. </blockquote><br>  And so on the letter once a week.  Applications, dear to me as a memory of distant Obj-C, I tried to quickly rewrite Swift.  But here, another rocker was waiting for the hero.  Xcode 8 entered the house with the new wife Swift 3.0.  From the old bird code, nothing worked anymore.  Having cost two mice, I was able to cut the text in half (do I become a programmer?) And mastered the bird language for the third time, but the new misfortune - all the converted applications did not start.  Do you know why? <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h3>  Pictures-viruses </h3><br>  Because you can not be so happy.  Apple decided that jpeg and png files store a hidden threat in the form of executable code.  What is it ?!  Therefore, it is necessary to clean the attributes of image files from old and new projects. <br><br>  For this, I use the command (I had to become a little Unix-oid)

But on the nose of 2017. They, that Habr do not read?  Is it still npm? <br><br>  Ok, back to the remote games.  There is also good news - discarded applications can be updated!  I downloaded new versions of old programs.  I admit, not all versions were approved - the Review Team actively began not to miss new versions of banned applications.  But 3 times I managed to publish completely converted programs. <br><br><h3>  Switch to Swift 3.0 </h3><br>  The old swift code is automatically converted to the new language;  Xcode asks for your consent for this operation.  I will not give examples of how everything has changed.  Okay, one show: <br><br><pre> <code class="cs hljs"><span class="hljs-comment"><span class="hljs-comment">// Swift from 20 century groundObama.layer.borderColor = UIColor.redColor().CGColor // Swift 3.0 groundTrump.layer.borderColor = UIColor.red.cgColor</span></span></code> </pre> <br>  Not difficult, but sometimes you get puzzled.  And even you are discouraged.  At the same time ... well, there opens a wide topic, and I wanted to tell about the new game idea. <br><br>  Let me just say that I like the new language. <br><br><h3>  Google strikes back </h3><br>  From October 1, Google delighted us with another letter - all your games with the old adMob.framework now do not bring money to the creator.  That is, if you made a free application with an advertisement from Google and it turned 2 years old - that's it, cranking, finish, fiasco - this product no longer makes money.  This is incredible!  That is, Google itself refused 30% of the revenue from these applications.  I did not believe it, but it is a fact - instead of $ 50 a day from October 1, I began to receive only 20. Disaster.  I immediately rushed to update the old successful programs.  I did not sleep 2 nights.  broke 18 keys.  In the meantime, revenues have returned to almost the same level.  Not 50, but you can live.  Nevertheless, I recommend everyone to jump on the new adMob engine. <br><br>  And so, while I frantically copied old games, a new idea occurred to me. <br><br><h3>  New idea </h3><br>  No need to laugh, I came up with a cool game.  I think you will like it too.  Why am I writing here about the game?  Copyright, brothers, copyright.  I hate copyrights and everything mine is yours. <br><br>  But sometimes it's a good idea to stake out an idea in order to boast of past achievements in front of the girls in the brasserie.  Or any bore on Habr√© suddenly starts to doubt your genius. <br><br>  In Soviet times, I used a copyright trick with the USSR mail; you send a registered letter to yourself - in a letter a diskette with a code and a listing.  The letter is not opened and after 20 years you throw it away (the diskette crumbled into dust, for sure).  But, in which case (hello to Clinton), in court you can prove who the real father is. <br><br>  Now everything is easier - you publish an article on Habr√© and voila, you sleep peacefully.  I was once helped by the publication on Habr√© (November 2011) and the case was won.  Cognac drunk. <br><br>  So, I'm talking about a new idea of ‚Äã‚Äãa puzzle game.  First, just watch the gameplay video. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XpM6E1V_7XQ" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  The game is called Kremlins and made by me in the style of Russian nesting dolls.  Nesting dolls fold into each other, the goal is to collect all 6 nesting dolls and solve another puzzle.  The assembled matryoshka is removed from the board.  The rules for folding nesting dolls are amazingly simple - you can put the matryoshka dolls of the same color on each other.  Easy, right?  Have a nice weekend. <br><br>  It turned out not bad, I downloaded a million layouts, prepared a server with two mysql tables and a pair of php scripts for storing the best results. <br><br>  He made the game quickly, tried to put it under the name of one of the deleted applications - but Review Tim did not miss the next version.  Like, too many changes.  Release under the new name.  I released.  By the way, if you are an Android developer, you can release a clone of the game in no time. <br><br>  A big plus in the modern apple store - applications are considered very quickly and approve of the day.  No weeks waiting.  I made the first version of the game paid and even received 30 purchases, which is unbelievable!  Usually 0. I apologize to customers. <br><br>  Because today a new free version has been approved, and I dared to publish this opus.  Good luck and have a good weekend! <br><br>  We have 22, Indian summer. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/312756/">https://habr.com/ru/post/312756/</a></p>
