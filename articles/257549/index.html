  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How I went to the clouds</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  It took not so long ago in order to deploy a service for testing to get at their disposal a virtual machine in the cloud.  It is desirable for free.  For a long time. <br><br>  Posherstil many resources, including Habr.  And I did not find a detailed review of "what, how and how much."  So the idea was born of writing this article on the results of an independent search.  Many cloud computing providers provide free ‚Äúprobes‚Äù for a certain period.  Finding information in search results bit by bit, I found and tested several of the providers. <br><br>  The article will discuss how to get at their disposal a virtual machine (or several) from such providers as Google, Microsoft, HP, and in the future others.  There will also be a small comparison. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Possessing a level of paranoia above average, I didn‚Äôt want to enter the data of my real bank card on any websites.  And the majority (no, that is, ALL) providers require them, before they allow to try their services.  In the end, I decided to use for this purpose a virtual card of one well-known payment system - and it worked out, well, almost.  So let's go.

    <h4>  1) Microsoft </h4><br>  Started with Microsoft Azure.  Logging in first to live.com, registered mailbox outlook.com.  Funny thing: the registration is soft and unobtrusive, but after trying to send any email, you are asked to confirm your account via SMS, thus linking your mobile phone.  Well, the practice is well known.  I have already prepared a mobile phone specially for such purposes: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ba9/79d/24f/ba979d24f0154a17b8e15845410b9b10.png" alt="image"><br><br>  So, the live.com account is received.  Go to account.microsoftazure.com and click on Get Free Trial. <br><br>  Registration includes 4 points, each of which is a mini quest.  Our task is that everyone should be marked with a green checkmark of Complete.  Enter information about yourself.  Then we proceed to the verification of the phone (what to do, it is not enough for them that the phone is already attached when registering mail). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/14e/67d/66c/14e67d66c88d4a53ad04f495bc7a6c23.png"><br><br>  After successfully entering the SMS code in front of item two, the cherished complete appears and the form for entering card data opens.  We enter. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e34/586/5aa/e345865aa77146e6a4615dcca35238d0.png"><br><br>  Click on Sign up and get complete, after which we are asked to wait: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/021/b65/b4f/021b65b4fd204fe498f74dcf7a51519f.png"><br><br>  After some waiting, the site asks to re-login again and, finally, the cherished instance management console opens: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/21a/6df/6bf/21a6df6bf09c4585a47c876d15973874.png"><br><br>  Creating instances (ie, virtual machines) is intuitive.  You can choose an image for deployment of those that Microsoft experts carefully prepared for us.  And then click "Create a virtual machine". <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/45f/b6e/144/45fb6e1444c947bdbe4b3b7ee17668f9.png"><br><br>  We are waiting, waiting and once again waiting for the image to unfold - and, voila!  We can walk on it on rdp. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/7e4/e25/17a/7e4e2517aa6b4026b76472700ddab98c.png"><br><br>  The only BUT, if you, like me, are an adherent of old versions of Windows, you will have to suffer a little.  Since  on the instance, for Network RDP sessions, the Network Level Authentication check is enabled by default, and without fail.  This means that if you have a client of old versions (even WinXP SP3), then you will not be able to connect, the server will simply generate an error.  Personally, I came out of this situation, temporarily engaging the RDP client with Win7 available to me.  Then reconfigured the instance so that the NLA check is not mandatory. <br><br>  After that, you can do whatever you want with the instance!  Legally, of course.  You have $ 300 for expenses and a month for tests.  Well, then - pay (or go through the whole quest with a new fake registration). <br><br><h4>  2) Google cloud </h4><br>  Go to cloud.google.com.  Click the Free Trial and get to the registration page. <br>  Where kindly enter your data: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/6e6/2b1/94d/6e62b194d1204a28ae2990d8d5188e34.png"><br><br>  After that, we are immediately passed into the creation of instances. <br>  We drive in the name, the location of the virtual machine (I chose closer: europe-west1-b).  Well, and the type of machine, I for my modest needs more than the n1-standard and do not need. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/25b/d5e/4a2/25bd5e4a2d8044c29ff9548c29fdcf92.png"><br><br>  But then you need to decide from which image a virtual machine will be created.  I wanted to see how the Google server would work.  Available only server-2008-r2.  He chose. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/9f4/a88/4e5/9f4a884e5ade47e29fb3ac32c9f9b087.png"><br><br>  Next we drive in the username, password of the admin account.  And go to the cherished Networking. <br><br>  Here we are offered a static IP, white, fluffy, which is accessible from everywhere.  And this is very cool.  But if you untie it from a specific instance and it will simply be assigned to your account, they take a bribe, a small one.  Yes, and not so important, Google gives us as much as $ 300 and a whole 60 days to try. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f46/f5c/0cb/f46f5c0cba7f4011a3c08a95fc85aea7.png"><br><br>  After clicking on the Create button and some waiting, our machine is available to connect via RDP, and there are no such difficulties as in MS with NLA - we connect from everywhere and without problems. <br><br>  Problems arose later.  When I deployed my project (vpn) inside the instance, the remote machines for unknown reasons for me could not even go to each other via ssh, pings were skipped, but otherwise the network was freezing.  I experimented with the settings of Google's virtual network adapter; there it is called Red Hat Networking.  But did not succeed.  In the end, I decided everything by switching to the Unicode instance of the virtual machine from Google.  In this case, a similar problem did not arise with the cloud service from Microsoft, for them the Windows worked like a clock. <br><br>  Plus, "Google" is that in all 60 days I can not remember a single reboot.  That is chic uptime.  At Microsoft, in 30 days, it was at least once when everything had to be reconfigured. <br><br>  In general, summarizing, I can say that the cloud free (trial) hosting of your services, for testing purposes, of course, has the right to life!  Yes, and feel how it really works was nice and useful. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/257549/">https://habr.com/ru/post/257549/</a></p>
