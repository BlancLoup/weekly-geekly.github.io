  <section class="page js-page"><h1>A simple programmer once again on Google Glass</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Already having written this text, the author, in search of another article, entered into the Google Glass search engine and was amazed at the number of results in recent months.  It is completely obvious that the reader has become boring to the reader and should cause irritation, but not interest.  The author realizes that, probably, it would be worth writing to the hub ‚ÄúI am indignant,‚Äù but, unfortunately, he went somewhere irretrievably. <br><br>  In case the topic has become as boring as you, I have removed from the post all the pre-downloaded pictures of the ill-fated points.  If you can‚Äôt even read about them, boldly pass by - the author understands you deeply.  The author will be very happy under the cut to the few remaining hack readers. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  According to the author, the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãsuch a device organically looks on the pages of the worlds of the Strugatsky brothers, as the whims of technology millionaires (which, to the proper extent, are the founders of Google), but not as a revolution in the world of gadgets and, even more, user interfaces.  I will try to substantiate my opinion. <br><br><h2>  There is no revolution. </h2><br>  One can argue for a long time whether Steve Jobs created a revolution, or only successfully combined already existing technologies.  This is not so important in the context of my thoughts - clearly, he managed to turn the entire mobile world.  Why?  In short, <br><ul><li>  Button interfaces are good for dialing, but not good for web surfing.  What are the attempts to get to the desired input field from the slider Samsung D-500. </li><li>  The author read about the light pen in a book about a cat BASIC and Professor Fortran.  But it is very inconvenient to do on weight. </li><li>  The interfaces of the mid-two thousand mobile phones were terribly complex.  Knowledge of how to change the ringtone, scooped on the forums.  The firmware was raw, and it never occurred to anyone to update them. </li><li>  after racing thirty games you still have a chance to play two and a half.  Compatibility issue. </li></ul><br>  You can find others, but at least four serious problems solved the iPhone.

    <h2>  What problems will Google Glass solve? </h2><br>  <i>The problem of "foreign gadget" in your pocket?</i>  This is ridiculous.  A mobile phone for a modern person is just as foreign as a wrist watch for an officer of the Soviet army.  But the glasses themselves look like Martian, forgive me my favorite mars rovers. <br><br>  <i>Bad interface problem?</i>  The man is a man, that from the very moment he climbed down from a tree, he picked up a stick.  He is accustomed to doing something with his fingers, he has been doing just that since childhood. <br><br>  The Google Glass interface ‚Äî the touchscreen on the eyeglass and nodding back and forth ‚Äî only evokes a sense of anal anxiety. <br><br>  <i>Has Google been a voice interface model for us?</i>  This idea is also a hundred years old at lunchtime, since Win98 and Dragon Dictate.  Play for an hour, and then click the mouse again and type.  Because it is more convenient and faster. <br>  Voice search in the form in which it is, can only serve to quickly enter text into the field.  Change focus, scrolling, throwing birds in pigs - how to do it is completely incomprehensible.  Without toys, any non-business platform is doomed to despondency and quick death. <br><br>  At least, several colleagues-owners of top smartphones told me today that they used voice input once.  Maybe two. <br><br>  <i>Maybe Google will build in your Kinect glasses and we will be able to move spherical horses with our hands</i> ?  But this again brings us back to the problem of the light pen! <br><br><h2>  Google is a company of engineers. </h2><br>  If you think about it, Google never invented anything new.  They did not do a search engine, they did it the best.  They were not the first to make a mobile OS, they made it open.  They know how to do better, on a large scale, but I don‚Äôt remember any real innovation from Google. <br><br><h2>  Unworthy marketing. </h2><br>  My acquaintance with google.com began in 2002 as a search engine for programmers made by programmers. <br><br>  My acquaintance with Google + began yesterday, when Google Play did not give me, without registering, leave a comment on the insane fly that we play with my wife in the evenings. <br>  Formally, they added another user - marketers will be able to actively ‚Äútrade in dead souls‚Äù by one googollion percent. <br>  It is still not clear for what, but the product is already ‚Äúthrust‚Äù very aggressively.  Bought, paid for today‚Äôs review of a journalist for a kilometer is confirmation of this.  Despite this, even Joshua doubts the potential of the product he advertises. <br><br><h2>  My prediction. </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/573/8be/7f5/5738be7f5c1535631baa628fc3a9a08d.jpg"><br><br>  The fate of this gadget is like that of the jetpack in the picture.  Futuristic, fashionable, stylish, took off - but absolutely unsuitable in real life.  I sincerely wish Google to return to their origins and do simple and good things - a good search engine, good mail and a good online office.  Do not close the good, necessary reader and do not bother with a bad social network.  In the end, it's time to finish a good, but brake and ever-hungry operating system. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/173345/">https://habr.com/ru/post/173345/</a></p>
