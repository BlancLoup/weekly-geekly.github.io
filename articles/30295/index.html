Since the concept is rather vague today, the list includes all the resources that meet a simple requirement: any types of files can be stored on the service. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  <strong>Yandex people</strong> <br>  <a href="http://narod.yandex.ru/">narod.yandex.ru</a> <br>  Probably from the domestic file repositories this is what is called the ‚Äúmost widely heard‚Äù. <br>  Many have heard about the charms, but for order: the total size is not limited, the maximum file size is 5 GB.  You can upload multiple files at once.  You can share a file through a link, you can protect it with a password for your favorites, you can insert it into blogs and forums.  All files are checked by antivirus (dr Web), without this they are not available for download. <br>  Files are stored for 90 days, but this period can be extended (a letter with a notification comes in), the period is extended automatically if someone has downloaded the file. <br>  If your provider supports the Yandex ‚Äúlocal network‚Äù program, the traffic goes as an internal network. <br>  A test file of 85 MB in size was downloaded for 55 seconds, downloaded for 46 seconds.

      <strong>IPLoad</strong> <br>  <a href="http://ipload.ru/">ipload.ru</a> <br>  As written - free file hosting. <br>  Free on it - 500 MB of space for files (the same is the maximum file size), the storage period is 30 days, and registration is not required.  Registered users can write comments to files and protect them with a password. <br>  In addition, there are VIP-users who can, for example, for 48 USD buy 25 GB per month.  VIP'am available FTP, no speed limits and other pleasant things.  For example, do not wait 30 seconds before downloading the file. <br>  What is interesting - the owners of the resource pay registered users for ... downloading their files.  So for 1000 downloads of your file you will be charged 10 USD.  It is a pity that you can spend this money only on paid services of the IPLoad itself. <br>  A separate download is for a photo, apparently, should somehow be particularly displayed.  And there seems to be the same thing for the video, but clicking on it you get on something like YouTube from IPLoad, although the last video was uploaded there in the fall of 2007. <br>  Download the 85 MB test file for some reason did not work, but smaller files (5-9 MB) were loaded very quickly.  But the download speed was around 5 Kb / s.  Did not wait, broke off. <br><br>  <strong>Qlocker</strong> <br>  <a href="http://qlocker.ru/">qlocker.ru</a> <br>  Difficult case.  Rather like something like YouTube for files.  Files are uploaded to folders, which are called ‚Äúlockers‚Äù here.  But ‚Äúlocker‚Äù is not only a folder, but also a page with files, there are minimal tools for its design.  At the same time, media files are immediately displayed in the players (video, music, photos), you can shove the whole thing into playlists and slide shows. <br>  The space for storing personal files is 500 MB, for public files it is not limited.  The flash downloader loads files up to 100 MB, and if there are restrictions on simultaneous download, I did not notice them.  Files are also added to the download queue during upload. <br>  For all uploaded files and "lockers" (except personal and for friends) there is a search and ratings on the main page.  You can throw links to files, import them into blogs, etc. <br>  Another interesting feature is the community.  Those.  You can organize a community to which any registered user can join (there are also closed ones), then you make a ‚Äúlocker‚Äù for it and any of the project users can collect any content in such a ‚Äúlocker‚Äù. <br>  Judging by the small number of users and frequent bugs, the project is still quite young.  But interesting - at least curiosity is gnawing: how to survive, how to earn and how to deal with legal problems. <br>  The test file of 85 MB in size was flooded with 15 (!) Seconds (apparently, I was alone on the site ÔÅä), though on the second attempt.  Downloaded 81 seconds. <br><br>  <strong>Nextmail</strong> <br>  <a href="http://nxt.ru/">nxt.ru</a> <br>  As the name suggests, file storage is not the main functionality here.  But, nevertheless, along with a mailbox, hosting with a third-level domain name and a place for storing files is offered for free. <br>  1 GB is allocated for all; there is FTP access to the file storage.  Through the web-based interface, you can upload files of only up to 50 MB. <br>  A test file of 85 MB in size was flooded for 87 seconds, downloaded for 51 seconds. <br>  In principle, more hosting for sites than for files, but a separate interface for working with files (like WC or NC) staked out a project in the review. <br>  On the main page there is a list of upcoming changes for ... June.  So, perhaps, the service is already experiencing a certain crisis, well, or maybe just everyone on vacation. <br><br>  <strong>Funnyyyy</strong> <br>  <a href="http://www.funnyyyy.ru/">www.funnyyyy.ru</a> <br>  The authors of this resource, no doubt, know how to think up such a name so that the domain is free.  According to the user agreement, the service is located in the Republic of Latvia, but is oriented towards Russian users, judging by the ru zone and the Russian language. <br>  In addition to the usual file storage, the service offers users something truly exclusive - the ability to trade their own files.  But it is available only to "advanced" users.  A sign of advancement is a monthly fee of 1 USD. <br>  Instead, ‚Äúadvanced‚Äù get 1GB of disk space (against 100 MB of regular users), a lower commission when withdrawing earned money, the ability to increase disk space (1GB / 1USD once a month).  Download size limit - 2 GB. <br>  The site has a referral structure, i.e.  even if you came from the side - you must choose a referral of the upper level, who will receive a part of the money you spent. <br><br>  <strong>Share UA 2.0</strong> <br>  <a href="http://shareua.com/">shareua.com</a> <br>  Well, yes, ‚Äúua‚Äù, well, yes, ‚Äúcom‚Äù.  But the citizens of Russia are the only ones who can make money on the hosting of their files along with the citizens of Ukraine.  For 1000 downloads - 1.5 USD, output via WM. <br>  5 GB per user, 90 days of storage, 2 GB per file, FTP, remote download.  Payments have unlimited disk space, file passwords, no restrictions on speed, multi-threaded downloads, in addition, they can make the link to their files available only from certain sites.  The cost of a paid account at the same time is very democratic - 2.61 USD. <br>  The test file of 85 MB in size was flooded for 221 seconds, downloaded for 748 seconds, and the captcha was introduced only five times, although it was difficult to make a mistake there (I am sure that I was not mistaken). <br>  By files there is a search, a tag cloud, a gallery of recently uploaded on the main page.  Images can be combined into albums, and you can upload several files directly to the photo album. <br><br>  <strong>Rapidshara (ru)</strong> <br>  <a href="http://rapidshare.ru/">rapidshare.ru</a> <br>  It would not be logical if there was no file storage at that address.  But everything is logical. <br>  The maximum size of the uploaded file is 1.5 GB (5 GB for VIP, 260 WMR per month).  File retention period is 35 days, can be extended, automatically extended when downloading.  For freebies - at the same time only one connection from one IP. <br>  For VIPs, there is a file search and download from other services.  Upload images can be used directly on their sites and blogs.  There is a client for downloading and working with downloaded files.  When downloading, you can convert the downloaded file into a password-protected archive. <br>  The test file with a size of 85 MB was flooded for 157 seconds, the download speed was 50-60 KB / s. <br><br>  <strong>Deposit files</strong> <br>  <a href="http://depositfiles.com/ru/">depositfiles.com/ru</a> <br>  Well, it is clear that not quite a Russian resource.  But it was transferred, tried - to the list!  Although it may be foreign mirrors - mirrors, but contact with the administration should be in English. <br>  On the main page it is stated that the maximum file size is not limited, although on other pages it is written that 4 GB.  Storage capacity is unlimited.  Shelf life - "while the file is claimed."  There is a client to download. <br>  There is a GOLD-account that removes ads, removes the limit on download speed and download timeout, downloading 250 files at once instead of one. <br>  The test file with a size of 85 MB was flooded with 269 seconds, the download speed was 45-55 KB / s. <br><br>  <strong>Webfile</strong> <br>  <a href="http://www.webfile.ru/">www.webfile.ru</a> <br>  The file is stored for 30 days, 150 MB - the maximum size (increased on July 2 of this year).  Users outside of the Russian Federation are limited in speed (apparently, by IP). <br>  By file search works, there are categories by subject, there is by file type. <br>  Registered users can make directories, see all their files, download statistics, their files are stored longer. <br><br>  <strong>iFolder</strong> <br>  <a href="http://ifolder.ru/">ifolder.ru</a> <br>  Files up to 100 MB, stored up to 30 days, can be extended after the letter with the notification.  There are FTP, work downloads, you can download in several streams.  Registered users can access the uploaded file management interface. <br>  For money, you can upload files up to 15 GB (6 USD), the extension of them is also paid. <br>  The 85 MB test file was flooded for 103 seconds, the file was downloaded in 29 seconds ... <br><br>  <strong>Meetfile</strong> <br>  <a href="http://www.meetfile.com/">www.meetfile.com</a> <br>  The title is ‚Äúfree file hosting‚Äù.  Physically everything is located in Kiev. <br>  The file limit is 100 MB, stored for 30 days.  For registered FTP is available. <br>  There is a file directory, besides categories by type, there is also a topic, though there are only two themes - ‚Äújokes‚Äù and ‚Äúauto‚Äù.  For photos and videos there is a preview, you can view and even without downloading, directly on the site.  Video can be downloaded in 3gp. <br>  A test file of 85 MB in size was flooded for 122 seconds, downloaded in 360 seconds. <br><br>  <strong>Dump</strong> <br>  <a href="http://dump.ru/">dump.ru</a> <br>  40 MB for anonymous users, 100 MB for registered, files are stored for 30 days since the last download.  Also registered can manage uploaded files and protect them with a password. <br>  You can upload up to 10 files at a time. <br>  There is a search for downloaded files and a directory for file types.  The downloaded file can be estimated (albeit before the download), thereby affecting its rating.  Users have a profile. <br>  A test file of 85 MB in size was downloaded for 44 seconds, downloaded in 24 seconds. <br><br>  <strong>Spbland</strong> <br>  <a href="http://www.up.spbland.ru/">www.up.spbland.ru</a> <br>  Appendix to the city portal of the same name.  A bunch of ads per square centimeter. <br>  The maximum file size is 100 MB, the shelf life is 120 (!) Days. <br>  There is an FTP download.  You can set a password for the file. <br>  The test file with a size of 85 MB was poured in 201 seconds, the download speed was 35-45 KB / s. <br><br>  <strong>Leaked-flooded</strong> <br>  <a href="http://zalil.ru/">zalil.ru</a> <br>  There is also a mirror slil.ru.  Wonders of minimalism, inspired see ya.ru.  There is a true test flash uploader, but it is no less minimal.  Which is probably not bad. <br>  The maximum file size is 50 MB, the storage period is a month. <br>  The test file with a size of 25 MB was flooded for 18 seconds, the average download speed was 1-10 KB / s. <br><br>  <strong>Up LiRu</strong> <br>  <a href="http://up.li.ru/">up.li.ru</a> <br>  From interesting - all stored files are accessible by their types, directly from the main page.  There is an archive of programs from the creators and a blog. <br>  Of the less interesting, the maximum size of the stored file is 32 MB, the storage period is one month. <br><br>  <strong>Datacode</strong> <br>  <a href="http://data.cod.ru/">data.cod.ru</a> <br>  A subsection of the large portal cod.ru, as I understand it, is an online digital distribution store. <br>  Unregistered - 30 MB per file for 3 days.  Registered - 100 MB for a week and the luxury of being able to delete your file ahead of time. <br>  A 25 MB test file was uploaded for 20 seconds, the file was downloaded in 6 seconds ... <br><br>  <strong>filekeeper</strong> <br>  <a href="http://filekeeper.org/ru/">filekeeper.org/ru</a> <br>  You can upload files up to 100 MB without registration, FTP is available, the total amount for registered ones is 10 GB, no retention period is specified, but according to the user <a href="http://geektimes.ru/users/artleg/" class="user_link">artleg</a> , at least a year. <br>  There is a section in which you can view the directories of downloaded files, different icons indicate different types of files. <br><br>  <strong>Up giga</strong> <br>  <a href="http://up.giga.su/">up.giga.su</a> <br>  150 MB per file, passwords, link via e-mail, 30 days retention period. <br><br>  Well, for those who of the above did not like anything: <br>  <a
