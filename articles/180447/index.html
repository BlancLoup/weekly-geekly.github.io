  <section class="page js-page"><h1>What should be a personal computer</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  In this article I will not talk about the processors of the new generation, nor about the technologies of the future.  I just want to touch on the topic of construction of computer devices. <br><br><h4>  Let me explain what I mean. </h4><br>  To date, the trend is aimed at combining all functions into one device.  The market is filled with laptops, tablets, smart TVs.  But I categorically disagree with this state of affairs and perceive the current situation as a transitional period to another computer model - the MVC model. <br><br>  If you are a programmer, then this concept should remind you of the model-view-controller application architecture.  It is about this model and will reflect in this article.

This is a hard drive, flash drive, cloud storage. </li><li>  Controller - is responsible for the tasks performed and connects all parts of the system into one.  This includes a set of programs and the necessary hardware for this: a processor, video card, etc. </li><li>  The interface ‚Äî or view ‚Äî is responsible for the input-output interface.  For example, monitor, keyboard. </li></ol><br><br>  Consider each part separately and find out how all three parts should be connected to this: <br><ul><li>  First of all it was convenient. </li><li>  Secondly, it saved from unnecessary costs. </li></ul><br><br><h4>  Model </h4><br>  If you are the owner of several devices, then you probably experienced discomfort from the fact that the data is in different places and you need to somehow synchronize this data. <br><br>  From here came the cloud data services.  But if you don‚Äôt want to trust anyone with your information, then an external drive (starting with a flash drive and ending with an external ssd / hdd drive) is a great solution. <br><br>  <b>Conclusion:</b> for convenience, the data should be stored in one place. <br><br><h4>  Controller </h4><br>  Now let's think about what tasks a computer device should perform. <br><br>  Understandably, everything should be done on a personal computer.  And to play games, and work, and on the Internet to climb, and connect any specific device, in general, everything. <br><br>  On the TV, of course must be displayed TV programs.  But it would be nice to go online, of course.  And if you could play games on it?  And in general, you can build a computer into the TV!  And thus, the line between the personal computer and the TV is gradually erased (in terms of the tasks performed). <br><br>  Laptops and tablets - in fact, perform the same tasks as personal computers.  If earlier tablets were used more for entertainment, now there is a need to complete tasks related to work, including office work. <br><br>  <b>Conclusion:</b> the difference in the tasks performed by different devices gradually decreases. <br><br><h4>  Interface </h4><br>  Buying a laptop instead of a personal computer, the buyer gets it all!  Monitor, computer, keyboard, speakers, and much more, all in one bottle.  But the main thing - he gets mobility.  With the release of tablets, users get even more mobility. <br><br>  And when the line is erased in the difference in the performance of tablets and laptops, the only differences will be mobility and interface. <br><br>  And the following arguments are proof: <br><br>  Personal computer has a user-friendly interface.  You can connect a keyboard, mouse, steering wheels, speakers, multiple monitors.  But he is practically not mobile. <br>  Smart TVs are also not mobile, but sharpened by the output interface: high-quality large screen, sound output.  Laptops are more mobile, but at the expense of the interface.  Less convenient keyboard and manipulator, smaller screen.  Yes, you can connect additional I / O devices, but this is at the expense of mobility.  The tablets are super mobile, but the screen is very small and the input device is specific. <br><br>  <b>Conclusion:</b> mobility and interface are the most significant differences between a personal computer, laptop, tablet and smart TV. <br><br>  And now: <br><br><h4>  The essence of the problem </h4><br>  In the meantime, as manufacturers try to combine all these parts into one device, I disagree with this approach and explain why. <br><br>  With the advent of flash drives, I try to store all the data in one place.  It is very convenient.  As the saying goes: "I carry everything with me."  And at home and at work and in the car: all the files are always with me.  Whenever possible I install programs on an external drive. <br><br>  But with the ‚ÄúController‚Äù part things are worse.  In almost all devices, the controller is inseparable from the interface.  And this, in my opinion, is terrible! <br><br>  At home I need a controller with a TV interface.  At work, I need the same controller with a personal computer interface.  In transport, I want the same controller with a tablet interface. <br><br>  <b>I do not want to install different operating systems and different programs on three devices.</b>  <b>I want to use familiar programs, games with different interfaces: at home on a large TV, at work on two monitors, in transport on a small touch screen.</b> <br><br>  <b>Conclusion: the</b> controller and the model should be unique, and the interface should change depending on the situation. <br><br>  And there are two obstacles on this path: <br>  Technical - the performance of compact devices does not yet meet the needs of all users. <br>  Ideological - it‚Äôs still profitable for manufacturers to sell more devices: with three different interfaces, they can sell three identical ‚Äúcontrollers‚Äù. <br><br><h4>  Solving the problem today </h4><br>  I have to say, I do not advertise Intel products, but this is my first "like-minded person".  It was Intel that turned to the development of this idea.  Now he is actively promoting his system NUC - Next Unit of Computing.  And this phrase as closely as possible coincides with my idea. <br><br>  A vivid example of this position was the rejection of the sound card and analog video connectors, because it relates to part of the interface.  Video and sound are now displayed only in digital (hdmi or usb).  At home, you can connect to a large TV with a home theater, at work just to the monitor.  The truth is that there are no portable monitors yet, so that it can be used while lying on a sofa or in transport. <br><br>  NUC does not contain anything superfluous, only the ‚Äúcontroller‚Äù and the main connectivity of other devices: USB, HDMI, Ethernet, WIFI + WIDI. <br><br>  NUC computers are pretty compact to carry around.  Now all the programs can be installed on one computer and use them at work and at home, while not carrying a monitor and keyboard with them. <br><br>  But these are only the first steps of such an approach, and there are a number of unrealized opportunities. <br><br>  There are not enough portable monitors that would perform only the function of input-output.  There is not enough battery built into the computer.  Then such a computer could be used in transport. <br><br>  Also, the WIDI technology is poorly supported. <br><br><h4>  My wishes </h4><br>  I hope other manufacturers will support Intel initiatives.  I would like the manufacturers not to embed as much as possible into their device, but focus on the essence of their product: the monitor - image output, the computer - the execution of tasks.  I hope Asus and others will stop making transformers from their devices, and they will agree among themselves and make two separate devices: a portable monitor and a separate computer.  And they will be connected in some standard way, for example, by usb, hdmi and widi. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/180447/">https://habr.com/ru/post/180447/</a></p>
