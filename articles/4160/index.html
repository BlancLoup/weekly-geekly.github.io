  <section class="page js-page"><h1>To the “Live Journal” attached “Live newspaper”</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The notorious <a href="http://www.livejournal.com/">Livejournal</a> (LiveJournal), more precisely, its Russian-speaking part, is gradually recruiting a retinue from related resources that would not have appeared at all if there were no “father”.  The recently revealed <a href="http://jags.ru/">“Live Newspaper”</a> is one of this “suite”; it is an aggregator of messages of Russian-speaking users of Live Journal.  The creation of this project was an attempt to bring to the greater clarity the most interesting and relevant that is in LJ. <br><br>  The resource is updated several times a day.  Its readers can recommend authors for the publication of their postings, and also offer new headings.  The project is in beta, so there are no serious statistics on it yet. <br><br>  Anton Nosik, editor-in-chief of <a href="http://www.mosnews.com/">MosNews.com</a> , <a href="http://www.gazeta.kg/">Gazeta.Kg</a> and simply a well-known Russian blogger, believes that the experiment of Sergey Moskalev, an ideologist of the Alive Newspaper, is interesting: "This service has a rather specific UTP, this is not Mamba and not even "LV +".  This is a newspaper stuck together from LJ, that is, a product at the intersection of interest in blog content and online media format.  How many readers will appreciate such a cocktail, I do not know. ”

      Anton Nosik answered the question of “Habrakhabr” on the feasibility of a third-party resource with the friendliness available for every LJ user filled with anyone's postings: “Frendlent - just like, say, news agencies - this is some informational raw material that is obviously unfiltered.  Personally, I do not read friendslating due to the low efficiency of employment.  If my friend had someone filtered for me, then I would start reading it.  At the same time, filtering is necessary both by topics, by genres, and by authors.  And ideally - flexibly for all these keys customizable.  Another question is what independent sorters will do when (and if) a search on blogs from Yandex will acquire this functionality. ” <br><br>  Sergey Parfenov, the creator of <a href="http://www.ljplus.ru/">LJplus</a> , sees in <a href="http://www.ljplus.ru/">Zhivaya</a> Gazeta a simple RSS collector who reads a certain number of magazines.  “I don’t think that behind the idea of ​​broadcasting records of thousands of employees there is some sensible business model,” says Sergey.  - Of course, there are many sites that are supported by robots.  Robot more robot less - what's the difference? " <br><br>  “Will this initiative be in demand?”  If the author’s presence is the selection of magazines for relaying, then I don’t think the project has a future, ”continues Sergey.  - Anyone can make a friend with the same magazines.  Or with others - to your own taste.  Such projects are interesting precisely because of their author's view on the understanding of the “interestingness” of this or that record.  There are, for example, <a href="http://www.stopper.ru/">Stopper.Ru</a> , which publishes recordings in the “manual selection” mode, there is <a href="http://www.musiclook.ru/">musiclook.ru</a> , there is a <a href="http://ljplus.ru/blog/">blog</a> on LJplus ”. <br><br>  To the question “do LJ users need to turn to a third-party resource, if each of them already has its own“ newspaper ”- friendlet,” Sergei replied that the habit plays a decisive role: “I went to the resource, I thought:“ Oh, cool ”- and began to walk every day.  In principle, this is how the permanent audience of any site is recruited.  But when you can get the same with great convenience and know how to do it - you will do it.  And when you do not know, you will not do it.  That is, this resource can be <br>  interesting to newcomers who came to LJ - to get acquainted with his "heroes".  But as soon as they figure out what and how, the project will become meaningless for them. ” <br><br>  “Only one thing pleases me in all of this: LJ goes beyond itself, the content of some diaries becomes interesting not only to the friends of their authors, but also finds readers outside LJ, as part of third-party projects, in offline editions, etc.  Therefore, any new resource of this kind draws attention to the blogosphere, and this, in general, plays into the hands of those who are trying to work in this area. ” </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/4160/">https://habr.com/ru/post/4160/</a></p>
