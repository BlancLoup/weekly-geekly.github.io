  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Ability to count</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  There is a colloquial verb ‚Äúto count‚Äù, which means - to simulate in your head various variants of the development of the event and the consequences.  Today I want to talk about the ability to calculate the moves, and why this is the most important skill in life. <br><br>  To start a small introduction.  Have you ever wondered why many great people love chess?  Why did Sergei Galitsky (a billionaire, build the network ‚ÄúMagnit‚Äù from scratch), speaking of things important for a businessman‚Äôs beginner, said first of all about logic (by the way, Sergey did good in chess at the time).  Why about the same logic says the famous blogger Fritz Morgen.  And the outstanding businessman Dmitry Potapenko, telling about how he managed to build his network of stores and restaurants, when modeling business processes, suggests using flowcharts of algorithms from the eighth grade? <br><br>  Because they are able to lay out the tasks in the head for several iterations, a few steps. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  This skill, along with a number of others, plays an invaluable role in my life. <br>  Its essence is that you immediately in your head, when you think about a task, immediately try to decompose it into several iterations (from two or more).  Very often, the principle of ‚Äúcan one not do it‚Äù helps, when the first iteration is specifically chosen as simple as possible, consisting only of what is necessary in order to go through it as quickly as possible and get real live information for further stages.

      Typical example.  There is a problem in the development of programs - you can simultaneously satisfy any two of the following three qualities: quickly, cheaply, efficiently. <br><br>  As a rule, if you do everything quickly, you get a product that cannot be developed and scaled later - you need to rewrite everything first.  And if you do it qualitatively, then the product is being made for so long that by the time of delivery it does not meet business conditions. <br><br>  Playfully solves this paradox approach, when a simple version of the product is first made, it is brought to the market as soon as possible, but considering that there will be a revision.  Feedback is received, the understanding of the task is improved, and then many subsequent versions are made.  Between versions, time is given for refactoring, bringing the code in order, improving the quality of the product. <br><br>  Also worth noting is the problem of change, which has buried the so-called waterfall management approaches for developing software products and has spawned agile methodologies based on iterations.  The bottom line is that the program can not be made good without trying on real data.  And you can try only after the development.  There is a certain paradox, therefore, often along the way, customers, rethinking the project, try to make changes before the project is completed.  What, as a rule, is impossible because of the powerful plan for a long time (waterfall, for example, RUP), under which all business development processes are sharpened.  As a response, Agile methodologies were born, which consist of an infinite loop of iterations, when a budget is fixed for a certain period (for example, a month) and what is to be done during this period is selected, and upon expiration the situation is studied and a plan for a new iteration is drawn up.  In essence, this is a phased development, with a revision of everything at each stage. <br><br>  I will try to summarize the approach and why it is so important.  First of all, the approach is aimed at effective problem solving.  Efficiency is the fastest possible approach to the goal with a minimum of resources. <br>  Why is this approach very effective? <br><br>  As a rule, the solution to any problem consists, if greatly simplified, of ‚Äútheory‚Äù and ‚Äúpractice‚Äù.  What does a normal problem solution look like to a person who fails?  Man builds a very powerful ‚Äútheory‚Äù in his head.  However, trying to immerse himself in the problem, he makes mistakes in the very process of thinking.  Simply put, his thinking process in his head contains mistakes and incorrect premises that will lead to failure.  A partial list can be found on <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A1%25D0%25BF%25D0%25B8%25D1%2581%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BA_%25D0%25BA%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B3%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D1%2582%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B2%25D0%25BD%25D1%258B%25D1%2585_%25D0%25B8%25D1%2581%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B6%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B9">Wikipedia</a> . <br><br>  It can be said that a person often has knowledge and facts, but does not have enough wisdom. <br><br>  The most typical are two misconceptions: the idea that you can immediately plan a large and complex system for solving a problem, and that this system can be effectively done in one approach. <br><br>  Let us consider the first error.  Regrettably, any movement in any direction begins only when it is known where to go. <br><ul><li>  Any information about whether you are moving correctly is achieved by the difference between "theory" and "practice." <br></li><li>  Further, the faster you try the ‚Äúpractice‚Äù, the faster you will receive information to refresh the ‚Äútheory‚Äù. <br></li><li>  The more times you repeat the process, the more coherent and close to the ‚Äúpractice‚Äù will be the ‚Äútheory‚Äù. <br></li><li>  The more times in a fixed period of time it is possible to repeat the process - the faster the level of ‚Äútheory‚Äù grows, and the solution of the problem and the final result are achieved. <br></li><li>  From the above, the conclusion follows: for the most effective movement to any task, the optimal tactics are as many real-life actions as possible with constant rethinking of the current state of affairs. <br></li></ul><br><br>  The second error is refuted by a counterexample.  So, aspiring to make at once a ‚Äúperfect‚Äù tasty product, immediately a cool site, a cool car, or where nanotechnologies come to astonishment from the following data.  It turns out that one team in the west was able to meet the budget and deadlines during the construction of the airport and solve a number of important problems during the construction process, using this principle.  First, they built a cheap model in natural size and let real people go there.  Studying how people live in living conditions, themselves being visitors to the airport, civil engineers anticipated many problems and got a lot of interesting ideas that ultimately made the construction extremely efficient, significantly increase the efficiency of airport staff and greatly reduce the waiting time queues for passengers. <br><br>  Even in simple life.  Take a person who wants to learn English.  He tries to immediately take up reading books or films, realizes how much he needs to work, and gives up the task.  The task seems intractable and big. <br><br>  At the same time, using the approach of one day, about which I wrote earlier, and this approach of iterations, this question can be solved. <br><br>  True, it requires a little more magic :) You just need to know that a person needs an easy entry for a successful start of a business.  That to work effectively every day you need either a very strong motivation (which is rare), or a habit developed (you can develop any habit).  That it takes a month to develop a habit.  For effective memorization, it is best to record and connect words with any visual image, forcing not one hemisphere of the brain to work, but both at once.  And so on - all this knowledge is acquired in the presence of that thing, which is called enthusiasm, and I call ‚Äúburning eyes‚Äù in the staff.  Somehow there will be a post about it and about the role of labor in a person‚Äôs life ... <br><br>  Knowing this, the first simple steps are taken that do not require much effort.  Write out and learn on the road every day 10 words.  Listening in the background audio recordings in English, somehow related to interesting or enjoyable things, such as jokes, sci-fi audiobooks or BBC radio broadcasts.  Watch once a week for the weekend your favorite movie in English without subtitles (all dialogs in the movie should be known, at least in the sense). <br><br>  As a result, the person focuses on English (see the post about focusing), develops a habit, and further training goes on.  And for the year masters the language. <br><br>  In this way, my acquaintance, while studying at the two higher educational institutions and working on free graphics, learned five languages ‚Äã‚Äãof different sound families on the road - including Spanish, Chinese, and French. <br><br>  In general, iterations rule. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/139529/">https://habr.com/ru/post/139529/</a></p>
