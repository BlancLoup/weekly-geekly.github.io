  <section class="page js-page"><h1>7 types of programmers / friday fun /</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Once upon a time computers were something from the category of ancient monsters, and programmers are mystical monks who tamed them.  Joke.  We love programmers because they can do anything.  But those who have somehow come into contact with representatives of the IT world know that this is not just a faceless mass, but a whole society in itself, with its own interesting and typical characters.  Today we will introduce you to seven typical programmers. <br>  Spoiler: one of them is called Edik. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/7a5/514/304/7a5514304d7b48f4a1468bcee61a1a2b.jpg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  <b>1. Tired programmer</b> </h4><h6>  He is tired.  Very tired.  From the constant need to learn new technologies.  From complex customers.  From inaccurate tasks and incomprehensible documentation.  From the constant comments that he is ‚Äúbehind‚Äù. And, worst of all, he is tired of his own constant attempts to change something, because well, nothing happens.  And he stopped trying.  Just limp.  Began to focus on personal life.  He no longer kodit day without a break, if for this there is no serious need.  He does not want to learn new languages.  He hopes that his company will thrive and grow simply because he does not want to look for a new job. </h6><br><h6>  <b>// How to recognize it:</b> <br>  Sighs loudly every time new technologies are mentioned in a conversation. <br>  Carries a whole book with him, which proves that the technologies he uses are better than others <br>  Very rarely shaves - after such depression beard does not grow </h6><br><br><h4>  <b>2. Programmer-moth</b> </h4><h6>  He's so fickle.  He loves new things, technology, languages, systems.  She just adores overcoming difficulties, correcting bugs, and coping with the lack of necessary documentation.  He flutters like a butterfly, from one task to another, analyzes, tests, kodit and quickly flies on. </h6><br><h6>  <b>// How to recognize it:</b> <br>  Often says the phrase "Yes, it's cool, I studied this topic a few months ago, but it is not as cool as this one" <br>  Or ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt wait for xyz to be released with its new framework for managing bitmaps using the 9-dimensional Gauss method.  That will be great! " <br>  You can not surprise him with any news.  Never. </h6>

    <h4>  <b>3. Blogger</b> </h4><h6>  It seems to you that he is a programmer, but in fact he is a blogger.  He writes a new article every day, mostly about what he has learned today, but sometimes he threatens analytics.  And he sends rays of hatred to everyone who does not like him. <br><br>  <b>// How to recognize it:</b> <br>  "I will definitely write a blog about it" <br>  If you ask him about a hobby, he will reply ‚ÄúI am running a blog.‚Äù <br>  T-shirt with a blog address </h6><br><br><h4>  <b>4. Lazy man</b> </h4><h6>  His name is Edik.  And he is just one of the most honest people on the planet.  He wrote a beautiful code, well-structured, understandable to one and all, absolutely and completely bug-free, which was just full of comments.  And here you are discussing programming with him (surprisingly, yes?), He says that he wrote all these comments only because he was too lazy to change the code later.  Instead of doing everything at once so that everything works and is one system, he will make a bunch of amendments - not to redo everything at once.  Not!  Only not this! <br>  The "lazy" programmer sees how the system works as a whole and tries to solve as many problems as possible, relying on his own experience so that later he does not have to go back to these tasks and redo everything.  Just do not try to ask him to do something manually.  Automation is his fad. <br>  The "lazy" programmer is always looking for ways to acquire new skills, learn languages, learn technologies, so he is able to solve many problems quickly.  Nevertheless, sometimes (more often than others) a lazy programmer tends to exaggerate the needs of the client. <br><br>  <b>// How to recognize it</b> <br>  He is terribly angry, throwing a keyboard at the person who asks him to fix someone's sucks written code <br>  Sits all the time and studies online courses <br>  Automates everything.  Even the process of eating </h6><br><br><h4>  <b>5. Sage</b> </h4><h6>  Since his youth, he gained experience and imbued with the spirit of programming, with mother's milk to him got a love for the code.  Just sit and listen, student.  It's time to take a breath and feel the experience. <br>  The sage is an expert in the programming world.  He has been doing this longer than you live on this mortal planet, so he can tell you such stories that you would not believe.  He is the dinosaur of the IT world.  Well, if this did not convince you - he knew what ‚Äúcode‚Äù was even before Microsoft appeared. <br>  There are two types of ‚Äúwise men‚Äù: some are subject to changes over time (read, they absorb knowledge and new technologies), while others are not.  Experience is great, but experience without the desire to professionally evolve means nothing.  The ‚Äúsage‚Äù who is willing to learn is an invaluable specialist. <br>  A conservative sage will not listen if you decide to point out his mistakes to him, but an innovative sage will be glad if you share your experience. <br><br>  <b>// How to recognize it:</b> <br>  <i>Conservative sage</i> <br>  ‚ÄúThe architecture of the PDP-10 is pure art‚Äù <br>  "I'm too old for this guy" <br>  ‚ÄúI will not use this idiotic IDE!  Me and vi are good. ‚Äù </h6><br>  <i>Sage Innovator</i> <br>  ‚ÄúUgh, they licked this concept from Smalltalk‚Äù <br>  "Have you not seen what they came up with yesterday?" <br>  ‚ÄúWow, this is so elegant!  Thanks for teaching. ‚Äù <br><br><br><h4>  <b>6. Anyone who comments on such articles.</b> </h4><h6>  Some people just like to comment.  They think their sense of humor should be noted.  Someone just raises his self-esteem.  Someone enjoys commenting on a comment or commenting on a comment under a comment.  Sometimes, when an extra line under an article acquires its own life, he begins to think that the article is the body, and he is the bacterium that parasitizes and allows the body to live. <br><br>  <b>// How to recognize it:</b> <br>  "What kind of nonsense?" <br>  Angrily and expressively knocking on the keyboard <br>  ‚ÄúI was inspired!  Spasibki, smack ". </h6><br><br><h4>  <b>7. Poet</b> </h4><h6>  Its code is elegant and perfectly compatible with the design of the site - what difference does it work or not?  He likes to spend languid and incredibly long meetings and spat on deadlines, he's an artist! <br><br>  <b>// How to recognize it:</b> <br>  ‚ÄúCan you understand the beauty of the code?‚Äù <br>  Constantly asks you to look at his code <br>  Pretends to be inspired and kodit in unexpected places. </h6><br><br>  <b>We also have material on what <a href="http://icanchoose.ru/blog/8-tipov-kolleg-i-ofisnyh-rabotnikov/">types of colleagues and office workers there are</a> .</b> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/296104/">https://habr.com/ru/post/296104/</a></p>
