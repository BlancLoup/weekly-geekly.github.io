At first glance it may seem that both smartphones have not changed much, however, upon closer inspection, the difference is quite significant.  In the near future, the tablet, the Z3 Tablet Compact, should also be on sale, but you can familiarize yourself with a double review of new smartphones now.  Forward! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/8fc/b4f/1ff/8fcb4f1ff5c14f7d978fec723c4ebaf4.JPG"><br><br><a name="habracut"></a>

      <b>Appearance and ergonomics</b> <br><br>  External changes were quite significant.  Z3 has a rounded metal frame with polycarbonate inserts at the corners - they are designed to soften the blow in the fall, to distribute the load and try to keep the screen intact.  The plugs are smaller and have got rounded corners; in addition, the not too elegant speaker holes on the bottom end have disappeared, and the speaker has moved to the front panel. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f01/b79/48d/f01b7948d94a466bba9dce4bbb41eeff.JPG"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/001/970/08d/00197008d27c4acc9a40326e99869199.JPG"><br><br>  The controls and slots remained in place, except that the SIM card slot now requires the installation of a Nano-SIM card - keep in mind and, if necessary, change the card in the cabin when buying.  The "Compact" is the same situation.  The single-value version Z3 participated in the testing, however, a model with two slots should also be on sale, and one LTE card is allowed - it can be installed in any slot. <br><br>  The case has become thinner by 1 mm and a bit smaller - by reducing the frames around the screen.  The device lays down more comfortably in the hand than the Z1 / Z2, and the reduction in weight, albeit a slight one, is still felt and this can also be safely written into pluses. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/89e/b1e/41c/89eb1e41cd744a20a530ffd84b06fd35.JPG"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/9b3/212/6da/9b32126dab7c46cda91402bef32d1520.JPG"><br><br>  If the Z1 Compact was criticized for its plastic back wall, then the new generation has no such problem and the back panel is made of tempered glass.  The translucent polycarbonate frame looks quite stylish, especially with a black case, besides - it copes well with the role of a ‚Äúbumper‚Äù that protects the phone when it falls.  The plugs have become larger and more reliable, but the buttons remained where they used to be, since they were well located.  The movement of the buttons is still short and clear, they do not dangle and are easily located blindly.  Well and the most interesting - with the same dimensions as the previous model, the screen (again, due to the reduction in the thickness of the frame) became larger and its diagonal is now 4.6 inches.  In the past, the factory film has sunk, now the glasses themselves do an excellent job with protection against scratches, and the finger slides on them perfectly, leaving no traces. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/3a2/38c/9a7/3a238c9a713b400ca2f72cbb1baa4d41.jpg"><br><br>  With regard to color design, the Z3 can be black, white, copper and silver-greenish, and the Z3 Compact comes in black, white, orange and mint-green versions. <br><br>  <b>Iron and performance</b> <br><br>  The quad-core Snapdragon 801AC was overclocked to 2.5 GHz, the RAM of the Z3 is 3 GB, and the Z3 Compact is 2. Despite a slight increase in performance, in practice it feels quite strong, this has merit and optimized firmware.  Both devices instantly go out of the blocking mode, there are absolutely no hints of delays and slowdowns when performing any operations.  Standard applications, such as, for example, the camera or Walkman, run in less than a second.  The most voracious games, such as Asphalt 8, work perfectly with maximum settings. <br><br>  The test results can be found below. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/9c1/ed0/607/9c1ed0607bdf46dabc3b01be4f3d9c43.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c8f/fae/253/c8ffae25398f46a6a9c574c50bb03fe6.jpg"><br><br>  <b>Display</b> <br><br>  Let's start with the fact that more.  The Z3 also has a 5.2-inch display with an IPS-matrix and a resolution of 1920x1080.  If a year ago, some complained about insufficient viewing angles and a small margin of brightness, then the Z3 certainly does not have such problems (as well as its compact counterpart).  The image practically does not fade even with the maximum possible tilt, and the brightness even has to be reduced a little.  Positive effect on image quality and the absence of an air gap - this makes a significant contribution to the fight against glare.  As far as saturation is concerned, in the extreme brightness mode, the colors become even too juicy and this may not please everyone, however, the color rendition can be customized to your liking, for which there are several color modes and a special utility for adjusting white balance. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a96/1dc/303/a961dc3034f24f47958c62eb67abcd61.jpg"><br><br>  The screen of the Z3 Compact, as we have said, increased to 4.6 inches, but the resolution remained the same - 1280x720, this led to a slight decrease in image density up to 319 ppi, however it is not possible to notice with the naked eye and the picture looks the same clear, detailed and saturated.  You can see the pixels only if you try very, very hard. <br><br>  Both displays support up to 10 simultaneous keystrokes, have a glove mode and perceive wet fingers correctly. <br><br>  <b>Sound</b> <br><br>  The sound engine and standard Walkman audio player have undergone some changes: the DSEE HX function appeared, which, as far as possible, restores the frequencies removed from the compressed files and significantly improves the sound quality of mp3, in addition, there are presets for various models of headphones and HiRes audio via USB.  The familiar function of many ClearAudio + allows you not to set the settings manually, and applies all the "enhancers" in a complex.  The maximum volume in the headphones has significantly increased, now you can not unscrew it to the full and do not use third-party tools to raise the limit.  The built-in speakers also became louder and even acquired some bass - in terms of sound, they can be compared with a small bluetooth speaker.  As for the conversational dynamics, here, as usual, there is a volume reserve of 20% and the interlocutor can be heard just fine. <br><br>  <b>Camera</b> <br><br>  The 20.7-megapixel camera has acquired a new level of sensitivity of ISO 12800, which allows you to take pictures in low light conditions and get high-quality images with low noise.  By default, the camera shoots in automatic mode with a resolution of 8 megapixels and this, in my opinion, is quite enough, moreover, compared to last year, the auto mode began to work extremely correctly and practically does not need manual settings, except in special cases.  In manual mode, you can adjust the exposure, white balance, set the resolution, sensitivity, metering mode and focus, and use the HDR mode. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/506/926/d80/506926d8061c44449f371185dd68b0fe.jpg"><br><br>  Additional features have appeared, such as Sound Photo (photo with sound), Multi-camera (shooting a single object from different angles using several Wi-Fi synchronized smartphones), simultaneous shooting of the front and main camera, video recording from the screen (screencast), slow motion video shooting, shooting in 4K resolution, as well as new effects of augmented reality - now you can not only launch dinosaurs into the room, but also draw various three-dimensional figures in the air or throw bombs out of the window. <br><br>  In camera mode, you can use third-party downloadable applications, such as Timelapse for accelerated shooting of sunsets and sunrises, or Vine for recording short videos and sending them to Twitter.  To launch them quickly, you do not need to turn off the camera and look for the corresponding icon in the list of applications; just switch the shooting mode. <br><br>  Below you can see the photos taken by the camera Z3 and Z3 Compact.  The shooting was carried out in automatic mode. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/7d8/3f9/0da/7d83f90dacac43c9970a51c88b55c562.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/db2/10e/939/db210e939056411db5ee4abfad16f1cc.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/dd3/0a9/801/dd30a980112a402ea4b0ff45b8538a9b.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/574/74c/f9e/57474cf9e7c94fd1a7ab2c984a45637f.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/bdd/09e/ef2/bdd09eef27954bf0b8eedb1f2274cc75.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/5af/28f/e48/5af28fe486de41baaf6b18403d049b34.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/df3/be4/998/df3be49984024722a3868b6b9f78a7d5.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/91d/83b/86a/91d83b86a5f34517a16ad676a6414f38.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d55/ac0/c92/d55ac0c928e546118e722b55ed61eeac.jpg"><br><br>  <b>Soft</b> <br><br>  Both smartphones have onboard Android 4.4.4 with a proprietary shell, which has changed somewhat in appearance and has become noticeably smoother to work.  The clock design on the lock screen has changed, and the parallax effects when scrolling through the screens have become a bit more beautiful.  If you do not like the new design, then you can switch to a more familiar one or download one of the themes offered by the Xperia Themes project, and their benefit is increasing every day. <br><br>  A set of pre-installed applications has been added to the Deezer music service (which is now integrated into the Walkman), the Lifelog application (we described it in detail in the SmartBand review), the Live on YouTube live broadcast system, and the AVG antivirus.  Nowhere are your usual Evernote, OfficeSuite, TrackID, Socialife and File Commander.  If necessary, these applications can be safely removed. <br><br>  Z3, Z3 Compact and Z3 Tablet Compact were able to broadcast the image from the PlayStation 4. The device can be attached to the DualShock4 gamepad (an optional GCM10 accessory is required) and broadcast the image to it.  The tablet can play the role of the main screen or be optional, too, if the game has a corresponding function.  So, for example, you can watch the news on TV without interrupting the game, which will be transferred to the tablet. <br><br>  <b>Protection</b> <br><br>  The protection class of both models increased to IP68, which means complete protection against dust and performance when immersed in water to a depth of one meter for no more than 30 minutes.  The main thing is to check the tightness of the plugs before bathing.  The reliability of the plugs does not cause any doubts, however, in order to avoid deformation, it is still better not to open them once again and use the docking station for charging. <br><br>  Of course, the screens can not correctly respond to pressing under water, but to the rescue, as always, comes the hardware button to start the camera.  As for strength, but we did not dare to take a serious crash test, but both vehicles endure falls from a low height well - polycarbonate shock absorbers do save glass from damage. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/859/a65/e0d/859a65e0dbd7436abcf99ee643b37740.jpg"><br><br>  <b>Autonomy</b> <br><br>  The battery capacity of the Z3 decreased from 3200 to 3100 mAh, however, this had no effect on the autonomy, moreover - the Z3 and Z3 Compact, according to phonearena.com, became the most "long-playing" <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/237721/">of the flagship smartphones</a> .  For example, Z3 can continuously work for about nine and a half hours with maximum load, and in normal use one charge lasts two days.  ‚ÄúCompact‚Äù, due to the small screen, consumes less energy and it is enough for it to have a 2600 mAh battery, which, nevertheless, allows it to work even longer than the Z3.  Do not forget about the STAMINA mode, which, if necessary, can extend the life from one charge to almost a week. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/25b/2da/3be/25b2da3be8e04bc3ad58c1422da396b4.jpg"><br><br>  <b>Summary</b> <br><br>  If the improvements to the ‚Äúbig‚Äù Z3 can be called, in general, cosmetic, since there was nothing much to improve, but in the case of ‚ÄúCompact‚Äù a very serious and large-scale work was carried out, about the same as in the case of Z1 and Z2.  Personally, I think such a format of smartphones is ideal and I always prefer 4-inch models to ‚Äúshovels‚Äù and, if I had some complaints about the Z1 Compact, then the new model seemed to me just great and I didn‚Äôt find any noticeable flaws in it I will use myself. <br><br>  <b>Features Xperia Z3</b> : <br><br>  <b>Processor</b> : 4-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 801, 2.5 GHz <br>  <b>Memory</b> : 3 GB RAM, 16 GB internal, SD card slot <br>  <b>Video accelerator</b> : Adreno 330 <br>  <b>Display</b> : 5.2 inches, IPS, 1920x1080 <br>  <b>Camera</b> : Exmor RS 1 / 2.3 ", 20.7 megapixel <br>  <b>Battery</b> : 3100 mAh <br>  <b>OS</b> : Android 4.4.4 KitKat <br>  <b>Protection</b> : IP68 <br>  <b>Dimensions</b> : 146 x 72 x 7.3 mm <br><br>  <b>Features Xperia Z3 Compact:</b> <br><br>  <b>Processor</b> : 4-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 801, 2.5 GHz <br>  <b>Memory</b> : 2 GB RAM, 16 GB internal, SD card slot <br>  <b>Video accelerator</b> : Adreno 330 <br>  <b>Display</b> : 4.6 inches, IPS, 1280x720 <br>  <b>Camera</b> : Exmor RS 1 / 2.3 ", 20.7 megapixel <br>  <b>Battery</b> : 2600 mAh <br>  <b>OS</b> : Android 4.4.4 KitKat <br>  <b>Protection</b> : IP68 <br>  <b>Dimensions</b> : 127.3 x 64.9 x 8.6 mm </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/239955/">https://habr.com/ru/post/239955/</a></p>
