My head is spinning from work and from the dynamics of the growth of the project.  The day before yesterday, we made a large-scale launch of the project and received 500 registrations at once. <br><br>  Plus, the virial effect has begun, and registrations have already come from shared posts and affiliate programs. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Let's take it in order.  In fact, we did not start yesterday, but two weeks ago.  We looked at the callback services market and also wanted to ‚Äúcut the money‚Äù quickly.  Made an offer in the market and put the cost of one conversation with a customer 50 rubles.

      Started making cold calls, hooked up 17 customers.  Received one payment for 900 rubles.  So we lived for two weeks and it became clear that something had to be changed. <br><br>  They put themselves in the client's place and thought: in fact, a callback is an ordinary telecom service.  Of course, there is a service in the form of a widget, in the form of technical support, but this is not a reason to take money from people for each call or for each minute of conversation. <br><br>  So, the starting point has cleared up.  There are two components in the callback service: telecom (telephone connection with the client) and service (the widget itself, the button to the site, technical support, user training, call recording).  And we decided to completely change the model.  Give users the opportunity to use the service for free in the basic version and, if desired, purchase a paid version with additional functionality. <br><br>  We immediately added tools to the service to create a viral effect.  These are bonuses for the fact that a person talks about the service to friends (they are spoken about in the interface itself and in the letters of transactional mailing), as well as an affiliate program with interesting conditions, which allows you to start a ‚Äúautomatic growth‚Äù of the client base without a certain number of sites. partner participation. <br><br>  We started processing the service this Saturday (August 1, 2015), sat down, picked up tea, coffee, put on a hookah and started developing.  All the functionality was ready, we only have to do per minute billing.  No sooner said than done.  On Sunday evening, with red eyes and a square head from hookah smoke, the service was ready.  But the most difficult thing is to give information on the landing page why we are free.  Long sat and "puffed" over it.  So really not deciding anything went home. <br><br>  In the morning - they finished off the landing by adding a little by adding peppercorns, who knows he will understand: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f09/fbf/85d/f09fbf85d12e44ca8a4ebd458cbcb877.jpg"><br><br>  The day before yesterday, Monday (08/03/2015) we decided to make a launch and the first thing we did was send a message to people we know.  Who are these: I occasionally spend free events and workshops.  When registering for them, we collect mail.

Service explanatory, I really liked.  Previously, I used only GetResponse. <br><br>  And away we go.
