I invested in five projects, and I hope to invest in five more.  Only in the USA and Europe, the video market is estimated at 500 billion dollars.  TV, movies, video games, virtual reality, augmented reality and even the Internet will soon merge into a single space. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/dfa/1b2/445/dfa1b2445121bba4a491cf724fbce044.jpg" alt="image"><br><a name="habracut"></a>

      In western countries, television is watched for 5 hours a day.  Why?  Because it is better to see once.  We still have a hunter and a collector living in us who explains the phenomena of nature to fellow tribesmen sitting by the fire. <br>  Picture.  Sound.  Motion.  Equals movement. <br><br>  Emotion = memory.  Remembrance + positive feelings = energy to consume or act. <br>  That is why I talk so often <a href="http://www.bothsidesofthetable.com/2011/05/17/the-importance-of-the-narrative/">about the power of the word</a> .  All stories are our everything.  And the best way of narration is pictures.  That's why I have an online video show. <br><br>  And the best way to talk about your startup is also through video.  Within 30-90 seconds, you can convey your thoughts using pictures, words, music, statistics and jokes.  Remember the company with the most competent marketing policy?  I'm sure almost everyone thought about Apple.  Now, remember how Apple ingeniously conveys emotions and product features through video clips.  When videos became more popular, a startup Epipheo appeared, offering video storytelling services.  They made funny videos where they mixed technical terms and jokes. <br><br>  The problem is that soon they became so popular, and their videos became so stereotyped that they could be identified without a logo.  They were all about: <br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/xKa8Zcx1kX4%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=25657,15700021,15700186,15700190,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhh_2m4-mcgNpA4F0gJkrk9JoGwiAQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  Charming and affordable.  But after watching 5 of these videos, you can not see them.  I do not in any way criticize this wonderful company that turned the world of online video upside down, but they need to redo their format a bit. <br><br>  Epipheo‚Äôs successor is <a href="http://sandwichvideo.com/">Sandwich Video</a> , which now leads the segment and is the most sought-after startup video player.  Here is an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3D0upQlA6K5YI">amazing video</a> about our portfolio company Osmo, which gained 200,000 views.  Tooth give that Osmo happy with this video. <br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/0upQlA6K5YI%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=25657,15700021,15700186,15700190,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhilxPUxA_PfOGQ8dLPVO4H3_YEfzw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  We often recommend Sandwich to startups, as they have already done some cool projects for our companies.  But in many ways, I think, the video story market will continue to evolve.  In Los Angeles and New York, there are many excellent video producers who every day hone their skills and just wait to be opened.  Young and promising teams can create a more budget, but, nevertheless, very memorable video. <br><br>  Mega - creative vice president of the company MakeSpace on brand development <a href="https://twitter.com/rionharmon">Rion Harmon</a> created a series of videos describing their <a href="https://vimeo.com/128375625">data warehousing start-up</a> .  See for yourself and share your impressions with me.  For me, the videos are very trendy - funny, catchy and modern. <br><br>  I think in the future, videos about startups will be made exactly like this, and not modeled on outdated, slightly bored clips in the V1 format, which appeared a long time ago. <br><br>  1. <a href="https://vimeo.com/128375625">Jump the Gun</a> <br>  2. <a href="https://vimeo.com/127490509">Empty Nest</a> <br><br>  If you are interested in how these videos were shot, you can follow the link to read the <a href="http://www.fastcocreate.com/3046396/the-creators-of-pot-dealer-web-series-high-maintenance-deliver-for-makespace">background from Rion</a> . <br>  And not to be unfounded, we are also very actively making a video about what we are doing in Upfront Ventures.  Here is a short video about the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DlXQMKqEfnDU">upfront summit 2015</a> . <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/lXQMKqEfnDU%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=25657,15700021,15700186,15700190,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhgnK2AsxE4Nu8JF0FES4jIimm4oDA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  Last year we made a video about some of our <a href="https://vimeo.com/87564962">portfolio companies</a> . <br><br>  In general, I think you yourself will notice that more and more companies are using videos to declare themselves.  I do not see them as a simple B2C (business client) marketing tool.  Just as custom Internet products have motivated the creation of well-designed corporate products, so budget videos on the Internet will affect the reconstruction of the communication matrix of companies among themselves. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/912/aff/82b/912aff82b73b0dc99f20aa5d55774a9e.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Mark Saster is an Upfront Ventures partner.
