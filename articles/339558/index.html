Vlad spent a lot of time reading books on the history of design as a profession and a cultural phenomenon.  This in itself is fascinating, and in relation to its industry, it also helps to get rid of many cliches and cargo cults, which arise due to professional mythology.  I managed to read only Adriana Forti and a couple of books on the subject, so thanks to the Design Culture, you can cut off a few corners and cover a lot more. <br><br>  In the second edition, the focus shifted from history to how the design culture influences the relationship between the designer and the customer.  Although the terms are slightly confusing, the very idea of ‚Äã‚Äãisolating the worldview (knowing what is good) and methods / practices / habits (don't forget to do well).  The theme of the formation of design culture in companies is one of the most relevant in recent years and Vlad has an interesting approach from the theoretical side. <br><br>  In general, if you did not read the first edition, then you missed a lot and the new version of the book will greatly broaden your horizons.  If read - the second edition adds a point of practical application of these ideas. <br><br><br>  <strong><a href="https://medium.freecodecamp.org/everyone-hates-a-redesign-or-do-they-b8a2fec9efbe">Haters gonna hate - What we can learn from Facebook's 2006 news feed redesign</a></strong> <strong><a href="https://medium.freecodecamp.org/everyone-hates-a-redesign-or-do-they-b8a2fec9efbe"><br></a></strong>  Mike Frederick Ziethlow recalls the epoch-making launch of the Facebook news feed in 2006, which by external attributes looked like a complete failure - 700 thousand users signed a petition against, about 5% of the audience at that time.  But the company understood what it was doing and saw the metrics, so it waited for a wave of negativity, and the insane growth of the user base and profit suggests that it was right.  Although it is important to understand that the key here is not suicidal obstinacy, but an understanding of why a redesign is being done and how to understand its effectiveness. <br><br><h2>  Trends </h2><br>  <strong><a href="http://brandmark.io/">Brandmark</a></strong> <strong><a href="http://brandmark.io/"><br></a></strong>  The enthusiast of algorithmic design Jack Qiao launched the Brandmark service for complex design work for small businesses.
