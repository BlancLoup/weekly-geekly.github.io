I attended a variety of events and lectures, participated in presentations and seminars, talked with entrepreneurs at trade shows, trying to understand the key ideas that help successfully bring projects to the market. <br><br>  I had to listen to the thoughts of entrepreneurs who had already gone this way, but, like many, I missed, having decided to learn from my mistakes.  It took me a lot of time, although it could shorten the educational period by half.

      Before launching a new project or before implementing improvements to existing ones, I ask myself three questions in the morning and in the evening for three days in order to think more deeply about the actions. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b>The first one: ‚ÄúDo I not do garbage?‚Äù</b> <br><br>  This question more than any other helps to realize the whole "genius" of the idea.  Perhaps you are doing something that is absolutely not necessary for people, although it can be applied everywhere.  Like, for example, a bicycle made from organic materials.  Yes, organic matter is now in trend, yes, it is an eco-friendly material that, after utilization, leaves no waste, or what other advantages, decide for yourself.  But is he needed?  Will you buy enough of it to ensure your profit? <br><br>  Perhaps this is not the best example, but the essence can be understood. <br><br>  <b>Second: "Is it just me who likes it?"</b> <br><br>  Here it comes to a variety of features and updates on the site.  How often, do we have the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãany option that should blow up the Internet and attract millions of users?  In fact, it turns out that she, by and large, does not need anyone. <br><br>  That is why, having invented the next ‚Äúchip‚Äù or peeping at the option on another startup, you need not to recklessly introduce it into your business, but to conduct tests and polls on it.  And if in a few days you are still sure that this function can help the project to develop, then feel free to implement it, having previously adapted it to your business model. <br><br>  <b>Third: "Will they pay for it?"</b> <br><br>  This is the most difficult and at the same time obvious question for every entrepreneur. <br><br>  When starting a project, you should clearly understand how to make a full-fledged business from a startup.  For all the time working with entrepreneurs, I have met a huge number of enthusiastic people who have not been able to go "beyond the startup."  Yes, they had interesting services, yes, they had regular users, but as soon as they decided to take payment for something, the customers left irrevocably. <br><br>  At the initial stage, you need to create a project value for the user, something that solves one of his problems. <br>  Do not be afraid to look for new, not used before, monetization methods.  From experience, I can say that almost any project can be made paid in three or four different ways, and allow your users to decide for themselves what it is more convenient for them to pay. <br><br>  There are other questions that a startup should ask itself regularly, which I propose to share in the comments.  If you have your own "guides", we will be happy to hear and try to use when working. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/290552/">https://habr.com/ru/post/290552/</a></p>
