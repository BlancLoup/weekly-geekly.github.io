    <a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h5>  operating system </h5><br><br>  In advertising texts about Windows 7, attention was paid to the work with touch screens.  True, it did not say that their full support is only in Windows 7 Home Premium (and higher).  If you try to put Starter or Home Basic on a tablet, you will be left without multitouch and handwriting recognition.  Therefore, on Odeon'e (as well as Iros'e and Viewpad'e) it is Home Premium. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/1899d5b5/ce23f538/6a7f405f/ff137312.jpg"><br><br>  The dimensions of the controls are sufficient for hitting them with your finger.  70 percent :), misses do happen.  But in general, you can use - click, double-click worked out normally.  Right click - either hold your finger for a couple of seconds, or touch the screen with two fingers.  Changing the scale of mixing / breeding fingers - not everywhere, but there is. <br><br><h5>  Reading texts </h5><br>  As I have written more than once, the tablet was bought, first of all, for reading djvu, pdf, cbr / cbz.  Formats, in general, are related - for the most part they are scans of books / magazines in various containers.  Therefore, it was logical to look for one program for viewing.  The first (and last :)) candidate was <a href="http://www.stdutility.com/stduviewer.html">STDU Viewer</a> .  Normally, it opens all the above formats, remembers the place where it stopped, there is support for touchscreens in the form of binding actions (page turning) to zones on the screen - as in the PDA and communicator readers, changing the size by mixing / spreading fingers. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/4a378d76/423fe354/8600f810/2cc849a4.jpg"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/49d1b1aa/a122fb2b/a0d55735/1217569a.jpg"><br><br>  Additionally displays fb2, but this is so, a nice bonus.  I do not read fb2 on the tablet (for this there is a communicator or, if it hurts, an electronic book).  If I read, I would put alreader. <br><br><h5>  Typing </h5><br>  Native virtual keyboard.  I tried several alternative options, but they are incomparable to the standard in terms of stability. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/e3593d45/9be8a3f7/4a60c299/5aa9b223.jpg"><br><br>  Handwriting is quite decent, but it is inconvenient to write with a finger, but there are no sensible styluses.  I bought myself a <a href="http://shop.brando.com/dagi-transparent-capacitive-touch-panel-stylus_p04019c0197d031.html">DAGi Transparent Capacitive Touch Panel Stylus</a> with a transparent ‚Äútip‚Äù - at least at least you can see where you poke it.  But the main problem with styli for capacitive screens - a large touch area - has not disappeared anywhere.  Because I use quite rarely, jot out some scheme in One Note. <br><br><h5>  the Internet </h5><br>  Firefox 4 (currently RC2).  Much faster than 3.x, there is finger scrolling, zooming in the text by mixing / diluting fingers.  Adblock and flashblock - to speed up the work, especially the second.  From small tvikov - vertical toolbar, visible and in full screen mode.  In theory, it would be necessary to bring more buttons on it to switch between tabs, but so far the hands do not reach. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/c37f9b3e/e6658e16/34b0f255/8bc8777c.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/82aa3ddf/fc0e2f81/22dfdf48/44cc2776.jpg"><br><br><h5>  Office </h5><br>  It is worth 2007 office (well, I had an additional license, and so it would only cost the watchers), it works fine.  I do not type texts, but it is quite possible to look at the ‚Äúprice list‚Äù without a keyboard. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/39d3509c/0940e0b8/f0918d8c/c94738bc.jpg"><br><br><h5>  View images </h5><br>  Photoframe, yes.  :) <br>  The card reader, however, is only for microSD, and in cameras I still have the usual SD.  It is necessary to cling through an external card reader. <br>  Watchman - <a href="http://www.4neurons.com/other/FPV/">Full Screen Viewer</a> .  The minimum functionality is only viewing, large forward / back buttons.  More can not do anything. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/0ffb068e/ddf6b191/e4023e46/736cccbd.jpg"><br><br><h5>  Video, music </h5><br>  I don‚Äôt listen to music at all, I watch videos occasionally.  It is enough Media Player Classic. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/b75f605c/acda4cb8/29cdde84/df8c009f.jpg"><br><br><h5>  Communication </h5><br>  I have not tried it - I have a phone to communicate with in my voice, and ICQ on the tablet is somehow not in demand.  But there shouldn't be any special difficulties - the webcam and microphone work, there are no problems with launching software for x86, so Skype and icq, and other gadgets should work without problems. <br><br><h5>  Additionally </h5><br>  It is worth Evernote, worth DoubleGIS. <br>  There are no problems with the first, in the second there is a bit too much advertising for such a small screen. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/681e51da/832703dc/e426c13f/8e313020.jpg"><br><br><h5>  findings </h5><br>  As I have said more than once, I bought a tablet as a ‚Äúbedside e-book‚Äù for certain file formats.  In this capacity, he completely suits me.  Who wants more from a tablet - you need to thoroughly think about what exactly this device wants and is capable of providing you with it or not. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/112625/">https://habr.com/ru/post/112625/</a></p>
