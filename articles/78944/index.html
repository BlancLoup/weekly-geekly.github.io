      I‚Äôm grateful to <b>Google</b> , <b>Microsoft</b> , <b>Apple</b> and the list below for what they do for their users, consumers and fans.  They are great.  I am grateful to them for what I do not do, for a number of reasons, although it is beneficial for them, but they do it. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Yes, <b>Google</b> earns $ 6 billion a year and has $ 2 billion in net profit, and spends only $ 20 million. Unfairly.  Yes, you think with your head.  It is just a gift.  Believe me, they spend a lot more money on charity.  It's just that nobody advertises.  What for?  I cannot say with a 100% guarantee that this is the case, you will say.  I don‚Äôt work at <b>Google</b> and I‚Äôm not sitting in a director‚Äôs chair, but the chance is that it‚Äôs equal to 99%.  Do you know why?  Because they have taken this and they have it profitable.  The more you spend in the west on charity, the less taxes you pay in the end. <br><br>  That's why Melinda and William, whom you praise so much, spend huge sums on charity.  And then, you have no idea how much they spend, because  you only know the numbers that their fund spends.  And the Melinda and Bill Gates Foundation is not only their money. <br><br>  So what I am all about?  And the fact that neither <b>Microsoft</b> , nor <b>Apple</b> , nor <b>Google</b> , nor substitute the name of the corporation that you hated deserve to wear the ‚Äú <b>Corporation of Evil</b> ‚Äù for several reasons: <br><br><ol><li>  First, they do something for you.  Whatever products you use, one way or another you use the products of these companies.  Many people use it, but shouts - EVIL.  This is called hypocrisy. </li><li>  Secondly, these same companies do a lot for you just like that.  They invest money in the development, which you then use, and they do not charge you a penny for it.  It is profitable for them, but it makes you feel good. </li></ol><br>  And the list of reasons does not end there. <br><br>  See how many <b>Google</b> , <b>Microsoft,</b> or <b>Apple products</b> do you use?  And now look, for what of this you pay? <br><br>  With your statements, you only show how jaundiced you are.  You envy, you want the same, but you can not.  Or do you want everything to appear at once?  It would be better instead of watering everyone with mud and showing his naked envy would go and try to do something even remotely resembling what the people who created these Corporations achieved, or go donate at least 100 rubles. <br><br>  Heavy?  This is it.  It is not so easy to give the earned money to anyone.  It‚Äôs not so easy to create such a powerful business. <br><br>  I want to say that enough is enough to consider other people's money, enough to build oneself from the great, not being such.  Become great, prove yourself first and foremost that you are great, and if you do not want this, then stop trying to lower those who wanted and became great. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/78944/">https://habr.com/ru/post/78944/</a></p>
