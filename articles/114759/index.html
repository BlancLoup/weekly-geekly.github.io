The original is spread over several pages of the <a href="http://forum.searchengines.ru/showthread.php%3Ft%3D600882">forum searchengines.ru</a> .  In order not to waste time flipping through the forum, I gathered all the messages of the author into a single whole. <br><br><h5>  Chapter one.  Optimistic. </h5><br>  Ambition was tormenting us, of course, from the basement-garage internet merchants, we really wanted to become the official dealer of all the major manufacturers of home appliances.  We conducted negotiations with representative offices, probed the ground. <br><br>  We collected information about other local dealers, sketched a simple business plan.  It turned out that a normal Belarusian dealer has a turnover of 30-50 million USD per year.  For such a business, it is necessary, respectively, working capital (own or borrowed) in the amount of at least 3-5 million USD. <br><a name="habracut"></a>

      We do not have so much.  Long tormented Excel and calculator, counting the possible options.  It was calculated that a dealer of European manufacturers could survive with 250 thousand dollars in circulation (it‚Äôs ridiculous for LG or Samsung to poke such money, they will not work with a millionaire with everyone).  But we didn‚Äôt have this money (a quarter of a million) either.  Our initial investor did not particularly want to go to the dealership. <br><br>  While this was going on, guys from the petrochemical business came out through friends through us.  They began to push aside from the supply of raw materials, and they are preoccupied with creating something new.  And their thoughts went in the same direction as ours - the creation of a dealer company for household appliances. <br><br>  Met, talked.  It seems to have found a common language.  They provide working capital, conduct all foreign economic activity, certification, etc.  We are sales, warehousing, delivery to customers, after-sales service and relationships with end users. <br><br>  Not fully resolved the question of how to share the markup.  We have previously agreed that we will be given a discount price so that we can earn something, if only at the expense of a large turnover.  And we will not take the same headings from other dealers, we will make every effort to ensure sales to our new partner. <br><br>  Damn, if we knew what awaits us ... <br><br><h5>  Chapter Two  Sad and comic. </h5><br>  At first, the newly minted dealer thoroughly kicked customs. <br><br>  During the import of goods from the company, they suddenly requested a bunch of completely incomprehensible and unexpected documents, explanations and certificates with the seals of our foreign partners.  Western companies have not responded to our request. If you do not prepare the documents, then at least stamp the papers prepared by us. <br><br>  In general, the impression was created that they decided that we were a little out of our mind: who in the world should prove that Electrolux really exists and really produces refrigerators?  And really sells at the price specified in the invoice?  And how does this fact prove a piece of paper with a blue print that can be easily forged through photoshop? <br><br>  VAT and duties for us suddenly increased by 2 times.  VAT rate on imported goods 18% of its price?  And customs believes that we have almost halved the price.  And for a fridge worth 500 euros, we have to pay not 90 euros of tax, but all 180-200 euros.  And other fees and charges are counted in the same way. <br><br>  In response, the petrochemists began to deliver the goods not directly from the factories, but through their firms in the Baltic States - they easily wrote us any certificate with any number of stamps.  The severity of problems with customs was reduced through several trials.  We are not taken to double taxes, but only 1.2-1.3 times more. <br><br>  But the most unpleasant surprise was presented by our petrochemical partners. <br><br>  They decided to conduct the whole business themselves, without consulting with us: purchases, pricing and assortment.  It was a silent horror! <br><br>  - instead of the ordered goods, we suddenly got a truck of something completely unnecessary: ‚Äã‚ÄãChinese vacuum cleaners instead of Italian refrigerators;  instead of narrow washing machines 60x45x85 cm, we received huge - 60x60x85 cm, which simply do not fit in the door of the average bathroom. <br><br>  We began to find out why petrochemists are bringing us this goods.  Answer: ‚ÄúThey gave us a good discount at the representative office and said it was very profitable.‚Äù <br><br>  - a significant part of the goods, 10-15%, was broken or badly damaged during loading and unloading at the Baltic and Belarusian warehouses.  The damage almost exceeded the expected returns.  The guys did not think that household appliances are not oil.  She should be able to load, only permanent, sober and adequate movers should be used, and not random drunks.  Ideally, we need modern loading equipment.  And control is needed over the entire loading process ‚Äî before the eyes of the authorities, no one will risk dropping valuable cargo onto the ground, and without control, the proletarians do not care, they will even jump on it. <br><br>  - all popular and demanded goods were sold somewhere in bulk, with a minimum mark-up.  We were reached almost alone by illiquid assets. <br><br>  The essence of the dealer business is as follows: the representative office gives the dealer a quota for the purchase of goods, where 60-80% are goods that will quickly be bought with a good markup, the rest, 20-40% are things that nobody in our country needs, if you are lucky - we will sell without mark-up If not lucky - at a loss. <br><br>  These are the orders.  The bosses of major manufacturing companies, the same Electrolux and Bosch, for some reason want to sell things in the CIS that simply cannot get into our apartments.  And these units have to be sold to rural residents for a penny - they can somehow be crammed into a private house. <br><br>  In a normal situation, something is sold at a loss, something "at zero", at least half - with a surcharge of 15-20-25%.  So, in the end, the dealer still earns 7-10% of the price of the consignment. <br><br>  Our "bosses" for some reason pushed all the goods in demand to my competitors with a margin of no more than 7-10%.  And all the illiquid was brought to my warehouse, also with a premium of 7-10%. <br><br>  The scene on the eve of the crash of the dealer business: <br><br>  All male employees, including me + temporary loaders, dressed in sweaty and dirty clothes, getting stupefied and dirty, unload the second day into the hangar overfilled under the roof of another truck of mysterious Chinese vacuum cleaners. <br><br>  Next to us is the uncle of my companion and thoughtfully says: "Suckers.  Lord, what fuckers ... " <br><br><h5>  Chapter three  Slightly tragic and dumb ... </h5><br>  Attempts to explain to petrochemists, ... <br><br>  - that - many goods brought to us are not needed by anyone, <br>  - that such a number of Chinese vacuum cleaners will be enough for our city for 2-3 years, at least <br>  - that we will not pay for the repair of bat equipment, and the broken one costs less than the purchase <br><br>  ... they politely agreed with us.  But they continued to do the same thing as before.  When the Chinese vacuum cleaners filled the entire hangar, all our personal garages and began to appear in our apartments, we ultimately refused to accept new trucks with goods. <br><br>  Oil businessmen didn‚Äôt stop it.  They removed additional warehouses in a nearby town.  And they continued to deliver something there. <br><br>  At the same time, they sent us commercial offers and prices: 20-30 product names, the price without VAT (it is necessary to multiply by 1.18 on the calculator), written in pen, scanned and sent to us as a PDF file.  Normal people made prices in MS Excel or CSV - you can always quickly analyze prices, recalculate them in different currencies and highlight the most advantageous positions, quickly insert into your price list for sellers. <br><br>  In the same week, the euro fell - and we realized that we flew.  Retail prices have fallen almost to the level of purchases.  We earned only the best product lines for shipping.  We had time to sell something, but so far this revenues did not cover the cost of renting a warehouse and loading and unloading.  In fact, everything contained on the income from online stores. <br><br>  While we raked the accumulated r ..., fate has prepared us a new unpleasant surprise. <br><br>  One evening, I was "pleased" by acquaintances from a nearby auto service: - You know, we have the guys here from the tax oil changed in the car.  So we saw that they are conducting an operational survey of your warehouse.  They fix who shipped what. <br><br>  We arrived! <br><br>  For free, these will not be unhooked.  At best, it is necessary to prepare a tidy sum, this is from an unprofitable activity.  At worst, they will try to confiscate the entire warehouse.  At that time, there was already accumulated all sorts of junk for 250 thousand USD.  If it is confiscated (and this is not difficult), then according to our laws, I remain owed the entire amount to the suppliers. <br><br>  So, our actions are as follows: <br>  - look for direct access to people who prepare to hit us, <br>  - to look for common friends, so that the conversation would be easier and more constructive <br>  - then look for the cheapest way to get rid of them with them <br><br>  But the tax authorities suddenly disappeared. <br>  No, they did not leave me alone, but disappeared from sight, they sunk into the water.  They did not come to finish the car in the next service.  Their cell phones were car repairmen known.  But all as one vigorously and politely answered "... the subscriber is temporarily unavailable or located outside the network coverage area." <br><br>  What happened to the tax authorities will tell, a little later.  There they had their own detective and action happened ... For now, let's leave our ill-fated warehouse of Chinese vacuum cleaners and fast forward to another theater of military operations - to a home appliances store. <br><br>  And from there, just got an invigorating phone call: We have OBEP and tax.  Conducted a test purchase, now the documents are checked, the goods are recounted ... <br><br>  And it was a different tax, from another district.  To understand what happened I will give some explanations: It was not with us, but with us, a hardware store.  Actually, it was someone else's furniture store.  But through it, our refrigerators-washers sold, and we shared a mark-up with the owners. <br><br>  And there he sold all electric utensils a guy by the name ... It does not matter what the name of this bad person is.  Let's call it, as bequeathed to call the bad people of the classics - Radish. <br>  So, Radish was not our employee.  Once upon a time, he temporarily earned money from us as a seller, and showed himself to be a talent in this business.  And the ill-fated year of our dealership, he was out of work and without a penny of money, and came to us to ask for help and employment.  We regretted Radish, and sent to the same Nenash shop.  Like, a capable guy.  The owner did not register him for work, but he allowed to hang out on the trading floor, and we promised a specific reward for each sold fridge. <br><br>  Radish traded quite successfully.  From the first month his salary reached the value he requested and exceeded it.  True, as it turned out, in his spare time from communicating with clients, he had saved money from us from the first day, in his naive sense.  He kept the addresses and phone numbers of clients in the special notebook (which was strictly forbidden), fixed the amount of revenue, etc ... A recent unemployed worker who borrowed $ 50 for food, as it became clear, considered us bloody exploiters, profiting from his work .  He sticks in here on the trading floor, and we must have a martini somewhere with girls who are lashing!  That is exactly what Radish thought and insidiously waited in the wings to restore justice, in his proletarian understanding.  And this hour has come. <br><br>  After 3 months of successful work Radish disappeared from the trading floor.  And with it disappeared the most expensive washing machine Ariston.  As it turned out, he successfully sold it for cash, handed over the order to the delivery service and made off.  The unpaid order was immediately identified and stopped, the control system worked for us.  But there remained a blatant customer who claimed that he paid the seller for this Ariston.  Call Radish. <br><br>  Radish replied the following: <br>  - Yes, he took the money from the client.  And he will not give them to us, because  Considers his legal premium for the hard work of the seller <br>  - we owe him another 2% of the turnover of the store for the entire period of work and in the future <br>  - if we have something against it, he will tell the whole truth about us tax, the police, state control and someone else <br><br>  Our answer to Radish: <br>  - money for a washing machine must be delivered to the store cash desk within an hour <br>  - otherwise, we file a complaint with the police about the fact of theft <br>  - we give him only previously agreed interest for the transactions concluded by him <br>  - let him go to hell, we no longer work with him and do not want to know <br><br>  Reaction Radishes: <br>  - by phone he said that he was proud and would not give us anything <br>  - after 15 minutes, contacted the delivery service driver and gave him the money <br>  - A day took, that we owed him.  He thanked me and said that we are dissatisfied in a good way. <br>  - A day later I went to the tax and police, and wrote interesting, detailed, full of all interesting details statements about us <br>  - I sat on the phone at home and started calling customers known to him: ‚ÄúThey sold you a marriage, they ordered you, the warranty was void, they collected all this equipment in the basement, urgently return the refrigerators and everything else!‚Äù <br>  - A couple of days later Radish came to us, began to ask back, sell refrigerators <br><br>  Luckily for us, Radish was very, very stupid.  He didn‚Äôt understand well what our actions were legitimate, which were not.  He believed that we stupidly do not pay taxes, we trade in smuggled goods.  This was not the case.  But, nevertheless, we had problems, and problems are serious enough: <br><br>  - warehouse under supervision, in the rapid development of tax officers.  Such developments were then carried out with one goal - all that is possible - to confiscate.  In stock - a stranger's goods for a quarter of a million dollars. <br><br>  - OBEP operatives and raid group of the second tax, actively shaking the store and demanding the management of the company before their bright eyes.  The documents in the store clearly showed that the goods were delivered there from that very warehouse.  That is, and from these, too, you can safely wait for a quick arrival at the warehouse. <br><br>  Question: will we withdraw or replenish the budget by 250 thousand dollars?  And what will we give to ety thousands of oil producers, to whom the product belongs? <br><br>  Well, added to this still excited customers, finding out whether we really collect Electrolux refrigerators in the Minsk basement;  where is this basement and is the warranty valid ... <br><br><h5>  Head uh uh, next, no number.  About the fact that there are no hopeless situations, as well as about the harm of bribes and theft of state property ... </h5><br>  The situation at that time seemed terrible to me.  I even turned a little gray from nervous tension.  But at such moments it is useless to be nervous.  It is necessary to calm down and correct the situation step by step. <br><br>  1. It is obvious that our most vulnerable place is a warehouse with dealer goods.  The very fact of its existence is a huge risk.  The goods can be confiscated, stolen, burned (near a car-care center and metalworking - welding works, pipes are sawing, sparks are flying).  This particular warehouse was poorly protected from any of these situations, with daily resources spent on its maintenance and protection. <br><br>  However, he did not bring any profit.  And, judging by the attitude of our "oil investors", it would never become profitable. The decision is obvious - to eliminate the warehouse.  Given the likely impact, it was necessary to do this the next night, before the morning meeting in all organs. <br>  In the evening, they ordered trucks, printed invoices for the return of goods to the ‚Äúoil industry workers‚Äù, put down the watchman‚Äôs grandfather for not letting him sleep on the night shift.  At night, from one to three I wandered around the surrounding area, and made sure that there were no people or other people's cars, no one was watching the warehouse. <br><br>  It‚Äôs hard to imagine for yourself now, but from 4 am to 10 pm, a huge amount of goods, unloaded for several days, was crammed into trucks and sent back to the petrochemical and dealer company.  We briefly described the situation to them, they accepted the return.  The goods from the garages and apartments were sold at minimal prices to some merchants from several regional centers.  Under the threat of possible confiscation, our partners agreed to this. <br><br>  Uh, got rid of this nonsense. <br><br>  2. Problems around the Radish lasted for another 3 weeks.  The tax and police hitting the store revealed that we are an extremely law-abiding company.  There was nothing to blame us for, but they didn‚Äôt invent any violations for the ears. <br><br>  In general, he himself apparently did not really like this whole thing.  According to Belarusian laws, any state bodies are obliged to respond to written statements of citizens within tightly stipulated terms.  This norm is actively used not only by people with real problems, but also by various troublemakers, extortionists and crazy people.  Like, give me a discount of $ 100, or I'll write to you in tax.  Recently, however, the court has fined one such "dreamer-complainant" for a thousand dollars. <br><br>  As they communicated with Radish, employees of the authorities apparently realized that he was a little out of his right mind.  But according to the law, he is a capable citizen, in the passport there are no specials.  tagging that he is a fool or limited in rights.  And within 24 hours (this efficiency even surprised me) from the moment of writing the statements, everyone who wrote to us came to us. <br><br>  We have been preparing for this situation for several years.  Sad experience has already been.  Constantly consulted with auditors, they themselves carried out checks of documents.  The times of desperate lawlessness on the part of the sovereign people were approaching their end, and the police and tax officers behaved quite correctly in relation to us.  There are no obvious violations - no complaints. <br><br>  Called to the bodies by the summons, the store director explained to the police that he knew Radish, but he had never recruited this man to the store.  Radish is known to him because he used to trade in the market of home appliances, constantly appeared in the store, pestered his employees, showing porn pictures and images of dildo, and once tried to steal a washing machine.  It was all true.  We scolded him for molesting girls a couple of times.  The police had no more questions.  The portrait of the client was quite believable. <br><br>  The police asked about the addresses of warehouses indicated in the application.  At least, we noticed near two garages with goods parked unfamiliar cars with tinted windows or curtains.  The engine is working, there are people in the cabin.  The biggest one was already empty, and on the others it was necessary to suspend work, check documents and put them in a sterile order. <br><br>  Seeing such calm, no one even tried to go inside.  For tomorrow, these cars have not appeared. <br><br>  3. There was no conflict with customers around the Radish.  People did not take him seriously.  It was enough of our explanations that they fired a man for theft, so he takes revenge.  There are doubts in technology - come to the store, see the certificates of Belstandard, the Ministry of Health, documents about the origin of the goods. <br><br>  All this, without exception, arranged it, especially since we solved the real problems in terms of breakdowns.  In addition to the warranty from the official service, we had our own regular master. <br><br>  4. The fate of the operatives who were spying on my warehouse was sad.  While they were following my staff, someone was watching them.  As it turned out later, in their free time from tracking, they knocked down bribes or ‚Äúconfiscated‚Äù the goods, and then plundered some of it.  In Belarus, such characters always evoke a keen interest among employees of competing security forces.  For their catch you can earn a promotion in the service or in the rank. <br><br>  By the time they came to my warehouse, they already knew enough about them, and they were going to delay tomorrow.  Therefore, all my attempts to reach them were in vain.  The next day, some were already sitting in their cells, someone was running and hiding from his colleagues from the police.  I, however, learned about it in two weeks only. <br><br>  Such is the boring conclusion of the mercenary "action movie".  Normal or even normalizing life, it is, as a rule, not particularly exciting. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/114759/">https://habr.com/ru/post/114759/</a></p>
