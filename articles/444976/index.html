  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Quester - Platform for creating and passing quests (Beta)</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><p>  Good day! </p><br><p>  The purpose of the article is to open to the public a platform that is being developed in his spare time and at the same time check how this platform sustains habra effect. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/afa/dac/755/afadac75575042a23a280192e94fb7ee.png" alt="image"></p><br><h2 id="soderzhanie">  Content </h2><br><ol><li>  Platform Description </li><li>  What is available today </li><li>  Technical details (we are still on Habr√©, and the honor must be known) </li><li>  Links and processes for those who are willing to try </li><li>  A request for the help of everyone </li></ol><br><p>  So let's get started! </p><br><h1 id="quester">  Quester </h1><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2 id="opisanie-platformy">  Platform Description </h2><br><p>  We all love quests and all sorts of riddles.  At one point, I realized that I would like to have a simple opportunity to create quests for my friends (and not only) in honor of some event, well, or just like that, for the sake of laughter. </p><br><p>  Well, since I was lucky to be a developer, "I would like to have" must necessarily turn into a "must-create"! </p><br><p>  From the user's point of view, Quester consists of 2 parts: </p><br><ul><li>  Portal for creating and modifying quests </li><li>  Application for the passage created earlier quests </li></ul><br><p>  If the human language - admin panel for the creators, the application for players. </p><br><p>  The moment, which for me was critical and obligatory - anyone can create quests, exactly as it passes. </p><br><p>  The quest itself is a set of actions that a player must perform. Action can be anything, starting with an answer to a question or a chekina at any particular point, and ending with more complex actions like ‚ÄúTake a picture of yourself with a can of Coca-Cola against a background "or" meet 10 players passing this quest, "Technically, any action is possible within the framework of this platform, the question is only in priorities and fantasy. </p><br><p>  And of course, we are talking about a certain form of a gami ed product; accordingly, at the end of the quest, the player must receive any reward, whether it be game points inside the platform, a gift coupon or a real gift. </p><br><p>  And all this is completely customizable by the creator of the quest! </p><br><h2 id="chto-dostupno-uzhe-seychas">  What is available now </h2><br><p>  The project is in beta version, so the functionality is not very extensive (but still worth mentioning on Habr√©, I don‚Äôt want to show you a landing here, but something working :)) </p><br><ul><li>  Admin panel  This is a web application where everyone can create and publish a quest.  The set of possible actions is so far limited to answering a question (with the possibility of several answers), scanning a QR code and checking in at a certain point. </li><li>  Application.  Here you can go quests created by you or any other users. </li><li>  Admin and application integration.  Created quests can be expanded as a link or a QR code that will be understood and opened by the application. </li></ul><br><p>  Links will be given below, but here I want to make a reservation - everything is all working on a staging environment, the production environment is not yet ready.  Therefore, do not be surprised links that have staging in the title. </p><br><h2 id="tehnicheskie-detali">  Technical details </h2><br><h4 id="backend">  Backend </h4><br><p>  Microservices, the only entry point from the outside is GraphQL endpoint, dockers node.js and a little Go, MongoDB as a base, everything is youthful and fashionable, ready for some fashionable conference. </p><br><h4 id="admintool">  AdminTool </h4><br><p>  React, Apollo GraphQL client.  Nothing particularly interesting, just a regular web application. </p><br><h4 id="prilozhenie">  application </h4><br><p>  React Native, respectively available on Android and iOS.  The Apollo GraphQL client for working with data is also nothing particularly interesting and complex. </p><br><h2 id="kak-poprobovat">  How to try </h2><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">If nothing opens</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><p>  Everything is on the Digital Ocean servers in a data center in London. <br>  I absolutely forgot about blocking in Russia, so most likely my server ip addresses are still on the blocked list. </p><br><p>  I apologize to all those who have so much to do with it and honestly sprinkle ashes on my head - a very unexpected joint on my part. </p><br><p>  At the moment I am trying to find a solution (well, that is, to find a cloud that will definitely not be blocked in Russia, and most likely it will be Yandex cloud. To be sure.) </p></div></div><br><p>  I repeat - the whole platform is in active development and is not yet ready to be called production-ready!  Everything should work, but everything, too, should shamelessly break with pleasure.  Please keep this in mind. </p><br><p>  So, user authorization only through Facebook.  The reason is as simple as possible - ease of implementation.  I do not collect any data about you except for the mail, the name and the avatar.  Read about GDPR and the ability to retire from the platform below. </p><br><ul><li>  Admin: <a href="https://admin-staging.quester-app.io/">https://admin-staging.quester-app.io/</a> </li><li>  Application: <br><ul><li>  Android: <a href="https://play.google.com/apps/testing/com.quester">Beta version of the application</a> </li><li>  iOS: works much less stable than Android version.  If you still decide to try, write me directly, I will send you the link personally </li></ul></li></ul><br><p>  Any comments, feedback and criticism are naturally welcome, preferably by email at support@quester-app.io.  There you can write and ask to delete all your data (GDPR compliant!) </p><br><h2 id="prosba-o-pomoschi">  Request for help </h2><br><p>  If you are interested in anything in this platform, be it a development, or a business part, or something else - write me at nikita@quester-app.io!  I will be happy to tell you more about the project, plans and everything else. At this point in time, the project is being developed by me for my own pleasure, but there are many interesting and varied plans in the plans. </p><br><p>  Thank you for attention, <br>  nikita@quester-app.io <br>  <a href="https://quester-app.io/">https://quester-app.io</a> </p></div>
