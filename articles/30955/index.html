  <section class="page js-page"><h1>IT is dying</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  I worked as an IT student for 22 years.  My goal, like the goal of many other system administrators, was to remain inconspicuous.  According to ITshnikov, an ideal system is a properly working system that does not attract attention, but ‚Äújust works as it should‚Äù.  But did they award me or any other admin for excellent work?  Nifiga like!  Was the guy whose server regularly crashed?  Also nifiga!  Moreover, he was promoted for correcting emergency situations.  Those same situations that he himself provoked his short-sightedness.  That's why IT is dead. <br><br>  In management, accounting, and-dd, if you pay attention to yourself, then you get a promotion.  You have to do something to be noticed.  Something cool and bright.  But IT is different.  The coolest and brightest thing that can happen is to burn UPS, followed by a fire in the server room.  And this can not be called a good result. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  However, it is precisely this garbage that an outsourcing IT company has to deal with in order to convince the management that it is not for nothing that she gets her money.  I was really asked to dramatize emergency situations (mainly on the eve of budget consideration), and only after correcting these situations could they approvingly pat us on the back.  I know a dozen ways to disable a server and substantiate it with anything, even a lightning strike, but not by deliberate actions.  Gradually, I practically ceased to perform my duties in good faith, and began to worry mainly about salary.  Finally, when my career came full PE, I understood how this business works, where honesty and professional ethics lead to layoffs.  In my case, it happened twice.  I'm learning pretty slowly.  And now I try to regain my inner motivation.  But at least I can afford it. <br><br>  When I worked directly in an outsourcing IT company, I had a period of 3 years without a single server failure.  Suddenly, the management placed the server in my office, which almost guaranteed weekly crashes.

      But managers like it! <br><br>  Soon when the servers began to fall, managers had the opportunity to notice how quickly we were able to restore their performance (it‚Äôs not difficult, especially if you planned and predicted what exactly would fall off and in what order) and added money to us.  From this point on, my job was not to prevent problems, but to quickly solve them.  But how far we have risen in the eyes of managers.  It is as simple as a hook, fishing line and sinker.  And so we acted in several companies. <br><br>  Managers were not able to understand that every server failure costs them not only IT services to restore its efficiency, but also lost potential customers.  No fucking presentation!  When other employees tried to solve the problem in their language of numbers, the managers stubbornly did not want to listen to anything.  Sayles pretty well powdered their brains.  Do not listen to your own employees!  Later, I understood why this is happening: managers, by virtue of their nature and their experience, simply cannot believe in the honesty and good intentions of other people.  When I was working in the pre-sales department (by that time, I had already sold my soul to the devil) I could live to see how sales people do everything: lie, cheat, and even steal, just to sign this contract.  And then bring down this tub with promises to direct performers.  The poor performers came back and said that the promise either in principle does not exist or cannot be fulfilled (and I knew that this could not be done, and I said this to sales, but he asked me to keep silent in the presence of the client).  In the end, all the bumps flew into the performers!  And sales people quietly received their unhealthy interest from the deal, part went to me, and that poor guy who tried to get the bulldozer to fly never received a promotion. <br><br>  That's why IT is dead, dudes.  It is impossible to lie to the computer.  You need to either enter the data correctly, or nothing happens.  Most of the technical people I‚Äôve met with are honest guys.  I would even say brutally honest.  But honesty is a flaw in our modern business world.  Thus, the mindset that allows a person to be a good specialist interferes with progress in a modern ‚Äúmarket economy‚Äù.  In it, capitalism - as it is.  No ethical standards.  Honesty sucks.  Who has more dough - the cooler. <br><br>  Thus, if you are a good IT person, you have theoretically and virtually no chance to make a good career.  If you try to do something bright - you are NOT a good IT person.  You can be the most creative brow, but in the IT world it is not necessary.  ITshnik must perform its work reliably, thoroughly and imperceptibly.  Nevertheless, if you do not anneal to the full, you can immediately say goodbye to your hopes for a successful career.  Heck, in most IT companies, an employee simply has nowhere to go.  Want to move - go to the managers or sales.  But put your conscience in front of this at the farthest door (or even better, shoot it, burn it and bury it).  Because I have not met a single person with a conscience in more than 500 companies with whom I dealt during my rather long career.  These professions have completely different coordinate systems. <br><br>  That's why IT is dead.  Society teaches us that if you want to move forward, do not bother with the technique.  You can immediately forget about the technique.  Better to know all aspects of manipulating people.  Sell ‚Äã‚Äãyour soul to any gods and demons in which you believe and get a management education with an emphasis on the psychology of management (both people alone and in crowds).  The better you can use people, the farther you go.  To study the technique is a difficult matter.  She changes every day.  The ability to manipulate people changes little over time, so practice it as often as possible. <br><br>  I apologize for some confusion of my statement.  It really cost me to put these thoughts into full-fledged fasting, perhaps with a lesser amount of cynicism and bring more evidence.  But I really can no longer be a naive ass.  I realized that nothing shines in IT and quit.  I changed my profession, and may God bless anyone who does the same, because IT for honest, tech-savvy people who just want everything to ‚Äújust work, as it should be,‚Äù gets worse and worse every day. <br><br>  <font>Translator's Notes:</font> <font><br></font>  <font>This is my first translation for Habr, so please do not kick it with your feet, but rather write where / what should be improved.</font>  <font>When translating, I tried to preserve the intonation and spirit of the original as much as possible.</font> <font><br></font>  <font>Also please note that the opinion of the translator may not coincide with the opinion of the author.</font> <font><br></font> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/30955/">https://habr.com/ru/post/30955/</a></p>
