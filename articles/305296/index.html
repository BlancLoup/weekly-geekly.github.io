  <section class="page js-page"><h1>MIPT launched an online magistracy in modern combinatorics</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Starting next year, ten students will be able to study in a full-fledged magistracy MIPT and get a state diploma without leaving home.  Leading foreign universities, such as Harvard and Stanford, already have programs of this kind, but for Russia this is an unprecedented educational experiment.  The culture of online learning already developed at the PhysTech, associated with projects such as courses at Coursera, NPOO and Lectorium, run by the same team responsible for the online magistracy at MFTI, adds confidence in its success. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/1ba/a55/88c/1baa5588c18444cb9dd4f495273e6caa.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <a href="http://omsc.mipt.ru/%3Futm_source%3Dhabr%26utm_medium%3Dpost%26utm_campaign%3Domsc_enroll">Education in the online magistracy</a> will be carried out in the direction of "Modern Combinatorics".  For teaching sections of applied and fundamental mathematics in the new format, advanced teachers are needed.  One of these specialists is Andrei Raygorodsky, a world-renowned scientist and head of the department of discrete mathematics at MIPT.

The student independently masters the lecture material in the Mass Open Online Course (MOOK) format on the miptX platform.  Many online graduate courses are already running on the largest platforms - Coursera and NPOO.  Online graduate students will have access to already updated versions of these courses.  Some courses, for example, the course ‚ÄúPhilosophy and Methodology of Natural Science‚Äù, were developed specifically for ‚ÄúModern combinatorics‚Äù, and students of the online magistracy will see them first. <br>  <b>Consulting hours.</b>  The synchronous part of the training.  The teacher is available to chat online with students for a period of time.  Each student can remotely "connect" to the teacher and ask the question of interest to him, discuss with him a difficult moment of proof, etc.  This format is widely used on the Coursera platform and has been successfully tested in our courses. <br>  <b>Scientific work.</b>  Each student chooses his supervisor and the topic of scientific work on the basis of one of the partner organizations of the master's program.  The scientific work is carried out under the remote supervision of the supervisor. <br>  <b>Passing exams and tests.</b>  It passes remotely.  It consists of two parts - written and oral.  In the first part of the exam, students will solve a test in the mode of identification.  After that, the teacher conducts a small oral survey and puts the assessment.  This whole process takes place under the supervision of a specialist - proctor.  He gets access to the student's computer, through a webcam monitors all his movements and pupils.  The proctoring procedure was successfully tested by us on our courses for NPOO several times.  <u>Personal presence in the MIPT is required only on passing the state qualification examinations of the master and the defense of the master's thesis</u> <br><br>  <b>Who will be interested in online magistracy MIPT?</b>  Those who want to combine work and education, as well as those who live far from Moscow and the Physical and Technical Institute, but want to get an education in the leading university of the country and knowledge from world-class specialists.  This year, training in the online magistracy will be carried out on a fee basis, although the organizers provide an opportunity to receive financial assistance.  A significant advantage of the online magistracy is also the right to live in the MIPT hostel, and therefore fully participate in the social life of the university, while retaining the opportunity to manage their time / <br><br>  <b>Please note:</b> admission to the online magistracy occurs according to the same rules as admission to a regular magistracy.  You need to register and submit documents within the prescribed period.  Details on the <a href="http://omsc.mipt.ru/%3Futm_source%3Dhabr%26utm_medium%3Dpost%26utm_campaign%3Domsc_enroll">page of the magistracy.</a> <br><br>  To take part in the competition, you need <a href="http://omsc.mipt.ru/%3Futm_source%3Dhabr%26utm_medium%3Dpost%26utm_campaign%3Domsc_enroll">to submit an application on the website of the online magistracy</a> .  Hurry up, the number of places is limited, and there are more and more willing every day! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/305296/">https://habr.com/ru/post/305296/</a></p>
