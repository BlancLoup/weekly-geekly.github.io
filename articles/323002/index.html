Let's see what happened. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  <b>1. Study TK</b> <br>  The worst thing that can happen to the order performer is not being able to sort out the requirements and not complete the order.  To understand the client in general is not enough - even if he does not demand the impossible and does not want to ‚Äúride a bicycle to the moon‚Äù (and most likely, he wants to).

      Any misunderstood detail is a source of headache.  Half of all problematic situations can be prevented at the negotiation stage.  However, if the customer is English-speaking, then you can understand exactly what exactly he wants, only knowing the language well.  Difficulties with the study of TK are often forced to abandon profitable projects. <br><br>  For example, one of the students of EnglishDom shared his experience that he did not translate the phrase <br>  at your discretion (at your discretion) in the section where the design of the personal account of the site administrator was described.  After that, he almost daily demanded details of the design from a foreign customer until everything was explained to him ‚Äúon the fingers‚Äù.  As a result, he delayed the project for a week and a half. <br><br>  <b>2. Teamwork</b> <br>  If the project manager took over negotiations with the customer, it will make life easier for the performers.  But if you work in an international project, there will always be questions that need to be discussed directly with colleagues.  The code itself is, of course, a universal thing, but meetings, retrospectives, and refactoring have to be conducted in human languages. <br><br>  Again, let's take as an example the experience of our student.  In his work, he repeatedly encountered the need for decomposition.  Usually decomposition is a process that takes a lot of time, and now imagine when it must first be translated from English and explained in detail.  Then penetrate, making sure the details.  On average, it takes a couple of days to decompose for a sprint of one and a half or two weeks, and if everything is stated in English, which you do not know, another plus day.  And this may lead to a breakdown of the deadlines. <br><br>  <b>3. Research</b> <br>  Search for information on profile resources, blogs, in the community (Stack Overflow, Quora, GitHub), among videos on YouTube.  To do this, you need to develop reading and listening skills (listening comprehension) in English. <br><br>  So, one of our students said that in the company where he works, several employees simultaneously learn English.  At their leisure, they themselves are looking for good video / audio or an article in English, and then they watch everything together in order to understand everything and explain the difficult moments to each other. <br><br>  <b>4. Demonstration examination</b> <br>  Ignorance of the English language stops, if you need to show your knowledge, but not enough conversational skills.  Or when it is necessary to substantiate your choice in a dispute with colleagues.  For example, if a Delhi developer makes a fatal mistake, recommending ActiveRecord for working with an RDBMS, or claiming that coroutine is a birthmark of asynchrony ‚Äî how can you not say anything? <br><br>  But if you are not strong enough in spoken English, you better have a discussion in writing - on the forum, etc., since there you can take enough time to think and decide on the words and formulations. <br><br>  <b>5. Relocation</b> <br>  New interesting tasks, attractive salary and the opportunity to see the world.  And here without knowledge of a foreign language is not enough.  To go to the nearest supermarket for groceries or order a cup of coffee to the waiter, a few words in broken English are enough.  It is quite another thing - full communication with colleagues and neighbors. <br><br>  Again, let's take as an example the experience of our student: he only succeeded relocate because he is a very strong php programmer.  But as a condition they demanded to go through the Bridging course (an additional course to increase the level of the language).  Only after the end of this course, he was raised to the level promised initially. <br><br>  <b>Let's sum up</b> <br>  If you want to grow as a specialist - invest your time in learning English.  He will definitely come in handy! <br><br>  <b>Bonuses for Habr's readers</b> <br><br>  <b>Online Courses</b> <br>  We give you access for a year to the English course for self-study "Online course". <br>  To access, simply follow the <a href="https://www.englishdom.com/myprofile/purchases/habra212/%3Futm_medium%3Dblog%26utm_source%3Dhabrahabr">link</a> . <br><br>  <b>Individually by Skype</b> <br>  Specialized course " <a href="https://www.englishdom.com/skype/courses/it/%3Futm_medium%3Dblog%26utm_source%3Dhabrahabr">English for IT-specialists</a> " <br>  Classes are held at any time convenient for you. <br>  <b>Promo code</b> for 15% discount: <b>habra15</b> <br>  Valid until April 1st.
