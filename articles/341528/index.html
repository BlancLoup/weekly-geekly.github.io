  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Implementing a CA PPM Project Management System in Mars</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Since the beginning of 2017, Mars began the implementation of the corporate project management system CA Clarity PPM.  Today, all the structures of our company to one degree or another use this platform, and for project teams it is the main one.  In this publication, we will talk about the process of system implementation and its main advantages. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/e0/_t/dp/e0_tdpklz6gondj1m8pcteqz_mu.jpeg"></div><a name="habracut"></a><br><h3>  Prerequisites for the implementation of the platform </h3><br>  CA Clarity PPM (Project &amp; Portfolio management) is a project management platform from CA Technologies.  The system allows you to see the status of each project at any time with the desired level of detail, which allows you to properly allocate resources and employment of employees.  As a result, projects, as they say, fall into the budget, deadlines and quality. <br><br>  In turn, this allows you to make strategically correct and calculated decisions, track and highlight the most priority needs, optimize your product portfolio.

      Previously, we used tools that were not the most convenient for work, such as the Lotus Notes database, which included project deadlines, and Sharepoint, where resource planning was carried out.  These are not enough flexible and manual products that did not allow us to closely control tasks, statuses and finances. <br><br>  In contrast, CA PPM is not only a complete solution integrated with SAP, but also accurate information that can be presented in various forms and formats.  The advantage of using CA PPM is to provide a transparent picture of current projects throughout the organization globally.  As well as transparency in planning investments in new projects for business. <br><br>  Previously, the project manager took from one to two hours a week to fill in various forms, now this time has been reduced to 15 minutes with a very user-friendly interface, which can be used intuitively. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/is/pb/sv/ispbsvh9xgebfbrjzvul0ljlpgu.jpeg"><br><br>  Budget management has become much easier: all the information on expenses is taken from SAP, there is no need to consolidate information from various sources.  As a result, we have a complete picture of the time spent on the implementation of equipment costs, payment of contractor services, etc. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/vj/ig/ae/vjigaerp5y9sp6hj4fn5lqca2je.jpeg"><br><br><h2>  How we implemented the tool </h2><br>  The work was planned.  At the first stage, IT business partners and a project management office (PMO) switched to a new platform.  Then CA PPM began to use implementation and development teams (Deployment and Development), and the rest of the service teams followed them. <br><br>  The secret of a successful project launch, in our opinion, lies in serious preparatory work, during which the platform was tested, and all the material was carefully worked out.  Representatives of all teams took part in the test to ensure that the tool fully meets the needs of the entire organization.  Also, trainings were conducted depending on the functional team in which the tool will be implemented. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ax/eq/pg/axeqpgv15fcdvmeow505srae7ow.png"><br><br>  The transition itself took place simultaneously for both new and current projects. <br><br>  Surprisingly, there were practically no errors in the system after launch.  The tool is very dynamic, easily adjusted to our needs in the changing conditions of the IT environment.  This is the responsibility of the specially created Planning &amp; Execution team, which also deals with the relationship with the developer. <br><br>  We keep track of user feedback and constantly implement changes and improvements that fit into the new Mars operating model. <br><br>  <i>If there are those among the readers of the blog who have worked with this product of CA Technologies, we will be happy to hear your feedback on working with the CA Clarity PPM project management platform and share experiences.</i> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/341528/">https://habr.com/ru/post/341528/</a></p>
