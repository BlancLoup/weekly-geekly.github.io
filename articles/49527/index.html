This is an attempt to formalize - what are the projects that are based on users and materials posted by users.  And by that you can mean anything.  Social networks and services, recommended social services (which are now trying hard to defend their right to be called Web 3.0). <br><br>  Suppose we poked a finger into the sky and hit a gold mine.  Namely - we analyzed the market correctly, saw the trends, determined for ourselves that our idea has the right to life.  What's next?  If you yourself have sufficient funds to implement the idea - then proceed immediately to the implementation of the prototype, after you write the financial plan and understand that there are enough funds. <br><br>  Usually everything is wrong. <a name="habracut"></a>

      To do something you need to have time to develop.  This means that you should have monthly and stable money for the most necessary things - food, shelter, clothing.  Everyone's situations are different.  If you have a mother who feeds and that you live in - a great option for the project :) If there is a business that does not require your 100% involvement, it is even more beautiful. <br>  You can do a project at night or on weekends ... but this immediately increases the risk of its failure. <br><br>  Therefore, it is worthwhile to immediately assess the necessary degree of your involvement in the project and what funds are necessary for this involvement to be possible. <br><br>  In the case of a programmer who decided to develop his project - the degree of involvement in the project should be 80-90% of the time, at least at the start-up stage. <br><br>  The degree of involvement of the manager (in this understanding - the coordinator of the entire project and performing specific functions - for example, writing TK or materials or - approximately 50-70% of the time) <br><br>  Absolutely elementary things are usually not taken into account by those who try to assemble a team for themselves, or by those who try to give the team money to complete the project - this is where the breaks come from. <br><br>  The main mistake that employers make is in the standard method of doing business - let's optimize our costs so that we like them.  And the trap into which such employers fall is the mass of proposals for the same free-lance.ru to work for $ 100 - as a result of work in progress and $ 100 * n wasted. <br><br>  Wise investors require BP and investment calculation.  If you think from the point of view of investors, this is justified; if you think from the point of view of a viable project, a project driven into the framework of the need to write costs and expenses only in accordance with these articles is unproductive for a startup.  The idea should lead, not what you have written in the budget.  A completely different question is that it is necessary to write a financial plan for at least three years.  For yourself and for the success of the project.  Just understand that this is a estimate.  That the estimate is usually at odds with reality and reality is usually more rigid than what is written on paper.  those.  all the costs that you wrote as a must must be multiplied by 1.5 to get approximately what you spend. <br><br>  The most basic costs are payroll and promotion.  Break the project into stages.  Each stage should give some response after launch.  Write a concept.  Do not be afraid at the concept stage to reveal the secrets of your project and share them with the community.  Fear of theft of ideas haunts those who understand very little in project implementation.  The concept is only the first step towards implementation, then TK follows, a financial plan (or more generally, BP), interface drawing, design, layout, programming.  If your idea is ‚Äústolen‚Äù no one can better realize what you have invented.  So no one will ‚Äústeal the idea‚Äù without its carrier.  Rather, they will buy you as a carrier of an idea and a person capable of bringing it to life, if the idea seems good. <br><br>  If you are discussing a concept in communities, do not pay attention to either the positive color of the responses or the negative.  Pay attention only to the number of these responses.  If there are a lot of responses - most likely the idea is interesting ... </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/49527/">https://habr.com/ru/post/49527/</a></p>
