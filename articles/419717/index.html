I would like to talk about the architecture of embedded applications.  Unfortunately, there are very few books on this topic, and due to the fact that, recently, interest in embedded and IoT is growing, I would like to pay attention to this issue.  In this article, I would like to describe one of the possible options for how you can design such applications. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  This is a debatable question!  Therefore, they offer to share their vision in the comments! <br>  To begin with, let's define the area: in this article, under embedded development, we mean software development under microcontrollers (hereinafter referred to as MK, for example STM32) in C / Asm. <br>  Projects for systems based on MK can be divided into <b>not requiring</b> and <b>requiring</b> multitasking.  As for the solutions of the first type, they are usually not very complex (from a structural point of view).  For example, a simple project, in which it is necessary to read data from a sensor and display it on the screen, does not require multitasking; here it is enough to implement the sequential execution of the listed operations. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ds/cg/nk/dscgnkhungdn4r6lo0lknunuwr8.png">

      If the application is more complex: within the framework of which it is necessary to read data from both digital sensors and analog ones, save the obtained values ‚Äã‚Äãin memory (for example, to an sd card), serve the user interface (display + keyboard), provide access to data through digital interface (for example, RS-485 / Modbus or Ethernet / TCP / IP) and quickly respond to certain events in the system (pressing the emergency buttons, etc.), in this case it will be difficult to do without multitasking.  There are two ways to solve the problem of multitasking: implement it yourself, or use some kind of operating system (hereinafter OS).  Today, one of the most popular real-time operating systems for embedded systems is FreeRTOS. <br><br>  Let's try to imagine how the architecture of a ‚Äúcomplex‚Äù embedded application that performs a rather large number of heterogeneous operations should look like.  I admit that it is possible to propose an even more complex variant, which involves solving the problems of sound processing, cryptography, etc., but we will dwell on the variant that was described just above. <br><br>  We set the task more clearly, even though within our application it is necessary: <br><br><ul><li>  Read data from sensors on the RS-485 / Modbus bus. </li><li>  Read data from sensors on the I2C bus. </li><li>  Read data from discrete inputs. </li><li>  Manage relay output. </li><li>  Serve user interface (display + keyboard). </li><li>  Provide access to data via RS-485 / Modbus. </li><li>  Save data to external media. </li></ul><br>  Since  we need to implement a sufficiently large number of different subtasks; we will use a real-time operating system (for example, the above-mentioned FreeRTOS) as a base.  Threads in the OS will sometimes be called tasks - by analogy with FreeRTOS.  I just want to warn you: the source code in the article will not be, it is the architectural aspect of this issue that is interesting. <br><br>  If you analyze the task, you can see that different components of the system use the same data.  For example: data from the sensors must be obtained, displayed on the screen, written to media and provided to external systems for reading.  This suggests that we need some kind of real-time database (RTDB) for storing and for providing the most up-to-date data to various subsystems. <br><br>  Tasks performed in the system (data read, write, display, etc.) may have different requirements for the frequency of their call.  It makes no sense to update the data on the display with a frequency of 1 every 100 ms, because  this is not critical for a person, but it is often necessary to read data from sensors (especially if it is necessary to issue control actions on them) (although it may not depending on the TK).  Another important point relates to the solution of the problem of accessing the same data for reading and writing.  For example: the stream interrogating the sensors writes the obtained values ‚Äã‚Äãto RTDB, and at this moment the stream responsible for updating the information on the display reads them.  Here we will be helped by the synchronization mechanisms provided by the operating system. <br><br>  Let's start designing the architecture of our application! <br><br><h2>  Real time database </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/pb/u1/bu/pbu1bu9dgrjklvl0p_xr-svgsau.png"><br><br>  As such a base can be a regular structure containing the required set of fields or an array.  To access ‚ÄúRTDB‚Äù, we will use an API that will allow us to write and read data from the database.  Synchronization of access to data within API functions can be built on mutexes provided by the OS (or use some other mechanism). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/x3/bl/1i/x3bl1ihf07mt6nf-hgpfyrr9mrk.png"><br><br><h2>  Work with sensors on tires </h2><br>  Working with sensors implies the following: <br><br><ul><li>  reading data; </li><li>  data processing (if necessary), which includes: <br><ul><li>  validation check; </li><li>  scaling; </li><li>  filtering; </li><li>  validation test; </li></ul><br></li><li>  write the received data to RTDB. </li></ul><br>  All this work can be done in one task. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/la/ua/sb/lauasbvner90pd5zzw3fs0wn41c.png"><br><br>  ‚ÄúPort‚Äù - real port of MK; <br>  ‚ÄúProtocol driver‚Äù - protocol driver (for example, Modbus).  For such a driver, it is desirable to make your interface and work through it.  Within the framework of such an interface, it is possible to implement access control to the resource through mutexes, as this was done for ‚ÄúRTDB‚Äù.  Some developers suggest doing this at the port level to ensure that no one else writes anything to this port while we send our Modbus packets through it. <br>  ‚ÄúSensor reader‚Äù - the task (task), which polls the sensors, puts in order the received information and records it in ‚ÄúRTDB‚Äù. <br><br>  ‚ÄúRTDB‚Äù is the real-time database described above in the corresponding section. <br>  The inscription ‚ÄúPr: 1‚Äù above the task means priority, the bottom line is that each task can have a priority if the two tasks waiting for processor time have a different priority, the resource that has a higher priority.  If tasks have the same priority, then the one that has a longer wait time will start. <br><br><h2>  Work with discrete inputs </h2><br>  In general, the work with discrete inputs can be organized in the same way as with digital sensors.  But it may be necessary to respond quickly to changes in the state of the inputs.  For example, by pressing the button as soon as possible to close the relay output.  In this case, it is better to apply the following approach: for processing the relay output, we create a special separate task with a higher priority than the others.  Inside this task is a semaphore, which it is trying to capture.  An interrupt is triggered to trigger a particular discrete input, in which the semaphore mentioned above is reset.  Since  interrupt priority is maximum, then the function associated with it will be executed almost instantly, in our case, it will reset the semaphore, and after that, the next task in the execution queue will be the one within which the relay is controlled (since it has priority is higher than other tasks and the lock on pending semaphore is removed). <br>  This is how the scheme of this subsystem may look like. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/cr/ow/2_/crow2_gsalrlns7yorool3w6hwu.png"><br><br>  In addition to the quick response to the state change of a specific input, you can optionally set the ‚ÄúDI reader‚Äù task to read the status of discrete inputs.  This task can be either independent or caused by a timer. <br><br>  The work of ‚ÄúInterrupt handler‚Äù and ‚ÄúRelay controller‚Äù in the form of diagrams is presented below. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/yz/1r/yu/yz1ryutqdblpajcszdhhonkfkk8.png"><br><br><h2>  Write data to external media </h2><br>  Writing data to external media is ideologically very similar to reading data from digital sensors, only the movement of data is carried out in the opposite direction. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/dd/re/op/ddreop78fgjkhdhs4ncjzs6wadm.png"><br><br>  We read from ‚ÄúRTDB‚Äù and write it via ‚ÄúStore driver‚Äù to external media - this can be an SD card, USB flash drive or something else.  Again, do not forget to put a mutex wrapper (or any other tools for organizing access to the resource) in the interface function! <br><br><h2>  Providing access to real-time data </h2><br>  Important is the moment of providing data from ‚ÄúRTDB‚Äù to external systems.  It can be almost any interfaces and protocols.  Unlike the number of considered subsystems, the key difference is that some of the protocols widely used in automation systems impose special requirements on the response time to the request, if the answer does not come within a certain time, it is considered that there is no such device. communication, even if he (the answer) comes after a while.  And since  access to ‚ÄúRTDB‚Äù in our example may be temporarily blocked (by the mutex) it is necessary to provide for the protection of an external master device (master is a device that tries to read data from ours) from such a lock.  It is also worthwhile to provide for the protection of the device itself against the fact that the master will interrogate it with a high frequency, thereby slowing down the operation of the system by constantly reading from ‚ÄúRTDB‚Äù.  One solution is to use an intermediate buffer. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/wl/km/rr/wlkmrrvydtlmq8jxzxkofdvjrzg.png"><br><br>  The ‚ÄúData updater‚Äù reads data from ‚ÄúRTDB‚Äù at specified intervals and adds what it read into the ‚ÄúProtocol cache‚Äù, from which the ‚ÄúProtocol handler‚Äù will take the data.  In this case, there is a blocking problem at the level of the protocol cache, to solve it, you can create another cache in which the ‚ÄúProtocol handler‚Äù will store data in case you could not read from the blocked ‚ÄúProtocol cache‚Äù, you can additionally: <br>  - make ‚ÄúProtocol handler‚Äù a higher priority; <br>  - increase the reading period from ‚ÄúRTDB‚Äù for ‚ÄúData updater‚Äù (which is so-so solution). <br><br><h2>  Work with user interface </h2><br>  Working with the user interface involves updating the data on the screen and working with the keyboard.  The architecture of this subsystem may look like this. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ky/gi/lb/kygilbpcxnocpiibditqifuysre.png"><br><br>  The UI worker is engaged in reading keystrokes, retrieving data from ‚ÄúRTDB‚Äù and updating the display that the user sees. <br><br><h2>  General structure of the system </h2><br>  Now take a look at what happened in the end. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/t9/kg/tp/t9kgtp-kujcs9plimib5txgrrb0.png"><br><br>  In order to balance the load, you can put additional caches, as we did in the subsystem responsible for providing data access to external systems.  Part of the task of transferring data can be solved using queues, since they are usually supported by real-time operating systems (in FreeRTOS for sure). <br>  That's all, I hope it was interesting. <br><br>  <b>PS</b> <br>  As a literature, I would advise ‚ÄúMaking Embedded Systems: Design Patterns for Great Software‚Äù Elecia White and <a href="http://easyelectronics.ru/img/ARM_kurs/FreeRTOS/Kurniz.pdf">Andrei</a> Kurnitz‚Äôs article <a href="http://easyelectronics.ru/img/ARM_kurs/FreeRTOS/Kurniz.pdf">‚ÄúFreeRTOS - an operating system for microcontrollers‚Äù</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/419717/">https://habr.com/ru/post/419717/</a></p>
