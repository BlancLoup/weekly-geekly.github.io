  <section class="page js-page"><h1>13 business startups with the largest capitalization</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Business startups focused on the sale of their own services in the field of B2B in recent years have become the main goal of application of funds in the venture capital environment.  There was even a special term ‚Äúunicorn‚Äù (‚Äúunicorn‚Äù), which defines private (not public, that is, those whose shares are not traded on open stock exchanges) companies worth (ie capitalization) more than $ 1 billion. <br><br>  What is not surprising - most of them still exist in debt, on funds invested in the company.  Some of them are already earning a lot of money, but somehow they are not a ‚Äúprofitable business‚Äù from the traditional point of view. <br><br>  Business Insider, using the data published by Forbes and information aggregated by the startup <a href="http://mattermark.com/">Mattermark,</a> <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/13-cloud-startups-with-the-most-venture-capital-funding-2015-3%3Fop%3D1">collected</a> 13 of the most expensive "cloud business startups".  They are presented below, in increasing order, in terms of the valuation of assets.

      Most of the projects under consideration are particularly interesting for the potential copying of business models in the Russian context, since financial and business services are equally in demand throughout the world. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  13th place: Zuora - $ 242.5 million investment </h4><br>  <a href="https://www.zuora.com/">Zuora</a> is a platform that allows companies to manage subscriptions and recurring (regular and automatic) payments. <br><br><h4>  12th place: Domo - $ 248.7 million investment </h4><br>  <a href="http://www.domo.com/">Domo</a> provides various business intelligence (BI) tools that help executives and top managers in companies to get the most out of useful information from ‚Äúreports‚Äù and ‚Äúbig data‚Äù that go to specialized control panels. <br><br><h4>  11th place: NewVoiceMedia - $ 261.3 million investment </h4><br>  <a href="http://www.newvoicemedia.com/en-us/">NewVoiceMedia</a> makes a browser extension allowing the sales support team to communicate with consumers using a simple voice tool integrated with Salesforce. <br><br><h4>  10 place: SimpliVity - $ 276.5 million investment </h4><br>  <a href="http://www.simplivity.com/">SimpliVity</a> is engaged in merging server infrastructure and storage services into a single solution delivered ‚Äúin box‚Äù to business users. <br><br><h4>  9th place: Good Technology - $ 291.3 million investment </h4><br>  <a href="http://www.goodtechnology.com/">Good Technology</a> helps its own customers manage work files and data on smartphones and tablets, while at the same time caring for their safety. <br><br><h4>  8th place: Mozido - 307.2 million investment </h4><br>  <a href="http://www.mozido.com/">Mozido</a> being the ‚Äúearliest‚Äù start-up of all those considered (recently held a round of the ‚ÄúB‚Äù series) creates a product for online stores that allows you to accept payments from customers who do not even have a bank account or smartphone.  Another point: this company has almost no competitors, even in the West. <br><br><h4>  7th place: MongoDB - $ 311.1 million investment </h4><br>  <a href="http://www.mongodb.com/">MongoDB's</a> popular solution for organizing scalable databases using NoSQL technology hardly needs to be introduced to our public.  One of the undisputed leaders in its industry. <br><br><h4>  6th place: Nutanix - $ 312.2 million investment </h4><br>  <a href="http://www.nutanix.com/">Nutanix</a> , like SimpliVity, is another representative of ‚Äúinfrastructure blending‚Äù projects, providing consumers with computing power and disk space in one easy-to-buy and easy-to-manage package.  VMWare is a serious competitor, but Nutanix is ‚Äã‚Äãone of the recognized leaders in the industry, generating more than $ 300 million in revenue per year. <br><br><h4>  5th place: Deem - $ 516.9 million investment </h4><br>  <a href="http://www.deem.com/">Deem</a> is an atypical representative of the world of e-commerce for business, helping to save money on various car rental services (for business) before purchasing office supplies.  The company also has products for marketing products from other companies and finding new customers.  An interesting example of work in the market of services. <br><br><h4>  4th place: Pure Storage - $ 534.9 million investment </h4><br>  <a href="http://www.purestorage.com/">Pure Storage</a> is the first ‚Äúiron‚Äù company in the list, producing SSD for business.  ‚ÄúFaster, higher, stronger‚Äù - all this is about this company.  The company's business is so good that their closest competitor, Fusion-io, which has more modest performance, was bought by SanDisk last year, with a total valuation of the business somewhere between $ 1.1 and $ 3 billion.  But Pure Storage does not want either takeover or IPO: ‚Äúwe are well and so.‚Äù <br><br><h4>  3rd place: Palantir Technologies - $ 950 million investment </h4><br>  Mysterious big-data startup <a href="https://www.palantir.com/">Palantir</a> has attracted investments and makes money mainly due to government contracts with various services (such as intelligence) of the United States.  CEO Alexander Karp prefers not to spread about business to the public, and is not going to IPO: "it would become difficult for us to conduct our activities." <br><br><h4>  2 place: Dropbox - $ 1.1 billion investment </h4><br>  It will be inappropriate to explain the essence of <a href="http://www.dropbox.com/">Dropbox</a> business - almost everyone knows the company, because in fact it created the market for automatically synchronized file storages in a user-friendly form.  The recent drop in quotations of the main competitor - Box, due to non-fulfillment of investors' expectations for revenues and profits, explains why Dropbox postpones its initial offering on the stock exchange. <br><br><h4>  1st place: Cloudera - $ 1.2 billion investment </h4><br>  <a href="http://www.cloudera.com/content/cloudera/en/home.html">Cloudera</a> develops and sells software products that help businesses process and analyze any amount of data using Apache Hadoop.  The closest competitor is <a href="http://hortonworks.com/">Hortonworks</a> , which entered the IPO at the end of 2014, showing a good rise in the value of shares at the start of trading, but reached a plateau by the current moment, which explains Cloudera's reluctance to repeat this experience. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/286838/">https://habr.com/ru/post/286838/</a></p>
