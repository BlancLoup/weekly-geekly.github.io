  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How to connect the online store to the payment system? The history of one company</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  One year - for so long we connected the online store and the <a href="http://service.kidsreview.ru/">online ticket booking</a> service <a href="http://service.kidsreview.ru/">for children's and family events</a> to the electronic payment system.  The post will not be about how to choose a gateway, bank or technically build a store, but about some of the pitfalls of the connection process. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Our product is complex, the banks do not understand it at all - there is no warehouse, there is no product and there were no sales that could be used to predict future turnover.  All the more naive now it seems to be our own surprise when the bank for the first time refused us Internet acquiring. <br><br>  <a href="http://www.banki.ru/wikibank/internet-ekvayring/">Only a few banks in Russia</a> provide this service and they are very suspicious - an individual entrepreneur or an LLC without a real office and staff is unlikely to have a chance for banks to like it.  In this case, the initial check with Assist or PayOnline can be successfully passed, the responsible manager at the bank will be friendly and nice, but the bank‚Äôs security service will say its firm ‚Äúno‚Äù, and that the most offensive is without explanation.

    <h5>  Internet acquiring needs an office to connect </h5><br>  We fought vainly against the wall: once again they reworked our wet shop without real testing, rewrote the offer and redrawed the agency agreement with partners, until one wise lawyer friend said - ‚Äúuntil you have a real office - Internet acquiring will not be given to you‚Äù. <br><br>  Polite, but Assista‚Äôs silence in response to our failures with banks (we need to conclude a trilateral agreement: Internet Acquiring Bank - Assist - your company) pushed us to the decision to try to build relationships with PayOnline, whose website allowed us to hope for greater interest in such a small business. companies like ours. <br><br><h5>  Payment gateway managers do not like to delve into particular </h5><br>  PayOnline manager found it difficult to understand our features.  They explained to us that a connected domain can only be of the second level, and not of the third,  shop.domain.ru - will not connect anymore.  Although ultimately, it was possible to circumvent this rule.  The manager wanted to see our current turnover and signed contracts with suppliers, and since we were only going to start selling someone else's tickets, we didn‚Äôt have any turnover or signed contracts.  The manager wanted to see a clear policy of returning money to customers and he doesn‚Äôt care that, according to the law, theaters have the right to don‚Äôt return money for purchased tickets. <br><br>  We wrote long explanatory notes to PayOnline with a request to help sort out a nonstandard situation, the answer to which was silence.  Then we called PayOnline and asked our questions again to get all the same general answers again.  The situation was saved by a letter to the representative of the company PayOnline on Habr√© - with a brief slander and crying for help.  It worked.  Our manager did read the explanatory notes, the situation got off the ground. <br><br><h5>  Testing the system: be careful, orders still pass! </h5><br>  When both PayOnline and Bank TransCreditBank were ready to go to the final stage of connecting our store to testing, they ordered us to roll out the tested store to a <a href="http://www.kidsreview.ru/">combat website</a> with attendance of about 10,000 unique visitors per day.  We were scared, we were worried that some readers would try to make a purchase, despite the announcements and warnings.  As a result of testing, we were hooked up (!) With the only proviso that within 10 days we must launch a real trade - enter into contracts, place tickets, start selling them. <br><br>  We had time, we placed real tickets, but after 10 days our store was unexpectedly and without any warning transferred back from combat mode to test mode.  The reason is that our commission for the online booking service, which was added to the ticket price, is already in the basket.  The arrows on the ‚Äúbig brother‚Äù Kassir.ru, with a commission of 10% in the basket - did not help. <br><br>  While we were deciding what to do, one of our readers did register and bought a ticket at the store that had been removed from combat mode.  In the information system of the seller on PayOnline, the last payment was listed as ‚Äúpending‚Äù - in processing, and the buyer received the cherished code by email and managed to attend the paid event with his child.  However, after a week, PayOnline did confirm that the money was not written off from the buyer's account, since the store was in test mode. <br><br>  We decided that 600 rubles is an inexpensive price for the acquired experience: the testing mode of the store with PayOnline is no different from the combat one.  And yet our store works!  We are glad that PayOnline connected us :) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/72d/c22/3e9/72dc223e97032903bbb3634075623b03.png" alt="image"><br><br><h5>  Registration: user preferences </h5><br>  2 months have passed since the full connection of our store, sales are gradually increasing, quick registration via Facebook loses the popularity of quick registration via Vkontakte and both lose to traditional registration via email and password.  Through our own <a href="http://vk.com/wall-19260618_4247">audience polls,</a> we found that about 34% of parents in St. Petersburg buy tickets via the Internet, about 57% "have not tried yet" and 9% - "fundamentally not."  Many people register, go all the way to go to the site of the payment system and leave.  We continue to work on the issue of trust and transparency of the whole process for buyers. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/158357/">https://habr.com/ru/post/158357/</a></p>
