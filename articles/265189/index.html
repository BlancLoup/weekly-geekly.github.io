  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Dell and TLC 3D NAND: Something New</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Dell is constantly moving forward and improving storage technology.  The next round of development was the arrays of the SC line with industrial flash drives Mainstream Read-Intensive (RI).  This SSD is based on TLC 3D NAND three-level memory, designed to reduce storage costs and increase overall system performance.  Previously, this combination was simply impossible, but the technology is not in place. <br><br>  This is not our first steps towards optimizing and reducing customer costs.  In 2013, we launched multilevel hybrid arrays with a unique intelligent data distribution system on the market.  Then, in 2014, they released the cheapest arrays in the All-flash segment.  At the same time (including due to such moves) sales of Dell flash and hybrid arrays are constantly growing - in the first quarter of 2015 of this year they increased by 89% when compared with the same period last year.  This year we want to change the approach of the market to industrial data warehouses, because new technologies have already made a reality of arrays based entirely on flash drives.  A reality quite accessible to customers. <br><br>  Here you need to make a small digression.  What does this type of memory do in general and what can its use in Dell arrays give? <a name="habracut"></a>  To begin with, in SSD based on TLC 3D NAND, the data recording density is significantly increased (up to 6 times) and the total capacity per 1U rack can reach 45 TB.  This is two times more than in previous-generation arrays.  At the same time, the cost of 1 GB of capacity is reduced almost to the level of a regular hard disk with a rotation speed of 15,000 rpm, and the performance becomes higher.  Much higher - in terms of performance, the All-flash array overtakes the system from conventional hard drives almost 24 times.  In addition, drive power consumption and cost are reduced.  Usually it was the high cost that prevented the distribution of arrays based on flash drives, but in the new generation of Dell storage systems, 1 GB of capacity will cost the client approximately 1.5 euro or 53 euro in a hybrid configuration.  At market prices, this is not much at all.  Back in 2013, Dell brought the total cost of the hybrid array to the value of an array of regular hard drives.  It's time to make every flash drive in the system as accessible.

      <br>
      The second major advantage of Dell systems is the freedom to combine.  If a modern data center needs a VERY high speed of working with data, instead of fast Mainstream RI, they install VERY fast and reliable Write-Intensive drives - they bypass RI by parameters.  Bypass, but costing much more expensive, so that the total cost of the array jumps up sharply.  And to reduce it without loss is almost impossible - of course, if we are not talking about Dell arrays.  Thanks to the patented intelligent data placement system, we can produce multi-level arrays that use different types of drives for different purposes.  To work with large volumes of write operations, it is enough to install several WI carriers that form the first storage level to simultaneously ensure high write performance and protection against frequent rewriting of MLC and TLC class media at the next storage level ... Thus, the load on RI drives decreases their life cycle is increasing, and the client‚Äôs budget does not burst at the seams.  Regarding the life cycle, there is one more pleasant moment: for customers with an extended ProSupport or Copilot corporate guarantee, we give a lifetime warranty on all the drives in the array.  In case of wear, they are easily replaced with new ones. <br><br>  The ability to combine different types of drives pulls another advantage: ease of scaling.  Suppose a customer has begun operations with a Dell single-level array, which consists entirely of mainstream RI drives.  If there is an urgent need to increase performance, it‚Äôs enough to add several WI drives to the rack, and not to buy a new single-level array.  And if most of the data in the array is ‚Äúcold,‚Äù then you can create a level from inexpensive hard drives that do an excellent job with storing such information.  It all depends on the needs of the client at this particular moment.  In addition, it allows you to keep up with technology and replace obsolete items not with one financially unbearable breakthrough, but gradually. <br><br>  And in the same way, gradually we bring the market to the idea that technologies for the corporate segment can and should be available.  We have ideas and plans for the next year, it is too early to tell in detail about them, but now we are already taking some steps.  Support for drives with TLC 3D NAND will appear in the arrays of the SC line in the very near future.  We continue to introduce new functions, increase the performance of arrays and the efficiency of data compression (even the possibility of introducing free data deduplication for customers is being considered), as well as reducing the cost of their storage.  And we do not plan to stop. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/265189/">https://habr.com/ru/post/265189/</a></p>
