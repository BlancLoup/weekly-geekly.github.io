Let's not talk about the fact that the client and the employee must be chosen wisely, the best of the existing couple of hundred offers;  that it is necessary to obtain a doctorate in psychology in order to reveal the ‚Äúscammer‚Äù at the negotiation stage;  that it is necessary to send a trimmed idle demo version with built-in backdoors;  that one should strictly stand on the principle of ‚Äúmorning chairs, evening money‚Äù - this has often been sucked in posts and comments.  Let's talk better about what will make your life boring, bland and tasteless, solving this problem in the bud - about escrow services. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h1>  What is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escrow">Escrow</a> ? </h1><br>  For us (customers and developers) it is important that escrow is such a thing that will allow: <br><ul><li>  in the case of the disappearance of the customer (auntie‚Äôs disease; acute absence of the Internet, time and willingness to pay; alien invasion of the native city), still get money; <br>  in the event of a worker‚Äôs disappearance (uncle's untimely death; acute lack of Internet, time and desire to work; alien abduction), after all, don‚Äôt lose money.

    <br>  The system works in "normal mode" is very simple: <br><ol><li>  The customer (B) and the developer (R) agree on the conditions (TK) and the amount ($$$); <br>  (TK) and ($$$) are transferred to the intermediary (E); <br>  (P) performs work and transfers it to (E) and (3); <br>  (3) happy and unlocking ($$$); <br>  (P) receives ($$$) and is also satisfied. <br><br><br>  In the case of untimely loss of (Z) or (P), the process becomes somewhat more complicated and looks like this: <br><ol><li>  The customer (B) and the developer (R) agree on the conditions (TK) and the amount ($$$); <br>  (TK) and ($$$) are transferred to the intermediary (E); <br>  (3) disappears; <br>  (P) performs work and transfers it (E); <br>  (E) checks the compliance of work (TK) and unlocks ($$$); <br>  (P) satisfied, because it receives ($$$). <br><br>  ... or so: <br><ol><li>  The customer (B) and the developer (R) agree on the conditions (TK) and the amount ($$$); <br>  (TK) and ($$$) are transferred to the intermediary (E); <br>  (P) disappears; <br>  (3) refers to (E); <br>  (E) unlocks ($$$); <br>  (3) is experiencing ambivalent feelings, since, on the one hand, the work is not done, but the money is not lost. <br><br><br>  <font color="red">Attention: even if escrow is used, you can make your life turbulent and interesting without reading the terms of reference, using the service rules or setting the wrong dates!</font> <br><br><h1>  Where to get it? </h1><br>  Almost all self-respecting freelance exchanges provide escrow-services.  Yes, Russian too - only to find this service is a bit more difficult, due to the lack of an established term (for example, on free-lance.ru this is called ‚ÄúDeal without risk‚Äù).  Usually it is not free;  decide for yourself what is more important for you: pay a small amount (sometimes a fixed amount, sometimes a percentage of the transaction) to an intermediary or have the opportunity to join the brethren of the cast and talk about it for many years with anguish. <br><br>  If everything is completely bad, and the exchange for which you have found a client does not provide this service - all is not lost, you can find an independent ecrow-service on the network. ... however, this is a topic for another conversation ... <br><br><h1>  Personal impressions </h1><br>  ... positive.  During the four years of working with rentacoder.com as a developer, I had to use their arbitration 4 times (three times - to withdraw money, one - alas, to give) - there were no complaints about the quality and speed of the service. </li></ol></li></ol></li></ol></li></ul></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/27372/">https://habr.com/ru/post/27372/</a></p>
