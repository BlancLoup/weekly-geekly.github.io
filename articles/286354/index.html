The cost of education in the United States and in Europe is different.  You do not have to be poisoned to study in countries where education and living are expensive.  In countries such as Germany and Norway, higher education in public universities is free.  In addition, students can finance their studies through scholarships and grants, which are now abound.

      For example, the Russian program <a href="http://educationglobal.ru/">‚ÄúGlobal Education‚Äù</a> - funding students who independently enrolled at leading universities in the world.  The program covers not only tuition, but all additional expenses (accommodation, study materials, travel). <br><br>  Or <a href="http://fulbright.ru/ru/russians/vgs">Fulbright</a> - a grant program for graduate studies in the United States for 1-2 years.  Funded entirely by the US Gos.  Department and aims to strengthen international relations with the Russian Federation.  The competition is held in three rounds: application, interview and delivery of <a href="http://toefl-test.ru/">TOEFL</a> and <a href="http://magistrategy.ru/gre/o-gre/">GRE</a> in the format of computer testing.  Successful candidates receive a grant. <br><br>  More about scholarships and grants in our <a href="http://blog.mbaconsult.ru/blog/education/magistratura-za-rubezhom-granty-i-stipendialnye-programmy/">previous article</a> . <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0071c5">You must be fluent in a foreign language.</font> </h2><br>  It is necessary to know a foreign language, of course, but not necessarily at the carrier level.  Although a high level is undoubtedly a huge plus for you.  The level is slightly higher than the average, enough to start.  Practically in all universities there are courses for those students who need to pull up a foreign language.  And then you just will not have another way out, how to learn the language perfectly. <br><br>  However, in many universities, foreigners still need to know the language well.  In the package of documents for admission must be present a certificate confirming the knowledge of the language.  For example, certificates <a href="http://www.mbaconsult.ru/ru/Services_and_courses/Courses/ielts.php">IELTS</a> , <a href="http://magistrategy.ru/toefl/o-toefl/">TOEFL</a> , <a href="http://www.institutfrancais.ru/ru/moskva/izuchat-francuzskiy/sertifikaty/calendrier-sessions-delf/dalf-%25D0%25BA%25D1%2583%25D1%2580%25D1%2581%25D1%258B-%25D1%2584%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BD%25D1%2586%25D1%2583%25D0%25B7%25D1%2581%25D0%25BA%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B3%25D0%25BE-%25D1%258F%25D0%25B7%25D1%258B%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B0-kursy-francuzskogo-yazyka">DALF</a> , <a href="https://www.testdaf.de/">TestDaF</a> , etc. Some universities allow "internal" language testing. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0071c5">Foreign universities do not accept Russian diplomas</font> </h2><br>  The Russian diploma of higher education confirms, rather, that there is some kind of education.  Due to the difference in curriculum, it will be necessary to work out according to the program that is adopted in the country of the planned training.  The duration of the Pre-Masters program may take about a year.  On this course, students learn the necessary subjects for graduate studies and tighten the level of English.  However, this is not always the case; many Russian universities are known abroad and their graduates are admitted to the university without additional courses. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/6c8/e08/2eb/6c8e082eb834408989d52f0c3931e1d2.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h2>  <font color="#0071c5">You can not learn and work at the same time</font> </h2><br>  Can.  It all depends on the visa you receive upon entry.  If the visa allows you to work, feel free to look for work.  In some countries, a student visa does not allow work.  In the US, a student visa does not qualify for employment, while in Australia a student may work several hours a week.  In addition, you can try to find a job at the university.  Do not forget about remote work - you can get settled in Russia and work remotely abroad. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0071c5">Universities accept documents until the end of spring</font> </h2><br>  Application deadlines vary by university and program.  For example, in Germany, documents are accepted twice a year: from June to July 15 - for the winter semester, from December to January 15 - for the summer semester.  Universities and colleges in the UK accept documents until January 15.  Universities in Norway accept documents for the fall semester from foreign students until March 1.  In France, documents are accepted from December to March 31. <br><br>  Most importantly, you need to decide on the university and the magistracy as early as possible in order to have time to pass the necessary tests and correctly prepare all the documents for the deadline. <br><br>  Thus, if the university of dreams is selected, then be sure to submit to the program that interests you.  Be sure to study the educational system of the country where you plan to enroll, possible grants and scholarships, the university curriculum and everything you need for admission, visa and labor laws, as well as the rules relating to education. <br><br>  Good luck and good luck! <br><br>  In our <a href="http://blog.mbaconsult.ru/blog/education/magistratura-v-anglii/%3Fsphrase_id%3D22575">next article</a> we will talk about the magistracy in England. <br><br>  The author of the article is Vyacheslav Davidenko, founder of <a href="http://www.mbaconsult.ru/">MBA Consult</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/286354/">https://habr.com/ru/post/286354/</a></p>
