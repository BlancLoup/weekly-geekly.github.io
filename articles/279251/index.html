Or new all-weather routers and switches Ubiquiti</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/2b5/5f3/84d/2b55f384da84414bb330a6161fde09fd.jpg"><br>  <a href="http://comptek.ru/catalog/ubiquiti/1JI3">Ubiquiti</a> all-weather <a href="http://comptek.ru/catalog/ubiquiti/1JI3">wireless solutions</a> , despite a considerable number of competitors, continue to enjoy steady demand, since Ubiquiti offers new, productive and technically interesting solutions all the time. <br>  However, until recently, operators faced the problem of locating the switching equipment of the base station, namely, switches, media converters, power injectors. <br>  Recently, ubiquiti proposed an original solution to this problem: a series of all-weather EdgePoint routers and switches with optical ports and Poe-Out, which we will consider today. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Finding and renting server rooms for indoor units is a rather unpleasant task. <br>  Firstly, such premises are not available everywhere at all, and secondly, it is very illogical to pay money for the rental of premises and place only a couple of switches there. <br>  A partial solution to the problem is the use of thermostated containers. <br>  However, the cost of a weather-proof container can be comparable to the cost of all the equipment it contains, if you remember the prices of ubiquiti solutions. <br>  And the size and weight of a typical thermal container somewhat limits the possibility of its installation on light mast structures. <br>  But now we have an alternative: EdgePoint routers and switches in all-weather performance. <br>  The ideology of the series EdgePoint - a complete rejection of the use of premises on the site. <br>  All that is needed to organize a communication center: a switch, a media converter, a power injector, is now in one small container, not exceeding the size of a 23 Db antenna (and for A4, sheet A4). <br>  At the same time, the capabilities of the new devices are quite serious: <br>  The first two models of EdgePoint are routers with sfp connectors, POE and OSPF routing functions, and the third is a powerful L3 switch with 10 Gbit SFP + slots. <br>  All devices can be powered as a separate dc input, and on a twisted pair and at the same time connect the poe of consumers (of course, Poe budget when connecting EdgePoint will be very limited). <br>  So, consider the EdgePoint models and their scope in more detail. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/1cf/f80/f12/1cff80f128784ef3912764e88f015ec5.jpg"><br>  The younger EP-R6 model is very similar to the <a href="http://comptek.ru/catalog/ubiquiti/2QBT">EdgeRouter X</a> : 5 Gigabit ports with Poe Out, though only in 24-volt mode, SFP slot, however, it claims a dual-core processor with hardware traffic processing, which puts it in line with the performance EdgeRouter poe. <br>  Functionally, the device is seen as a terminal node / repeater, a three four sector base station. <br>  The lack of support for 54 volts POE out makes it impossible to use it with airFiber 5 / 5u / 24. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d3f/9ab/8bd/d3f9ab8bdf384a7189557de3087c6d93.jpg"><br>  EP-R8 - weatherproof EdgeRouter Pro - 6 Gigabit ports, two SFP, hardware traffic processing unit. <br>  In addition to the increased, relatively younger model, the performance here appears to support Poe out 54 volts on two ports, which allows you to connect AirFiber 5 / 5U / 24 or motorized surveillance cameras, and 6 ports allow you to combine relay and 4 sector base station. <br>  Of the additional features - a niche for laying optical patch cords and a second Poe-in port, without the possibility of data transfer, which allows you to send more than 120 watts of power to the device via twisted pairs. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/243/df0/f37/243df0f37f1f49b78d220b51220227c9.jpg"><br>  EP-S16 - 16 port version of the EdgeSwitch.  Favorable difference from the router is the presence of 2 SFP + slots, which allows you to bring up to 20 Gbps to the device. <br>  A big plus of the device is 4 ports with increased Poe power. <br>  The remaining ports can power both 802.3af / at devices and 24 volt consumers. <br>  There is a niche for laying optical patch cords and the ability to mount on the body of picostation to control the device via Wi-Fi. <br>  A large number of ports and output power allows you to connect to the device not only multi-sector base stations, but also aggregated channels, for example, using AirFiber nxn. <br>  With a small Poe-budget of consumers, the device can be powered by two Poe in ports.

      In general, new solutions are very interesting. <br>  In fact, I would like to add to them perhaps an all-weather AC-DC unit for 120-200 watts and support for 4G modems for organizing Out-of-band base station control. <br>  Among the drawbacks is the temperature range from -20 degrees, however, the practice says that ubiquiti devices function stably at lower temperatures than stated. <br><br>  PS But the shape of the case of new products really looks like an inverted pear. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/279251/">https://habr.com/ru/post/279251/</a></p>
