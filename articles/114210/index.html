  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How is paid mail better than free mail?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  A person who is accustomed to some free service, as a rule, is quite difficult to explain why he should stop using it and switch to another, paid service.  Especially if the benefits of a paid service are not so obvious.  Owners of online resources with free and premium services, startups, online monetizers and SaaS service providers solve this serious task every day. <br><br>  Faced with her work, we wondered what arguments could be made in favor of paid business mail and how to explain to small and medium-sized businesses, why it would be better for them to abandon the disparate business addresses on free mail and purchase business mail. <br><br>  Perhaps the arguments and arguments listed by us will help you (and us) to attract new customers, hold a presentation or training, and at least slightly promote business mail "to the people."  It is enough to break the mass stereotype, and there will be enough space on the market for everyone.

    <a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h4>  So, why is paid mail better than free mail? </h4><br><br>  Before the beginning of the narration, it is necessary to make a reservation that this is a business mail.  So in Microsoft they prefer to call Exchange hosted at the facilities of the supplier, which, in turn, already provides services to end users.  Sure, there are other platforms, somewhere better, but worse than Microsoft Exchange, but the fact that this is the most massive solution for mail is obvious. <br>  Here are the main benefits of business mail, in our opinion. <br><br>  <b>Own domain</b>  Any company, even if from two employees, wants to look solid and trustworthy in the eyes of its customers.  This image is seriously hampered by mail on free mail hosting such as Mail.Ru or Yandex, with all due respect to these services.  For personal correspondence, they fit perfectly.  For a worker, they are not suitable at all; below we give several arguments in favor of this conclusion.  Accordingly, business mail on Hosted Exchange Server is easy to connect to an existing or new domain, and mail to clients will come from a domain name that matches the company name, trademark, or other identifier unique to you and no one else. <br><br>  <b>Single interface.</b>  Most people use Microsoft products in their daily work, know their interface and consider it familiar.  In all more or less recent Microsoft applications, a single interface organization is maintained, with bookmarks and active-inactive elements on them.  In paid mail built on Exchange Server, the web interface is built on the same principle.  In addition, nothing prevents "screw" mail in the usual Outlook or any other mail client. <br><br>  <b>It is convenient to read from the phone.</b>  Most modern smartphones, including the iPhone, can work with business mail right out of the box, just typing the necessary passwords and turnout in the fields.  No need to install additional applications, the interface is familiar, everything looks almost like on a computer. <br><br>  <b>Common tasks, calendars and contacts.</b>  In terms of free systems, there is no such functionality, or it is separated by different services.  Google has similar integration, but transferring such mail to your domain costs money and, moreover, it is noticeably time consuming.  Tasks and calendars are correctly linked in business e-mail, and, if synchronization with a mobile device is configured, meetings, for example, automatically get into the phone‚Äôs ‚Äúregular‚Äù calendar directly from the email client. <br><br>  And, finally, the main trump card.  <b>Advanced customization options.</b>  On free external mail there are simply no opportunities important for work in the company.  More precisely, a specially appointed person cannot manage all the boxes (at least, without the application of titanic efforts, such as collecting all the passwords and attempts to link Mail.Ru, Yandex and Google together with less popular services together).  With regular business e-mail, you can set up mailing lists, filter emails from unwanted addresses and to unwanted addresses, adjust changes and delete.  Practically in any company there may be conflict situations or even those requiring the intervention of the relevant authorities of the situation.  In this case, correspondence can be viewed and act as a source of both defense and attack.  Letters are not so easy to remove after the fact, for example, to hide something. <br><br>  Perhaps soon there will be new arguments in favor of paid business mail compared to free.  Then we will write another post. <br><br>  Finally <b>disclaimer</b> .  Yes, we sell business mail services, as well as many other providers.  And in their capabilities, mail built on the Exchange Server is the same for everyone.  The difference lies in the technological platform on which everything is implemented, and the level of service.  We will write about this too, but a little later.  Now we are talking about business mail in general, not necessarily ours. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/114210/">https://habr.com/ru/post/114210/</a></p>
