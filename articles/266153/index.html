  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How many installations are needed for the TOP App Store</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Most recently, I already wrote about how <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/sandbox/96393/">much you need to get downloads for the TOP-10 free games of the App Store</a> .  Today I want to continue this topic and talk about more significant milestones in the ratings of the online store from Apple, as well as how many organic installations can be obtained from the highest positions.  I really didn‚Äôt manage to raise the total TOP to the first place, but I was very close to this, and only Viber prevented me from doing so.  In general, it was like this: <br><br>  On August 31st, the release of my 1-2-3-4 Premium game was scheduled.  In the Russian App Store, it became visible a day earlier at 21:00 Moscow time, and an active PR campaign began immediately.  I managed to get into the TOP-10 games by 14:00, and for this, like last time, I needed about 6000 downloads, which, however, this time managed to be done in less than a day, spending about $ 500. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/36a/303/5b2/36a3035b290b450b983ca53a3dfc1ccd.png"></div><a name="habracut"></a>

        </script>
      <br>
      Here I drew attention to the fact that such top games as Angry Birds 2 and PAC-MAN from the creators of Crossy Roads in the general top are falling, and other top games are not at all visible, I decided to continue the active advertising campaign and by the evening I went up to 3 e place in the games and the 15th in total TOP.  For this, it took me about 12 thousand downloads per day, the cost of which amounted to about $ 1000. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/545/1cd/4b6/5451cd4b6a814cc887e6c39f3fdf1fee.png"></div><br><br>  Actually, about such a task stood before me.  But the appetite, as they say, comes with eating.  And, having found that already quite close to the leader in the games Happy Wheels, and that he also began to lose his position in the overdover, I again decided not to stop the campaign and by 3:00 pm on September 1 I took the first place in the games and the 7th overall rating with very minimal additional costs, originally not included in my plan.  And the number of downloads at this point close to 20 thousand. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ec1/996/f94/ec1996f94c264643a346526344580986.png"></div><br><br>  Here, perhaps it's time to talk about organic.  Moreover, at this moment I decided to stop advertising and watch what happens next.  Alas, but organic installations turned out to be less than we would like.  In the daytime I received about 450 new users per hour, in the evening about a hundred more.  This is clearly seen on the graph below, one has only to take into account that the time on it is given in GMT, that is, 3 hours less than Moscow time. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c1e/296/d0c/c1e296d0c96345419f0630ea9e7260bb.png"></div><br><br>  The stop of the PR campaign affected very quickly.  At 23:00 I was again overtaken by Happy Wheels, and in general TOP I rolled back to 10th place.  immediately the thought of revenge came to mind, and after carefully looking at the overall TOP and not only about it.  The fact is that at that time the first 2 places and for a rather long time were occupied by a couple of applications for Instagram and VKontakte.  Of course, I could not predict the number of their installations, as well as the presence or absence of advertising campaigns.  But then Sberbank, Votsupp, VC and Viber were going - that is, those applications that almost everyone who needs them has.  I do not think that they get too many new installations a day.  Rather, their high positions in the ranking are explained by the large number of downloads of all time, which undoubtedly also has considerable weight in the formation of ratings.  In general, I decided not only to continue the PR campaign, but also to significantly strengthen it with careful thoughts about TOP-3.  The situation seemed too favorable to me. <br><br>  And the plan worked.  On September 2, at 16; 30, I went to the 5th place in the overale, again returning to myself the first in games.  At the same time, Sberbank became the new overall ranking leader.  I again strengthened the advertisement already thinking about the first place in the overdraft.  Alas, then I did not know that at the same time another event happened.  A massive newsletter advertising its free game, apparently across the entire base of its users, began a vibe.  At 19:30 I saw my game on the 3rd place, and on the first one I saw a game from a vibe.  Then I realized that a poker player can feel with two aces on his hands, who got a ready straight from an opponent on the flop (I saw something like a rally, and 2 aces came to a Russian).  Well, at 21:30 I still overtook Sberbank, but since it was not enough for anyone to manage with several tens of millions of Viber users, I decided to stop spending money, which amounted to almost 2,000 dollars.  By this time, I had about 36 thousand new users in 3 days.  And if not vibe, it would give the first place. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/2e6/892/99b/2e689299b0224ed9927e3290e66910aa.png"></div><br><br>  Well, again about organic.  On the graph below, it is worth paying attention to the number of new users, starting at 17:00 (20:00 Moscow time), when the game was in second place in games and 2nd in the over coverage and no advertising was going on. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f10/3ea/a92/f103eaa924304bb9aefa0df6a365607c.png"></div><br><br>  The next day, in the evening, the game flew out of the TOP-10 overclocked, and in free games for the iPhone dropped to 3rd place.  Organic installations came 6700, and that's how they were distributed on the clock. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b99/a2d/79c/b99a2d79c8c04fc7a700cf897ac42e77.png"></div><br><br>  Of course, the number of installs required for a particular position in the ranking depends strongly on the current situation, and organic installations depend on the application.  Nevertheless, I hope that the statistics presented here will be useful to many people when promoting their products on the App Store. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/266153/">https://habr.com/ru/post/266153/</a></p>
