This year, the corporation created the satellite communications operator O3b Networks, which will begin to provide communication services in 2013.  The development of the company was allocated $ 1.2 billion, and the main direction of work of O3b Networks is the provision of satellite Internet communications in developing countries.  This company, by the way, was created back in 2008, even money was allocated, and a lot of money, for the development of the project, but the crisis prevented it from starting work, and the target activity started just now.  Let us hope that this time nothing will prevent this project - all the more so as we have received, as mentioned above, quite significant investments. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>  Currently, work is underway to create the necessary communications satellites, eight of which will be launched in the first half of 2013.  According to the plan, these satellites will ensure reliable communication between the stations of mobile operators in developing countries.  The satellites from O3b Networks will work as a bridge between the mobile operators of developing countries, providing a reliable signal level.  Regions in which O3b Networks is going to work have a very weak network infrastructure at the moment.

      It is worth noting that in addition to Google, such companies as SES, Liberty Global and HSBC are involved in the work on the project.  SES is currently the largest company in the market of satellite commercial services.  Thales Alenia Space will create satellites for the project. <br><br>  The project has several stages.  Thus, the first phase of the project includes the launch of satellite communications for those countries in Africa and Asia that are along the equatorial line.  “Internet access is very difficult here.  Firstly, there is no access to the main Internet backbones, and secondly, there are no serious investments in the creation of wired infrastructure.  O3b will bring multi-gigabit Internet to these markets, and it is completely unimportant whether the country is in the center of the continent or this small island nation, ” <a href="http://cybersecurity.ru/telecommunication/109111.html">commented</a> Greg Wheeler, one of the founders of O3b. <br><br>  The second stage is working with local telecommunications companies, which will be leased communication channels provided by satellites.  It is worth noting that in some regions where O3b Networks will operate, there is no Network at all.  The total number of countries with which O3b Networks will work is 150 countries, these are countries in Africa, Asia, Latin America and the Middle East.  It seems that Google, and not the governments of technically underdeveloped countries, so to speak, will be able to include such countries in the infrastructure of the global Internet. <br><br>  Via <a href="http://www.globaltelecomsbusiness.com/Article/2722458/Regions/25185/Google-satellite-service-gets-12bn.html">globaltelecomsbusiness</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/109009/">https://habr.com/ru/post/109009/</a></p>
