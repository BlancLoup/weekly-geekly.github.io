All those involved with the holiday!  Fighters serving in the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation - the inevitable demob.  And for those who have not served or are only going to repay a debt to the Motherland, under the cut is a curious story about smart hardware.  It is not excluded, if you are fumbling in technology, computers and software, you will be lucky not only to be knocked off at the headquarters by a clerk, but also to touch something from the one described below.  Well, I hope that I will not be raked for disclosing all state secrets there. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d5d/a2a/208/d5da2a208f354f9ebc93767f7af2f027.png">

      <br>
      Let's start with the main news of 2017: the <a href="http://www.kommersant.ru/doc/3227063">cyber</a> armies are officially <a href="http://www.kommersant.ru/doc/3227063">created</a> in the Russian army.  Please do not confuse with the sofa forces, although it is possible that the equipment for some will be at the expense of others.  So, in the event of an armed conflict, Russia must be prepared for the fact that its troop command and control system may be endangered and incapacitated.  The fighters of the invisible front must therefore be saved from this overseas sickness.  If you believe the media, the <a href="http://www.vesti.ru/doc.html%3Fid%3D2858596">number of Russian kibervoisk</a> numbers today about 1,000 people.  Their funding may be annually about 300 million rubles.  Well, i.e.  the maintenance of one fighter costs an average of about 300 thousand rubles a month.  Not bad.  For example, the salary of an ordinary Russian Armed Forces is <a href="http://www.armiya-priziv.ru/index/sluzhba-v-armii/zarplata-v-armii">about 8-11 thousand rubles</a> . <br><br><h3>  <font color="#cc0000">Unmanned tank "Nerekhta"</font> </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/8e0/d3f/1e6/8e0d3f1e6c10445bb6e509592c101571.jpg"><br><br>  If you were ‚Äúin civilian life‚Äù in WoT, War Thunder and other ‚Äútanchiki‚Äù in the army, you will not be bored.  "Nerekhta" - the real unmanned tank.  Armed with 7.62 and 12.7 millimeter machine guns, it must also carry a new type of ammunition for solving problems in indirect visibility conditions.  Also, a robotic complex can fight with heavier and more protected targets.  This means that in addition to the ‚Äútanchiki‚Äù, you will most likely be able to practice playing a flight simulator. <br><br>  The combat robot will also receive a new automated control system that will allow it to independently monitor and personalize targets on the battlefield.  In addition, it will be able to integrate with other complexes and unmanned vehicles, as well as in the process of "combat" to quickly connect various modules and systems that expand the functions of an unmanned platform.  In the Advanced Research Fund of the Russian Federation, they promise to make a real military Android out of this system. <br><br>  ‚ÄúThe <i>modular architecture of this system allows for the development and operation of unmanned systems to easily change and expand their configuration: integrate objects into a single network, add functionality, duplicate necessary blocks to increase resiliency, integrate the required type of payload</i> ,‚Äù the <b>FPI press service specified</b> . <br><br>  By the way, if you sawed or sawed software for remote access, you really need the Defense Ministry of the Russian Federation.  Now the developers are working on voice, gesture control of this combat robot.  Let's hope that it will be something more advanced than the joysticks from the ZX Spectrum. <br><br><h3>  <font color="#cc0000">"Pass-1"</font> </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/099/6a6/1d5/0996a61d59e34c2b9bea133faad79a48.jpg"><br><br>  If, in the distant Soviet childhood, you were hitting the Tetris, the Sapper or the Bolder for the ZX Spectrum, the next smart piece of paper will relieve the burden and deprivation of your military service.  Meet the ‚ÄúPass-1‚Äù robotic demining complex.  The name is controversial, of course, but you can't throw the words out of the song.  Thank God, they did not call ‚ÄúRazryshka‚Äù or ‚ÄúRazminyaka‚Äù, in the manner of the symbol of the forthcoming World Cup 2018 with the wolf ‚ÄúZabivaka‚Äù. <br><br>  The new robot sapper is based on the BRM-3MA armored clearance vehicle.  That, in turn, is designed on the basis of the T-90 tank with a 1000-horsepower engine and enhanced mine protection.  The front of the hull and deckhouse are covered with dynamic protection containers.  The BRM-3MA pushes in front of itself a trawl with rollers, cutters and jammers for radio-controlled land mines.  Armed with BRM 12.7-mm machine gun and eight grenade launchers for smoke screens. <br><br>  The most amazing thing is that people can sit in this thing.  The crew is two people, in the back of the cabin there is a troop compartment for three sappers.  The question immediately arises - is it generally humane?  Although, what kind of humanism in the army, the right word.  "There is a word necessary, and another concept order!". <br><br><h3>  <font color="#cc0000">Herbarium Project</font> </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/242/e74/f8d/242e74f8d8054a78a1ac74e2ff9e47cb.jpg"><br><br>  This is a real bomb.  Imagine that Steve Jobs and Sergey Brin were barred into the Russian army and asked to "file down" Google Play or the AppStore for the military.  How do you?  Have the task of beard and curls excited?  If so, drop everything and blow on the call station.  In the military enlistment office you can immediately say that you are behind the Herbarium.  The military are people who are stranded, they will understand everything and determine where they need to be.  Well, so as not to get lost, you can refer to <a href="https://rg.ru/2016/07/19/sekretnaia-boevaia-tehnika-vpervye-proshla-ispytanie-uchebnym-boem.html">Andrei Grigoriev,</a> head of the Foundation for Advanced Studies: <br><br>  - The <i>herbarium is a unified management environment, which is intended for the collective creation of engineering software and is intended to replace foreign software in Russia.</i>  <i>Domestic analogue of such a platform are google.play or apple.store, where developers spread the application, and the user downloads, uses, and issues comments.</i>  <i>In our case, the developer can be an organization, university, or individual.</i>  <i>They must upload their software product to the system, and if it passes a fixed set of tests, it enters the database, where it becomes available to all users on a commercial basis.</i>  <i>As a result, it will be possible to unite many developers of software modules both in Russia and, possibly, in the world, and also to set a common quality bar</i> . <br><br><h3>  <font color="#cc0000">T-50</font> </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/9d5/ee0/7db/9d5ee07dbff34f2a949e7dc2501a1c12.png"><br><br>  Here it is clear that it is dark.  The military promise the aircraft of the 6th generation in the region of 2025.  In the meantime, the 5th generation <a href="http://fb.ru/article/158341/istrebitel-pokoleniya-reaktivnyiy-istrebitel-foto-i-tehnicheskie-harakteristiki">T-50</a> aircraft is being finished.  It is worth noting that they have been doing this since 2010.  At the moment, there are six such machines in the bins.  It is possible that when it comes to the state defense order, the plane will jump over one generation.  Why not?  Remember how some in school jumped from the 4th to 6th right away? <br><br>  Among other Pribluda Russian designers can start creating a promising machine both on an unmanned basis and on the basis of technologies involving participation in the management of a person‚Äôs aircraft.  In open sources, data on the tasks of the 6th generation aircraft are few.  Among other things, <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A1%25D1%2582%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BB%25D1%2581-%25D1%2582%25D0%25B5%25D1%2585%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BB%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B3%25D0%25B8%25D1%258F">stealth</a> technology and more.  But it is obvious that the demand for import substitution and domestic software in the Defense Ministry of the Russian Federation will only increase.  So, bearded hipster programmer, your brain is needed by the armed forces 24/7 - 365 days a year. <br><br><h3>  <font color="#cc0000">"Uran-9"</font> </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/199/701/e84/199701e84fa541d59c2709e9492c97d6.png"><br><br>  <a href="https://rg.ru/2016/01/13/robot.html">Uranium-9</a> is a multifunctional robotic complex.  I wonder how are uranus-8 and uranium-7 doing and what are they doing downstream?  Well, God bless them.  The Uran-9 complex is intended for remote reconnaissance and fire support for the combined-arms, reconnaissance and anti-terrorist units.  It consists of two reconnaissance and fire support robots, a tractor for their transportation and a mobile control point. <br><br>  The armament of reconnaissance and fire support robots includes a 30 mm automatic 2A72 cannon and a 7.62 mm machine gun coupled with it, as well as Attack anti-tank guided missiles.  However, the composition of weapons may vary depending on customer requirements.  Uran-9 was designed using the latest technologies that significantly reduce the likelihood of a robot being detected by radar and optical surveillance systems.  It is also equipped with a warning system for laser irradiation. <br><br><h3>  <font color="#cc0000">Platform-M</font> </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/94a/aec/a27/94aaeca27bde4b35b8981ecc44f01132.png"><br><br>  If you stuck on NFS and other races, the good news for you is ‚Äú <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259F%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B0%25D1%2582%25D1%2584%25D0%25BE%25D1%2580%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B0-%25D0%259C">Platform M</a> ‚Äù.  The universal tracked robotic platform - ‚ÄúPlatform-M‚Äù has been waiting for you, and for a long time already.  It can carry a payload weighing up to 300 kg.  Its distinctive feature in the built modularity of the design.  Depending on the specific conditions of the combat situation, the same platform can be transformed into a carrier of anti-tank missile systems, automatic grenade launchers, machine guns of various calibers, as well as optical-electronic and radio intelligence systems.  It is also important that the reservation of the complex is made according to the third class of protection, which is not punched by 5.56 mm caliber bullets, which is the most massive caliber of NATO automatic small arms. <br><br><h3>  <font color="#cc0000">"Shooter"</font> </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f2e/2c7/635/f2e2c763548b4de4aec60bfc27612021.png"><br><br>  Robot complex "Shooter" is designed for the hottest areas of possible clashes.  In the basic configuration, it has two AGS-30 grenade launchers, two Bumblebee flame throwers, a Pecheneg heavy machine gun, and up to 10 smoke grenades. <br><br>  An interesting feature of the machine is that all the weapons that are installed on the Strelka, if necessary, can be removed and given to the fighter right during the battle and vice versa. <br><br><h3>  <font color="#cc0000">"Crossbow"</font> </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/3fa/c3c/d16/3fac3cd16fb440379c15fe9fb2c6a7fc.png"><br><br>  Combat remote control complex ( <a href="https://www.gazeta.ru/social/2015/09/10/7748387.shtml">robot machine gun</a> ).

Total and not list.  We can only say that civilian engineers and developers have a chance to try their luck in developing new types of equipment.  You can even poderenditsya on state defense orders.  In general, the Russian army has already used unique drones that can suppress cell towers.  These unmanned aerial vehicles can also send text and audio messages to subscribers.  In the Russian media they are called "cellular weapons." <br><br><h3>  <font color="#cc0000">"Blinding Laser"</font> </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ccd/cc2/68b/ccdcc268bd6b4c9590b98ac047fbf35a.jpg"><br><br>  According to media reports, the <a href="http://www.pravda-tv.ru/2017/02/23/284023/top-10-krutyh-razrabotok-dlya-rossijskoj-armii">Blinding Laser</a> is a mobile laser complex that blinds the optics of aircraft as well as rockets.  The operation of the complex is simple - the laser beam is directed at the detected optical system and blinds it.  The Ministry of Defense will receive in the near future. <br><br><h3>  <font color="#cc0000">"Military Internet"</font> </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/8ea/6e9/f85/8ea6e9f8539846f083ed174d4adf75a8.png"><br><br>  More recently, the <a href="http://www.rbc.ru/technology_and_media/07/04/2016/570664d09a79475afbf3710d">media reported</a> that units of the Russian armed forces experienced high-speed military Internet and communications systems of the latest generation during the antiterrorist operation in Syria.  In the SAR (Syrian Arab Republic), the work of a new ground-based communication technology was tested in a real combat operation.  They used, in particular, tactical complexes P-169 and P-380K.  These are digital tools using the latest generation of communications technology.  Well, you understand, yes?  If you are a system administrator and suddenly become sad at your workplace, and your favorite sweater has lost its original colors, drop everything and welcome to the military Internet administrators.  I also hope that on its base military social networks Odnovvvodniki, Dembel will be deployed soon, as well as the popular groups Perfume, Scoops and Grandfather will develop.  If you suddenly stuck on this topic, then <a href="http://sdelanounas.ru/blogs/22617">there</a> are a lot of different things. <br><br>  <b>ZY</b>  In conclusion, I want to believe that the weapon described above will remain cute toys in the hands of servicemen in field exercises.  I do not want to think that someday something like that will knock on my door.  Peace to the world! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e3a/60c/113/e3a60c11395846caade337adb01d18e4.png"></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/322468/">https://habr.com/ru/post/322468/</a></p>
