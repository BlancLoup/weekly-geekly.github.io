Interesting things</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><h1>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/1c_club/blog/265817/">To the previous part - Who and what he studied, daily routine, carrot and gingerbread</a> </h1><br><br><h1>  So interesting </h1><br>  Every day we come up with activity.  Conducting a summer school for 4 years in a row, we faced a shortage of places where schoolchildren could be reduced.  It became difficult, because there are always children who were already in past summer schools (i.e., it is undesirable to repeat), plus go and find those who are ready to invite 59 at once!  guests ... <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/1d4/dc9/78d/1d4dc978d4e73df76146d247f755a4b2.jpg" alt="image"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  We can always and will repeat with visits to universities.  For 2 summer schools we visited all the cool Moscow technical universities (in some cases - faculties).

      Most of all, of course, we like them at MEPhI, in many respects because the guys who hold meetings for us always have a responsible and careful approach to their tasks.  There has never been an uninteresting lecture or boring excursion.  For example, last year we were lucky to get to a lecture on cryptography, which was conducted for us by the Head of the Department No. 42 "Cryptology and Discrete Mathematics" Nikolai Dmitrievich Podufalov.  And this year we got acquainted with NEVOD and the methods of measuring muons and neurons.  We were shown pools for measurement (2 thousand tons in volume - this is how not to turn off the tap with water for a whole year) and the coordinate detector, which helps to track the coordinates of the beginning of the particle and its track.  We were also told about OURAGAN (Installation for Recognition of Thunderstorm Anomalies). <br><br>  We visited the laboratory of lasers and the Institute of Financial and Economic Security (IFEB) at MEPhI.  Students at this institute are studying areas such as anti-money laundering or countering the financing of terrorism.  The threshold for entry points varies in the range of 256-284, with the number of budget places from 10 to 20 depending on the faculty.  But paid tuition is expensive from 68 to 84 per semester, but they say that successful students receive tangible discounts on the basis of the sessions. <br><br>  We also, of course, visited MIPT.  About their projects we were told by students of the FIVT.  Not sure if we can discover the essence of the projects, perhaps this is a commercial secret, but they were mega cool.  And we "poyuzali" ski simulator with augmented reality. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/23b/f72/2fe/23bf722fedb0bea7e607e0a44cc33789.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Well, as without MSU, we also went there several times, for example, we got acquainted with the Lomonosov supercomputer. <br><br>  MIEM struck us with a robotics laboratory.  The students of this university and the robots with which they work, it turns out, are the winners and prize-winners of international championships.  And there is such a view as sumo robots. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ce3/4b7/078/ce34b70787f44fa2ca666889360a92d4.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Ivan Vladimirovich Arzhantsev, the dean of this new, progressive faculty, told us about the new faculty of Computer Science in the Higher School of Economics.  Nowadays the faculty is very popular among winners and prize-winners of computer science and programming competitions. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/cb5/432/109/cb54321094b0fdf4b15e71715d92b4d7.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  This year we tried a new kind of activity in the form of completing quests that are now in trend.  In the summer school '15 we took part in 2 quests.  One of them was organized for us by the largest subsidiary of 1C Company - 1C-Rarus.  The quest was called "Running Rarus, or Journey of the Yellow Box."  On the quest, the guys got acquainted with the procedures that are applied to software products, after they get to the warehouse of a partner or distributor. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/9a4/9b9/205/9a49b92059c3c1b760f7417fe0dd940e.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The second quest was entertaining; ExitGames prepared it for us.  The guys were delighted. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/587/063/1cb/5870631cbf83377ef74557f5873ce7b4.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Guests came to us.  For example, there was a lecture devoted to the prospects of neural interfaces from Vyacheslav Lebedev, who is an employee of the NeuroFuture research team.  In the fall, we will visit NeuroFuture where we were promised to give us the opportunity to use all the available gadgets, which, for example, allow us to blow up a barrel with our thoughts. <br><br>  Among other things, they were at the Chocolate Museum on Mayakovskaya, on an excursion to Moscow-City, at the Baskin-Robins plant, in the Planetarium, at the VDNKh Robotic Station, at the Ostankino TV Tower, and much more, including a visit from representatives from the Ministry of Communications. <br><img src="https://img-fotki.yandex.ru/get/9767/327168383.0/0_137e14_fcc0647f_orig" alt="image"><br><br>  There were also funny overlays, for example, on one site instead of 3d printers, we cut it out with jigsaws). <br><br><h1>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/1c_club/blog/266031/">To the next part - Protecting projects and distributing elephants</a> </h1></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/265985/">https://habr.com/ru/post/265985/</a></p>
