However, the standard leg did not allow this in view of the location of the computer desk relative to the place of rest. After reviewing various options for ready-made solutions, he concluded that in order to please all his wishes have to do everything yourself. <br><br>  And also ‚Äúwe kindly ask‚Äù the monitor to show in the maximum resolution via HDMI in spite of the manuals. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/684/511/de5/684511de591841a5b582346640bf2214.jpg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  R01i01 Iron - or rather, particleboard </h4><br>  Almost all solutions presented in stores are made of metal, which is cool and effective, but unfortunately I do not have the opportunity to process it at home.  The chipboard became a compromise solution - durable, affordable material, plus it goes well with furniture.  Master Alexander, who at that time made us a kitchen, agreed to assist in the manufacture of two parts according to a simple sketch, a start was made, we move on!

I chose the biggest ones with several bearings, which I did not attach to the collapsible values, as it turned out in vain - more on this later in the description of the second release. <br><br>  Thanks to the design of the native leg, it was possible to extract almost all the necessary mechanisms for regulation from it: <br><ul><li>  height (not completely) - temporarily fixed with a rope in the upper position, completion is planned </li><li>  tilt </li><li>  turning </li></ul><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Ported regulatory mechanisms</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d7a/898/7ad/d7a8987ada4d23f2b82f11fc5ba4e283.jpg"><br></div></div><br><br><h4>  R01i02 Electrics - wiring </h4><br>  Increasing the ‚Äúmonitor coverage‚Äù naturally required an extension of the cables. <br>  - Power cable - everything is simple, cut, soldered.  Lengthen the cable remaining from the apartment wiring 1.5 sq. Mm.  (white) <br>  - Signal cable - did not solder, I bought a 5m HDMI cable, as it turned out later was not a very good solution. <br>  Laying cables was not as trivial as I thought it took to probe all the positions of the monitor and the bracket to make sure that bending the cable would not interfere and their length would be enough, and you also need to remember that they should not break loosely on bends.  For fixing used narrow tape - cheap, fast and relatively effective. <br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Cable management</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/788/3c7/d6b/7883c7d6bfdcaff4deb78d3c941d84db.jpg"><br></div></div><br><br><h4>  R01i03 Soft - like a real programmer, fixing iron bugs with software </h4><br>  What was the disappointment when connecting through a new long HDMI cable I received the maximum resolution of only 1920x1080 ... <br><br>  The official position of the support service DELL: <br>  &gt;&gt;&gt; But I just wonder why HDMI on U2713HM does not support 2560x1440? <br>  DELL-Chris M: The $ 699.99 U2713HM has HDMI 1.3 (1920x1080).  The $ 999.99 U2713H has HDMI 1.4 (2560x1440). <br>  proof <a href="http://en.community.dell.com/support-forums/peripherals/f/3529/t/19483304.aspx">en.community.dell.com/support-forums/peripherals/f/3529/t/19483304.aspx</a> <br><br>  I sincerely do not understand why there is an interface in the monitor that does not support the resolution of the matrix! <br>  However, after playing with the resolution settings, the cherished 2560x1440 pixels were achieved, although the refresh rate was only 40 Hz. <br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Screenshot of settings for 2560x1440 @ 40</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/925/f4d/6d9/925f4d6d918ec58da5282937b8c02749.png"><br></div></div><br>  In principle, it can be said that this is the minimum relatively comfortable level, you can live, but still I plan to purchase a DVI Dual link 24pin 5m cable to raise to 60Hz. <br>  <i>Update: problem solved further in R03i01</i> <br><br><h4>  R01 testing Chef all went! </h4><br>  After the first release and short use, a most unpleasant bug emerged - since the loops rotate very easily, due to the slightest misalignment of the design, the monitor could not be kept in the right positions, and gradually self-balanced in its most comfortable position.  A temporary crutch in the literal and figurative sense of a cardboard box under the monitor. <br><br>  It was decided to correct the situation and monitor, on the nose of the second release. <br><br><h4>  R02i01 Yes, I twist you into a ram's horn! </h4><br>  Despite my hopes, the first bracket segment did not cope with the torsional load.  With the L-shaped position of the segments, there is a very noticeable movement of the monitor up and down and, as a result, the monitor sagging as a whole with respect to a perfectly rigid structure. <br>  The ‚Äúreal‚Äù lacquered chipboard from the USSR times helps us out; there was no time back from the bed and now tepericha - reinforcement of the first bracket segment.  I had to work hard to cut it with a hacksaw.  Drilled, missed glue, turned the screws - ready, rigidity restored! <br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Reinforced construction + final cable management</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a90/cc6/56e/a90cc656e99d12446d7e84aef43fa626.jpg"><br></div></div><br><br><h4>  R02i02 Loop loop </h4><br>  The hinges turned out to be with a slight but still play, which gave an even greater deviation from the ideal. <br>  We see the difference in the gaps of the upper and lower loops - this is because of the backlash: <br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Skew</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/463/0ef/044/4630ef044a7460de04a290b71386907d.jpg"><br></div></div><br>  We compensate for sagging and play with the help of the substrate under the lower loop - usual washers / substrates are difficult to regulate in thickness, so we resort to tricks - we screw in the screws and adjust them: <br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">We adjust almost like a door on the fridge</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/da4/341/583/da434158319ab10002dcbf395f6796cd.jpg"><br></div></div><br><br><h4>  R02i03 Plus - Minus </h4><br>  The main advantage of the hinges is easy to turn around, now plays against us, the monitor does not fix well in the selected position.  As previously mentioned, if the hinges were collapsible, something viscous could be poured in there, but alas ... <br>  The sample with sunflower oil did not produce results, it should have dried out and become viscous and sticky, but a month later the loops function easily and smoothly as before, apparently the lubricant from the plant prevented the idea. <br>  We receive a part from the furniture hinge to the rescue - we create something like a brake for the hinge, adjust the friction to an acceptable fixation: <br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Damping mechanism</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/eb9/b0c/82f/eb9b0c82f406d73aed52afae0301ab62.jpg"><br></div></div><br>  Initially it was a piece of rubber, but because of its softness, after turning, there was a slight return, replaced with a piece of wood, now after turning it is an exact fixation of the position. <br><br><h4>  R02 testing Plans for R03 </h4><br>  In general, everything turned out as expected, convenient, practical, the maximum possible size of the bracket. <br>  A lot of space was freed up under the monitor that was occupied by the leg: <br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Hooray!</b>  <b class="spoiler_title">Places for creative disorder has become even more!</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e7a/342/70f/e7a34270f0675f24235024b4949da9de.jpg"><br></div></div><br><br><h4>  Sandbox Update R03i01 The monitor is enlarged - maximum quality via HDMI cable! </h4><br>  While the article was waiting for its part in the sandbox, the third release solved the problem with the HDMI interface. <br>  As I wrote earlier, for the comfortable work it was planned to buy one more cable: DVI-DVI 5m Dual Link - $ 8 .. $ 10. <br>  While searching, choosing, came across such an adapter HDMI-DVI ~ $ 2, and the store was next. <br><br>  A wonderful miracle - a cheap adapter saves $ 300 ($ 699.99- $ 999.99 see above) <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/62b/bfd/5e3/62bbfd5e38bb4854a6524c0376698e84.jpg"><br>  Actually focus: connect the HDMI cable to the DVI interface of the monitor via an adapter, <br>  Namely, we ‚Äúbypass‚Äù the poor HDMI interface of the monitor, although de facto we take the signal from the video card from the HDMI port, and the cable is also HDMI. <br><br>  Profit in my case: no need to replace and re-lay the cable, spent only $ 2 on the adapter instead of as much as $ 10 on the cable. <br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Victory!</b>  <b class="spoiler_title">2560x1440 @ 65 via HDMI cable.</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/66f/c16/252/66fc162529b8689966b14f67a7ccb532.png"><br></div></div><br>  Please note: it was possible to raise to 65Hz versus the standard 60Hz - and that is good. <br><br><h4>  Results: </h4><br>  I liked it very much in use, there were no complaints, all the main problems were fixed, the main ugliness was hidden from the non-viewing side and behind the monitor. <br><br>  The plans are some little things: <br><ul><li>  glue the old chipboard part in the appropriate color. </li><li>  unlock the height adjustment - move the spring from the original leg or make an alternative solution. </li><li>  replace the HDMI cable to DVI-D.  <i>(Already decided in R03i01)</i> </li></ul><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Some more photos</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/936/a1b/cbc/936a1bcbcd18990e45f71df6fbd6d1ac.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/18b/0c3/749/18b0c37496026ac2eabdc5843690480f.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/8ad/b87/54b/8adb8754bc6e3f87a171125db66f12c3.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f1a/dbe/fa4/f1adbefa4519a09590bb1e6d3c66f1f7.jpg"><br></div></div><br>  At first, I couldn‚Äôt even imagine that it would all be so entertaining, I thought how I would twist a couple of wood with loops and was ready, but no, so you decide. <br><br>  I wish you all interesting initiatives and their creative solutions! <br><br><hr><a name="Update"></a><br>  Update: From comments I see interest on a couple of points. <br><br>  <b>1) Material</b> <blockquote>  The product is made of metal, it is cool and spectacular, but unfortunately I do <u>not have the opportunity to process it</u> at home.  <u>Compromise</u> decision was chipboard. <br></blockquote><br>  <b>2) A large lever, pull out the screws, chipboard will break</b> <br>  Yes, the lever is big, but the chipboard and screws are worthy: <br><ul><li>  on the stand at the very "root" the diameter of the rezka on some screws reaches 5-5.5 mm long 30 mm (in the depth of the chipboard) </li><li>  the rack and the first section of a double sheet of chipboard (16 + 16 = 32mm) the first section is reinforced with a super chipboard made in the USSR - it is very strong. </li><li>  Screw screws with great difficulty and creak - so they sit very, very tight. </li></ul><br>  <b>3) Collective farm</b> <br>  Yes, some knots were skolhozil from what was at hand, and honestly showed them in a close-up photo for technical reasons, but this does not mean that it sticks out in all directions and is not aesthetically pleasing. <br>  In general, as already mentioned, all the ugliness is hidden "behind the screen" and does not cause trouble. <br><br>  Well, in conclusion, the fact that it is relatively difficult to challenge: <br>  <b>For more than 2 months, normal flight</b> <b><br></b>  <b>screws are not loosened,</b> <b><br></b>  <b>the monitor does not swing and is quite tough.</b> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/221263/">https://habr.com/ru/post/221263/</a></p>
