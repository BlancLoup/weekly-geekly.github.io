      We are not looking for easy ways (just euro 84+, and dollar 76+) - we are looking for ways to achieve the goal.  If you want knowledge, let's get it now, why delay it? <br>  Are you sure you want to be a student again and not start working right now? <br>  And, to be honest, business schools will not disappear anywhere from you, but right now you can prepare and analyze how much you really need it. <br><br>  We have 6 disciplines that will help you understand where to go next. </h6><br><br><h5>  // Project Management </h5><br><h6>  One of the most sought-after professions in the business field, seriously - there are not so many good project managers.  And you don‚Äôt even have to become one - the skills you will gain in this course will help you to better and more efficiently allocate the time you spend on completing tasks. <br>  Try this course: <a href="https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-project-management-adelaidex-project101x">Introduction to project management, University of Adelaide</a> </h6><br><br><h5>  // Marketing </h5><br><h6>  Probably, there is no point in proving to you that knowledge and understanding of the basics of marketing in the 21st century is simply necessary.  The ability to work with the product, understanding the market, communication with the consumer, setting goals and finding trends - all this is not so easy, but since you decided to create something of your own, then this course is mandatory for listening.  All the more from Wharton. <br>  Check out here: <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/wharton-marketing/%3FsiteID%3DTnL5HPStwNw-GAgvCnWPu1p90QY8GGgnEw%26utm_content%3D10%26utm_medium%3Dpartners%26utm_source%3Dlinkshare%26utm_campaign%3DTnL5HPStwNw">Introduction to marketing, University of Pennsylvania</a> </h6><br><br>  <b>And we also created an <a href="http://icanchoose.ru/blog/antizanudnyj-proforientacionnyj-test/%3Futm_source%3Dvk.com%26utm_medium%3Dsocial%26utm_campaign%3Dproforientatsiya-vsegda-byla-skuchnoy-i%25C2%25A0odn">anti-boring professional orientation test</a> .</b>  <b>And he is really cool - more than 7,000 people have passed.</b> <br><br><br><h5>  // Finance </h5><br><h6>  If among all the MBA disciplines we were offered to choose one, then it would be finances.  Without an understanding of this area of ‚Äã‚Äãyour work, we are afraid you will not budge, especially now.  No matter how difficult the abbreviations that you see for the first time (ROI, NPV, IRR), do not despair, you will have the opportunity to show off knowledge. <br>  Here you can learn basic concepts: <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/course/corporate-finance-spring-2015/id959944936">Corporate finance, New York University</a> </h6><br><br><h5>  // Negotiation </h5><br><h6>  Negotiation skills will be useful to you in everyday life - buying a car, raising salaries, working with a client - life would be a little easier if everyone knew how to create mutually beneficial conditions and everyone would be happy.  Therefore, we suggest that you take one of the most popular courses of all times and peoples (and this is not a joke). <br>  He is here: <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/negotiation-skills/%3FsiteID%3DTnL5HPStwNw-GIbjUNVuhZKm6qLBSD5Nrw%26utm_content%3D10%26utm_medium%3Dpartners%26utm_source%3Dlinkshare%26utm_campaign%3DTnL5HPStwNw">Successful negotiation: Essential strategies and skills, University of Michigan</a> </h6><br><br><h5>  // Entrepreneurship </h5><br><h6>  Maybe you are a real careerist with a bunch of ambitions, or maybe just a shy guy who wants to start his own business. One way or another, you should be prepared to challenge every business idea and see which one can start working. make a profit, and what - kittens on the iPhone, which are funny wagging mustache. <br>  And in general, now in large companies in in-house there is the practice of creating the position of an ‚Äúentrepreneur‚Äù (something like that).  Take note. <br>  Good course here: <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/how-to-build-a-startup--ep245">How to build a startup</a> </h6><br><br><h5>  // Strategy </h5><br><h6>  In general, we wonder why there is no such subject in universities.  Some, of course, had a logic, but a strategy ‚Äî it could be very interesting.  This is the discipline that links all the above courses into what you will use in practice later.  This is an understanding of the sequence and logic of using tools, working out steps for developing an idea, for career growth, and so on.  Those who have a plan are always one step ahead regarding those who have no plan. <br>  Who is my competitor?  What opportunities do I have?  What is my strength? <br>  You can start building a strategy after this course: <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/foundations-business-strategy/home/info%3FsiteID%3DTnL5HPStwNw-dFGKosni.YJXQM3XXOiBdg%26utm_content%3D10%26utm_medium%3Dpartners%26utm_source%3Dlinkshare%26utm_campaign%3DTnL5HPStwNw">Foundations of business strategy, University of Virginia</a> <br></h6></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/300198/">https://habr.com/ru/post/300198/</a></p>
