      There is even a study that proves that the <strong>life of a procrastinator is shorter</strong> than the life of a person who does everything on time, because he prokrastirut even visits to doctors. <br><br>  There is no doubt that procrastination, and especially the fight against it, is a very hot topic for all of us.  The world in which we live is very complex and is developing very quickly, there is the Internet, social networks, letters, chat rooms and a huge number of various other distractions.  Therefore, the level of procrastination is greatly increased, and the skill of controlling it is most important in order to achieve success in your personal life. <br><br>  Under the cut, the story of <strong>Peter Ludwig</strong> at the <a href="http://conf.aletheia.business/">Aletheia Business 2017</a> conference on how to put an end to procrastination using three simple tools.  As soon as you embed them in your life, you will immediately notice the difference.  <strong>You will be more productive, you will feel happier and you will have more energy</strong> . <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/p3692PKRkZw" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <strong><em>About the speaker:</em></strong> Peter Ludwig has been working on the study of procrastination all his life, and for the last 10 years he has been actively seeking methods to combat it.  He wrote a book about it, which became a bestseller in 4 countries, translated into 7 languages ‚Äã‚Äãand is in great demand.  Which once again confirms how often people experience procrastination. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/pk/ob/xo/pkobxozuke3vaifpru8r7g6fjbi.png"><br><br>  Let's look at another example of procrastination.  Suppose you have a task that you need to perform, there are classes that you like and that you want to do, and what you actually do. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/8v/i2/ce/8vi2ceu7m0otdkal12_obbluuxy.png"><br><br>  You know that there are certain tasks that will change the world for the better, help you to become better yourself as individuals, but ... You are watching the next episode of ‚ÄúGame of Thrones‚Äù, watering the plants in the office or, for example, set off the alarm clock. <br><br>  If you do not wake up from the first alarm bell, this is also one of the procrastination formats. <br><br>  <strong>Let's start by not postponing the fight against procrastination!</strong> <br><br>  Albert Einstein once said: <br><blockquote>  <em>‚ÄúIf you cannot explain it simply, then you yourself do not understand it to the end.‚Äù</em> <br></blockquote>  I really like this quote because if you really want to understand something, you need to look for the most simple answer.  That is why I use the images here and in my book. <br><br>  What do you think when procrastination started in the history of mankind?  It happened much earlier than a few thousand years ago.  The philosopher Seneca once said: <br><blockquote><br>  <em>"As long as we put off life, it passes."</em> <br></blockquote>  This simple sentence explains why procrastination is not good: when we procrastinate, we spend our time.  From my point of view, <strong>time is the most valuable resource</strong> in our life.  It is impossible to occupy, save or increase.  Every minute spent on procrastination is spent forever. <br><br><h2>  Nowadays </h2><br>  As I said, we live in a unique time.  I have a few graphs that I would like to show you. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/tq/_0/1x/tq_01xx8jugyhe8nmyt0tecv_ia.png"><br><br>  The graph above shows the average life expectancy for the last 10,000 years.  Almost all this time, the average life expectancy was 25 years, but over the last hundred years it has increased by 2 times.  The reason for this growth lies mainly in the fact that the death rate among children has decreased, and vaccines have been found against the most dangerous and powerful viruses. <br><br>  Below is another interesting graph that shows the chances that you will be killed. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/r4/sn/95/r4sn95blf3lad0zll1q5b5i_gky.png"><br><br>  It shows that <strong>we live in the most peaceful time in history</strong> .  There are fewer wars on Earth than ever before, and the chance of being killed is minimal.  If you lived 100, 200, 300 or even 400 years ago, it would be 10 times higher. <br><br>  The growth of the development of science and technology in our time is taking place exponentially.  This is very noticeable on mobile phones, which are now more powerful than the coolest computer 20 years ago. <br><br>  Let's take a look at how technology has changed over the past 100 years. <br><br>  In 1903, we made our first flight. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/n5/dz/r8/n5dzr8xj-qvsdkvrazukbyy3alq.png"><br><br>  Only 60 years later we landed on the moon. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ri/ks/5q/riks5qvla3xm1vflbjglf0swlz8.png"><br><br>  A few years ago we sent our first rover to Mars. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ep/5p/rf/ep5prfrivnpmfo5ujz07iasidye.png"><br><br>  And, as you know, Ilon Mask says that in 5-10 years he wants to send there living people. <br><br>  Studies show that over the past 100 years, the level of success in the development of technology exceeds all that we have achieved in its entire history.  We are very lucky! <br><br>  But do you think people have become happier in our time than 100 years ago? <br><br>  Research shows that <strong>people</strong> are actually <strong>less and less happy</strong> .  There are reasons for this.  One of them is the complexity of our world. <br><br>  As I said, <strong>complexity is one of the most important friends of procrastination</strong> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/3c/6d/3x/3c6d3xjyhyhlz46mkwlimoqm8e4.png"><br><br>  This is the most terrible illustration of procrastination called ‚Äú <strong>Paralysis of choice</strong> ‚Äù - the more choice, the harder it is to choose.  We are experiencing this kind of paralysis in our everyday life: how to start a letter, what work to go to, which girl to meet, etc. <br><br>  Therefore, if you find a solution to this problem, you can get rid of procrastination.  What is the key to combating procrastination? <br><br>  I found one phrase that describes the key to victory over procrastination: <br><blockquote>  <em>A plan without action is a dream.</em> <br>  <em>Action without intention is a nightmare</em> <br><br>  <sup><em>Japanese proverb</em></sup> <br></blockquote>  These two simple lines describe the most important problems that we face in the modern world. <br><br>  There are people who want to start everything: a new life, running in the mornings, their own business, but they do not start.  There are people who do a lot, but do not see the point.  I do psychology, and in one of our studies, we realized that the <strong>cause of depression in people is the lack of meaning</strong> .  We call it corporate depression. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/tn/w6/jv/tnw6jvcsphc084h2-unohkcskzg.png"><br><br>  This is the formula of happiness.  It only requires two main ingredients: <br><br><ol><li>  Your own vision. <br></li><li>  Enough power to take action on the path to your vision. <br></li></ol><br>  Now there is a lot of good research about happiness.  Most of them show that the <strong>key to happiness is not in the realm of material things</strong> .  It is to live ‚Äúto the fullest‚Äù: to fill every day with meaning and move on the path to your vision. <br><br>  Next, we delve into the study of both ingredients - vision and action. <br><br><h2>  Vision </h2><br>  If you decide to formulate your own vision, first you need to understand the value of your time.  We all have one thing in common: we were born at one moment and we all die.  The gap between these points is our time, which we are free to dispose of. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/x3/u8/w3/x3u8w3tw8bx7dzshoglzy7halbi.png"><br><br>  One of the most important questions of our life is how to manage this time in your personal life or in your own business.  If you can formulate your personal vision, then you will be more motivated, you will have a more adequate relationship, you will be more healthy and the duration of your life will increase by 5-10 years. <br><blockquote>  <em>Finding the meaning of your own life is the most powerful motivator.</em> <br></blockquote>  There is one study in which older people asked what they regret and what lessons they learned from their lives.  They all had one thing in common. <br><blockquote>  <em>"People in their lives do not regret what they did, but regret what they did not do."</em> <br><br>  <sup>Philip Zimbardo</sup> <br></blockquote>  Therefore, it is very important to find your own meaning of life and move towards it.  Even if there are failures and setbacks on the path to personal vision, you will still feel better.  Sometimes in life you have to go through very difficult moments that radically change our outlook on life.  For example, if you limit access to drinking water for at least a week, in a week you will be quite different in assessing its availability. <br><br>  Sometimes we change our view of the world and the value of our own lives if we get very sick or we have many other problems.  I had this situation.  12 years ago I had severe health problems, I thought I was going to die. <br><br>  I played basketball and during the match my right hand began to shake.  After a few hours, the right side of my body was completely paralyzed.  None of the doctors could diagnose.  According to statistics in similar situations, some people die, but the other survives.  I was very lucky - I survived, and without any consequences.  But I experienced terrible moments of being dying. <br><br>  This has greatly changed my life, including my view of values, and helped me make important decisions.  I opened my own business and changed my field of activity (I finished the magistracy in IT).  Later, I wrote a book about how to start to value your time and how to spend less time on meaningless things, because <strong>procrastination is the complete opposite of full life</strong> . <br><br>  Therefore, the most important thing that I want to say, <strong>never forget about the value of time</strong> ! <br><br>  The second is to find the motivation. <br><br><h3>  Motivation </h3><br>  There are hundreds of studies studying procrastination and motivation.  Most of them show that the carrot and stick method, that is, external motivation, does not work. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/jn/r-/6k/jnr-6kxyqhsd_chblyni0gyppni.png"><br><br>  Why does not it work?  Because it gives a very short-term effect and people feel unhappy from the whip.  If you need to do something, but you do not want to do it, you will not be happy. <br><br>  The level of dopamine (the hormone of happiness in the head) falls.  Which, in turn, affects not only the level of happiness, but also creativity, productivity, and interpersonal skills ‚Äî in general, brain productivity drops. <br><br>  External motivation worked in its time, for example, when slavery existed.  It works when physical labor predominates.  But I believe that most of us need our intelligence in order to complete tasks.  Therefore, we need to find a mechanism to turn external motivation into internal. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ee/xb/dk/eexbdksy25ixt5ldbkxrwdgnwak.png"><br><br>  I used to believe that in life there are two key points: <br><br><ol><li>  Birth <br></li><li>  When we are aware of the full responsibility for privacy. <br></li></ol><br>  Most of us do not reach the second stage.  Therefore, the meaning of our life is to find, formulate a personal vision and move towards it, because we will be happy on the way to personal vision. <br><br>  In psychology, there is a term for this - a <strong>state of flow</strong> , that is, when we are so focused on a business, that we don‚Äôt think about any external elements.  Time stops for us, we are in the flow, we are concentrated, we enjoy the action. <br><br>  The state of flow is the complete opposite of procrastination, because <strong>in it we are the most productive</strong> , effective, use our creativity - we are happy! <br><br>  There is one study that studies the best people in their field - the best athletes, the best doctors, the best businessmen, writers and artists.  They all have one thing in common - a state of flow. <br><br>  How to find and improve the personal state of the stream?  How to find happiness in every moment of life? <br><br>  You need to change the perception of one model in your head.  Usually people think that the results lead us to satisfaction.  But research shows that everything is quite the opposite: <strong>if we are happy with what we are doing, then only then do we achieve results</strong> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/gn/im/cr/gnimcrdpqzg04tuuv3isom76liy.png"><br><br>  The words of Albert Schweizer describe the results of these studies: <br><blockquote>  <em>Success is not the key to satisfaction.</em>  <em>Satisfaction is the key to success.</em>  <em>If you love what you do, then you will be successful.</em> <br></blockquote>  There are three main components in order to achieve the flow state: <br><br><ol><li>  Meaning. <br></li><li>  Professionalism. <br></li><li>  Intrinsic motivation. <br></li></ol><br>  I want to highlight all these 3 ingredients. <br><br><h3>  Meaning </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/zq/4j/af/zq4jafp6baey-brdn1zn7buxmga.png"><br><br>  This is Sir Nicholas Winton, who during the Second World War saved 640 Jewish children from the Nazis.  He organized the trains, which sent these children to safe England.  Sir Nicholas Winton died at the age of 106 years.  It symbolizes what we call <strong>Ego 2.0</strong> . <br><br>  <strong>What is Ego 1.0 and Ego 2.0?</strong> <br><br>  Ego 1.0 is all we do for ourselves when we concentrate on ourselves.  But we are not always selfish.  Sometimes we do things for others, like Sir Winton.  We call it Ego 2.0 in the style of Mother Teresa. <br><br>  One very good study shows that one part of the brain physically works and grows when we perform actions related to Ego 2.0. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/lm/9i/bk/lm9ibksgigvozods4pm_lj3prok.png"><br><br>  Exclusively selfish people live a worse life, their average life expectancy is shortened and problems arise in their personal lives.  On the contrary, people who live in the concept of Ego 2.0 and give into this world live longer, happier and their lives are more successful, they have the strongest motivation for action. <br><br>  There is one Japanese word about which I would like to tell you - <strong>ikigai</strong> . <br><br>  In Japan, there are several regions in which the average life expectancy is 100 years.  This is 20-50 years longer than we live.  The secret of their longevity is what is called ikigai. <br><br>  Ikigai consists of 4 elements: <br><br><ol><li>  What you are strong at. <br></li><li>  What you like, what you enjoy. <br></li><li>  The element of Ego 2.0, when you give to the world - do what people need. <br></li><li>  Money, more precisely, that allows you to earn so much that you do not think about it. <br></li></ol><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/yk/fb/dp/ykfbdpaz73x3cz2fir6pttzww9a.png"><br><br>  All this together forms ikigai, if you find it in your life, you <strong>will live 20 or even 50 years longer</strong> , you will be happy and you will be able to find inner motivation. <br><br><h3>  Personal vision </h3><br>  The first tool I wanted to talk about was to write and formulate a personal vision.  For example, in the coming Sunday, take a pen and a piece of paper and try to formulate your personal vision: <br><br><ul><li>  Write out your values. <br></li><li>  Try to answer the question of how strong you are. <br></li><li>  Think about how you can be useful to society, how you can give to this world. <br></li></ul><br>  If you write all this and then regularly re-read it, you will be able to find motivation in yourself, because you will see the meaning of your actions. <br><br>  In the book, I have several tools that will allow you to most easily formulate your personal vision.  But a very important point - <strong>no need to procrastinate in writing a personal vision!</strong> <br><blockquote>  <em>Once a client came to me and said:</em> <br>  <em>- Take my money and write my personal vision.</em> <br>  <em>- I can not do it.</em>  <em>This is the only thing you have to do personally.</em> <br></blockquote>  Set aside some time on one of the days off.  Do not worry - this document should not look perfect.  You can start with the beta version, write a few sentences, but you need to start. <br><br><h2>  Act </h2><br>  In this part we will talk about how: <br><br><ul><li>  be more productive; <br></li><li>  manage personal time; <br></li><li>  prioritize. <br></li></ul><br>  All this fits into one word - <strong>self-regulation</strong> - the skill of giving yourself tasks and the skill of obeying.  We humans are doing very badly with this.  Every day we order ourselves to do something, but we never obey ourselves. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/t6/zb/ew/t6zbewnt234cell2mdr7_tmvrmo.png"><br><br>  Sometimes you want to start running, and you charge yourself: ‚ÄúThat's it, I'll run now!‚Äù But you just sit still.  Or we try to keep a diet, but at the same time we eat cupcakes.  We have been holding back all day, but after 18:00 we open the refrigerator. <br><br>  <strong>Why is it so difficult for us to maintain self-regulation?</strong>  The answer lies in understanding the structure of our brain. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/pp/tz/5r/pptz5rtmmp9jem-bolpfctoq4oi.png"><br><br>  The human brain is divided into 3 main parts: <br><br><ol><li>  The oldest part is the <strong>reptile brain</strong> .  This part of the brain can not be controlled by willpower.  None of us can commit suicide by holding our breath. <br></li><li>  The next part of the brain is the <strong>limbic system</strong> , which is responsible for our emotions. <br></li><li>  The last part of the brain - the <strong>neocortex</strong> - is very young compared to the rest, it is only a few hundred thousand years old.  This part of the brain is responsible for our rational actions, for making decisions.  It is our main difference from animals. <br></li></ol><br>  In the traditional system, it is believed that man is rational.  But this is not true. <br><br>  Studies show that the number of connection channels between the rational and emotional brain is 10 times less than the number of reverse channels - between the emotional and rational brain. <br><br>  In reality, <strong>our emotions dictate our actions</strong> , but using the rational brain, we can deceive ourselves and pass off such ideas as rational.  We are not rational.  In 2002, Daniel Kahneman received the Nobel Prize for this research. <br><br>  There are only a few people who do not procrastinate.  Who do you think it is?  Psychopaths!  Because the psychopath has a disturbed emotional part of the brain.  But these people make up only 1% of the population.  The rest have an emotional brain, and we just need to find the answer to the question of how to connect the work of the emotional and rational brain. <br><br>  I have one very simple explanation.  This is the metaphor of the elephant and the rider.  Imagine that there is a wild elephant and a rider who wants to ride it somewhere.  The elephant symbolizes our emotions: it is older, more, but lives only here and now.  Therefore, this particular elephant wants to order another beer or watch the next season of the Game of Thrones. <br><br>  The rider symbolizes our rational thinking.  He is weak but smart: he thinks about the future, makes plans, builds strategies.  He wants to be healthy, wants to play sports and other useful things. <br><br>  The rider needs to understand how to work with his elephant to get to the desired point. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/5w/c4/l-/5wc4l-cvdyytyoxoh4vintykfpi.png"><br><br>  Self-regulation is the skill of managing a personal elephant. <br><br>  The largest study of procrastination suggests that its cause is the lack of self-regulation.  The main point is to understand that an elephant lives in each of us and learn how to control it. <br><br>  The skill of controlling an elephant lies in our <strong>strength of will</strong> .  For clarity, imagine that your willpower is placed in a glass.  If you want to do something useful for yourself, the level of your willpower in the vessel decreases.  When we are tired, our strength is exhausted, the level of our willpower is zero, our elephant begins to jerk off. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/m8/vn/cd/m8vncd6m2b19zh12l1xk9nljtom.png"><br><br>  Our bad habits rise out, because we do not have the strength to give up the next cupcake, a glass of beer, etc. The procrastination works to its fullest when we are tired and we have no willpower. <br><br>  In this regard, I have two good news. <br><br>  <strong>1. Studies show that it is possible to restore the stock of will power during the day.</strong> <br><br><ul><li>  5-10 minutes walk can increase the level of willpower.  For example, work an hour, go for a walk, and work another hour. <br></li><li>  Sugar in fruits and vegetables affects the increase of willpower. <br></li></ul><br>  You can combine: work an hour, go for a walk, work another hour, eat some fruit.  As your willpower grows, you will be more productive and able to perform more tasks. <br><br>  I have one story to illustrate.  The forester walked through the forest and saw a woodcutter who was chopping wood with a blunt ax.  He approached and asked: <br><blockquote>  ‚ÄúWhy do you chop wood with an unfinished ax?‚Äù <br>  - Leave me alone!  I have no time!  I cut wood! <br></blockquote>  This situation occurs in the lives of many of us.  These are workaholic people who work 12 hours a day with a blunt ax.  Therefore, remember that <strong>if you stop, relax a little</strong> , think and sharpen your ax, that is, take a walk or eat a fruit, then our <strong>level of productivity will increase</strong> .  We can cut down a tree much faster. <br><br>  Therefore, the key to the result of productivity is rest during the day.  Do not regret that you rest. <br><br>  <strong>2. The second good news - the power of will can be pumped.</strong> <br><br>  Many studies have shown that <strong>willpower can be pumped up like a muscle</strong> .  If you, for example, do push-ups 20 times a day, your muscles will grow.  If you do an MRI in this case, you will see that not only your muscles grow, but also the physical frontal part of your brain, which is responsible for willpower. <br><br>  Even if you are a very cool procrastinator, then by working on yourself you can increase your willpower.  <strong>Procrastination is not embedded in our genes</strong> , and willpower too. <br><br>  There is one study that has studied identical twins in two different families.  One grew very happy and strong, with powerful willpower.  The other was much worse. <br><br>  Only 15-20% of our abilities are in the genes, the rest depends on us. <br><br><h3>  How to pump willpower? </h3><br>  If you can formulate your personal vision, it is very important that both the elephant and the rider move towards it. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/n0/uy/xh/n0uyxhjuswtsgjhrdtiqyg1zwiu.png"><br><br>  If you are able to flow, your elephant and rider both enjoy the path to personal vision at the same time.  The main point is to <strong>be able to flow 80% of your time</strong> . <br><br>  But there are barriers to the ideal life.  There are things we want to do, but our elephant doesn‚Äôt like them.  For example, one of our personal visions is a healthy lifestyle.  But for this you need to leave the house and run.  The elephant does not like to run!  Or, for example, one of our personal visions is the creation of a strong family.  This means that you need to approach the representative of the opposite sex.  But the elephant does not like the opposite sex. <br><br>  The problem is that our rider - the rational brain - understands what he wants and knows about how to achieve this, but our elephant - the emotional part - most often does not want it. <br><br>  How to deal with it?  How to solve this problem?  A million question! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ec/a8/wo/eca8woppnpphnnim0vucqy5tsjq.png"><br><br>  <strong>Do not scare the elephant!</strong> <br><br>  There is always a small action that the elephant will not be afraid of.  The key to success - <strong>start small</strong> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/d7/ye/3f/d7ye3felcqlw39wfzkzt1n3wr98.png"><br><br>  I mean this.  For example, you want to start running right tomorrow.  If you wind yourself up and think: ‚ÄúTomorrow I will have to run 5-10 km‚Äù, most likely you will scare away the elephant.  You just do not run, you pro-prostratem. <br><br>  But imagine that tomorrow you need to run at least until the next entrance, or just go out in sports uniform - this is the minimum barrier to entry.  Always start with the smallest, and then repeat it regularly. <br><br>  If you repeat the minimum step 20-30 times, sometimes 10 is enough, you will develop a habit.  These kinds of habits will help you strengthen your will power.  After that, you can raise your minimum and gradually raise it further. <br><br>  This is represented on the chart. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/7y/5h/wl/7y5hwlfmgxjdgzximrzsjvvakrs.png"><br><br>  Always start small and do not frighten your elephant at the beginning.  After you manage to form a habit, increase the amount.  It is pleasant to implement this kind of practice, because we don‚Äôt need to scare our elephant with ideas about something unreal, about large-scale changes right tomorrow.  We just need to step by step, gradually move and increase the minimum amount of changes. <br><br>  In English there is a term <em>Micro habits</em> (mini habits).  Remember that there is little much. <br><br><h3>  Kaizen </h3><br>  Another Japanese word I really like is <strong>kaizen</strong> .  Perhaps it is familiar to you.  Japanese samurai always practiced the <strong>action in small stages</strong> .  Even if you want to get to the very peak of the mountain, you should always start with separate steps on the steps up. <br><br>  You need to understand only 2 simple Japanese words - ikigai and kaizen.  I have a practical tool for this. <br><br><h3>  List Mushtra </h3><br>  In English, this tool is called a list of habits (or samoizdevok).  In Russian, the ‚Äúlist-mushr‚Äù is more appropriate.<font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It looks very simple - a table for 1 month in which you write down skills that you would like to receive, and a minimum that will not frighten your emotional part. </font></font><strong><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Every day,</font></font></strong><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> you have to mark what was successful and what was not. </font></font><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/gp/ey/_a/gpey_aqb_dbeyjmabr9t9omauec.png"><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">This method is very simple. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">If you encounter any difficulties in it, you can immediately see whether you are coloring or not, because you will simply have an empty list. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Da Vinci once said:</font></font><br><blockquote> <em><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">‚ÄúSimplicity is the perfect solution.‚Äù</font></font></em> <br></blockquote><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">This list-mushra allows us to develop certain skills and increase our own willpower. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">But the fact is that with an increase in willpower within these skills, it will increase no matter what you want to use it. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I will cite another study in which several sellers were taken and forced to run (voluntarily). </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The results showed that their sales began to grow. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">This proves that we have </font></font><strong><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">one willpower, and we can spend it on everything</font></font></strong><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> . </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Below is an example table of one of my clients.</font></font><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/uc/04/rz/uc04rzdcrnjuq6sjq8xuxi1ykjg.png"><br><br><ul><li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The first skill is the skill of filling the drill table itself. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">If you pro-grow it, then it obviously will not help you.</font></font><br></li><li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> The following habit includes all aspects of sleep: how many hours you sleep, what time you wake up and what time you go to bed. </font></font><br></li><li>    : , ,    . <br></li><li>          , , ,  . <br></li><li>      ,  1 ‚Äî  ,    , 10 ‚Äî     .      ‚Äî     . <br></li></ul><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Every day we specify the minimum steps to action. It takes only 2-3 minutes a day. For example, get up to half past seven, run at least 100 m, hold back and do not drink wine. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In this example, on the first day of the month, the person who filled the table woke up at 7 am, ran as much as 150 meters and did not drink a drop of alcohol. But, apparently, on the third day, he gave up a little and drank. The next day, his personal condition deteriorated - he did not fulfill the framework that he had set himself: he woke up at almost 10 o'clock, nor ran a single meter. But he was able to recover - he woke up in time the next day, resumed his run, drank quite a bit. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I think it is now clear how this table works.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It is very simple, but it greatly increases our chances of introducing new, useful habits into life. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It is important that the habits you write to the table are related to your personal vision. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">For example, if I want to learn how to play the piano and use this table to increase my results, but the piano has nothing to do with my personal vision, the whole table will be red. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">But if you fill this table with the skills and habits that will help you to achieve </font></font><strong><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">your personal vision</font></font></strong><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> , then you </font></font><strong><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">will enjoy the implementation, progress</font></font></strong><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> , and even the process of filling the table itself. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">You just feel much more energetic and happier.</font></font><br><br><h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> Heroism </font></font></h3><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Last practical tool. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I remind you:</font></font><br><br><ul><li> <em><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The first tool is a leaf with the formulation of a personal vision;</font></font></em> <br></li><li> <em><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The second tool is a list of habits (list-mushr)</font></font></em> <br></li><li> <em><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The last tool is heroism.</font></font></em> <br></li></ul><br> <strong><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">You can start doing it right now! </font></font></strong> <br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Why heroism? </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Usually, hearing this word, we present something unreal: such a powerful and disinterested act that does not fit in our mind - for example, someone prevented a terrorist attack. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">At the same time, small actions, for the commission of which we need to overcome something a little, can also be called heroism, just small. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Waking up from the first alarm clock is "a </font></font><strong><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">little act of heroism</font></font></strong><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> ."</font></font><br><br><h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> How to be a hero every day? </font></font></h3><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I learned this method from the person in the photo below. This is Professor Philip Zimbardo of Stanford University - the most famous psychologist who ever lived. He conducted the most interesting socio-psychological experiment called the Stanford Prison Experiment. </font></font><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/vq/ud/w4/vqudw4iz-vr_6pd86stfavgl08a.png"><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Zimbardo tested a group of volunteers - ordinary people, and chose the most "ordinary" volunteers. Then he divided them into two groups, one called ‚ÄúPrisoners‚Äù, and the second - ‚ÄúGuard‚Äù. The ‚ÄúPolice‚Äù arrived, arrested the ‚ÄúPrisoners‚Äù and put them in a ‚Äúprison‚Äù, where the ‚ÄúGuards‚Äù were already waiting for them. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">What do you think happened?</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Terrible things - people who played the role of guards, began to invent such harsh punishments that in a few days the research had to be stopped. After that, the psychologist spent 40 years to answer and understand where such aggression comes from. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Few know that Zimbardo also studied the issue of heroism. The answer to the question of why </font></font><br> <strong><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">some people stop in an emergency and try to do something</font></font></strong><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> is very interesting, because the causes of aggression and the causes of heroism are very similar. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Now I will explain why this is so. I met Zimbardo three times in my life. The first time was 5 years ago, before I wrote my book. I was interested in what his secret was, how he struggled with procrastination. In one of his books Zimbardo wrote the following phrase:</font></font><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/zs/v5/kf/zsv5kfrqbmvc5wjg4qjp_54xkn4.png"><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I think this is very important and I asked him if he knew how to force himself to do something. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Instead of answering me with words, Zimbardo did something unusual - he took a black marker and drew a large bullet point on his forehead. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I thought that maybe he was already beginning to be senile. </font></font><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/en/_g/hz/en_ghzuy7vyplsafm-x7fpsnh4k.png"><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Then he explained what is the meaning of his action. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">For me, this is one of the wisest thoughts that I would like to share with you. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Zimbardo said that if you go out in public with such a fat point on your forehead, for example, in a shopping center or in public transport, you will get used to the fact that people look at you differently. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">You start to get the hang of </font></font><strong><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">overcoming social comfort</font></font></strong><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> .</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> We, people, have 2 comfort zones: </font></font><br><br><ol><li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">On the physical level. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Imagine a warm bath in the morning or when you are alone in yours.</font></font><br></li><li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Social comfort zone. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">This means that we are a part of society.</font></font><br></li></ol><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/mu/qb/du/muqbdu-sryy1lh4qf2g71sbxeoq.png"><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">But outside the comfort zone there is a zone of discomfort when, for example, we wake up, get out of bed and start doing something, or when we stop next to an accident, or when we shout out to the crowd when everyone is silent. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The most important thought about heroism: the </font></font><strong><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">skill of overcoming a comfort zone is heroism. </font></font></strong> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/mc/ye/5i/mcye5ic9nq_tjklb1dyyaqq2ico.png"><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Nobody is born a hero. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">We become heroes, </font></font><strong><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">overcoming ourselves</font></font></strong><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> . </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Every time you overcome some personal difficulty, the chances that we will be able to overcome the same kind of difficulty in the future also increase.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">A similar study was conducted with children, they also drew a point on the forehead. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">A woman was put into the room who pretended she was ill. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Children with a dot painted on their forehead stopped much more often to help a woman than those whose forehead was not marked with a dot.</font></font><br><blockquote> <strong><em><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">To be a hero is to act. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The hero acts.</font></font></em></strong> </blockquote><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">An interesting note: the path to happiness lies outside our comfort zone. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Many people incorrectly believe that our happiness lies in our comfort zone, furnished with material values.</font></font> It is not true. <br><br> <strong><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">To be happy, we need to regularly overcome ourselves</font></font></strong><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> . </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Once Mahatma Gandhi said:</font></font><br><blockquote> <em><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Doing what we most fear is the first step to success.</font></font></em> <br></blockquote><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Being a hero for yourself means overcoming your own fears, going out of your own comfort zone. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">There is another quote from Einstein: </font></font><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/cp/u4/vf/cpu4vftt3s30mwariq-z8rjhkhm.png"><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Therefore, if you do not want to be ordinary, do not want your life to be filled with boredom and procrastination, you need to become a hero for yourself. If you act and show heroism, it </font></font><strong><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">will be easier for the rest to pull after you</font></font></strong><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> , because when the first person stops near a disaster zone, it will be easier for the rest to join him. </font></font><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ai/cp/lo/aicplont2s64yieoasw6bzzeele.png"><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The most important thing is to be the first in this situation, because if the first is not there, then no one will do anything.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">There is one story that happened in my hometown near Prague. Once an elderly man was sitting at the main power station, and he choked on food. He died for 10 minutes, and no one helped him. The cameras showed how many people pass by. 2 girls in general just sat side by side and continued chatting. Nobody helped him. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Do you think people are so evil, since they did not help a person?</font></font> Most likely no.<font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Just their skill of heroism was very poorly developed. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">They could not take the first step. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Most modern research proves that evil is passivity. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">This is a strong lever of influence on society. </font></font><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/l9/iq/tq/l9iqtqykepduadb7rhmpprryi2y.png"><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">This is Nazi Germany of the 30s. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It is evident that all these people idolize Hitler, but one person who opposes this. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Be that person! </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It is very important to follow your personal values. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The samurai have one tool for making a decision. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">When a samurai has a desire to be a hero in a certain situation, he applies the rule of 3 heartbeats:</font></font><br><blockquote> <strong><em><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Act for 3 seconds.</font></font></em></strong> </blockquote><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">If you drive past the accident, make a decision within the first seconds: 3, 2, 1 - and act immediately. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It is very important to act in these 3 seconds, because after your brain begins to invent excuses. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The following quote by Edmund Burke describes this situation well:</font></font><br><blockquote> <em><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">For the victory of evil, it is enough that good people do nothing.</font></font></em> <br></blockquote><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It seems to me that this quote is fair, because it is important to have personal values, but it is equally important to follow them. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Sometimes this is just a small simple step. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">For example, recently I passed by a burning urn, found water and extinguished the flame. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I spent only 3 minutes on this, but there were a lot of people around who were just passing by, although the fire was quite strong. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Remember, the heroes - 3, 2, 1 - and act!</font></font><br><br><ul><li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> You may have a chance to save someone's life. </font></font><br></li><li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> Perhaps you can change the society for the better. </font></font><br></li><li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> Perhaps you can start your own business that will change the world. </font></font><br></li></ul><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> From my point of view, heroism is the basis of my work. </font></font><br><br><h2>  Conclusion </h2><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> Now you know that to achieve personal happiness you need to work in two directions: </font></font><br><br><ul><li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> Vision. </font></font><br></li><li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> Act. </font></font><br></li></ul><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">You also have three tools for working on them: </font></font><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/w7/fa/l1/w7fal1_m1wenwosaqhmuzw6aoos.png"><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">If you put it all together, you can conquer your procrastination, your life will be filled with happiness, and you will inspire others. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I sincerely believe that if we want to change something in society, we must begin with ourselves, because the only way to influence others is to become better ourselves. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I would like to finish with one simple thought:</font></font><br><blockquote> <strong><em><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Do not prokrastiruyte when it comes to combating procrastination.</font></font></em></strong> </blockquote><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">If it seemed interesting to you, write down 1-2 tasks or habits that you are ready to introduce into your life tomorrow. I wish you to overcome your fears, to formulate your personal vision and every day to be a hero for yourself.</font></font><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/oj/3n/c5/oj3nc59rztk-azlgcwhwxhyrwt8.png"><br><br><blockquote>   ,    -  ,      ,    ,   ,     .   ,   -,       <a href="http://ritfest.ru/">++</a>  Highload++.  <a href="http://speakers.ritfest.ru/"></a>         <strong>9 </strong> .    <a href="http://conf.ontico.ru/lectures/propose%3Fconference%3Dhl2018-siberia"></a>    <a href="http://www.highload.ru/siberia/">Highload++ Siberia</a>     ‚Äî  <strong>30 </strong> . </blockquote></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/352072/">https://habr.com/ru/post/352072/</a></p>
