  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Cogear: amateur look</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img src="http://img190.imageshack.us/img190/8035/cogear.jpg" width="180" height="72" align="left">  I first learned about CMS Cogear on Habr√©, and it happened absolutely by accident.  However, the accident turned out to be very appropriate, since recently I was thinking about transferring the site of my project to another CMS.  It should be noted that Wordpress, with all its comforts, turned out to be very voracious, and the simple desire to learn something new turned into a serious need: systematic bursts of attendance, including habraeffect, left me no other choice. <br><br>  By the way, even if it were not necessary, I would still be engaged in switching to another CMS, because I want to realize the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãa significant expansion of the project. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  During the analysis of free CMS, I came to the conclusion that today two of them are the most promising: LiveStreet and Cogear.  After carefully reading the public opinion, a little googling and having tried it all in practice, I made my choice in favor of Cogear. 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>

          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      The reasons for making the choice are extremely subjective: IMHO, and Cogear, and Livestreet - good CMS, just the circumstances.  All the pros and cons listed below are extremely subjective. <br><br>  <u>First</u> , if you call things and people by their proper names, then I am an amateur.  I can edit something in CSS, but this is where my skills completely end.  In this sense, Cogear is very pleasant - the design of the regular template is very good, I edited everything I needed within 10 minutes.  Ahead of possible questions, I‚Äôll say that LiveStreet is certainly no less complicated, but Cogear has a very convenient admin panel from which you can manage almost everything you need. <br><br>  <u>Secondly</u> , compared to Wordpress Cogear, the server is much less heavy.  For me it is very important: the site is located on a shared-hosting.  I believe that the story with Habraeffekt not repeat, and Cogear will be much more enduring. <br><br>  <u>Thirdly</u> , they really like little things.  The jevix integrated typographer, easily disconnected and plug-in modules (here they are called ‚Äúgears‚Äù) make the transition from WP very, very easy. <br><br>  The ‚Äúgears‚Äù supplied with the CMS, by the way, cover 85% of the requirements of a not very demanding user: unlike WP, there is no need to put something like ‚ÄúAll-In-One SEO Pack‚Äù, ‚ÄúTweetMeMe Button‚Äù, ‚ÄúSitemap Generator‚Äù , ‚ÄúComment Notifier‚Äù, ‚ÄúOpenID‚Äù, etc.  - Complete gears easily do the same.  Here I want to express the creators of Cogear and personally Dmitry Belyaev a huge respect. <br><br>  Are there any downsides?  Sure.  The disadvantages can be called typical for all CMS, which cannot boast of world-wide recognition, namely, to the offensive few ‚Äúgears‚Äù of third-party developers, and also there are practically no additional templates.  However, all this is partly leveled by the fact that the regular Cogear template is quite good, but you need to do something with the number of plug-ins. <br><br>  Were there any problems with the installation and operation of CMS?  None: if you thoroughly follow the instructions that can be found on the official website of Cogear, then there will be no difficulties.  It's nice that the small but friendly community of Cogear willingly meets newcomers and helps with some issues related to the installation and operation of CMS. <br><br>  As an amateur I can say that such a category of unqualified users, like me, is vitally important analogue of the WP-plugin ‚ÄúContextual Related Posts‚Äù, which displays at the end of each entry the necessary number of similar ones.  However, in any case, Cogear leaves a pleasant impression, and I definitely will not return to WP. <br><br>  <u><b>References</b> :</u> <br><ul><li>  <a href="http://cogear.ru/">Official site Cogear CMS</a> . </li><li>  <a href="http://nepofigizm.ru/">New project on Cogear.</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://nepofigist.ru/">Old project on WP.</a> </li></ul><br><br>  <b>UPD</b> : I ask active minuses to express in detail their opinions on this issue in the comments. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/87860/">https://habr.com/ru/post/87860/</a></p>
