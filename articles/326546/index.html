Five key points of an effective site</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Today, most companies have their own website.  Obviously, this tool is necessary in the modern world, but does everyone know what results can be achieved by developing an effective marketing website? <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a11/079/f8e/a11079f8e1409fc907e4e431be135362.png" alt="image"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  According to statistics, 60% of users create a website to keep up with the times (or because competitors have it), but they do not know about all the possibilities that a competently developed resource can give them.  Suppose an entrepreneur got the idea to develop a site.  At the same time, he does not set a specific goal and objectives - he just wants to be present on the Internet.  What is he doing?  He asks the assistant to find a performer who will make it cheaper, faster and better than the competitor.  He wants a cool modern design with a WOW effect. <br><br>  This approach is fundamentally wrong!  The development of such a site will not give any results.  The objectives of creating a website should be business development, increasing customer loyalty and efficiency of interaction with them.  Therefore, the development should be based on an integrated approach.  If you didn‚Äôt ask yourself questions: how to increase the conversion, and make visitors from the site visitors, then it's time to think about it.  Even if your company exists only offline, it makes sense to ask about Internet capabilities, otherwise soon you will lose more than you think, while your competitors will win your customers. <br><br>  Often the site has no effect, and its owner believes that the site is not so necessary for this area.  But success lies in the system approach.  It‚Äôs not enough to create a website, you need to further promote it so that your potential customers can find you.

      The main task of the site is to increase profits.  To maximize the use of its capabilities, it is important to each do.  And all this must be considered at the initial stages of the development of the site. <br><br>  <i>We will not cover the technical aspects of development, but will consider this issue from the side of marketing.</i> <i><br></i> <br>  After working on a large number of sites, by trial and error, we identified indicators that affect the efficiency of the site. <br><br>  Let's look at 5 key points that are worth paying attention to during its development.  And if you already have a website, you can understand whether everything works on it as it should and correct the shortcomings so that your website can start selling now! <br><br><ul><li>  Targeted action </li><li>  Conviction </li><li>  Attraction </li><li>  Hold </li><li>  Analytics </li></ul><br>  Each of these aspects affects success in its own way, but all together they guarantee high conversion rates - what we expect from our site. <br><br><h4>  Let us consider in more detail each of the above points. </h4><br>  1. The starting point in creating a website is to define clear business goals expressed in specific <b>targeted actions</b> that can be measured. <br><br>  <i>For example:</i> <br><br><ul><li>  Add to Cart </li><li>  request a call back </li><li>  share the link on social networks </li><li>  view specific page </li><li>  buy </li><li>  and so on </li></ul><br>  To make a modern website that the head of the department will like is not a targeted action.  The site should generate leads, the visitor should turn into a subscriber and show his interest, leaving his contacts.  These actions are the right goals and are determined depending on the characteristics of your business, your desires and a number of other factors. <br><br>  For site visitors to perform a targeted action, you must: <br><br><ul><li>  know your customers well </li><li>  understand how and why people buy from you </li><li>  identify intermediate goals, the achievement of which will mean that you are on the right track </li></ul><br>  Remember that lost profit is a loss.  Learn the needs of your customers, understand their pain and help them solve problems. <br><br>  2. The next step is the visitor's motivation to perform the target action using the <b>tools of persuasion</b> . <br><br>  For each goal that we set at the first stage, it is necessary to apply levers of conviction (so that visitors choose you, not the competitor).  Before you is a difficult task - there are only 6 seconds (this is exactly what is required for the user to make a decision: to stay with you or leave the site) in order to interest the visitor.  During this time, he must have time to understand who you are, to feel interest and to understand that he must choose you.  There is a service fivesecondtest.com - you enter the address of the main page of the site and ask - what is this page / what does this company do?  Visitors look at the site for five seconds, after which they must answer the question.  Try to do this research with your site. <br><br>  The site should be user friendly.  Therefore, its creation begins with the tail, not with the head.  It is impossible to create a convenient site if it is done by an incompetent specialist. <br><br>  Why the site, developed by an experienced turnkey team, will have a higher conversion rate than a freelance novice patterned one?  Carrying out the project alone, he is unlikely to be able to cover the entire scope of work, which in large companies carry out from 7 to 10 competent specialists.  Many have a question - what do 7 people do, if only one man copes with the task?  For professionals and experienced users, the answer is obvious: there are no trifles in web development.  Each stage is closely interrelated with the other.  In order to achieve good results, a project team works on the site, in which everyone knows their site and is aware of how it will affect the subsequent stages of creating the site and the result as a whole.  A website on a template will not bring results - each business has its own characteristics and requires an individual approach.  You should not save on the creation of the site. <br><br>  The work of each specialist forms the tools of persuasion mentioned above. <br><br>  Leverage of persuasion are: <br><br><ul><li>  Copywriting - compelling texts to help you make the right decision. </li><li>  Design - using visual means convinces the visitor that he has come to the right place. </li><li>  Content - infographics, video and other visual content of the site. </li><li>  Usability is an intuitive site structure.  The user does not need to think about what and where to click to get the desired result.  We lead the client to the desired target action. </li><li>  Services - provide customers with convenience when choosing goods, making payments and so on.  With the help of services the site becomes more interactive. </li></ul><br>  A separate item can be identified chips.  They add zest to the site.  They can not be measured, but it is the chips that create the wow-effect and make the site fashionable, modern, and unique. <br><br>  In importance, each of these levers is equivalent.  Only for each situation you need your own ratio, which is dictated by your goals.  When developing a website, you need to be aware of how you can convince a client to take a targeted action. <br><br>  3. The third stage is <b>attraction</b> .  The most common mistake at this stage is to start attracting clients to a site where target actions have not yet been determined and the levers of conviction have not been worked out.  Your potential customers will simply come and go.  Therefore, check how effectively you have implemented the first two points. <br><br>  The main goals at this stage are to be noticed and to be mentioned.  Where and how to attract the audience? <br><br>  The main channels of promotion in the Internet: <br><br><ul><li>  search - you should be where your target audience is looking for </li><li>  advertising - paid, deserved, advertising offline </li><li>  social media - attracting an audience through social networks </li></ul><br>  Today, there are many opportunities and tools to attract customers - thematic areas, attending conferences, advertising from opinion leaders, and others (this is a topic for a hotel article).  Remember one important rule - place ads not where your competitors are, but where your customers are. <br><br>  Do not cease to study your target audience, always be guided by its preferences, try to get into the situation and solve problems.  Communicate with a potential client in his language, this will help increase his loyalty and, as a result, increase the number of sales. <br><br>  4. Understanding why customers are leaving, we will be able to return them - <b>retention</b> .  According to statistics, 80% of all purchases over the Internet are one-off.  If you know how to keep these customers, to make them permanent, the key to success is in your hands!  How to achieve this? <br><br><ul><li>  remind myself </li><li>  interest yourself </li><li>  form a good customer attitude to the brand </li><li>  motivate a client to contact you again and again </li></ul><br>  There are a lot of tools to retain customers: <br><br><ul><li>  SMS </li><li>  conduct webinars </li><li>  online helpers </li><li>  bonus system </li><li>  discounts </li><li>  FAQ </li><li>  e-mail marketing </li><li>  social networks </li><li>  blogs and forums </li><li>  feedback form </li><li>  retargeting </li><li>  other </li></ul><br>  Work with an already attracted audience!  You will increase efficiency without spending time and money on attracting customers. <br><br>  5. And the last stage is <b>analytics</b> .  The main task of web analytics is to monitor site traffic, on the basis of which data its audience is determined and the behavior of visitors is studied (to make decisions on the development and expansion of the functionality of a web resource).  Web analytics allows you not only to work on improving websites, but also to work on optimizing the budget for online promotion. <br><br>  Web analytics methods include: <br><br><ul><li>  site attendance analysis - statistics, trends, absolute and relative indicators </li><li>  analysis of data from e-commerce - the average check, popular products, income in the context of channels to attract traffic </li><li> usability analysis - click density, visitor conversion paths on the site, scrolling </li><li>  analysis of the behavior of visitors on the page - interaction with forms, the commission of micro-and macro-conversions </li><li>  benchmarking - comparison with general trends and indicators of competitors using independent platforms (Alexa, GemiusAudience, Google Trends) </li></ul><br>  Constant analytics of actions on the site will allow to increase work efficiency, attract more customers, increase sales. <br><br>  Of course, this topic is very extensive, and in one article it is difficult to describe all the details of this issue.  You can talk about them for a long time, but first try to evaluate your current website on the points listed above: are each of them carefully worked out?  We recommend to think about it if you are interested in developing your business and increasing sales. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/326546/">https://habr.com/ru/post/326546/</a></p>
