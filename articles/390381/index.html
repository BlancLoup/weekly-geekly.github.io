      Today, the iCover team decided to choose <a href="http://www.icover.ru/catalog/category/podarok_sebe/%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_medium%3Dcm%26utm_campaign%3D14febgt">gifts for our favorite geeks</a> .  And since most often we choose them for ourselves - this is what happened with us: <br><br><h2>  <font color="¬´#6aa400¬ª"><a href="http://www.icover.ru/catalog/product/huawei_honor_band_umnye_chasy_black/%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_medium%3Dcm%26utm_campaign%3D14febgt">Huawei Honor Band (Black) - Fitness Bracelet + Smart Watch - 5990 Rub</a></font> </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/cca/59b/31c/cca59b31cf8e45fe87da3fb4e7f19d54.jpg"><br><br><h2>  <font color="¬´#6aa400¬ª">Specifications</font> </h2><br><ul><li>  Materials: silicone strap, protective glass, aluminum bezel </li><li>  Dimensions: 229.4x38x9.5 mm </li><li>  Weight: 40 grams </li><li>  Display: OLED, 128x128 pixels </li><li>  Battery: built-in 70 mAh </li><li>  Protection: IP68 standard, against water and dust. </li></ul><br>  Having released the Honor Band fitness bracelet with the design of Huawei watches, it has once again proved that functionality, benefits and impeccable style can be offered for more than affordable price.  The model, offered with dials in classic black and white colors, with black, white and cream straps, is distinguished by its strict style, which is minimalist, the complete absence of functional elements on the case. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/8eb/2a2/da5/8eb2a2da5b3b44e98cffcb001b557ba6.jpg"><br><br>  The touchscreen OLED display is covered with protective glass and is edged with aluminum at the periphery, the lower part is plastic.  The strap of hypoallergenic silicone is very pleasant to the touch, does not cause negative emotions even with prolonged wear, it looks neat, stylish and original due to the textured pattern on the outside.  With a weight of 40 grams, the dimensions of the device are quite compact, well below the size of a standard smart watch: 229.4x38x9.5 mm.  Dustproof and waterproof, the enclosure is made in accordance with the requirements of the IP68 standard - a valuable advantage for outdoor enthusiasts. <br><br>  In contrast to the flagship smart watches on Android Wear / WatchOS Honor Band is equipped with a simple display of a little more than an inch with a resolution of 128x128 pixels.  However, if you do not chase the values, such a resolution is quite enough for comfortable reading of useful information.  Spending a charge very economically, the OLED-display allows the most active bracelet owner to comfortably use the gadget for up to 4 days with a minimum capacity of the built-in battery of 70 mAh. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/1a6/7bf/4d1/1a67bf4d19c741afb506d5508b11fdb8.jpg"><br><br>  Having got rid of the function buttons, Huawei engineers supplied the device with a motion sensor that activates the display when raising a hand.  Activation is also possible by clicking on the screen area.  Further control of the functionality becomes possible on the touch screen by scrolling through the catalog from top to bottom or vice versa and selecting the appropriate menu functions, and if desired, using certain gestures. <br><br><h2>  <font color="¬´#6aa400¬ª">OS and Functional</font> </h2><br>  Acting in accordance with the concept of the gadget, in which simplicity, convenience and functionality are central, engineers have entrusted the management of the functions of the bracelet to their own concise and intuitive Huawei OS.  On the splash screen, you will see the time, date, charge information, and Bluetooth connectivity.  Screens are switched down with the help of a swipe.  Consistently displays the number of steps completed - the time, the number of calories burned, spent last night in a dream, the data of the manual timer and the setting of the bracelet.  The ‚Äúsmart alarm clock‚Äù and the timer of physical activity are also available. <br><br>  Working with information is possible with the help of the proprietary application Huawei Wear, which is available for installation, both on Android devices from versions 4.0 and above, and on devices with iOS 7 and above.  The bracelet syncs seamlessly with Jawbone Up, Apple Health and MyFitnessPal. <br><br><h2>  <font color="¬´#6aa400¬ª"><a href="http://www.icover.ru/catalog/product/xiaomi_mi_band_1s_fitnes_braslet_dlya_ios_i_android_black/%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_medium%3Dcm%26utm_campaign%3D14febgt">Xiaomi Mi Band 1S Pulse - fitness bracelet with heart rate monitor for 3490 rubles</a></font> </h2><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/5a1/0e4/40b/5a10e440bcc041d7a696a6ad4f2c3ffa.jpg"><br><br><h2>  <font color="¬´#6aa400¬ª">Specifications</font> </h2><br><ul><li>  Type: fitness bracelet without a screen with a pulse sensor </li><li>  Monitoring: sleep, calories, physical activity </li><li>  Built-in sensor: heart rate (heart rate) </li><li>  Platform Support: Android 4.4 and up </li><li>  Vibration: is </li><li>  Bracelet Material: Silicone </li><li>  Moisture protection: yes, IP67 </li><li>  Bracelet length adjustment: yes </li><li>  Interfaces: Bluetooth 4.0 LE </li><li>  Battery: non-removable Li-Ion </li><li>  Battery capacity: 45 mAh </li><li>  Work time: 720 h </li><li>  Type of charging connector: own </li><li>  Dimensions: 37 x 13.6 x 9.9 mm </li><li>  Weight: 5.5 g </li></ul><br><br>  Health - the last thing worth saving, because such savings in the end is too expensive.  But if there is an opportunity to purchase a thing that is beneficial to health, is quite inexpensive and not at the expense of quality and reliability, then why pay more?  Xiaomi, a young Chinese company, adheres to this philosophy, for which the quality and affordability of products have become synonymous with the brand.  A wonderful example of Xiaomi products, whose merits have already been appreciated by the end consumer, can safely be called an inexpensive and functional <a href="http://www.icover.ru/catalog/product/xiaomi_mi_band_1s_fitnes_braslet_dlya_ios_i_android_black/%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_medium%3Dcm%26utm_campaign%3D14febgt">Mi Band</a> bracelet <a href="http://www.icover.ru/catalog/product/xiaomi_mi_band_1s_fitnes_braslet_dlya_ios_i_android_black/%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_medium%3Dcm%26utm_campaign%3D14febgt">1S Pulse</a> - a representative of the new generation of the Xiaomi Mi Band line. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/4b3/288/89b/4b328889b24346da8863da00095e8ec2.jpg"><br><br>  Mi Band 1S will help you not only set goals, but also track their implementation, solve many pressing problems associated with maintaining a healthy lifestyle - observe sleep and physical activity, track heart rate using the built-in heart rate monitor (appeared in this model), record the distance traveled, the number of steps, calories expended and many other significant indicators. <br><br>  With a weight of 5.5 grams, the bracelet remains almost unnoticeable on the arm, while the design meets the criteria of the IP67 standard - being dustproof, the tracker is not afraid of moisture and, as Xiaomi asserts, withstands short-term immersion in water to a depth of 1 m without consequences. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/def/10b/2d2/def10b2d26dc4389aa888add0e7defb5.jpg"><br><br>  Heart rate monitoring (pulse rate) allows you to track changes in this important indicator during exercise, when the body is under increased stress.  At the same time, in order to save battery power, you activate the function at those times when you are interested in obtaining the necessary readings. <br><br>  The information collected by your little assistant for the day will allow you to get an accurate picture of the compliance of your plans for maintaining the health of the real picture and, if necessary, to quickly make the necessary corrections.  If necessary, you can set the bracelet to program the bracelet for a specific goal that you plan to achieve during the day.  In this case, when it is reached, you will receive a notification. <br><br><h2>  <font color="¬´#6aa400¬ª">Synchronization with iOS and Android</font> </h2><br>  In order for your Mi Band 1S Pulse bracelet to fully reveal all its advantages and successfully cope with its tasks, you will need a smartphone on iOS and Android, with which the gadget is synchronized via Bluetooth.  Despite the miniature and small battery capacity, the bracelet is able to work without recharging for 30 days, while maintaining functionality with temperature drops from -20 to + 70. <br><br><h2>  <font color="¬´#6aa400¬ª">Controlling a quadcopter with a bracelet</font> </h2><br>  If you believe the latest news, Xiaomi enters the drones market and is going to entrust the management of them with gestures to the bracelets of the Mi Band line.
