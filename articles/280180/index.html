I went to the payments, chose ‚ÄúHistory‚Äù, scrolled the list scroller to the desired payment, chose it, and then clicked the ‚ÄúOperations‚Äù button and selected the print.  And so it was repeated for each check: each time there was a transition to the main menu and everything started anew.  I wondered - really, despite the abundance of sources of information on <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259E%25D0%25BF%25D1%258B%25D1%2582_%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B7%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BC%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B9%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B8%25D1%258F" title="Ux">UX</a> , huge budgets are still being spent on such inconvenient interfaces?  Why developers do not want to make an interface that allows the user to feel like a magician, and make users helpless in achieving their goals?  Perhaps the reason is that, despite the abundance of theory, these sources provide few examples from real projects. <br><br>  Since we literally completed a <a href="https://community.devexpress.com/blogs/news/archive/2016/04/23/asp-net-dashboard-designer-ctp.aspx" title="DevExpress Web Dashboard Designer CTP">large Web project</a> last week, in which the goal was to develop a user-friendly interface, I decided to highlight in the article what major points in designing an interface worth paying attention to and gave examples of our solution. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h1>  What is a magic interface? </h1><br>  <a href="http://www.ozon.ru/context/detail/id/1332088/" title="Jeff Raskin 'Interface', Symbol Plus, 2010; p. 20">The interface is</a> usually called the set of ways in which you perform any tasks with the help of a product, or rather the actions you take and what you get in return. <br>  Based on this, the magic interface is the interface that executes what you want.  However, we will try to give a definition closer to real life. <br>  Psychologists have noticed that when using different things, users have <a href="https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/article/donald-norman-s-three-levels-of-design" title="Donald Norman ‚ÄòEmotional design‚Äô, Basic Books, 2004; p.21">three levels of cognitive processing</a> involved: <br><ul><li>  visceral (produces an internal positive impression) </li><li>  behavioral (corresponds to the <a href="https://www.quora.com/What-is-a-mental-model" title="What is a mental model">mental model</a> ), </li><li>  analytical (establishes an emotional connection with the user, attracts to further study and gain experience of use). </li></ul><br>  Each level corresponds to the achievement of certain <a href="http://www.ozon.ru/context/detail/id/4562908/" title="Alan Cooper 'On the Interface', Symbol Plus, 2009; p. 127">goals by</a> users.  Objectives achieved at the first and last levels of cognitive processing, lie in the field of emotions and user identity.  Behavioral (end) goals correspond to the technical purpose of the thing, regardless of the user's identity.  Here it is only worth noting that each person will have his own unique scenario leading to the final goal, i.e.  each will tell his <a href="http://www.ozon.ru/context/detail/id/4562908/" title="Alan Cooper 'On the Interface', Symbol Plus, 2009; p. 123">story</a> on how to achieve it.

      So, if the interface impresses every user, allows you to achieve the desired through a sequence of intuitive actions, and is also remembered or even becomes part of everyday life, then users could call such an interface <i>magical</i> . <br><br>  Is it possible to create a magic interface in a specific subject area?  When creating the <a href="https://demos.devexpress.com/DashboardDesigner/" title="DevExpress Web Dashboard Demo">DevExpress Web Dashboard</a> , we considered it possible. <br><blockquote>  <i>The goal of the DevExpress Web Dashboard project (hereinafter referred to as Dashboard) was to create an interactive analysis panel with a given set of visualization elements, the ability to filter and group.</i>  <i>Unfortunately, at the development stage, due to the nature of the business, we did not have access to real users of the product, so the users were various employees of our company and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Lean-UX-Applying-Principles-Experience/dp/1449311652" title="Jeff Gothelf 'Lean UX', O‚ÄôReilly, 2013; p. 26 and Alan Cooper, On the Interface, Symbol-Plus, 2009; p. 109">fictional characters</a> .</i> <i><br></i> </blockquote><br>  Below I will consider the interesting features of the interface, in our opinion, claiming to be ‚Äúmagical‚Äù. <br><blockquote>  <i>For each feature, I will give examples of how we did in our project, and compare the implementation of some of them with our similar product for another platform.</i> </blockquote><br><br><h1>  The nature of a positive impression </h1><br>  The basis of the positive inner feeling is the attractiveness of the interface design from the side of the person's feelings (sight, hearing, taste, smell, touch).  External influence stimulates the work of the corresponding sense organ, which transmits information to the brain.  As a result, a person perceives this external influence, he has positive or negative sensations.  In the case of software interfaces, the impact is usually the appearance of the interface, and the sensation is vision. <br>  Are there any universal recipes, how to make this or that impact lead to the necessary perception? .. How to understand and evaluate whether you have made a good, attractive interface?  Well-known industrial designer <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A0%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BC%25D1%2581,_%25D0%2594%25D0%25B8%25D1%2582%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580" title="Dieter rams">Dieter Rams,</a> in search of an answer to these questions, formulated <a href="https://www.vitsoe.com/us/about/good-design" title="Dieter Rams: ten principles for good design">10 principles of good design</a> , suitable for any kind of interface.  There are also many sources where fashion trends and typical solutions in the design of visual interfaces are described.  In spite of everything, the fact that the user likes the appearance of the interface depends primarily on the personality of the designer, who, in turn, seeks inspiration anywhere.  It seems that here as in painting - how to draw a portrait is described in any textbook on the basics of fine art, but only one person painted the Gioconda. <br><blockquote>  <i>At Dashboard, we fully rely on the artistic taste, intuition and experience of our main designer.</i> <i><br></i> </blockquote><br><br><h1>  From beginner to expert </h1><br>  <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259A%25D1%2583%25D0%25BF%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580,_%25D0%2590%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BD" title="Alan cooper">Alan Cooper</a> recommends creating an interface so that the beginner quickly starts working, the expert finds the functionality he needs, and the average user comfortably performs his daily tasks.

For example, my Microsoft Natural Ergonomic keyboard allows you to disable the F-mode (F Lock is next to the F12 I often use) and I occasionally find that when I press F5, I don‚Äôt understand for some time why what I‚Äôve been expecting .  Also, in many modern development environments, it is not possible to add / delete / edit modules, etc. in the application execution mode. <br><blockquote>  <i>In the Dashboard, we were able to exclude elements that have different behavior depending on any mode.</i>  <i>We also did not begin to do the preview mode (you immediately work with live data), did not separate the settings mode of the elements and the analysis panel layout.</i>  <i>However, we made a mode that changes the accessibility of editing elements primarily because editing should be available to a limited number of users.</i>  <i>In addition, the direct analysis of the data is not necessary in many windows settings.</i> <i><br></i> <div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Modes: viewer (for business analyst to work) and editor (for administrator-creator of dashboards)</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/r8IllnfCNCE%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=25657,15700002,15700023,15700186,15700190,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhgt5K-diMnC6W3HbmOFtNSzl629oA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br></div></div><br></blockquote><br><br><h1>  Load indicators </h1><br>  Often we hear the expression "How does it slow down!".

The success of companies (Apple, Dyson, etc.) that take these principles into account when developing the interfaces of various devices has already spurred many to take the nuances of human perception and usability more seriously.
