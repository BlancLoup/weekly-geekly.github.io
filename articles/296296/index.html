Texts, videos, large customers - perhaps it is not surprising that content marketing occupies an important place in our marketing strategy.  In this post I will tell you exactly what and how we are doing in this direction. <br><br> <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/alconost/blog/296296/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/4cc/98b/0da/4cc98b0da88445479573320aa6fa70c7.jpg"></a> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Let's start with the obvious: we have been writing and translating articles for our blogs on Habrahabr ( <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/alconost/blog/">http://habrahabr.ru/company/alconost/blog/</a> ) and Megamind ( <a href="http://megamozg.ru/company/alconost/blog/">http://megamozg.ru/company/alconost/blog/</a> ) for a long time .  Not so long ago they were joined by a <a href="http://spark.ru/startup/alconost/blog/">blog on Spark</a> , which, although less effective for us, is free and does not take much time.  Due to the fact that we have a lot of full-time translators, translation of an article takes very little time, and the return on such publications is often even higher than on the author‚Äôs own essay materials.  By the way, we are ready to help other blog authors with translations :)

      But the content marketer is not alive with Habrom alone.  We prepare articles and comments for other media and portals that our target audience visits.  <a href="https://pressfeed.ru/">Pressfeed</a> helps us <a href="https://pressfeed.ru/">find</a> publications that need expert comments.  The principle of the service is simple: twice a day you get a list of requests from journalists and directly on the site you answer those of them that are relevant to your business interests.  This does not mean that we give comments only about localization and video clips: for example, we <a href="https://vc.ru/p/dacha-work">shared our experience with remote work in the country outside the city of</a> Vc.ru. <br><br>  We also pay attention to publications in other people's blogs, including foreign ones.  One <a href="http://www.exler.ru/blog/item/15660/">post by Alex Exler</a> about Nitro's professional online translator brought us dozens of new users. <br><br>  We post videos of our own production on Youtube ( <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/AlconostTube">https://www.youtube.com/user/AlconostTube</a> ).  This is not only a variety of trailers, teasers, tutorials and animated logos.  We make a lot of useful or just funny videos for our Youtube channel: for example, about how <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DTPnuw879WgQ">much space exploration costs</a> compared to the budgets of IT giants, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DbnjpluFjEBI">when it‚Äôs best to start a business</a> , what is the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3D98dfCH9Mu3c">true price of waiting on the Internet</a> or how it looked would <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3D88BBtR9clh8">stobax banknote in a variety of artistic styles</a> .  We make such videos not only for marketing purposes, but also for our own entertainment and leveling skills.  And then these videos diverge on social networks, decorate a blog post, are sown in forums and popular question-answer services ... <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/9a0/16e/2f5/9a016e2f53fc47e1a43e6fb2c8c15b59.jpg"><br><br>  Speaking of question and answer services.  Only one answer to the question about the translator from Japanese to English, where we unobtrusively <a href="https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-best-Japanese-English-online-translator">recommended</a> our <a href="http://alconost.com/services/professional-online-translation%3Futm_source%3Dmegamozg%26utm_medium%3Darticle%26utm_campaign%3Down_article%26utm_content%3Dcontent-marketing">live translator Nitro</a> , received more than 17 thousand views (not every blog post is able to collect so much) and brings us new leads for a year. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d2c/00b/954/d2c00b9540104a8fb7226d2b3d4d25d3.jpg"><br><br>  Another source of content is our own experience: we regularly prepare new client <a href="http://alconost.com/cases%3Futm_source%3Dmegamozg%26utm_medium%3Darticle%26utm_campaign%3Down_article%26utm_content%3Dcontent-marketing">cases</a> for our site, conduct webinars, attend conferences with reports, and then post presentations at Slideshare ( <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/alconost">http://www.slideshare.net/alconost</a> ). <br><br>  Naturally, we care about our accounts in social networks: we distribute already created content and generate new for our Facebook ( <a href="http://facebook.com/Alconost">http://facebook.com/Alconost</a> ), Google+ ( <a href="https://plus.google.com/112093477120669197918">https://plus.google.com/112093477120669197918</a> ), Linkedin ( <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/company/alconost">http://www.linkedin.com/company/alconost</a> ), Twitter ( <a href="http://twitter.com/alconost">http://twitter.com/alconost</a> ) and Vkontakte ( <a href="https://vk.com/alconost_inc">https://vk.com/alconost_inc</a> ). <br><br>  And our clients each month receive a tasty newsletter with a selection of useful articles and burning videos - a concentrate of all the above. <br><br><h3>  <font color="#0096d6"><b>How to create the right content marketing strategy?</b></font> </h3><br>  There is no universal answer.  It helps previous experience as a journalist, editor, PR-manager.  It is necessary to understand well what content will be in demand most of all at one site or another, and then try to make it as appetizing as possible and noticeable to the audience.  Tools like <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/today/posts">Pulse</a> Linkedin, services like <a href="http://buzzsumo.com/">Buzzsumo</a> , and the same analysis of the weekly top of the most popular articles of Habr and Mega Brain help in this. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a4c/782/d5d/a4c782d5daed4f32a895e751dffb933c.jpg"><br><br>  It is important to be friends with analytics: we are looking at Google Analytics, the return on which channels are better and which do not work, and therefore does not deserve a waste of time.  For example, we ran a corporate blog on Geektimes, but it turned out to be not as effective for us as the blog on Habr√©.  Therefore, we no longer invest our time and money in it. <br><br>  The fact of informational issues becomes much more when a company has good internal communication between departments.  Our marketers will immediately find out from employees about news on completed projects, new videos and articles.  Each employee sends such news independently through a form to Google Docs, his message is immediately sent to the rest by email and automatically entered into the news table for marketers - convenient! <br><br>  Moreover, colleagues even take the time to share an idea for publication or write a blog article in person.  For example, our technical documentation guru, Alexander Zinchuk, has compiled a great guide on <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/alconost/blog/255373/">how to take screenshots correctly</a> .  Already in the first two weeks after the publication, this post received more than 58 thousand views and brought new clients to us, wishing to order the development of reference documentation. <br><br>  The best topics are from my own experience, the closest, the most deeply studied.  When knowledge becomes so much that they want to share.  This is how the ‚Äúhit‚Äù articles about <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/alconost/blog/222865/">how we organized work without an office</a> , <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/alconost/blog/229005/">how we communicate with clients</a> , <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/alconost/blog/227375/">how it works in Montenegro</a> , <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/alconost/blog/220805/">how to make video clips for games</a> and many others, were born. <br><br><h3>  <font color="#0096d6"><b>So is it worth it?</b></font> </h3><br>  For us - a company that does not have millions of marketing budgets, but who wants to retain leadership positions in the niche of localization, translation and video production - content marketing has proven effective and rewarding.  Moreover, we are convinced that content marketing is the future.  Maybe it does not work at lightning speed, but the return from it lasts for days, weeks, months, and even years.  This is an excellent source of loyal customers who are ready to immediately make an order.  This is a great way to be on the ear and constantly remind of yourself.  This is what shows people - we are close, we are lively, warm and we know how to joke.  Only one minus - all this requires a lot of time, resources, forces and constant experiments.  But in our case, the costs of content marketing are fully justified.
