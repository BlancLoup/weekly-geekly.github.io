The introductory part about what social news sites are in the era of web 2.0 with a brief description of one of such Ukrainian projects <a href="http://mynews.com.ua/">MYNEWS</a> , perhaps, will be omitted.  For those who are interested you can read the <a href="http://tods-blog.com.ua/uanet/mynews-newspaper/">corresponding post</a> on this topic in my blog. <br><br>  So, the life of this site since the beginning of 2008 has been very standard.  Although the service did not stand out for anything unique, this did not prevent it from developing evenly in a positive direction - attendance grew, an active user group was formed.  Moscow (News2.ru) was not built right away either.  And all this continued until the summer, until something unusual happened.  In the top there was news from the author himself, part of the text of which I present to your attention: <br><blockquote>  <em>Hello.</em>  <em>June 2008 is coming.</em>  <em>In fact, another month of another year, if not for one "But."</em>  <em>In June 2008 it is planned to produce a free morning newspaper based on the site MYNEWS.</em>  <em>Those.</em>  <em>all the news that you ‚Äútoday‚Äù brought to the top, ‚Äútomorrow‚Äù will be printed in the newspaper, of course, with reference to the source (if available), with the name of the publishing user and, which is not in any newspaper, the most popular comments.</em> </blockquote><a name="habracut"></a>  Again, I will spare you from my reflections on how unusual it would be to observe a situation when quite real people read a note from your blog on their way to work in the subway, and then, being in the office, they may visit the site itself.  Or, for example, during the next smoke break, the admins of an average computer firm will not discuss Habr's news, but your article.  Instead, I post an interview with the author of the project, which, I think, will be able to clarify something: <br><br>  <strong>1. Hi.</strong>  <strong>How did such an original idea come to mind?</strong> <br>  Actually, this idea was in my head from the very first day of the creation of the project.  I really wanted to have some very significant distinctive feature, I wanted to do something that no one else had done, at least in Ukraine. <br>  And in Kiev, they were already actively distributing free newspapers, the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãwhich I really liked.  But the usual newspaper did not want to - journalists, editors, censorship, etc.  I wanted something new, light, youth.  So the idea was born to combine the site and print.

      <strong>2. Any specific details - when can we expect a newspaper?</strong>  <strong>What will be the initial circulation?</strong>  <strong>Let even approximate numbers.</strong> <br>  We are planning to release the first issue of the newspaper on June 23/24.  Circulation we think will be at least 1000 copies.  Already agreed with information agencies to not violate their copyright.  The number by 20 should be ready for T-shirts so that people who will distribute newspapers can be clearly seen. <br><br>  <strong>3. I know that at first it will be distributed at 2 metro stations (where there are many students).</strong>  <strong>What are the future plans to promote the publication to the masses?</strong>  <strong>And in general, how bright is the future?</strong> <br>  Prime plans - all Kiev metro stations.  We also plan to deliver newspapers to large office centers in Kiev.  And then the cities of Ukraine with the largest number of Internet users.  After all, we are not an ordinary newspaper, but we can say an online newspaper. <br><br>  <strong>4. Interested in the material side of the issue.</strong>  <strong>Are there any sponsors, how, actually, are you planning to become self-sufficient or even profit?</strong> <br>  At the moment there are no sponsors, and we are not looking for it either :) everything is financed at its own expense.  Regarding monetization, probably nothing original - we expect the growth of the project‚Äôs popularity, with which advertisers will come.  Our only difference is that we will have 2 advertising platforms - a website and a newspaper.  <strong>5. For what purpose do you launch this project - both for yourself and globally, why is this necessary?</strong> <br>  First, there has never been such a project in Ukraine.  It is always interesting to do something completely new.  Secondly, we give ordinary people even more opportunities for self-affirmation, communication, self-expression, etc. <br>  Thirdly, the project will be a source of interesting information, which was published and selected by ordinary users.  Neither the site nor the newspaper will not be clamped in any frame format.  What we want, then publish - freedom!  The newspaper will have not only an article on some topic, but also comments, which, again, users considered the most significant / correct / ridiculous ... . <br><br>  <strong>6. Sometimes it seems that you work alone.</strong>  <strong>Is this really true?</strong> <br>  Do not believe it is true.  What I do not have time or do not know how, then I order from those who have time / can <br><br>  <strong>7. First, the news site, now the newspaper, you do not think to work with a permanent team?</strong> <br>  I understand that sooner or later I will come to this.  Just now it turns out to cope without a permanent team.  When I stop coping, the command will appear. <br>  <strong>8. What else can you add at the end?</strong>  <strong>To interest, surprise or wish future readers of the print edition?</strong> <br>  Readers of the print edition I would like to wish a pleasant surprise, a SHOCK condition :) They have never seen such a print edition, I hope they will like it. <br>  I wish you all success in any positive endeavors. <br><br>  - What do you think about this event?  Will it be possible to launch a newspaper, how popular can it be?  And personally, would you read it in the morning on the subway on the way to work?  Write your thoughts and wishes in the comments, it is interesting to hear your opinion! <br><br>  <em>PS Attention.</em>  <em>In order not to criticize me for no reason, I want to dot some of the "i".</em>  <em>1. I have nothing to do with the site;</em>  <em>2. The note was not written for its PR or promotion of my blog;</em>  <em>3. I consider the discussion of this very original project can be interesting both for Habr's readers, and to benefit the author in the form of a wish or sensible remarks;</em> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/26967/">https://habr.com/ru/post/26967/</a></p>
