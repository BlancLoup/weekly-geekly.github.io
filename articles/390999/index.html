This opinion is based on the study "The positive impact of industrial robots on employment", conducted <a href="http://www.robo-hunter.com/uploads/files/56cddf9c5d901.pdf">by Metra Martech</a> . <br><br>  It noted that the million industrial robots that are now engaged in manufacturing create about three million jobs, and a further increase in their number will lead to the creation of another million jobs for highly skilled employees around the world in the next 5 years.  Mostly new jobs will be created in industries such as consumer electronics, food, alternative energy (solar and wind) and the creation of new types of batteries. <a name="habracut"></a>

    <h3>  Industrial robots save production sites and millions of jobs </h3><br>  In addition to the fact that a million new jobs are expected to appear, the authors of the study also point out that existing jobs will also be saved.  This means that restaurants, shops and services will benefit from this situation. <br><blockquote>  ‚ÄúToday, from 3 to 5 million jobs simply would not exist if there was no automation of production and if the development of robotics did not lead to the optimization of the production of millions of electronics goods - from telephones to set-top boxes,‚Äù the report from the study published by Metra says Martech in November 2011. <br></blockquote><br><br>  It is also noted that in the period from 2000 to 2008, employment in the industrial sector increased in almost all industrialized countries.  Now a <a href="http://www.robo-hunter.com/news/ot-lydei-k-mashinam-robototehnicheskaya-revolyciya-v-kitae">similar trend is observed in China</a> , Brazil and other countries in transition, where more and more robots are being used.  Over the above period, their number in Brazil has increased almost 4 times, and productivity and employment - by 20%.  According to a study, employment in manufacturing is higher in countries where <a href="http://www.robo-hunter.com/news/infografika-venchurnie-investicii-v-robo-sferu-v-2010-2014">investment in robotics</a> continues. <br><blockquote>  ‚ÄúGermany and Japan have invested heavily in the automotive industry, the development and introduction of robots, with the result that the two countries retain production leadership in terms of product quality.  In addition, employment in the automotive sector has significantly increased in Germany ‚Äù, -‚Äú The Positive Impact of Industrial Robots on Employment, ‚ÄùMetra Martech, November 2011. <br></blockquote><br><br><h3>  Important aspects of the growing number of robots being introduced </h3><br>  Peter Gorle, one of the authors of the study, noted three important aspects of the growth in the number of robots being introduced, namely: <br><ul><li>  Robots operate in areas where people are unsafe to work. </li><li>  Robots perform tasks that are not economically viable with high wages. </li><li>  Robots perform tasks that humans cannot do. </li></ul><br><br>  Marlin Steel, Baltimore, USA, is an excellent illustration of the research conducted in terms of using robots in an unsafe human environment.  Many years ago, she began automation, the benefits of which are felt not only by the company, but also by employees. <br><br>  Drew Greenblatt, director of Marlin Steel, acquired the company in 1998.  Then the staff received $ 6 per hour and manually produced 300 parts per hour.  ‚ÄúIt was a boring and monotonous job, unsafe and with poor product quality.  Today, our employees receive $ 25-30 per hour plus bonuses and bonuses.  Each worker follows 4 robots that produce 20,000 parts per hour, and their quality exceeds all expectations.  Last year was one of the most successful in our history: we exported our products to more than 30 countries and increased the number of employees 4 times.  Thanks to the use of robots, work has become interesting and safe. ‚Äù <br><br>  Odense Steel Shipyard, Denmark is a good example of how robots save jobs in high-wage countries.  Shipbuilding in Europe has experienced a decline in the past few years, but robots have become the key to improving the performance of the Odense Steel Shipyard in Denmark.  The company has invested in autonomous robotic welding systems, thanks to which it has increased its efficiency 6 times in comparison with manual welding, has speeded up the production process several times and has increased the quality of the product. <br><br>  The report also says that the growth of technology industries, such as pharmaceuticals, electronics and semiconductors, depends largely on robots that provide opportunities for improving quality, accuracy, speed and consistency, which could not be achieved with manual work. <br><br><h3>  The future, where robots will have a huge impact, is just around the corner </h3><br><blockquote>  ‚ÄúIn the future, robots will be used everywhere.  Both the number of industries and their range of applications will grow.  Robots will be able to seriously contribute to the development of the service sector, in particular health care, since the elderly will need help, and those who can provide it are not enough.  Robots will also play an important role in the transportation and provision of domestic services.  They will help ensure safety and act in emergency situations ", -" Positive employment impact of industrial robots ", Metra Martech, November 2011. <br></blockquote><br><br>  The next generation of robots will lead to an increase in the number of jobs in the <a href="http://www.robo-hunter.com/news/5-udivitelnih-faktov-o-roste-rinka-robotov">robot industry itself</a> .  The study authors estimate that 300,000 people are already involved in the industrial robots sector, and another 45,000 will be needed over the next 5 years.  Thus, the <a href="http://www.robo-hunter.com/tags/robototehnika">sphere of robotics</a> can be one of the first in the number of <a href="http://www.robo-hunter.com/news/k-nam-idut-professii-budushego">new jobs</a> . <br><br>  <strong>About the report</strong> <br>  The authors investigated companies with more than 250 employees in the following sectors: <br><ul><li>  Automotive industry </li><li>  Electronics </li><li>  Food and Drink </li><li>  Plastic </li><li>  Chemistry and Pharmaceuticals </li></ul><br><br>  The report focused on 6 countries: Brazil, China, Germany, Japan, the Republic of Korea and the United States. <br><br>  Metra Martech is a specialist <a href="http://www.robo-hunter.com/uploads/files/56cde1e23231a.pdf">in analyzing industry and economics</a> , and among its clients are governments of various countries and international organizations. <br><br>  International Federation of Robotics </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/390999/">https://habr.com/ru/post/390999/</a></p>
